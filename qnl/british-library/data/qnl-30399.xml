As X understand it we are not in any way concerned in, or responsible for, any lana, of whatever kind reclaimed or barren, which the Shaikh may have got by accretion since 1914. All our promise covers is to securing to him the land he was actually in possession of in 1914. Any land which he now holds extra to the 1914 area must be settled between the Shaikh and the Iraq Government according to the Iraqi hand h a w and is not a matter in which His Majesty’s Government have any concern. j 3 . With regard to the offset suggested in paragraph Bateman’s telegram to the Foreign O-’fice, no.lbl of the 24th June, 1 disagree with his suggestion as you will see from paragraph 3 of my telegram ho.490 of the P'Hh June, and will take this point up in the letter w'hich i propose writing ' 1 of to the India Office from Bahrain. K 7 4 . With regard to your paragraphs 3, 4 and b. j. do not quite understand your points, rhe whole virtue of bringing in the Land Settlement is that the 15 years tasarruf comes first, and should be easy enough to prove, Ithe Shaikh has categorically said he can do so), and documentary evidence of title comes last. Since no one, as far as we know, is in possession of any part of the Shaikh’s property, though there / Captain G*S*de Gaury, MC., i?olilical Agent f Kuwait•r there are some clai ma nts in the field, the question of adverse possession to t?M ch you refer nould not seem to arise. 5 # While of course it is impossible for the Shaikh in the course of the next fortnight, before you and 1 meet, to prepare his case in detail, it should be possible for him to give you some general idea of the strength of his tj^sjarruj^ position on the lines indicated in paragraph 2 of ray tele gram ho # 50 f 7 of today’s date.

I am not sure about 'Gardens' in the pledge of 1914 covering barren land. If not the Shaikh loses from the moment the Land Settlement Law is applied, all the land between Fao Gardens and the Khar Abdulla, a potentially valuable development plot v&amp;ere the Railway terminus and a new port area may come one day. Thus we shall have a class of land in excess of the 1914 pledge but held prior to and in 1914, This is what I meant in my telegram. If we are not prepared to argue that 'Gardens' . include barren land I suggest that we should ask the Ifaq Government (in more appropriate words!) not to behave in a puerile way and immediately on application of the Law to the area seize the land (as apparently they can do by the Land Settlement Law) and announce it in the newspapers as another triumph of the Iraqi Cabinet on behalf of the Nation; which is the sort of thing which they are quite capable of doing. If they do the atmosphere in which the settlement has to be carried out will be most unsettled (and also of course British influence and reputation for ability to protect her proteges will go down another stage) 2./ The Hon’ble Lt.-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.K.,Political Resident in the Persian Gulf B U S H I R I£ .2 - 2 . Reference paras 4 and 5, I attach a letter from thi shaikh udiich explains the situation. I don’t know if you will think the time is now nearing for a British lawyer to come out to advise the Shaikh on the arrangement and checking of the documents, witnesses to produce etc. The worse the shaikh produces his case the more His Britannic Majesty’s Government lose. The Shaikh does not want to produce the case badly of **i course but oriental inertia and conservatism may lose him points which could have been saved by little encourage ment and supervision. It may therefore be considered a good insurance by the Treasury to send out someone from iSngland or Egypt to work behind the scenes here a little early next Autumn. It would be a help to everyone concerned. I would point out that the Shaikh has not yet obtained an Arabic copy of the Land Settlement Law (I am of course encouraging him to hasten to do so) and that his reply as to accepting the Land Settlement Law as a means of settlement was more than guarded. He throws the onus for equity upon His Britannic Majesty’s Govermaent but as it was pointed out that Land Settlement could be applied at any time he was perhaps justified in this form of reply. Yours sincerely,Translation of a confidential letter No.R-5/135, dated the 15th Rabi* Thani 1355, corresponding to the 4th July 1936, fran His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwait. After Compliments, ^ In reply to your letter No.C-235, dated the 14th Rabi Thani 1355 (3.7.36), regarding your enquiry about the nature of our proof Tasarruf in the case of our properties, I have pleasure in informing you that we enjoy the possession of our properties according to the rules observed by landlords of the Basra Liwa. Here I can give you an outline cxf the rule in practice: We appoint our own agents and T, Baricar 8 ,, (overseers), estimate the fruit, and give our privileges as landlords on the 'DhaBELn* system (monopoly), as the public interest may dictate. We, also, enjoy the fruit and other garden produces in accordance with the obaerved rules. Moreover, in order to elucidate the question more fully I attach hereto an approximate table of the form of practice used in the administration of our properties. We have also got some documents from the Liwa authorities which indicate the legality of Tasarruf. Above all, it is not unknown to His Majesty’s Government that we have always been landlords with full authority (Tasarruf) over our celebrated properties since the time of our ancestors. But we depend mostly on the nature of the findings of the Sublime British Government. Usual Ending.TRAHSIATIQN, Points that show the nature of Tasarruf we main tain over our properties. 1 . tfe have 001 official documents from the Ottoman Government in evidence of our ownership. 2 . There are receipts for the 'Badal al Jareeb ' taxes (tax on 100 palms) paid to the Ottoman Government up i to the British Occupation. 5 . There is an agent of ours at the property. This agent has la ways been installed since the olden times of our ancestors* He looks after the property, carrying out repairs etc. 4 . The yields at time of harvest . Bvery year we instruct our agent to call a committee from among the fellaheen themselves to estiumte the crop to be, and submit to us lists of the total produce to come. Then we direct our agent 1 h©re to put the dates under restriction, and appoint a representative from our end to give the dates on 'dhairan* (monopoly) to the fellaheen, according to the custom in practice among all landlords. 5 . *hen the dates are ripe enough we issue delivery orders for the landlords share directed to our agent. Most of these orders are in favour of Kuwaiti merchants, who forthwith send their dhows to receive the dates fraa our agent and entrusted officials at the properties?. 6 # Since the Occupation we hold no official receipts for the rt Badal al Jareeb ,, from Government , because our properties are exempt from the payment of taxes, under the pledge given by His Majesty’s Government. 7. There are bills frcm the gap Customs showing sup Plies .such as dates, fruits, firewood etc., which were every year exported for our household use. These bills- 2 - These bills used to coxae through the Political Agent, Kuwaituntil the enforcement of the 'Xstihlak' system of taxation. , , . i * f * 8. Among the decisive proofs is our being in manifest possession (Tasarruf) of our properties, and in such a permanent way as to admit of no opposition; also the administration of these properties by our officials and agents to the full meaning of the word 'Tasarruf', since the olden times of our ancestors. 9. Lastly, since last year X have appointed my son Muhammad as my authorized agent to manage these properties. He is now practising his authority and receiving the produce of the gardens.

Rendel took advantage of an interview with Nuri Pasha at the Foreign Office on &amp;End May (at which the Iraqi Minister and I were also present), to impress upon him tne urgent necessity for a comprehensive settlement of tne above question. Mr. Rendel referred to the fact that the origins of the whole problem lay in promises which had been given by His Majesty^ Government in the interests of the military operations against the Tur&amp;s in Mesopotamia whicn had led eventually to the emancipation of Iiaq as an independent State. 3. He thought tnat this fact ought to make tne Iraqi Government particularly anxious to cooperate in finding a satisfactory solution. Nevertneiess all attempts to effect a set lement hitherto had failed and the position was becoming steadily more unsatisfactory as claimants were encouraged, in the absence of a settlement, to try to dispossess the Shaikh of kuwait of portions of his properties. Mr. fiendel thought that that the time had now come to ta^le the whole problem once more on a comprehensive basis; it had been possible to effect an amicable settlement of the railway question and he could not s^e why the &gt; same could not be oossible in the case of the ShaiKh T s properties. It was surely a great pity to allow this question to drag on so as to impair relations not on±y between the Shaikh of Kuwait [ and Iraq but also between Iraq and His m ajesty T s Government. 4. Nuri Pasha said that he quite agreed with Mr. Rendel that a settlement of the question was desirable. He said that the Iraqi Government had much sympathy with the §haikh of Kuwait and had no desire to harm his interests • the tame time he would not conceal from us that the attitude of the Shaikh towards the smuggling campaign from Kuwait into Iraq had annoyed the Iraqi Government, the more so since the Shaikh nwver ceased to bring/ Cony sent to India•\qo; .£00$ xicr u I inns a icl tci w 9fiJ 29 t s n I I .6 \ i *19 VOc .cljiic: \ &gt;1 331 l •hra+o I .iD£3J2 f jnead fi * &gt;t^wui | r 3 JaifO | jiqaoo | 2BW . as os xl bnB I ^ I S J &gt;. :J II Sfll J Bll OilB | DliJOW I [ns 9^ I @ , - z - ( ( 1 oring wild ac usat-ions against tnem of infringing Jais territorial lights. Nuri Pasha saia that he personally would not allow the attitude of the ShaiKh over the smuggling question to influence him in regard to his properties in Iraq. Yassin Pasha, however, felt dibierently and according to Nuri r asha his resentment over the smuggling question nad led him to reject a proposal to introduce legislation cancel ing the arre rs of taxation technically aue to the Iraqi Government from the two Shaiichs. 5* Turning to the detailed points in dispute about the Shaikhs property, Nuri Pasha said it was not the fault of the Iraqi Government th^t cases had oeen brought in the courts to try to dispossess the Shaikh of portions of his properties. These cases had been /dnfined to one date garden which the Shaikh had bought during the Vvar, hut which ne haa for some reason failed to register in Tapu, although orue s had been given after the War that all such properties should be registered within a certain period The claimants, aided and abetted oy predatory lawyers wonting on a percentage basis, had tatten advantage of this technical flaw in the Shaikh's title to bring their cases. As regards the taxation aspect, Nuri Pasha was understood to say that he did not think tnere would be any difficulty in passing legislation to annul the arrears of taxation technically due from the Shaikhs in respect of the period previous to the introduction of the Istihiak tax. 6. Mr. hendel then told Nuri Pasha that His Majesty*s Government had been giving earnest consideration to the preparation of new proposals for a comprehensive settlement of the vhiole question and ne hoped that these proposals would be communicated to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad very shortly for presentation to the Iraqi Government. He begged Nuir ^asha to use all his influence to ensure tnat these proposals received the most sympathetic consideration by the Iraqi Government. Nuri Pasha seemed pleased at the idea of new proposals anu promised that he would do his best to secure an early settlement. Signed J.G. WARD. FOREIGN OFFICE, May &amp;5th, 193b.Telegram I,F.0.19 87. From British Embassy, ^ To Foreign Office, No Bushire, 23. Dated and received the i4th July 1936. Your telegram No.ll9_ Note was handed to Minister for Foreign Affairs July 12th and has on the whole been well received. During discussions on July 9th Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed doubts whether pending cases could be handed over to Land Settlement Officer. I have now however found a ruling by Court of Cassation of October 1934 whereby Land Settlement Law was declared to apply to all suits whether brought before or after application of that Law. Under this ruling (which has force of Law) pending suits must be transferred to Land Settlement Officers. I have strengthened note accordingly. Prime Minister called this morning. H© said that it must be realized that Land Settlement and TAPU Offices were at present fully occupied on Euphrates Gharraf end oil areas and that to apply land Settlement to parts of Basra Liwa would throw administrative machine out of gear. It was not impossible however and he would be prepared to do it ? Mut. in order to ? oblige His Majesty’s Government, be But he would/sharply criticised (and Govt is none too strong at the moment) unless he could ? that Shaikh who will benefit by this drastic step is ready to do something positive to help Iraq Government to cope with smuggling which is again on the increase and causing unnecessary bloodshed (see my despatch No.399). It seems to me that we have here a great opportunity to bring about a detente in relations between Iraq and Kuwait, •‘■raq Government are well disposed and2 ( 2 ) and only ask Shaikll , shelp to solve a baffling problem. I suggest that Political Resident in the Persian Gulf be authorised to (on his journey Home if Possible) again urge Shaikh to make helpful suggestions in his own interest.

A quid pro quo basis of implementing His Britannic Majesty Government’s pledge to Shaikh seems to me improper whatever we may think of smuggling. 3. 'If quid pro ino did enter into it it has to be remembered that Shaikh is (a) constantly attacked in Iraqi newspapers; (b) Frontiers of Kuwait are transgressed by Iraq; (o) Shaikh’s fellaheen in Iraq teve been stirred up a gains t him. 4.

(Copies by Bag) Sir, ^4 ^ With reference to ray despa tell Ho. 366 of July 15th last, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a trans- -— lotion of the reply from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to my note Ko. 347 of July 8 th last, concerning the properties in Iraq belonging to the bhaifche of Kowsit and ohanimersh. You will have seen from ray telegram Ho. 177 of July 14th that the Minister for Foreign Affaire was at first inclined to insist that a prior condition of the submission of the new proposals of His Majesty’s Covomraent to the Council of ministers should be the acceptance by the *&gt;haikh of tne arrsm^ements suggested to him last year by the Political Keoident in the Persian Gulf, whereby he could make a positive contribution to wards the efforto of the Iraqi Government to combat the smuggling of goods emanating from bowelt* he was supporteu in this view by the rime Minister and I received a note to this effect on July 16th. 3 . The aa^e evening, however, during a private and friendly talk at ray house, I was able to convince Hurl Said that the a sniggling proposals put forward by Hie Majesty’s Government last year need not be regarded as divinely Inspired and that, as the Jhaikh had flatly refused to consider them, it would per haps be asking too much to expect him to swallow them whole now. I suggested that the immediate purpose of the Iraqi Government would be served if the note were more elastically worded and the Ghaikh loft a certain latitude in regal'd to the extent of his co-operation with the Iraqi Government. I said that an un fortunate impression would be created in London and India if the terras of the note which I had Just received became known. /Finally, • Light Honourable Anthony Aden, M.C., M.P., etc., etc. , etc.Finally, mini '.'aid consented to take his note back and reword it in accordance with ay suggestions, oren though it night on- tail the Prime Minister’s displeasure. 4 . He has new done so t and l trust that the position will he viewed in a similarly acooamedating spirit by the Shaikh himself* should he continue in his non-posanmufi' attitude, I fear that n© progress will be made. It seem to be the definite policy of the responsible Iraqi Ministers to refuse to go out of their way to accommodate the Shaikh so long as lie refuses to assist in a matter which» in their view, ia one of importance. 5 . In previous correspondence on the smuggling aspect of this matter, the point has been stressed that the respons ibility for putting a atop to smuggling rests exclusively with the Iraqi Oovermaant; and this view might conceivably be put forward In support of further representations to the Iraqi Government designed to persuade them to treat separately the date gardens proposals of Ris Majesty’s Government. 6 . On the other hand, the 'Interesting cargoes' case in the United States of Asaerica last year, and the recent efforts of His Majesty's Government to protect North China against Japanese smuggling have not passed unnoticed in Iraq# There is an inclination to discern some inconsistency between the action which His Majesty's Government have taken in these cases and the argument mentioned In paragraph 6 above. 7 .

There is no doubt that Equity does not allow such aggressions on our lawful rights. Usual endingTRANSLATION* (COOTIDJ^TIAL). fl My Lord, The situation at Fao is bad to the extreme, it is intolerable. We are regarded as strangers to the property, not as landlords. Others do as they like in their properties, but we stop with our hands tied, before everyone* We note the ruin and destruction going on, but cannot do anything. Two days ago the Agent at Fao came to me and informed me of how the Mudir of the Fao Nahiya (district) acted towards him and the wrong words he spoke against him. Would that was for a mistake committed by the Agentl On the contrary it was for nothing, but the prevention of animals and such like, as landlords do in their properties. But I know why the Mudir had done so; it was just to threaten. Today the Agent came to me and informed me of further activities of the Mudir: he (the Mudir) hinted to the 'Taabah' farmers to revolt and give provocation. For example, as I have already informed you, I ordered the w -' • palms in Ibn Jubair f s garden to be cut down so as to build houses in their place. They were actually cut down two months ago, and nobody then said a word. The Mudir now directs them to prevent rooks being landed in the said garder claiming that they are landlords and asking us to prove our ownership to this land. Sir, the Mudir is not keeping at any limit, but I should like to take him with ease and policy in the beginning, although nothing will avail with him. I do not want to oppose him except when I lose all hope in H him. But you should in any way make some arrangement for the Fao property. There is no anxiety about other provinces, as they are registered at Tapu Department.CONFIDENTIAL. No. 641-3 of 1936.

We agree that the outlay involved would probably be a good investment and we understand from the Treasury that they take the same view. Whilst the actual briefing of the lawyer must clearly await the Iraqi Government's formal acceptance of our settlement proposals, the first step appears to be to get the Sheikh* concurrence and, as you suggest, to press him to bear part of the cost. 3. In writing to Loch you may think it worth while to enquire whether he can suggest any non-Iraqi lawyer in Iraq or Koweit who would be suitable. We realise that it would be probably unwise to rely on the impartiality of a lawyer of Iraqi nationality, but if a local man of some other nationality could be found he would appear to/ 1 .

I do not think that it is worth while pursuing Mr.Kendel»s suggestion in para*3 of his letter of 7th September.(p.z.6507). Ohere are no lawyers in Kuwait, ana those in Iraq are practically all Iraqi, or hand in glove with the Iraqis. I am strongly in favour therefore of briefing a really good man, when the time comes, from figypt. Knowing Arabic he would be able to make himself familiar with the Iraqi Land Law etc. without much difficulty. 2. With regard to para.2 of Mr.Rendel»s letters that the Sheikh should be pressed to bear part of the cost. Q?he necessity for having a lawyer at all has arisen from His Majeaty f s Governments provision of 1914,and l do not see personally that there is any call on the Sheikh to pay any of the cost. This being so, 1 do not think we can press him very hard, but the proposition in the first instance at all events might be put to him, and see how he reacts.(I note that 1 . 0 . letter of 19th August merely said n whether he(the Shaikh) would be willing to bear the cost”.

I enclose for your information a copy of a note hy Colonel Powle on these two points. 3. Colonel Powle’s provisional view about the first point (i-e. that regarding 'barren land') appears to amount roughly to this: if part of the land which was in the Sheikh’s possession in 1914 is declared to be mowat or ’miri sirf’ and confiscated by the State, then it is fair that the Sheikh should be compensated, if the land has any value, according to what would be likely to be its market price. This seems to be reasonable and we are inclined to agree with Powle. We are also.inclined to agree with him that/ &gt;tt Pox Esq., iign Office.2 . that it is unnecessary to say anything to the Sheikh at this stage, but that His Majesty’s Government might make up their own minds on the subject. We should accordingly be glad to know whether you agree with the view stated above. 4. As regards the second point, we agree with Powle that if the Sheikh is confirmed by the Land Settlement Officers in the possession of land additional to that which was possessed in 1914, it would not in any way affect His Majesty s Government s obligations to him in regard to the 1914 pledge or enable them to evade responsibility for compensating him in respect of land possessed in 1914 of which the Land Settlement procedure deprives him. Would you kindly confirm that you agree with this view? 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to Hale. Yours sincerely, % ' SMJ '• OUUSONNOTE By COLONEL T.C.

A case recently occurred of the Basra Port Trust wanting to taUd quarters on a piece of uncultivable land in the Sheikh's Fao property.

Copy se n t to India, No.410. (13 6326/18/93). FOREIGN OFFICE,S.W.l. 7th October,1936. Sir, Under cover of my despatch No.248 of the 4th June I transmitted to you a copy of my despatch No.359 of the 2nd June, to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, in which were set out and explained the new arrangements which His Majesty’s Government are proposing in the hope of finally liquidating all questions outstanding in connection with the date gardens in Iraq belonging to the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohanmerah. 2. You will recollect that in the last paragraph of that despatch it was explained that your telegram No.144 of the 27th May, reporting the death of Shaikh Khazal of Mohammerah at Tehran on the 25th May, had been received after the despatch had been drafted, and that the question of the obligations of His Majesty’s Government towards the heirs of the late Shaikhw ould now have to be examined. It was added that there appeared, however, to be no reason meanwhile to defer or modify the approach to the Iraqi Government on behalf of both Shaikhs on the lines laid down in the preceding paragraphs of thedesja tch. 3. After considerable further correspondence between His Majesty’s Embassy at Bagdad, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the interested Departments of His Majesty’s Government on points of detail and procedure, the new proposals of His Majesty’s Government were formally comraunicated to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs in a note from His Majesty’s Chargfe d*Affaires of the 8th July, a copy of which is enclosed herein for your information. You will observe that in paragraph - 13/ N.M.Butler Esq.,CV0., etc., etc., etc., Tehran.-2- paragraph 13 of that note it was suggested that the land settle ment procedure should be applied first to the properties of the Shaikh of Kuwait, and that the estates belonging to the late ohaikh of }?ohcmmerah should be dealt with subsequently* I concurred, in this modification being made in the original n 'i ' proposals, as set out in paragraph 16 of rpy despatch No#359 to His Majesty^s Ambassador at Bagdad, in view of the following considerationst (a) The British personnel available for carrying out land settlement in Iraq is now reduced to only two officers, thereby making more difficult their special attachment for work in connection with the Shaikhs* properties* (b) It appears that (contrary to the suggestion in paragraph 5 of my despatch No.359 to Sir Archibald Clark Kerr) the main properties of the Shaikh of Kuwait are distant some 12 to 20 miles from those belonging to the family of the Shaikh of Mohammerah, which would preclude their being included in the same settlement operation. (c) The need for land settlement is urgent in the case of the Kuwaiti estates, in view of the attempts which are being made in the Iraqi Courts to upset the Shaikh’s title. On the other hand there has hitherto been little i or no trouble as regards the ownership of the Mohammerah estates. (See paragraph 5 of my despatch to Sir Archibald Clark Kerr No.359), (d) The death of the Shaikh of Mohainraerah and the uncertainty regarding his succession has introduced a confusing element into the situation, which, it appears, might greatly complicate the task of land settlement. 4. No definite reply has hitherto been received from the Iraqi Government to the note of the 8th July from His Majesty’s Embassy. The Iraqi Prime Minister, after an attempt to link up a /■i erV -3- * I a settlement in regard to the Shaikhs* properties with the grievances of the Iraqi Government on account of smuggling from Kuwaiti territory, finally assured His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that he would be ready to give independent considera tion to the proposals of His Majesty’s Government and to lay them before the Council of Ministers on their own merits, although the proposals are still being considered by the Iraqi Government, Mr.Bateman was hopeful that their consent would be forthcoming in time for the preliminary survey (of the properties to be subjected to land settlement} to be put in hand this autumn. It is clear, however, that a considerable period must elapse before the preliminary survey and the actual land settlement operation can be completed in respect of the Shaikh of Kuwait’s estates. In view, therefore, of the decision not to press for the concurrent treatment of both sets of properties, many months are likely to pass before there can be any question of the estates of the Mohammerah family coming under land settlement • 5. At the same time, as explained in paragraph 5 of my despatch No.359 to sir Archibald Cla rk Kerr, His Majesty’s Government are aiming as far as possible at a comprehensive settlement of the outstanding points connected with the properties of both Shaikhly families, and without prejudice to the eventual decision which may be taken as to the application of land settlement to the estates of the late Shaikh of Mohammerah, they hope that it will be possible to induce the Iraqi Government to dispose of the taxation aspect in regard to both sets of properties on the lines proposed in paragraph 6 of the note addressed by Mr.Bateman to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs on the instructions in my despatch No.359. Apart from the eventual possibility of a claim arising against His Majesty’s Government in respect of land alienated from the estates /estates of the late Shaikh of Moharamerah in the course of land settlement (see paragraph 8 of my despatch to Sir Archibald Clark Kerr No«359), the question may, therefore, arise before very long of the compensation due from Majesty’s Government (in accordance with the pledge given to the late Shaikh in 1914) in respect of indirect taxation levied by the Iraqi Government since the introduction of the Istihlak tax in 1932 on produce from the estates belonging to Shaikh Khasal in Iraq# 6. Before the question of compensation can be considered it is clearly necessary to decide the extent to which the assur ance given to the late Shaikh of Moharnmerah in 1914 regarding his lands in Iraq may be held to be binding in‘respect of his heirs, in view of the fact that the Shaikhs of Moharmerah no longer possess any autonomous status. Preliminary consideration of this problem has, however, convinced me that further information is necessary in the first place concerning the heirs themselves and the arrangements whicn are likely to ensue for the future ownership of the properties in Iraq. 7, I shall be glad therefore to receive any information which you can furnish as regards the heirs to the property of the late Shaikh, and generally as regards the probable arrangements for succession to the lands in the possession of Shaikh Kazal at the time of his death. The division between the heirs of the Iraqi estates belonging to the late Shaikh would presumably be a matter for the Iraqi Courts ana in accordance with the Sheri’ Law, but I shall be glad to learn whether any information is available on this point. Further, while His Majesty’s Government have not so far decided whether it would be wise or practicable to discriminate between bhai^h Kha^al’s heirs in the allocation of any compensation, I shall be glad to learn your opinion as to the relative merits olthe L,-5- x - o 0 various heirs, judged by t heir behaviour towards the late Shaikh. 8. Another point upon which I should welcome your observa tions is the probable attitude of the Persian Government towards such of the heirs as are still resident in Persia. Are they likely to be allowed to receive undisturbed - as I believe shaikh Khazal was allowed to do - the revenues from the family properties in Iraq, and in particular any sum which might be allotted to them by His Majesty^ Government as compensation under the 1914 pledge ? The fact that certain of the heirs are apparently seeking to acquire Iraqi nation ality suggests the possibility of the formation of antagonistic Persian and Iraqi cliques among the heirs. This might result in discrimination against the Persian heirs in the Iraqi Courts when the division of the estates comes up for decision (e.g. the provision of Iraqi law forbidding foreigners to hold land in Iraq might be invoked), and I shall be interested to learn whether you consider that in such an event the Persian Government would be likely to give diplomatic support to the cause of the heirs who remained Persian subjects. 9.

Sir, With reference to my despatch No.359 of the 2nd June, I transmit to Your Excellency herewith a copy of a despatch to Hi3 Majesty’s charge d’Affaires at Tehran regarding the position of the heirs of the late Shaikh Khazal of Mohammerah in connectior with the new proposals of His Majesty’s Grovernment for a comprehensive settlement of outstanding questions concerning the properties in Iraq of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah. 2. You will observe from paragraphs 6-8 of the enclosed despatch to Mr.Butler that I am anxious to obtain as much information as possible in regard to Shaikh Khazal’s heirs and the general question of the succession to his former properties. I shall be grateful for any observations which you may have to offer on the various points raised in those paragraphs. It may in fact prove easier to obtain accurate information in Iraq as to the succession to the Mohamraerah estates, since it appears that the control of at least the Iraqi estates of the family is vested in the late Shaikh Khazal’s agent at Basra. I prefer, however, to leave it to your discretion whether or not to instruct His Majesty’s Consul at Basra to make any enquiries from Khan Bahadur Mirza Muhammad, in view of the risk that such enquiries might give the agent the impression that His Majesty’s Government had already decided to pay compensation to the heirs. 3. I shall, in particular, be glad to receive any information which Your Excellency can furnish regarding the probable proced ure in the Iraqi courts for the settlement of the succession to / is Excellency Sir Archibald Clark Kerr,KCMG., etc., etc., etc., Bagdad.2 r to the Iraqi iproperties of Shaikh Kha^al. I should be interested also to learn whether the adoption of Iraqi nationality by some of the heirs would strengthen their claims as against the heirs who remained Persian subjects; for instance, could the technical prohibition of the ownership of land in Iraq ty a foreigner be used for the purpose of excluding the Persian heirs from the succession? 4. Finally, I shall be glad to learn whether you consider that there is any risk of advantage being taken of disputes amongst the heirs by outside elements to put in claims to the ownership of any of the lands in question. It has hitherto been assumed that the title of the late Shaikh to his properties in Iraq was fully secured. In the event, however, of a risk of outside claims to these estates materialising it would seem desirable to hasten as far as possible the application of the land settle ment procedure to the Mohammerah properties. On the other hand, as pointed out in the letter from the Chancery bf His Majesty’s Embassy to the Eastern Department No. 107/40/36 of the 2nd July, it would certainly appear difficult for the land settlement procedure to be carried out before the rival claims of the various heirs have been settled in accordance with Iraqi law.

My furtner comments are as fo 11 ows . I 3 0 In the first place, with all due respect to Hale, the Arabic word NAKHIL as used in the pledge does not mean ’♦gardens or plantations consisting of date palms'* but the whole extent of the properties owned by the Shaikh in the area in question. ,Vhen, for instance, an ’Iraqi wishes to buy a property on which palms are grown the term NAKHIL is used to cover the whole estate though only part of it may be planted with date trees. (In point of fact besides date palms large quantities of vegetables are also grown in the so-called date gardens). In other words the term NAKHIL is equivalent to our ’’estates’* and as used in /_ Q in the pledge covers all the Shaikh’s properties in the area concerned to whatever extent they are cultivated or not cultivated, 4, Moreover ’’gardens'* or 'estates’* ( whichever term one lixes to use; all over the world contain portions which are not cultivated, tut the legal interpretation of such terms is surely concerned with their boundaries , and not with the fact that pieces within these boundaries are or are .not c ultivat ed, 5 0 ;/ith these considerations in mind it seems to me personally that it is qsite impossible either in equity or law to exclude 'a barren area lying outside the planted area' (vide Hale's letter) from Hie Majesty’s Government's pledge of 1914.

(K 7307/18 93) VOirsiCrU OFFICE, 3.1.1. 2 nd December, 1935, Sir, The competent departments of His have had under consideration Mr.Bateman 1 (107/75/36) of 20th August last, regarding certain aspects of the new proposals for a final settlement of the titl* of the Shaikh of Kuwait to his properties in Iraq. 2. In paragraphs 1-5 of nis despatch, Mr.Bateman discussed the attitude which His Majesty’s Government should adopt towards the possibility of the Shaikh being deprived of one or more pieces of ’’mowat M land,(i.e. land which is not c&amp;pable of ciltivation), which had been included among the properties covered by the promise of November 1914. His Majesty*s Government share Mr.Bateman* s view that it would not be desirable to assure the Shaikh in advance that he would be compensated automatically for any piece of such land which might fall within the scope of the 1914 pledge, particularly in view of the consideration mentioned in paragraph 5 of that despatch, viz. that such a categorical assurance might cause the Shaikh to neglect the preparation of his case. At the same time, without wishing to commit themselves to any definite procedure, they have given consideration to the question of the line which should be taken with the Shaikh in the event of the loss of such land materialising, and they have arrived at the conclusion set out in the following paragraph. 3. After consulting the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in the course of his leave in the United Kingdom, His His Excellency Sir A.Clark Kerr,KCMG., etc., etc., e u c., Bag dad. Maj esty* s/® nr - 2 - Uaj esty's Government are inclined to think that a fair ani editable arrangement would be to judge on its merits each cage in which the Shaikh had been deprived of the ownership of a piece of -mowat' land, which could be shown to have been definitely within the properties covered by the pledge. It appears, in fact, that such land my vary very much in potential value, since, while some pieces might be entirely useless, others (like the piece of land which was recently taken by the fraqi Government for the purpose of building a labour camp in the neighbourhood of Fao) might prove to have considerable it pc: for the construction of buildings, the erection value as sites tor tne of plant etc. In the event of pieces of 'mo*at« land pacing from the possession of the Shaikh to that of the Iraqi Govern- '.ent, it should be possible to estimate whether it possessed ary 'site value', if necessary after enquiring from t.ie Iraqi Govern raent wt* t use they intended to make of it. Should it appear that the Iraqi Government intended, either immediately or in the future, to utilise the land, the final.h be ailotted a sum of money in compensation which would be ^ equivalent in amount to a fair ground rent. On the other o•**»ri t n nave no obvious value u* s hand, if the lana appeared to have uo i raq i government declared that they had no intention use of it, there would seem to be no obligation to pay any compensation to the Shaikh* a i rfifMiltv in such an arrangement would 4 . The odious difficulty in no P v id ent immediate use, but come over land which might have a orove to possess value in years to which might nevertheless prove If the -«• •«*•* ** “ ti0 n he or his heirs, might seek to without any compensation ne, maintain that the 1914 piomise had not oee'Vfulf iU el. a risk, however, is almost inseparable from any form ofcompensation based on estimated value, and it clearly would not be possible to allow the Shaikh or his heirs to re-open the question of compensation. A final decision would, there fore, have to be taken after careful consideration, due allowance being made for the possibility of the land acquiring h 2 j,te value** £it a lat er date. r - In paragraphs 6 and 7 of his despatch, Mr.Bateman went on to suggest that any gains of land (e.g. in the nature of natural accretions), which might accrue to the as the result of the application to his properties of the land settlement procedure, might fairly be set off against any land of which he might be deprived in the course of the same operation. Hia Majesty’s Government do not feel able however to approve this suggestion. They consider that the promise given to the Shaikh’s predecessor in November 1914 covered the whole area of land then in his possession, and that consequently any compensation dae on account of tne loss of part of that land must be paid irrespective of any gains ou. side the area owned by the Shaikh of Kuwait in 1914. It would moreover be difficult in any case to maintain that the Shaikh was beholden to His Majesty's Government for causing his properties to be thrown open to land settlement, since the land settlement procedure derives from ordinary Iraqi legisla tion and is, in fact, intended to be applied in due course to the whole area of Iraq. 6. I note from paragraph 7 of Mr. Bateman's despatch that he was doubtful whether the Shaikh would find it to his advantage to invoke the 1914 boundaries of his properties. ■i of v i ew of His Maj esty ’ s Gov er n- It ia however from the point of vie o exactly those boundaries, so as to ment important to ascertain e 4 -v, ir. liability to the closest limits of be able to confine their Uab-l ythe pledge they have given. In this connection I should perhaps explain that it was at first proposed to insert a paragraph in the instructions contained in my despatch No.359 of the 2nd June requesting Your Excellency to invite the Iraqi Government to issue special supplementary instructions to the Land Settlement Officer ha helling the case to endeavour to ascertain, in the course of his enquiries, the exact boundaries of the lands in Iraq held by the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah in 1914. 7. After further consideration, however, it was decided that it would not be desirable to approach the Iraqi Government on this point in the first place. It was felt that to do so / l might give a false impression as t o the readiness of His Majesty^s Government to compensate the Shaikhs and thus possibly influence the Iraqi Government towards taking little pains to fall in with the comprehensive settlemert proposed. Further, it might encourage the Iraqi Government to think that His Majesty’s Government did not mind what happened to any properties acquired by the Shaikhs after 1014. The matter was, however, only left in abeyance, and if and when the Iraqi Government accept the proposals of His Majesty’s Government and are prepared to issue the necessary instructions to tne Land Settlement Officers, it will be for consideration whether they should not be approached in the sense mentioned above. 8. It had been intended, on receipt of the despatch under reply, to adopt Mr.■Bateman’s suggestion that the opportunity might be taken to consult Mr. Brower and Mr.Aston personally during their leave in the Uni: ed Kingdom on points connected with the new instructions. Unfortunately, owing to pressure-5- pressure of other work some delHy ensued in taking the necessary action to this effect, and it was impossible to establish contact with these gentlemen before they returned to Iraq in the course of September.

Accordingly, the courts have the right to require these agents of the Shaikh to accept service in connexion with cases instituted against him, and any such agent declining to accept service will have applied against him the legal procedure applicable to persons declining to accept service. in/In view of the reasons stated above and of the insistence of those concerned on claiming their rights, the Iraqi authorities concerned have been compelled to instruct the competent courts to carry out service formalities in accordance with the usual procedure, the said authorities being of opinion that it is neither just, nor a requirement of the public interest^ that Iraqi subjects should continue to be denied the right to sue His Highness l the Shaikh of Koweit, while cases instituted by him against them are entertained. The Ministry avail themselves of this opportunity to renew the expression of their highest consideration and esteem. .s Britannic Majesty 1 s Embassy, BAGDAD.By JrfyMail. P.Z. Wl l 19.

Provided, therefore, that you see no strong objection, I shall be glad if you will inform the Iraqi Government that His Majesty's Government regret to note that the Iraqi Govern ment have seen fit to issue instructions which make it easier for actions to be brought against the Ghaiich of Kuwait in the Iraqi Courts in respect of the ownership of his date-gardens in Iraq. There seems no reason to add that there are doubts as to the validity in Iraqi law of these instructions, but you should proceed to inform the Iraqi Government that, while it is true that suits brought against the Shaikh of Kuwait in respect of / 0.A.Scott, 5}sq.,D.3.0 etc., etc., et . , et c *, Bagdad.- 2 - Lvf oi nis j. eai property in Iraq would normally have come within the scope of the exception admitted by international law to the general rule of immunity from process of foreign sovereigns, His Majesty s 'Government nave never in the past been willing to assist in the service of documents upon His Excellency, since they feel that, in the special circumstances surrounding these cases, no obligation rests upon them to do so, but on the contrary a positive obligation does rest upon them to prevent such action from being brought, so far as they find that possible. furthermore in the view of His Majesty’s Government, the Iraqi jove^. nment share this responsibility for safeguarding the Shaikh’s possession and ownership of his real property in Iraq, and they consider that the Iraqi Government are under an international obligation not to allow actions to proceed against the Shaikh in respect of that property. 4. You should then, I consider, point out to the Iraqi Government that to facilitate the service of documents upon the shaikh will probably encourage a flood of actions against him, which, in the event of the Shaikh losing his cases, might prove highly embarrassing to the Iraqi Government. You should develop the arguments contained in paragraphs 9 ani 10 of my despatch No.262 of the 27th April, 1936, adding, if you think it necessary, a hint to the effect that His Majesty’s Government would not be afraid of referring the matter to arbitration. For your own confidential information, it must be remembered that the Law Officers of the Grown advised in 1934 that in the event of recourse to arbitration there would be a reasonable possi bility of its being held that the Iraqi Government are bound to implement the undertakings given to the two Shaikhs. 5* If, despite the explanation of the position as it appears to/-3- to His Majesty’s Government, the Iraqi Government are unwilling to cancel the instructions already issued, and if, in the event of these instructions being successfully contested in the courts, they proceed deliberately to create by special legisla tion an easier procedure for bringing actions against the Shaikh, they would be acting in a particularly unfriendly manner towards His Majesty’s Government, They would also be taking a financial risk, since if the shaikh were dispossessed and had to be compensated, His Majesty’s Government would feel obliged to press even more strongly than in the past their claim that the Iraqi Government had inherited the 1914 pledges.

Mote dated the 23rd September 193 7, to Mr.M.J.Clauson, India Office, Londop. Subject. Kuwait Date Dardens.Mr, Clauson. Pate Gardena. I agree generally with the Foreign Office graft and am thankful that something concrete seems likely at last to materialise. I have always been infevour, as I think have the 1.0., of splitting up the Ate gardens question into two parts, (a) taxation, and (b) possession, and taking one s tep at a time. 'Comprehensive' agree ments in regard to date gardens, or any other Gulf pro blem, look well in Whitehall but do not work out on the spot. 2, The w eak point in the F*0. scheme ? as you point out, is that it offers contingent indemnities in respect of pre-1932 taxation and future discriminatory taxation to the Mohammerah heirs, and refuses the same contingent relief to Kuwait on entirely inadequate grounds. The fact that the Shaikh of Kuwait has exercised his undoubted in ternational rights in refusing to co-operate with the Iraq Government over an entirely different matter- smug gling - in no way connected with his date gardens, cer tainly does not justify H.M.G. in discriminating against him. 3. He may, or may not, accept the F.O. offer as it stands, but he will undoubtedly be strongly inclined to refuse it when he knows that he is not getting the s ame terms as the Mohammerah heirs. That he will know this is, of course, certain, even if the heirs were asked by us to keep this part of the arrangement confidential. If the Shaikh did accept the F.O. offer as it s tands, knowing that better terms were being offered to the Mohammerah heirs, he would only do so with a sense of grievance, and if he refuses it the mere fact of its b eing offered in these/-7. T - 2 - these cir-cumstances would in itself be a grievance, whereas the main point of a settlement of this ques tion is to eradicate any s ense of grievance from his mind. It is essential, therefore, that the ®me terns should b e offered to the Shaikh as to the Mohammerah heirs, either, as you suggest, by bringing Mohanmerah terms in line with the Kuwait ones or vice \ersa. Tvir* rdmmond's compromise might also be suggested to tte F.O. 4. My own view is that once H.M.G. have settled wiufi the Shaikh of Kuwait, the Iraq Government will sooner or later try to (1) demand arrears of taxation from the Shaikh of Kuwait; (2) apply discriminatory taxation against him. Of these (2) is much more likely than (1). But these are r isks that the Shaikh of Kuwait is in just as good a position to judge as we are, pos sibly better, since he keeps in close touch with Iraqi affairs and knows several Iraqi politicians personally This being so, he can refuse or accept the F.O^ offer on his ov/n r esponsibility, whatever is its final form, provided always that he gets the same terms as are offered to the Mohammerah heirs. 5. I have made some pencil notes toning down the F.O. views as to the Shaikh's 'obstruction' re smug gling, which I have initialled to distinguish them from yours* Sd/- T.C.Fowle.

The position is as follows; ,7e hold that juridically the Shaikh of Kuwait is an independent soverign. Therefore in international law he has immunity in process from foreign courts, i.e. those of Iraq,. 3ut in cases where title to real proper ty is involved international law admits an exception to the general rule conferring upon soverigns this immunity. Te are, therefore, not in a position to refuse transmis sion of documents for service on the Shaikh on the sole ground that he is a soverign (paragraph 4 of Foreign Office letter of 27th April, 1936). J/e therefore have shifted our position from the general legal ground to the particular political ground as explained in para graph 6 of same Foreign Office letter, and further we will not assist service of documents on Shaikh (ibid paragraph 7). If we were to assist result would be a flood of actions against the Shaikh (paragraph 8 ibid) which might prove embarrassing to the Iraqi Government as explained in paragraph 10 . 2. These arguments of political expediency were, however, not conveyed to the Iraqi Government as a scheme for a comprehensive settlement of the date gar dens question under the Land Settlement Law was evolved by the Foreign Office, vide their letter of 2nd June. / r \ ^ 3 # This scheme failed, however, owirhg to insistence of the Iraqi Government in linking date gardens with smuggling (see Baghdad telegram of 14th July, my tele gram of 16th July and Foreign Office telegram of 17th July, 19 36). I The Iraq Government have nbv» forced the issue authorising the courts to issue substituted service iR 2 ) - ,z&gt; /)• 12/ on the Shaiich'a agent in Basrah, vide Baghdad letter of 27th August, 1937, and these instructions have now actually been carried out, vide Kuwait telegram of 18th November. Presumably Iraqi law does not provide for substituted service since Ambassador points out that by changing the law they could make such service legal. 5. &lt;Ve can now defend the Shaikh 1 a case (a) on the preliminary point that substituted service is not legal under Iraqi law and (b) if this fails, or if it succeeds only for the moment and the Iraqi Government amend the laWjon the merits* 6 . With regard to the merits of the case. The case in question consists of the claims against the Shaikh of the heirs of Zuhair (Kuwait telegram of 18th November) in the Fao Estate (vide list enclosed with Baghdad despatch No* 70 to .Foreign Office dated 8 th February, 19 36)* 7« Immediate action is for Shaikh to brief a lawyer Jj ' ) to try and get a dismissal under (a) of claim or, at any ikt rate, an injunction for stay of proceedings until (a) is decided* 8 . A lawyer from Egypt should also be briefed by His Majesty’s Government to examine and to prepare to take up (b), which v/ill inevitably come into court sooner or later. »* c- Bahrain. 8.12.1937.

His Majesty 1 s Embassy present their compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending in their Note Verbale No. 4^9 of August 2?th last regarding the service of judicial documents on His Highness the Shaikh of Koweit. 2. The Embassy are instructed by His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to inform the Ministry of the regret with which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have learned that the Iraqi Government, (as stated in the Ministry’s Note Verbale No.27/3/9068 of August 19th), have seen fit to issue instructions with a view to facilitating the bringing of actions against the Shaikh of Koweit in the Iraqi courts in respect of the ownership of his date gardens in Iraq. 3. While it is true that suits brought against the Shaikh of Koweit in respect of his real property in Iraq would normally have come within the scope of the exception admitted by international law to the general rule of immunity from process of foreign sovereigns. His Majesty’s Government have never in the past been willing to assist in the service of documents upon His Highness, since they feel that, in the special circumstances surrounding these cases, no obligation rests upon them to do so, but on the contrary they are under a positive obligation to prevent such action being brought, so far as they find that possible. Further more, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, the Iraqi Government share this responsibility for safeguarding the Shaikh’s possession and ownership oi his real property in Iraq, and they consider that the Iraqi Government are under an international obligation not to allow actions to proceed against the Shaikh in respect of that property. 4./ ■r @ Lu a Je*V» aibacay are laatrictc.i to point out timt any action taken to facilitate the service of , oeunonUi u, »a he haikh -sin probably cnc jurage a 3 loo , of ac ion HX&amp; whicJip In tlio cv©nt jf the iilmlkh loeln.g hi© oa«e©* mifrt prove hi hly eiberraaala: ud even prejndieial to the Iraqi oovemaente % ilia Majeety** ; srfbaeay are thereto e to express the ho:&gt;e that* in ^11 the oireuitetai'ieea# he competent &lt;iepfirt ient of the Xra&lt;il aovemiwmt win be willing to ea^cei the inetntetlan hat have actually been teaued to the Court© and to abate In from ©n^r further leglalation ieaigned to facilitate the brlxt m &lt;:iX act Ions against the r haikh of owe it in reopect oi the ownership of hie ate gar ens In Iraq# (&gt;♦ His aleety ’ a nftmasy would in thla coimecti m remind the Inistry that in a Hot# :;o*3U7 of July 8th# 193$ § addressed by His ajesty # s Charge iVnffaires to His Exeetteney '•^lyi url^-al— ai # cos^preheuaivc proposals werput for^’^r . far the soitlaKaont •..if all problems arlslxti out of the exlete ;oe n Iraq of properties bel ngiiig to the nhaikho of K owe It a. .-i Vobrnmumh* His * ajesty^ Kubaeoy have not yet been favoured with the views of the competent Iraqi authorities la regar to those pi'opo©al©f the application of which would* in the opinion of Hie Majesty’s OovernMent# amply safegoerii the rl Xv i, of all Iraqi j ubjeet ^ v^ho Jiave claim© connected with these properties# while excluding the possibility of « y legal i^eseures bci^ taken on the lines foreshadowed in the iniiJtry’e Hole under reference; the adoption of which »euld W contrary» in the opinioa of His Majesty’s QeveaMKnii# te the a areata of all concerned* His aje©ty f s Entenaiy venture tharef ore to urge in conclusion that renewed coast--er tIon may be given by the Iraqi Oavemaiesit to the proposals eon: in r* Batenen 9 s Sole of i : ul.CONFIDENTIAL.

'V Jlwf JrJ I v ; is it l i VP.Z.7556/37 IMMBDIATB* India Office vi/hi tehall, S.W.i 24 th November 1937 Dear Ward, Please refer to your letter of the i7th November 6172/53/93) about the aervice of legal documents on the Shaikh of Kuwait, As you will see from the Resident's telegram of the 19th November, of which a copy was sent to the Foreign Office on the 20th November (India Office letter No,F*Z» 7556/37) the situation has worsened by the serving of a summons on the Shaikh's lawyer by order of the .Basra Court, It has therefore become urgently necessary that representa- the orders issued last August enabling documents to be served on the Shaikh’s representatives. If the Embassy prefer to do so in the terms of the note enclosed in Scott's letter of the 15th October we are prepared to agree, but we think it necessary that reference should be made to the facts now reported by the Resident, and of course that t the representations should be made at once. We suggest that the Embassy should be instructed to seek if possible that the summons should be withdrawn, and at any rate to press the Iraqi Government to hold proceedings in suspense until they have reached a decision on the Embassy's note of the 8th July 1936. We note that in the Embassy's opinion the most helpful solution lies in the application of the Iraqi Land Settlement procedure to the Shaikh's estates, a consequence of which would be the transference of J. G, Ward, Esq,, Foreign Office, S • W«1«- 2 - m ' of pending suits to the Land Settlement Offices. 3« If representations at Bagdad should be unsuccessful, or possibly before their result is known, it may be necessary to advise the Shaikh with regard to proceedings in the Basra Court. With a view to consulting the Political Resident, we should be glad to have the advice of the Foreign Office on this and in particular on the question whether Shaikh should be advised to enter an appearance through his representative and to contest the legality of the service of the summons. This question was raised by the Acting Resident in his telegram of 25th September (copy to the Foreign Office under India Office letter of the 28th September, P.Z.6350/37) but it was not discussed with Sir T. Fowle while he was in England recently, as it was decided to defer this question in view of your despatch to Bagdad of the 29th September (see our telegram to the Gulf No.2484 of the 13th October). 4. We not^/frora paragraph 2 of Scotts letter that the Iraqis are still bent on linking any offer with the question of smuggling from Kuwait. We suggest that the Ambassador might be reminded of Foreign Office telegrams of the 17th July 1936, Nb.133, and the 15th January 1937, No.16, and urged to continue his endeavours to keep the treatment of the two questions separate • although nothing can yet be said on the matter to the Iraq Government Sir A. Clark Kerr is aware, from the meeting with Sir T. Fowle held in Renders room on the 1st -fcloveraber, that there is some hope that the Shaikh may shortly be induced to abandon or modify his present attitude on the question of smuggling.CONFIDENTIAL.

As you Vi ill infer, the Iraqi Government have now periaitted a case to be brought against the Sheikh which may lead to his being dispossessed of some c£ his date-gardens, This they have done by issuing new regulations which permit of the service of writs on the aheikh'e agent in the absence of the htikix himself. as His . ajesty's Government are interested in ensuring that the Sheikh shall lose as little of his ±914 property as possible, (since they wou^d have to compensate him for any part which he lost) it is felt - and woe in fact decided in 1920 - that he should be giv ;n expert legul assistance. But it m y be impossible to find an impartial xmycr in Iraq, and in th t case we may have to aek you whether it ia poesiDxe to obtain the services of a suitable lawyer in gypt. The lawyer should have a good knowledge of Arabic, and be acquainted with the t ttomv n Land Law, frith those qualifications he ought not to have too much difficulty in mastering the statutory additions made to the Cttoman Code by Iraqi negiaxauion. 4. we understand t*.at the case is to be opened in the Basra courts on the 5th January, and we shouxd accordingly bo grateful if you wou±d have a preliminary look rouiid to see whether a wuitabxe lawyer could be found in Egypt in the event cf Ciaj a K err reporting that a reliable and impartial man c, nnot oe found in Iraq 5 ./ terndele Bennett Cairo.V'*o Z. 5. But although it ia desirable that the lawyer from pgypt, if it is decided to engage one, should be in Basra before January 5th, it is not absolutely essential, since the iihefith &amp;as already been asked to engage a local lawyer to plead the Preliminary point that the regulations allowing vicarious service are invalid. XX this preliminary point is over-ruled it will be necessary to defend the case on its merits, but the hearing cf the substantive part of the case might not come off for some time after January 5th.

The Zuhair lawyer, Jalman ash 5haT?waf, who, it is common knowledge, has improperly acquired rights in debt over his ward, the aad son of the late Abduxla Zuhair, has already indirectly approached the Sheikh - _ *ho will take no action, unless auvisec - , &gt;or a settlement out of court on behalf of the heirs. 5 .

The best course therefore still seems to me to obtain now a distinguished lawyer from ijgyot, to become ^u /ait with the case, and to advise the Sheikh’s lawyer in the preparation of it. Incidentally his mere presence nay, and probably, will, deter the third-rate uhair lawyer. He could then return to Tgypt and await developments. 5 # Abdul Jalil Partu seems a good nan nd, given this backing, should do well in protecting the kheikh’s interests in and out of court. 5 ^ How, in my opinion is the time to show that 'we mean business' by the employment oi an outside lawyer, without him, I fear we may see the case uescending into a cark and long drawn out intri hie by ^raqi lawyers. y * x should and that 1 believe that this service of doounants 'ipon tiie i^heilcli's lawyer ia authorized, the writ of execution in the Ba.hiya oaee, which it will be reueiabered went a.gainst the Uieikh on appeal ef- ! » ooirld be served, and judgement executed, without further reference.

I do not wish to com lioate or obscure the main points of the present case in the Iraq courts against the Sheikh but I should I think add the following items of information if only to show how tiresomely the case may become surrounded in intrigues if we do not let in some daylight by the employment of a lawyer of repute from outside Iraq. .-.bdul Jalil Fartu is a close relation of Nuri *asha as said, and the latter is even now staying with Partu’s family in Beirut. Nuri, Partu told me, left Iraq hurriedly, not, as the newspapers say, for reasons of health, or/and high politics, but because his very successful reception in Basra recently, frightened the present Cabinet and Nuri thought it healthier to leave. 4 . Abdul Jam Partu moved to Basra from Bagdad I believe to avoid political complications, and he is inevitably suspected of being a -Nuri man-, is not likely to nght strongly unless he has outside backing, a case which will inevitably have sane-national- and -political- side to it. 5 . on the other hand Salman Sheikh Daoud and his father hive always been in the thick of Bagdad politics and both have been and may still be, member of Parliament. 6 . i agree with the Ambassador that one is reluctant to guarantee the integrity of any Iraqi lawyer. »Hon’ble Lt-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowl©, K#CaI»S| * * Political Resident Persian Gulf V -Or t Note.

Admittedly, one might, under Ottoman law, have expected the interest in Sheikh Mubarak’s properties to be inherited in common after his death by all his heirs, as happened on the death of Sheikh . hazal of Mohammerah. That is what Mr. Brower seems to be getting at, and if this is what indeed happened the part owners or what we usually call the Sheikh of Eoweit’s date gardens may no doubt by now have become legion. 3. in fact, however, (although we have heard before that other aeiabers of the oh.ikhly -‘.auily ' /e pro^e.tj in Iraq, and have for instance told them that they caj.uot claim immunity from service in the s ame way as the Sh.iUi himself) we have always assumed here that the Shein is the sole owner of the properties covered by the 1.14 pledge. It is, for instance, as you will remember, proposed, if and when His Majesty's Government give compensation for the amount paid in latlhla* tax since 1932 in respect of the gardens covered by that pledge, to pay the whole «aoney to the Sheikh and obtain a ^charge from him and him alone. At any rate nobody seems ever to have given any thought to any other proceeding. ierhaps/&gt; 2 . Perhaps sone special arrangement applies in this particular case, by which the property is handed down intact from one ruling Sheikh to the next? We should be grateful for any light you can throw on the matter. 4. The point is of some practical interest, since (1) no privilege in respect of service of documents can be claimed by any member of the family except the ruling Sheikh, and it would hardly seeu that his privilege would be effective to cover properties of which he is only a part owner. (2; it is a question whether our pledge extends to gardens owned by persons other than the ruling Sheikh for the time being, when there still is a Ruling Sheikh. yours ever, (Sgd.)

The garden property of oheikh siubarak now In aestion descended to his aale heirs - see attached lists - and is therefore registered in the Tapu Lepartmant records of Iraq as 'to the male heirs of Sheikh i ubarak', j&gt; In accordance, however, with a custom by no means rare, one member of the family, sheikh Ahmad in this case, continues to administer the estate, oheikh Ahmad issues an annual allowance fixed by him (not a distribution up to the limit which the net profit would make possible/ to his coheirs in appropriate proportions. He does so without it heinw a recognized private .aqf, and without any P^/er of attorney or written permission from his coheirs, ny h are paid all expenses, wages etcetera, end by him are ^ receive all increments, and^either case is previous consent of his coheirs required. They may, and do, for ' example after the shipping away of the harvest, query the amount they are receiving annually and in fact hold the head of the family responsible to them. 5 . Briefly therefore the coheirs have given one of •u 41 v* h't the head of their family &gt; full their member, sheikh rdhuad, uju fiscal responsibility, in accordance with a well known custom, in the administration of the late Bheikh Mubarak*a gardens* -,v.j +- rt twr»a correctly the names The attached list gives cor,cu ^ , heirs and their inheritors living of AheiKh Mubarak's male heir an 1st February, 1938 •pbe Lt-Colonel, Sir ‘frenohnrd Fowle, K*C.-.e3*» Political Resident, Terslan Gulf. 41: f ti i 1-2- (You will notice that the public notice in lieu Df service of sum ana, which was recently published at the instance of the Zuhair lawyer, and a copy of which I sent to you under Printed Letter No.C-49 of 2nd February, is incorrect in that it caai s the naiaes of All bln sheikh Lialim Al # L&gt;ubah, Maryam, Hussah, nisha, ^uboekah, daughters of sheikh Salim Subah and Hussah, wife of oheikh Nasir a 1- bubah and Loolwah and oharifa, daughters of sheikh Hasir Al-Subah.)• t&gt;. (a) Two points should perhaps be made quite clear. Firstly that the Feadaghiya estate, the estate now in question, was registered by sheikh Uubarak in the names of his male heirs, and to them and to their heirs it has in fact descended. The daughters of Mubarak, and their descendants do not receive a share as they might have expected under the Moslem law of inheritance, which share they do receive m the case of other gardens covered by our 1914 promise, for which Sheikh Ahmad is also the administrator. The explanation according to the surviving male heirs of Mubarak, and their descendants, is that the Feddaghiya garden was itself the ^ultOis^t or the third of property disposable by testament under Moslem law. (b) A second point Is that the duty of administration was previously in the hands of two former &gt;alers of . u in their order of succession i.e. Sheixh Jabir and then - a,™ 1 1 devolved upon Sbeikh Ahmad and iiheikh Salim, from whom it u.. that neither of these two former administrators had powers 0 , attorney or written authority to administer the estates, given to them by their coheirs.

(c) Jhetfcer our pledge extends to g rdens ownea by persons other than the Ruling Sheikh for the time being, when there still is a Ruling bheikh. The answer to (b) and (c) seems to be, subject to your opinion, to be clear, (a) Privilege cannot be held to extend to anyone other than the Ruler, (b) Our pledge must extend to other persons so long as they are 'd scendents' of Sheikh Mubarak, which all the present owners ar^, ,vith regard to (a) I trust that it will be decided .hat payment can and should be made to the nuler of Kuwait, administrator of the estate, ana a discharge obtained from x im. as all payments of all kinds in connection with the estates have so far been made to him I see nothing against it. If it is considered essential in order to cover His ^Jesty’s Government his general dischar e to us, could include signed acknowledgements by all the other heirs that the payment to Gheikh Ahmad had discharged the obligation but X ao not think xhat we should go farther than this, and, for example, attempting a direct settlem nt with each heir, alter a state of affairs in which the descendants of Mubarac have acquiesced iGl over twenty years.

Sir, i With reference to Foreign Office letter E 6944/53/93 of the 2nd December, enclosing a copy of a telegram addressed to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, regarding the attempts which are from time to time made to bring cases in the Iraqi Courts against the title of the Sheikh of Koweit to his date gardens in Iraq, I am directed 3y Mr. Secretary Eden to r equest you to inform the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury that he has recently reviewed, in consultation with the Secretary of State for India, the whole question of tne properties in Iraq of the Sheikh of Koweit and the late Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah. 2. As Their Lordships are aware, certain proposals for the final liquidation of this question were communicated to the Iraqi Government in a note from His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires at Bagdad on the 8th July, 1936, (see Foreign Office letter E 4766/18/93 of the 5th August, 1936) in which the following were the principal paragraphs: '5. The problems involved concern:- '(a) the possession of the actual areas in question; '(b) taxation. '6. As regards (fe), the proposals of His -ajesty’s -Government are the following. They are prepared to make -no further claim against the Iraqi Government for the -exemption of the properties of the two sheikhs from -taxation in Iraq, provided that the Iraqi Government 'will* for their part, -(a) give a formal undertaking in writing, to make no claim/ Secretary to the Treasury.2 . ’’claim for arrears of taxation against either sheikh ”in respect of their properties in iraq, ’’and ”(b) provide a formal written assurance that no ’’discriminatory taxation will be imposed upon the ’’properties of either in future. ”7. As regards (a) the possession aspect of the matter, ”His Majesty’s Government propose, as an integral part ”of comprehensive settlement, that all uncertainties ’’should now be removed in regard to the boundaries of ’’the sheikhs’ lands in Iraq and a formal title be ’’awarded to them, through the application, to the areas ”in which the lands are situated, of the procedure laid ’’down in the Land Settlement Law of the 23rd May, 1932”. 3. As a corollary to these proposals, it was intended that as soon as they had been accepted by the Iraqi Government and put into effect His Majesty's Government should compound their obligations to the two Sheikhs under the 1914 pledges by making lump sum payments, either to them or to their legal representatives, in return for the final abandonment of all claims inrespect of the possession or taxation of these properties. It was also proposed that these payments should be equivalent; “tot (i) the losses which the estate of each sheikh was estimated to have incurred since 1932 as a direct result of the Iraqi Istihlak or produce tax, together with, (ii) the losses which each estate might be expected to incur in the future from the same cause, calculated at so manv vears (perhaps 23 years) purchase of the present average annual loss. 4. But it has unfortunately proved impossible mainly owing to political difficulties since July, betv/een Iraq and Kov/eit, to make 1936, towards securing the acceptance any progress3 by the Iraqi Government of the proposals set out in paragraph 2. These difficulties centre around the vexed question of smuggling. The Iraqi Government contend, not altogether without reason, that a great deal of smuggling takes place from Koweit, where customs duties are low or non-existent, into Iraq, where customs duties are higher, and that the Sheikh of Koweit could stop this smuggling if he chose. Theresult is that, although the Iraqi Government seem prepared to consider the 1936 proposals in themselves, they are unwilling to do so while the question of smuggling is unsettled. So strong in fact is their feeling that His Majesty's Ambassador regards it as hopeless to press the question unless the Iraqi Government can be given some degree of satisfaction or assurance on this 5, The Sheikh of Koweit, who is in his turn incensed over various frontier incidents, is unwilling for his part to : o further in the direction of satisfying or reassuring the Iraqi Government than to agree that, upon the completion of certain negotiations in which he is now engaged with the Saudi Arabian Government for the termination by Saudi Arabia of the Koweit blockade, he will be willing to discuss the conclusion of an anti-smuggling agreement between Koweit and Iraq, although not necessarily on the lines of the anti-smuggling agreement which is expected to form part of his settlement with Saudi Arabia. At the same time the Saudi Arabian Government make the conclusion of a Saudi-Koweit Trade Agreement (i.e. the termination of the blockade) dependent upon the simultaneous conclusion of agreements relating to frontier relations and extradition. Every eiion; of these negotiations to a c a final s ettlement between K far off, while a settlement even in sight. ettlement between Koweit and Saudi Arabia is still Every effort is being made to bring the whole gotiations to a close as quickly as possible, but settlement betv/een Koweit and Iraq is not 6 ./6. It might seem from this brief description of the situation that the obstacles in the way of a final solution of the problem of the Sheikh of Koweit's date gardens in Iraq are of the Sheikh's own making. So to some extent they are. There is, however, another side to the picture. In the first place, although it is true that much smuggling takes place from Koweit into Iraq, the smugglers themselves are practically all Iraqi subjects and the smuggling is largely financed by Iraqi merchants, while the Iraqi Government have hitherto made no real attempt to establish an effective preventive service on the frontier, on the ground that, if the Sheikh were a good nei^ibour, he would save them this expense. They have likewise failed to take certain steps in Iraq itself which would tend to decrease the smuggling. In the second -lace, although the Sheikh could doubtless put a stop to smuggling if he wished, he could only do so as things are -t present by greatly impoverishing his State. This is the reason why he attaches so much importance to the prior conclusion of his agreements with Saudi Arabia. Koweit depends for most of its prosperity on the entrepot traae. In normal times this trade follows legitimate channels towards the interior of the Arabian peninsula. At present it follows illegitimate channels towards Iraq, channel at all Koweit would starve. If it followed no The Sheikh can therefore nithmiah he would prefer on assert with some reason that, altho g ^ alike to divert his trade into grounds of ethics and of legitimate channels across the Saudi Arabian frontier, he cannot afford, while the blockade of that frontier continue, to Stop it from taking whatever illegitimate channels may he available. 7. The Sheikh does not however regard himself as responsible in any way for what he regards as the results of the continuance of the blockade. On the contrary h, considers #». HI. r.spons.b «.5 . inasmuch as they undertook to do their best to secure the termination of the blockade, and have so far failed to do so. Here again, the Sheikh's own acts have on occasions rendered a settlement more difficult, but, after making all allowances for these acts, the fact remains that His Majesty's Government have failed to make good their undertaking to end the blockade, in the same way as they have, in the Sheikh's eyes, failed, for whatever reason, to secure the exemption of his date gardens in Iraq from taxation or from the threat of alienation. 8 # In these circumstances the Secretary of State for India, after consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, considers it most desirable from the point of view of the general position and prestige of His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf to make it clear to the Sheikh that His Majesty's Government are willing to honour their obligations in regard to the date gardens in so far as is at present possible for them to do so. Mr. Eden agrees with Lord Zetland in thinking it desiraole that steps shall he taken to remove as far as possible the Sheikh of Koweit's grievance in regard to the 1914 pledge. 9. At the same time Mr. Eden is anxious that the position of the heirs of the late Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah shall he taken into consideration. Kis Majesty's Government have already agreed that the heirs shall he treated collectively for the purposes of the 1914 pledge not less favourably than Sheikh Khazal himself would have been. Neither the Sheikh nor his heirs are responsible for the difficulties which have so greatly complicated a comprehensive settlement with the Iraqi Government, and it would be inequitable and would create an unfortunate impression if any settlement of/of their claims that was otherwise possible were to he delayed by political dissensions between Koweit and Iraq, all the more as the heirs are for the most part heavily in debt and in urgent need of any funds that they can obtain. Moreover there are signs that, unless a settlement is soon forthcoming, pressure will be brought to bear on their behalf in Parliament. 10. It is true that a complication has arisen in the case of the heirs through the lact that, according to recent information furnished by the administrator of the estates of the late Sheikh Khazal in Iraq, it is not possible for the heirs to fulfil the condition indicated in Lord Cranborne's personal and confidential letter to Sir Arnold Wilson of the 17th April (of which a copy was sent to the Treasury with Foreign Office letter E 1874/53/93 of the 22nd April) as attaching to the undertaking of His Majesty's Government to treat them no less favourably than Sheikh Khazal himself, i.e., that they should form some kind of joint family trust under an administrator with whom His Kajesty's Government could deal direct. The fact that many of the heirs are in debt for considerable sums to private individuals, some of whom have already obtained attachments from the local courts against the shares of the debtors m the movable and immovable property left by tneir father, alone renders this impossible. On the other hand the administrator possesses powers of attorney from all but two of the heirs, empowering him to act generally on air behalf, and there does not seem to be any reason y, if His Majesty's Government were to negotiate the tails of a lump sum settlement with the administrator, e administrator should not furnish His Majesty's vernment with valid discharges from or on oenalf of7 . all the heirs. His Majesty's Government might indeed make it a condition that the share in the compensation all the heirs should unite in giving the administrator a special general power of attorney. The fact that the heirs cannox form a family trust need not therefore preclude the liquidation of the taxation claims by a lump sum payment. 11. In order, therefore, to implement the 1914 pledges in the largest measure at present possible Mr. Eden and Lord Zetland consider that His Majesty's Government should now abandon the attempt to reach a comprehensive settlement of the 'possession' and 'taxation' aspects of the date gardens question, and revert to the earlier suggestion of attempting to settle the 'taxation' aspect separately from, and in advance of, the 'possession' aspect. This would mean that His Majesty’s Government would agree in principle to make lump sum payments both to the Sheikh of ^o.;eit ana heirs of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in settlement of losses on their Iraqi estates caused since 1932 oy the incidence of the Istihlak tax, and of future losses due to the same cause or (since His Majesty’s Government ought clearly to cover this possibility) to any other tax imposed (wiihout discrimination) on agricultural lands in Iraq which may later replace or supplement the Xstihlak tax. The somewhat complicated questions of detail connected - in both cases - with the calculation of the amounts of compensation to oe paid and - in the c ase of the Mohammerah heirs - of the procedure for effecting payment can best be left for later consideration when His Majesty’s Government have taken a • 1 ’nut a rough indication of the procedure decision of principle, but a rou n „,.t might ». foil-™* th « ° r OOTO .»..«o» .'■&gt; « °“ t of 0 °' P '“ aU0 ° “ &gt;, ifi below. In any case, in return for given in paragraph 16 belov , Qhpikh of Kov/eit and tne receiving lump sum payments, the ohei - • the ’heikh of Mohammerah would be required to „ heirs of the SheiKn uj.a written acknowledgment of the fact that this payment released His Majesty’s Government from their obligations under the 1914 pledge in respect of the losses suffered since 1932 by the imposition of the Istihlak tax and in respect of all future losses from that tax or any other ordinary Iraqi tax on agricultural production, more or less on the following lines: 'I do hereby acknowledge the receipt of the ’’sum of £ paid to me on behalf of His Majesty’s ’’Government in the United Kingdom and I recognise this ’’payment as a full discharge, binding on me ana my heirs ’’and successors equally, of the liability of that ’’Government, under the pledge given to Sheikh tt Mubarak -of Koweit j_ n 1914 , to compensate me for the Khazal of Mohammeran ’’loss I have suffered since 1932, or may suffer in the ’’future, by reason of the Istihlak or any other tax 'hereafter levied on landed property or agricultural 'production, in respect of the lands which I hold in I IXlfo clX* glc 0 ^ ^ ’’Iraq as a descendant of Sheikh ^g^alT’ 12. It will be observed that the proposed course of action would not amount to a complete settlement of the taxation aspect, since His Majesty's Government would not he formally absolved of any liability under the 1914 pledges in respect of pre-1932 arrears of taxation if these should be claimed j by the Iraqi Government and of any possible future discriminatory taxation. After full consideration Mr. Eden and Lord Zetland have arrived at the conclusion that it would | not be practicable or desirable to try to obtain from either of the parties a formal discharge of responsibility m respect of these two contingent rishs. An attempt to do so would introduce into the proposed action a serious complication and cause of dealy. The parties must be aware that in the absence of comprehensive settlement with uhe ..rani Gove they run a certain risk of further financial loss in the i'l14 ./ 9. future on these two grounds, and they would certainly not agree to give a discharge in respect of contingent risks covered by the 1914 pledge in return for nothing, or at the most a simple promise of diplomatic support if the contingencies subsequently arose. If His Majesty , s Governmentvere resolved to secure a discharge from further claims on account of these contingencies, it would be necessary to pay additional compensation, and even if agreement could be reached at all as to the proper additional sum it would only be after controversy v/hich would undo much of the good political effect to be hoped for from the payment of compensation for the losses caused by the Istihlak tax. Furthermore, it would be hard to justify the considerable extra expense which would be caused to His Majesty’s Government in the absence of any immediate risk of either contingency materialising. Finally, the fact that His Majesty's Government were trying to compound financially with the parties in respect of these hypothetical risks for the future would certainly become known to the Iraqi Government and might well merely have the effect of encouraging that Government to take some action such as reviving the dormant claim for the former land tax on the Sheikh’s estates previous to 1932, which they were prevented from levying at the time oy the British mandatory authorities. 13. It seems clear, therefore, that the best policy would be to aim at present at a limited objective, and to be content with an incomplete settlement only of the ’•taxation” aspect, rather than to raise dormant or hypothetical risks. Any suitable occasion that might arise would, however, be taken to try to extract from the Iraqi Government the formal assurances not to claim tax arrears or levy discriminatory taxation which were included in the 1956 proposals for a comprehensive settlement (see paragraph 2 atiove).14. Nevertheless, it will he convenient to reach agreement as to the line of action which should he taken hy His Majesty’s Government in the event of any loss falling at any future time on the Sheikh of Koweit or the heirs of the Sheikh of Mohammerah on account either of a claim for arrears of taxation or of the levying of a discriminatory tax. Mr. Eden and Lord Zetland are disposed to think that, in the light of present circumstances, any such development should he met hy diplomatic representations, and that His Majesty’s Government ought only to contemplate compounding financially for any loss or prospective loss if and when it was entirely clear that diplomatic action was not sufficient to obtain redress. In this event it would he open to His Majesty’s Government to consider whether they should endeavour hy arbitration to recover from the Iraqi Government what they had already paid to the Sheikhs or their heirs. (The Law Officers have advised that His Majesty’s Government have legally a good case). Account would in any case have to he taken, before any decision was reached to pay compensation, of (a ; the fact that, as mentioned above, the Sheikh of Koweit himself must he considered as partly responsible for the failure to reach a comprehensive settlement with the Iraqi Government; and (b) the peculiar situation caused by the multiplicity of heirs to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, their indebtedness to outside persons, and the impossibility of His Majesty's Government retaining indefinitely a divided liability under the 1914 pledge or of allowing the benefits of the pledge to extend to persons outside Sheikh Khazal's family (see in this connexion paragrafh 10 above). Meanwhile, in the event either of the Sheikh of Koweit or of the heirs of the Sheikh of Mohammerah enquiring as to the attitude His Majesty's Government would adopt if one or both of the contingent risks materialised, Mr./! Mr, Eden considers that the reply should simply be that, while in general His Majesty’s Government intend to fulfil to the best of their ability the obligations they assumed in the 1914 pledges, they cannot foretell the course they would take in such a particular eventuality and see no reason to anticipate the risks in question, 15. Under the proposed course of action the ’’possession” aspect would also remain, and the only hope of settling it finally appears at present to lie in keeping up pressure on the Iraqi Government to apply their land settlement procedure. The title to the Iraqi estates of the Sheikh of Mohammerah has not hitherto been challenged, but, as Their Lordships are aware, attempts are continually being made to dispossess the Sheikh of Koweit. The legal liability of His Majesty’s Government towards the Sheikhs (which the Law Officers have recognised) either to ensure that their possession of the date gardens is undisturbed or to compensate them for their alienation must be satisfied sometime, but this point must be left as it is for the moment until negotiations can be renewed with the Iraqi Government. 16, It has already been mentioned that Mr. Eden and Lord Zetland consider that the actual assessment of the sums to be offered in compensation and the various questions of details concerned with the distribution of the money can best be left until His Majesty’s Government have taken the required decision of principle. For the general information of Their Lordships it may be convenient, however, to record that according to figures submitted by the Sheikh of Koweit which appear reasonably exact the average annual loss suffered by him over the six years 1932-7 through the imposition of the Istihlak tax amounts (excluding certain alleged indirect losses which do not appear to be covered by the scope of the 1914 pledges) to about £1,100. In the course of interdepartmental discussion on this point in the past it has been suggested that a fair procedure would beto refund the actual proved losses since 1932 and to compensate for estimated future losses by paying a lump sum representing so many years ’’purchase” of the current annual loss. Alternatively, it may be better and less likely to involve bargaining and disputes to offer a single lump sum representing an increased number of years ’’purchase”. Mr. Eden understands that to produce an annuity of £1,000 for 25 years a sum of £16,500 would be required, allowing for interest at on outstanding capital. It seems likely, therefore, that a sum of some £25,000 to £30,000 would be a fair settlement with the Sheikh of Koweit. The position in regard to the losses suffered by the estates of Sheikh Khazal is more obscure, since the figures supplied by the administrator seem prima facie much exaggerated, inasmuch as they exceed those supplied by the Sheikh of Koweit for his estates, although the date gardens owned by Sheikh Khazal are understood to be regarded by the authorities in Iraq as having only half the bearing capacity of those owned by the Sheikh of Koweit. Further investigation is therefore likely to be indispensable before any estimate can be made of the amount of fair compensation to the heirs of Sheikh Khazal. 17. Their Lordships will have observed that Mr. Eden and Lord Zetland consider that the compensation of the two parties for their tax losses on the lines proposed above should, in view of the evident impossibility of arranging an early comprehensive settlement, now be carried out irrespective of the position obtaining between His Majesty’s Government and the Iraqi Government. The legal position between the two Governments must, however, be considered. The principal argument hitherto used against the compensation of the Sheikhs by His Majesty’s Governmnnt in the absence of an understanding with the Iraqi Government has been that this would, by constituting an admission/admission that His Majesty’s Government were hound to compensate the Sheikhs or their heirs if the Iraqi Government did not do so, weaken their basis for contending that the Iraqi Government had inherited the 1914 pledges, and so deprive His Majesty’s Government of almost the only weapon available to them for pressing the Iraqi Government to agree to give the desired guarantees (a) against the presentation of pre-1932 claims and future discriminatory taxation and (b) for the preservation intact of the existing properties. Actually, however, if the fact that His Majesty’s Government have compensated the Sheikhs or their heirs, or have embarked upon negotiations to this end, becomes known to the Iraqi Government before His Majesty’s Government have succeeded in effecting a settlement with the Iraqi Government on the lines indicated in paragraph 2 of this letter, the position will simply be that, instead of offering as a part of that settlement to refrain from making ’’any further claim against the Iraqi Government for the exemption of the properties of the two Sheikhs in Iraq”, His Majesty’s Government will be offering to refrain from making a claim (which they would make otherwise) for the repayment to themselves of the sums paid or about to be paid by them to the Sheikhs or their heirs. By compensating the Sheikhs or their heirs His Majesty’s Government would in fact be taking up the position that there was an obligation on the part of the Iraqi Government tov/ards them which, if the Iraqi Government failed to make it good of their own accord, His Majesty’s Government were entitled and bound to make good and to reclaim from the Iraqi Government. Whether the Iraqi Government really believe that His Majesty’s Government could in any case force them to recognise the 1914 pledges may be open to doubt, but, as the despatch to His Majesty’s Representative at Bagdad enclosed/3 \% r &gt; -&gt;4 / C jp 14. enclosed in my letter E 5224/53/93 of the 30th September indicated, His Majesty’s Government must not let the Iraqi Government suppose that they would not if necessary press them strongly to do so, even to the extent of arbitration. There is anyhow no reason to suppose that the direct compensation of the heirs would make them any less ready to believe it. On the contrary the formulation of a precise claim for a definite sum of money might render them more ready to do so, or at any rate more anxious to effect a compromise. For these reasons Mr. Eden considers that the compensation of the Sheikhs or their heirs in respect of tax losses on the lines proposed would not weaken the position of His Majesty’s Government vis-k-vis the Iraqi Government. 18. Mr. Eden will be grateful to receive at an early date the observations of Their Lordships on this letter and in particular to learn whether they concur in principle in the course of action proposed in paragraphs 11 - 15 above, on the understanding that the detailed points of finance and procedure alluded to in paragraphs 10 and 16 above shall form the subject of subsequent discussion between the three interested departments of His Majesty’s Government.

In reply, I am to request you to inform Mr. Secretary Eden that My Lords agree in principle that no further attempt should be made at the present stage to reach a comprehensive settlement with the Iraqi G-overnment, and that negotiations should now be opened with the Sheikh of Koweit and with a representative of the heirs of Sheikh Khazal, with a view to obtaining from them, in return for lump sum payments, written acknowledgments releasing His Majesty’s Government from any further liability in respect of all losses suffered as a result of the Istihlak Tax since its imposition and any future losses arising from that tax or any other tax on land or produce that may be levied hereafter 3* As regards the question whether an attempt should be made to obtain a formal discharge from liability in respect of the risks that taxation will be collected in respect of the period prior to the imposition of the Istihlak Tax, or that discriminatory taxation will be levied in future, My Lords agree that the risk of either of these contingencies materialising appears to be insufficient to justify the additional expense that would/ foe Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.Jli;' Ilfl f il f n l roU 1 2 . would probably result if the form of discharge were so drafted as expressly to release His Majesty’s Government from liability in respect of them. 4. The question also arises whether any communication should be made to the Iraqi Government on the occasion of the opening of these negotiations. The Iraqi Government are bound by the 1930 Treaty to implement the undertakings given to the Sheikhs, and My Lords are advised that His Majesty’s Government would have the right to recover from the Ira^i Government any moneys paid to the extent of losses actually suffered. While it is not the present intention to attempt to recover these sums from the Iraqi Government, circumstances might arise in which it would be necessary to make the claim and press it to arbitration. In order that such a claim may not be prejudiced, it appears to Their Lordships that notice should be given to the Iraqi Government of the intention to make a payment for which the primary liaoility rests on that Government. 5. This question, together with that of the amount to be offered and any other subsidiary questions, can oe dealt with by informal discussions between the Departments concerned. 6 .

The Shaikh’s telegram seems to have been a most uni ortunate blunder. Yours ever, (ogu) James Morgan.•application for a date to be fixed for hearing the action uguinat the ShalKh of Kuwait was made sorse aontha ago by the attorney for the plaintiff. A date was fixed and the Ministry of Juatioe replied to the Court's application to serve the susmons on the dhailch of Kuwait that it was not possible. Attorney for the plaintiff then declared in Court that Abdul Jalll Parto held a cenerol rower of Attorney from the Shaikh of Kuwait and that he should be served and that if his power aid not include the right to accept service then the uhalxh of Kuwait should be served either tlii’ough the British Consul. Basra (as the Shaikh of Kuwait was a British subject) or oy notice in the Press. She Court held that neither of these latter alternatives was possible under the law because service through Consul only applied in the case of foreigners resident within the jurisdiction of the Court and that service by proclamation and notice in the Press could only be allowed when the where abouts of the Shaikh were unknown whereas in fact hie place of residence was known. The Court however decided to serve hie Attorney Abdul Jalll Parto. This did not mean that the Court had decided in advance that they would compel Abdul Jalil to accept service. It was complying with the reguest oi t e plaintiff to attempt service on the Attorney wr.o could of ooars refuse to accept such service if not empowered. When the Bailiff attempted to serve Abdul JelU the latter refused and the Bailiff in accordance with APtiole kid o. the ^ivil Prooedtt Code served the summons in the presence of * witnesses. Ti is aid not mean that the Shaikh was effectively served. .bdul Jalil could have appeared in Court and said that his power of attorney did not permit him to accept service. The Court after confirming this statement by examining the Power of Attorney would in law be obliged to admit that the service was not good and the old Stalemate would recur. But in this case the Shaikh sent a telegram direct to the President of the Court stating that he had cancelled the rnwer/pow&lt;ir of attomoy givon to AMul Jalil. ^hon the Court rta-aBBttiabled this was discueaed. My Iraqi coll^aguue hold that thie tolograra was proof of sorvico. But in thu und tlie Court ad^oumod its decision for a week. During this week I happened to ho in Baghdad and privately diBCueeed the point with Dr owe r to see if there was any legal objection to the view that by sending the telegram at that particular moment the Chaikh had shown that he was aware that an action was being brought against him on a particular date which constitutes service. Mr. Drower agreed with me and I understand informed Captain Holt privately of this. On my return to Basrah the Court re-assembled and we held that the Shaikh had been served and ordered the case to be proceeded with against him in absentio. With regard to his partners in the estate who are co-defendants the Court found that their place of residence was unknown and that they should be served by notice in the press. This is being done.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00005f_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/5/147</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00005f</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/5/147</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 2/5 VIII Shaikh’s Date Gardens.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1936/1938</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-02-27T22:46:52</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (319 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the volume.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 321; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.

In particular, the correspondence concerns the service of judicial documents emanating from the Iraqi Government on the Shaikh of Kuwait in connection with his ownership of the gardens. The Political Resident, Bushire, together with the Political Agent in Kuwait and the British Ambassador in Baghdad mediate the talks between the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs in order to resolve the issue.The volume includes correspondence from the India Office and the Foreign Office discussing the issue of the Iraqi Government considering part of the Shaikh’s land as
                           mowat(land which is not cultivated because it is not cultivable), and therefore, to be confiscated by the state. The volume also includes correspondence from the Shaikh of Kuwait complaining against the Iraqi Government for putting obstacles in the way of his agents and officials administrating his properties. Upon request, the Shaikh provides a list of names of the heirs of Shaikh Mubarak who have rights to the date gardens.British Officials discuss a few other issues including: the court case disputing the Shaikh’s ownership of the date gardens having been prosecuted by the heirs of Ali Pasha Al-Zuhair at the Court of Basra, the cancellation of the attorney given by the Shaikh of Kuwait to his pleader in Basra, Abdul Jalil Partu, the suggestion of appointing an Egyptian lawyer to plead for the Shaikh at court, the importance of the Shaikh’s cooperation in taking anti-smuggling measures, the Iraq Land Settlement Law, and the British Government’s proposals for a comprehensive settlement of the date gardens issue.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="family"><namePart>al-Zuhair (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Al-Fāw</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Estates (land)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Suit of court</topic></subject><subject><topic>Power of attorney</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iraq</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Hakim of Kuwait Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Smuggling</topic></subject><subject><topic>Date Gardens</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00005f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
