Political Resident, Persian Gulf,ADMIOTSTKATION REPORT op the PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY and MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1885-86. PART I—GENERAL. 1.—MUSCAT, OMAN. A summary of political events at Muscat and in Oman during the past year by Lieutenant- Colonel E. Mockler forms the second portion of the report. 2.—PIRATE COAST OF OMAN. 2. This part has been somewhat disturbed during the past year, and hostilities have occurred between the tribes on land. 3. In May the son of the Chief of Umm-el-Kawain, Ahmed-bin-Abdullah, of the tribe Al-bu-Ali, quarrelled with his father and fled to Ejman, the Chief of which place, Rashid-bin- Hameyd, refused to give him up. The Chief of Umm-el-Kawain then allied himself with Sheikh Sakar-bin-Khalid_, Chief of Shargah, with the intention of attacking Ejman. 4. Shortly after the Chief of Umm-el-Kawain despatched two buggarahs, with 50 men and munitions of war, to a place between Ejman and El-Hajrah. The contents of the bugga rahs were landed partly at El-Hajrah and partly at Shargah, in support of the Chief of Shargah. 5. The Assistant Resident, Mr. Robertson, visited the Pirate Coast in her Majesty's Reindeer in the month of November, and touched at Umm-el-Kawain, but Shaikh Ahmed-bin- Abdullah evaded coming on board the vessel. 6. The Resident subsequently wrote to Shaikh Ahmed, saying that the Residency Agent had been instructed to demand from him a formal writing binding himself to abstain from the irregular conduct complained of, and that on his passing this paper his conduct would be leniently viewed. 7. In August the Residency Agent successfully mediated and brought about a renewal of the treaty of friendship between the Chiefs of Ejman and Hamriyeh, which was made by them two years ago, on the conclusion of hostilities arising out of the murder of three Hamriyeh subjects by some of the Ejman people. 8. About the end of November the Chief of Debay, having had some differences with the Chief of Shargah, united with the Chief of Ejman and raided the districts of Shargah and Ras-el-Khaimah. 9. Raids continued to take place between the people of Shargah and Ejman, and between the townships of Umm-el-Kawain and Hamriyeh, and the animosity among the tribes increased until January, when the treaty of peace between Shargah, Umm-el-Kawain, and Ras- el-Khaimah on the one side, and Debay, Ejman, and Hamriyeh on the other, came to an endj. 10. On the 20th of that month the Chiefs of Debay, Ejman, and Hamriyeh, with about 1,000 Arabs and a field-piece, arrived at Shargah, and a battle .ensued in which the people of Shargah were completely defeated, with a loss of 40 killed and 25 wounded, the assailants losing 5 killed only. 11. The Residency Agent interfered for the protection of the lives and property of British subjects, and held the Chief of Debay, Shaikh Hashar-bin-Maktum, personally respon sible for their safety, b6 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL 12. At the request of Shaikh Sakar -bin-Khalid, and on his written promise to abide by the terms agreed on^ the Agent then mediated between the parties, and peace was established on the basis of Shargah renouncing the alliance of Umm-el-Kawain. 13. In December the Chiefs of Ras-el-Khaimah and Shargah undertook a joint expedi tion against Shaam, a village which had revolted. The place was attacked and looted, and the people being unable to offer opposition solicited terms and agreed to pay an indemnity of 1,600 dollars, part of which was paid down at once. 14. The Chief of Bokha, having broken the maritime peace by proceeding with an armed force by sea, was written to and warned by the Residency Agent at Shargah. 15. Result of the pearl fishery on the banks fished by the Pirate Coast people last year was poor, and 250 divers are said to have died from deep diving. 16. In January the Sultan of Muscat expressed apprehensions concerning the intentions of the Chief of Abu-Dhabbi, Shaikh Zaid-bin-Khalifah, who, it was rumoured, intended to raid the Batineh Coast; and the Residency Agent at Shargah reported that Shaikh Zaid had placed himself in communication with the Sultanas enemies in the Sharkiyeh with a view to disturb the peace of Muscat territory. Subsequently, however. Shaikh Zaid disavowed any intention of acting aggressively towards the Sultan, and professed continued friendship for His Highness Sayyid Turki. 3.—BAHREIN. 17. In June a banian trader at Bahrein was assaulted by one of the sons of Shaikh Muhammad-bin-Khalifah, who was fined R 100 for the offence. 18. Portions of Moharrag and Manameh were flooded by the sea during unusally high tides, and most of the houses along the sea-coast were destroyed, 19. Owing to continued complaints about theft of cargo landed from mail steamers, Shaikh Isa has been urged and has promised to erect a landing-place and godowns for the accommodation of merchandise. 20. In February 1886 Muhammad-bin-Saud-bin-Fe} sal arrived at Bahrein on a visit to the Chief and remained about a month. After receiving presents he returned to Umm Hawaiz on the mainland. 21. The result of the pearl fishery of Bahrein last season was unfavorable, compared with that of the previous year. 22. The Chiefs of Bahrein maintained friendly relations with all their neighbours during the past year. 4.—NEJD, EL-HASA, EL-KATR. 23. In April, Ibn-Rashid attacked two sub-tribes of the Ejman who were encamped at the waters of Owaineh to the north of El-Hasa and plundered their houses and cattle. 24. The Ejman tribe, having subsequently received reinforcements, pursued Ibn-Rashid, El-Hasa. ^nd succeeded in recapturing some of their horses, and killing others. This incursion by Ibn-Rashid is said to be due to the Ejman tribe having some time ago attacked some people under his protection. 25. In November, the new Turkish Governor of El-Hasa, Nazih Beg, arrived at Katif from Basra to relieve Said Pasha. 26. Said Pasha is considered to have been the ablest and most conciliatory governor who has ruled El-Hasa since its occupation by the Turks. 27. In April a boat belonging to Wakrah was wrecked off Foweyrat and her cargo of El-Katr. plundered by the people of that place. No redress was mnm a ' j i t7&lt; afforded. In May it was reported that the Turkish gun-boat Mernlk had arrived at Foweyrat, and that the Captain had given a Turkish flag to the in- habitants with orders to hoist it on Fridays. 28. The Merrikh afterwards proceeded to El-Bida. tv 29 f m i e&lt;! i lins c . 0ntinued ; t0 exist between shaik li Zaid-bin-Khalifah and Shaikh Jasim-bin- am o£ -Bida, and several raids took place on either side ; both parties were reported to have made active preparations for hostilities, but no actual collision occurred during theRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1885-86. 7 30. In October, in consequence of a quarrel with Ali-bin-Rashid and Jasim-bin-Thani, some of the inhabitants of Wakrah belonging to the tribes of Al-bu-Ainain and Al-Jiran, and numbering about 1U0 men, in ten boats, left that place with the object of settling else where. 31. They ultimately settled at El-Ghareeyat in Katr. 32. In October, Shaikh Jasim-bin-Thani wrote to the Resident stating his intention of settling at Odaid. In reply, the Resident informed him of the orders of Government regard ing that place, and requested him to renounce his intention of going there. Shaikh Jasim having written again about this matter, the warning was repeated. 33. Subsequently, in November, on the visit of the Assistant Resident to El-Eida, in Her Majesty's Reindeer, Shaikh Jasim gave him to understand that he wished to submit himself to the British Government in all things. 34. A complaint was received from some banians who had gone to Bida. that Shaikh Jasim had asked them to pay E700 each, in refund of the fine of R8,000 levied from him by Government. Shaikh Jasim, in a letter to the Resident, admitted his having done so, but stated he had not yet taken the money from them. He was reminded of his promise to pro tect the banians so long as he remained at El-Bida, and informed tbat it would be a breach of agreement if he made the Hindus refund the fine, and that he would be held responsible. 35. In December, Shaikh Jasim sent a force to raid El-Gahreeyat. The village was plundered and four men killed. 36. At present Katr is in a somewhat disturbed state. 5.—EARS. 37. The Administration of the Province of Ears has continued to be in the hands of His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan, the titular Governor of Shiraz to whom the Sahib Diwan is subordinate. 38. Dissensions between the Sahib Diwan and the Kowam-el-Mulk resulted in the for mer tendering his resignation in April to the Zil-es-Sultan. The resignation was not accepted by His Royal Highness, and the Sahib Diwan and the Kowam-el-Mulk subsequently became outwardly reconciled. 39. His Ma jesty the Shah announced his intention of paying a visit to Ears, and officers were sent to the various districts to collect provisions. Owing to the bad harvest this unusual demand on the resources of the people caused much distress and gave rise to disturbances. In August, however, news was received that His Majesty the Shah had postponed his contem plated visit to Shiraz. This greatly relieved the public mind and caused a fall in the price of grain. 40. Much distress prevailed this year in the Shiraz districts owing to the partial failure of the wheat crop. The price of bread rose high and serious bread riots occurred in that town. Some bakers were punished by the authorities, but the persons chiefly to blame were the influential grain-holders who withheld their large stores in hope of profit. 41. Owing to the feebleness of the government of Ears, disturbances were rife throughout the province during the past year. 42. In April the Shahzada Muhammad Husain Mirza, who had been appointed Deputy ^ ^. Governor of Bunder Abbass and Lingah, arrived at Bushire en route to Bunder Abbas. 43. The Persian Government steamer Persepolis, carrying three guns and commanded by Captain Wolkowitz, arrived from Bremen in May. 44. In June the Motemen-el-Mulk tendered his resignation of the Governorship of Bushire, and Shahzada Nowzer Mirza was appointed in his place. 45. This appointment was subsequently cancelled, and Haji Muhammad Mehdi, Malek-ul- Tujar, was made Governor of Bushire and its districts. 46. An embargo on the exportation of grain was imposed from the 11th September. 47. In December the laying of a new submarine cable between Jask and Bushire was successfully completed under the superintendence of Colonel Champain, R. E., and Sir Henry Mance. 48. In January disturbances occurred at Baraz Jun in connection with the collection of revenue from the Khans of Dashtistan, necessitating the despatch of a foice from Shiraz. b18 ' ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL 49. In March the Amin -el-Sultan farmed all the customs in Southern Persia to Hajj Muhammad Mehdi, Malek-ul-Tujar, and appointed Safar Ali Khan to be Governor of Bunder Abbas. 50. On the 19th April the Wali of Lingah, Shaikh Yusuf, was murdered by his relative Shaikh Kathib. The widow and sons of Shaikh Yusuf fled to LlDeal1 ' Bassidore. 51. Ling-ah continued in a very unsettled state until September, when Shaikh Kathib applied to the Kowasim Chiefs of Oman for armed assistance. The Residency Agent at Shar ^ah, however, warned the Chiefs of Shargah and Ras-el-Khaimah against interference in matters relating to the Persian Coast, and nothing resulted from Shaikh Kathib's action. 52. Shortly after the Governor of Bunder Abbas, Shahzada Muhammad Husain Mirza, arrived at Lingah and confirmed Shaikh Kathib as Governor, fixing the yearly revenue at 190^000 krang. 53. The sons of the late Shaikh, Yusuf. of Lingah, and their mother, after residing a short time at Bassidore, proceeded to Kishm in June, on the recom mendation of the Amin-el-Sultan. 54. A furious gale blew over this place in April. The town was inundated by the , .,, sea and a great deal of property destroyed. Bunder Abbas. &amp; r r j j 55. The new Governor for Bunder Abbas and its dependencies, Shahzada Muhammad Husain Mirza, arrived at his post from Basra in April. 56. In August, Mirza Buzurg Khan was appointed Deputy Foreign Office Agent at Bunder Abbas. 6.—PERSIAN ARABISTAN. 57. His Excellency the Muzaffar-ul-Mulk, Governor of Arabistan, after staying some time at Felahiyah, again handed the government of Mohammerah and its districts over to Shaikh Mizal Khan. 58. The small Persian Government steamer Susa, of 36 tons, intended for the navigation of the Karun river, was completed in August by the artificers of the Versepohs, She carries guns and is not intended for cargo. 59. A reconciliation has been effected between the Governor of Mohammerah, Shaikh Mirzal, and his elder brother, Shaikh Muhammad. The latter is to reside at Sabiliyat and to receive a monthly allowance of 100 tomans; he has also been given a small date plantation. 60. In January the Resident, proceeded on tour in I. G. S. Patrick Stewart to Kharg, Koweit, and Mohammerah. 7.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN. 61. Early in the year the British bugla Nasree was driven ashore at Jask during a gale of wind, and part of the cargo was saved through the assistance of the telegraph officers, who subsequently received a present from the owner as salvage. ^62. The abducted slave Doshambeh, whose case was mentioned in paragraph 60 of last jeai s report, was surrendered in June by Mir Hoti; but as the slave elected to remain where he was, the case was dropped. 63. A disturbance occurred in August, in a village near Jask, in which some of the sepoys of the native infantry detachment stationed at Jask were concerned. An enquiry was held, and resulted in the ringleader being dismissed the service, and some of the non-commis- sxoned officers being reduced to the ranks by the military authorities. 64. The case of murder of Ali Bakhsh Khoja has been settled by deceased's brother accept ing S408 from Abdul Nabbi. 65. In Febiuaiy, Colonel Reynolds proceeded to Gwadur to satisfy the decrees given by the court of enquiry in favor of Arab and Indian claimants against the Rind tribe. . 66. Complaints were made by the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, of Sardar Mir Hoti's subjects damaging the telegraph line. 8—SLAVE TRADE. at zr;2 h V em0Val 0f I f er Ma;, ' est ^ s London &gt; which had been stationed for many years at Zanzibar, having caused a complete revival of the slave trade between Zanzibar and Arabia, tJ pit yZ ^ 18 ^ t0 ^ been P0ured int0 lhe lattoRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1885-86. 9 68. In the early part of the monsoon last year, when Arab craft begin to arrive from East Africa, none of Her Majesty's vessels could be spared for cruising in Oman waters, but in September three vessels were stationed off the coast, and on the 19th of that month Captain Dowding, in Her Majesty's Osprey, captured a dhow with 73 slaves on board, which was condemned with the slaves in the Vice-Admiralty Court at Muscat. The slave dealers in charge of the cargo were imprisoned by His Highness Sayyid Turki. 69. Ten days later Her Majesty's Banger captured a fishing-boat off Soor, with some slaves disembarked from a slaver a few days before. The fishing-boat and two slaves were condemned. 70. On the 16th September Her Majesty's Consul-General at Zanzibar telegraphed to the Resident that a dhow with a cargo of slaves had sailed from the Zanzibar Coast on the 11th instant. This dhow was not captured. 9.—OFFICIAL CHANGES AND HER MAJESTY'S SHIPS. 71. Colonel Ross, Political Resident, having been appointed to act as Resident at Hyder abad, left Bushire on the 29th March in mail steamer for Muscat en route to take up his appointment. 72.

A resume of what has been done in the Persian Gulf as regards the introduction of the Arabian date-palm in India, by Khan Bahadur A. U. Hakim, Assistant to Political Resi- dent, Persian Gulf, The Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Oudh, in his letter No. 4020, dated 18th September 1868, Lucknow, wrote to the Government of Bombay soliciting 1 a:-sistance in pro- curino- from the Persian Gulf, through the Resident there, a quantity of all varieties of the date-palm seeds, especially the El-Hasa dates described by Mr. Palgrave in i.is book of Travels through Central and Eastern Arabia. Copy of this letter was forwarded to Colonel Pelly (now Sir L. Pelly, M.P.) as per Gov ernment Resolution No. 2635, dated 1st October 1868, with a request to meet the wishes of the Chief Commissioner in Oudh. Accordingly Colonel Pelly, having procured the following nine varieties of date seeds,— m '*., Sisi, Khanizi, Zynadhini, Kasp, Kakab from Dashti, and Khedrowi, Gantar, Sameran, and Hallowi from El-Busra,—despatched them to India, advising the Bombay Government, as per his letter No. 141, dated 31st December 1868, of his having done so, and adding that he will be happy to assist in any further way he may be able in this interesting experiment. In his letter No. 2015, dated 18th May 1869, Lucknow, the Secretary to the Chief Com- missioner of Oudh wrote to the Bombay Government reporting that all the seeds of the date- palm sown in Oudh had germinated and were thriving; and requesting that directions be given that a further supply of the best kinds of stones be furnished annually to the Province of Oudh, and despatched so as to reach Lucknow in the month of January of each year. The Bombay Government forwarded a copy of the above letter to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, as per Government Resolution No. 1785, dated 3rd June 1869, requesting him to take the necessary steps to effect a compliance with the request of the Chief Commissioner of Oudh. On the 21st August 1869, Colonel Pelly wrote to Mr. P. J. C. Robertson, then a Vice- Consul at Busrah, requesting him to send a quantity of the best date stones obtainable. In reply Mr. Robertson wrote saying that a the palm is produced in this district by planting the offshoots which sprout around the foot of the female tree. It rarely vegetates from the stone, or should a single leaf spring up, as is sometimes the case, it generally withers on attaining the height of one or two feet. The stones being deemed valueless are not preserved, and they are consequently un procurable for the moment in any quantity. If you will kindly let me know by telegraph the number of either stones or plants you desire, I shall forward them to you by the first opportunity. The latter are extremely hardy and may remain for eight or ten weeks exposed without injury; their average weight is about 6 pounds.' In reply to Government Resolution No. 1785, dated 3rd June 1869, Colonel Pelly wrote, per his letter No. 187, dated 9th October 1869, that he had forwarded the required date seeds, and enclosed a precis on the cultivation of the date-palm compiled by Mr. J, C. Edwards, then the Uncovenanted Assistant Resident. The following twenty varieties of date seeds in their pulp obtained principally from the Dashti districts, were made into separate packets of 8 lb each, and sent to Bombay packed up in a box, together with two bags of date seeds, 7 and 6 lb each, from Bahrein, and one bag of seeds from Tangistan—Khanizi, Kabkab, Kandi, Shaker, Gantar, Hallowi, Maktub, Khush-kha-rek, Shaikh Ali, Shirinu, Kharu, Jowzi, Chehel-Gezi, Khatu-Shehabi, Nirid-Heni, Shahuni, Kayedi, Sisi, Rash, Kharek-Gutu. In his letter dated 27th October 1870, Bangalore, the Conservator of Forests, Mysore and Coorg, requested Colonel Pelly to aid him in introducing the Arabian date-palm in Mysore, adding that the palm would flourish in parts of Mysore, which were then overgrown with date-grass, a useless shrub, and that he was anxious to try whether this date-grass could not be replaced by the edible Arabian date, &amp;c., &amp;c., and further requesting to be furnished with any information on the mode of culture. Colonel Pelly, in his letter dated 3rd December 1870, replied that he would be happy to aid the Conservator of Mysore and Coorg Forests to introduce the date-palm into the Mysore country, and asked what number of male and female plants would be required. In leply the Conservator wrote, as per his letter No. 1216, dated 7th January 1871, that 20 male and 40 female plants would be sufficient for the experiment.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1885-86. 17 Accordingly a consignment of 20 male and 40 female date plants was procured from Busreli and despatched per B. I. S. N. Co/s steamer Penang to Beypore for transmission to Bangalore, and the Conservator was advised, as per No. 272-151, dated 12th March 1871, of this consignment, and further on the 22nd April of that year Colonel Pelly sent him copy of a report submitted by him to the Bombay Government on the 9th October 1869, on the cultiva tion of the date-palm. The Consevator, in his letter No. 450, dated 14th June 1871, intimated that the plants had arrived alive and had been planted in Bangalore. The Chief Commissioner of Oudh wrote to the Bombay Government, as per No. 3303, dated 13th July 1871, intimating that the experimental cultivation of the date-palm was so successful in Oudh, that a supply may be sent annually as requested in his letter dated 18th May 1869, and further adding that no seeds were received in 1870. Copy of the above letter was sent to Colonel Pelly, as per Government Resolution No. 3638, requesting him to comply with the requisition of the Chief Commissioner in Oudh^ and to explain why a supply of stones was not sent to India in 1869-70, as directed in Gov ernment Resolution No. 1785, dated 3rd June 1869. Colonel Pelly, in his reply. No. 1010-260, dated 12th September 1871, explained the cause of the non-transmission, discussing some points connected with the propagation of the date-palm by offshoots, &amp;c., and requested that the Chief Commissioner might specify what samples he desires a further supply of, that the same might be sent to him •, and further, on the 13th October 1871, he sent a bag of dates to Bombay consigned to the Secretary to Gov ernment for transmission to the Chief Commissioner in Oudh. In his reply, No. 5119, dated 7th November 1871, the Secretary to the Chief Commis sioner of Oudh wrote to the Bombay Government requesting that an expression of the Chief Commissioner's thanks be conveyed to Colonel Pelly for the great trouble taken by him in securing information about the cultivation of the date-palm, and begging that an annual supply of such sorts of seeds as reach the ' Khoormah ' stage be furnished without the pulp. He further requested a supply of 50 offshoots of the best sort, and forwarded Dr. Bonavia^s report No. 275, dated 31st October 1871, having reference to Colonel Pelly's letter No. 1010-260, dated 12th September 1871. In sendin 0 ' the above letter and enclosure to Colonel Pelly, the Bombay Govemment desired as per Resolution No. 5912, dated 7th December 1871, to send the offshoots and naked seeds to India required by the Oudh Administration. The Bombay Government- further sent, as per their Resolution No. 6355, dated 30th December 1871, the Government of India Resolution stating, «that so far as the experiment of introducing the superior varieties of the date-palm into Oudh has yet proceeded, it appears to promise ultimate success, and that it is desirable to ensure, for some years to come, a regular supply of seeds and offshoots of the better kinds in view of extending the experiment.' On the 29th of January 1872, Colonel Pelly advised the Government of Bombay his having despatched, per steam-ship Cashmere, a bag of about 104®, consisting of the under mentioned kinds of seeds from Busrah required by the Commissioner of Oudh Hallow!

The Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Oudh, in his letter No. 4246, dated 30th September 1872, to the Bombay Government, enclosed a memorandum, dated 23rd September 1872, from the Superintendent, Department of Science, Oudh, acknowledging the receipt, in good condition, of the above offshoots, and his letter No. 4481, dated 15th October 1872, conveyed to the Bombay Government the Chief Commissioner's request that, as previously promised by Colonel Pelly, at least 70, if not the whole hundred plants, might be sent to Lucknow to enable them to set on foot a nursery in view of stocking the whole province; and he further added that no more date seeds were required. Accordingly a supply of 100 date plants, as follows,— Sa'meran 24 Gantar 22 Hallowi 21 Khedrowi 26 Kabkab 1 Male plants 7 being procured, they were shipped on board the British India Steam Navigation Company's steamer Cashmere on the 14th December 1872, to the consignment of the Secretary, Bombay Government, who was advised of this despatch and requested to intimate whether a supply of 100 plants would be annually required. The Bombay Government, as per Resolution No. 797, dated 6th February 1873, sent to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, copy of a letter from Dr. Bonavia, Superintendent, Department of Science, informing him that an annual supply of 100 date-palms would be sufficient. The Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Oudh, in his letter No. 4S1, dated 29th January 1873, to the Bombay Government, stated that the date plants from the Persian Gulf had, with two exceptions, been received in good condition. The Junior Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Oudh forwarded, as per his letter No. 4187, dated 4th September 1873, to the Bombay Government Dr. E. Bonavia's report, dated 19th August 1873, on the state of the culture of the date-palm in Oudh, soliciting that date offshoots should be sent from the Persian Gulf only once a year so as to arrive in Lucknow in September or at the latest in October. The above papers were sent to Colonel Ross, the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, by the Bombay Government, as per Resolution No. 6131, dated 8th Octeber 1873, with a request to give the necessary orders for a compliance with the wishes of the Superintendent, Department of Science in Oudh, and Colonel Ross despatched 100 date plants per S.

During the period of six years the cultivation of date-palm having made considerable progress, the Personal Assistant to the Chief Commissioner of Oudh wrote in his letter No. 3261, dated 17th September 1874, to the Government of India, and forwarded a copy of Dr. E. Bonavia's report No. 389, dated 8th September 1874, on the cultivation of the Arabian date-palm in Oudh, expressing the Chief Commissioner's opinion that no further assistance was requiied, for the plants they had were sufficient for propagation, and were progressing satisfactorily.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1885-86. 19 Dr. Bonavia's return showed that the total number of Arabian date-palms— i.e., the offshoots and seedlings—alive on the 31st o£ August 1874 amounted to 5,230 in the various districts of Oudh. The greatest height which some of these plants had then attained was 9 feet, this being in the Lucknow garden j and some plants in various districts had fruitedj but for want of pollen the fruit did not come to maturity. Copy of the above papers was sent for in formation of the Resident, Persian Gulf, as per Bombay Government Resolution No. 5964, dated 14th October 1874. In March 1878 a consignment of date offshoots was despatched at the instance of Colonel Ross by Mr. Robertson, Her Majesty's Consul at Busrah, to Bombay, whence they were forwarded to Agra by the Agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company., In August 1879, the Honorary Secretary, Agri-Horticultural Society, Madras, requested Colonel Ross for a supply of date offshoots and any information on the cultivation of the date-palm. Copy of the Secretary's letter was sent to Mr. Robertson at Busrah, with a request to send about 50 offshoots direct to Madras; and in reply the Secretary was informed of the steps taken, and a memorandum of extracts from previous correspondence on the subject of the date- palm cultivation was sent to him. Mr. Robertson, in answer to Colonel Ross's letter, informed him that he himself, as also the Agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company, had received similar communications, and that the latter had replied that they would be glad to supply the Society with as many offsets as were wanted, and that, therefore, he thought it as well to leave the matter to them, their facilities for executing the commission being peculiar. Mr. Robertson further added that if the Resident still wished him to forward the plants he would be most happy to do so. Copy of this letter was sent by the Resident to the Honorary Secretary, Madras Agri-Horti cultural Society, requesting to be informed whether, under the circumstances, he still wished date offsets to be sent by Mr. Robertson. In his reply, dated I4th November 1879, the Honorary Secretary thanked the Resident for the trouble, and enclosing the Resolution of the Committee of the Society, informed him that he had asked Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. to collect and forward to him 200 date plants- The Commissioner, Central Division, India, in his report No. 2400—R., dated 1st July 1881, on experimental farms, suggested, as regards experiments in date-growing, that at least 100 well-selected young plants, male and female, should be obtained from Bushire through Colonel Ross; and the Government of Bombay, in Resolution No. 4942, dated 27th August 1881, desired the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, to obtain and send 100 well-selected date plants. Accordingly Colonel Ross, having requested Captain J. H. Newill, then the Assistant Political Agent and Consul at Busrah, to obtain the required number of plants and transmit them by mail steamer to Bombay, wrote as per his No. 97, dated 23rd September 1881, acknowledging the above Government Resolution and advising despatch of the plants; and enclosed some memoranda on the subject of date cultivation and transplantation prepared by Mr. J. C. Edwards, Assistant Resident in 1878 and 1879. Colonel Ross further sent on the 23rd February 1882 some information furnished by the Residency Agents in the Persian Gulf, regarding transplantation of offshoots of the date-palm, to the Bombay Government. On the 12th May 1884, the Secretary to the Government of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh wrote, as per his Nos. 369-1—107-7, of 1884, to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, saying that the cultivation of the Arabian date-palm had been tried in the Horticultural Gardens in Oudh, and there were large numbers of date-palms which had made such favorable progress in their growth that the experiment was regarded as a success; that as the palms were then approaching a fruiting age further information was required in regard to their cultivation, &amp;c., and protection of the fruit from insects; and he enclosed an extract from Dr. Bonavia's letter dated 16th April 1884, containing certain queries on the subject of preservation and curing of date fruit, fertilisation and transplantation of young shoots, and general method of cultivation adopted in the Persian Gulf, and requested to be furnished with information on the points required. In his reply. No. 262, dated 1st July 1884, Colonel Ross submitted a memorandum on the subject prepared by Khan Bahadur, A. R. Hakim, L.M. In acknowledging the above letter, the Chief Secretary to the Government of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh requested, as per his No. 882-1-107, dated 4th August 1884, Colonel Ross to convey the thanks of that Government to Mr. A. R. Hakim for the complete and interesting report furnished by him. On the 3rd July 1885, the Superintendent of the Mysore Government Botanical Gardens, Bangalore, wrote to Colonel Ross requesting a small consignment of the best varieties of the20 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GLLF POLITICAL date-palm offshoots and seeds for trial in that province, and adding that any assistance rendered in the matter would be much appreciated by His Highness the Maharaja s Government. Accordingly a supply of 116 date offshoots as follows, No. 18 18 18 18 16 10 10 Satara Hallowi Gantar Khedrowi Sa'meran Dyeri Baraim Zahedi Male plants was procured from Busrah and shipped on board the B. 1.

Mr. Cameran, the Superintendent, in his letter dated 28th November 1885, acknowledged the safe arrival of the date offshoots with his thanks for the trouble taken, and requesting to be supplied with date seeds. In his letter No. A.-1584, dated 20th October 1885, the Director, Department of Agri culture and Commerce, North-Western Provinces and Oudh, requested the Resident, Persian Gulf, to send him a supply of date-palm seeds of two or three varieties. In accordance with the above requisitions a small supply of the best seeds with their pulp was procured from Busrah and sent on the 14th December 1885, per S. S.

ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1885-86. Political. —At the commencement of the official year, tranquillity reigned throughout the country. In April the Sultan's Waliof Zikki suffered a reverse at the hands of Hilal-bin-Zahir near Fark) a fortlet in the possession of Hilal-bin-Zahir, the inhabitants of which place, it was said, proposed to hand over the fort to the Wali of Zikki, who had therefore marched to Fark to take it over; but was engaged by Hilal, defeated, and forced to retire on Manh. The district of Jaalan was also reported to be somewhat disturbed, and an attack was made by the Beni-bu Hassan on Sineysileh near Sur, in which one of the Beni Sinan was killed. In May, the fortress of Behla (Wali Nasir-bin-Hameid-el-Ghafri) was besieged by Sheik Salim-bin Bedr-el-Ibu in conjunction with the Yaarabeh, but being too weak to take it, they soon raised the siege. In June, news was received that an insurrection had taken place at Dhofar, which was confirmed in October by the Wali Ali-bin Suleiman together with the Arab garrison coming to Muscat; they having been expelled by the inhabitants of Dhofar, from whom, however, letters were at the same time received, in which their friendship for, and allegiance to, His Highness Sayid Turki was expressed, while stating that they had been unable to endure the oppression of his Wali. In July, it was rumoured that Sayid Abdul Aziz, the Sultan's brother, intended to attack Muscat after the Ramazan fast was over, but he was unable to collect a sufficient force for the purpose, and the intended movement collapsed. In the same month the Beni Hina were attacked by the A.wamir, with whom they were at feud, in the vicinity of Sib, and three of their number killed; they retaliated by destroying some $20,000 worth of date property belonging to the Awamir at Khoth; upon which the Awamir, assisted by the Wali of Masnaa, Ali-bin-Salim A1 Amiri, and the Wali of Barka, Saui-bin Khanis-al-Amiri, again attacked the Beni Hina, but were repulsed with a loss of 7 killed. On the news reaching Muscat,' His Highness Sayid Turki sent his son, Sayid Feysul, to Sib to enquire, into the matter; but before his arrival a truce for one year had been arranged by the Sheiks of Semael. In August, Sayids Feysul and Fahd proceeded in the S. S. Bar es Salam to Sur to endeavour to obtain payment of certain customs duty from the Jenebeh, but were unsuccessful. In the same month, a party of Mokabil raided the district of Majaz near Sohar and lifted some camels, but were promptly followed and reduced to submission by the Wali of Sohar (Hamad-bin-Nasir). In September, a serious collision occurred between the Beni Ghafir and Ibriyin in Wadi Sahtani, in which 25 of the former and 45 of the latter were killed. In November, a man was killed at Kuriyat by a party of Beni Battash,for which deed the tribe agreed to pay blood-money. In this month a serious collision occurred in the Sharkiyeh between the Mesakereh on the one side, and the Harth, Hijrieen Rejeybi and al Wahibah on the other, in which 60 or 70 men were killed. Ali-bin-Salim al Amiri was despatched by His Highness the Sultan to mediate between the parties, in which mission he was successful. In December the Political Agent (Colonel Miles) made an interesting tour of 20 days through Oman and the Dhahireh country, and was received everywhere with great courtesy and cordiality. In January 1886, His Highness Sayid Turki was informed that Her Majesty had been graciously pleased to create him a K.G.C.S.I. In the same month an attempt was made to assassinate the Minister, Sayid Said-bin-Muhammad, who was wounded in the Ishoulder by a pistol-bullet; the would be-assassin escaped, but several slaves were arrested on suspicion. The occurrence was taken advantage of by Sayid Abdul Aziz to indite a letter to the Minister, in which he endeavoured to seduce him from his allegiance to His Highness Sayid Turki. In the same month the Khoja traders of Khabureh complained of oppression at the hands of the Wali of Sohar; the matter was enquired into by the Political Agent and redress obtained. Slave Trade. —There were two seizures made during the year by Her Majesty's vessels cruising in these waters, viz., Her Majesty's S. Osprey, one dhow with 72 slaves, seized off Ras Madraka; Her Majesty's S. Ranger, a dhow with 2 slaves, captured off Sur; both of which were condemned. E. MOCKLER, Lieut.-Colonel, H. B. M.'s Political Agent and Consul, Muscat, British Political Agency and Consulate, Muscat; The 28th June 1886. ■I I22 ADMINISTRATION KEPOET OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL APPENDIX A TO PART II. NOTES OP A TOUR THROUGH OMAN AND EL-DHAHIREH, By Lieut.-Colonel S. B. Miles. The general tranquillity of the country, and other reasons, at tte close of 1885 gave me an opportunity of making a tour through the Provinces of Oman and Dhahireh which ^ not previously been able to explore, and which Lieutenants WeI sted and Whitelock, who travelled in 1835, 50 years ago, are the only Europeans who are known to have visited. I was also desirous of making the personal acquaintance of the more important Shaikhs m those parts with whom I had not hitherto come in contact during my residence at Muscat. The route I had proposed to take was through Semail and Zikki to Adam, thence across the Neid El-Dhahireh to Obri and Dhank, and then descending the Wady Howasineh, return by the Batineh Coast to Muscat. This programme was carried out, with this difterence, that I returned from Muskin by a shorter road through Rostak. _ _ . ^ . The Sultan was good enough to appoint Sayid Hamood Bm Nasir, the son of the Wali of Muttrah, as leader of the escort, and Nasir Bin Muhammad, Shaikh of the Bern Kelban, as guide and Kefeer. His Highnesses Secretary, Suliman, and Shaikh Salaam-bm- Hamid, also accompanied the party, which consisted altogether of 23 persons. We left Muscat on the 11th December, slept at Wateyah the first night and at lanja on the second, and on the 13th December, after halting at Semail for two hours, reached Seyjeh, a town of the Beni Jabir in the Wady Beni Ruweyheh. The storms and floods of March 1885 did immense damage in the Semail valley, and the people were still lamenting their houses washed down, their date trees and cattle swept away, and their crops spoilt; the river rose 24 feet, and the marks of its highest point were still visible on the banks. Some of the few surviving members of the last dynastic family, the Yaarebeh, are living in retirement at this town, Seyjeh, whither they have taken refuge from the persecutions of their successors the Al-bu-Saidis. December 14th. —I had sent to Nasir bin Muhammad, the head Shaikh of the Beni Ruweyheh, immediately on arriving here, requesting him to accompany me as far as Zikki, and soon after starting this morning we met him on the road with two other Shaikhs. He resides at Obal, a village three miles from Seyjeh, and was anxious we should pay him a visit there, but I declined from press of time. Obal is a picturesque spot; it appears like a whit 6 hill surmounted by a tower and skirted by a dense grove of date palms. Away to our left, just opposite Obal, is the Nejd of Wady Akk with its three spurs branching off to the south, forming the valleys of Semed, Andam, and Ibrah. The Wadi Beni Ruweyheh is here very narrow with high ranges on either side. About half way we reach Mezberriyeh, which is considered the Nejd or highest point of the valley, and has an altitude of 2,200 feet. From hence the road runs level or slightly descending to Zikki. Passing Wady Meteh and Wady Karoot we reached Zikki at 2 p.m ., and I put up in a Sabla outside the fort, which I did not enter this time as I had examined it thoroughly on my former visit ten years before. It was rebuilt in the early years of this century by Muhammad Nasir-el-Jabri, and having since stood several sieges is now in a very dilapidated state, but still strong. The circumstances under which Shaikh Nasir surrendered this fort to His Highness Sayid Turki about a year ago were fully reported at the time. The present Wali on behalf of the Sultan is Shaikh Muhammad bin Sinan. The town is inhabited by two rival tribes who occupy separate walled enclosures or Hujrahs, and maintain almost incessant warfare with each other. They are divided by the broad bed of the Wady Halfain, the Nizar dwelling to the south of the stream, while the Yemin Hujrah, as well as the fort, stand on the right bank at the edge of a cliff some 200 feet high. December 15th. —Having obtained fresh baggage camels I proceeded to-day to Manh, which was reached at noon. Descending the steep cliff into the Wady Halfain, we rode along the left bank for a mile until we came opposite to Zikkeyt, a small quadrangular walled village of the Beni Riyam, and then crossing the stream traversed a wide and level plain having a gentle declivity towards the south to Manh. The Wady Halfain is here a broad but shallow river, but soon loses itself in the sand, though it is said after heavy rain to reach the sea at Mahot. The bed is a highway for caravans from Oman to the Ghubbet Hashish, and is inhabited by numerous Bedouins, as water is found 4 everywhere near the surface. The frontier town of Adam is, like Zikki, occupied by two hostile tribes, and hearing here that a collision had lately occurred between them, I determined to leave half my party with the baggage at Manh and push on with the escort only, to which I here added six JenebehRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1885-86. 23 Bedouins. After a halt of two hours we started for Jzz, a village in the direction of Adam and about 5 miles from Manh, where we camped for the night. On the following day, the 16th, leaving Izz at 7-30, we rode over a level but gently descending plain, at a good pace, to Adam, which we reached at 1-30 j direction nearly due south, a little east. At half an hour we passed the Wady Kalbuh, a fine stream of water which rises above Nezwa, and after running almost parallel to Wady Halfain, falls into the Ghubbet Hashish. The plain we are crossing is quite uninhabited, and we met not a single traveller on the road. There is plenty of game, however—houbara, partridge, and sandgrouse rise up on all sides, while gazelles and hares start up occasionally from the dwarf mimosas and bunches of desert grass about. As we approach Adam two low hills rise up in front, one on each hand of the road. The one to our right is Jebel Sulakh and the other Jebel Mushmar; they are both perfectly arid, and appear to be about 800 or 1,000 feet in height. As one approaches it the appearance of Adam with the dark lines of its extensive date groves is very refreshing to the eye after the glare and monotonous aspect of the plain we had traversed : it is a true oasis in the desert. I was greeted very civilly here by all parties, and having been invited to visit the town and forts I spent the whole afternoon in seeing what was to be seen. A cousin of our leader Say id Hamood took us first to the quarter of the Al-bu-Saidis, a walled enclosure named the Jami, inhabited by about 150 families. The chief object of interest here was the house in which the Imam Ahmad, the founder of the present dynasty, was born. He was of low origin, being a camel driver like his father before him ; being a man of energy and courage, however, he rose to be Jemadar of the garrison and then Wali of Sohar. He was subsequently elected Imam by the people in gratitude for his expulsion of the Persians. Taking leave of the Al-bu-Saidis at Jami I went over to the quarters of the town occupied by their enemies, the Moharik, which are five in number, and over which I was shown successively by their Shaikh, Hamid-bin-Khamis, and by the Temimeh of the Jenebeh, Saif-bin-Hamud. There are two other quarters occupied by the Shaibani and Beni Wail tribes, making eight in all. As I visited one section after another, I was somewhat surprised and amused at the intense curiosity exhibited by the Arabs here. They not only lined each side of the road in great numbers as I walked through the date grove from one quarter to another and blocked my path to stare at me, but after I had passed them would scamper round another way to get in front again and so gain another gaze at the stranger. They were all perfectly well behaved and did not attempt to offer the slightest rudeness, but I never saw the like of their open-mouthed curiosity. There is a large fort here originally built by the Imam Ahmad and repaired by the Imam Azzan in 1869, but it is hardly cared for and weakly e-arrisoned, for in truth the Adamites are too distant from other tribes to be concerned in the usual intestinal wars of Oman, and reserve their powder and lead for each other. The population as near as I can guess numbers 4,500, composed of five tribes, the Moharik, Al-bu- Saidis, Sheyabina, Majabera, and Beni Wail, of which the most important is the Moharik. The elevation of Adam above the sea is 850 feet, being 500 feet lower than Manh and 1,300, lower than Zikki, which is '2,150. No other town of Oman lies nearly so far south as this the outlying picket, as it were, towards the great sand desert which stretches away to the Yeman and the Hejaz, and which is known here, as well as to all the Bedouins of Southern Arabia, as the Roba-el-Khali. Looking towards the south and east, neither hill nor habi tation meets the eye, the line of horizon is as unbroken as the sea; while northward in the distance rises the grand pile of Jebel Akhdar which towers up to a height of 10,000 feet. Most of the Bedouin tribes, which inhabit the border of the huge wilderness on the edge of which we are standing, contribute contingents who roam over it with their camels, but the number of these wanderers is necessarily very small, for the only water found is that left in pools in the water-courses after rainfall and some springs of brackish water welling up here and there. Animal life is not entirely absent,—the oryx, the wild ass, and two species of gazelle are found everywhere, and the ostrich is met with in the northern and western part of the desert: it does not approach Oman. The soil is said to be everywhere saltish or nitrous, 17th. —I returned to Manh during the day and encamped here in one of the gardens near the fort. Manh is rather a scattered town with a population of some 2,01)0 souls of mixed tribes. It has been well described by Wellsted, who cannot suppress a cry of admi ration at the extent and luxuriance of the diversified cultivation around. He says ' Minna differs from the other towns in having its cultivation in the open fields. As we crossed these, with lofty almond, citron, and orange trees, yielding a delicious fragrance on either hand, exclamations of astonishment and admiration burst from us. Is this Arabia ? We said, this is the country we have looked on heretofore as a desert ? Verdant fields of grain and sugar-cane stretching along for miles are before us; streams of water flowing in all directions intersect our path, and the happy and contented appearance of the peasants agreeably helps to fill up the smiling picture.' D 124 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL Manh did not wear quite so fair a dress at the time of my yjsrt, but the d.stnet :s undoubtedly a well -watered and fertile one. All the springs here as they are at Adam and Bahilah, and indeed at most places in Oman proper, are hot; the temperature varymg from 102 to 112 degrees Fahrenheit. There is no Wall here on t«hal£ ot the Su tan, e leading man and dispenser of justiee is the Metowwa Muhammad-bin-Mesud, who is reputed to be the most learned man in Oman. im —I decided to move on to Bahilah to-day, because though it would have saved us a day's journey to visit Nezwa first, as my Arab companions did not fail to represent to me I was desirous ot exploring the country between Manh and Bahila. We left at 8 a.m . and at 9 reached Karsha, a small hamlet of seventy houses. At 9-30 we crossed the W. Kalbuh, and at 10-45 halted for coffee at Timsa, a picturesque village under a hill with a large date grove. An hour later we came toKhamaili, a mystic pool of water_ famed throughout Oman as the source of all magic and sorcery. The fable is that a man lies im prisoned by enchantment deep down under the water, which has become red from his blood. Any one venturing to drink it becomes enchanted immediately and falls under the magi cian's spell. I drank some nevertheless and found_ it very sweet and good. After along ride over a stony plain covered with low black hills we came to Fut, a small hamlet to our leftj and soon after the singularly situated town of Bahilah comes into sight. The first view presents a long white wall with bastions at intervals enclosing a large extent of cultivated ground with a huge white fort and lofty tower standing on an eminence in the centre, picturesquely overlooking and commanding the town beneath. Its appearance indeed is more striking than that of any other town I have seen in Oman. From the time we had been sighted on the road, the garrison had continued to fire guns at intervals from the walls as we approached, and as we drew nearer the Shaikh with a party of horsemen, and followed by an immense concourse of people, issued from the gate and rode down the bed of the Wady to meet us. We then halted while the Shaikh and his followers exhibited their skill in horsemanship, galloping round in a circle and firing off their matchlocks at full speed, running races with each other, &amp;e. After this was over we formed procession and rode slowly on through the gate into the town, where we were lodged in a pleasant house and garden. After receiving a visit from Shaikh Nasir-bin-Hameyed I occupied the rest of the day in examining the space within the walls and the town. On the following morning I paid a visit to the Shaikh at his fort, where he received me very courteously. He is a heavy-featured, unprepossessing looking young man of 22, with much decision of character and evidently complete master of the position. He has obtained some notoriety lately by his murder of his two elder brothers, Barghash and B/ashid, the circumstances of which have been reported. I learned here that Shaikh Barghash had long suspected Nasirof sinister designs against him and had prohibited his entering the fort. Nasir, however, managed to persuade Rashid to join in a plot for killing Barghash, and having by the help of three slaves concealed himself one night in Barghash's apartments, he shot the latter dead while asleep. Nasir then proclaimed Rashid Shaikh of the tribe, in place of Barghash; but Rashid wag incompetent and soon allowed all matters to fall into the hands of Nasir, who, some months later, becoming tired of the situation, quietly shot his brother through the back one day while they were riding out to Yabrin together. No disturbance ensued, and Shaikh Nasir has since re tained possession, but, though undisputed ruler of Bahilah and nominal Wali on behalf of the Sultan, he has not yet been recognised as Temimeh of the Beni Ghafir in place of Barghash. The fort is a very large building with two towers, one of which is named the ' Burj-el-Rih/' is very lofty, and commands a'splendid view of the whole valley. Our guide. Shaikh Nasir-el- Kelbani, who is the Wazir of Bahilah, told me that the fort was named Hisn Tamah from the Nabhani who built it. I was allowed to photograph the fort from different positions. The upper part, or Alaya, of Bahilah is chiefly occupied by the Beni Ghafir; the lower town, or Sifala, being inhabited by the Beni Shekeyl, Ibriyeen, Beni Ghafir, and others. The whole town is divided into 20 separate enclosed haras or quarters, and contains a population of 6,000 souls. The outer wall embracing the town and cultivation is an irregular parallelogram cover ing an area of about two square miles. I observed no cultivation outside of this wall, which is traditioned to have been built by a woman named Gheitha 600 years ago. Inside were fields of wheat, jowari, barley, lucerne, sugar-cane and cotton, besides extensive date groves and orchards of other fruit. The manufactures here are brown cotton cloth, loongies, goatsMiair cloaks, matting, and hulwa. Bahilah is believed to be a very ancient town, and it was the capital of Oman under the Nebhani dynasty in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. It is the ' Barlerof Wellsted, who has somewhat misplaced it on his map. The people here have goodRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1885-86. 25 houses and seem well off and contented; they were still lamenting, however, the damage done in the great storm of March 1885, when the river rose many feet and carried off many houses and date trees. I was much pleased with the gereral reception I met with here and was glad to have seen so interesting a place. The elevation of Bahilah is 1,550 feet. In the afternoon, accompanied by Shaik Nasir-bin-Hamid, who insisted upon showing me every attention in his power, I started for Yabrin, which is four miles distant, and which was reached before sunset. The Shaikh and his followers amused themselves by galloping about and running races with each other all the way. Yabrin is merely a small fort, garrisoned by six Arabs, without any dependent township, and there is no settled population here. Formerly it was of more importance, and in the days of the Imam Belarab bin Sultan El Yaareby, who built the fort about the year 1690 A. D., it was the capital of Oman. As the sun set here it revealed in all its glory and distinctness of outline the huge mountain called Jebel-el-Kon which lies to the westward of Bahilah and forms the geographical boundary between the Pro vinces of Oman and Dhahireh. It is quite detached from the Jebel Akhdar range, and appears to have a height of 6,000 or 7,000 feet. The chief road from Bahilah to Dhahireh runs to the south of this mountain and is called by some the ' Neid-el-Makharim,' by others the ' Nejd-el- Dhahireh.^ The northern road is steeper and more difficult, and is known as the ' Nejd-el- Barak.' After consulting with the Arabs I resolved after leaving Nezwa to cross over to Dhahireh by the northern pass, and as it turned out it was fortunate I did so. 20th. —We despatched a Kossid early to give notice to Shaikh Hilal at Nezwa of our ap proach, and started about 8 a.m .; we passed a hamlet in the Wadi Masalla, reached Tanoof at 2, and at 3-30 came to the outskirts of Nezwa. As we passed the outlying watch towers commanding the various approaches, the men therein fired their matchlocks, and as we came nearer, the fort took up the firing with its big guns. Descending into the bed of the 'Wadi Kalbuh, we rode through a dense crowd of people until we met Shaikh Hilal-bin-Zahir, who re. ceived us very civilly and conducted us to a subla near the gate. I was then taken to the resi dence allotted to me, and an hour later was visited by Shaikh Hilal, who informed me that the house I was in belonged to a brother of Sayid Nasir-bin-Ali, who was the Governor of Muscat, and was murdered in his house there during the time of Sir B. Frere's visit in 1873. Shaikh Hilal is a dignified and powerfully built man for an Arab, with a broad, expressive countenance, showing much firmness and intelligence. He is now one of the most prominent men in Oman; his artful diplomacy in turning every move in the intrigue against the late Wali a few years-ago to his own advantage and in gaining possession of, first, the fort, and then the government, of Nezwa, drew general attention to him, and he is now looked on as second only to Saleh-bin-Ali himself as a leader. He gave me the idea of being the same sort of man that the Imam Ahmed bin Said was—able, resolute, and capable of any villainy to compass the end he had in view. 21st. —Shaikh Hilal paid me an early visit, and we had a long geographical talk, during which he gave me an account of the watersheds of the country. He said very little cotton was grown at Nezwa and no cloth made whatever, but that indigo was largely cultivated and used to dye American cloth brought from Muscat. Nezwa was famous for its copper and brass work. After breakfast I took a walk through the town and environs, and was surprised at the prosperity and populousness of the place. Nearly all the tribes of the country seem to be represented here, the predominating ones being the Beni K-iyam, who occupy Alaya&gt; and the Beni Hinah, who have been introduced extensively by Shaikh Hilal since he assumed power here. Sifala has six haras, viz., —'Akr,' in which stands the fort and which has a fine gate to its enclosure; 'Saal,' unwalled; 'Khorasin/' walled and contiguous to ' Akr/'' ' Khorasitin,' ' Haret-el-wady,' and another. The two Wadies ' Kalbuh' and ' Abyad ' divide the town and join near the fort by the market. Abyad has a more abundant supply of water than Kalbuh, and consequently supplies more felejes. The fort consists of two parts, the ' Kila ' and the ' Hisn/-' The latter is a quadrangular enclosure, at one corner of which stands the Kila, a huge circular tower 80 feet high, and considered by the Arabs to be by far the strongest fort in Oman. I did not enter it, but Wellsted says that three-fourths of the height, which he gives at 150 feet, are filled up solid with earth and stones, and that the narrow passage inside, leading up from the doorway and forming the only entrance, has seven iron doors to it. Leaving Nezwa at 4-30 I marched to Tanuf, a distance of 8 miles, the same evening, having promised Shaikh Suliman bin Saif bin Suliman-el-Riyami, who had intercepted me on the road the day before, to spend a night in his town. It is a compact and substantial-looking place, fortified with a wall, on which are mounted two guns, and there is a large date grove in the ravine at the back. This ravine is the Wady Hyin, and up it lies the road from Nezwa to Rostak known as the 'Tareek-el- Shas.'ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL 22nd. —Having procured fresh baggage camels we rode to-day m the direction of the Akbat-el-Barak, by which we intended to cross over to Dhahireh. Our road led over a stony plain crossed by numerous water-courses and very barren. We passed several villages,- Homreh, Ghumriyer, and Belad Sait, &amp;c.,-the inhabitants of which were in a very excited state and usually fired at us on our approach, but they quieted down very easily always when Shaikh Nasir Kelbani had explained who we were. The cause of the panic was that a troop of Jenebeh had ridden by in the night; we could see the footprints of their camels; and as thev are at feud with the Beni Hinah, who occupy these villages and are the predominant tribe in these parts, it was expected that the Jenebeh were on the war-path, and that their obiect was to raid the district. We heard to-day also that a band of seventy mounted marauders comino- from Dhahireh to raid the outskirts of Manh, had crossed the Nejd-el- Makharim and camped near Yabrin the day we had left it, and our party congratulated themselves that we had not gone by that road. We now enter the Wady Ghol, which unites with the Wady Shams lower down to form the Wady Bahilah, and ascend its broad bed, here tolerably well wooded and inhabited by shepherds, for two hours, until we reach a hamlet called Mithar, near which we halt and bivouac for the night at an elevation of 2,600 feet. 2Srd. The crossing of the pass to-day took us nine hours, and the camels were rather tired when we reached our destination in the Wady Ain at 4 p.m . Continuing to ascend the Wady Ghol, which becomes gradually rougher and steeper, we reach the summit about 11 a.m ., and find that the barometer indicates 3,700 feet. From this point we look down a small valley running south, called the Wady Seifam, and then commence to descend the other side of the Akbat-el-Barak, the Jebel-el-Kor here towering 3,000 feet above us. After crossing a small stretch of level ground, the road falls into the Wady Ein, a large and seemingly important valley, with a running stream trending westwards. At 2 p.m . we arrive at Hail, a village of the Beni Hinah, under a jagged, square, perpendicular cliff called Jebel Misht, or Mount Comb. Our approach threw the villagers at El Bin into some trepidation, and they fired a volley at us, one of our camels having his leg grazed by a bullet. They afterwards apologised and explained that they were not accustomed to see so large a party enter their valley. It appears to be the fashion at the larger towns for the soldiers to salute distinguished strangers with blank cartridge; at the smaller and more defenceless places, they sometimes salute you with bullets, but Arabs are so skilful at missing with their quaint matchlocks, that there is very rarely any harm done. The people here gave me the names of several hamlets existing in the ravines and valleys formed by the spurs of Jebel-el-Kor, viz., —' Shedait,' ' Nadan,' ' Sint,' Sunt,' &amp;c. Early the next morning we continued our journey down the Wady Bin for some way, and then turned off to the right to Bat, a village of the Beni Kelban, with two towers and four hundred inhabitants, where we halted for an hour; distance about 12 miles. We then proceeded on to Wahaireh, at which place the watchmen maintained a desultory fire on us for some time until we expostulated, and mutual explanations resulted in a treaty of peace • the people then came out in procession to welcome us and insisted on our staying with them for the night, which we agreed to do, and they treated us very hospitably. There is a good stream of water here, and the cultivation around includes wheat, indigo, sugar-cane, jowaree, plantains, mangoes, lucerne, dates, limes, &amp;c., &amp;c. -Left Wahaireh early and rode to Dereez, a town 8 miles farther on, where the Shaikh and his people came out in a very friendly way to greet us; those on horseback running races with each other, while the others stood around chanting their war songs. There is a small tumble down fort here with two guns; population about 1,200, all Beni Ghafir. After a short halt I left Dereez and rode on to visit the fort of Einein, a famous bone of contention in this country for many years past. It is merely a large house flanked by two towers, and did not appear to me a strong place. There is a large date grove near, watered by three felejes which are commanded by the fort; but there are no inhabitants. After Einein we passed Iraki, a village of the Ibriyeen, and then Gbabbi formerly a large town, now in ruins, having been destroyed by the Beni Ali in local wars some ten years ago. At 2 p.m . we reached Obri, and.soon after one of the camel- men came in and complained of having been looted by robbers on the road. He had lagged behind and had been cut off by two scamps who had taken his matchlock and dagger and a bundle of clothes belonging to my servant, but had not touched the photo graphic kit and other baggage on the camel. The camelman was a native of this place and had imagined the thieves would not molest him, but they are no respecters of persons. On enquiry it turned out that the two robbers were part of the band of seventy who had gone on a marauding expedition to Oman as mentioned above. They had attempted to plunder aRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1885-86. 27 village there, but had been attacked by the people, and in the scuffle two robbers and three villagers had been slain. The band had just returned and were scattering to their homes, and the two scamps after overhauling our camel had decamped to a distant village. The Sheikh here was unable to do anything in the matter, and so I got no redress. Obri has by far the largest and most frequented market in El-Dhahireh, and it is besides the thieves' bazar of the province, where all the loot collected in Oman and the Betinah is brought and sold by auction. There are 62 shops in the bazar displaying all the commodities usually required by Arabs, and I noticed goldsmiths, blacksmiths, carpenters, and other tradesmen in it. The Sheikh Muha- mad-bin-Abdulla-el-Yakeebi was very friendly and agreeable and accompanied me all over the town; he was very particular in showing me the J ami mosque, which the inhabitants are very proud of, as it is one of the largest and best in Oman. He told me Obri was a famous place for fruit, and that limes, mangoes, dates, peaches, apricots, figs, &amp;c., were largely exported. There is a small fort here with a high tower, but I did not go over it. Obri was visited by Wellsted and Whitelock of the Indian Navy in March 1836. They were here two days ap. parently, and the spot where their tent was pitched was pointed out to me. Their visit was badly timed, as the Wahabees were then marching through, and the two officers were hissed and stoned out of the town and compelled to return to the coast. There are 16 haras or quarters in the town, and the population is about 3,000, composed of many different tribes- The elevation is 1,180 feet. On the 26th, riding due north for 26 miles, we reached Dhank at 4 p.m . After cross ing the Obri range, which has an average height of 400 feet, we traversed a level plain all the way, with low hills away to the right, stretching up to the high range known as the Hajar* To the left or westwards there are several villages, but no sign of a hill breaks the level line of the horizon. It rained heavily to-day, and the air was bitterly cold, so by the time we reached Mazun, a Belooch town 18 miles from Obri, we were all shivering. The people at Dhank were very civil and well behaved, but not demonstrative; they said they had not seen a European here before. The number of souls here is about 4,000, composed of four tribes—the Naeem,' ' Washasha,' ' Azeez, ' and ' Al-boo-shamis.' They make cloth here. The Wady Dhank and the Wady Boo Karba both join the Wady Safa, a large water-course in the ramool or desert, running to Abuthabi almost parallel with the Wady Ein; the ' Jebel Okdat ' of Wellsted is purely mythical; there is no hill range in that direction whatever, except Hafeet, near El-Beraimi. 27tJi. Lucerne grass not being grown at Dhank, our camels had nothing for supper last night but dates and barley. Starting at 8, we wind up the narrow stony bed of the Wady Dhank until we emerge from the gap in the low hills through which it flows, when it rapidly widens out to a breadth of half a mile with a fine stream of water in the middle. The banks are here about 100 feet high, and it is on this expanse that the famous battle of Dhank was fought between Sayid Turki and Sayid Azzan-bin-Kais in 1869, in which Sayid Azzan was completely routed with a loss of 300 killed. His force consisted of 4,000 men and a field- piece, but Sayid Turki's force, though numerically very inferior, was more skilfully handled and sustained but slight loss in the engagement. Sayid Azzan never recovered the prestige he lost in this contest. After four miles we come to the village of Doot, and seven miles farther is Fida, with a very long though narrow fringe of date-palms along the Wady. Both these places belong to the Beni Zeed. Five miles further is Yenkal, which I was unable to visit, as our road at Fida branched off to the right and led us across a barren plain to Aridh, where we were to halt for the night. This place, like Makiniyat, belongs to our guide, Sheikh Nasir -el-Kelbani, but the people are a mixture from the Beni Shekeyl, Omar,and Kelbani tribes. There is a small tower here but no fort. 28th. We left Aridh at 7-30 and reached Muskin at 12, the ground rising gradually Muskin is in the Wady El-Kebeer and belongs to the Beni Kelban. Its elevation is 2,750 feet. The Hajar range, like the Jebel Akhdar, slopes gradually to the desert on the western side, but on its seaward or eastern face falls abruptly and presents a precipitous aspect. From noon to dark we continue to descend the eastern face of this range, winding down in a S. E. direction among narrow ravines and steep declivities until we reach Mahbeh, a small hamlet in the Wady Bani Ghafir, where we camp for the night. To-day the high peak of Jebel Shoum was seen by me for the first time. 29th, For some hours we descend the Wady Beni Ghafir until we came to Dahas, a walled town with a fort in the centre on an eminence. Farther on we came to the Wady Sahtan of the Beni Ghafir, who have recently wrested possession of it from the Ibriyeen, and at 4 p.m . reach Rostak, where we are hospitably received by Syed Hamad bin-el-Imam in the28 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL absence of Sayid Ibrahim -bin-Kais, who had gone to Hazam. We sat down at Sayid Hamad's house to rest ourselves, and while there up came Sayid Saud, the second son of the late Imam Azzan, a bright, intelligent youth of 18, his face beaming with smiles to find so strange a party in his out-of-the-way, quiet old town. They were all surprised to see us here, as Sayid Hamad said they imagined I was still on the other side of Jebel Akhdar. Sayid Saud lives with his uncle Ibrahim in the fort, a dilapidated mediaeval castle, said to be of pre-Islamitic days and very ancient. Rostak is the second largest town in Oman, Semail being the first; there are 15 villages in fief to Rostak, and the population including these is 14,000. There is a good bazar of eighty shops here. The upper part of the valley in which Rostak is situated is called Wady Auf, the lower part is Wady Farah. Its elevation is 800 feet. On the 30th we rode down past the towns of Mansur and Jemmeh to Burka, 45 miles and the next day rode in along the coast to Muscat.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1885-86. 29 PART III. REPORT ON THE TRADE OF THE PERSIAN GULF FOR THE YEAR 1885. Exports. The rainfall in Southern Persia during the cultivating season of 1881-85 was unprece- dentedly large, amounting to 29 inches. After great hopes in the earlier months of a large harvest, the excessive rainfall caused partial failure of crops of wheat and barley by rust. Exportation of grain was conse quently prohibited by the Persian Government, and on this occasion very properly. The price of bread rose to almost famine prices in Shiraz, and much distress prevailed there. This was alleged, and is generally believed, to be owing not so much to actual scarcity of grain, as to large quantities being stored up by influential officials as a speculation. Some wheat was certainly imported into Persia from India; but the quantity was inconsiderable, and it was thought that had the stores referred to been freely sold, any importation would have been unnecessary. Distress in tire interior from dearness of food naturally depreciated piece-goods, &amp;c., and importers of Manchester goods sustained heavy losses; and trade generally throughout South Persia has been much injured and depressed. Whether it will recover depends greatly on the harvest of 1886, the prospects of which are at present (March) favorable. Owing to the conflicting interests of the Custom House and the governing authorities^ much difficulty is experienced in preventing levy of export duty twice over on grain purchased for British merchants at Bunder B.ig and Dilam and brought to Bushire. Refunds have oeen obtained in most cases, but the evil is not wholly removed. The opium crop was fairly good, and at the opening season was in good demand, but owing to a decline in the China market, the demand up- Opmm and Tobacco. country fell away, and the remainder of the crop commands lower prices fqr the London market. Quantity of Persian opium of 1885 is somewhat inferior to that of 1884. Tobacco was exported in fair quantities. Imports. The year 1885 was very unfavorable to importers in Southern Persia. Could they have foreseen the course of events, their operations would have Manchester goods, greatly restricted and heavy losses avoided; as it was, the quantity of goods imported was as large as the previous year. For at the beginning of the vear there was a good demand for Manchester goods, and Persian merchants contracted freely with importing houses at Bushire for forward delivery. Later in the year the rise in the price of bread caused a corresponding fall in Manchester goods, and these have been selling at a loss to importers. The market being thus overstocked, there will probably be a great decrease in this trade in 1886. A good deal, however, depends on the result of the wheat harvest. Another source of loss to importers was the steady decline in the value of silver ; those who speculated on a rally of the rupee must have suffered. At present the pound sterling equals 34 krans against 27 krans a few years back. The decline in value of copper in the home market induced many native dealers to speculate in that article, which, however, fell in Persia also, and Coi)per ' has never been known to be cheaper than at present. The once brisk trade with Java in sugar finally ceased in 1885, being supplanted by Mauritius and beet sugar manufactured in Europe. The French sugar was backed by bounties, but is now suffering from competition of German loaf-sugar manufactured chiefly in Itzhac in Holstein. This sugar is being sold in Persia 5 or 6 per cent, cheaper than French sugar, whilst it is equally valued. It is to be remarked that the importation of French sugar is increasing at Bunder Abbass, and a Russian firm of Marseilles has established an agency there. The attempt to work the naptha springs at Daliki mentioned Resources. re p 0r ^ abandoned.

The principal falling off in the Exports is in that of dates owing to the American market having been over-stocked the previous year, and I think also possibly to competition by the Busrah market in the supply of dates suitable for American consumption. The Imports were naturally affected by this falling off in the date market, and the failures in 1883 of several large houses in Bombay and Zanzibar, with which Muscat firms had business connec tions, have also, I am given to understand, not yet been got over. The Muscat customs were farmed for the past year by a banian merchant for 1| 110,000 (one lakh and ten thousand dollars). E. Mockler, Lieutenant-Colonel, H. B.

In paragraph 42 of an interesting paper by Captain (now Major) Durand on the pearl fisheries of the Persian Gulf {vide Appendix A, Part II, of the Persian Gulf Administration Report for the year 1877-78), he says : ' After a vain attempt of several days, I have had to give up all attempts to understand these fluctuations of every sort both of weights, coins, and value of pearls.' The subject certainly does, on first enquiry into it, appear to be a very intricate one, but it is not really so, and from questions put to me on various occasions as to the manner in which pearls are bought and sold in the Persian Gulf, and the way in which their value is calculated, I am led to believe that some further information than that extant regarding it may be acceptable. 2. One of the first things to be understood in connection with the subject is the meaning of the term ' chao, ' which Major Durand evidently supposed to be a weight equal to ^ of a ' miskal ' In paragraph 41 of his paper, it is stated that ' the pearls are bought at so much per ' chao ' down to a certain size from the divers when they are sold at so much per miskal there are 330 a chao 'in a «miskal/'and an Arab' chao 'is equal to four Hindustani 'chao.' In paragraph 38, the approximate value per Bahrein ' cbao' of various classes of pearls is given. In the Table A at the end of Major Durand's paper, the sizes of the holes in a nest of 24 sieves, shown to him, which are used to separate pearls of one size from those of another, are very carefully given, and also two tables of weights, as follows Arab scale {for unpiclced pearls) — 100 dukra=l chao = 4 Bombay chaos. 330 chao=l miskal = 2 Bombay miskals. 66habbe = l miskal=6 grains (English). Bomhay scale— 100 mezoor=l dukra. 100 dukra=lchao. 24 ratis = l miskal =6 grains. It will be afterwards seen that these scales are somewhat mixed. It will be also seen in the table referred to, that pearls of the size of from 8 to 10 pearls to a ' miskal' are supposed to be able or just unable to pass through the largest-size sieve, and that as it is stated in the scale of weights given in the same table that there are 330 ' chao ' in a ' miskal,' each pearl weighing ^ of a ' miskal' is therefore supposed to equal 41 j ' chao,' and each pearl weighing of a miskal to equal 33 C( chao ' [vide column 6 of the Table). It is quite clear from this that, as above noted, the 'chao' was supposed to be a sub-division of the ' miskal ' viz. g-l-Q- of a ' miskal.' 3. Such, however, is not the case ; it is true that a single pearl weighing one ' miskal' would be 330 ' chao ' value, but 330 pearls (all of the same size) weighing altogether one ' miskal' would altogether amount to one ' chao ' value only, and a single pearl weighing f of a ' miskal' would be roughly 5| ' chao ' value only ; and a pearl weighing of a ' miskal' would be 3 T 3 o u chao ' value only. This I will now endeavour to explain. 4. In the purchase and sale of pearls in the Persian Gulf and India, an abstract measure which is a multiple of the value of the quality of a pearl (or parcel of pearls) having a fixed ratio to the weight of the pearl is much employed; it is called a ' chao,' and may perhaps be translated in English by the word ' Caret.' The value or fineness of the ' chao ' or ' caret' of a pearl (or parcel or pearls) depends upon its (their average) shape, colour, brilliancy, specific gravity {viz., weight for size, which differs much), and also in very large pearls by size inde pendent of mere weight. The value of a 'chao'may vary from 2 annas to E1,000, ac cording to the quality of the pearl under computation and the standard of weight from which the ' chao ' is calculated. The following are the Indian sub-divisions of the ' chao ' (a measure of value having a ratio to weight) :— 16 visvasee=l badam. 256 ,, =16 » =1 dokra. 25,600 ,, =1,600 „ =100 „ =1 chao.i 'co RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1885-86. The Arab sub-divisions of the ' ehao ' are as follows : 100 mezoor= 1 dokra. IO j OOO ,, = 100 „ =1 chao. The following are the nominal sub-divisions of an Indian miskal (a pure weight convert ible into a chao '):— 6 j dokra= 1 anna. 25 = 4 „ = 1 dan. 100 „ = 16 „ =4 }) —I rati. 2400 „ =384 ,, =96,, =24 „ = 1 miskal or tank. The nominal sub-divisions of an Arab Surati miskal (a pure weight convertible into ' chao') are as follows 66 habbah=l miskal. The nominal sub-divisions of an Arab mashad miskal (a pure weight convertible into &lt;' tuman ') are as follows ;— 20 danik = l mashad miskal. The sub-divisions of the ' tuman' (a measure of value having a ratio to size and weight) are as follows :— 100 Mahomedi=l tuman. Note. —The ' tuman ' is to the mashad miskal what the ' chao ' is to the Indian or other Arab miskals,— i.e., it is a measure of the value of the average quality of a parcel of pearls. The use of the mashad miskal and ' tuman ' will hereafter be explained. It will be seen presently that the nominal ratios of the various weights to each other are purely nominal, but I think it best now to show the mode of calculating the ' chao ' of a pearl (or parcel of pearls) from its (or their) weights, 5. The Indian method (simplified) of finding the number of ' chao ' in a pearl is to mul tiply the square of the weight in ratis (the unit) of the pearl by (if the total ' chao ' of a parcel of pearls (all of the same size) be required, the square of the number of ratis weight of the parcel multiplied by must be divided by the number of pearls in the parcel, and if the 'chao' of one pearl of such parcel be required, the 'chao ' of the whole parcel must also be divided by the number of pearls in the parcel). Example I.—Supposing we have a single pearl weighing one Indian miskal =24 ratis (nominally), the sum is as follows :— (¥)' X M = ^ X M = 330 chao. Example II.—If we have a single pearl weighing -S ratis=| miskal (nominally), the sum is as follows :— (f) 2 X|~|=i'X|-|=5 chao, 15 dokras, 10 badams. Example III.—If we have a pearl weighing (nominally) i miskal = (nominally) 6 ratis, the sum is as follows ;— (f ) 2 X M =: X g-f = 20 chao, 62 dokras, 8 badams. Example IV.—If we have a parcel of 330 pearls (all of the same size) weighing one miskal (=24 ratis), the sum is as follows :— / 2 4 \2 w 55 . 3 3_0 — 5 7 6 v JL5. v —i— — 1 'nVmr*' Vi ) X ge — — i X96X330 — 1 cnao. From the above it will be seen that of two pearls of precisely the same quality, e.g., say of quality worth R25 per ' chao,' that weighing one miskal= (nominally) 24 ratis would be worth R8,250, while that weighing only 3 ratis=norainally i miskal would be worth only El 28-14-6, and a parcel of 330 pearls (all of one size) weighing one miskal would be worth only R25 for the whole parcel, and one of the pearls of such parcel be worth only 1 anna 2 pies. 6. The Arab method (simplified) of finding the number of a chaos' in a pearl is to multi ply the square of the weight in habhahs (the unit) of the pearl by , the result being in « dokras,' viz., hundredths of a chao,' and then to add to the result so obtained, as a correc tion, the hundredth part of the said result, so as to bring it up to the proportion of 330 ' chao in a pearl weighing one miskal. p 1112 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL E xample I. —Supposing we have a single pearl weighing one Arab miskal= (nominally) p6 habbahs, the sum is as follows :— Cbao.

It will be observed, from the examples given, that the number of ' chao ' in a pearl works out almost exactly the same by both the Indian and Arab methods of calculating it from their respective standards of weight of the same denomination, or from equivalent sub-divisions of their respective miskals. 7. With the dealers in pearls in the Persian Gulf four different miskals (convertible into ' chao ') are in use. The Indian weights are mostly used by the Indian dealers in transactions between themselves, or to calculate, for their private information, what will be a remunerative price to pay here for a pearl or parcel of pearls intended by them for the Indian market, and for which, after they have determined this to their own satisfaction, they will negotiate under the Arab weights. Some dealers are conversant with only one or two of the standards of weight and will do business with them only, others will trade with any standard of weight preferred by the party with whom they desire to deal. The Bombay and Katr (Suratee) miskals (convertible into ' chao 3&gt; ) are (in Muscat) those in most common use. The following are the four miskal weights alluded to :— Poona miskal = 68f grains (English). Bombay Basaree do. = about 74 do, do. Bahrein Suratee do. — about 150 do. do. Katr Suratee do. = about 160 do. do. The Poona and Bombay weights are made of agate, the Arab weights of brass. In a full set of Indian weights there are the following :— 1 five miskal weight 2 two do. do. 1 one do. do. 1 half do. do. 1 quarter do. do. 1 three rati do. 1 two do. do. 1 one do. do. For the half rati two large grains of wheat are ordinarily used. For the quarter rati one do. do.

In the tables of weights given in paragraph 4 it is stated thas 24 ratis, &amp;C., &amp;C., or 66 habbahs or 20 daniks = 1 miskal (Indian) Arab Suratee and mashad miskals respectively, but this will be found to be true of the sub-divisional and multiple weights of none of them, not as far as very careful weighing shows, of even those of the Poona weights, which are generally considered to be substantially correct according to their nominal equivalent values- For if we possessed a sufficient stock of Bombay 1 rati weights, and of Bahrein and Katr 1 habbah weights, and of Bahrein and Katr mashad 1 danik weights to weigh against their respective I miskal weights, we^should find that about 16 (not 24) Bombay ratis, also about 45 (not 66) Bahrein habbahs, also about 35 (not 66) Katr habbahs, also about 15 (not 20) Bahrein or Katr mashad daniks = 1 miskal of their respective standards.

From the above it will be seen that the actual weights used do not stand to the miskal, or to each other, in the proportion they are nominally supposed to do, and as the (i chao ' or value measure of the quality of a pearl is calculated from its nominal weight, one of the secrets of profitable pearl-dealing is to know which, and to be able to use without hesitation, when weighing pearls which are being bargained for, those weights which will give the most profitable results when converted into ' chao,' viz., to buy with the highest and sell with the lowest possible weights. 1* or instance, it will be most profitable to the buyer to use, as much as he may be allowed, the smaller denominational weights of the Bombay miskal; also the 1, 2 habbah, | danik and one miskal weights when using the Katr Suratee weights. For, supposing we have a pearl weighing 74 English grains and its weight by the Katr standard be required, it would be weighed by the i miska 1 weight = 16^ habbahs, and the 10 habbah weight and three grains of wheat = total 27i habbahs = about 74 grains English (by custom the largest denominational weights practicable should be used in a decreasing series until the scales balance). But if the buyer would permit the seller to do so, the latter might weigh the same pearl against the | miskal weight = 33 habbahs, and put into the scale with the pearl a 1 habbah weight and 1 grain of wheat = total 31| habbah = about 74 English grains; or if the seller would permit the buyer to do so, the latter might weigh against it 15 one habbah weights and 2 grains of wheat = total 15i habbahs = about 74 grains English. 9. In Major Durand's paper he has stated that one Bahrein fC chao , -' = four Hindustani chao, this means that the number of (&lt; chao ' in the same pearl are four times more, when calculated from its nominal weight according to the Bombay weights, and that therefore each Bahrein &lt; chao' requires a four times greater value to-be assigned to it than that at which a om ay c ao foi the same quality of pearl, is quoted. The approximate relative values(mi RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1885-86. 115 o£ tliechaoof the several miskals to each other at the present time, taking R25 as the value of one Bombay ' chao ' is commonly stated as follows :— R 1 Katr Chao = 125 1 Bahrein „ = 100 1 Bombay „ = 25 1 Poona „ = 22^ These relative values of the several ' chao ' may perhaps be nearly the true average pro portion for pearls of all weights converted into the equivalent nominal weights of the respective standards, but I think that the proportionate value which ought to be assigned to the Arab ^chao' should be somewhat greater. For, taking, e.g., a pearl weighing 74 grains English =one Bombay miskal =330 chao at R25 per a chao ■' = B8,250 for the pearl. The same pearl (as shown in the preceding paragraph) weighed by Katr weights =27i habbah =56 chao 24 dokra 90 mezoor at R125 per 'chao ' =R7,031; and if the usual stated proportion (which is really true if certain weights are used) of 26 habbah = one Bombay miskal is taken, then the same pearl = only S 6,400, from which it will be seen that if the Indian merchant feels sure that he can sell the pearl he is bargaining for, at R25 per Bombay ' chao,' he will be very safe in paying at the above relative prices per ' chao,' calculated from the Arab weights for such pearl. {Note, —Pearls of the value of fi25 per Bombay ' chao' are of very fine quality.) 10. It has been before mentioned that brass sieves with holes bored in them of various sizes, the holes in each sieve being of the same size in that particular sieve, are used to separate the pearls into parcels of the same sized pearls in each separate parcel. Each pearl merchant usually possesses a nest of such sieves, and a nest generally consists of 24 sieves, the holes in the sieves of one nest, however, do not always correspond in size with the holes in the sieves of another nest, but besides these sieves each pearl dealer has three others, the holes of each of which are supposed to be of the same size as those in every other dealer's set of three, and it is through the medium of these three sieves that the largest portion of the pearls fished up are bought direct from the master of a boat which has made a haul, into whose charge all the pearls fished up are given by the divers for disposal. Pearls just unable to pass through the holes of the largest of these three sieves are called ' Has/' those just unable to pass through the second sieve are called ' Batin,' and those which come into or pass through the third sieve are called ' Dzel.' The ' Has,' ' Batin,'' and ' Dzel' of a haul are, when put into the market by the master of a pearl-fishing boat, inseparable as articles for sale. They are sold, in the lump, by the mashad miskal, and its sub-divisions (daniks), at the current market rate of the 'tuman' {vide para. 4). For instance, if the master of a pearl-fishing boat has a parcel of pearls of all sizes and qualities, he will first take out all the pearls above the size of 'Has' which he will sell by the 'chao' of one or other of the standard miskal weights; he will also take out some of the best quality pearls of the ' Bas ' and ' Batin ' sizes for sale by the ' chaothe remainder he will sell in a lump by one or other of the mashad miskal weights. To explain the use of the mashad miskal, we will suppose that the pearls to be sold in the lump by the mashad miskal, weigh 40 mashad miskals, that of these 4 miskals weight remain in the 'Ras' sieve, 10 miskal weight in the ' Batin ' sieve, and 26 miskals remain in or pass through the ' Dzel ' sieve. We will also suppose that the current market price of pearls of the average quality contained in these 40 miskals is R600 per ' tuman' (= 100 mahomedees, vide para. 4); now the invariable rate per mashad miskal of ' Has ' pearls is 200 mahomedees of 'Batin' ,, is 100 ,, of 'Dzel' „ is 25 „ therefore in the parcel above described we have 4 miskals of 200 mahomedees = R4,800 @ R600 per tuman of 100 mahomedees 10 „ ICQ „ = 6,0(JO „ „ „ 26 „ 25 „ = « 3,900 „ j, ?? Total „ 14,700 = price of parcel of pearls weighing 40 mashad miskais as above supposed.116 ADMINISTRATION EEPOIIT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1885-86. It will doubtless have been observed that the ' danik ' weights are not in the relative proportion they nominally bear to the mashad miskal of which they are the recognised sub-divisions. 11. The Gulf pearl merchant having bought as many pearls as he desires, proceeds to assort them into the most saleable parcels possible; the largest pearls he will send to the Indian market to be sold separately by the ' chao/' the others he will divide into parcels, all pearls of the same quality being put into the same parcel; he will then pass the pearls of each parcel through his sieves, which will give the number of pearls of each size in each parcel, and the contents of each sieve on being weighed will show the number of ' chao ' of each sized pearls in the parcel, and the number of ' chao' in each sieve being added together will give the number of ' chao ' in the whole parcel which will be sold, as a whole, in the Indian market at an average price per ' chao '; and I am informed that sold in this way the larger pearls of such parcels fetch a larger proportionate price than they would do if sold singly. 12. I ought not perhaps to conclude this paper without noting that the actual weight of the Arab miskals manufactured year by year according to the will of the clique (to this extent only) of buyers of pearls in the Persian Gulf has, I am informed, for some ten or fifteen years been substantially increasing year by year, and that this increase in the actual size of the weights has been effected by the buyers to counterpoise the increasing prices demanded by the pearl fishers, owing to their growing knowledge of the prices obtained in the Indian and foreign markets by those to whom they sell; but I gather from a cursory examination of weighments I have made of several sets of Arab weights used during the past five years that for the last two or three years these weights have been made lighter,—in other words, that two or three years ago the pearl buyers touched the lowest point at which they could compel the pearl producers to sell, so as to leave themselves (the buyers) the profits they had been accus tomed to realise. 13. In conclusion, it appears to me that a keen appreciation of quality as made up of colour, brilliancy, shape, specific gravity, and size, combined with a knowledge of the Indian and foreign market prices obtainable for the various classes, shapes, and qualities of pearls, and some one standard of weight thoroughly [understood from which to make his private calculations, are the matters most essential to a pearl merchant; while an exact knowledge of the relative values of all the various weights which are used, and a skilful manipulation of them when conducting his bargainings, are extra talents which will sometimes secure an extra profit. Note.—The equivalent in English grains of the Bahrein weights have not been given for the reason that in Muscat I have been unable to obtain a set of them; they appear to be only used at Bahrein itself.
