(b) If in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction more offences than one are committed by the same person, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, every such offence. (c) If the acts alleged constitute an offence falling within two or more definitions or descriptions of offences in any law or laws, the accused may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, each of such offences. {d) If several acts constitute several offences, and also when combined a different offence, the accused may be charged with, and tried at one trial foi, the offence constituted by such acts when combined, or one or more of the several offences, but in the latter case shall not be punished with more severe punishment than the Court which tries him could award for any one of those offences. ( e ) jf a single act or series of acts is of such a nature that it is doubtful which of several offences the facts which can be proved will constitute, the accused may be charged with having committed all or any of such offences, and any number of such charges may be tried at once ; or he may be charged in the alternative with having committed some one of the offences; and if it appears in evidence that he has committed a different offence for which he might have been charged, he may be convicted of that offence, although not charged with it. 52. When more persons than one are accused of the same offence or of different offences committed in the same transaction, or when one is accused of committing anoffence and another of abetting or attempting to -nuniWhat offence, they may be charged and tried together or separately, as t le om 53 -fl) Any Court, if sitting with a jury or Assessors, may alter any charge at any time before the verdict of the jury is returned or the opm.ons of the Assessors are expressed; if sitting without jury or Assessors, at any time before judgment is pronounced.

(3) If the altered charge is such that proceeding with the trial immediately is likely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused or the prosecutor, the Court may adjourn the trial for such period as may be necessary. /-j\ error or omission in stating either the offence oi the particulars shall be regarded at any stage of the case as material, unless the accused was misled by such error or omission. (2) When the facts alleged in certain particulars are proved and constitute an offence, and the remaining particulars are not proved, the accused may be convicted of the offence constituted by the facts proved, although not charged with it. ( 3 ) When a person is charged with an offence and the evidence proves either the commission of a minor offence or an attempt to commit the offence charged, he may he convicted of the minor offence or of the attempt. oo. ( 1 ) If the accused has been previously convicted of any offence, and it is intended to prove such conviction for the purpose of affecting the punishment which the Court is competent to award, the fact, date, and place of the previous conviction shall he stated in the charge. ( 2 ) If such statement is omitted, the Court may add it at any time before sentence is passed. ( 3 ) The part of the charge stating the previous conviction shall not be read out in Court, nor shall the accused he asked whether he has been previously convicted, as alleged in the charge, unless and until he has either pleaded guilty to, or been convicted of, the subsequent offence. (4) If he pleads guilty to, or is convicted of, the subsequent offence, he shall then he asked whether he has been previously convicted, as alleged in the charge. (5) If he answers that he has been so previously convicted, the Court may proceed to pass sentence on him accordingly, but, if he denies that he has been so previously convicted, or refuses to, or does not, answer such question, the Court shall then inquire concerning such previous conviction, and in such case (where the trial is by jury) it shall not he necessary to swear the jurors again. 5(). 41 here a British subject is accused of the commission of an offence the cognizance \v hereof appertains to the Court, and it is expedient that the offence be inquired of, tried, determined, and punished in a British possession, the accused may Malta.

I also enclose a copy of a memorandum from the Acting Judge of the Supreme Consular Court, who considers that under the existing circumstances it is inadvisable to extend the powers of the Baghdad Provincial Judge: while, if the suggestion for importing Indian labour were to be carried out, special arrangements of all kinds would have to be made, and it would be necessary that they should bring their own judicial machinery with them. I have therefore pointed out to His Majesty’s Government that this part of the question might be left until the scheme as a whole is more matured. I have forwarded vour despatch to His Majesty’s Government to be sub mitted to those who are drafting the new Order in pound! in order that they may take into consideration your remarks on the subject of registration as well as the suggestions of the Acting Judge of the Supreme Court and of His Majesty’s Consul-General at Constantinople. I do not hold with His Majesty’s Consul-General at Baghdad that the Ottoman Government has reasonable cause to object to our protection of bona, Me British subjects who are permanently resident in Turkey, because they are Moslems. But I have always regretted the change in the Order in Council making the registration of British Indians compulsory. The old system of allowing registration and denying protection if registration were not accomplished is to my mind far preferable : otherwise Indians never approach the Consulate until they have a difficulty of some sort and then they demand and, if their papers are in order, are accorded the rights of British subjects. Previously they have in most cases passed themselves off as Ottoman subjects. The fee for registration of 2/6d is already too small. Passports ought not to be given lightly. I am afraid that in India very little care is taken before issuing a pr ssport. But a passport ought to be a good evidence of nationality. I protest against any leniency in the granting of the same for purposes of travel. They should be essential. to answer, as he appears to have read into my report a good deal more than it contains.

H. C. A. Eybres. Memorandum, dated Constantinople, the 26th July 1909. There is a new Ottoman Order in Council shortly coming into force and several of the suggestions made in Colonel Ramsay’s memorandum are therein provided for as shown hereafter. With regard to the first suggestion as to the desirability of increasing the powers of the Provincial Judge at Baghdad in order to provide against delay and the expense in procuring a Judge of the Supreme Court to deal with such cases, I would point out that during the last l7ve“s it has only been necessary for a Judge of the Supreme Court to visit Baghdad on three Occasions, the last occasion being in 1904 when it was necessary for me to proceed thither for a murder trial of some importance. On referring to the annual returns of criminal cases from the Provincial Court of B igbdad for 1908, I find that the number of cases dealt with by that Court amounted to only three. I am inclined to agree that it would be desirable if the P°wers of ment to be administered by the Provincial Courts not only in Baghdad but m other far distant places of the Ottoman Dominions could be increased in special cases under the direction and authority of the Supreme ^ Court. Phis point miffht be considered in the new Order in Council which is m course of comple- LlUJLi* ' I have had considerable experience in the working of the Indian Penal Codes both as President of the Court of Appeal for the East African Protec torates and as Judge for the High Court for Zanzibar in which Courts ^ these Codes were applied. Although there are certain advantages in their use there are also a great many drawbacks, and I think nothing would be gained in the present case by their adoption and it would be, I think, a very undesir able thing and lead to difficulties for the British Courts to administer different forms of law and procedure in different parts of the Ottoman Dominions. The British European population, of which there is a fair sprinkling both at Baghdad and Basrah in commercial, shipping and banking business, would undoubtedly re sent being tried by the Indian Penal Code, and I think with good reason. With regard to the forecast of what the future may bring forth should the irrigation scheme be carried through, I think at tbe present time it would he futile to attempt to legislate for a contingency of this kind. Even supposing the money is forthcoming in the near future for these works, it would appear to be cheaper and more desirable to employ Ottoman labour as far as possible. Supposing also that Indian labour was considered better, it is doubtful if the Indian Government would permit it to be imported for the purpose. It was with some difficulty that Indian labour was procured for the Uganda Railway which was a British Government enterprise in a British Protectorate—quite a different affair. Accepting this proposal as possible, however, no doubt special legislation would be provided, as in the case of the Uganda Railway, in which case the coolies were policed by special Inidian police and a special Magistrate appointed to deal with all cases in connection with those employed on the railway works. I do not think therefore this part of Colonel Ramsay’s memorandum requires very serious consideration at the present time. With regard to paragraph 4 of the memorandum “ British Ships ” is defined in the draft rules of the draft Order in Council in practically the same terms as the Persian Order, so that this suggestion will be met when the pew Ottoman Order in Council comes into force.To exclude the Italian language might cause inconvenience in other parts of the Ottoman Empire, and its retention can do no harm to Baghdad. Liti gants as a rule are only too anxious to put their cases in a language understood by the Judge hearing the case. I have never found any difficulty in this respect. Registration. I am not personally able to express my opinion, as this matter rests with the Consuls. I would point out that in the draft of the new Ottoman Order in Council, Article No. 159 adopts Article No. 46(4) of the Persian Order in Council as Colonel Ramsay desires. I think it would not be desirable to change the wording as it would leave too great a power in the bands of the Consular Officers. There is already left a considerable discretion by the latter part of the wording of this article. Article 46 (3) of the Persian Order in Council has also been embodied in the draft of the new Ottoman Order in Council exclusive of the last paragraph. In conclusion, I would venture to recommend that Colonel Ramsay’s memorandum should be submitted to the Foreign Office without delay in order that the legal advisers may have an opportunity of considering the sug gestions he makes therein, before the new Ottoman Order in Council is finally settled, which will, I believe, be almost immediately.

There is no need for me to trouble Government with the details of the particular case which gave rise to the correspondence, as I merely make this reference in connection with the concluding paragraph of Judge Gator’s letter of 17th Pebruary 1909. It will he seen that he contemplates considering the advisability of group ing the Persian Gulf with the Ottoman Dominions for the purposes of the Fugitive Offenders Act. The instances in which the need is felt for recourse to the provisions o^ \ the said Act, are so infrequent, that I am not of opinion that the advantage to ; he gained would be commensurable with the inconvenience which might con ceivably arise from our bringing the Persian Gulf within the scope of any definition signifying “ the dominions of the Sublime Ottoman Porte In any case, the point raised is one which the Government of India will he interested to consider.

Bahrein is not grouped with the Ottoman Dominions for the purposes of Part II of the Fugitive Offenders Act. Consequently you must be satisfied that the alleged offence falls within section 9 of the Act, and if you issue a provisional warrant you must report to the Ambassador as required by section 4, or if you have the original warrant it must be sent for endorsement either to the Ambassador or a Judge of the Supreme Court under section 3. Provided that you receive information which really satisfies you that an offence appears to have been committed, particularly if you^ are satisfied that a warrant has already been issued, I think you would be justified in taking the oath of an officer of the Court founded upon the letter or telegram m which the information is contained. As the Order in Council is being revised at the present time, I will con sider the advisability of grouping the Persian Gulf with the Ottoman Domi nions for the purposes of the Act.

Copy. No. Yr Not sent to F. O Sent in dupli cate Sent to Govt, of In dia. Copy to Consul, Basrah. British Eesidency &amp; Consulate General, Baghdad, 21st June 1909. Sir, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that since my arrival at Baghdad some three years ago it has seemed to me that the judicial arrange ments which are suited to the rest of Turkey are not well suited to the Vilayets of Baghdad, especially, and of Basrah. Under Section 31 of the Ottoman Order in Council a Provincial Court, i.e. 9 the Court of a Consul General or Consul, can award as a maximum punishment up to 12 months’ imprisonment with hard labour and a fine not exceeding £50. If any case should occur which calls for more severe punishment a Judge of the Supreme Court has to come from Constantinople to try the case. Considering the state of communications between Constantinople and Baghdad and Basrah 3 , this seems an unsuitable arrangement, and one that is likely to put the State to considerable expense, as well as likely to cause delay in the administration of justice, unless it is assumed that the Judge of the Supreme Court can always find two months to spare on one case, which may be a very simple one. Another difficulty as far as Baghdad is concerned is that the Consul General has to act in conformity with the Law and Procedure of the Law of England, with which he probably has no practical acquaintance, and which he cannot easily ascertain. He has, on the other hand, probably a good working knowledge of the Indian Law and Procedure, and he knows exactly where to find informa tion on any point regarding ^ which he is in doubt. Your Excellency is no doubt aware that the Indian Law is comparatively simple owing to its being codified. It is not likely .that any one will be appointed as Resident at Baghdad who has not had experience as a Sessions Judge in India. Section 9 of the Ottoman Order in Council provides for the appointment by the Secretary of State of a Special Judge of the Supreme Court for the disposal of any particular case, but the Resident could not be appointed as a Special Judge, becase under Section 9 (1) and (2) the Special Judge must be a Member of the Bar of not less than seven years’ standing. 2. I find that in 1908 there were 1,824 British subjects registered at Baghdad and Karbala including dependants. Of these 51 were of European origin, and 1,773 of Asiatic descent. It would seem therefore that as far as the bulk of the British subjects are concerned Indian Law would be more suitable than English Law. What has decided me to trouble Your Excellency with an immediate reference on this subject is the receipt of an intimation from Sir William Willcocks that if money is sanctioned to carry cfut his irrigation projects he v ill require at least 15,000 Indian labourers, and that in case of large sums being granted he may require ten times that number. Even with the smaller number there is sure to be a considerable number of followers such as bakers, barbers, tailors, cooks, etc., and the total British population of Asiatic descent within the jurisdiction of the Consul General at Baghdad will probably 1/! f be about 18,000. I think it will be admitted that with such a population as this some revision of our judicial machinery will be imperative, and this cannot be arranged at a moment’s notice. If this view is correct, the law at present in force will have to be altered so as to enlarge the powers of the Consul General, or the Indian Law can be brought into force. If Your Excellency is inclined to recommend the latter course the following remarks may be of use. 3 The Indian Law is in force in Southern Persia under “The Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1907 ” which was published in the London Gazette of the 10th May 1907. It might perhaps be thought desirable to issue a somewhat similar Order, to be put in force in the Vilayets of Baghdad and Basrah, which are the two Vilayets where there is likely to be a large influx of British Asiatic subjects. The Persian Order and the Ottoman Order are not arranged on the same system and consequently they are very difficult to compare with any exactitude. To simplify this task I attach as Appendix I to this letter a comparative table in two parts. Part I gives the sections of the Ottoman Order in sequence, and against each section is quoted the corresponding section of the Persian Order . in Part II the sections of the Persian Order are in ^ sequence. With the help of this index, and a few spare copies of the Order which can be cut up, the two Orders can be easily compared. There are of course many sections in each Order which do not appear in the other Order} but the reason for this is generally obvious on reference to the text. 4. There are only a few sections which seem to me to call for remarks, based on local knowledge. Section 3 of the Ottoman Order defines a number of terms including “ British Merchant Ship.” The Persian Order defines a “British Ship” in such a way as to cover sailing ships bought locally and owned by British sub jects. Section 94 of the Ottoman Order should I think be maintained in any Law that may be adopted. It is very desirable, in this country, that British subjects should be under an immediate obligation to obey orders and that means should exist for enforcing orders without delay. It must be remembered that all here are not subject to the same law, and delay in mixed cases may lead to very undesirable complications with the Turkish Authorities or ^Foreign Repre sentatives. In England or India a man who wearies of the law’s delays has no choice but to submit: here a Frenchman who thinks he is not getting justice, if he takes the law into his own hands is liable to be tried, not before the British authorities, but before an authority that probably strongly sympathises with him and has been supporting him. Section 138 of the Ottoman Order provides for pleadings, etc., being in English, French or Italian. Italian is not commonly spoken in Baghdad, there is no member of the Consulate Staff who knows it, and there is not likely to be one. We have, in practice, to accept documents in English, French, Turkish, Arabic, Persian and Hindustani, and the Law should not force upon us a seventh language which is not used in the country. 5. Section 165 deals with the Registration of British subjects, and this is a matter which is I think deserving of very careful attention, seeing what possibilities there are of Indian immigration on a large scale. In Baghdad the law makes no difference between a Christian Englishman and a Muhammadan Asiatic. Of the latter class there are a certain number of true Indians whose sympathies and interests are connected with India, and who can be recognised at a glance as Indians, and consequently British subjects : but there are very many more who have been born and bred in this country, of Arab or Persian mothers, who speak and dress like natives of the country, and who are in my opinion willing to recognise the privileges without admitting the liabilities of British nationality. Their progenitors probably came here because they were Muhammadans and wished to live under Muhammadan rule : I can see no reason why such people should get any more protection than is their strict right according to law. I have often thought it very unfair on Turkish sub jects that persons should be able to claim British protection who in dress andspeech are indistinguishable from Turkish and Persian subjects. As far as my experience goes both Englishmen and Indians are treated with respect and consideration, where they are known as such. A Turkish subject who abuses or assaults a man who looks and speaks like an Arab seems to me to have a fair cause for complaint when the‘latter appeals to the Consulate : for the Turkish subject would probably have acted differently had he known that he was dealing with a foreigner; In civil transactions also it is hard on a Tur kish subject to find himself taken before the Mercantile Court by a man whom he bad no reason to think a foreigner. Had he known that he was a foreigner he might have been more careful in his conduct or even declined to do busi ness with him. It is the country-bred British subjects who are the cause of most of the mixed criminal cases, and I think the Turkish Government has reasonable cause to object to our pretensions to claim protection over Muhammadans who are per manently resident in Turkey, who have been born here, who have no intention of leaving Turkey, who can speak neither English nor Hindustani, and who are in fact indistinguishable from Turkish subjects. The Ottoman Order in Council is not I think so well suited to the circumstances of Baghdad as is the Persian Order in Council, and I therefore offer a few remarks on the latter order in case Your Excellency may be inclined to recommend its adoption, •with some alterations, in those parts of Turkey which are more closely con nected with India than with Europe. Under the Ottoman Order failure to register is a criminal offence, but under the Persian Order it is optional, only a person who does not register himself within a month of his arrival, or in January cannot claim as of right British protection, though he remains subject to British jurisdiction. I think the Persian Order is far preferable, for recognition as a British subject should, in my opinion, be considered a great privilege and not a liability. The Ottoman Order while it lays down that the Consul can decline to recognise as a British subject a person who has not registered himself, does not affirm that such a person is liable to consular jurisdiction. In Persia the fee for registratio n is one rupee, here it is rupees two or half- a-crown : the latter sum does notseem to me too much seeing the advantage that British nationality carries with it in the matter of exemption from mili tary service and some taxes. Section 46 (2) of the Persian Order runs as follows : — “ A person of Asiatic descent arriving within the said limits, and applying to be registered as a British subject, shall be so registered if he {a) produces a passport as a British subject from British India or a British possession: or (b) files an affidavit or sworn declaration showing that he was born within His Majesty’s dominions or within the territory of any Prince or State in India under the suzerainty, or in alliance with His Majesty, or that he has been naturalised in the United Kingdom : and (c) in either case gives satisfactory evidence of bis identity ”. In my opinion these provisions are far too stringent. I think that the word “ may ^ should be substituted for the word “shall” and it might be pro vided that in all cases in which registration is refused under this section the reasons shall be recorded in writing. Passports are more easily obtained than are Registration Certificates, 3S T o one is legally entitled to enter Turkey without a passport and it causes great inconvenience to a traveller to he delayed while enquiries are being made from his home, consequently I think the practice is to he rather lenient in the matter of granting passports for a journey. I have known a case in which a man to whom I refused registration went to India with the special object of obtaining a passport, and obtained one on the strength of which he demanded registra tion, Eurther I think that a passport should not he considered essential, for these are only issued to satisfy the law of Turkey, and are not required by our own law: many fowd/fote British subjects arrive without them, and having arrived here it is difficult to obtain them from India or a British possession. 3As regards affidavits and sworn statements, they are in my opinion worth less, unless the circumstances are such that they can be tested. As regards persons naturalised in the United Kingdom, the Persian Order as it stands will not suit Turkey : otherwise Turkish subjects naturalised in the united King- dom might claim registration. I think that this section would he more suitable if it merely stated what evidence should ordinarily be accepted as sufficient, and left the Consul a large margin of discretion. Section 46 (3) of the Persian Order runs as follows “ A person horn within the said limits, being the child of a person of Asiatic descent who arrived within the said limits, may be registered as a British subiect if it is proved that the father (a) was registered as a British subject at the time of the child’s birth : or (b) being entitled, was prevented from being so registered by causes for which he was not responsible. Any child of a person registered under the provisions of this article shall not be entitled to be registered as a British subject by reason only that his father and grandfather were so registered.” Some provision of this nature is urgently required in Baghdad. In Turkey registration was not compulsory until the commencement of “ The Ottoman Order in Council, 1899 consequently it would scarcely he fair to demand that the father of the person claiming registration should have been registered as a British subject when that person was born. It would probably be suffix cient to lay down that the person claiming registration must have been regu larly registered, as a minor,' on the back of his father s certificate. Should the law in this part of Turkey be made more like the Persian Law than it is at present, I think that Consular Officers whose duty it would be to carry out the new Law should draw up for Your Excellency s approval a memorandum showing the general principles which they would follow in exer cising the discretion allowed to them in dealing with claimants of Asiatic origin. Our object should, I think, be to limit our protection to such persons only who (a) are strictly entitled to it according to English or Indian Law: (b) can be recognised as foreigners by those with whom they are brought into contact: (&lt;?) have some special claim to protection, e g., have served the Gov ernment or are important political pensioners, or are trustees of Indian money, etc. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your Excellency’s Most obedient humble Servant; (Sd.)

(2.) In each of the two following cases, namely :— (i.) Where the offence charged is rape, arson, housebreaking, robbery with violence, forgery, or perjury ; or (ii.) Where the offence charged is any other than aforesaid, but it appears to the Court at any time before the trial, the opinion of the Court being recorded in the Minutes, that the offence charged, if proved, would not be adequately punished by imprisonment for three months with hard labour, or by a line of twenty pounds, or both such imprisonment and fine ; the charge shall be triable with a jury or Assessors (according to the provisions of this Order applic able to the Court) ; but may, with the consent of the accused, be tried without Assessors or jury. In the Supreme Court, when the accused does not so consent, the charge shall be tried with a jury, unless the Court is of opinion that a jury cannot be obtained. (3.) The Supreme Court may, for any special reason, direct that any case shall be tried with Assessors or a jury, and a Provincial Court may, for any special reason, direct that any case shall be tried with Assessors.

Preliminary Examination. (!•) Where the accused is before the Court, and it appears to the Court that the com plaint discloses an offence— {a.) Which ought to be tried in or reported to another Court; or (b.) Which ought to be tried before the same Court with a jury or Assessors ; the Court shall proceed to mak 1 a preliminary examination in the prescribed manner. (2.) If after such preliminary examination the accused is ordered to be tried, the Court shall bind by recognizance the prosecutor and every witness to appear at the trial to prosecute, or to prosecute and give evidence, or to give evidence (as the case may be). 49. - (1.) If a British subject, having appeared as prosecutor or witness at a preliminary examina tion, refuses to enter into a recognizance to appear at the trial to prosecute or give evidence, the Court may send him to prison, there to remain until after the trial, unless in the meantime he enters into a recognizance. (2.) But if afterwards, from want of sufficient evidence or other cause, the accused is discharged, the Court shall order that the person imprisoned for so refusing be also discharged. (3.) Where the prosecutor or witness is not a British subject, the Court may require him either to enter into a recognizance or to give other security for his attendance at the trial, and, if he fails to do so, may in its discretion dismiss the charge. 50. — (1.) The charge upon winch an accused person is tried shall state the offence charged, with such particulars as to the time and place of the alleged offence, and the person (if any) against whom or the thing (if any) in respect of which it was committed, as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged. (2.) The fact that a charge is made is equiva lent to a statement that every legal condition [822] &amp;22 required d)y law to constitute tire offence charged was fulfilled in the particular case. (3.) Where the nature of the case is such that the particulars above mentioned do not give such sufficient notice as aforesaid, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner in which the alleged offence was committed as will give such sufficient notice. (4.) For the purposes of the application of any Statute law, a charge framed under the provisions of this Order shall he deemed to he an indict ment. 51. For every distinct offence of which any person is accused there shall he a separate charge, and every such charge shall he tried separately, except in the cases following, that is to say :— (a.) Where a person is accused of more offences than one of the same kind committed within the space of twelve months from the first to the last of such offences, he may he charged with, and tried at one trial for, any number of them not exceeding three. (6.) If in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction more offences than one are committed by the same person, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, every such offence. (c.) If the acts alleged constitute an offence failing within two or more definitions or descrip tions of offences in any law or laws, the accused may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, each of such offences. (d.) If several acts constitute several offences, and also when combined a different offence, the accused may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, the offence constituted by such acts when combined, or one or more of the several offences, but in the latter case shall not be punished with more severe punishment than the Court which tries him could award for any one of those offences. (&lt;?.) If a single act or series of acts is of such a nature that it is doubtful which of several offences the facts which can be proved will constitute, the accused may be charged with having committed all or any of such offences, and any number of such charges may be tried at once ; or he may be charged in the alternative with having com mitted some one of the offences ; and if it appears in evidence that he has committed a differentoffence for which he might have been charged, he may be convicted of that offence, although not charged with it. 52. W hen more persons than one are accused of the same offence or of different offences com mitted in the same transaction, or when one is accused of committing an offence and another of abetting or attempting to commit that offence, they may he charged and tried together or separately, as the Court thinks fit. 53. (1.) Any Court, if sitting with a jury oi Assessors, may alter any charge at any time before the verdict of the jury is returned or the opinions of the Assessors are expressed ; if sitting without jury or Assessors, at any time before judgment is pronounced. (2.) Every such alteration shall be read and explained to the accused. (3.) If the altered charge is such that pro ceeding with the trial immediately is likely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused or the prosecutor, the Court may adjourn the trial for such period as may be necessary. 54. —(L) No error or omission in stating either the offence or the particulars shall be regarded at any stage of the case as material, unless the accused, was misled by such error or omission. (2.) When the facts alleged in certain par ticulars are proved and constitute an offence, and the remaining particulars are not proved, the accused may be convicted of the offence con stituted by the facts proved, although not charged with it. (3.) When a person is charged with an offence and the evidence proves either the commission of a minor offence or an attempt to commit the offence charged, he may be convicted of the minor offence or of the attempt. 55. — (1.) If the accused has been previously convicted of any offence, and it is intended to prove such conviction for the purpose of effecting the punishment which the Court is competent to award, the fact, date, and place of the previous conviction shall be stated in the charge. (2.) If such statement is omitted, the Court may add it at any time before sentence is passed.(3.) The part of the charge stating the pre vious conviction shall not he read out in Court, nor shall the accused he asked whether he has heen previously convicted, as alleged in the charge, unless and until he has either pleaded guilty to, or been convicted of, the subsequent offence. (4.) If he pleads guilty to, or is convicted of, the subsequent offence, he shall then be asked whether he has been previously convicted, as alleged in the charge. (5.) If he answers that he has been so pre viously convicted, the Court may proceed to pass sentence on him accordingly, but, if he denies that he has been so previously convicted, or refuses to, or does not, answer such question, the Court shall then inquire concerning such previous conviction, and in such case (where the trial is by jury) it shall not be necessary to swear the jurors again. 56. Where a British subject is accused of the commission of an offence the cognizance whereof appertains to the Court, and it is expedient that the offence be inquired of, tried, determined, and punished in a British possession, the accused may (under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, section 6) be sent for trial to Bombay or Malta. The Supreme Court may, where it appears so expedient, by warrant under the hand of the Judge and the seal of the Court, cause the accused to be sent for trial to Bombay or Malta accordingly. The warrant shall be sufficient authority to any person to whom it is directed to receive and detain the person therein named, and to carry him to and deliver him up to Bombay or to Malta (as the case may be), according to the warrant. Where any person is to be so sent to Bombay or to Malta, the Court before which he is charged shall take the preliminary examination, and shall bind over such of the proper witnesses as are British subjects in their own recognizances to appear and give evidence on the trial. Punishments. 57. The powers of the Courts with respect to punishments are limited as follows :— (1.)

(3.) Damages so ordered to be paid may be recoverable in like manner as a fine. (4.) On payment of such damages no action shall lie for malicious prosecution without the leave of the Court. (5.)

The necessity for an amending Order led to the Judge being consulted as to whether he thought any other Articles required amendment, and the number of his suggestions, coupled with the fact that the Ottoman Order of 1899 follows a model which is now practically obsolete, led to the preparation of a whole new Order instead of a mere amending Order. 2. In drafting it I have followed so far as possible the China Order in Council of 1904. I think that, as a general principle, the Orders in Council regulating our extraterritorial jurisdic tions should be based on the same model: it facilitates the work of the Judges in case of transfer, and ensures greater homogeneity in the system. 3. In the definition Article I have amended that of British ship and made it wider than that of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894. I have not gone quite so far as the Persian Coasts and Islands Order in Council, 1907, because there are some places in the Order where the context, I think, shovrs that “ British ship ” is used in the Merchant Shipping Act sense. I have excluded the definition of British pro tected person under British subject; it reads as if it were an exhaustive definition and was in consequence misleading; the phrase is much wider than the definition suggested ; it includes not only natives of Protectorates and of native States in India, but everyone to whom in fact the Secretary of State does extend diplomatic protection. 4. Article 7 is new ; it is founded on Article 15 of the China and Corea Order, 1907, which re enacted the old form of Article for whichArticle 27 of tlie China Order has been sub stituted. 5. In Article 8 (establishing the Supreme Court) I have adopted the more elastic form usual in modern Orders, retaining the title of Assistant Judge (see 9972/08). 6. In Article 14 (sittings of the Supreme Court) I have adopted Judge Caters sugges tions, as also in Article 15 (District Registrars). 7. In Article 17, creating Provincial Courts, I have followed the precedent of the Siam Order, 1906. The hard and fast system of every commissioned Consul forming a Court for his own district has ceased to work satisfactorily, as in some cases districts are not assigned and in others they overlap. I have, however, in Article 18 (founded on Article 2 of the China Order, 1907) provided for additional Judges of a Provincial Court. Article 19 adopts the same elastic system to Local Courts. Article 20 is new; its object is to ensure that information as to the Courts that exist and their districts shall be easily accessible to the public. The introduction of the more elastic system will obviate the need for amending the old Article 11 (as to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in the Consular district of Con stantinople) in the way the Judge suggests, as the provision itself disappears. Under the new draft, Provincial or Local Courts can be set up at or near Constantinople. 8. In Article 45 I have added piracy as one of the crimes that must be tried before the Supreme Court on a charge. 9. The effect of Articles 47, 48, and 50 will be, I think, to introduce a change of procedure, because a person will not be tried on a charge, if he is tried summarily. He will only be tried on a charge where he has been committed for trial after a preliminary examination, whereas Article 82 of the 1899 Order required that every accused person should be tried on a charge. The change however will, I think, be an improvement, and lias already been introduced in China. 10. Punishment for a grave offence under Article 59 remains the same as under the existing Order, but I have met the Judge’s views by altering the penalties provided under Article 69 (formerly 57) and Article 70 (formerly 155). 11. Articles 60 and 61 embody amendments suggested by the Judge, see his notes on Article 47 of the existing Order.3 12. Article 62 abolishes the system under which a person convicted of murder was first sentenced to death and then the case was referred to the Secretary of State who directed what punishment was to be imposed, but it could not exceed twenty years’ imprisonment. The Article in the existing Order (46) is, in any case, unsatisfactory, because it apparently leaves persons convicted of treason or piracy jure gentium liable to the death penalty. 1 he new Article follows the corresponding Articles in the China and Corea Order, 1904 (Article 64), and the Siam Order, 1906 (Article 54). 13. In Article 68 on Inquests I have gone a little further than the Judge suggests as to giving power to a Local Court to hold an inquest, venture to think that if an uncommissioned Con sular Officer is not fit to hold an inquest, he would not be appointed (under the new Article 19) to hold a Local Court at alh 14. Article 69 is a new form of the old Article 57, and is identical with Article 3 of the China and Corea Order in Council, 1907, except that I have varied the penalties to meet the views of the Judge in his notes on Article 27 of the existing Order. 15. Article 70 is an amended version of the- Article 155 of the existing Order to meet the point made by the Judge in his notes on Article 27 as to smuggling hashish into Egypt, 16. Article 71 is new; corresponding Articles appear in the China and Corea Order, 1904 (Article 71) and the Siam Order, 1906 (Article 61). Article 72 is also new, and in view of the language of Article 2 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Neutrality Order in Council, 1904, is probably superfluous, but I think that these Orders should, so far as possible, be self-contained, and that there will be no harm in inserting it. 17. Articles 73 and 74 are also new, but are provisions it is clearly desirable to insert. 18. Article 76 takes the place of the existing Article 157 and is founded on Article 5 of the China and Corea Order, 1907. In view, however, of the experience there has recently been in Corea, I have made the person con victed liable to deportation for the first offence, and have altered the last Sub-Article so as to enable the preliminary examination, &amp;c., to be conducted by the Provincial Court. 19. Article 81. Deportation. 1 have amendedSub-Article (4) so as to enable a person who be longs to tbe United Kingdom to be deported to the United Kingdom; this will meet the case of Captain Norman (see papers ending with 23544/08), and provides for one of the points raised by the Judge. I have also amended Sub-Article (3) by pro viding that where a man has given security to be of good behaviour, &amp;c. r and then while the security is in force is again troublesome, he may be deported; previously the only remedy was to estreat the recognizances. I think this is both reasonable and useful. Sub-Article (7) is amended to meet another point made by the Judge. Sub-Article 9 is new; it is taken from the Siam Order, 1906, Article 69. 20. Articles 82-87 are entirely new, and intro duce into our Courts in the Ottoman Dominions a system of criminal appeal on the lines of the Criminal Appeal Act of 1907. The spirit of these Foreign Jurisdiction Orders in Council is that so far as. may be jurisdiction shall be exercised on the same lines as it is in England, and therefore I think the powers of appeal in criminal cases should be based on the same prin ciples as those obtaining in this country. I have endeavoured to embody in these x\rticles a simpli fied form of the system of appeal provided under the recent Act. 21. In Part IV of the draft. “ Civil matters.” I have omitted a large number of the Articles now appearing in the Order in Council with a view to their being transferred to Rules of Court; they deal onty with matters of procedure, and have been omitted from the more recent Foreign Jurisdiction Orders in Council. Annexed to this Memorandum will be found a Table of the Articles omitted for this reason. 22. Article 106 introduces in the Ottoman Dominions a provision that land should be re garded as personal estate, and should descend as such in case of intestacy. A similar rule has been introduced in China (Article 103 of hto Order in Council, 1904), and in Siam (Article 93, Siam Order, 1906). It meets to a great extent the points raised by the Judge in his note on Article 63 of the existing Order ; it perhaps meets it altogether, though I am uncertain whether a Court would hold that it enabled a Mahommedan British subject to leave property away from his children in con travention of Mussulman rules ; at any rate itmeets it as well as the clause that the Judge himself suggests. It also meets the difficulties felt by the Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, and will, I think, be as satisfactory as the clause suggested by Sir M. Mcllwraith and Mr. Brunyate (see Sir E. Gorst, No. 9, 18th April, 14084/08). 23. Article 119 is new and is copied from Article 4 of the China and Corea Order, 1907. 24. Article 120 is also new and was suggested by Sir II. de Sausmarez in 1907 as a provision that was occasionally desirable to resort to in China ; it is copied from Article 10 of the China and Corea Order, 1907. Article 121 deals with a kindred subject and is also new ; it is a sugges tion of the Judge’s (see his notes on Article 137\ 25. In Article 122 I have provided two alterna tives : one maintaining the existing system under which appeals only lie from the Provincial Court to the Supreme Court, and from the latter to the Privy Council; but a litigant dissatisfied with the judgment of the Supreme Court may (under Article 79 of the existing order, 123 of the new draft) obtain an order for a rehearing. The other, copied from the Siam Order, 1906 (Article 122), under which an appeal lies from either the Pro vincial Court or the Supreme Court to the two Supreme Court Judges sittiug together as the full Court. The observations of the Judges, Consuls, and legal practitioners in the Ottoman Dominions as to which would be best would be useful. Article 123 in its new form is taken from Article 11 of the China Order, 1907. 26. Article 128 is a more modern form of the provision relating to Rules of Court. In his note on Article 136 of the existing Order the Judge questions the right to prescribe probate fees under Article 136 as it stands. I feel no doubt that the power is covered by Article 136, but in any case the Foreign Jurisdiction (Probates) Order in Council would give the right, as such Order, now in course of enactment, is applied by Article 118 of this Order. 27. Articles 132 and 133 are new, and are copied from the China and Siam Orders ; it is very desirable that the Courts should possess these powers. Article 136 applies the Public Authorities Protection Act to the Ottoman Do minions, which is also a desirable provision. 28. Article 143 deals with the power to make King’s Regulations. In the 1899 Order the [823J Om m I power is vested in the Ambassador and the Judge, and by the 1905 Order the powers of the Ambassador were, so far as concerns Regu lations for Egypt, transferred to the Agent for Egypt, so that at the present time King’s Regulations in Egypt are made by the Agent and the Judge. In the new draft the legislative power is vested in the Ambassador (or the Agent for Egypt) alone ; the legislative and the judicial functions should be kept distinct. The Articles dealing with King’s Regulations follow the more modern model in force in China. 29. Articles 150 to 163 deal with the question of the registration of British subjects, and take the place of the existing Article on that subject. They are modelled on those now in force in Siam. Article 158 renders a person wdio fails to register himself liable to a penalty. The Judge in his notes raises the question whether registration is an administrative or a judicial act. I think there can be no doubt but that it is administrative and that it must remain so. Throughout these Articles the duties are imposed on the Consular officers as such and not on the Courts in which they preside. 30. A suggestion is made in the Judge’s notes that the present registration provisions are in convenient in so far as they provide for the renewal of all registrations in January in each year, and as a remedy it is proposed that in special cases registration should cease to be annual and last for a definite term of years. I appreciate the point, but there are obvious ad vantages in the registrations all taking place about the same time of the year, and I think that the difficulty will be to a very great extent met by the provision in the new Article 156, that re newals of registration may be effected without personal attendance. 31. The proposals made by the Judge with regard to seamen out of employment are under the consideration of the Board of Trade ; for the present, therefore, I have omitted them. 32. I annex a Table of the Articles in the Order in Council of 1899 which should, in my opinion, be transferred to Rules of Court, and also a Table showing the Articles in the 1899 Order that correspond with the Articles of the new draft.

Ottoman Order in Council, 1899, and the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881, to Yemen and the other Turkish possessions in Arabia. 2. We concur in the recommendation of the Bombay Government that, on the occurrence of a convenient opportunity, Aden should be included in section 52 (d) of the Ottoman Order in Council, 1899, as part of the same group of British possessions as the Ottoman dominions and Malta and Gibraltar. We consider that the amendment would be useful, as it would provide for the surrender of British subjects or of natives of British protectorates, who are British subjects within the meaning of that term as used in the Ottoman Order in Council of 1899, and therefore come within the jurisdiction of His Majesty in Turkish dominions.

I am directed to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, copy of a letter No. 2604, dated the 29th April 1906, from the Political Resident, Aden, together with Government letter No. 4434 of to-day’s date, ii j iiT i mn i in i mu i, rr tt regarding the applicability of the Otto- t Fagea 734 Collection of statutes man* Order in Council, 1899, and the relating to India, Volume n.

DeBrath, C.B., C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident, Aden, To—The Chief Secretary to Government, Political Department, Bombay. I have the honour to request that I may be informed whether the Ottoman Order§ in Council of 1899 is applicable 4 ill. uni j i u — i- locr^r. tT ^ y emenj an q 0 ther parts of the Ottoman dominions in Arabia. 2. Should this be so, I have the honour to request that 1 may he informed II Pages 734—748 of the Collection of Statutes of the exact procedure which should he relating to India. Volume ii. followed in Aden, in order to secure the return of offenders under the Fugitive Offenders’ll Act of 1881. 3. Under Section 52 of the Ottoman Order in Council, the Ambassador at Constantinople takes the place of a Governor of a British possession, and the Supreme Court, and each Provincial Court, is substituted for a Magistrate of any part of His Majesty’s dominions. And, I observe, that under clause {d) of that Section, the Ottoman dominions and Malta and Gibraltar are deemed one group of British dominions, for the purposes of Part II of the Fugitive Offenders’ Act of 1881. 4. Under Government Resolution in the Judicial Department, No. 7277, dated 19th December 1887, it would appear that should a warrant be addressed to an officer whose presence cannot be obtained at the preliminary proceedings there referred to, then the seal of the Governor or Lieutenant-Governor of the Province should be affixed to each copy of the exhibits there prescribed. 5. As far as Aden is concerned, it would be convenient if communications regarding the return of Fugitive Offenders could be addressed, in certain cases, to the Consul at Jeddah, or the Vice-Consul at Hodeidah. And it would further be convenient if the Political Resident s seal were held sufficient for the purposes referred to in the last preceding paragraph. It would further ^ Pages 738-740 in the Collection of statutes of course be convenient if the Ottoman plating to India, Volume ii. dominions and Aden could be deemed one group of British possessions, for the purposes of Part HU of the Fugitive Offenders’ Act of 1881. 6. The particular case out of which this reference has arisen is briefly as follows. On the 18th March last, a boat belonging to one of the Government Uight house keepers at Perim was stolen by certain men, who deserted from aTurkish dhow then in the harbour. One of these men was known to be an inhabitant of Hodeidah, and there was reason to believe that the stolen boat was taken to Hodeidah, and there disposed of. 7. Of course the boat might have been taken to even a nearer place in the Ottoman dominions, such as Mokha, or even Sheikh Said, on the opposite side of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. And any day it might occur that some other offenders might similarly abscond into neighbouring Ottoman territory. In point of fact, some weeks ago, a resident of Perim actually did commit a murderous assault upon certain other persons in the Island, and then made good his escape in the night, in a small boat which he found on the shore, and which he promptly stole for the purpose. This offender’s exact wherea bouts are not known. But the question is, what action could be taken to secure his arrest and return should definite information be received of his actual whereabouts in adjoining Ottoman territory. 8. The Ottoman Order in Council* of 1899 does not, as respects Egypt, extend south of the 22nd parallel of north “ d_i ii latitude, but it would not appear that this limitation applies to the other dominions of the Sublime Ottoman Porte. At the same time, I am not a vare of the extent to which His Majesty’s jurisdic tion, referred to in the preamble to the Order in Council of 1899, extend to Arabia. MW'BB IWO) ITuji Cfgr. 9. I would take this opportunity to enquire to what extent the Treaty + of the 14th August 1876, between Great Britain and Prance, for the reciprocal extradition of criminals, applies to the colony of Jubouti, and to state, generally, that Aden is so situated, in the vicinity of Turkish, French, and Italian possessions, as to render it desirable that there should be special facilities for the mutual extradition of offenders.
