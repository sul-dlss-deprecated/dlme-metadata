Rainfall and harvest.—'Khz harvest in 1896-97 was a failure, only 7-98 inches of rain being registered in Bushire during that period. Instead, therefore, of grain being exported, there was not snfficient to meet the requirements of the countries bordering on the Gulf, and large importations of food-stuffs have taken place during the year under report. The famine in India prevented much grain coming from there, and Burma has been the chief source of supply, quantities of rice being imported from that country. In spite of heavy importations, prices went very high, and the comparative Famine Time-, 1871-72. statement given in the margin, will WbeatKrs. 17 to 21 per Hashim maund of 124ft. sllOW that food-stuiLS liaVC COSt mUCll Barley „ io „ 14 „ „ more during the past twelve months Dates :: 10' 12 „ than they did in the famine years of ' During 1897-98. 1871-72. It is a proof of the increase wheat Krs. 21 to 28 per Hasbim maund of 124ft. in prosperity of Bushire during the past Rice 67 ' 40 ' 50 ' !! 25 years, that in spite of these high rates Dates '* 16 23 „ there has not been actual famine, and that it has not been necessary to provide public relief. At one time, however, things looked very bad; the rains did not come as early as usual, and, though there was a fall of some 2*25 inches in December and early part of January, it ceased entirely after the 16th of the latter month. The rain held off, an d the crops were getting yellow and burnt up, while there was no piospec o fodder for cattle, horses, and mules. Early in March the outlook was exceed- inglv eloomv ; but good falls of rain, which have, I am glad to say, been general, on the 9th and again on the 21st March and subsequent days, revived the dying crops, and brought up the grass, sufficiently to ensure a tairly good harvest throughout the south of Persia. Less land had been sown than in ordinary years, and I am doubtful if there will be much giain oi expor , u there will, I am informed, be sufficient to meet local requirements. The ram was too late to do much good in Persian Baluchistan, and there will certainly be much suffering there, as it is the third bad harvest m succession. e ^ - ing of the crops during the past three years, has undoubtedly affected trade. 'When grain was largely exported, imports rose proportionately, and they have languished during the recent bad years. It is to be hope , iowe\ei, worst is now overhand that a period of prosperity is about to commence. If the rainfall during the coming year is normal, it is probabe a ^ ei surplus grain for exportation, and that the money thus obtained will be employed to increase imports.6 admikistkation report on the persian gulf political Quarantine.—Qyx&amp;mntmQ has been enforced during the year against T~ in India infected with plague. The arrangements have been'in the char^ f Surgeon-Captain P. Lumsden, who has carried out liis difficult duties 0 thoroughly satisfactory manner. Quarantine interferes with trade and w'fK the comfort of individuals, and the efforts to evade it are unceasing n Lumsden and those working under him deserve much credit for the 0 ' in which they have enforced the regulations laid down by the Vem^r^ ference, in the face of much opposition. I am glad to say that up to the PnHnJ the year under report no case of plague has occurred in the Persian Gulf or t Maskat.

After a time fome arrangement was arr v^ at, and the men returned to their own quarters. , r oM&gt;eries.—-There was some unrest among the tribes between Shinz and Bushire during the past year, and several robberies occurred on the trade route. Among others was the robbery of the Legation Kossid with desnatcb^ for Bushire, who was attacked at a defile, called the Tang-i-Turkau about 20 miles south of Kazeroon. The bags were taken, and some of tlie contents destroyed, the remainder being recovered. The day after this occurrence the Persian post was also robbed, and the Commandant of the body -guard of the Governor-General of Pars was sent with a small force to arrest t e robbers. It is stated that he failed to arrest the real culprits, and compensation Consular changes.—In November 1897 Dr Kohprf TTa,i«L- ^ i tlT/l 00118 ^^ German y' arrived atBusbire.'

Bryois who took over charge of the Consulate in February 1898 Mv relations with all these gentlemen, and also with Mr. Vanderzee the Cormnl for the IS etherlands, have been most cordial and friendly. ' Changes m the Governorship of Bushire.—There have been numerous anges m the personnel of the Governor of Bushire. When I arrived the Iktedar-us-Sultan was Governor; but in September he was deposed and an Md Xr e S offi Un r g H Wh - Ch th , e f mi , r 1Jan j' 0 '' Commander of the troo^. ers of Mr' (Jr^Ps in Po ' i* 1 ? 06 ! •'!

Nothing of special importance has occurred at Maskafc during the past year. Captain Jieville was Political Agent at the beginning of the year, and went to India on leave, on the ]0th June, at the same time that I relieved Colonel Wilson. Captain Beville obtained an appointment in India, and did not return to Maskat at the end of his leave. Surgeon-Lieu- tenant-Colonel Jayakar held charge of the Political Agency from the departure of Captain Beville to the arrival of Major Eagan on the 15th September. I visited Maskat twice during the year under report, first in June 1897, when I was on my way to Bushire, and again in January 1898. On the first occasion I did not land, as there was at the time quarantine agaicst arrivals from Karachi; but at the second visit I spent some days on shore, and had several interviews with His Highness the Sultan. Major Ea^an, the Political Agent, has drawn up a report on Maskat affairs for the past year, which accompanies as Part II of this compilation, and as it contains an account of everything of importance tiiat has occurred, it seems unnecessary to recapitulate his observations here. 3.—OMAN —PIRATE COAST. In September a severe storm caused the loss of many lives at the pearl fisheries, and it is reported that about 100 fishing boats were wrecked. There has been a rise in the price of pearls owing to the fact that the take was less than usual. The reason for this has not yet been given. There was some alarm felt in consequence of the movement of the Chief of Abu Dthabi; but nothing important occurred. During the summer several fires broke out at Debaye, and the people became alarmed, fearing a repetition of the disastrous conflagrations which had occurred during the previous year 0 A slave woman was, however, caught in the act of firing a house, and confessed that she was doing it at the instigation of a relation of the Chief. Small-pox was very prevalent on this coast during a portion of the year. In April 1897, the Mutaserrif of El-Hasa invited the people on the Katr Coast to join in a general contribution collected on behalf of the Turkish Government towards the expenses of the Turko-Greek war ; but Sheikh Jasim bin Thani replied that the people could not afford to pay anything towards it. 4.—bahrein. There have been no changes of importance at Bahrein during the past twelve months. Sheikh Esa has been the Chief, and has continued to enjoy good health. In November he sent his son. Sheikh Hamed, to visit me at Bushire, and in Eebruary I visited the islands, remaining there a few days. In May 1897, the Chief appointed Sheikh Hamed to be Governor of Maharrak, and during my visit to Bahrein he expressed a wish that the British Government would recognise him as his successor, whenever his own death occurs. In September I deputed Mr. Prideaux, the Eirst Assistant Resident, and Mr, Gaskin, Extra Assistant, to visit Bahrein and enquire into various complaints against the British Agent, Agha Muhammad Rahim. There were also complaints of high-handed conduct on the part of some of the Sheikh's officials, which Mr. Prideaux went into, and which the Sheikh disposed of afterwards at my request in a satisfactory manner by punishing the parties concerned.8 administration report on the persian gulf political 5.—NEJD. Muhammad Ibn Rashid, the Amir of Jebel Shammar, died on the 3rd December 1897, after nominating his nephew as his successor. This was after- wards duly accepted by all the Sheikhs and leading men of Nejd. 6.—KOWAIT. Sheikh Mubarek, whose assassination of his brothers is mentioned in last yea^s report, continued to be ruler of Kowait, and has on various occasions received British officers in a friendly manner. The port is a good one, and its situation may make it one of the most important places in the Persian'Gulf in the near future. There were constant rumours of intended attacks on Kowait by the sons of the murdered brothers of Sheikh Mubarek, who were said to have obtained the assistance of various important Arab Sheikhs. Nothing important occurred, however, and Sheikh Mubarek assured the British officers who saw him, that he is strong enough to resist all attacks. 7.—PERSIAN ARABISTAN. The great event of the year in Mohammerah has been the murder of Sheikh Mizzal Khan bin Haji Jaber, the well-known Arab ruler of Arabistan. He was assassinated on the 3rd June, when landing from his boat opposite his own residence at Falin. The actual murderers were three negroes, who are supposed to have been instigated to commit the crime by the Sheikh's cousin Selman bin Mansur, the Chief of the Mohaisin tribe.' It was feared at first that the sudden death of Sheikh Mizzal would give rise to trouble; butnothino- particular has occurred. The Governorship of Mohammerah and of the tribes was assumed by Sheikh Mizzal's brother, Sheikh Khazal, after tribal election, which has subsequently been confirmed by the Persian Government; and he appears to have conducted the Government in a proper manner, avoiding' difficult situations, which at one time seemed likely to arise. The Ala-ud-Dowleh relieved Haji Il-Khani in February 1897, and on his arrival at Shushter proceeded to arrest several men, who had been engaged in the attacks on the premises and caravans of British firms. A general risin® ensued, and would probably have ended badly, but for the timely arrival of some 3,000 Bakhtiaris. With their assistance, the Governor-General was able to subdue the revolt, after twenty days' desultory fighting, in which 25 of the rioters and 5 of the Governor's men are said to have been killed. Ala-ud-Dowleh was succeeded by Saad-us-Sultaneh, Sirdar Akram, who has held the post for the rest of the year. An embargo was put on the export of cereals from Arabistan, as the harvest there had been so bad. This affected British firms, who had given advances to the cultivators, and, after some trouble, an exception was made in favour of the export of sesame seed. The embargo^ still continues in force, but will, I hope, soon be withdrawn, as the harvest in Arabistan has been very good, and the Arabs wish to sell their produce, so as to obtain money to replace the flocks and herds, which perished during the recent drought. In July an attempt was made by the Persian Government to establish a Persian Customs House at Mohammerah, but this fell through in consequence of the opposition of Sheikh Khazal. Owing probably to want, consequent on bad harvests, there has been a considerable amount of crime in Arabistan, and the roads have been unsafe. Complaints have been sent in by British firms, Messrs. Lynch and Messrs. Hotz, complaining of losses sustained. In December 1897, a French exploring party under the direction of M. Jenguir, with whom was Mme. Lampre, ascended the Karun, where they were subsequently joined by M. de Morgan. 8.-FARS AND THE PERSIAN COAST. The Nazim-ud-Dowleh was Governor-General of Fars during the early portion of the past year, and was succeeded in October by His Hoyal High ness the Firman Firma, a near relative of the present Shah.'residency and maskat political agency for the year 1897-98. The failure of the winter rains pointed to a famine, and at one time Bushire was crowded with starving people from the interior. The timely fall of rain in March renewed the hopes of the people, and the harvest has been a good one, though, as less land than usual has been brought under cultivation, the output will be below the average. Had the rain not fallen, an attempt to again destroy the Longitudinal Bench marks at the Telegraph Station would probably have been made. The superstitious idea that these marks in some way control the rainfall still holds good, and it is not improbable that fresh attacks will be made on them when ever the rain holds off. There was a great deal of crime at Bushire and its neighbourhood during the past year. The high prices prevailing and consequent distress were the chief causes of the disorders that prevailed; but they were also fomented by local rival aspirants for power, who wished to discredit each other. Another source of danger to Bushire is the neighbourhood of the Tangistanis, a tribe inhabiting the hilly broken country which lies between the lofty tableland of Iran, and the flat strip of sandy shore between the foot of the hills and the sea. Tan- gistan, as its name implies, consists of a succession of ' Tangs ' or defiles, and is an almost impossible country for regular troops to enter. Sir James Outram forbore to pursue the defeated enemy when they had retreated into this region, after the victory of Khushab, and the thorough conquest of the tribes who occupy it would be a difficult undertaking, especially now that they are gene rally armed with breech-loading rifles. The Tangistanis played an important part in the defence of E-eshire Fort in the campaign of 1856-57, and they have for many years been employed as irregular troops by the Persian authorities. The Malik-ut-Tujar had several in his pay. Towards the close of 1897, Hyder Khan, a Tangistani leader, was deputed to punish Ali Khan, another who had not paid his revenue. Hyder Khan being successful, bis opponent came ^ to Bushire and took 44 Bust' or sanctuary at the Imamzada, a shrine near Heshire. He had a large number of followers with him, and it is said that they committed many of the numerous violent crimes that took place in the early part of 1898. As there were reasons to apprehend that an attack would be made on the Telegraph Station, and on Europeans generally, a small party of ^Bluejackets was landed in March, and were retained till an addition to the Resident's escort of 25 sepoys arrived from Bombay. The position of affairs at Bushire at that time gave rise to some anxiety, as the small garrison had been reduced by the despatch of some 150 regulars to the Makran Coast, and the Governor-General was directed by the Persian Government to send a force from Shiraz to coerce the Tangistani's. After considerable delay some 800 men were sent under the command of the Saeed-us-Sultan, an officer on the staff of the Firman Firma. As this expedition was carried out after the end of the year I propose reserv ing an account of it till later, but it is not out of place to mention heie that the greater part of the troops employed, as well as their commander, have returned to Shiraz, and that little appears to have been effected as far as the punishment of the Tangistanis is concerned. It is satisfactory to be able to report that the Persian Government, afte? much discussion, made good, during the past year, the losses incurred by British Pirms whose property was robbed w^hen in transit to the interior during the troubles which ensued on the assassination of His Majesty the late Shah m 1896. This result is, I believe, chiefly due to the efforts of the British Legation at Tehran, which was then in charge of the Hon'ble Charles Hardinge, during the absence of Sir H. M. Durand. One claim, that of Messrs. Livingstone Muir for £1,000, was pot pressed along with the others, and when Mr. Muir brought it to my notice, I was afraid it was too late. The Legation, however, took it up, and the Persian Government discharged it in full. 9.— PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN. The state of affairs on this Coast has been unsatisfactory for some time, and has been referred to in previous reports. Nominally forming part ol Persia, the littoral, from the entrance to the Gulf to the border ot British B10 administration report on the persian gulf political Baluchistan, is occupied by a number of Baluch clans ruled over by their own headmen. The events of the past year, though exceptional in some respects have passed on the same general lines. There were many causes for discontent.' The rainfall, usually scanty, has either failed entirely during the past three years, or the crops, when there has been rain, have been destroyed by locusts The result has been general and widespread distress. We are interested in the fate of Makran inasmuch as some 258 miles of the land portion of the Indo- European Telegraph pass through it, and there are two important Telegraph stations at Jask and Charbar, which are worked by Englishmen, who have in many instances, their wives and families with them. For the protection of R these stations, and of the line, subsidies • Geh 3,000 have for many years been puid to the local Dushinyari . . . . 1 ,000 Baluch Chiefs,* who have in return, until recently, protected our people and the line in such a manner that danger was never anticipated. Besides the members of the Telegraph Department at Jask and Charbar, there are some British Indian traders carrying on trade at the various small ports, who are entitled to our protection, and these men, along with the employes of the Telegraph Depart ment, have suffered during the recent troubles. 1 have already given the causes for discontent against the Persian rule, to which must be added the prevalent idea that, on the death of His late Majesty the Shah, in 1896, the Persian Government had come to an end, and that the time had come for every one to take what he could lay his hands on. These causes led to the rising against the Persian rule. There does not appear originally to have been any hostile feeling against the English, and I am of opinion that no permanent dislike to us exists among the Baluchis. Last year, however, was one of much excitement in the Muhammadan world, and the Baluchis, who are Sunnis, and proless to regard the Sultan of Turkey as their head, undoubtedly felt the effects of the wave of fanaticism, which passed over the tribes on the North- West Frontiers of British India, The hatred of the Persians and contempt for their authority, followed by exaggerated ideas of the recrudescence of Muham madan power, gave the opportunity for attacks on Europeans and their property, which culminated in the murder, on the 2nd December, of Mr. Graves, the Inspector ot the land line in Persian Baluchistan. Anticipations of plunder no doubt were at the bottom of each particular crime, but the perpetrators would never have attempted to commit them if the condition of affairs had been normal, and it' the prestige of Europeans had not fallen to some extent. It is only necessary for me to refer briefly to the steps which were taken to avenge the murder of Mr. Graves, and to restore order. It was decided from the first that the necessary measures must be taken by the Persians, and that we should only interfere to the extent of establishing the facts of Mr. Graves' murder by a suitable enquiry held on the spot. This was done by me in December 1897, and the enquiry I then made indicated that the murder had been committed by a gang of Kirwanis, a tribe who live near the Rapch river, on the banks of which Mr. Graves was encamped at the time or his death. The evidence I then obtained implicated fivef important t i- Luija*b- ind bin Shahbe g» Kirwanis as having been leaders of the 3.' Shahi Muh^ramluMbin Guibeg, g ail o» and this has since been confirmed 4. Sabair bin Sugumiiah, and s ' by the statements of two of them, who shaiigui bin Yap Muhammad. were captured in April. Of the five men v lose names are given in the margin, one, Malik-hind, was killed on the 5th April in an encounter with a party sent to arrest him. Shahi Muhammad was pu &gt; le y executed at Jask, and Sabair is now in chains at Bushire. The two o ler eac l^ rs are still at large, but the son of Lulla has been captured, and is )eing kept by the Persians as a hostage for his father, who will, I hope, be secured during the coming winter. Though the capture and death of some of ic murderers took place after the end of the official year, it is necessary to re er 0 1 *^ this report, to explain what has been done. The Persian Govern- men sen the gunboat Persepolis soon after the news of Mr. Graves* death was received, with a small force to the mouth of the Hapch, and the Persian mnal, the Darya Begi (Lord of the Sea), remained near the scene of the murder from December till the end of May, when he withdrew, the heat avmg become very trying, and there being no prospect of further results. Ieesidency and maskat political agency for the year 1897-98. 11 myself left the Coast, at the end of December 1897, returning for a few days in April, hut throughout the five months that the Darya Begi and his party were on the Rapch, Mr. Campbell of the Indo-European Telegraph Department remained with him, and carried on the duties of Political Officer. A strong escort, sometimes consisting of Blue-jackets, and sometimes of sepoys from the Marine Battalion, was kept on shore for Mr. Campbell's protection, and was also very useful as a support to the Persians, who would otherwise have certainly withdrawn. The Persian Government arranged that a force should be sent from Kerman, simultaneously with the landing of the Darya Begi and his men on the Coast. Before the murder of Mr. Graves, it had been arranged that I should meet the Asaf-ud-Dowleh, the Governor-General of Kerman, at Charbar in Tebruary, and arrange personally with him for the settlement of the numerous questions which were then pending. When, in December, the state of the country became still more disturbed, the Asaf-ud-Dowleh was ordered to proceed south without delay, with sufficient force to ensure the pacification of the district, and the capture of Mr. Graves'murderers. The Governor-General, however, appears to have delayed and procrastinated, and the time that was allowed to elapse before he reached Bampur, undoubtedly encouraged the disaffected, and seriously hampered the efforts of the Darya Begi. Those who would have thrown in their lot at once with him, if the Persian advance from the north had taken place in good time, became disheartened by rumours that the Governor-General was not coming. The Asaf-ud-Dowleh eventually reached Bampur, but got no further, returning, when the weather got hot, to Kerman. He was able, however, to send one of his officers, General Lutfullah Khan, to join the Darya Begi, and he appears also to have sent out parties to collect revenue. The Governorship of the district was taken away from Husain Khan, who was reported to be captured. This has since been contra dicted, and it is now stated that his son is in the hands of the Persians, who are keeping him as a hostage till Husain Khan has paid up a heavy fine. Hu sain Khan's rival, one Mauladad Khan, has been made Governor in his place, and it is probable that his power has now been broken. Next cold weather should see the complete restoration of order in Persian Baluchistan. The operations against the Kirwanis were somewhat slow and protracted, and the tribe might perhaps have been punished more speedily if the British parties on shore had been allowed to undertake offensive operations. This would, how ever, have relieved the Persians of the responsibility, which undoubtedly attached to them, and would probably have led to serious complications, out of all proportion to the advantages to be gained by a speedy punishment of the Kirwanis. I am of opinion, too, that the display of force which we made, and the long retention of our troops on the Makran Coast will have a much more lasting effect than any hasty expedition into the interior would have had. As it is, the hostile Baluchis have suffered far more from the prolonged resi dence of the combined force at Rapch, than they would have done had an at tempt been made to follow the murderers into the hills ; and they are now aware we can easily land troops whenever we wish to punish them, should they dare again to interfere with our people. I do not anticipate any further serious troubles on the Makran Coast; but it is desirable to maintain for the present a small force at Jask and Charbar for the protection of British subjects. It is worthy of notice that the Telegraph line between Jask and Charbar was never touched, though in British Baluchistan several miles were wrecked when the rioting occurred there. In February, Captain Sykes, Consul for Kerman, was sent to meet the Asaf-ud-Dowleh, with the object of urging him to expedite his movements. Captain Sykes went from Bunder Abbas, but failed to join the Asaf-ud-Dowleh, as his health gave way, and he decided therefore to return to the^ sea without completing his mission. He eventually arrived at Charbar eaily m April. 10.—SLAVE TRADE. There have been no important captures of slave-carrymg vessels during the past year ; but some minor transactions have been br ^ u |^ ^ dealt with. The question of the employment of Prench fla 0 s by B Z12 administration eepoet on the persian gulf political vessels is still under consideration. Three slaves took refuge in the Bushire Residency, of which one was manumitted, while the claims of the other two are still under consideration. 11.—PIRACY. Three acts of piracy in the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab took place in May. The victims were Kowait boats, from one of which goods and cash to the extent of Krans 17,000 (equivalent to about Rs. 5,500) were carried off and a member of the crew was killed. In September when the Lawrence was in the Shat-el-Arab, information of an act of piracy on the high seas, near the entrance of the river, was received. The pirates were captured and were made over to the Persian authorities, all the parties being Persian subjects. The pirates received six mouths' imprisonment, and their boats and effects were sold, the proceeds being handed over to the injured persons who had been badly wounded. An outward bound Kutch sailing boat was attacked and plundered in the Shat-el-Arab in December between Eao and Mohammerah. Two of the crew were killed. 12.—ROYAL NAVY. During the early part of the year Her Majesty's steamer the Sphinx Commander Baker, was the only man-of-war in the Gulf. In June, the Fig eon, Lieutenant-Commander Mowbray, passed up the Gulf to Basrah where she remained almost continuously till December when she proceeded to the Makran Coast, and landed a party who took part in the expedition made with the object of investigating Mr. Graves' murder. The Figeon was subsequently put on duty connected with the suppression of the traffic in arms, and eventually went to Bombay. The Sphinx as usual went to Maskat and Kas-al-Had for the summer, and in November left the Gulf for Bombay where she remained, undergoing annual repairs, till January 1898. Besides the Sphinx and the Pigeon, the Cossack, Commander Fraser. the Commander Martin, and the Lapwing, Lieutenant -Commander r, were employed at various times during the winter on duties under the general direction of the Resident in the Persian Gulf. The Lapwing, as already nohced m this report, effected the capture of the arms and ammunition on loam tlie Baluchistan, and has in consequence been almost entirely employed ' m the neighbourhood of Maskat, outside the actual limits of the Persian (jrUli. 13.—OFFICIAL CHANGES.

The past year has not been productive of any evpnts of import ance in the political history of Oman Political. and there are fewer inter-tribal disturb ances than usual to record. The gen eral quiet has been brought about by the excessive price in food-stuffs which has had the effect of engendering a general desire for peace and a fuller appreciation of the advantages of free gifts of food-stuffs from the Suitan. In May rumours were current of unrest amongst the Beni Ruwaheh and Beni Jabir fomented by Sheikh Rashid, the Sultan's Wali at Semail, who, for purposes of his own, was endeavouring to set these tribes against one another. Quiet was, however, restored. In June a disturbance occurred at Nakhl, Sheikh Khalfan bin Thenayan, a very troublesome personage, being the aggressor. Eifty men were despatched with the Wali of Barka to restore order and to arrest Khalfan bin Thenayan, but the latter evaded capture by flight and has hitherto succeeded in retain ing his liberty, notwithstanding several attempts to effect his capture. In December the Beni Ruwaheh attacked Seyma, a place belonging to the Beni Hadram and took it with a loss to the defenders of three men killed and six taken prisoners. On hearing the news Sheikh Rashid bin Ilzaiz, Wali of the Semail, interceded between the parties and succeeded in effecting the restoration of Seyma to the Beni Hadram. Suleiman bin Suweilim, the Governor of Dhofar, arrived at that place on the 15th April and took over charge of Dhofiir - his duties. In April and May, two bodies of men belonging to His Highness's gar rison at Dhofar, numbering in all about 45 men, deserted and returned to Maskat. Shortly after Suleiman bin Suweilim's arrival at Dhofar in April 1897, the inhabitants of Hafa attacked those of Salala with the result that one of the Al Kathir was killed. In this affair Suleiman favoured the inhabitants of Hafa, and was strongly suspected of being the instigator of the quarrel between the parties. On the matter being reported to the Sultan, His High ness sent letters via Bombay and Aden recalling Suleiman and appointing Seyyid Seif bin Yarab as Governor in his place. Suleiman did not obey the order of recall till the end of Eebruary, and when he did so, he brought back with him the Sultan's nominee, Seyyid Seif bin Yarab, and left his Nubian slave, Noobie, an illiterate and abso lutely worthless individual, to act as Wali in his place. In November 1897j the Wali's nephew and an Arab who accompanied him, were attacked and killed by the Kara hillmen. In May 1897, an attempt was made by the Sultan to insist that all bags of rice imported into Maskat should be GeDeral&lt; of one uniform weight. As such an order was calculated to hamper trade and to benefit nobody, the matter was represented to His Highness who revoked this order. On the 21st June, the Jubilee, in commemoration of the completion of the 60th year of the reign of Her Majesty the Queen-Empress, was duly celebrated. All the foreign representatives offered their congratulations on the occasion, and the heads of the Khoja and Banian communities testified their loyalty to Her Majesty. In August 1897, the Officer in Political Charge of the Makran Coast for warded a petition from the British Indian traders at Gwadur, representing \16 ADMINISTRATION REPOET ON THE PERSIAN' GULF POLITICAL that an attempt was being made by the Sultan to levy exorbitant taxes on the fish yards owned by them, and suggesting that the taxes should be reduced by two-thirds. Personal enquiries made by me on the spot showed that the complaints of the owners of the fish-yards were well founded, and that the taxes which it was sought to levy were out of all proportion to the profits made by these individuals, some of whom had already closed their yards in consequence of its imposition. On the matter being represented to the Sultan, His Highness was at first indisposed to make any change, but ultimately he was induced to agree to the proposed reduction. In January 1898, the Sultan agreed to co-operate with the British and Persian Governments in the suppression of the illegal importation of arms into Persia and British India and issued a proclamation on the 13th of the ssme month authorizing British and Persian vessels of war to search, in Maskat waters, vessels carrying the flags of the British, Persian, and Maskat Govern ments, and confiscate arms and ammunition found in them intended for Persian and British Indian ports. The Political llesident in the Persian Gulf visited Maskat in June in the R. I. M. S. Lawrence, and again in January in the same vessel. The quarantine imposed by His Highness the Sultan of Maskat on account of the prevalence of plague in Bombay and Karachi, remained in force through out the year. It was reduced to five days in June, but in consequence of the recent recrudescence of plague at Karachi, it was again increased to eight days. The measure was effective and kept the disease out of the country. The tide-gauge which was erected in February 1893, was dismantled in March by Mr. Belcham, the Extra Assistant Superintendent, Survey of India Department. In August 1897, a collision occurred between the Bombay and Persia Marine. Steam Navigation Company's steamer Mobile and an Arab dhow from Sur which resulted in the latter being sunk. All hands were saved by the boats of the Mohile. The owner of the dhow brought an action against the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, but the enquiry showed that the accident was caused by the negligence of the Nakhoda in not takin'- the ordinary and proper precautions to avoid such an accident. The following men-of-war visited MaskatH. M. S. Redbreast, Pigeon, Navy. Sphinx, Lapwing, and Cossack. The Indian Government Telegraph steamer Patrick Stewart also visited Maskat with Mr. Ffinch, the Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Tele graphs, on board. Foreign Navies were represented by the Prench gun-boat Gahes. During the year 43 fugitive slaves took refuge in the Consulate. Of these Slave Trade, 3 . 4 were freed under the Treaty stipula tions of 1873, and the rest dismissed, not being entitled to freedom. Commanders Baker of H. M. S, Sphinx and Carr of H. M. S. Lapwing&gt; liberated, respectively, under the Brussels Conference Act, 3 and 5 slaves who had taken refuge on board the vessels under their command. In July, the Residency Agent at Lingah was directed by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to send to this Consulate two Africans from the Batineh who had taken refuge at the Lingah Agency and who had been kid napped by two Arabs. The Arabs made their escape on their way to Maskat, and the Africans who could identify them having also absconded on arrival at M askat, the case was allowed to drop. Ihe long standing case of the seven Africans which gave rise to volu minous correspondence was brought to a close by the release of the three surviving Africans, one ol whom, by name Saadu, elected to return to Africa; while the other two, named Seyanoo and Juma, elected to settle in Maskat.

As anticipated in last year's report, trade to and from the Gulf lias not been as flourishing in 1897 as in recent previous 3 7 ears. In spite, however, of a recrudescence of the plague in India and a poor harvest in Southern Persia, due to a very scanty rainfall, the year shows an improvement on 1896 to the extent of an increase of 1173,23,602 in imports and of R2,41,432 in exports. The poorness of the spring harvest in 1897 compelled people to resort early in the year to the stores of grain preserved in underground granaries from pre vious years, and, when these were exhausted, food-stuffs had to be imported from India and Basrah. Prices of food-stuffs in August and September were higher than they are remembered to have been in any former year, and when during the latter months of the year, rain persistently held off, fears were generally entertained that a worse famine than that of 1871-72 was inevitable. These fears have since fortunately been dissipated by the excellent rainfall which occurred in March 1898; and the harvest is reported to be good, though less land than usual has been brought under cultivation. The old-established shipping companies, the British India, the Bombay and Persia, and the Anglo-Arabian and Persian Gulf, had the field to them selves in the Persian Gulf throughout the year, and with the exception of a short interruption in the service of the first mentioned, consequent on a strike amongst its officers, on the eastern run, all three services worked very regu larly. 0 The new German firm alluded to in last year's report, which trades under the name of Deutsch-Persische Hacdels-Gesellschaft, continued its operations at Bushire throughout the year, besides starting Agencies at Shiraz and in one or two of the lesser ports in the Persian Gulf. Many merchants and manufacturers in Germany and Belgium have com menced soliciting orders from the Persian traders, and their eagerness to afford f icilities will probably sooner or later open up fresh lines of commerce, though for the year under report, the competition thus offered has not been seriously felt by the old-established firms here. The deputation of I)r. Hauck, formerly of the German Legation at Tehran, as Consul in Bushire, to institute a German Vice-Consulate here, is sio-nificant of the endeavours to expand her trade which Germany has lately be^un to make all over the world. A small native banking establishment, conducted entirely by Persian merchants, and with a capital of £20,000 in shares, opened this year under the style of the Bushire Trading Company. Similar institutions have also been started in Shiraz, Ispahan and Tehran, and it is claimed for these companies by their supporters that they have rendered important services to the general public. The Imperial Bank of Persia is, however, strongly protesting against their existence, on the ground that they infringe the concession made to the Bank. . Towards the close of 1897, the prospects for the present year seemed decidedly gloomy. The sowing season, which commences in November, opened under such unfavourable circumstances as a heavy mortality amongst the cattle and plough animals, scarcity and high prices of seed, impoverishment of the cultivators, and tardy and scanty rain. Added to this were the misfortunes of internecine quarrels, and the loss by shipwreck of many able-bodied men who had gone to Basrah on the annual mission to purchase dates for the year's con^ sumption, and for distribution amongst the peasantry. The removal of theseeesidency and maskat political agency for the year 1897-98. 19 persons in such a sudden way must, along with other causes I have mentioned, have materially diminished the extent of the area placed under cultivation in the districts to which they belonged. Later on, however, favourable reports were received from the interior of the good done to the crops by the late heavy fall of rain, and of the prospect of a good harvest in consequence. In spite, therefore, of the fact that the opium crop is not likely to be a large one, and that fruit-trees, particularly almonds, have been damaged by frost and locusts, there is reason to hope that the volume of trade in 1898, if hardly up to nor mal standard, will show a great improvement upon the year under report. Imports. Arms and ammunition. —This trade was carried on unchecked until the beginning of December when the Persian Government suddenly announced its intention to stop it once and for all, and, in consequence thereof, proceeded to enforce the prohibition, which has existed since 1881, by seizing and confis cating every rifle and cartridge which could be found for sale in its seaport towns and territorial waters. Although the importation of arms was carried on for only about eleven months of the year under report, the imports nevertheless showed an increase over the whole'previous year's figures of about two lakhs of rupees, thus show ing how rapidly it was increasing. OawcZ/es.—There was a general falling off of the demand for this article, due to the dearness of living, and transactions in it consequently resulted in loss to the importers. Coff ee . —The use of coffee is said to be dying out in Persia, and the little trade done in it resulted in loss. Dearness of the staple food-stuffs also contri buted to diminish the demand during the past year, with the result that the decrease of the import has been about 18 per cent, as compared with the pre vious year. Cotton goods. —Transactions in the interior on the whole are said to have been unremunerative, but in the seaport towns a profit of about 10 per cent, is reported to have been made on imports, the value of which exceeded that of 1896 by nearly 50 lakhs of rupees. Drugs and Medicines. —There was a good deal of sickness in the interior, notably at Shiraz, where influenza and fevers were very rife and caused many deaths. Consequently imports, influenced by demand, increased about 20 per cent, and trade in these articles was very lucrative, profits recorded being 10 to is' per cent, The condition of the market, however, at the close of the year leaves the prospect for 1898 somewhat unfavourable. Glass and qlass-ware.—^hv total import shows a small increase, owing to a demand having arisen in Lingah and Bunder Abbas, where there was none before. In Bushire the demand has considerably decreased. Gold lace and thread.—Iv&amp;te in this line is still feeling the competition noticed in last year's report, viz., the introduction from the north ot a better class of goods and the increase, therefore, over the figures of 1896 is haidly appreciable. . Hardware and Cutlery .—There was a decline of R25 ) 200 in the value of these goods, due to dearness of food-stuiTs. Indiqo. —Calcutta indigo is said to be getting into disfavour, and cheaper sorts are being sought after, more suitable for supplying the wants of the country The trade! however, has revived considerably from the depression caused in the previous year by the Indian famine, and the imports show an increase valued at B2,72,102 over 1896. Matches. —The decrease in the import of this article was due to the supply of last year having exceeded the demand. n , , Metals. —Tbe imports only show a S m al l in c i- e ase over tV|Os^ of ^ ^ but the trade is reported to have been generally profitable and moie esp .y in yellow metal sheets for which an increasing demand exists.20 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN gulf political Oil, Kerosene. —The clearness of food-stuffs is probably the cause of the falling off in the import of this article. Shipments made direct from Russia are said to have been more profitable than those from India. Porcelain and China-ware. —The money returns of these wares show a further improvement of a few thousand rupees orer the figures of the previous year 3 and it seems clear that importers, having been induced in 1898 to import less of the cheap Indian and more of the more expensive and better European article, have now realised the fact that better business can be done in the latter. English and Continental makes are getting more into favour, and have pushed their way even as far as Tehran, competing there with Russian goods Imports from China have at the same time as those from India materially decreased. Frovisions and Stores. —The value of the import of these articles has been almost as great as in 1896, and 1J lakhs greater than in 1895. Enormous • Calcutta .„d quantities of rice have been imported into -Bushire from India,* showing that the cause of the abnormal import was the failure of the harvest in Persia. Sugar, loaf. —The figures this year show a large increase of nearly three lakhs of rupees in value over the previous year. The imports from Erance and Germany, however, are reported not to have afforded much satisfaction or profit. Sugar, soft. —There has been a large falling-off in the import this year probably due to the inability of the poor classes, the principal buyers, to' indulge largely in its use. The trade in Mauritius sugar was less satisfactory than that in the German article which is imported via London and Bombay. Tea. —The import of this article was smaller in value than in 1896 by R9,58,980. The reason is the same as that given in the case of sugar (soft). Timber and Wood. —The demand continues to increase both for Indian and Singapore sorts, and very good profits are said to have been realised in these articles. Woollen Goods. —The figures for 1897 show a further fall of R20 160 beyond those for 1896, but notwithstanding this, the demand is reported to be increasing, and considerable profits were made by importers. The reason fnr the falling-off is the same as that given for 1896. Exports. Horses. There was a considerable fall in this trade during 1896, due to plague and famine in India. This year, on account of the recrudescence of the plague, the market in Bombay was said to be so dull that only 10 horses were exported during the year, and consequently a further fall of R42,870 is recorded. Arms and Ammunition.—The import of these into Bahrein, which used to be etrected through Bushire and the other Persian ports in the Gulf was carried on direct this year; hence the falling off of R59,904i in the exports. ^ Urtller lar ^ e Rl ' 30, ^ 29 ' compared with the figures of loyo, took place m the export of this commodity. This is attributable, partly to the same cause as prevailed in 1896, namely, the poorness of the cotton crop, and partly to the bulk of the produce finding its way to Russia, where better prices are now obtained than in India. Lingah^* ^ Ilcrease ex P or t of dates occurred principally at Almonds.--JlheYz was a slight increase in the export of this commodity, but prices realised were said not to be good, as the demand in India was sman. Wheat, There was an entire absence of export of this grain from Bushire, and the increase of the export from Lingahand Bunder Abbas only means that gram was sent from there to other Persian ports, where prices were actuallyeesidency and maskat political agency for the year 1897-98, 21 Gum. Bushire has hitherto been the only port from which this product has been exported, but favourable markets in England and India not only induced an export from Bushire of more than double that of the previous year but also encouraged shipments from Lingah. The advance recorded amounts to over a lakh of rupees, and considerable profits were realised, both on local sales and on shipments. Hides and There was a rise in the exports of these articles amount- ing in value to about 1138,923. Opium. —The decrease in the export is due to a poor crop. Rose-water.—'Yhz demand for this article fell considerably in India, proba bly on account of the recrudescence of plague. Shells. —Export this year exceeded that of 1896 by El,21,102, and the trade again proved exceptionally remunerative, in spite of the wages paid to the divers beinsr raised in rates. This is a trade in which European and the better class of Persian merchants hesitate to engage, the persons concerned in it being notorious for their fraudulent practices. Silk. —The slight fall in the export of this article was due to the recrudes cence of plague in India. Tobacco. —The heavy fall in the export of this commodity is said to be due to the opposition of the priesthood of Persia, who regard with disfavour the monopoly held by the ' Societe de Tombac ' from the Persian Government. Wool. —A large increase of this article, worth 51,17,849, has been exported, but as shipments to the United Kingdom are said not to have been profitable, it is hardly likely that the rate of increase will be maintained. Carpets. —A bad market in Egypt prevented large exports being made, and a fall of B1,04,584 j resulted. Miscellaneous. Exchange. —Sterling exchange stood at Krans 61J at the commencement of the year, and fell gradually to Krans 56J, which figure it reached in October. It rose again to Krans 531 in November, and at the close of the year it was 55 Krans. Exchange between rupees and krans fluctuated more than in the previous year. Opening at Krans 320 to the RlOO, the rate rose in August to Krans 345, and still continuing to rise, at the close of the year was Krans 355 to RlOO. Mule hire. —This was fairly moderate and steady throughout the year. It opened at the rate of Krans 80 per load, and excepting a fall in March and April to Krans 65, the rates ranged between Krans 80 and 95 till the close of the year, when they stood at Krans 105 per load. Freights. —Freights to London ruled at 25s. per ton throughout the year except in May when they fell to 23s. and 22s. Qd. Shipping. —The shipping trade of the year under review shows a small decrease when compared w 7 ith the figures of 1896, and a considerable decrease on 1895. Ninety-three steam vessels, aggregating 101,394 tons, entered the port of Bushire, a very great majority of which carried the British flag. M. J.

The total trade for the year is returned at $5,372,000 as against $4,788,800 for the preceding year, showing an increase of $583,200. The returns including specie show an increase of $658,000 in imports as compared with the figures of the previous year 0 With the exception of a slight decrease under the head of piece goods, almost every head shows a remarkable increase; rice from India and arms and ammunition from the United Kingdom and France contributing chiefly towards it. In the case of exports, although dates, fruit, fish, etc., show an increase there is a remarkable decrease under the heads of cloth and salt, and a con siderable fall under the head of specie which is due to the fall in exchange of dollars. ' 0 The customs were farmed by Shett Rattansee Purshottam for $1.: 5,000 but a fortnight before the expiration of the annual contract the customs were sold to a ring of Cutchee Banians for $140,000. A week afterwards, however they reverted to Rattansee for the sum of $170,000 which amount was sub sequently reduced to $140,000 in consequence of the anticipated loss to the customs from the agreement made between the British, Persian, and Maskat Governments for the suppression of the export of arms and ammunition from Maskat to Indian and Persian ports, C.
