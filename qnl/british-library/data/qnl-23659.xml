RESOLUTION. Delhi, the Ist April 1926. No. F.-276-EX./25.— Different rules are at pre sent in force prescribing rates of exchange to be applied in converting sterling overseas pay into rupees for different purposes. The Government of India have now decided to prescribe one uniform rate for all cases, so far as this is pos sible. Except, therefore, in the case of the cal culation of average emoluments for pension, which is still under consideration, the current rate of exchange, as defined in Article 343 Account Code, will hereafter be adopted for con version for all purposes. The same rate will be employed in determining whether any maximum laid down in rupees for the pay of any post, part of which is drawn in sterling, is exceeded. 2. These orders will take effect from 1st April 1924 for the purpose of calculating compensatory allowances, and in all other cases from the 1st April 1926.

W. 1, , 1936. Indian Military Service Family Pension Scheme. ^ Madam ' I am directed to forward for your information a copy of a Report by Sir A. W. Watson, K.C.B., on the valuation of the Indian Military Service Family Pension Scheme as at 31st March 1934. 2. In Mav 1933 a circular, a copy of which is enclosed, was addressed to all subscribers asking their views on a proposal for the gradual transfer of the balance of the fund into the custody of Trustees. The arrangement contemplated was that there should be handed to the Trustees annually all contributions and interest received during each year, the pensions payable being met i r o m balance accumulated from past subscriptions. The effect would be that the balance in the hands of the Government of India would gradually disappear, and after a certain period the entire fund would be in the hands of the Trustees, who would thereafter be responsible for finding the sums required to meet the pen sions due. 3. A large majority of the replies received from subscribers indicated a de sire for the investment of their balances in sterling securities. A Note embo dying with certain modifications, the proposals of the circular, was accordingly submitted bv the Secretary of State to the Joint Select Committee on Indian Constitutional Reform. The Committee in its report to Parliament recom mended the inclusion in the India Bill of a clause on the lines proposed. Copies of the Note to the Committee, of the Committee's reommendation and of the resulting section of the Act as finally passed, are enclosed for your information. 4. It will be observed that the provisions of the Act differ in certain important respects from the proposals contained in the circular of 1933. It was con templated in the circular that the transfer to sterling securities would be effected by a process dependent on the actual payment of pensions, which, it was estimated, would require for completion some 15 to 20 years. In consequence of a desire expressed by many subscribers for a more rapid transfer, it was pro posed in the Note to the Joint Select Committee that this scheme should be abandoned and one substituted whereby the transfer should be effected by such instalments as were permitted by the financial conditions, but subject m any case to completion within 12 years. As a result of careful consideration m the ** Committee it was suggested that the operation might be completed within a much shorter time, and the Act now provides for transfer within three years of the 1st April 1936, subject, however, to the provision that this period may be extended by Order in Council should it seem advisable, owing to a change m the financial conditions or for any other reason, to prolong it. 5. Tt will further be seen that whereas the proposals contained in the circu lar contemplated that if a majority of subscribers were in favour of the transfer of the balances to Trustees this decision would be binding on the minority, the Act provides that every subscriber and beneficiary shall have the option of re maining under the existing conditions. The probable effect will be to divide the fund into two independent portions, part remaining as at present in the balances of the Government of India and part transferred to the Trustees. A pension scheme, the membership of which is small, tends to be seriously affected by l15fmdaccidental fluctuations in the rate of mortality or in other contingencies affect ing its financial position ; with the consequence that unless a large reserve is kept against such accidents, the rates of benefit become liable to frequent alterations of inconvenient magnitude. In order to avoid the drawbacks of such a position in the event of the numbers electing to continue under the Qxist- ing arrangements being a comparatively small proportion of the whole, the Act grants to the Secretary of State a discretionary power to terminate the exist ence, as an independent financial entity, of the portion of the fund allocable to subscribers and pensioners who elect to remain under the present conditions. The process would be as follows. As soon as the balance, membership and other particulars relating to this reduced fund were known, a valuation would be made of its assets and liabilities with a view to ascertaining the maximum bene fits which it might be expected to produce. Thereafter no further valuations would be made, and the amounts of the benefits and subscriptions would not be subject to any variation, but benefits of the ascertained amount would be defi nitely guaranteed as charges against the revenues of India, while the accumu lated^ funds would lapse to the Government of India in consideration of the liability it was undertaking. Recourse to this measure will not, however, be had unless the results of the election show that it is advisable in the interests of the beneficiaries concerned. (i. It will be seen on reference to the attached copy of section 273 of the Government of India Act that its provisions must be brought into operation by means of an Order by His Majesty in Council, which under section 309 of the Act can be made only in pursuance to an Address of both Houses of Parliament. A copy of the draft Order which was laid before Parliament on the 21st April 1936 Ys enclosed. The date on which a motion will be made in Parliament for an Address to the Crown has not yet been settled ; but any representations to the Secretary of State relating to the terms of the draft Order which it may be desired to make [see last paragraph of subsection (1) of section 273] should reach the India Office not later than 20th June 1936. The further procedure, after Parliament has approved the terms of an Order and it has been made by His Majesty in Council in pursuance of the Address from Parliament, will be as follows : As soon as possible following the making of an Order a notification that it has been made will be sent to each subscriber and beneficiary. Under subsection (3) of section 273 of the Act the Order must provide that any subscriber or beneficiary who wishes to remain subject to the existing pondi- tions may make objection to the vesting in the Commissioners of the portion of the fund representing his interests ; and the notification will draw attention to the manner in which and the date by which such objection may be lodged, as laid down in the Order. It is desirable that an indication of the wishes of each persons concerned should be given; hut it must he dearly understood that, in accordance with the terms of the Act, any person who does not express an objec tion to transfer hy the appoined time will he deemed to have assented to the vesting of his or her interest in the Commissioners. 7. The pensions payable under the Regulations are at present being issued at rates 50 per cent, higher than those originally provided. Of this increase, half, or 25 per cent, of the original rates, is permanent and half temporary ; the significance of these terms being that, whereas under the Regulations any reduc tion necessary to maintain financial equilibrium may be made in the rates of pension to be'granted in future, pensions actually in issue may only be reduced to the extent to which they are declared to be temporary. In paragraph 7 of his Report the Government Actuary estimates that the surplus shown by^ the valuation is sufficient to raise the permanent portion of the increase to 45 per cent, of the original rates, leaving 5 per cent, only in temporary form ; and to continue for five years this remaining portion of the increase ; and to provide a substantial reserve for its further continuance. It may reasonably be antici pated, therefore, that unless the rate of interest falls below 4 per cent. &gt; the future rate of pensions under the existing arrangements would be maintained at the present level, that is to say, 50 per cent, above the original rates. 8. In paragraph 10 of his Report Sir A. Watson states the revised rates of pension which may be expected in the case of subscribers and pensioners who elect for transfer. It will be seen from the tables immediately following that, as was clearly inevitable, these pensions are of lower amount, ranging from a level 15 per cent, above the original rate to a maximum of 40 per cent, above that rate.4 From age 6 From age 12 Unmarried under ige 6. to age 12. to age 21.

It must be emphasised that these forecasts are not to be interpreted as a definite statement of the amounts which will ultimately be payable. Such a statement is in the nature of things impossible in the case of any fund organised on a mutual basis. It could be made, in the case of subscribers and beneficiaries who express objection to transfer, if it were decided to put into operation the measures referred to in the laitter portion of paragraph 5 of this circular. So long, however, as the two portions of the fund retain their independent financial status, the results must in each case depend on the actual experience in respect of the determining factors, the rates of mortality and marriage and the rate of interest. The latter, in particular is difficult to predict with any degree of accuracy and it is desirable that the effects, in each case, of future changes in the rates should be made clear. 10. Under the present arrangements the capital of the fund, which is repre sented by an obligation of the Government of India, is not liable to appreciation or depreciation. The rate of interest is fixed by the Secretary of State in Council, and follows broadly the movements of the yield on long-term India sterling debt. The rate at present allowed is 4 per cent. ; and it has been assumed in the calculations that this rate will be continued in the case of the fund attributable to persons who register objection to transfer. It must be understood, however, that no undertaking as to the continuance of this rate can be given. The present level of India loans, if maintained, will make it neces sary to consider the lowering of the rate, and the effect might be a reduction in the rates of pension payable. It may, however, be observed that, under the rules, pensions actually in issue cannot be reduced in the case of pensioners who remain under present conditions except to extent of any portion declared to be temporary. Conversely if the course of the stock markets justified an increase in the rate of interest, profits would accrue which might make an increase in the rates of pension possible.11. In the case of the fund attributable to subscribers and beneficiaries who elect for transfer the rate of interest earned will for many years be determined, not by the level of security prices from time to time current, but by the level prevailing when the initial investment is made. Assuming the investment to be made in stocks with a long currency, say 20 years or more, the yield will to a great extent be stabilised at the figure corresponding to the initial cost of the various investments. Subsequent changes in market conditions which enable a higher rate to be obtained will not benefit the fund, at least so far as its original amount is concerned ; for the money necessary to take advantage of the improved buying conditions can onh 7 ' be obtained by selling the existing in vestments at a loss. It is true that, if the fund is a growing one, the investment of yearly excesses of income over expenditure would gradually raise the rate of interest obtainable on the whole. On the other hand, if the fund should prove to be a declining one, it would be necessary to provide for the sale of invest ments at a loss. Should future rates of interest tend to fall, these results would, of course, be reversed. It would be possible to avoid both the fixation of the rate and the adverse consequences of future changes in capital values by investing in securities of comparatively short currency. The yield now obtainable on such securities is, however, small, and in the absence of any certainty a-s to the prospects of rein vestment when the securities mature the sacrifice of income would be difficult to justify. 12. The above observations will perhaps make it clear that any estimate of the future must necessarily be tentative and subject to revision ; and that this is more particularly the case in regard to that part of the fund which will be vested in Commisisioners. In view of this uncertainty it is not contemplated that the reductions foreshadowed in the rates of benefit as a result of the transfer will be made at the outset. That some reduction in benefits will be necessary is clear : but the extent of this reduction can only be assessed with any approach to accuracy when the decisions of subscribers and beneficiaries have been made, the nature of the future liabilities ascertained, and the appropriate funds invested by the Commissioners. The last-named operation must under the Act be completed by 31st March 1939, and it may not be, therefore, until after that date that final rates of benefit, which, though in the nature of the case they must be liable to reconsideration, will have some prospect of permanency, will be determined. Meanwhile, as a provisional measure, all pensions in course of payment whose recipients elect for transfer, or becoming payable to the dependents of subscribers who have elected for transfer, will be reduced by 10 per cent, of the original rates. For instance, the pension of a widow in Claps III, now paid at the rate of £100 with 50 per cent, increase, or £150 in all, will ■be reduced to £140 ; and proportionately in other cases. Some loss to the fund must be occasioned by this course. There is, however, an offset to this loss in the higher rates of interest realised on the balances up to the date of invest ment ; and the results should therefore not be serious. 13. In the case of subscribers and pensioners who express objection to transfer, it would theoretically be possible to adopt the suggestion made in para graph 7 of the Government Actuary's Report ; since the balance of assets and liabilities is not affected by the transfer of a portion of the fund to the Com missioners, and the benefits ascertained to be available on a valuation of the whole fund are therefore available also, as pointed out in paragraph 10 of the Report, to the members of the portion left after transfer. Practical considera tions, however, point to the desirability of postponing the adoption of the measure suggested. It has been explained that in the event of the rate of interest allowed on the balances being reduced, it might be necessaiy to restore equilibrium by a decrease in the rates of benefit ; and that under the rules pensions in course of issue cannot be reduced, except to the extent to ^ which they are declared to be temporary. If so large a proportion of the pensions as is suggested were declared permanent, the effect would bo that practically the whole of any deficit caused by a fall in the rate of interest would of necessity he borne entirely by living subscribers and their dependants. Both for this reason, and because with a smaller fund it is advisable to retain a larger pro portion of the surplus undistributed, it has been decided to make no immediate change in the rates or conditions of pension. The surplus which would other wise have been utilised in increasing the stabilised portion of the pension will, of course, remain as a part of the fund, and will be available for distribution6 after future valuations ; or alternatively, if it should become necessary to ter minate the fund in the manner described in paragraph 5 above, will be taken into account in calculating the fixed pensions payable from the revenues of the Federation. 14. It will perhaps be of assistance to add a word of explanation on a point regarding which some misconception seems to have arisen. Certain subscribers aud beneficiaries have enquired whether, if they elect to remain under the present conditions, their prospects would be in any way affected by variations in the exchange value of the rupee. The answer to this question is that, except to the extent mentioned below, the exchange value of the rupee has no bearing on the position. Apart from the Passage Insurance Branch, the accounts of which are maintained in rupees, the basis of the Fund has always been and will remain a sterling one. The rates of benefit and contribution are expressed in sterling, and the balance of the Fund, so far as it is attributable to persons who express objection to transfer, will remain a sterling liability of the Government of India. The rates of pension payable will be determined in relation to this sterling sum, and will be unaffected by any variation in the value of the rupee. Such variations will react on the individual only in two cases, firstly, if as a subscriber he pays contributions in rupees, and secondly, if a beneficiary being resident in India elects to draw pension in that country. In such cases the rupee equivalent of the prescribed sterling subscriptions or pensions will vary according to the current rate of exchange. It will be appreciated that so far as exchange enters into the matter it does so equally whether the subscriber elects for transfer to the Commissioners or not. 15. With regard to the Passage Insurance Branch it will be seen that the Government Actuary reports a further surplus of considerable amount, from which substantial bonus additions to the sums assured could be made. He re commends moreover that this branch, which has for many years been declining in membership, and which since the introduction of the existing passage re gulations has in fact largely outlived its usefulness; should be closed. It has been decided to accept this recommendation. No further policies will therefore be issued in the branch. The balance at its credit, which is now maintained iii rupees, will be converted into sterling and merged in the main fund, while bonus additions at the rates recommended in paragraphs 13 and 14 of the Report will be made to the sums assured under all existing policies. The sums assured wili be converted into sterling at the rate of Is. 6^. to the rupee and will hence forward be payable in sterling. , It will be noted that the bonusi addition is slightly smaller in the case of those subscribers who elect for transfer to sterling. No separate option is exercisable in respect of passage insurance policies. Subscribers who elect t^ have their pension interest transferred to the Commissioners will automatically come under similar conditions in regard to their passage insurance, if any, amjl vice versa. 16. It has further been decided to accept the recommendation of the Gov ernment Actuary, given in paragraph 15 of his Report, that subscribers shall have the option of converting a passage insurance into a reversionary annuity payable to a wife or daughter. As the cases will be few in number no tables will be published showing the amount of pension which can be secured for a given amount in insurance ; but particulars will be furnished on application to the Controller of Pension Funds at the India Office at any time after the sub scriber has made his election with regard to the transfer of his interests to the Commissioners. The option to convert may be exercised at any time within three months of the date by which, under the Order in Council, objection to transfer must be lodged. 17. Pending the further notification referred to in paragraph 6 above, no reply to this circular is necessary. Any representations, however, which you may desire to make will, of course, receive consideration. I am, Your obedient Servant, S idney T tjener, Controller of Pension Funds.Indian Military Service Family Pension Scheme. Indian Military Widows' and Orphans' Fund. Government Actuary's Department,, Treasury Chambers, Whitehall, London, S.W. 1, 27th January 1936. My Lord Marquess, In compliance with your request, conveyed to me by the Controller of Pension Funds in his letter (No. A.G. 6897|34), dated 24th July 1934, I have made valuations as at 31st March 1934 of the assets and liabilities of the Indian Military Service Family Pension Scheme and of the Indian Military Widows' and Orphans' Fund. 2. I enclose separate reports setting out the results of the respective valuations. Tu order to save repetition of the same matter in the two reports, I propose to embody in this letter such general observations and comments as are applicable both to the Scheme and to the Fund. 3. As a preliminary to the study of the valuation results, it may be of assistance io some of the subscribers to repeat the short general explanation of the significance of a valuation which I gave in my last report. The substance of this explanation is embodied in the Appendix to this letter. 4. It will be recollected that in connection with the last valuation (as at 31st March 1929) an entirely new series of valuation tables was compiled based on the combined experience of the two Funds during the 10 years 1919-29.* As the first step in the present investigation, the experience of the five years 1929-34 was compared in each particular with the ' expectation ' derived from that new basis. I fnfd that the latest experience has diverged, to a greater or less extent, from that of 1919-29, the most noticeable feature being a substantial increase in the mortality-rate of widows. In the case of subscribers and their wives the mortality-rate has fallen to a small extent, and this experience makes the increase in the death-rate of widows the more conspicuous. I have accordingly had to consider whether this latter feature (which has been confined to the four financial years 1930-34, and has been specially marked in the last two of these years) has any particular significance or whether it is nothing more than a fortuity which will be found to have been balanced when figures relating to a longer period are available for comparison. Similar considerations arise, though in much less marked degree, in respect of various minor factors entering into the valuation basis. On the whole I have arrived at the conclusion that the present basis, adopted so recently as 1929, should not be modified until the experience of the quinquennium now running its course is available and the records of a full decade following that of the years 1919-29 csm be brought under examination. I have come to this decision the more readily on finding that, on the whole, the valuation of each Fund on the present basis shows a small profit on the working of the five years 1929-34, after deduction of the interest received in excess of the equivaient of 4 per cent, per annum, which must be regarded as non-recurrent. 5. The valuations with interest at 4 per cent, show the position on the assumption that the existing financial arrangements will continue, i.e., that the balances at the credit of the Scheme and Fund remain in the hands of the Govern ment of India and will receive interest at a rate not less than 4 per cent. In the case of the Widows' and Orphans' Fund the rules make definite provision to this effect. Transfer of Funds to Trustees in Britain. 6. In connection with my instructions for the present investigation the Controller of Pension Funds informed me that certain proposals were under consideration for the transfer of the funds, or part of them, from the Govern- *Tlio rd'crence in all cases is to financial years, e.g., 1919-29 covers the period 1st April 1919 to 31st March 1929.ment of India into the hands of trustees in Great Britain for investment in securities authorised by the Trustee Act. I was requested to examine the probable effect of this proposed arrangement, which by the passage of the Govern ment of India Act has now received the sanction of Parliament. The intention now is, as i understand, to submit preliminary proposals to the beneficiaries and siibscrtbers to enable them to choose whether to remain under the existing conditions or to constitute separate funds by the transference of their reserves to the suggested trustees. If opinion is not unanimous, the proposal involves the separation of the present Scheme and Fund, each into two parts, one section continuing on existing lines and the funds of the other invested by the trustees. 7. Two points at once arise in connection with this proposal. Firstly, the membership in either case is not large, and if this is divided into two bodies, one, or both , of the separate sections may be so small numerically that fluctua tions m mortality and other elements may have an embarrassing effect on the nuances. Secondly, funds invested in trustee securities in London cannot be expected to yield interest at the rates credited by the Government of India, and the capital value moreover will be subject to market fluctuations. The funds as at present constituted have the advantage that, being held by Government virtually on loan, they do not run the risk of capital losses through fluctuations m market values. &lt; 8. It is not possible to give any precise indication of the effect of the first p^int. Generally speaking, if the valuation of a Fund with a small membership shows a surplus, a greater proportion of the surplus has to be reserved for contingencies than is considered necessary in a case where membership is lar o '0 and experience consequently more stable. A deficiency, also, is a more tangible (probability owing to the greater liability to fluctuation, and it follows that a greater degree of caution is necessary in fixing the benefits and contributions. Ihe ertect qi the second point raised in the preceding* paragraph is the main mat (or for preliminary examination at the present stage. The rate of interest at which the valuation of a superannuation or widows' and orphans' pension fund should be made should obviously be such as is likely to be realised on the investments of the fund over a very long period in the future. It is, of course impossible accurately to forecast the future trend of interest rates. But the early transfer of a large capital sum, and its investment in trustee stocks on which only a low yield can be obtained, must necessarily exert a marked influence oif the financial position in the future. After consultation, &lt;the conclusion was arrived at that if the balance at credit of the funds were invested in British stocks the valuations should be made at a rate of interest of 3 per cent., and that rate has accordingly been adopted for the purpose now under consideration. , 9 - regards the other elements (mortality, &amp;c.), the basis is the same as that employed m the valuation at 4 per cent. The results of the valuations at ^ per cent are given m the respective reports and show the great influence which the rate ot interest bears on the finances. .^ ]! e funds to be transferred will, of course, be only such part of the total as is applicable to the subscribers and beneficiaries who take the option to transfer, and tins will not be known until the new conditions have come into torce and Lie option has been exercised. If, however, it be assumed that the whole of the monies of the Scheme and the Fund will be transferred, involvino- adjustments of benefits as a consequence of the change of interest from 4 per cent. to 3 cent., an indication of the revised benefits can be given. Calculations nave, therelore, been made with that purpose. 11. In order to maintain equity among the different classes of persons interested it is necessary to ascertain, in the first instance, what parts of the tunas in liidia are applicable to the several groups of subscribers and benefi- cianes. Avhen the funds have been so apportioned, it can then be ascertained what benefits can be given to each of the several groups on,the 3 per cent, basis. i \ S Ji 0 p . e f e P ara ^ on of the membership into groups is due to the act t lat the change of interest from 4 per cent, to 3 per cent, affects the various groups to a different extent For example, the j^ect of such a reduc- S? mr; 011 i 1 ? 6 va Ji ie an a 8 ,ed widow's pension is trifling compared with the corresponding effect m the case of a young subscriber who normally will contiibute ioi a long period and to whom the Fund is under commitments the fulfilment of which may not begin for many years, and which being of the annuity type, may not be completed until a further prolonged period has elapsed.9 Passage Insurance Branches. 12, The two reports show the respective positions of the subsidiary branches established for the purpose of insuring provision for the payment of expenses connected with the removal from India of the families of deceased officers. The membership of the Passage Insurance Branch of the Family Pension Scheme is, as would be expected, steadily decreasing and on the valuation date the number of members was 71. The corresponding Branch of the Widow's and Orphans 7 Fund has never attracted an appreciable proportion of subscri bers and on the valuation date the membership was only eight. The reason for this lack of -support lies, no doubt, in the changes made some years ago in the general conditions of service of officers in India, with the result that these Branches are no longer necessary for the particular purpose for which they were established. The membership is too small to provide a satisfactory basis for the work ing of an insurance scheme, and since a substantial influx of new members is not likely it is for consideration whether the Branches should be continued in their present form. I understand that the Branches are not regarded as sepa rate financial entities and that it would be permissible to merge the funds with the general balances of the Family Pension Scheme and Widows' and Orphans^ Fund respectively. For the reason indicated above, I recommend that this should now be done on the terms that no further contracts will be issued and a guarantee given to the existing members that in addition to the bonuses added after the valuations of 1924 and 1929 a further and final bonus will be granted at the rates suggested in the present valuation reports. As an alternative to the latter course I suggest that each of the 79 subscri bers to the Passage Insurance Branches should have the option of the conver sion of his full balance in the Branch concerned to the provision of an addition to the,annuity to his widow or daughter(s) as the officer may elect. The amount of the annuity so to be provided would have to be specially calculated in each case, but since.the number of members is small the work involved would not be great. I have the honour to be, My Lord Marquess,. Your Lordship's obedient Servant, Alfred W. Watson, The Secretary of State for India. APPENDIX. The Process of Valuation. For the information of those who are not familiar with the process of valuation the following paragraphs indicate briefly what is the nature of this process, particularly in regard to the undertakings of widows' and orphans' pension schemes. An actuarial valuation consists of an estimation of the present value, on the one hand, of the benefits conferred by the fund, and on the other hand, of the contributions payable in future, the difference between the two sums being the ' net liability ' against which assets accumulated out of past contributions (with interest) should be in hand. The comparison then made between the net liability of the fund and the actual assets in hand determines whether the fund is solvent, and where the assets are the greater of the two amounts the differ ence represents the amount of the surplus. In estimating the present x^alue of the fulure benefits and contributions, it is necessary to have regard to a variety of contingencies, including the mortality rates expected to prevail among the subscribers, their wives (or widows) and their children, the probable marriages and re-marriages among subscribers, marriages of daughters and re-marriages of widows, the probable number of births of children of each sex to subscribers, future promotions in class, and retirements from the service. All of these elements vary with the ages through which the persons con cerned will pass in the future, and at each stage of the calculations appropriate L15FinD10 .assumptions must be made as to the conditions which will prevail in the lon^ period which must elapse until the death of the last surviving , beneficiary under engagements entered into with present or former subscribers. These engage ments may extend over very many years ; to take a simple example, an officer en tering at the age of 23 (which is about the average age at entry of the unmarried entrants) might not marry until he is 40 and may leave at his death a spinster daughter born when he was 43, and who lives unmarried, and, therefore, a pen sioner to the age of 80. As she was not born until 20 years after her father joined the service the contract, beginning with contributions from the member and later taking the form of a pension to the daughter, will have extended over 100 years. The valuation does not take account of the engagements in respect of officers entering the service after the date as at which the valuation is made.11 INDIAN MILITARY SERVICE FAMILY PENSION SCHEME. Report by the Government Actuary on the Valuation as at 31st March 1934. Teeasuby Chambees^ S.W.-l, 27th January 1936. My Lord Marquess, In compliance with your request, I have made a valuation of the assets and liabilities of the Indian Military Service Family Pension Scheme as existing on 31st March 1934. 2. Certain preliminary comments on matters common both to the present valuation and to that which I have made of the Indian Military Widows' and Orphans' Fund are embodied in my letter which accompanies this Report. The valuation has been made upon the basis of the rates of mortality, &amp;c., therein referred too, combined with the alternative assumptions that the funds will in future earn interest at the rate of (a) 4 per cent, or {h) 3 per cent. 3. Tables are given in Schedule A attached showing the changes which have taken place in the numbers of members and of incumbent and contingent bene ficiaries of the Scheme during the five years ending on 31st March 1934. The numbers of subscribers, children, and pensioners on the valuation date were as follows :— Subscribers. Widows. Children. Sons. Daughters. Married. Single. Total. Incumbent. Re-married Incumbent. Contingent. Incumbent. Contingent. 2,931 488 3,419 1,405 187 205 1,376 1,018 2,003 4. The Consolidated Account of Receipts and Expenditure for the five years ending on 31st March 1934 shows that the receipts from subscriptions and dona tions amounted to £456,876. In the previous quinquennial period the corresponding receipts amounted to £527,244. The decrease in income from this source is attributable to the fall in membership, particularly among subscribers on the active list, whose numbers have decreased by 45 per cent. The number of retired subscribers, who pay re duced contributions, increased slightly. Annuities paid amounted in 1929-34 to £1,365 ,028, compared with £1,134,134 m the previous five years, the increase being accounted for by the growth in the number of annuitants and by the fact that, following the last valuation, the addi tion to the basic scales of pension was raised from 25 per cent, to 50 per cent on 1st January 1932. Interest receipts on the balances amounted to £1,537,292 against £1,499,958. The balance at credit of the Scheme on successive valuation dates was as lollows :— 31st March. Increase. £ £ .. 5,103,171 .. 5,982,969 879,798 . • 6,600,370 617,401 There haj&gt; thus been a perceptible slackening in the rate of growth of the .bund, which, from examination of the separate accounts for each vear of the last quinquennium, is particularly noticeable towards the end of the period. In the last year of the quinquennium the pension payments, for the first time in the 1924 .. 1929 .. 1934 ..12 history of the Scheme, exceeded the interest income, the respective amounts bein^ £313,729 and £294,755. Since the rate of interest to be credited to the Fund was reduced to 4 per cent, on 1st January 1935, and the receipts from contributions and donations must continually diminish, it is evident that the time is rapidly approaching when the outgo will exceed the income and the balance at the credit ® Scheme will begin to decrease. This will be the natural result of closing the .bund to new subscribers some 20 years ago, and must not be taken as indica tive of any unsoundness. 5. The result of the valuation on the basis of interest at 4 per cent., of which details are given in Schedule B appended, is as follows :— £ Present value of— Immediate pensions .. .. .. .. _ 3,202 507 Contingent pensions .. .. .. ,. _ 3,106,759 Total liabilities .. .. .. 6,409,266 Present value of future contributions and donations .. .. 815,996 Net liability ... .. .. 5,593,270 Balance in hand on 31st March 1934 as shown by £ the accounts .. .. .. .. 6,600,370 Net credit balance of receipts and payments out standing on 31st March, 1934 .. .. 2,374 Effective balance on 31st March, 1934 .. .. .. 6,602,744 Surplus .. .. .. £1,009,474 In this statement effect has been given to the increases in benefits and reduc tions-iir subscriptions and donations which where granted after the last valua tion. 6. About one-half of the surplus now revealed comprises the balance of the surplus carried forward after the last valuation (£419,000) with its interest accumulations. The new surplus accrued during the quinquennium is therefore about £500,000, of which about 60 per cent, is due to interest credited in excess of the equivalent of 4 per cent, per annum. The various elements (mortality marriages, births, &amp;c.) entering into the working of the Fund have thus produced a net surplus of the comparatively small amount of £200,000. Having regard to the size of the Fund and of its related liabilities, this result would appear to in dicate that the basis of valuation, taken as a whole, accords closely with the finan cial experience of the Scheme. Since the rate of interest to be credited to the Scheme was reduced to 4 per cent, on 1st January 1935 and no further profits can be anticipated from this source, it is not to be expected that surpluses of substan tial amounts will be earned in the future. 7. Of the present total increase in pensions (50 per cent.) 25 per cent, was granted permanently after the last valuation and 25 per cent, is on a temporary basis, ceasing on 31st December 1936. The surplus of £1,009,474 is adequate to enable the present increase to be maintained at the full 50 per cent, for a further live years and to convert a substantial proportion of the temporary increase to a permanent basis. A possible scheme would be as follows :— Cost, as at the valuation date, of— £ (1) Transfer to a permanent basis as from 1st January 1937 of four-fifths of the present temporary part of the pensions 890,000 (2) Temporary continuance from 1st January 1937 to 31st De cember 1941 of the remaining one-fifth of such part of the pensions .. .. .. M ... 48,000 Total .. .. .. £938,00013 A scheme on the above lines would thus stabilise the permanent increase of the basic tensions at 45 per cent, and leave only 5 per cent, on a temporary basis, with a balance of surplus of £71,000 carried forward as a reserve for adverse 'contingencies. As indicated above, it appears inevitable that a comparatively small surplus will be shown by the next valuation. It may, however, be icason- ably anticipated that, unless the future experience turns in a direction uniavour- able to the finances, the Fund will be in a position to continue the full inciease o 50 per cent, in pensions. 8. The foregoing paragraphs deal with the position of the Fund on the assumption that the existing financial arrangements will continue, i.e., that the balance at the credit of the Scheme remains in the hands of the Government of India and is credited with interest at 4 per cent, per annum, the accounts con tinuing to be drawn up in sterling as hitherto. Teaksfee or Fund to Teustees rsr Beitain. 9 The following paragraphs show the position in the event of the Fund, or a portion of it, being transferred to the custody of trustees in Britain. For this purpose another valuation has been made on the assumption of interest at tlie rate of 3 per cent., the basis otherwise beng the same in every particular as that described above. The result of the valuation, as thus revised, is as follows .^5 i ll Present value of— Immediate pensions .. Contingent pensions Total liabilities .. Present value of future ccntiibuticns cxd dcnatxcns Net liability Effective balance in hand on 31st March 1934 Surplus £ 3,646,027 3,838 772 7,484,799 ££6,8C5 6,597,934 6,602,744 £ 4,810 mm fH B Thus the effect of reducing the valuation rate of interest from 4 per cent, to 3 per cent, is to reduce the surplus from £1,009,474 to the nominal sum or £4,810. 10. If the scheme were continued on existing lines, but with interest reduced to 3 per cent, this result shows that it would no longer be possible to maintain the increase in pensions at the existing level of 50 per cent. The tempoiary increase of 25 per cent, for which provision has been made up to 31st December 3936, would have to be withdrawn after that date, and treating the scheme as a whole no further addition could be made to the permanent increase of 25 per cent, which was added after the last valuation. This result would hold only if the revised scheme were applied to the whole membership and it were con sidered expedient that the increase should continue to be at the same rate for all members irrespective of their ages. Since, however, the transfer is to bo optional different considerations arise, and, as explained in the letter accom- panving this Report, the effect of the change of interest from 4 to 3 per cent, varies with the ages and status of the persons concerned. It is therefore neces sary for the purpose of maintaining equity to apportion the funds in India among the various groups of subscribers and beneficiaries in accordance with theu respective interests under the existing scheme and then to ascertain vhat benefits the share of each group (together with future contributions) will bo able to support when it has been transferred to be trustees and invested at •&gt; pei cent. The results of calculations made on these lines are shown in the follow ing table, in which it has been assumed that the transfer would take place and the revisions in beenfits effected as from 1st April 193G. [It should be understood that the benefits as advised in paragraph 7 above would be applicable tn thope subscribers and beneficiaries who elected to continue under existing conditions.] LloFinD % f • &amp;15 on 31st Marco 1934 sliow, in continuation of the previous experience, that the majority of the claims made on the Branch consisted of payments of surrender values although the proportion of claims by death was substantially greater than before. During the five years under review three new contracts assuring Rs. 8,000 were effected, 22 contracts (including two of the new contracts) assuring Rs. 65,970 at death were surrendered for Rs. 37,168 after deduction of unpaid, instalmeuts of premiums, and 14 contracts assuring Rs. 39,720 became claims by death. The sums assured include the bonus additions added up to the date of surrender or death. On 31st March 1934 there were 84 contracts in force in respect of 71 subscribers. The original sums assured by these contracts amounted to Rs. 1,74,500 and the total bonus additions added up to 31st March 1929 amounted to Rs. 77,130, making the total sums assured on the valuation date Rs. 2,51,(330. The effective balance at credit of the Branch after allow ing for outstanding items was Rs. 2,53,710. The valuation, as on previous occasions, has been made on the basis of the O table of mortality, with interest at 3| per cent. 12. it will be seen from the Valuation Balance Sheet that there is a surplus of Rs. 85,147. Of this amount, Rs. 55,000 represents the balance carried forward after the last valuation, with its interest earnings, less the interim bonuses paid on contracts surrendered, and on claims during the quinquennium and Rs. 19,000 is due to profits from interest credited in excess of the valuation rate. 13. It is evident that substantial additions by way of further bonuses are possible. It the Branch were tio continue on existing lines I should recommend that a portion of the present surplus be kept in reserve to provide for the main tenance of further bonuses in future, regard being had, in particular, to the fact that interest pronts will be greatly diminished. But if, as I recommend In the letter accompanying this Report, the Branch is closed down and its commit ments taken over by the main Scheme, the surplus should be wholly distributed at the time of this operation since no further separate accounts would be kept thereafter. The surplus now declared, together with interest profits accrued since the valuation date, would enable further bonuses to be granted at the rate of 15 per cent, per annum in respect of the five years ending on the valuation date. _ As above indicated, this would represent a final settlement of the bonus question. The bonuses, payment of which, in addition to the basic sums assured, would be taken over and assured by the main fund, would be as follows :— (a) Members who effected contracts before 31st March 1929 are entitled to bonuses at the rate of 2 per cent, of the original sum assured in respect of each completed year of membership up to 31st March .1924, and at the rate of 3 per cent, in respect of completed years between 1st April 1924 and 31st March 1929, These members would receive a further bonus of 15 per cent, per annum on the original sum assured in respect of the succeeding five years. (J)) Entrants since 31st March 1929 (there was only one surviving on the valuation date) would receive a bonus of 15 per cent, in respect of each completed year of membership up to 31st March 1934. Teafsfer to Trustees in Britain. 14. The interests in the Branch of those members who elect to transfer their balances to the trustees would not be greatly affected since the present valua tion basis isjfixed with regard to the predominant element of the heavy surrender Tallies provided and the new basis must be governed by the same consideration. It is estimated that on transfer the existing benefits and bonus could be main tained and the bonus in respect of the five years ending on 31st March 1934 (i .e., the ' final ' bonus) be fixed at 12^ per cent, per annum. 15. I would direct attention to paragraph 12 of my letter accompanying this Report, in which 'i raise the question of the possible substitution of additions to pensions to widows or daughters (at the option of the contributors) in lieu of the present benefits payable as a life assurance benefit to the representative of a deceased contributor or as a surrender value to himself.

W. 1, A.G. 4386133. H th M AY 1933. Indian Military Service Family Pensions. Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State in Council of India to address you on the sulgect of the measures to be taken in connection with the impending consti- tutional changes in India, to secure the payment of pensions and other benefits ^ under the Indian Military Service Family Pension Regulations. Under the existing Regulations all contributions are credited to the revenues of India and the benefits are debited as a charge on those revenues. An account is kept of the receipts and payments Avith interest added thereto at the rates from time to time fixed by the Secretary of State in Council ; and the balance so arrived at is used, in conjunction with actual estimates of the remaining assets and liabilities, for the purpose of determining the amount of the benefits admissible. For all practical purposes, therefore, the position is that the benefits are met from a fund which is deposited at interest with the Secretary of State in Council. The existing method of account, however, obscures the true facts without altering them in any material respect, and it is proposed, from some convenient date in the near future, to amend it so as to show the true position. From the date of the change all contributions, payments and interest on balances will be credited or debited to a head outside the revenue account, the balance of which will be shown as a debt of the Government of India. It is recognised that this balance is the property of the subscribers from whose compulsory contributions it has been accumulated. The Secretary of State in Council desires, therefore, to make every possible effort to meet their wishes with regard to its disposal. Frequent representations have been made to him in the past that it should be transferred to England and held there out side the Indian Government Account ; and he is prepared to consider recom mending to His Majesty's Government the inclusion in the forthcoming Bill of provisions to this effect, on the lines set out below, if the subscribers, after considering the financial effects of this measure, should still hold it to be desirable. The proposals which I am to submit for your consideration are as follows :— That Commissioners or Trustees should be appointed for the purpose of holding and investing on behalf of the subscribers, in approved securities which would presumably be confined to those authorised by the Trustee Act, sums handed over to them ; that these Commissioners should be paid annually for this purpose the contributions received during the year and the interest allowed by the Government of India on the balance remaining in its hands ; and that money for the payment of pensions as they fall due should be provided by the Gcvern- ^ment of India out of the balance in its hands, which would thus be gradually reduced. It is estimated that this process would absorb the balance in the Government of India's hands in 15 to 20 years, after which period the entire funds would be represented by sterling investments. It is clearly essential, before any judgment can be formed as to the relative advantages or disadvantages of this scheme, to obtain some idea of its effect on the prospects of pensioners ; and a Comparison between the rates of interest obtainable on British securities with those now allowed on the balances will at once make it evident that this effect must be adverse. The position of the scheme in the matter of interest has in the past been highly favourable. The rate allowed on the balances has corresponded closely with that 'obtainable on the long-dated sterling debt of the Government of India ; and during the whole of the period of high interest rates which commenced in and succeeded the War &gt;the balances received the benefit of high interest without the loss in capital value which would have been suffered had they been invested in actual securities. The rate allowed on the balances is now 4^ per cent., to which figure it was reduced on 1st January last from 5 per cent, previously in force. The rate current on British securities is at present only 3^- per cent, or less, and should the rate rise in future it would be necessary to face a decline in capital value unless iii\ estment were to be made in securities with an early date of redemplion on which the yield is even less than 3| per cent. It should, perhaps, be added that whereas interest added to the balances is not now subject to income tax, interest received in the form of dividends on actual investments would under the existing law be to some extent liable to tax. The diminution of income thus caused would be small, inasmuch as the liability extends only to the excess of interest over the pension payments during the same period ; but in order to avoid this additional drain on the funds, Parliament will be asked, it the scheme is accepted, to exempt the interest on the funds from income tax by a clause in the new Government of India Act. An exact estimate of the prospects of future beneficiaries would require not only a forecast of those contingencies, such as rates of mortality and marriage, which ordinarily enter into actuarial calculations, but an accurate prediction of the future course of interest. This requirement is obviously incapable of fulfil ment. The only practicable course is to assume the current rate for long-dated British securities, and the Government Actuary has been asked to draw up an estimate on this basis. A copy of his report (which deals also with other family pension funds) is attached. The last valuation of the scheme, made as at 31st March 1929, revealed a surplus of approximately £2,200,000. This valuation assumed that a rate of 4 per cent, would be earned on future balances. In view of the size of the surplus actually realised, and the anticipation that the actual rate earned would for some considerable time exceed the 4 per cent, taken into account in the calcula tions, it was decided to continue in perpetuity the reduction of 20 per cent, in all contribulions and donations, which had for many years been in force as a tempo rary measure ; and to increase all pensions to a level 50 cent, above the original scale. _ Of the increase in pensions one-half, or 25 per cent, of the original scale, is temporary, and therefore liable to withdrawal even in the case of incumbent ptnsioners ; this being the portion the continued payment of which depended on the excess of the actual rate of interest obtained over the rate assumed in the valuation. It will be seen from the Report that Sir Alfred Watson estimates that, had the valuation been made at the rate of 3k per cent, instead of 4, the surplus available would have been sufficient, after allowing for the cost of continuing the reduction of 20 per cent, in contributions, to provide a permansnt increase of 20 per cent, only in pensions, while no temporary increase could have been recommended. Actually the position, in the event of the proposals outlined above being adopted, would be better than that indicated in the preceding paragraph. A valuation at 3-J per cent, assumes that that rate only will be earned on the balances from the valuation date. Four years have, however, passed since that, date, and a further period must in any case elapse before the scheme can come into force, during which the balances will have obtamed the benefit of interest at 5 and per cent. Moreover, the transfer of the balances into British securities will be gradual, and unless a fall occurs in the yield of Indian sterling- securities, which governs the rate allowed on the balances in the hands of the government of India, the average yield on the whole balance may, for some years, appreciably exceed 3^ per cent. While the ultimate results of the proposals now put forward must remain in doubt, it would, of course, be necessary, in the event of their adoption, to make some immediate changes in the Regulations. A valuation will become due on the Slst March next, and it is possible that its results will be known before definite action is necessarv. Should this, however, not be the case, so that action had to be taken in the light of the information at present available, it would perhaps be justifiable to assume for the time being that the effect of the mitigat ing circumstances mentioned in the previous paragraph would be such as to justify the retention of the permanent increase of 25 per cent, now in force. For21 future pensioners it would be necessary to withdraw the further 25 per cent, temporary increase. Incumbent pensioners might perhaps be allowed to retain this temporary increase for the present, in the hope that future valuation profits would allow of its continuance ; but it would be necessary to warn them that its discontinuance or reduction after the next valuation was possible if not indeed probable. I am to request that you will, after consideration of the probable effects on the finances of the fund as indicated above, state whether, in the event of (lie Secretary of State being willing to recommend to His Majesty's Government the inclusion in the coming Bill of provisions for the gradual investment of the balances in this country, you would be in favour of such a scheme. It would bo convenient if your reply could reach this Office by the end of June. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, L15FinD SIDNEY TUEXER, Controller of Pengicii Fuiids.23 Extract from the Report of the Joint Committee on Indian Constitutional Reform. Family Pension Funds. o2(). One category of pension payment stands in so special a position as to demand separate consideration. We refer to the pensions payable to families of officers, ci.vil and military, the cost of which is met not from the revenues of India but irom credits accumulatins' in the balances of the Government of India from subscriptions paid by the officers themselves. The Government of India are trustees of Ihese credits and the fullest possible consideration should be given to the Mews of the subscribers and beneficiaries as to the future administration of the trust. A iNote by the Secretary of State for India which is printed in the Committee's Records contains full particulars of these credits and the steps aliead^ taken to asceitain tne views ot subscribers. The Note also contains in outline proposals for the consideration ot subscribers and 'nensioners. The matters to bo decided aie technical and comrtlicated : and we hope therefore in consnlling subsclibers that every effort will be made to put the issues before them in the clearest possible way. We are glad to observe from paragraph 8 0 ^ ^ -&gt;ote that the Secretary of State hopes that, unless the prGsent financial situation unexpectedly deteriorates, it will be possible to convert existing rupee credits in India into sterling funds held in this country within quite a short period a tor the Constitution Act is passed and the wishes of subscribers and pensioners are know. We recommend that this should be done and that action should be taken generally on the lines indicated in the Note. Extract from Record containing' Papers laid before the Joint Committee. (Record CI, No. L). Memobandum by the Secretary of State fob India [25™ July, 1934] on the Action contemplated in belation to Family Pension Funds. [This Memorandum incorporates and brings up to date the memorandum previously published as Record VII (Session 1932-33).] ^ ai ' a £ ra Ph 73 of the introduction to the White Paper it was stated ttiat His Majesty's Government considered that the balances of the Family I ension Inmds must be recognised as a definite debt liability of the Government ot India and as the property of subscribers ; and that they were examining a proposal tor the gradual conversion of these assets into separate sterling funds. 2. Ihe Funds referred to do not include various funds, civil and military, w nch were established in the time of the East India Company under private management, the assets of those Funds were taken over bv Government, under powers conveyed by Acts of Parliament, and the pensions at fixed rates guaranteed as charges on the revenues of India. The capital of these Funds therefore no longei exists and the position of persons drawing pension under their rules differs m no way from that of officers in receipt of ordinary retiring pensions. 3. The Funds now under consideration are four in number (1) The Indian Military Service Family Pension Scheme. (2) The Indian Military Widows' and Orphans' Fund. (3) The Indian Civil Service Family Pension Scheme. (4) The Superior Services (India) Family Pension Fund. The first two are maintained by officers of the Indian Armv.

Tt was pointed out to the subscribers that bv investment in Trustee Stocks 1 o aS l e } i! ie 0( ? inmipslonors wou]cl be able to secure a yield equal to the rate of interest allowed on the balances under the existing arrangements, whicn js based on the current yield of India long-dated sterling securities • that allowance might have to be made, particularly in the present conditions for capital depreciation of investmenfs, a risk from which the Funds are now exempt: and that as a result it was probable that the proposals would involve some reduc tion m the rates of pension now payable. w.7' of tho abo Y e proposals would dearly be that the balance in the hands of the Government of India would cradnallv disappear as it was drawn npon to meet the demands of a growing pension list ; while a new fund would gradually be built up from the investments made by the Commissioners. The penod which would elapse before the transfer was complete, that is to say before the entire balances in the hands of Government had been paid out would vary with the different Funds. It has been estimated at from 15 to i20 years in the case of the Indian Military Service Familv Pension Scheme and at aq mnph as 40 years in the case of the Indian Military Widows' and Orphans' Fund, with lit tea mediate periods m the other cases. _ 8. A large^ majority of the re])lies received from subscribers indicated a desire tor the investment of the balances in sterling securities, but the scheme outlined m the circulars was criticised on the ground that the period elapsing belore transfer would be complete was too long. In order to meet this criticism it is proposed to abandon the scheme whereby the rate of transfer would be regulated automatically by the amount of the annual pavments of pension • and to STd )stiti;te a scheme wherebv transfer corld be made at anv rate allowed by the financial conditions of the time, but subiect in any case to the completion of the transfer by a fixed maximum period. It is hoped that, in practice, any maxi mum period will be inoperative. Should existing financial conditions continue viihout senous deterioration, it should be possible to complete the transfer within quite a short period after the Constitution Act has been passed and the subscribers and pensioners have expressed their final assent. It will, however.probably be desired that a limit shall be set by statute to the period of transfer j and in fixing this limit it is necessary to consider the possible effects on the exchange position of the Government of India. A scheme of this nature imposes no ultimate charge on Indian Revenues, which are in any case liable to pay the entire balances sooner or later in the form of pensions. It involves, however, the disbursement in sterling within the limits fixed of sums which would other wise remain a liability to be met at a later date ; and such an addition to the sterling requirements, if sufficiently large, might in certain circumstances become embarrassing. It would be imprudent to impose on the finances of the Federa tion what might prove to be an intolerable burden ; and it is thought, therefore, that the statutory maximum period should not be shorter than 12 years. This period is intended only as a limit by which the Government would be bound. As just indicated, it is expected that it will actually prove possible to complete the transfer within quite a short time, 9. It is not contemplated that the Commissioners should have any respons ibility for the administration of the pension schemes, or for the collection of subscriptions and disbursement of pensions. The administration would remain in the hands of the Secretary of State, who would decide, after consultation with subscribers, all such matters as rates of contribution or pension, changes in the regulations, &amp;c. The disbursement of pensions and collection of subscriptions would continue to be carried out through the ordinary paying agencies of the Government of India. The function of the Commissioners, therefore, would be solely that of holding and investing money handed over to them, and of supply ing from the funds in their hands, when required, money for the payment of pensions. 10. Inasmuch as the proposals, if accepted, would involve a change in .the conditions under which members of the Funds have hitherto subscribed, and moreover a change which, in some respects, for instance, in regard to the rate of interest realised, would be to their disadvantage, it is held that even though a large majority may desire the change it would be inequitable to impose on a minority who are content, as at present, to rely on the credit of the Government of India, the consequences of transfer. It is contemplated, therefore, that before any action is taken on the lines indicated above, circulars should be issued to all subscribers and pensioners setting out, as fully as possible, in the light of actuarial investigations now in progress, the prospects under the present condi tions and those, necessarily less favourable, which may be expected if the funds are invested in sterling ; and that each subscriber and pensioner should be asked to elect one or other of the two alternatives. 11. It should perhaps be mentioned that it will not be possible to put before the subscribers the precise effects of the election they will be called upon to make. The actuarial reports will show the results on the two suppositions lhat on the one hand the present arrangements are maintained in toto and on the other that the entire funds are invested in sterling. The effect of a reduction in the rate of interest is not, however, the same on all types of policy. It clearly varies with the probable duration of the liability, and must be greater in the case of a young subscriber, in respect of whom it is necessary to take account of possible pensions payable 70 years hence or even later, than in the case of an elderly subscriber or beneficiary. The results obtained for the whole of the funds will, therefore, only be true of portions of those funds if the portions are true samples of the whole, containing the proper proportion of each class, old and young, subscribers and beneficiaries. If, on the other hand, the result of the elections is to split the funds to a great extent by classes ; if, for instance, the majority of older subscribers and beneficiaries elect to remain under the existing conditions while the younger choose transfer to sterling investments ; then the effects on the two portions of any fund would differ both inter se and from the effects ascertained for the fund as a whole. While, therefore, every effort will be made to arrange the material in such a manner as to give the fullest information, it will be necessary to state that the figures must be regarded as to some extent provisional, and that the final effects can only be known after the election is actually made. 12. The division of the various funds each into two portions, which, apart from the highly improbable contingency of a unanimous vote, must be the effect of the election, may produce certain undesirable results. The financial stability of any pension scheme depends on the realisation of the estimates made of the prospects of death, marriage, fertility, &amp;c. ; and the smaller the membership the greater is the probability of casual variations from these estimates. There is, therefore, a danger that, if one or the other portion of any divided fund were a26 I small proportion of the whole, it might produce irregular results and be found, at a later date, either to be unreasonably large in comparison with its liabilities or, more regrettably, to be inadequate to discharge them. In the case of those who elect for transfer to invested funds no special steps in relation to this pos sible danger seem necessary ; firstly, because it is improbable, in view of the opinions already elicited from subscribers as recorded above, that the funds constituted by these subscribers will be unduty small, and secondly, because, as the position will have arisen by their own action and largely on their own initiative, it is reasonable that they should bear the consequences. ^ In the case, however, of those who elect to abide by the present conditions it is felt that they should be protected from any ill effects consequent on the withdrawal of the majority. It is contemplated, therefore, that if the numbers remaining are in any case too small to offer a reasonable prospect of stability, the fund should be taken over by the G-overmnent of India on lines similar to those followed in the case of the Presidency Funds in the last century ; that is to say, that the Government of India should assume full possession of the balance on deposit in its hands and should receive, as sums due to Indian revenues and not as deposits, all future contributions ; and should guarantee the payment from the revenues of India of pensions at such rate as might be shown, by actuarial valuations specially made for the purpose at the date of taking over, to be justified. 13. The above proposal would involve the possible extinction, in the case of the subscribers or pensioners electing to remain dependent on the Government Of India, of their existing right to benefit derived from their accumulated funds, and the substitution of a different right, namely, to fixed benefits payable from the revenues of India. In the case also of those subscribers who elect to rely for their dependants' pensions on funds invested in sterling securities there would be, as has been said above, a material change in the conditions under which they have hitherto subscribed ; and though in this case the change will have received the assent of all the individuals concerned, it is desiiable, if not essential, that any doubts as to the legitimacy of the action should be set at rest by legal sanction covering both cases. 14 Inasmuch as it is desirable that the measures taken in the case of each fund should accord as closely as possible with the views expressed by subscribers, which may not in all cases be identical, it seems inadvisable to include in the Constitution Act itself definite and final provisions. A form of permissive enactment would appear to be preferable, and it is therefore proposed : That His Majesty should be empowered by the Constitution Act to direct by Order in Council the appointment of Commissioners for the pur pose of receiving moneys accruing to or belonging to all or any of the Family Pension Funds, and of holding or investing the same for the purposes of the Funds ; and to make regulations for the transfer to the Commissioners, in such manner and within such a period as may be prescribed, of the moneys accruing to the Funds and the balances in the hands of the Government of India : provided that the period prescribed shall not exceed 12 years from the 31st March following the passing into law of the Constitution Act : and provided further that the regulations shall not require the transfer to the Commis sioners of moneys or balances relating to liabilities in ^ respect ot subscribers or pensioners who have signified their objection thereto . That the interest and dividends received by the Commissioners so appointed on sums invested in their hands shall be declared exempt from Income-Tax : That the Order in Council may prescribe an authority to determine the rate of interest to be added on the balances remaining in the hands of the Government of India : That the Order in Council may further provide that, in the case of any subscribers and beneficiaries who shall have signified their objection^ to the transfer to the Commissioners of the moneys or balances relat- • ing to their liabilities, it shall be open to the Secretary of State to grant to the said beneficiaries, or to the dependants of the sard^ sub- r scribers, a right to benefits payable from the revenues of India at fixed rates to be determined by him, and that the moneys and balances aforesaid shall in consideration of such grant lapse to the revenues of India and the Government of India shall be discharged of all liability in respect thereof.

Subscribers who have registered objection will become subject to new Rules to be made in due course under Section 273 of the Government of India Act, 1935. As the nature of these rules depends to a large extent on the numbers electing for or against transfer, their formulation will not be possible until some later date ; and the subscribers and pensioners affected will in the meantime continue to be subject to the provisions of the exist ing rules, so far as these may be applicable. Provisional rules to regularise the position of these subscribers in the period immediately succeeding 31st March 1937 are under consideration. A. L.
