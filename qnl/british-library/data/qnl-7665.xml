I have received the reply of the Persian Government to our joint note of the 22nd instant.* Our charge against the camarilla of giving the Shah evil counsels is repudiated as unauthenticated, and the note adds that the Shah stands in no need of advice from his entourage. The Persian Government requests us to inform our Governments that the Shah intends to grant an Assembly which shall be suited to the habits of the people and the nature of the country and shall be in accordance with the laws of Islam. They further lay stress on the disorders which took place in the country under the late constitutional regime, when the form of Assembly was not suited to the people. It is evident that the Council whose establishment His Majesty announced to the two dragomans on the 28th November is the Assembly contemplated.! No. 2. Sir Edward, Grey to Sir A. Nicolson. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, November 30, 1908. YOUR Excellency should inquire of M. Isvolsky whether he shares the views of His Majesty’s Government in the following matter :— We consider that the note which Sir G. Barclay and his Russian colleague have received from the Persian Government (see Sir G. Barclay’s telegram of the 30th instant) should not be left unanswered. Supposing that the Medjliss which the Shah has promised proved to be identical with the Council, respecting the appointment of which the Legation dragomans were informed two days ago, it is improbable that quiet will be restored or the nation contented with the non-elective basis of the Assembly. His Majesty’s Government consider that it would be well to give an intimation to this effect, and that the Shah should give orders to the said Council that a new electoral law be drafted without further delay. No. 3. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 1.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, December 1, 1908. PLEASE refer to your telegram dated yesterday. According to information received from the Russian Charge d’Affaires by M. Isvolsky, the proceedings of the projected Council have already begun, and the preparation of an electoral law is to be their first occupation. M. Sabline and Sir G. Barclay have, according to the former, agreed to do all in their power to expedite this, while observing an expectant attitude. [504] * See “ Persia, No. 1 (1909),” p. 208, No. 313. f See “ Persia, No. 1 (1909),” p. 216, No. 327. B2 In M. Isvolsky’s view, these circumstances might possibly render it unnecessary for the two Governments to make further representations to the Shah at present, but I explained to his Excellency that an elective basis was absolutely essential to the new Assembly, even if the franchise were somewhat more limited than that on ^ n ch the last Medjliss was elected ; no Council or other body consisting solely of the Shah s nominees could be accepted. As, however, the two Representatives in pieman lecom- mended a waiting attitude until it could be seen how the present Council worked, I said I would communicate with you again. In any case the electoral law should be prepared by the Council with all possible despatch. No. 4. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received December 1.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 1, 1908. ^ ST PETERSBURGH telegram of to-day. . The members of the new Council of Notables are ignorant and reactionary with the exception of one or two who are unwilling to attend ; in I act the composition of the body is unsatisfactory and clearly shows that the Shah is as far as ever from lealizing the necessity of a reformed regime. Unless we can induce the Shah to add to the Council some men of more enlightened and liberal views, I fear it would be useless to attempt to utilize it as a step toivards the re-establishment of an electi\e Assembly.

His Majesty has commanded that the placard shall be torn down and destroyed. The Shah thinks that the posting of the document was done by the clergy, but as some subordinate officials may also have been responsible His Majesty has ordered the Governor of Tehran to reprimand any persons found to be implicated.

Isvolsky that, in spite of the Russian Govern ment s statement that the Emperor did not desire to receive any condolences on the death of the Grand Duke Alexis, the Special Envoy’s visit would take place. The reply of the Persian Government had been to the effect that they still desired to send him, and that he would be the bearer of an important letter to the Emperor from, the Shah. No. 9. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 8.) _ Tehran, November 15, 1908. THE anti-Constitution demonstration on the 7th instant at Bagh-i-Shah and the telegrams which, it was given out, had been received from the provinces petitioning against the convocation of a Parliament were so obviously the result of the manoeuvres of the three or four Ministers, such as the Grand Vizier and the Minister of War, who have everything to lose by the re-establishment of constitutional government, that my Russian colleague and I thought it desirable to seek an opportunity of making it quite clear to the Shah that we did not regard these spurious expressions of public opinion as in any way absolving His Majesty from his pledges. Me accordingly asked for audiences, and the Russian Minister was received by the Shah on M^ednesday and I on the following day. I told His Majesty that I had asked for a private audience in order to have an opportunity of speaking to His Majesty about the present crisis, and I assured him that, in saying what I was about to say, I was prompted by the most earnest desire to serve His Majesty’s best interests and those of his country. I then proceeded to make the following statement:— “As your Majesty is aware, the cardinal principle of Great Britain and Russia in Persia is the avoidance of interference in her internal affairs. Erom this principle the two Governments will not depart. Nevertheless, the two countries, in their capacity as neighbours and friendly Powers sincerely desiring the prosperity and peaceful development of Persia, with which country they are in the closest relations, have always deemed it their duty to assist the Shah’s Government with good advice, and my Russian colleague and I are fully persuaded that the friendly counsels which, in pursuance of instructions from our Governments, we venture to tender to your Majesty will be particularly welcome at a moment when Persia is traversing a serious crisis. “ Information reaches us which shows that the Persian population of the capital and in the provinces is in a state of effervescence and anxiety. Your Majesty has promised to your people the re-establishment of the constitutional regime, and this promise has been solemnly expressed vis-a-vis to the two friendly Powers. The events of last Saturday are inconsistent with this promise. On that day, we are told, some hundreds of persons were assembled by orders of the Ministers at Bagh-i-Shah to pronounce against the Constitution, and a Petition was prepared in this sense under the influence, it is said, of the clergy and presented to your Majesty. My Russian colleague and I most earnestly hope that this demonstration, organized by men who are the enemies of the country, which in no way reflects the true sentiment of the people, will not serve to deflect your Majesty from your purpose or cause your Majesty to violate your pledges. The country, weary of disorders, abuses, and uncertainty, impatiently awaits the fulfilment of these pledges, and the two Govern ments which we represent cannot sufficiently insist on the necessity of pacifying the people in order to avert the great dangers which we foresee and which may have fatal results for the future. In like manner with my Russian colleague, I have the honour to draw your Majesty’s most serious attention to the disorders pending, which can now only be arrested by the fulfilment of the pledges which your Majesty has given to your people. [504] B 24 “In conclusion, I desire to draw your Majesty’s attention to the pitiable condition of certain of your subjects under arrest charged with political offences, who have remained for months in gaol without trial. We venture to appeal to your Majesty's clemency on behalf of these unfortunate men. After expressing his thanks for this advice, His Majesty answered the statement at considerable length. Having listened to the same language from M. de Hartwig the day before, he had had ample opportunity to prepare his reply, and he had doubtless been carefully primed by his reactionary advisers. He denied altogether the spurious character of the expressions of public feeling^ against a constitutional regime, and declared that there was a very large and influential portion of the people who regarded constitutional government as contrary to Islam. Hie Ministry had had no hand in the organization of the demonstration at Bagh-i-Shah, though no doubt the clergy had made their influence felt. He himself was m favour of a Parliament. Persia needed one, hut it must he of a very different character from the late Medjliss His Majesty drew a distinction between the present situation and that which existed at the end of 1906. Then the Government was against the Constitution and the people desired it. Now, on the contrary, the Government desired it and the people were against it. He had no intention of violating his pledges and had not yielded to the demonstration at Bagh-i-Shah; far from that, he vas engaged in seeking to devise a Constitution which would suit the country. An electoral law had already been submitted to the provinces, but he must have time to ascertain how far it was' acceptable to his people. The haste with which his last rescript had been published which was due to the pressure of the two Legations, was responsible for much of the present discontent. He must now he allowed time in order to wm over those opposed to Parliamentary government. Beferring to the persons under arrest, His Majesty said that he believed that those still in gaol ueie ciiminals and not political’ offenders, hut he promised to examine the list. I replied that I was very glad to learn that His Majesty was resolved to re-establish a constitutional regime. I had no desire to prescribe to His Majesty what form of constitutional government was needed for Persia, but what was necessary in the interests of tranquillity was that the people should be as promptly as possible disabused of the impression generally prevailing that His Majesty had no intention of carrying out his promises to his people. I ventured to differ from him as to public feeling in regard to Parliamentary government, and added that it was certainly the general belief that the demonstration against a Parliament was insincere. I then urged the good effect which would he produced on the situation at Tabreez by the fulfilment of His Majesty’s pledges. This and the granting of an amnesty offered the best chance of restoring tranquillity there. _ t ■ n e x. In the conversation that followed there was little, I think, deserving of further record, for it was principally a reiteration of what had already been said, but I should mention that the Shah, in referring to Tabreez, said that those who were in arms against him were not fighting for the Constitution. They were most of them Caucasian revolutionaries, and the fighting which had been going on for a year was merely an ordinary tribal rebellion. I ventured to point out to His Majesty that the fiediting did not begin until the end of June, immediately after the destruction of the late Medjliss. I reminded His Majesty that the Tabreezis had recently telegraphed expressions of loyalty, and this seemed to me to offer a good opportunity for conciliation, and I repeated my opinion that an amnesty and a prompt fulfilment of His Majesty’s pledges was the best means of securing the restoration of order. After I had taken leave of the Shah, His Majesty asked Mr. Churchill, who was with me, to stay behind for a moment. He asked him to explain to me, what he had not liked to say in the presence of the Persian interpreter, that the troops who were with him at Bagh-i-Shah had come to the capital in the belief that they were needed to defend their religion, and that they would he dangerously incensed if His Majesty were to grant Parliamentary government, which they believed to he contrary to Islam. The idea which the Shah washed me to carry awny with me, viz., that his position was that of a Sovereign desirous to rule as a constitutional Monarch, and that he w r as only deterred from doing so by the reluctance of the bulk of his people to accept him in that capacity, is of course grotesque. The greater part of the population outside of the capital and a few of the larger towns are probably indifferent, but the large majority of the more or less educated classes are certainly in favour of a constitutional Govern ment. The merchants particularly and those with an honest stake in the couutry seein it their only chance of security from the extortions to which they are now exposed at the hands of the Shah’s irresponsible advisers. I cannot say that I am hopeful as to the results of the two audiences. M. de Hartwig, who left Tehran to-day, and who had another audience yesterday, tells me that he took the opportunity to talk once more very earnestly to the Shah, and that His Majesty promised that within two or three days he would publish a rescript. Even if this promise is fulfilled I doubt very much whether the measures will be of a satisfactory nature, for Avhoever has been engaged in preparing it, no one of the few Persians now in the country independent enough and competent to collaborate in the framing of a useful scheme has, I feel sure, had any hand in it. I have, &amp;e. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. No. 10.. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received December 9.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 9, 1908. IT is understood at the Russian Legation that the Shah is now showing an attitude less opposed to a Constitution. As the moment seems opportune for such a step, we are requesting an audience of His Majesty for the two dragomans who will hand petitions in favour of the Constitution from the people of Meshed and Astra bad to the Shah. They will also inquire as to the result of the deliberations which, according to His Majesty’s statement to them at their audience of the 28th ultimo, were then in progress. No. 11. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edivard Grey .—[Received December 10.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 10, 1908. THE Shah and Constitution. The Official Gazette of yesterday states that His Majesty has decided to establish a great Council composed of fifty members. These will include priests and merchants and men skilled in State affairs, and others who will be elected by the people. All branches of affairs of State will be supervised by the Council, who will discuss reforms to be introduced into the finances and other Departments of the State. No. 12. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—[Deceived December 12.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 12, 1908. MY telegram of the 10th instant. A copy of the regulations for the new Council has been given to me by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. There is no mention of the election of any members in addition to those chosen by the Shah. There are nevertheless some good points in the regulations, and, given a well-intentioned Shah and a nucleus of members enlightened, courageous, and honest enough to make good use of the powers conferred upon them, the new measure would probably offer the best chance of good government that Persia could have. As it is, the Council, which is the result of the efforts of the two Legations during three months, will probably be useless, and it is hardly to be expected that the situation in the northern provinces will be favourably affected. * 501 No. 13. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received December 12.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 12, 1908. MY telegram of the 9th instant. We have been informed, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that, owing to an [501] B 3indisposition, His Majesty will not be able to receive the two dragomans. Ala-es- Snltaneh requests tliat tlie communication which we wished to make to the Shah may be made through his Highness. We have declined this proposal, and have asked that the dragomans may be received by the Shah when His Majesty is well again. No. 14. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 14.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 14, 1908. MY telegram of the 12th instant. The composition of the Council makes it clear that the regulations are merely intended to hoodwink us. We are, in view of the Shah’s refusal to receive our dragomans, x^resenting through the Minister for Foreign Affairs a joint memorandum reminding His Majesty of his promises, and pointing out that the formation of a Council composed of members appointed by himself cannot be viewed as an accomplishment of his undertakings. We repeat our conviction that the only hope of terminating the present deplorable situation lies in the convocation of an elective Assembly and an amnesty for Tabreez. No. 15. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 15.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, December 15, 1908. AT an interview which I had with M. Isvolsky to-day I spoke to his Excellency about the Shah’s evasion of his promises and indifference to our advice. I said that it should be impressed seriously on the Shah that we could not allow this attitude of his to continue. M. Isvolsky asked what measures I had to propose. He was averse to any action which would look like direct intervention in favour of either party. I pointed out that the Shah had' undertaken to promulgate an electoral law and call together an Assembly, and that we had strongly urged that an amnesty should be granted to the people of Tabreez. It would be sufficient if we took our stand on these facts. We should continue persistently to press the Shah to fulfil these engagements. No. 16. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 17.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 17, 1908. A MEETING took place this morning between M. Sabline and myself and Saad- ed-Dowleh, who had sent word to the Russian Legation yesterday that he would like an interview with the two representatives, as he had a message to deliver to them from the Shah. The Shah’s message was to inquire whether the two Governments would be prepared to make an advance of 400,000/ if a Constitution were granted. Saad-ed- Dowleh explained that he had been pressed by His Majesty to accept office if he thought that he could save the country, but that he had. refused to do this except under a constitutional regime, making it clear to His Majesty that the only hope of improvement in the present state of affairs lay in the establishment of a Constitution. The Shah, it appeared, was now favourably disposed, and had commanded him to sound the two representatives as to the possibility of an advance. I replied, on behalf of the two representatives, that he should inform the Shah that there was no hope whatever that the two Governments would make the advance suggested except under a constitutional regime, and that this did not mean that it would be sufficient if the Shah merely issued a Decree promising a Constitution to his people. It would be essential that the Constitution should be put in force, and the two Governments would require guarantees that the money advanced was put to X roper uses. Though I could not tell him the exact nature of such guarantees, the two Governments would need the assurances of M. Bizot that they were adequate. As I gathered that His Majesty was afraid that such guarantees might involve theoccupation of territory or customs, I reassured Saad-ed-Dowleli on this point, but at the same time I made it quite clear that we should naturally require guarantees as regards interest on the sum advanced. I added that things were going from bad to worse in the country, and urged that His Majesty should lose no time in announcing to the people his good intentions if he were now in earnest. Though the two Govern ments could not prescribe any particular form of Constitution as suitable to the country, I assured Saad-ed-Dowleh that if he needed our support and advice in his efforts to devise one he coidd rely on the two Governments. Saad-ed-Dowleh appeared very hopeful when he left the Legation. No. 17. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received December 21.) Sir, Tehran^ November 25, 1908. AS reported in my telegram of the 22nd instant,* a further demonstration was held at Bagh-i-Shah on the 19th instant against the convocation of an Assembly. What exactly happened is not quite clear, but it appears to be certain that a petition from the clergy, prepared under the auspices of Sheikh Eazlullah, the Imam Jumeh, the Grand Vizier, Prince Naib-es-Sultaneh, the Shah’s uncle and father-in-law, and Amir Behadur Jang, was presented to the Shah, representing that an Assembly was contrary to Islam, and that His Majesty, with a show of reluctance, gave a rescript in the sense desired. The rescript was sent to the Government printer on the 21st instant, and on that day the Grand Vizier told Abbas Kuli Khan, in answer to an inquiry from me, that it was to be promulgated as soon as printed. After consulting with my Bussian colleague, we agreed to present to the Minister for Poreign Affairs a memorandum signed by us both, urging the Shah to reconsider his decision. As it was, it was too late to prevent the appearance of the Shah’s rescript, which was early in the evening in the hands of the public, and had been sent to the clergy in the provinces with orders to make it public. I afterwards ascertained that Ala-es-Sultaneh did not communicate our note to the Shah until the evening of the 23rd. It appears to have had an immediate effect, for on the same night orders were sent to the printer to distribute no more copies, and efforts were made to withdraw from circulation the copies already issued. The following evening Ala-es- Sultaneh sent me word by Mr. Churchill that he was to come and see me the next morning to explain the real character of the rescript. Ala-es-Sultaneh called this morning, and said that he had come by order of the Shah to give me certain supplementary information respecting the rescript. He said that it did not mean that the Shah would not summon any Medjliss, but only that he would not have a Medjliss like the last. Besides this, it was not a rescript, properly speaking, at all; it was merely an answer to the Ulema; it was not official, as it had not been published through the Grand Vizier, and it had been printed and circulated by the clergy. I replied that it was much to be regretted that it should have been published at all, and I asked him whether I might inform my Government that it was against the Shah’s orders that it had been made public. It seemed to me that his Highness sought to evade a direct answer, but finally he said I might telegraph that, so far as he knew, the document had not been printed by command of the Shah, who was still resolved to convoke a Medjliss suitable to the needs of the country and compatible with Mahommedan law, in accordance with the promise contained in his Decree of the 24th September. (See my despatch of the 8th ultimo, inclosing the Decree.I) I gathered that the contemplated Medjliss is nothing more than a Council of State to be nominated by the Shah, and I asked his Highness when the electoral law might be expected. He replied that His Majesty had caused one to be prepared, but had been prevented from promulgating it because of the manifest signs that his people were opposed to a constitutional regime. A long discussion then ensued as to the desirability of a Medjliss. Briefly, I may say that I repeated my opinion that in the convocation of an elective Assembly lay the only chance of restoring order in Azerbaijan and quiet in the rest of Persia. His Highness declared it to be his opinion that the trouble in Azerbaijan had nothing to do with the question of the Constitution, that Persia was not ready for Parliamentary Government - a fact which the excesses of the late Medjliss proved—and that the majority of the * See “ Persia, No. 1 (1909),” p. 208, No. 313. f See “ Persia, No. 1 (1909),” p. 199, No. 281. [504] B 48 people were against it. He added that the Shah feared that bloodshed would ensue if an Assembly were convoked, so strong was the feeling against it, and he showed me a bundle of telegrams from the provinces to prove this general anti-Constitution sentiment. In reply to his inquiry whether I doubted the authenticity of these telegrams, I said that I did not, hut that I was, nevertheless, convinced that they could not be taken as evidence of any genuine public feeling which, so far as the people in the Capital, the educated classes, and those who had a stake in the country were concerned, was, I was convinced, in favour of an elective Assembly, by which the Shah’s evil counsellors could be subjected to some control. The great bulk of the people, I admitted, probably cared nothing for a Constitution, but what they did desire was security and peace, and this was not to be obtained under the present deplorable regime. I asked Ala-es-Sultaneh to arrange for an audience for the two dragomans. His Highness discouraged the idea, suggesting instead a private audience for myself. I pointed out that my last audience had served no useful purpose, and expressed the opinion that a frank conversation between the Shah and the dragomans might lead to more useful results. If I had another audience it would be jointly with my Hussian colleague, and we should probably have to make further representations to His Majesty under orders from our Governments. It was in the hope of avoiding this necessity that we wished for an audience for the two dragomans. His Highness evinced some curiosity as to the further representations we should have to make, and affected to be anxious lest the dragomans might go too far in what they said. I endeavoured to reassure him, and in the end he consented to take the Shah’s pleasure regarding the proposed audience. I inclose a translation of the Shah’s rescript, and also a copy of the joint note of the 22nd November. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. (Translation.) Inclosure 1 in No. 17.

But by the help of the absent Imam (may his appearance be hastened!) the necessary instructions have been, and will be, given for the extension of justice.

G. BARCLAY. SABLINE. (Translation.) Highness, - Tehran, November 22, 1908. THE Representatives of Great Britain and Russia have learnt with surprise and regret that His Imperial Majesty, following the evil counsels of his surroundings, and making use as a pretext of petitions which in no way represent the true feelings of his people, does not intend to convoke an assembly ot‘ Representatives of the people. The representatives of the two Powers will not fail to inform their Governments by telegraph of the Shah’s regrettable decision, which discloses his intention of not fulfilling promises repeatedly given to his people and to the two Representatives ; and it will he their duty at a later date to make representations by order of their Govern ments, in order to convince His Majesty of the necessity, both in his own interests and in those of his country, of revoking his decision in this matter. Whilst awaiting the instructions of their Governments, the two Representatives, although desirous of avoiding any interference in the internal affairs of Persia, feel it their duty to repeat their conviction that the sole method of conciliating the people, who, owing to the Shah’s attitude towards the constitution, are in revolt in the province of Azerbaijan, and in a state of effervescence and excitement in the capital as well as in the other provinces, would he for His Majesty to free himself from the counsels of persons interested in a continuance of the present deplorable regime and re-establish constitutional government. G. BARCLAY. SABLINE. No. 18. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 21.) Sir, Tehran, November 29, 1908. IN continuation of my despatch of the 25th instant, I have the honour to transmit copy of the reply of the Persian Government to the joint note which my Russian colleague and I addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 22nd instant, in the hope of stopping the publication of the Shah’s rescript, in which His Majesty announced his abandonment of all idea of summoning the Medjliss. ' You will see that we are requested to notify in the proper 'quarter the Shah’s resolve to grant a Medjliss suited to the nature of the country, to the laws of Islam, and to the habits of the Persian people. The Medjliss in question is doubtless the Council appointed by the Shah, the institution of which was announced by His Majesty to the two Dragomans at their audience on the 28th instant, recorded in a separate despatch.* It will he noticed that the first paragraph of the note is much involved. Its object, however, is plain enough, viz., to convict my Russian colleague and me of having made unauthenticated rumour the basis of our representation. The Persian Government do not go so far as to assert that our information that the Shah had decided not to convoke a representative assembly was incorrect. The Grand Vizier had himself given me to understand as much, and the Shah’s decision stands recorded in a document signed by His Majesty and printed by the Government printer, which for some time circulated freely ; but they declare that we had no ground for attributingthis resolve to the evil councils of His Majesty’s courtiers,^ of whose advice His Majesty stands in no need, and who “ do not hold such a view,” a phrase which, if it has any sense at all, can only mean that the Shah’s courtiers are not opposed to a representative assembly—a truly astounding contention. Our note served its purpose in so far as its presentation to the Shah was promptly followed by the issue of orders to suppress the rescript, and my Russian colleague and I think we can afford to overlook the imputation that we acted on an unfounded rumour. 1 have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. Inclosure in No. 18. Ala-es-Sultaneh to Sir G. Barclay. (Translation.) Your Excellency, Tehran, November 27, 1908. 1 HAVE had the honour to receive your Excellency’s note of the 22nd November. The accusation of giving evil counsels, which was made against the courtiers only on the strength of a report to this effect, which has no foundation whatever, and caused surprise and regret to the two exalted representatives, has caused greater surprise and regret to me, because you have based this regrettable statement on a report, and have allowed your thoughts such a degree of freedom before verifying the authenticity of such a report, and that you have stained the courtiers of the Imperial Government merely on the belief that they hold such a view, when they do not entertain it at all. Thank God, His Imperial Majesty, with the great talent and vigilance which he shows for the task of keeping in order the monarchical system and for the comfort of his people, does not stand in need of any advice from his courtiers. His Majesty is by nature well versed in the duties he is called upon to perform for his country and people. His Majesty is also well acquainted with the customs and habits of the Persian people, and will act in accordance with the exigencies of the time, and will now grant a Medjliss which will suit the requirements of the time, the religion, and national customs of the Persian people, but will not cause anarchy and trouble in the country. I do not consider it superfluous to draw your Excellency’s attention to the state of affairs during the two years of the Constitutional system of Government, which gave rise to all kinds of disorders, and I have to point out that the grant of a Medjliss such as the last one is not suited to the feelings of the public, and that so much liberty is unbecoming, and will produce the anarchy and mischief which have already been witnessed. In view of the friendship which happily exists between the two Governments, and which the high officials of the two Governments wish to maintain and to strengthen, I trust your Excellency will notify to the proper quarter the royal intention of granting a Medjliss suited to the nature of the country, the laws of Islam, and the habits of the Persian people, so that the country and the nation may prosper under the auspices of His Imperial Majesty.

General News. The British and Russian Legations made joint representations to the Persian Government, through their dragomans, on the subject of the attack by Royalist troops near Tabreez on an Armenian village, when a number of Armenians were killed and wounded. Recent developments at Meshed, due no doubt to the presence there of the Tehran Mujtehid, Seyed Mohammed, and the impossibility of gaining an entry into Tabreez, so far experienced by the Ain-ed-Dowleh, supported by the Shah’s troops, added to the growing financial distress. (Signed) G. P. CHURCHILL. Oriental Secretary. December 2, 1908. Tabreez. His Majesty’s Consul-General arrived from Urumia on the 9th November. On the 11th November he reported that a reinforcement of 400 cavalry was said to have reached the Governor-General at Basminch. On the 13th some of the Royalist reinforcements under Semsam Khan, disobeying the Governor-General’s orders, attacked Mujambar and killed and wounded several Armenians; 300 Persian Cossacks, with six guns, also joined the Royalist camp on this day, but Mr. Wratislaw reported that Tabreez was not impressed by their arrival. On the 16th November Maraga was occupied by a force of Nationalists, but on the 30th November they were reported to have been driven out and to have returned to Tabreez. A local Assembly was re established at Dilman (Salmas) on the 13th, and on the 23rd Bonab, on the eastern shore of Lake Urumia, w r as occupied by Nationalists, after a fight with the Chahardowleh horsemen. On the 18th November the Nationalists telegraphed to the Parliaments of London, Paris, and St. Petersburgh protesting against the false reports of danger to foreign subjects. Resht. The Governor-General’s expedition to Talish ended in complete failure. His troops ravaged the country as they went, in some places destroying the property of Russian subjects. At Kerganrud, on the 15th November, they w^ere attacked by the inhabitants and fled, losing a gun. Mr. Rabino is of opinion that the expedition was not necessary, as the Kerganrudis had repeatedly declared their loyalty and their willingness to accept any Governor except Serdar Amjad, at whose hands they had been much oppressed in the past. On the 15th November the Customs buildings at Enzeli were set fire to, but the fire was put out before much damage was done. It is supposed to have been the work of Nationalists, who wished to destroy a large consignment of arms and ammunition intended for the Shah which was in the Customs buildings. Some 180 rifles were destroyed. Meshed. A letter, containing a strong attack on the Shah in the name of the Kerbela priests and calling on the people of Khorassan to rise, was circulated here in October and caused much excitement. Telegraphic reports from Meshed state that some 4,000 students assembled at the Shrine on the 29th November and had the bazaars closed. Next day a riot occurred, owing to the arrest of a prominent revolutionary, and the students and troops exchanged shots. On the 1st December the situation was serious, the numbers of the revolutionaries had increased, many tradesmen having joined the students, and troops were picketing the streets. Astrabad. The Russian Legation has received information from Astrabad that disturbances have broken out there and that the Governor had threatened to bombard the town.12 Ispahan. On the 8th November Ispahan was placed rinder martial law, apparently with the object of preventing the priests from exciting the people against the authorities. The town has remained quiet. About the 20th November the priests received a telegram from the reactionary priests in Tehran stating that the Shah had given up all idea of having a Constitution. The telegram was not made public in Ispahan. The roads, the Bakhtiari road excepted, continue to be infested with robbers. A robbery of thirty camels with their loads was reported on the 17th instant near Yezdikhast. Twenty Cossacks sent to Balk from Yezd were ambuscaded by robbers and deprived of all their belongings, except two rifles and such of their ponies as were branded. Yezd. The people of Taft recently attacked twenty-five horsemen sent to collect revenue, beat them, deprived them of their rifles and clothing, and detained several as hostages to prevent the Governor arresting any Taftis who may visit Yezd. The Taftis have now begun to levy contributions on passing caravans. Kermanshah. The Kalhur and the Guran tribes were in the middle of November occupying Ser-i-Pul, one march from Kasr-i-Shirin, with a view to attacking Semsam-ul-Mamalek, Chief of the Senjabi tribe, who is Governor of Kasr-i-Shirin. - - •: * Shiraz. Sixty-four men of the Buz-Chalu regiment entered the Consulate on the 14th October and refused to leave until the arrears of two years’ pay had been given them. His Majesty’s Acting Consul did not intervene, but all left by the 21st October, the Persian authorities having paid them in full. The Kamareh regiment, 600 strong, arrived about the 20th October. The district of Bar is reported to be terrorized by Seyed Abdid Hussein Lari, who has announced that to pay revenue to the present Shah is contrary to Islam. Robberies are still of frequent occurrence on both the Ispahan and Bushire roads. A post was recently robbed near Sivend and the driver of the postal waggon brutally murdered. Several robberies have also occurred in the immediate neighbour hood of the town. (Signed) C. B. STOKES, Major, Military Attache'. No. 20. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received December 21.) Tehran, December 4, 1908. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copy of a Memorandum drawn up by Mr. Churchill giving an account of his and M. Baranowsky’s audience of the Shah on the 28th ultimo. The Council, whose institution the Shah announced to the two dragomans and which His Majesty was urged to intrust with the framing of an electoral law, is composed for the most part of men of reactionary views, and unless the Shah can be induced to summon to it men of more liberal views, it will be vain to look to it for any assistance towards the revival of the Constitutional regime. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. P.S.—I have just seen a translation of the invitation issued by the Grand Vizier to the members of the Council called the High Medjliss of State, bidding them to attend its meetings. Their functions are stated to be general supervision over the Ministers and Provincial Governors, and “to acquaint themselves with the Shah’s commands and the duties laid down for them.”Inclosure in No. 20. Memorandum by Mr. Churchill. M. BARANOWSKY and 1 were received by the Shah this morning at 11‘30 in an upper room of the building in Bagh-i-Shah, formerly used for the custody of political prisoners. No one was present at the audience besides the Shah and ourselves. M. Baranowsky began by saying that we had come on behalf of the British Minister and the Russian Charge d’Affaires to ask His Majesty what steps he had taken to fulfil his promises. The Shah replied that his answer to this inquiry was a long one, and required papers which he had not at hand for the moment, and the explanations which he wanted to give were so lengthy that he would send his Minister for Foreign Affairs to the British and Russian Legations to make them. I then said to the Shah that the reason M. Baranowsky and I had been sent to His Majesty was that it was hoped that His Majesty would speak frankly to us and teil us his views without reserve. We ourselves proposed to speak with equal frankness, and we, in fact, thought we could show His Majesty that the views and interests of the British and Russian Governments were identical with His Majesty’s. The Shah replied that he was quite ready to speak frankly, but the difficulty was that no one listened to him. I said that every one agreed with His Majesty that the first Medjliss was a failure, and no one desired to bring back the disorders of the regime which he had put an end to, but that the present regime was quite as bad, if not worse, and could not be allowed to continue. The Shah reiterated that no one listened to him, and said that he intended to keep his promises. I then took from my pocket his recent rescript, and said that his latest pronouncement did not appear to bear this out, but the Shah, interrupting, took the paper from me and endeavoured to explain that the phrase “ we will not even mention such a Medjliss ” referred to the last Assembly, and observed that I apparently could not read Persian. M. Baranowsky then urged the Shah, in the most emphatic manner, to keep his promises as the only means of re-establishing order and calming Tabreez. He said that the danger of bast was always present and that no one desired a Medjliss such as the last, but that a large section of the people were resolved to have a parliamentary regime. The Shah, in reply, said that, on the other hand, most of the people were opposed to it, and if he issued orders for elections to-day there would certainly be bloodshed to-morrow. I then said to His Majesty that this was the surest proof of the self-interested policy pursued by His Majesty’s courtiers. If they told him that the people were opposed to a Medjliss they had told him that which was not true. The Shah made a show of resenting this imputation, and spoke up for his courtiers rather sharply. M. Baranowsky again urged the Shah to keep his promises, and when His Majesty spoke of the Council which was to meet the following day, M. Baranowsky pointed out that a body chosen by the Shah was not at all what had been promised, and that they must be elected by the people. The Shah repeated that the majority of the people were against a Medjliss ; M. Baranowsky merely replied, “ No, this is not the case,” to which the Shah made no answer. M. Baranowsky, continuing, said that the best course for His Majesty was to order this new Council to draw up an electoral law by which an Assembly would be convened composed of intelligent deputies who would co-operate with the Ministers in the much-needed work of reform. The Medjliss would not be composed of shopkeepers and ignorant men as before, and no one wanted “ Anjumens ” or a free press such as the last. The Shah said he would think over this proposal and talk over the matter with those who so strongly opposed the Medjliss. I said that if His Majesty would realize how dangerous a continuance of the present regime was, and how urgent it was, in his own interests, to inaugurate a new one, and in fact to take the lead in a new regime which should be directed towards the much-needed reforms, it would no longer be necessary for him to stay at Bagh-i-Shah. The Shah emphatically declared that he was by no means afraid to return to the Palace in town; he stayed at Bagh-i-Shah because he liked the place. M. Baranowsky again pressed to know definitely whether His Majesty had decided to intrust the new Council with the work of elaborating an electoral law, and the Shah repeated that after considering the matter and discussing it with those who opposed the re-establishment of an elected Medjliss, he would give a reply to the British Minister and Russian Charge d’Affaires through his Minister for Foreign Affairs.

THIS afternoon I received a visit from M. de Hartwig. He thinks that the Shah’s hesitation to act on the advice of the two Legations wonld cease if a hope were held out to him that, in the event of his taking immediate steps to promulgate an electoral law on reasonable lines and to convoke an Assembly, certain financial assistance might possibly be afforded to him by the two Governments. He feels convinced that continuance of the present situation will lead to anarchy, by which intervention might be rendered inevitable. M. Isvolsl^y, I believe, shares these views of M. de Hartwig.

The Grand Vizier received the two dragomans, who urged that the Shah should older the Council, to which a few good men should be added, to complete the Electoral Law which His Majesty, before the demonstration of the 7th November, reported in my telegram of the 8th November,had been about to publish. It is expected that the Shah will receive the dragomans in audience this afternoon. No. 24. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 23.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran^ December 22&gt;, 1QQS. SHAH told the two dragomans, for whom His Majesty sent yesterday, that he desired it to be understood by the two Representatives that he was resolved to fulfil ins promises, and that he was on the point of doing so when the people, by taking bast at the luikish Embassy, sought to force his hand. His Majesty was anxious not to have the appearance of giving way on this account. After the audience was ended the Shah saw the Grand Vizier and the Minister of War. Afterwards the foimer promised that a statement, drafted by the two dragomans and signed by himself, should to-day be communicated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the effect that His Imperial Majesty undertakes to issue on the day following the withdiawal of the refugees in the Turkish Embassy a rescript providing for the elaboration, by a Committee selected by His Majesty and comprised in the Council of State, of an electoral law. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is to retain this statement after it has been shown to-day to a delegate from the two Legations. * * See “ Persia, No. 1 (1909),” p. 204, No. 297.15 No. 25.

His Majesty’s Government are prepared, if the Shah again raises the question, to inquire into it and to consider whether it would be possible for them to associate themselves in a joint guarantee of the interest accruing from a sufficiently well secured loan; they would, however, only do this after assurances had been received by the two Legations from M. Bizot that, having thoroughly investigated the matter, he considers that it is necessary and desirable that a loan should he granted. His Majesty’s Govern ment can on no account go further than this, and until the Shah has issued an electoral law and fixed an early date for the elections they can express no opinion. In any case they could not entertain the question until satisfactory guarantees were provided for the use to which the money would he put and a Constitution working. M. Isvolsky should he acquainted with these views, and in informing him you should add that, if such a measure appears to M. Bizot feasible, it will in our opinion he better to abandon the project of a loan, even when the Constitution is in working order. No. 26. Sir G.

THE Grand Vizier, whom the two dragomans visited yesterday in order to remonstrate with him for having failed to furnish the written undertaking he had promised them, showed himself unexpectedly stubborn, and used all the old arguments about the laws of Islam being opposed to election by the people. At a moment when the Shah seemed on the point of yielding to our representations I cannot account for this change of attitude on the part of the Grand Vizier.

The effect on the Shah of our holding out the hope of an advance (see my telegram of the 17th instant) has been only momentary, and I do not think that we properly can go further on these lines. I cannot but feel some anxiety in regard to the situation. I understand that the people may close the bazaars at any moment, and this would give the Shah a pretext for using repressive measures. I consider that the moment has now come for representations of a more cogent character, as the result of our pressing advice has so far been practically nil. I would suggest that the two Representatives might demand an audience of the Shah and point out to His Majesty that,the only way of calming the present agitation is to dismiss the Grand Vizier and the Minister of War from his Councils, promptly to intrust to competent persons the framing of the electoral law which he has promised to his people and to the two Representatives, and to grant an amnesty to those of his subjects who are under arms in the Province of Azerbaijan, and that if these measures are not taken the two Governments will infer that His Majesty refuses definitely to follow their advice, and will leave him to settle matters with his people without further giving him advice and sympathy. .

In continuation of my telegram of the 1st instant, His Majesty’s Consul-General at Ispahan reports that there was fighting yesterday between the troops and the malcontents. It is not known how many casualties occurred. The soldiers, who are out of hand, their officers being powerless, have pillaged the greater part of the bazaars.^ Complete anarchy now reigns in the city. The Governor and other local authorities are in bast at His Majesty’s Consulate-General. Samsarn-es-Sultaneh, the Ilkhani, with a number of Bakhtiaris is expected to arrive to-day, and will join his forces to those of the malcontents. Telegraphing last night, Mr. Grahame did not think that British subjects run any immediate danger. The trouble, it appears, is principally due to grievances against the Governor, and on first hearing of the agitation I urged the Persian Government to give the malcontents such assurances as would bring about the restoration of order. M. Sabline and 1 had a telegraphic conversation with our Consuls this morning, and as a result a memorandum is being handed to the Shah through the Grand Vizier, urging the dismissal of the incompetent Governor, the withdrawal of the worst of the regiments, and the handing over of the functions of the Governorship to the Ilkhani. We are holding the Persian Government responsible for British and Russian losses.Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received January 4, 1909.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, December 25, 1908. MAHMOUD KHAU, Ala-ul-Mulk, the Persian Special Envoy, called on me yesterday afternoon. He informed me that he had seen M. Isvolsky, and that he had heen unable to wait upon the Emperor, as His Majesty was not receiving visits of condolence in respect to the death of the late Grand Duke Alexis. Mahmoud Khan then dwelt at some length on the back-slidings of the last Persian Assembly, and expatiated on its incompetency, the corrupt and selfish aims of its Members, its assumption of duties properly appertaining to its executive Government, and on other misdeeds which had caused it to be thoroughly discredited throughout the country. He said that the general attitude of the Assembly, and the disorders which had taken place in the country during its Sessions, combined with the anarchic activity of the political clubs, showed clearly that Persia was not ripe for representative institutions of a modern type. The grevious situation in Azerbaijan was by no means caused by Liberal movement in favour of a Constitution, but was anarchy organized by a brigand, Sattar Khan, with the aid of brigands from the Caucasus. The grant or otherwise of a Constitution for Persia would have no effect on the proceedings of Sattar Khan and his adherents. Mahmoud Khan said that the Shah was, of course, in favour of a Constitution ; all right-thinking Persians were of that opinion. But he regretted that the two Governments were, through their Representatives at Tehran, advising His Majesty to immediately grant a Constitution even before order had been introduced into the Administration, which was in a chaotic condition. The first need of Persia w T as that her finances should be placed on a better footing, and the next most urgent necessity was the reorganization of all Departments of the State. When the various branches of the Government had been reformed, and a good Administration was in working order, then an Assembly might be convoked, if it was possible to find competent men to compose it. In India and in Egypt His Majesty’s Government had established an admirable system of government, but they themselves did not consider that the moment had yet arrived for endowing either India or Egypt with a Constitution on modern European lines ; and Persia was far behind both India and Egypt. We wished to build a house in a hurry, before even the foundations were properly laid. The experience of the last Assembly had thoroughly disappointed all the intelligent and commercial classes in the country; and the peasants had no comprehension of an Assembly and had no desire that one should be established. If we forced on the Shah to promulgate an electoral law and the convocation of an Assembly we should plunge the country again into disorders, and we should both be compelled to intervene actively in the internal affairs of Persia. He knew that neither the British nor the Russian Government desired to adopt that course. He pleaded that the two Governments, who 'he knew were animated with the sincerest desire to benefit Persia, should devote their best endeavours to reorganizing the finances, to giving some pecuniary assistance to the Government, and to insisting on the thorough reorganization of all branches of the Administration. Their advice and assistance on these points would be invaluable. But he feared that if we both continued to insist on what was premature, and might be dangerous, we should defeat the objects we both had in view. I think that the above is an accurate summary of all that Mahmoud Khan told me. I did not interrupt him, as I wished him to unburden his mind ; but when he had concluded, J told him that I could not agree with what he had laid before me. In the first place the Shah had given both Governments solemn promises to carry out certain measures, and that hitherto he had failed to fulfil these promises. I did not believe that the majority of the population were against an Assembly; on the contrary, I was sure that they ardently desired it, and that if a Constitution were not granted there would be renewed troubles. It was quite possible that the last Assembly had many defects and shortcomings, but I was sure that among the educated and mercantile classes there were a sufficient number of men competent to be Deputies; and it should be possible for able men, and such did exist in Persia, to draw up an electoral law which should secure the return of those who had an interest in the well-being of their country. However, these were points on which those on the spot were far better able to judge than myself. All I could tell him was that neither the Russian nor the British Government would deflect from the course which they were now following. I asked [504] C18 him what were his plans. He said he was about to make a little tour to the European capitals. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. NICOLSON. No. 33. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received January 4.) (Telegraphic.)

Had His Majesty followed our advice in dealing with the Ispahan situation, or were he willing to do so even now, it might be possible to induce Samsam-es-Sultaneh eventually to retire, but His Majesty maintains his stubborn attitude in regard to this as he has done in regard to our advice on other matters. I doubt that in his penniless condition he will be able to send troops to Ispahan, and even if they go there is very little chance of their being successful. riot impossible that, after Samsam’s usurpation of power in defiance of the Shah at Ispahan, the example of the Bakhtiari will be followed by other tribes, e.g., the Kalhors at Kermanshah and the Kashgais at Shiraz. Though it may be too late to arrest the growing anarchy by the grant of a Constitution, which is a sine qua non of financial assistance, I consider that in the establishment of a constitutional regime lies the only hope of guarding against developments which it is impossible to predict with any certainty, but which might involve the disintegration of Persia, or at least the forcible dictation of terms to the Shah by the Nationalists.

We have not ceased to regard the granting of a Constitution as a factor of much importance in the restoration of order, and it may be that a wholesome influence may be produced on the Shah by the disturbances in those two places towards the granting of such a measure. So long as there is no reform in the Shah’s Government there will be no improve ment of a permanent character ; and while any proposals emanating from the Russian Government will be most carefully considered by His Majesty’s Government, they hold that to give the Shah money would, in the present circumstances, be worse than futile, and would amount to intervention in Persia’s internal affairs. For it is probable that such money would be employed in the suppression of the national movement on behalf of a Constitution; moreover, when once the money had been spent, the situation would be as bad as ever, even if not worse.Sir G.

Sir, Tehran, December 15, 1908. IN my telegrams of the past few days, I have reported the institution by the Shah of a Council of State, and 1 now have the honour to transmit a translation of the Regulations which have been issued for the working of this Council, and which have been informally communicated to me by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Nothing is said in this document as to the number of the members of this body, but I understand that it is to consist of some sixty Councillors, the majority of whom have already ffieen summoned to the meetings of the Council, as reported in my despatch of the 4th instant. It will be noticed that the Regulations now issued confer con siderable powers on the members. Indeed, given a Shah ready and able to co-operate in the work of reform, and given councillors endowed with intelligence and courage to make good use of their powers, it might well be that the Council would prove, for the present, better adapted to the needs of the country than an Assembly of Representatives of the people. Unfortunately, neither of these conditions is present. There is too good reason for thinking that the Shah, in granting the Council, is seeking to hoodwink the two Legations, and that he is as reluctant as ever to consent to any effective change in the rule of the camarilla with which the country has been cursed since the events in June. 1 understand that the membership of the Council is not yet complete, but its composition, up to the present, may, I presume, be taken as a fair indication of what it is intended to be. I need not trouble you with a list of the names. It will be sufficient to say that for the most part it is composed of ignorant and reactionary men. There are, I notice, one or two capable and independent members, but I am told that these regard the Council as a farce. Before Ala-es-Sultaneh gave me a copy of the new Regulations, my Russian colleague and I had asked for an audience for Mr. Churchill and M. Baronowski, in order to inquire of the Shah what measures he had decided to adopt with a view to the fulfilment of his engagements. As you are aware, His Majesty sought to evade this audience, pleading indisposition. It was evident that some delay must occur, and as wethought it desirable, on the appearance of the Regulations, that we should lose no time in making it clear to the Shah that we could not regard the institution of the new Council as a fulfilment of his engagements, and my Russian colleague and I decided to address a joint Memorandum in this sense to His Majesty.

Joint Memorandum communicated to His Majesty the Shah of Persia, THE Bepresentatives of Great Britain and Bussia have frequently advised His Imperial Majesty the Shah, in His Majesty’s interests and in those of his dominions, to fulfil the pledges in regard to the convocation of an elective Assembly which His Majesty has so often given to the two Bepresentatives as well as to his own people, and to proclaim an amnesty to his subjects in arms at Tabreez. The two Bepresentatives now venture respectfully to point out to His Majesty that the institution of the Council of Notables cannot in any way be regarded as a fulfilment of His Majesty’s promises, as its Members are not elected by the people, and they beg His Majesty to inform them when it is proposed to convoke the promised Assembly. In making this inquiry of His Imperial Majesty, the two Bepresentatives beg to repeat their conviction that the convocation of an elective Assembly and the Proclamation of an amnesty olfer the only hope of a termination of the present deplorable situation in the country. (Signed) G. BABCLAY, SABLINE, December II, 1908. No. 56. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey,—(Received January 18, 1909.) gi r) Tehran, December 29, 1908. I HAVE kept you informed by telegraph of the steps taken by the two Legations with a view to inducing the Shah to fulfil his pledges and restore constitutional * “ Instructions.” This word appears to relate to the present Rules and Regulations, and is evidently another word for “ Constitution.”26 government, and I now have the honour to report them in connected form by- despatch. In my despatch of the 15th instant I reported that, on the appearance of the Regulations defining the functions of the new Council, my Russian colleague and I presented a joint Memorandum to the Shah pointing out that the institution of this Council, the members of which were nominated by His Majesty, could not be regarded as a fulfilment of his promises. During the next day or two reports reached the two Legations that the Shah was wavering, and on the 16th instant Saad-ed-Dowleh sent word to my Russian colleague that he had a message from His Majesty which he wished to deliver to the two Representatives, and asking him to fix a meeting for the next day. The meeting took place on the 17th instant at this Legation. Saad-ed-Dowleh said that His Majesty had lately been pressing him to accept office and that he had refused, except on condition that constitutional government should be restored. This alone could save the country. Llis Majesty was now favourably disposed towards a Parliamentary regime, and had deputed him to ascertain from the two Representatives whether their Governments would make an advance of 400,000/. if he followed their advance. M. Sabline and I explained that such an advance could not possibly be made under the existing regime. It would, therefore, not be enough merely to promulgate an electoral law. Parliamentary government must be started, and it would only then be possible to devise the necessary guarantees for the proper spending of the money. Understanding that the Shah feared that these guarantees might involve the occupation of custom-houses or Persian territory, I said that the two Governments had no such thought, though naturally proper security for the regular payment of interest would have to be provided. It behoved the Persian Government at once to give M. Bizot every facility for studying the financial position, for thus only would he be in a position to indicate to the two Governments what guarantees were necessary. All this would take time, and in the meanwhile the Shah would do well to avoid any delay in making his good intentions known to the people, and Saad-ed-Dowleh, although we could not prescribe the details of a suitable Constitution, could count on the support of the two Representatives and our advice, should he require it, in his efforts to induce the Shah to publish the promised electoral law. Before leaving, Saad-ed-Dowleh intimated to me that numbers of persons were about to seek bast at the Legations,, and that the bazaars even might be closed. I strongly deprecated such a course, as likely to lead to disorders and hamper the action of the two Legations. On the following day Mr. Churchill and M. Baronowski again saw Saad-ed-Dowleh, who said that he had not seen the Shah, but had had our answer conveyed to His Majesty. M. Baronowski handed to him a scheme for a Constitution which he said had been prepared some time ago by a group of Persians. It was made clear by the two dragomans that they could express no opinion as to its suitability for Persia beyond saying that it contained clauses which would evidently require modification in order to make it acceptable to the Nationalists. We had intended abstaining for a time from further representations to the Shah and to leave it to Saad-ed-Dowleh to combat the reactionary influences surrounding His Majesty, but on Sunday, the 20th, events took a turn which seemed to us to render it desirable that we should renew our advice to His Majesty. For some days ygo ominous reports had been circulated that the foreign Legations were about to be invaded by bastis. I myself received applications fur bast from several quarters. Most of the Legations kept their gates carefully closed. On the evening of the 20th a small number of Nationalists sought refuge in the Turkish Embassy, their numbers being greatly increased on the following day. The Shah was believed^ to be on the point of yielding, and on the 21st Mr. Churchill and M. Baronowski sought an audience of him in order once again to urge His Majesty to lose no time in putting in hand the elaboration of the promised electoral law. Failing to obtain an audience, they made their representations to the Grand Vizier, who promised to convey what they had said to His Majesty and to secure an audience for them on the following day. They left his Highness with their impression strengthened that His Majesty was on the point of giving way. The audience next day took place just after His Majesty had received an important Nationalist deputation, which had come armed with a commentary on the late Constitu tion prepared by the highest^ clerical authority at Nejef, and tending to prove Article by Article that the Constitution was in accordance with the precepts of Islam. The dragomans found the Shah apparently very favourably disposed. He said he wished the two Representatives to know that he was resolved to carry out the promises he had made, and that he had all along intended to do so. ’The two dragomans then urged the Shah to lose no time in intrusting the elabora tion of the promised electoral law to the new Council. His Majesty said this was what he proposed to do, and he hoped that the new National Assembly and the Senate would he ready to work before the month of Moharrem (begins the :Mth January). On the dragomans endeavouring to obtain from His Majesty an undertaking in writing, which would enable us to persuade the bastis to leave the Turkish Embassy, the Shah seemed disposed to consent, hut said he must see the Grand Vizier first. His Majesty then withdrew, and a quarter of an hour later Mr. Churchill and M. Baronowski were joined by the Grand Vizier and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The former made great difficulty about the written undertaking, but finally it was arranged, with the consent of the Shah, that an engagement in the sense desired should be signed by the Grand Vizier and deposited with the Minister for Foreign Adairs, for the inspection of a delegate of the two Legations. The document was drafted forthwith by the two dragomans, and was to the effect that, on the day after the bastis left the Turkish Embassy, the Shah would issue a rescript, ordering the preparation of an electoral law by a Committee appointed by His Majesty to form part of the new Council. The promised document was not forthcoming at the appointed hour, but my Russian colleague and I thought it well to inform the Turkish Charge d’Affaires of the assurance which it had been intended to record. Sadreddin Bey, when I visited him, thanked me for our communication, and promised to bring it to the knowledge of his bastis, who, he said, numbered some 280. He feared, however, they would not be satisfied. At any rate, they would have to be given guarantees for their lives and property. These he was trying to obtain. Sadreddin Bey assured me that, when the first refugees arrived, he felt persuaded that their lives were in danger, and it was not until the next morning, when considerable numbers flocked to the Embassy, that he had any suspicion that it was intended as a political demonstration. On Christmas eve the dragomans again visited the Grand Vizier, to remonstrate with him for the non-fulfilment of his promise. They found his attitude entirely changed from their last interview. There had been a large meeting the day before at the house of Naib-es-Sultaneh, the Shah’s uncle, at which had been present the Ministers of State, leading members of the clergy, and other prominent reactionaries, the lesult of which was to fortify the reactionary influences in the Shah’s entourage, these had, I have since heard, been further encouraged by a report sent by tlm Persian Minister in St. Petersburgh of M. Isvolsky’s speech m the Duma, the report being so worded as to give the impression that the Russian Government did not care whether the Shah followed the advice of the two Legations or not. Anyhow, the Grand Vizier, when the dragomans saw him, showed all his old stubbornness, taking his stand on the ground that no form of Parliamentary government could be made consistent with Mahom- medan law. _ . . The absence of any satisfactory and tangible result of ouy representations is dis appointing. It is abundantly clear that we shall never succeed in inducing Mohammed Ali to make a serious effort to fill the role of a constitutional Sovereign until the Grand Vizier and the Minister of War are got rid of. _ The situation in Tehran is not free from anxiety. The arrests which have been frequent during the past few days have given rise to a feeling of panic among the Nationalists, and there is no doubt that unless the gates of the Legations were kept constantly closed they would all, especially this Legation, be at once invaded by bastis. The Nationalists have now had recourse to the closing of the bazaars as a demonstration, a step which is neyer free from risk, but which, in the present case, is fraught with more than usual danger m view of the active reactionary propaganda which the Palace entourage are conducting, and of the large numbers of unpaid troops in the capital who must be longing for an excuse for pillage. _ _ , The interests of public order thus make it highly desirable that the bhah should yield without delay, but, apart from this, there is another possibly imminent development which it seems to me very desirable to forestall. I am inclined to think that the agitation in the past few days has served to crystallize the aspirations of the Nationalist party, and that at no distant date we may find ourselves face to face with a definite demand for the restoration of the old constitutional regime without modification. So far-reaching a demand would add to the difficulties of reconciliation between the Shah and his people. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G.

Shah and Constitution, OiS the 8th December the official Gazette, “ Iran,” published an article on the new Council of State, the members of which would, it stated, be “ elected^ The Regulations for this Council were printed and published on the 11th December. On the 29th December the principal bazaars were closed, but were entirely reopened two days later. Sani-ed-Dowleh, the first President of the late Assembly, waited on the Shah with a deputation of Nationalists on the 22nd December, and submitted an admirably drawn-up statement of the reasons for which they urged His Majesty to re-establish the Constitution. The Shah received them well, and stated that he intended to do so. On the whole the situation may be described as somewhat critical, and it is impossible to foretell what difficulties the Shah’s obstinacy may not eventually lead to. As it is, the so-called “troops” collected at Bagh-i-Shah are a standing menace to the public. _ Comparatively trivial acts of violence on their part have been reported of late, but it is to be feared that as time goes on they may get completely out of hand and e\en attack private houses.

It Avill be remembered that a few days before the 23rd June, .1 elal-ed-Dowleh, Ala-ed-Dowieh, and Serdar Mansur expelled. Serdar Mansur, after staying in custody for several months at liruz Kuh, was brought to Tehran and detained in Amir Bahadur’s quarters at Bagh-i-Shah. He was told that he could buy his freedom for 60,000 tomans, He eventually succeeded in obtaining permission to go to his house for a feu hours, and availed himself of the opportunity to take refuge at the Russian Legation. The Russian Legation has used its influence with the Shah to obtain the release of seveial important political prisoners. His Majesty’s Legation is now endeavouring to do the same for the ex-Peputy of Tabreez, Musteshar-ed-Dowleh, who is still at Bagh-i-Shah. (Signed) G. P. CHURCHILL, Oriental Secretary.

On or about the 25th December the Turkish Charge d’Affaires received alarming telegrams from his Consular Agent at Resht, stating that numbers of Nationalists had taken refuge at his house, and that the local authorities threatened to use force to compel them to leave. Meshed. The situation in Meshed on the 1st December was serious. The Nationalists gained adherents every hour and the bazaars remained closed. Representations were* Se6 under “Meshed” iii previous ftiofrthly summary, page Ifi made to the Governor-General demanding a Constitution and a general amnesty, the latter to he counter-signed by both Consulates-General. The Shah telegraphed to the Governor-General and to the leading reactionaries to use their influence to disperse the Nationalists. The Shah added that the Kerbela letter was a forgery,* but the Governor-General was convinced of its authenticity, and has been endeavouring to discover how it reached Meshed, There is no doubt that this letter from the leading priests at Kerbela was in a great measure the cause of the crisis. During the 2nd December almost every man of importance joined the Nationalist party; the Governor- General was much alarmed, and stated that he could not rely on his troops. His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General was asked to forward a telegram from the Nationalist leaders to the Shah through His Majesty’s Minister. Captain Dranklin said he would send a precis of it. The telegram recounted how the late Shah and the present Shah had both declared that Persia was a constitutional country and they constitutional Monarchs ; that since the dispersal of the National Assembly the Shah had not retrieved his promise of a new one, but had been deceived by bogus telegrams, &amp;c., as to the true wish of the people in the matter; that the people earnestly desired a Constitution, and would act in accordance with the orders of the priests of Kerbela until it was granted them. Captain hranklin also received two letters in the same strain. One letter added that the people^ had taken, and would continue to take, every precaution for the safety and well-being of foreigners as well as of the people generally, and that they desired to maintain the friendly relations existing between themselves and the subjects of other Powers. A copy of this letter was also sent to the Russian Consul-General. In the second letter, the British Government was thanked for their friendly attitude towards the Constitutional party. n On the 3rd December the Governor-General withdrew his guns and pickets from the streets to the neighbourhood of the Ark. Practically all the leading reactionaries, finding the movement too strong for them, joined the Nationalists, who also received offers of assistance from outlying districts. They seized the telegraph office, but did not interfere with our signallers. The situation remained unchanged until the 7th December, on which day the Governor-General stated that the Shah had telegraphed that he would grant a sort of Cabinet of Justice if the people left the shrine and opened the bazaars. The Nationalists, on the other hand, demanded (1.) A local Assembly; (2.) A general amnesty ; and (3.) A delay of one month in the realization of the revenue* These demands were communicated to the Shah. On the 8th December the Governor-General asked Captain Pranldin to get him a loan of 1,000/. from the Imperial Bank to enable him to pay his troops, but this was refused by the Manager. The Nationalist loaders informed Captain Franklin that a local Assembly had been elected. On the 9th December Haji Abdul Rahim, one of the Nationalist leaders, visited the Governor-General to secure his consent to the following conditions :— (1.) Abolition of the Sarsang (a local grain tax). (2.) Non-realization of the revenue till the Persian New Year. (3.) The recognition of a local Assembly. (4.) General amnesty. The Governor-General gave his assent to all except (3)* There was much dissension among the Nationalist leaders, many of whom were suspected by their followers. On the 11th December the Governor-General informed the Nationalists that he was prepared to remove the Sarsang, dismiss the present Begler Beggi, and grant a general amnesty if the people would disperse. ^ These conditions were eventually accepted and the people dispersed, though the principal Nationalist priests and a representative of each guild remained in the shrine. Haji Abdul Rahim is credited with being the chief cause of this ignominous ending to the movement. AstfabacL Writing on the llth BeCeniber our Agent reported that Some 2,000 people assembled in a Mosque demanding the restoration of the Constitution. They werejoined by 150 Turkoman horsemen. Their leaders then interviewed the Governor, who declared that he was a Constitutionalist himself. The crowd then dispersed, hut the bazaars remained closed. Ispahan. Serdar Zafar (late Salar Arfa), who was instrumental in getting detachments of Bakhtiaris to go to Tabreez, has been using the favour he thus earned with the Shah to get his brother, Samsam-es-Sultaneh, deposed from the post of Ilkhani of the Bakhtiaris. The tribe is now divided into two parties, and trouble may be anticipated. Samsam-es-Sultaneh was summoned to Tehran by the Shah, but declined to go on grounds of health and because disturbances would occur in the tribe if he went. It is uncertain whether he retains his post of Ilkhani. On the 29th December a demonstration took place against the Deputy- Governor, and some 200 persons attempted to take refuge in the Consulate-General but were not allowed to do so. Yezd. Deports received from His Majesty’s Acting Vice-Consul contain details of some fourteen different robberies on the roads leading to Yezd. JNo road is safe, but the Kerman and Nain Doads are the most unsafe. Posts can only get throuo-h by circuitous routes. The robberies to the south are attributed to Lashanis amfother Tars tiibes, and the Governor of Xezd states that these tribes will continue to commit depredations until a strong Govern or-General is appointed, to Pars. Whatever be the truth of this, the Governor is responsible for the guarding of the roads in the lezd district. Unfortunately, he is a tool in the hands of Mushir-ul-Mamalek and badr-ul-Olema, and has intrusted the payment of the road guards to them. These two men have been trying to get road guards at half the rate of pay allowed by the oveinment. In tnis they have not been successful, and meanwhile many road guards, who have received no pay for seven or eight months, have deserted. The Governor stated to Mr. Blackman that he had appointed one Mohammed Taki Khan to take charge of the Ispahan Doad, and Mr. Lemon of the Telegraph Department was told to apply to this man for an escort. When he did so Mohammed Taki Khan merely laughed, and declined to give him an escort. Trade is going from bad to worse and will soon cease altogether. The town and neighbourhood of Yezd are likewise infested with bands of robbers, who visit the houses of wealthy Parsees, illtreat them, and rob them of all their household goods and money. A young Parsee was recently brought to the Church Missionary Society Hospital with one arm slashed off at the elbow. He had refused to guide a robber band to the house of a wealthv Parsee. Ihe robbers are often masked, but even when the Parsees can identify their assailants Liey dare not complain for fear of reprisals. In one case, when an appeal was made to the Governor, he declined all responsibility. An Armenian clerk of the Indo- Luropean telegraph Department was attacked in the street on his way to work by a man who attempted to deprive him of his great coat. The clerk produced a revolver, u lereupon ns assailant decamped. No soldiers are forthcoming for the duties of guards m Yezd, the present guard of the Imperial Bank of Persia consisting of two so-cafied artillerymen, unarmed save for one old sabre.

A strong Governor is required. The present Governor is Chief of a local tribe, and is afraid to act against all the other tribes, as he may any day cease to be Governor, and will then be at their mercy. A Itussian doctor on his way to Hamadan was recently attacked by tribesmen and compelled to pay a sum of money, but this was restored on his arrival at Ifamadan. Shiraz. The Province of Pars remains in a disturbed condition, and further robberies of caravans are reported. The latter part of November was marked by an agitation, which threatened at one moment to be serious, against the Governor and Ata-ed- Dowlek, Begler Beggi. All the principal merchants combined to send a telegram to Tehran, complaining of the impossibility of carrying on their business owing to the widespread disorder prevailing throughout the province. There was also a movement to close the bazaars, but this did not take shape. An inflammatory placard was posted up all over the city, calling on Shirazis to rise against the present regime. Salar-es-Sultan started on the 21st November for Lar. He has been warned by the Lari Seyyid against visiting Lar. Mr. Bill considers that the latter’s movement contains elements of real danger to the little order that remains. It seems certain that a force of Arabs, on its way to join Salar-es-Sultan, was severely defeated by villagers of the district, with a loss of some eighty killed. A^Parsee merchant, who is usually well informed, told Mr. Bill that he thought that if feoulat- ed-Dowleh was deposed from the post of Ilkhani of the Kashgai he would refuse to come to Shiraz, and would make the government of the tribe, if not of Shiraz itself, impossible, Soulat-ed-Dowleh had provided much of the ammunition expended in the Shiraz riots last year. He was disposed to keep in with the Government as far as the intrigues of his brother would let him, and had actually paid a consideiable portion of the absurdly light revenue of 16,000/. assessed on the Kashgais. This he was^ able to do owing to robberies on an unusually extensive and profitable scale, committed for the most part beyond the limits of Ears by roaming bands of Kashgais last summer. Soulat-ed-Dowleh would probably not discredit himself by an open alliance with the Lari Seyyid, but would give him valuable, though clandestine, support if dismissed from the post of Ilkhani. Sirdar Eirouz has left Shiraz, and it is reported that he will not return. Persian Gtjle. Bushire. Two large robberies were reported on the Shiraz road in the latter part of November, and travellers from the interior complained of being gieatly oppressed and ill-treated by the road guards. * I No. 58. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Eduard Grey.— (Received January 18, 1909.) gj r Tehran, December 80, 1908. I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith three Reports on the general situation in Azerbaijan which I have received from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabreez during the month. _ It will be seen that the city and immediate neighbourhood oi labreez are no longer the scene of hostilities between the Royalist and Rationalist paities, and, indeed, it is clear that the Nationalists have, since their final defeat of Ain-ed-Dowleh’s forces within the city, succeeded in maintaining comparative order and securing to the foreign residents an exceptional degree of protection during the recent troubles. Fighting has continued, since the time of Mr. Wratislaw’s last Report, in the direction of Maraga, and in the various encounters which have taken place, the Nationalists have been repulsed, as also in an attack which was made on Ain-ed- Dowleh’s camp at Basminch on the 6th December. . During the latter part of this month Ain-ed-Dowleh has been showing considerable activity, aifd, besides endeavouring to cut off supplies from Tabreez, has been interferinguith the postal service between that place and Tehran. I have made a protest to the Persian Government on this subject. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. Inclosure 1 in No. 58. Consul-General Wratislaw to Sir G. Barclay, TTATn? « . Tabreez, November 1%, t 1 T • ^ 16 . nour submit the following remarks on the situation at Tabreez as I find it on resuming the duties of my post:— • Since the retirement of the Shah’s forces the town has been entirely in the hands o. attar Khan and Bagher Khan, and the military party. A rump Anjuman still exists, but it has little or no say in affairs, though meetings are constantly held which any one who pleases attends. Ijlal-el-Mulk informed me last week that he had resigned his position as Governor, finding it untenable in view of the arbitrary conduct of Bagher Khan, but 1 understand that he still retains the functions of a figure-head, and that Sattar Khan intervened to patch up a truce between him and Bagher Khan. There ha-ve been rumours of dissensions and rivalry between Sattar and Bagher, but I do not think that the friction amounts to much at present. Order is fairly well maintained within the town, indeed the quarter inhabited by . ® Christian anil foreign element seems as safe as ever it was, and I notice no change “ ™ “j? 6 ?*- Foreigners generally speak with gratitude of the attitude towards them ot the Nationalists throughout the troubles, and, with the exception of the Russians, show no apprehension for their personal safety. M ,. Th ® ““ty groipd on which serious exception can be taken to the conduct of the ™ 18 S 1S P lao Ii ce °f levying forced contributions on the richer native members ol the community, whose reluctance to pay up is overcome by threats of assassination, and, m some instances, by the infliction of corporal punishment. Money has, however, o e oun somehow for the payment of the troops, who, in the case of natives, receive trom 2 to 6 krans a-day each, while volunteers from the Caucasus get as much as 1U krans. Receipts are given for such contributions, but it is highly improbable that accoun s vy e\ei be rendered or that the leaders refrain from keeping a considerable percentage in their own pockets. °PP;f tunIt y afforded by the lull in active operations has been used to revictual the town, and very considerable stores of grain and flour are now stocked in the Ark for uture emergencies. For these supplies the Government share in this year’s crops has een commandeered from the neighbouring country districts, as well as much of the gram due to the landlords. Here again receipts are given for what is taken. these exactions naturally embitter the persons concerned, and the sufferers grumble a good deal m secret at the existing state of things. It is obvious that it cannot go on me ehmteiy for Tabreez is living on its capital, and when that is exhausted it is difficult to see how the local “ army” is to be maintained. a -vr t consiclera ff 1 ® distress in the villages which were devastated by the Karadagh and Maku horsemen Most of their cattle were driven off by these brigands, and, consequently, many farms remain unploughed and unsown, a dismal prospect for next yeai • . .jP . !

He returned to his own place round about Sainkaleh on receiving the news of the Nationalist occupation. Bahadnr-es-Sultaneh had orders from the Shah a month ago to join Ain-ed-Dowleh with all his forces, but he declined to do so, on the pretext that his own country was being attacked by Shahsevend raiders.

Owing to the irrregularity of the post I have no news of what is going on at Salmas, beyond the report that the local Enjumen has been re-established. Nor are any precise details to hand concerning the murder of Ikbal-es-Sultaneh, the Maku Chief, and there seems even to be some small doubt as to whether the people of Tabreez were not premature in their rejoicings on this event.

Inclosure 4 in No. 58. Consul-General Wratislaw to Sir G. Barclay. gi r&gt; Tabreez, December 2, 1808. SINCE the date of my last Report the Nationalist cause has received a rather serious set-back at Maraga and Binab. Both these places were occupied without difficulty by a force sent from Tabreez, which only just anticipated the Chardowleh horsemen coming from the west. Besides exacting the usual pecuniary contributions from friends and foes alike, the Nationalists indulged at both places in excesses which fortunately have not hitherto been the rule, and at Binab the inhabitants rose against them and drove them out of the town with considerable loss. The Chardowlehs seem to have helped, but details are lacking, and the affair is given as little publicity as possible. The evacuation of Maraga immediately followed, but it is probable that an effort will be made to recover that- place. The two leaders of the expeditionary force were imprisoned on their return to Tabreez and one, I hear, bastinadoed. From Salmas, too, fighting is reported between Nationalists and Makulis. The former receive considerable assistance from Armenian “ fedais,” who are strong in the district. An Anjuman was elected nearly a fortnight ago at Urumia on the initiative of Muhteshem-es-Sultaneh, but it is a colourless Assembly, and not likely to last for long. The only road stations now held by the Russians are those at Julfa and Yam (between Sofian and Marend). The main station at the Aji Bridge outside Tabreez has remained vacant since the fight there, in spite of the request of the Anjuman that it should be reoccupied, and their offer to place a guard at the bridge for the protection of the employes. Persons who have recently visited Basminch report the situation of Aimed- Dowleh’s troops to be very bad. Many of them are sick, and they suffer much from cold and privation. Winter has set in early this year, heavy snow has fallen already, and the weather is very cold. It seems that unless an attack is made at once on Tabreez it will have to be postponed till the spring.

Barclay had been good enough to repeat to me regarding the situation both at Tabreez and Ispahan, I called on M. Isvolsky yesterday and gave him the substance of what I had received. I pointed out to his Excellency that the country seemed rapidly to be approaching a state of disintegration, and that it was of the highest importance that the two Governments should come to some understanding as to what measures should be taken to endeavour to prevent the movement from extending. It was believed that the Shah was about to issue a rescript establishing a Constitution, but I would be grateful if he could give me the Memorandum which he had been elaborating, so that my Government might examine without loss of time the proposal which he had formulated. He said that owing to the Christmas holidays he had been unable to finally conclude the Memorandum, but that he hoped to give it to me at the latest on the 13th instant. M. Isvolsky observed that the situation in Persia was certainly most disquieting; semi-independent or practically independent Governments were being established both at Tabreez and atIspahan, and the authority of the Shah seemed to be in process of dissolution.' He much doubted if the mere announcement of a Constitution would be sufficient remedy to the very grave condition of affairs. He need not reiterate his oft- repeated assurances that the Russian Government had not the slightest desire to intervene ; it would be against their interests to do so, but circumstances might prove too strong. He was glad_ to say that although Sattar Khan was assuming the rights of an independent authority, the Julfa-Tabreez road was open, caravans were passing unmolested, and hitherto no_ Russian subject had been assassinated or maltreated. Oriental countries had a curious way of emerging from situations which appeared hopelessly entangled, and usurpers of authority suddenly became its loyal supporters ; still the situation was critical, and he would be glad to hear what were the views of His Majesty’s Government. He was glad to hear that the Saad-ed-Dowleh had been appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs, and was inclined to co-operate with the two Legations. I told his^ Excellency that though matters might possibly have gone so far that the proclamation of a Constitution might not allay the agitation, still there could be no objection to still insisting on its issue, as it might do some good. I agreed with him that the mere promise or enactment even of a Constitution would not be a universal cure ; still it was a step in advance. * - • I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. NICOLSON. No. 60. Sir G.

His Majesty’s Consul-General to-day reports that the Bakhtiaris have arrested the official delegated by the Persian Government to collect taxes, and are trying to raise a loan of 20,000 tomans on this security. They are provisioning the town and are erecting fortifications. Some 150 Bakhtiari are reported to have left the city on the 17th instant for Murchikhar, and the number at present in Ispahan is about 1,500.

Baiclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received January 19.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, January 19, 1909. I RECEIVED a visit this morning from a leading member of the late Parliament, who came to see me on behalf of some Tehran Nationalists. He said that they heard that the establishment in Persia of some measure of control was being contemplated by the British and Russian Governments, and he explained that his party desired either that the two Governments should only intervene so far as to secure the re-establishment of the Constitution, by which good government could not of course at once be secured, but which would go half-way to gain it, or that England and Russia should leave the Shah to settle matters with his people, and abstain from all intervention. He said that the Nationalists realized the necessity of foreign advisers, and that the next Medjliss, which would act with more wisdom than the last, would call them in; but what the Nationalists particularly desired to avoid was the imposition-of foreigners by the two Governments. In reply, I said that the restoration of a constitutional regime alone had been aimed at in the representations made by the two Representatives, and that as these had now failed, further representations, and of the nature of which I could tell him nothing, were now being considered by His Majesty’s Government and the Russian Government.3G No. 62. Sir Edward Grey to Sir A. Nicolson. Sir, Foreign Office, January 20, 1909. THE Russian Ambassador called at this Department on the 13th instant and spoke to Sir 0. TIardinge on the subject of affairs at Ispahan. Sir C. Hardinge told Count Eenckendorff that, according to the information which I had received, the Samsam and his Bakhtiaris had declared themselves on the side of the Nationalists at Ispahan; that the Barman Parma had no intention of going there at present; and that the Bakhtiaris, who were escorting the Deputy Governor, were not hostile to the Samsam. Sir C. Hardinge added that under these circumstances it was, in my opinion, desirable to await developments. Until the Shah reforms his Government and puts it on a footing which inspires confidence, it is useless for him to send a Governor or troops to Ispahan. Nor do I think that any good purpose would be served by our attempting to influence the Samsam until His Majesty listens to our advice, as such a course would only result in our advice being equally disregarded on both sides.

Sir At Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 22.) 4 St. Petersburgh, January 1?, 1909* X HAVE the honour to transmit copy of a memorandum which I received last night from M. Isvolsky regarding the measures which might be taken by the Govern^ ments of Bussia and Great Britain in view of the deplorable situation in Persia. M. Isvolsky requested that I would call on him this afternoon, as he would like to have a talk with me. I called on his Excellency this afternoon and he asked me what I thought of the memorandum. I told him that I did not notice any allusion to provision being made for elected members of the Council which vras to elaborate an electoral law. M. Isvolsky remarked that he had not wished to encumber his pixqjosals with details, or to prescribe too closely the composition of the Council. He had mentioned hommes de merite, and he remarked that elections would take time, and discussions v ould ensue as to how and from what classes they were to be elected, and so forth. It was best to hasten on the work of the Council. In icgard to a loan, it seemed to me, I said, that this question was by no means piessmg, and that it had better be left alone until M. Bizot had made his report, which should be asked for, as a loan might perhaps not be necessary at all. His Excellency agreed with this view, and said that he had thrown out the idea of a loan if one should be required, and had sketched the control which it would, in that case, be necessary to institute. lun Ex 1 cellenc y said Eia ^ Ee l iad made the control as innocent as possible, and as 1 d c J . , lcind as possible. ^ If a loan were accorded, some supervision was absolutely essential over the mode in which it was expended. I then said that, in regard to an advance, I was quite sure that my Government would not entertain the proposal, in any case until an electoral law had been elaborated anc pu) 18 lied and dates fixed for the elections and for the convocation of an Assembly. v n replied that he quite appreciated what I said, but that he had care- u y, m the memorandum &lt;£ if the Shah gives sufficient proofs of his decision o tollow the advice of Bussia and England.” He had purposely left the conditions to an advance vague in phrase, as we should then be perfectly free to decide whether the proofs afforded by the Shah were or were not sufficient. We might quite rightly say that we were not satisfied, until an Assembly had met or elections had been held, or ay don n any other condition; but he thought it should be left to the Bepresenta- n\es on ic spot to inform their Governments when they considered that the Shah had given such proofs of his good faith as would justify an advance being made, under conditions, to the Persian Government. It must not be forgotten, however, that some funds of a modest amount must soon be given, unless we wished to see thement representatif, dont la necessite avait ete reconnue par lui-meme, mais sans insister sur le retablissement de la forme dans laquelle ce regime existait en 1907-8, lui conseiller de procdder sans delai, a 1’aide des personnes mentionnees an § 1” et dn Conseil de 1’Empire actuel, ainsi qne d’autres hommes de merite, a Telaboration d’nne loi instituant nn nouveau corps electif qui repondrait aux us et coutumes historiques du people persan, ainsi qu’a ses idees religieuses, satisferait a ses besoins et contribnerait a 1’etablissement de la paix et de 1’ordre en Perse. 3.

Cette avance serait destinee a subvenir aux depen ses immediates necessitees par Tintroduction des reformes. Saint-Petersbourg, le 3 (16) janvier, 1909. (Translation.) THE state of affairs in Persia, far from improving, becomes^ daily more involved, and the condition of the country is becoming very serious. Affairs in Azerbaijan arc growing worse : the power of the Shall is merely nominal, the struggle bctu ecu the parties Continues, the import trade is gradually decreasing; the revolutionary party lias recently compelled all payments due from the Indo European lelegraph Company to be made to the Tabreez local assembly. Disorders have also recently broken out at Ispahan, which town at the present moment is in the hands of the Bakhtiaris. The people of Meshed refuse to pay their taxes. The situation in Ghilan and in various other provinces is no less threatening. A section of the Mujteheds of Nedjet aie distributing proclamations throughout the entire country, in order to incite the people against the Shah, calling upon them to defend their rights and privileges. ^ Ihe Shah s treasurv, on the other hand, is empty, and the army, as well as the administration, are unpaid, and are compelled to live by plundering and preying upon tae peacea )lc population. If events continue in this direction, no one can foretell where the disorganisation of the Empire of the Kajars will cease. _ _ _ ., The economic interests of Russia and England having recently suffered consider ably from the disorders in Persia, the two Powers should take the present situation m the country into serious consideration, and should devote themselves to devising a plan of action with a view to avoiding further complications which might compel them to depart from their passive attitude as regards events in Persia. _ In strict conformity with the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of Persia, the British and Russian Governments have hitherto restricted themselves exclusively to giving the Shah friendly advice to re-establish the constitutional icgime, abolished after the events of the 10th (23rd) June, 190S. The two Governments adopted this line of conduct with the conviction that the restoration of the absolutist rename in Persia was impossible, and that the realisation of the people s wishes by t le Shah was the only method of pacifying the country. At the same time Russia and England clearly realise that the re-establishment of the Persian constitution m a form similar to that which existed prior to the dissolution of the Medjliss is equally undesirable, as the country would thereby only be thrown into a still deeper state of anarchv. The first Medjliss, which was dependent upon the revolutionary anjumans; gave unmistakable proof of its complete incapacity to guide the affairs of the country in a new direction. This opinion is shared by a considerable number of the better i r' A i 1J 4:40 class ^ people in Persia, who left the progressive party to join the ranks of the reactionaries. To this fact is chiefly due the doubts raised in the mind of the Shah. In these circumstances the Imperial Government consider that pressure on the Shah in order to obtain the re-establishment of the constitution will not of itself attain the object which the two Powers have in view. If the pacification of Persia as well as the establishment of a stable order of things is desired, it is indispensable not only to set up a rational form of representative government but also to assist the Shah’s Government at the same time to introduce the essential reforms, first and foremost of which comes the reform of the finances, and then the administrative the military, and the judicial reforms. Contrary to the generally accepted idea, Persia is a rich country possessing con siderable resources; this fact has been testified to by, amongst other people, JVli. Mailing, formeily Pritish charge d affaires at Tehran. The valuable resources of the country have, however, been wasted. A portion of the revenue is made away with by the corrupt administration. The remainder is expended without any real benefit to the country, thanks to the totally inadequate financial system, if, in truth, it is possible to speak of a financial system at all in Persia. One branch alone of the resources of the State is organised on a firm basis; that is the customs. Ever since M. Nans and his Belgian assistants organised the Customs administration in Persia the revenue from them has considerably increased; it has at the present time attained a sum of about 5,000,000 roubles per annum. Deducting from that amount a sum ot 2,500,000 roubles appropriated annually for the service of the loans contracted by “A, 82 ’ 00 ?’, 000 , roubles frora the Ban( l u e d’Escompte et de Prets de Perse, and 2,o00,000 roubles from the Imperial Bank of Persia, we arrive at a sum of 2,500 000 roubles annual net revenue which remains in the hands of the Persian Government, Another source of revenue, which might attain considerable proportions, but which unfortunately does not do so owing to the complete lack of organisation in the Euiopean sense of the word, is the rnaliat or tithe imposed by the Koran on irrigated lands. 1 he major portion of this tithe imposed upon the taxpayers in exeessivelv heavy proportions and with a severity approaching to cruelty, is almost entirely appropriated by the officials of the administration through whose hands it passes for payment into the Treasury, which in reality receives but a very small share. Einallv the 1 ersian Government have at their disposal a third source of revenue which if piopeily regulated, would enable them to maintain a considerable armed force. This source of revenue lies in a special military tax which the population is compelled to pay to the Government for the maintenance of a certain number of soldiers, which by virtue of an immemorial custom, the people have to provide for the Shah. A lar^e proportion of these soldiers are in reality never called to arms; the remainder are j. ‘..• v l’ ai&lt; or ! lot l ,alcl at al *&gt; an( l tl'o sums which ought to provide for the maintenance ot the armed iorces are appropriated by members of the administration. 16 resources of the country are, it will he seen, considerable, and in order that its adLinistmtion PreSeilt P0SitiOn ’ “ ' 0uld be to organise its finances and thnf k wfll SIlal1 • deCldeS t°. enter sincerely upon the path of reform,it is most probable le,iail i e a certam sum °f money to defray the expense entailed by the suffiSiW^o 0 , 1 , 1 , ° f - 11S /° U t 1 i ltry ' f h0 a c ° tUal recei P ts of the p ersian Government are bufficient to piovide for the service of a new external loan even of a considerable amount; the sum ot 2,500,000 roubles which remains from the revenue of the customs u ould alone suffice to pay interest and sinking fund on a loan of some 32,000 000 roubles I is, however, quite possible that Persia may be in a position to dispense withTloan of these dimensions ; she could perhaps confine herself to instituting a serious control ver ier present receipts so as to increase their yield, and she would onlv require AonfthSaTofr a eform OUnt t0 ^ “P 1 ™ 68 110cessitate 4 V ^r first steps If the British Government concur in the point of view set out above the Imnerial ° f T‘T desi ?T d to ^guard the economic interests oi Itussia and Lngland in Persia, and which might he formulated as follows it cannot be doubted that at this moment Persia can only extricate herself from L'S I P0S «7, n by rr 0fl T 0, ' mS = amo ^ st ' vhich are tobTreckoned leloimo m the finances and the realisation as tar as possible of the desire expressed bv the population to obtain some form of representative government. * ^ Y\ itli this object in view Itussia and England could— 1. Without m any way departing from the recognised principle of non-inter- wm ion m the internal affairs of Persia, recommend in a friendly way to the Shah thatlie should call to power capable and energetic men, who have already given proof by their action of their desire to assist their country in extricating itself from the difficult situation in which it is placed, such men as Saad-ed-Dowleh, who has elaborated plans of representative institutions in Persia, and who, as a matter of fact, has just been appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Nasr-ul-Mulk, who, as President of the Council and Minister of Finance, has drawn up plans for reorganising the finances of Persia and the maliat laws, as well as the first plan of a regular budget; 2. TFhilst expressing to the Shah the desire to see a representative Government established in Persia, the necessity of which he has himself recognised, but without insisting upon the re-establishment of the form in which that Government existed in 1907-8, advise His Majesty to proceed without delay, with the assistance of those men mentioned in paragraph 1, of the present Council of the Empire, and other men of merit, to prepare a law instituting a new elective body, which would he in accordance with the historical usages and customs of the Persian people, as well as with their religious ideas, and which would satisfy its needs and contribute to the establishment of peace and order in Persia; 3. If the Shah gives sufficient proof of his decision to follow the advice of Hussia and England, lend him the support of the two Powers in concluding an external loan, more or less considerable in amount, on the condition that a special Committee composed of the directors of the Itussian and English banks at Tehran, and of Persian delegates, he instituted ; this Committee— (a.) Would control the expenditure of the resources of the State, and would see that expenditure rvas devoted exclusively to the needs of the country; (b.) 'Would superintend the preparation of the estimates of the annual appropriations for all branches of the administration, as well as the manner of applying these estimates in conformity with the budget, Avhich Avould be drawn up by the Department of Finance with the assistance of the Committee of Control ; and (c.) Would assist the Shah’s Minister of Finance in the revision and regularisation of the maliat laws. 4. In order to give the Shah’s Government a proof of their friendly feelings towards Persia in a moment of such difficulty, Russia and England would he ready to put at her disposal an advance of 5,000,000 fr. out of the loan to be concluded. This advance would be devoted to defraying the immediate expenses necessitated by the introduction of the reforms. St. Pelersburgh, January 3 (16), 1909. No. 64. Sir G.

Memorandum io be communicated by Sir A. Nicolson to M. Isvolsky. HIS Majesty’s Government have examined with much interest and careful attention the detailed Memorandum, communicated by the Russian Government to His &gt; Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Peters burgh on the 3rd (16th) January, m regard to the deplorable situation which has arisen in Persia, and the measures which it may prove expedient to adopt. , After full consideration of all the circumstances, His Majesty s Government are disposed to think that the best course to adopt would be for Great Britain and Russia ■ to stand entirely aloof from the internal affairs of Persia, allowing the existing chaos to endure till whatever element in the country is strongest gams the day. During this interval, they would be prepared to face the danger which might be involved to British commercial interests. , .... .. , His Majesty’s Government, however, cannot but recognize that it would be more difficult for Russia to maintain this attitude as she has a frontier and settled district^ which are coterminous with the most disturbed part of Persia. ... If therefore, the Russian Government adhere to the view that it is impossible for Russia’ to adopt’ the course which His Majesty’s Government consider would be ' advisable, they are prepared to co-operate with the Russian Government m legald to future action. . „ , His Majesty’s Government share the apprehensions of the Russian Government m regard to the present situation in Persia, and they agree that, until representative Government is established, the condition of the country is not likely to improve. - iey are indeed assured from reliable sources that, if a Constitution were granted, tran quillity would be restored over the whole of Persia. They therefore think that, for the present, the efforts of tlm two_ Governments should be directed towards inducing the Shah to fulfil his promises m this respect. _ Dealino* with the several proposals of the Russian Government in the order^ m which they &amp; are enumerated, His Majesty’s Government would submit the following considerations :— 1. They gladly welcome the suggestion that the two Governments should advise the Shah to call to his Council able and energetic men, capable of assisting His Majesty in drawing up a scheme of representative Government. As a corollary to this, it would be advisable to recommend His Majesty at tlie same time to dismiss reactionary advisers such as the Grand Vizier and Amir Behadur Jang, who aie believed at present to be the chief opponents of a popular policy, and ^ to be largely responsible for the situation of affairs at Tabreez and Ispahan. His Majesty s Govern ment would further suggest, with a view to reconciling Azerbaijan and Ispahan, that the Shah should be induced to proclaim a general amnesty for all his subjects under armg 2. His Majesty’s Government entirely concur in the proposal to advise thq Shah to elaborate at once a scheme of elective Government in conformity with the civic ideas of the Persian people. TT .' . . . , This advice has already been given to His Majesty on more than one occasion by the Representatives of Great Britain and Russia, but hitherto with no lesult, and it may be feared that the Shah will continue to disregard it, unless he is convinced that such a course will have inconvenient results to himself. His Majesty’s Government therefore suggest that a date should be proposed to the Shah beyond which the fulfilment of his pledge should no longer be postponed, and that it should be intimated to His Majesty that, unless a form of representative Govern ment suited to the needs of the country be granted by a named date, he will get no support of any kind from the British and Russian Governments^ who will reconsider their attitude to His Majesty and take measures to safeguard their interests. 3. His Majesty’s Government consider that the question of a loan is by no means pressing, and that it had better be deferred until the issue of the Financial Adviser’s report, which they understand is likely to be ready in a few weeks.

BIZOT tells me that the Persian Government are now showing a real desire to help him in his investigations into the fiuancial situation. They at last realize that whatever other conditions may be attached to the financial assistance of the two Powers, it is a sine qua non that the real situation should be made clear to M. Bizot. They have now told off two capable officials of the Ministry of Finance to assist him, and they meet three times a-week for their work. It was until recently M. Bizot’s aim to secure the preparation of a general Budget, but the further he has gone in his investigations the more convinced he has become that it would be useless to attempt to put a Budget in force with the present machinery of the Finance Department, which suffers from the radical defect of an entire lack of centralization. What M. Bizot says is needed is that the local Treasurers, who are now at the mercy of the proviucial Governors, should be completely withdrawn from their authority and placed solely under the orders of the Minister of Finance. This can only be done by the introduction of a non-Persian element in the administration, and M. Bizot thinks the best course would be to appoint two Europeans as Treasurer-General and Inspector of Finances respectively. ^ No Persian could have enough authority to give the local Treasurers the backing required to enable them to withstand illicit demands from the Governors. With authority thus centralized in competent hands, and with a properly salaried staff—it is worthy of remark that in none of the statements given to M. Bizot, purporting to show items of expenditure, is there any reference to the payment of salaries of officials, except those in the Diplomatic and Consular services, and these are notoriously in arrear—there would be every reason to hope that a Budget could be put in force. M. Bizot tells me that he is now turning his attention to the question of the cost of the financial administration if thus reformed. In any case it would need but a small portion of the 400,000L which it has been proposed that the two Governments should advance. During the visit at which M. Bizot gave me the above information he asked me if there had been any change in the views of the two Governments as regards the financial assistance to be rendered to the Persian Government. I told him that, so far as I knew, there had been no change in the attitude of His Majesty’s Government, and that they were still only disposed to consider a joint advance of 400,000/. when adequateguarantees for the proper expenditure of the money were forthcoming. This could only be when a constitutional regime was in working order. M. Ostrogradsky, the Russian Financial Agent, to whom I have also spoken, is in full agreement with M. Bizot as to the need for centralization of the financial administration in the hands of a competent European. It is impossible to say with any approach to accuracy what is the present annual deficit. According to figures, which both M. Bizot and M. Ostrogradsky think reliable, the revenue at the disposal of the Central Government, after meeting local expenditure, should, if the taxes were paid, amount for this year to some 5,612,000 tomans ( 1 , 100 , 000 b)! Fo reliable statement has been furnished of the expenditure, but M. Ostrogradsky thinks that it exceeds the revenue by not less than 500,000/. I'have, &amp;c. ’ * (Signed) G. BARCLAY. No. 78. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 15.) ® ir ’ Tehran, January 26, 1909. DURING the month of December considerable unrest became manifest amongst the population of Ispahan owing to the extortion, practised by Moadil-el-Mamalek, the Deputy Governor, and the generally oppressive methods of administration employed by Ikbal-ed-Dowleh, the Governor-General. The agitation, which was encouraged and to some extent engineered by the clergy, culminated on the 28th December in an attempt made by a crowd of some 200 persons, mostly small shopkeepers, to take refuge m His Majesty s Consulate-General. Upon Mr. Grahame refusing to admit these malcontents, they retired to the Masjid-i-Shah (the chief mosque), after giving Mr. Grahame a telegram setting forth their grievances to be sent to me for trans mission to the Shah. The crowd in the mosqufe increased during the following days, a aige number ol inhabitants from the neighbouring villages arriving to join in the movement. Early on the morning of the 31st some persons took refuge in the Russian Consulate-General. Negotiations between the Governor-General and the chief priests for the restoration of order were in the meantime' being conducted, and it is possible that a peceful solution of the situation would have been found had not, on the morning' ot the 2 nd instant, Zargham-es-Sultaneh with a force of some 100 Bakhtiaris arrived m the town and proceeded to the mosque to join the people there. The Governor-General thereupon ordered his troops to fire on the crowd, and in the course of the fighting, which lasted during the greater part of the day, some twenty persons were killed and a good many wounded, most of whom were innocent spectators of events. Cannon were also fired by order of the Governor in the direction of the mosque, but no loss of fife occurred though a portion of the buildings of the mosque was damaged. Before evening the Zargham-es-Sultaneh had gained possession of the chief strategical points m the city with the exception of the artillery barracks, and the Governor, desisting from further attempts to overpower the Bakhtiari, ordered his soldiers to loot the bazaars m the vicinity of the palace. Some 800 shops were looted, the amount of damage done being estimated at between 200 , 000 /. and 500,000/. It may be noted that no British firm suffered any direct loss. The Governor-General, with the Karguzar and other local authorities, took refuge in His Majesty’s Consulate-General on the same evening, a number of servants and soldiers of the Malair Regiment also taking oast the next day. On the following day more Bakhtiari arrived under Muntazem-ed Dowleh, and m the course of the day the Bakhtiari gained possession of the palace and artillery barracks; the soldiers, until then under the orders of the Governor-General leaving the town or taking bast in the British Consulate-General. Oil the morning, of the 4th the Governor’s palace was completely sacked, and in the afternoon Samsam-es-Sultaneh, followed by some 800 Bakhtiari, appeared in the town and was received with acclamations by crowds representing all classes of the population. ° As the result of the telegraphic conversation which the Russian Charge d’Affaires and I had with Mr. Grahame and the Russian Consul-General on the 3 rd, we had urged le Shah to dismiss Ikbal-ed-Dowleh from the Governorship and to hand over pro visionally to bamsam-es-Sultaneh the office of Governor, adding that the Persian Government would be held responsible for the lives and property of our nationals. This in spite ol representations which we renewed on the 5 th, His Majesty refused to doalleging that he had no confidence in Samsam-es-Sultaneh. On the following day Prince Farman Farina was appointed Governor, and it was arranged that pending His Highness’ departure, a deputy should leave, accompanied by 300 Bakhtiari, in a few days. These left on the 13th instant. In reply to Prince Farman Farma, by whom my Bussian colleague and I were approached in regard to our attitude in the situation, we replied that we only desired the maintenance of tranquillity, and that we had instructed our Consuls to tell Samsam-es- Sultaneh that we looked to him to keep order, and also to urge him to do nothing which would make a peaceful solution of the present difficulties impossible. Samsam-es- Sultaneh, in conversation with Mr. Grahame, has more than once expressed his loyal and conciliatory intentions, and has emphatically denied that he has made himself Governor of Ispahan. He protests that he is willing to retire upon receiving a guarantee for his personal safety, and after having secured for the people of Ispahan the constitu tional rights to which they are entitled ; but he adds that if armed forces aie sent against him, or against the city, he will not abandon the people of Ispahan, noi will they him. , . Since his arrival at Ispahan order has been kept, and guards for foreign firms have been provided from the Bakhtiari forces, which now number sonie 1,500 men. A Provisional Assembly (“ Anjuman-i-Muvakkati ”) has been formed, which has held meetings to discuss proposals for holding elections; and a loan of 20,000 tomans, repayable within twenty days out of the “ Maliat,” on the guarantee of about foity leading personages, has been raised to meet the Bakhtiari expenditure. Though at the beginning local grievances of the small tradespeople and inhabitants of the neighbouring districts, more especially in regard to land taxation grievances which were shared by the Bakhtiari—may be said to have been tne predominating feature of the movement, there is little doubt that the ease with which the town was gained encouraged Samsam-es-Sultaneh to turn to good advantage so favourable an opportunity for consolidating his position in the leadership of the tribe. ^ It is more difficult to estimate the extent to which Nationalist sentiments have inspired the Bakhtiari leaders, though from the more recent information I have received it is evident that Samsam-es-Sultaneh has now thrown in his lot with that party. I may add that Mr. Grahame obtained for Ikbal-ed-Dowleh from the local Assembly a written safe-conduct, and a verbal promise from Samsam-es-Sultaneh of a Bakhtiaii escort, and that, on condition that Mr. Grahame should accompany him one stage and should send a Consulate servant with him as far as the second, he had consented to leave His Majesty Consulate-General on the 24th instant. In view, however, of the Governor’s past record, and in order to limit as far as possible the responsibility of His Majesty’s Government for his safety, I felt unable to sanction Mr. Grahame s proposal to accompany Ikbal-ed-Dowleh. There are, in all, at present about 200 peisons in icfuge there. Mr. Grahame has succeeded in inducing a number to leave, there having been originally some 500 soldiers and others in refuge at the Consulate-Geneial, who weie with much difficulty kept under control.

I HAVE the honour to report, in continuation of my despatch of the 30th December, that at the beginning of this month the Nationalist forces of labreez suffered a serious defeat at the hands of the Governor of Maraga, and the majority returned to Tabreez. Skirmishing continued during the first fortnight of the month between the Nationalists and the troops of Ain-ed-Dowleh and those of the Governor of Maraga with no very definite result, and since the 16th instant, with the exception of an engagement which terminated successfully for the Nationalists, with the Maku tribe near Julfa about the 23rd instant, no hostilities have taken place and Sattar Khan has ordered his men to remain within Tabreez. This is to be attributed to the extreme severity of the weather. _ . A more interesting development of the Nationalist policy, and one which might have had far-reaching effect, has been the demand of the local Assembly that the receipts for local traffic on the line of the Indo-European Telegraph Company shouldI see that M. Isvolsky doubts whether the mere grant of a Constitution can do much good . 0 It is obvious that of itself it will not suffice to bring order out of chaos, but it still offers the best chance of an improvement in the situation. Any attempt to bolster up the present autocracy by financial assistance coupled with the imposition of reforms must prove abortive, unless it is accompanied by a large measure of foreign control. What is now urgently needed is that some satisfaction should be given to the nationalists. It may already be too late; but were the Shah to convoke a National Assembly and at the same time to proclaim a general amnesty, there would be at least a good chance of Tabreez and Ispahan returning to their allegiance, and other ambitious tribal Chiefs would be deprived of a pretext for emulating Samsam-es-Sultaneh. The situation would thus be relieved and a respite given for the introduction of such reforms as are most needed for combating the general anarchy, such as the reorganiza tion of the financial administration and the establishment of a proper gendarmerie and police. It would be vain to hope that such reforms could be effected without foreign assistance in men and money, for however true it may be that if order were restored and the finances properly administered the revenue would suffice for the needs of Government, it is certain that as things are to-day money for reforms is not to be found in Persia, and men capable of directing reforms are equally lacking. If constitutional government is to have a fair chance, money must be found for Persia as soon as the new regime is working. The Shah has been persuaded to consent to the appointment of a European Treasurer-General and Inspector for the Ministry of Pinance, a measure which should bear fruit if these officers receive the support of Parliament. Poreign instructors will be needed for the gendarmerie and police and foreign advisers for some of the Ministries. Indeed the possibility of reform without foreign control depends not only upon whether the Shah can be brought to work honestly with a Parliament, but also upon whether a Persian Parliament can bring itself to co-operate with and support foreign agents of reform. In neither respect was the experience of the last Medjliss promising; but I am given to understand by people better able to form an opinion than I am that the more enlightened among the nationalists now realize that foreign advisers will be necessary, for a time at least. This, however, is looking far ahead. Por the moment the most pressing need in the • interests of the country and in the interests of the principle of non-intervention is that the Shah should be brought promptly to fulfil his promises and at the same time to grant a general amnesty. A slight departure from this principle now may avert the necessity of a more far-reaching one later. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. * I No. 81. Sir G.

MY Russian colleague is sending a telegram to his Government, of which the following is the substance :— “ In view of the grave situation in the country the Shah himself realizes that it is impossible for him to continue his present disastrous policy. His Majesty has asked my advice, but I cannot give him any which would have a practical result. “ The delay in granting reforms has created a situation where it will be difficult for tbe Shah to calm his people by half measures. Nor would a moderate Constitution, which might have sufficed four months ago, now satisfy Tabreez, Ispahan, and Resht. Tbe people know the feebleness of the Shah too well to yield, and it is only due to the concentration of troops in the capital that the Shah remains on the throne. “ I think the Shah’s hesitation is in great measure due to his uncertainty as to the reforms to be proposed by the two Cabinets, and if the two Representatives had positive and formal instructions they could more easily bring, the Shah to grant a Constitution by friendly advice, which he would have to follow rather than lose the much-prized sympathy of the two Powers, and possibly his throne.” I concur in M. Sabline’s opinion, and I consider that the Shah is in grave danger of losing his throne unless he can be brought to. dissociate himself from the reactionary party, and place himself at the head of the Nationalist movement.

IS VOLSKY said to me yesterday that he could not understand the strong objections which His Majesty’s Government took to providing any means which would enable the Persian Government to start a fairly workable Administration. It was of no use to insist on the Shah enacting an electoral law and summoning an Assembly and leaving the Government in an absolutely penniless condition. He himself desired to propose something practical, and in no country in the world could any useful results be expected if there were not the wherewithal to make a beginning. I told M. Isvolsky that my Government could not furnish the Shah with means so long as there was no certainty that he would in reality establish a constitutional regime. ' It would simply be strengthening his hands' to resist the Nationalist movement. M. Isvolsky said that he did not wish to give the Shah any funds. He had gone as far as he could in meeting the wishes of His Majesty’s Government. What he proposed was in brief the following : to insist on the Shah dismissing reactionary advisers and calling to his councils competent and liberal men j to grant an amnesty ; to proclaim an electoral law and to fix dates for the elections and for the convocation of the Assembly. When all this was accomplished, then, but not till then, a moderate advance should be made—not to the Shah, but to the lefoimed Persian Government io meet the immediate needs of the moment. The disbuisement of this advance was to be carefully controlled and supervised, and to be solely devoted to the legitimate purpose of setting the administrative machinery going. Suiely the above were reasonable and practical proposals. Wlien there w r as some piospect of introducing a better administration, surely the whole proceeding was not to oe blocked owing to the want of funds ; and yet His Majesty’s Government declined to assist in giving these funds until an Assembly had accorded its approbation. Ine Shah was to be urged to grant concessions which he considered dangerous, and no hope was to be held out to him that if he w T ere reasonable the Governments would see that assistance v r as rendered so as to give some stability to the Adminisf ration. His Majesty s Government had not experienced, as the Russian Government had experienced, the serious inconvenience and danger of the present situation. The Russian Government could not permanently endure a continuation of the general unrest and disorder in tho north. They were anxious to see liberal institutionsintroduced and established, and his proposals were sufficient evidence of that desire; hut they were firmly convinced that it was imprudent in the highest degree to have an Administration with an empty Treasury and unpaid troops and employes.

Sir, Tehran, February 23, 1909. 1 HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copy of a despatch from Mr. Gardner, now in charge of the Vice-Consulate at Resht in Mr. Rabino’s absence, reporting on recent events in that town, -which, after the assassination of the Governor, Sardar Afkham and two minor officials, have resulted in its detachment from the Shah’s authority. As reported in my telegram of the 16th instant, Sipahdar, who arrived at Enzeli just before the outbreak at Itesht, was detained by the dominant faction in the latter town and accepted from them the governorship. On the 20th Eebruary the local Assembly addressed to the five principal foreign Representatives in Tehran a telegram protesting that they had no quarrel with the Shah, and declaring their determination to put an end to the present situation, which they attributed to the evil policy ol His Majesty’s entourage, and to recover their national rights. The telegram concluded 'with a warning that in executing the necessary measures for their own protection damage might be caused to the Resht- Tehran road and traffic along it impeded, but that in that event the Shah himself and his advisers would be responsible. A “ gholam ” of the Russian Legation who recently travelled by the Resht road reports that the Nationalists were fortifying places along the road, but there has been no interference with traffic, nor is there likely to be if only the Shah will be guided by the advice which has been given him by the Sipahdar not to attempt to subdue the town. Some hundreds of troops have left Tehran, but have not yet got beyond Kazvin. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY.58 Inclosure in No. 108. Acting Vice-Consul Gardner to Sir G. Barclay. Sir, Reshf, February 9, 1909. I HAVE the honour to report that yesterday, the 8 th instant, towards 4 p.m. an armed gang set out from the house of Moiz-es-Sultan, brother-in-law of Sardar Mansur, and, making for the Governor’s house, at once proceeded to open tire on the soldiers and guards. Some of these replied and a fight ensued. The regulars were, however, soon bested, and tbe revolutionaries, taking possession of the two cannons, turned them against the Government House. At the same time they set tire to some outhouses and the “ anderoon ” at the hack, and some of the party went along the main streets, tiring in the air to intimidate people and disarming all soldiers on patrol duty. Whilst the foregoing was taking place another section of the rebels proceeded to the Mudirieh garden, where the Governor (Sardar Afkham), the Sardar Motamed, and the Sardar Homayun had gone to lunch. The insurgents announced their arrival by exploding a bomb and then entered the house. Accounts as to what followed vary to such an extent that it is impossible to get at the truth, hut the fact remains that the Governor was shot dead whilst the other two were taken home by their attendants more dead than alive. The killed are said to he about twenty and include two rebels. On the other side the chief names are those of Mosteshar Daftar, Government Supervisor of the Ghilan revenues, and Azaz-el-Mamalek, sent recently from Tehran as Government Mamoor. I also regret having to report the death of one, Kass Agha, “ferrash,” of this Vice Consulate, but I have so far been unable to discover under what circumstances. The ringleaders of the movement are Mois-es-Sultan and his brother, Karim Khan. The latter returned to Resht unknown to any one some two days ago. The telegraph wire was cut, and I was therefore unable to avail myself of this means of communication. This morning the town w as quiet and no disturbance took place throughout the day. The National Guards patrol the streets. A temporary Anjuman has been formed to look after town matters, and has elected Sardar Homayun and Sardar Molitamed joint temporary Governors. They have further issued a manifesto telling the peojde they have nothing to fear, the movement being solelv aimed at the authorities. I have. &amp;c. (Signed) ' A. E. HAYRES GARDNER. No. 109. Sir G.

I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith the usual monthly summary of events in Persia during the past four weeks. I have, &amp;e. (Signed) G. BAPCLAY.Inclosure in No. 110. Monthly Summary. Tehran. THE Cabinet, which remains unchanged, is composed as follows : Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Minister for Eoreign Affairs 5&gt; 5&gt; 35 Minister 33 War Justice Education and Public Works for Telegraphs Court Commerce Einance .. Mushir-es-Sultaneh. Saad-ed-Dowleh. Sipahsalar. Nizam-ul-Mulk. Mohandis-ul-Mamalek. Mukhber-ed-Dowleh. Sultan Ali Khan (Yazir-i- Durbar). Mufakher-ul-Mulk. Kawmm-ed-I)owleh. The main interest of the Ministerial situation has centred in the struggle between the Sipahsalar and Saad-ed-Dowleh, which may be considered as the struggle between the frankly reactionary and the mildly liberal influences around the Shah. Neither side has yet scored any definite success. The customary Moharrem ceremonies were much curtailed this year owing to the scarcity of money and the fear of disorders. The usual passion plays were not performed in the Eoyal Theatre, but were represented on a much smaller scale in Bagh-i-Shah. The revolution in llesht has greatly encouraged the Nationalists at Tehran and since the 13th February the bazaars have been more or less closed. The number of refugees in the Turkish Embassy and at Shah Abdulazim has largely increased and the agitation has become much more general. A general feeling of uneasiness pervades the town. The disloyalty of the population has undoubtedly increased, and the Nationalists are beginning to hint at the necessity of a change of Sovereign even if the Constitution is granted. Since the closing of the bazaars the Government has taken extraordinary police measures. Patrols are much in evidence while soldiers and gendarmes are stationed in the bazaars and principal streets. With a view to frightening the people into opening their shops four traders were publicly bastinadoed, but this severity only resulted in more shops being closed. On the 22nd February, three men were arrested on the charge of being about to throw a bomb. One of them was summarily executed and his corpse hung up near the Bagh-bShah Gate as a warning to the populace. The other two are now being tried and an attempt is being made to implicate other persons. The man who was executed and one of his companions having been in “bast” at His Majesty’s Legation last June, representations were made to the Persian Government, as reported by telegram. This incident has greatly exasperated the people who believe that the man was executed on a trumped up charge. On the 24th February, a murderer was publicly executed evidently with the object of still further frightening the people. The reactionaries are spreading all sorts of rumours of Nationalist disasters at Tabreez, the fall of which they believe to be imminent. However, they are undoubtedly very uneasy as to the possibility of disorders in the capital and the general precariousness of their position, although the military force at the disposal of the Shah should suffice to prevent any' successful rising here without help from outside. The Shah shows no sign of granting the Constitution and is evidently hoping for the speedy fall of Tabreez, which, he believes, will cause the collapse of the Nationalist movement. The trial of the persons accused of complicity in the attempt on Sheikh Fazlullnh has resulted in the release of all the prisoners except one, whose trial is still proceeding. Farman Farma is still at Tehran, and he informed a member of His Majesty’s Legation that he had definitely decided not to proceed to Ispahan. His deputy, Sardar Motezid, returned to Tehran on the 4th February, but left again two days later to rejoin the expeditionary force at Kum.Salar Asliraf, one of the Eakhtiari Khans sent against Ispahan, also returned to Tehran, hut left again for Kum, Some 400 men of the Hamadan Regiment sent against Tabreez have returned to Tehran apparently being unwilling to endure the hardships of the expedition. ’ 11 ^ (Signed) W. A. SMART. Tehran, February 24, 1909. Meshed. Telegraphing on the 17th February, Major Sykes reported that a large body of raiders from Fars had crossed the desert, and were threatening Jabas. The Governor-General was sending some troops to that place, Ihe Yezd load vas blocked. Kerman. A band of robbers assembled early in January at Kermanshahan on the Yozd road, intending to waylay caravans bringing ammunition and bank specie. A force was sent out which compelled them to withdraw, and the cara^ ans came through safely * Telegraphing on the 16th February, His Majesty s Consul reported that the popular party was becoming active and trouble was brewing, that the Governor was afraid of the people, who would break out as soon as they realized that this rras the case, Yezd. The new Governor, Adl-ed-Dowleh, arrived on the 23rd January. Throughout January the roads leading to Yezd have remained in the hands of robbers, and though occasionally a caravan, if escorted, got through, this was not always ’the case. The bands of robbers sometimes number as much as 100 men. Complete insecurity prevails, and the Farsee community remains in constant fear of molestation. On the 11th February some 100 Parsee men, women, and children, inhabitants of hamlets round Taft, rushed the British telegraph-office demanding sanctuary. The Governor, on being addressed on the matter, arranged for the removal of the Parsee to the Parsee quarter of the town. A party of 200 Bakhtiaris was reported to have arrived about the 20th January, some 30 miles south-east^ of Yezd. It appears that the Governor sent out a force to coerce the j_aftis, against whom the Parsecs had complained, but a skirmish resulted in favour of the Taftis. When asked what they wanted the latter replied “ the establishment of the Constitu tion.” The news of this answer seems to have thrown the Governor and the townspeople into a panic. The Governor and Notables armed theii folloveis, barricades were erected, and obsolete guns mounted. Even the guards at European premises were withdrawn, but, as the result of His Majesty's Vice-Consul’s remonstrances, subsequently sent back. The Taftis were said to be acting on orders from Nejef. Kermanshah. On the 20th February Captain Haworth reported that the Chief Priest of Hamadan had informed him that he had received instructions from the Chief Priests at Kerbela to request all Consuls to inform their Legations that news of the two Powers giving a loan to the Shah had reached them, that the Shah had no right to receive a^ loan^ authority for which rested with the National Assembly, which was now represented by the local Assembly at Tabreez, and that the people could not be responsible for any money given to the Shah. The anti-Nationalists of Hamadan, hearing of the disturbances at Resht and of the Chief Priest’s action, went to the latter and informed him that they too desired the Constitution. The Chief Priest has told the Acting Governor that if he is not able to come to the town to govern it he is prepared to assume the government himself of those Avho demand the Constitution. It is probable that a local Assembly will be formed shortly. Shiraz. The operations undertaken by the Kawam-el-Mulk against the Lari Seyyid have not yet led to any definite result, ‘The Governor-General, .Asaf-ed-Dowleh, appears to have little or no power*62 the administration being mostly in the hands of Sirdar Firouz. There have been repeated rumours of an intention to get up a riot against the Governor-General. The latter, in an interview with Mr. Bill, asseited that he was doing his best to settle British claims, hut Mr. Bill thinks that British merchants have no chance of recovering any of their lost merchandize except by direct compensation from the Fars Govern ment, an idea the Governor-General refuses to entertain.

IN continuation of my despatch of the 26th ultimo, I have the honour to report that the situation at Ispahan remains unchanged. The town is quiet, and order is being maintained satisfactorily. The negotiations between Samsam-es-Sultaneh and the Bakhtiari Chiefs from Tehran, who are now at Kum, continue, and it is fairly certain, though the reports are conflicting, that no clear understanding has as yet been reached between them. The troops sent by the Shah have none of them proceeded beyond Kum. Prince Farman Farma remains in Tehran. I learn that Samsam-es-Sultaneh has been in communication with Soulet-ed-Dowleh, Ilkhani of the Kashgais at Shiraz, but so far no move has been made by the latter. A few days ago Samsam, suspecting that messages were passing between Tehran and Shiraz without, as usual, going through the Persian office at Ispahan, threatened to cut the telegraph line, and I have instructed His Majesty’s Consul-General to warn him unofficially against such an act In reply to Mr. Grahame’s message, Samsam stated that he wished to have control for the next few days over all messages passing to Shiraz, with power to suppress any which he found distasteful. He added that if this were not conceded, he declined all responsibility if the line were cut After con sulting with Mr. Barker, it was decided that if the Persian Government asked for the unusual facilities for communicating with Shiraz to which Samsam objected, they should be refused, and Samsam-es-Sultaneh has been informed accordingly. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. P.S.—Since writing the above I learn that Samsam-es-Sultaneh is not satisfied with the above assurance, and has informed His Majesty’s Consul-General that his delegate must be permitted by the Indo-European Telegraph Department to inspect all telegrams passing between Tehran and Shiraz through'the British office in Ispahan. After consultation with Mr. Barker, I am informing the Persian Government that I have found myself compelled to advise the Department to accede to Samsam’s demands. G. B. No. 112. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received March 15.) Sir, Tehran, February 25, 1909. IN continuation of my despatch of the 27th ultimo, I have the honour to report that at the beginning of this month Ain-ed-Dowleh offered to negotiate forpeace with delegates of the local Assembly of Tahreez. Nothing, however, came of these overtures, as both parties, fearing treachery, were unwilling to send delegates. An engagement of some importance took place on the 6 th instant outside the town, in which the Nationalists lost six men, and the Royalists, who were eventually driven back, fourteen. During the month the Royalist troops have succeeded in completely investing Tahreez, the three roads to Juba, Ramadan, and Kazvin being blocked respectively by the Karadaghis, by the forces of Samad Khan, Governor of Maraga, and by Ain- ed-Dowleh. Consequently provisions in the town are becoming scarce, and the store of grain is not expected to last more than six weeks. A determined attempt was made on the 22 nd instant by a strong force of Nationalists to open the Julfa road and to release the garrison of Marand, but after an attack on the Karadaghis at Alvar the expedition returned to Tabreez unsuccessful. The Court party at Bagh-i-Shah has been lately very confident that the fall of Tabreez would be only a matter of days, but from all the information I have received from Mr. Wratislaw it is evident that the estimate of the forces at Ain-ed-Dowleh’s disposal is much exaggerated, and Mr. Wratislaw thinks it impossible for them to take the town by assault. It may be starved into surrender, but it will be pretty certain to hold out so long as provisions last, for the Nationalists know that they can hope for no mercy from Rahim Khan if he once enters the town. Fighting is also reported from the districts round Urumia. The position of traders in Tabreez is very bad, and British merchants have complained to Mr. Wratislaw of the grave injury to their affairs occasioned by the closing of the Julfa road for the European post and merchandize. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. P.S., February 26.—I inclose copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabreez, which has just reached me. Inclosure in No, 112. Consul-General Wratislaw to Sir G. Barclay. gj r Tabreez, February 7, 1909. THE loss on the Nationalist side in the engagement of the 5th February turns out to have been rather more serious than at first believed. Exact figures are difficult to obtain, but I believe that the total casualties amounted to quite fifty men killed, wounded, and missing. The skirmish led to no result beyond the retirement of the Royalists to their camp at Sardemd, which they would have been obliged to regain at nightfall in any case. It illustrates the lack of discipline and competent control on the Nationalist side, and their poor fighting qualities in any enterprise outside their barricades. Some of Ain ed-Dowleh’s troops from Basminch took part in this engagement, and 1 understand that a number of them are now permanently attached to Samad Khan’s force. _ # _ . It is uncertain whether Rahim Khan has himself arrived on the scene of action, but his son, with a force of Karadaghis, is in the neighbourhood to the east of the Julfa road, and Samad Khan’s men who are extending westward from Sarderud are in touch with him and render the road unsafe. In fact, Tabreez is now practically beleaguered. No provisions can enter the town, the fruit-trees in the gardens are being cut down for fuel, and though there is^ at present a sufficient supply of corn for the food of the population the pinch is being severely felt in various ways. There is considerable discontent among the mercantile community, who do no business, and yet are continually called on for contributions to the cause which they dare not refuse so long as their means last. The finances of the Nationalists are not very prosperous, and it is a question how long they will he able to continue paying their troops. Their share of the receipts of the Indo-European Telegraph office for January only amounted to 12,000 krans, while no contributions from their friends have come in lately. At the same time, very little money goes out of the town, and I do not think that there is any inuuediate prospect of a collapse for lack of it.64 The general opinion is that the Royalists will shortly try to take the town by assault, but it is doubtful it they could succeed ; and a blockade, if maintained for two or three months, would, in all probability, force the Nationalists to surrender. On the other hand, the Shah is hardly in a position to keep his men together for so long, I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. C. WRATISLAW. No, 113. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received March 16.)

His Majesty promised to consent to this suggestion. I am informed by Saad-ed-Dowleh that he made this proposal to the Shah in the nope that an authoritative pronouncement in favour of a Constitution might be oblained from the meeting. If the composition of the meeting is not like that of the farcical Council of December, and the Nationalists consent to attend, some useful results may be hoped for.

I HAD a conversation yesterday with the Russian Charge cl’Affaires, who expressed himself as appiehensive that, if the Royalist brigands at Julfa were to massacre women and children under the very eyes of the Russians, the intervention of Russia in the affairs of Persia might possibly become inevitable. -fr * 1 * * * * * i cply, I expressed the fear that the Shah still desired to see the intervention of Russia, which would be considered to be in his favour. It was my firm conviction that His Majesty would lose no time in proclaiming a Constitution, the immediate result of which would be to alleviate the situation all over Persia, if once it was made clear to him by the Russian Government that intervention would not be of the slightest advantage to him, but would in all probability result in his being dethroned on account of his inability to govern his country.

During that period the Nationalist party should defer giving their final reply. In the meantime they would ascertain their duty from the other centres of the Nationalist movement or His Majesty’s Government should produce documents in proof of their claim, .&gt; “ The following is the present position : Seyyid Murteza is a fanatical half- educated Mullah. His control of the situation is merely due to the fact that he can at any moment call to Bushire from the hinterland, of which he is a native, a horde of Tangistani riflemen as he did on the present occasion. The number actually here is about 1 , 000 , but others are coming in daily. The Persians, whether Nationalists or others, have no faith in the personal integrity or bona fides of the Seyyid, and it may be assumed that merchants will, so long as he keeps his control of the situation, import and clear as little merchandize as possible, consequently receipts will be very low. The petty depredations of the Tangistani riflemen keep the native population of Bushire in perpetual fear, and they very generally express the opinion that nothing can restore tranquillity short of some kind of intervention on our part. In view of the desire of His Majesty’s Government to avoid action of this nature as long as possible, I am replying, pending further instructions from you, to the Seyyid, whose personal attitude is outwardly cordial to His Majesty’s Piesidency, that I note with pleasure his protesta tions of friendship, but that I cannot consider that British interests are in any way safeguarded by his offer, and that I shall treat his proposals as a basis for further friendly but serious negotiations between us. “ Until I receive further instructions from you I will try to persuade the Seyyid to reduce the amount of the receipts retained by him daily and to obtain bis consent to some suitable temporary arrangement by which the balance may be placed in safe custody ; also to get him to reduce the number of riflemen, and to secure the association with himself of some reliable persons for the transaction of current local affairs.” No. 139.

Even thus, owing to the cost of necessary reforms, there would still be a deficit for some years.

Its amount cannot be determined until a programme of reforms has been prepared and the claims of theseother creditors, principally holders of unmet havalehs, have been examined. M. Bizot has been shown a statement, according to which the outstanding havalehs previous to 1908 amounted to 540,000/. This sum must have increased since then, but there would doubtless be considerable reductions on the examination of the claims of the holders. In conclusion, M. Bizot emphasizes the desirability oi the prompt appointment of a European Treasurer-General. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. No. 169. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey .— (Received April 13.) gi r Tehran, March 23, 1909. IN continuation of my despatch of the 23rd ultimo, I have the honoui to lepoit on events at Resht during the past month as follows : _ . As reported in my telegram of the 1 st March the Minister for Foreign Allans communicated to me, in a note dated the 28th February, a telegram adchesse by the Council of Ministers to the Ulema, Notables, and inhabitants of Ghilan denouncing the Sipahdar, exhorting them to abstain from insurrection, and threatening innocent and guilty alike with loss of life and property in the event of a concentration of the Imperial forces on Resht to suppress the movement. . On the 2 nd March the Acting Vice-Consul at Resht telegraphed that for the time being there was no fresh development, but that twenty or thirty Caucasians arrived by every steamer, and that the mail steamer due that day was expected to bung ty Russian Cossacks as a Consulate guard. The guard did not, however, land until the 20 th March. On the 22 nd March I received a telegram from the provincial Assembly of Ghilan, copies of which had been sent to the other foreign Representatives m Tehran, reminding me of the constant efforts of the Nationalists to insure the safety of foreign subjects. . , M1 In conclusion, I beg to transmit copy of a memorandum by Mr. Churchill reporting on the situation and the control established by the Nationalists over the northern portion of the Resht-Tehran road, along which he recently passed on his return from Europe. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. Inclosuie in No. 169. Memorandum by Mr. Churchill. WHEN I passed through Resht a few days ago I called on Serdar Homayun and Serdar Motamid, from whom I received accounts of the events which occurred there on and after the 8 th February last. I also called on Sipahdar, who had expressed a wish to see me, hut a member of the revolutionary committee was present throughout the It was made quite clear to me, both from what I saw myself and from the accounts I received from various sources, that the entire movement at Resht was planned in the Caucasus and carried out by a band of determined Caucasians not exceeding fifty in number. These have been added to during the six weeks which have since elapsed, and,^ I was told, now number roughly 350. In the meantime a considerable number of Persians who were in exile have come to Resht. Three brothers, the nephews of Serdar Mansur, known respectively as Muiz-es-Sultan, Amid*es-Sultan, and Kenm Khan, have throughout taken a very prominent part with the Caucasians. The bazaars were open and trade was pursuing a normal course, Red nags were displayed at nearly every house door, and those not flying the revolutionary emblem either displayed a’ Russian or a Turkish flag, indicating that the inhabitants claimed the protection of those Powers. I also observed two British flags. Sipahdar in the course of conversation, declared that he was determined to support80 10 Constitution, and that in the meantime he would maintain order in Kesht so loim as loops were not sent against him. If, however, troops were sent, he could not answer lor the consequences, though he seemed confident of being able to deal with any force the biiah might be able to send. 1 deprecated such acts as the detention of Shoa-es- U , an ? f Sipahdar informed me that he had so far opnosed this step on the paid of the Caucasians, that lie had threatened to abandon Resht if they persisted in their course. J r It was quite clear that the apparently fortuitous arrival of Sipahdar on the scene on the occasion of the murder of the Governor had been carefully prearranged by the Caucasians, but I am equally convinced that neither Serdar Homayun nor Serdar Motamid were taken into the confidence of the conspirators, though such, I believe to be the general suspicion. It is inconceivable that these two timid persons should have gone to the card party at Mudirieh on the fatal Monday (the 8th February) knowing that a band of Caucasians would forcibly enter the house with the determination to nor a nd one or two others supposed to be reactionaries. They would if e ) had been m the plot, most certainly have found some excuse to avoid beinj? under dh 6 not lven\ ,°n ^ ” eV6n shot ^ ™ istake - as Ca^casiaS Mndiwk Ind V' if 1 &gt; ° f Cfi Pa f J b - V Slgllt - Muiz -es-Sultan directed the party at i t ’ i , u ™s elf f ound the Governor who was attempting to hide, and held him by the coat whde the Caucasians killed him.

The destruction of the villao-es in the eighbourhood of Julfa and the barbarous treatment of the inhabitants £y Rahim Khan have, as reported in my telegram of the 22 nd, formed the subiect of a mint representation to the Persian Government by my Russian colleague and myself JOn the 3rd instant the telegraph-line of the Indo-European Telegraph Company was cut between Tahreez and Julfa by Rahim Khan. The telegraph employes of the Company were unable to go out of Tabreez and repair the wire, through fear of Rahim Khan’s men, and, in spite of the orders which Ain-ed-Dowleh declared he had given, Rahim Khan refused to allow the Tabreez representative of the Company to execute repairs. The Russian Charge d’Affaires had in the meanwhile made a strong protest to the Persian Government, and had put forward on behalf of the Company a claim of 500/. a-day during the period of interruption. His representations, which I supported, eventually resulted in direct orders being sent to Rahim Khan, and communication on the line was restored on the 19th. I have, &amp;c. ^Signed) G. BARCLAY. P.S.—I transmit a copy of a despatch from Mr. Consul-General Wratislaw, giving an account of the fighting on the 25th ultimo and 5th instant. The last paragraph briefly describes the devastation wrought by the Shah’s troops. G. B. Inclosure in No. 170. Consul-General Wratislaw to Sir G. Barclay. gj rj Tabreez, March 7, 1909. OF the two assaults on Tabreez by the Maraga army under Samad Khan the latter was undertaken with larger forces and pressed with greater determination, but even in the first, on the 25th February, unexpected courage was shown by the assailants, and though the defenders were never very hard pressed, the presence of Sattar Khan in person and several hundred men was necessary before they were finally driven back. The attack was made from Saderud, and the fighting took place in the orchards before the Nationalist outpost at Khatib. One Royalist was taken prisoner, and ten corpses were picked up close to the Nationalist defences. From the traces of blood on the snow it was plain that a larger number of dead and wounded had been removed earlier in the day by their friends. The Nationalists lost three killed and five wounded. # ^ a j i j. On the 2 nd March Samad Khan transferred his head-quarters from Saderud to Karamalek, a large village to the east, and considerably nearer to Tabreez, and at daybreak on the 5th instant a large mixed force of Chardowleh cavalry and Persian infantry, with one gun, advanced along the roads leading to the suburbs of Ahoum and Hukmabad. They effected an entrance into Hukmabad, but instead of pursuing their advantage the Chardowlehs commenced pillaging the houses, and thus allowed Nationalist reinforcements time to come up, and by 4 o’clock both attacks were repulsed and the Royalists in full flight. They were even unable to remove the greater part of their loot from Hukmabad, and five prisoners were taken, besides trophies in the shape of Samad Khan’s drum and the donkey carrying his lunch. Twelve Royalist cor P se ® were picked up and brought into the town, and their total loss in killed and wounded must have been very considerable. . The Nationalists lost five killed and ten or a dozen wounded. Ibis assault excited great apprehension in Tabreez, as Hukmabad is virtually part of the town, and the Royalists had not previously come so close or shown such determination. A number of mollahs joined the Nationalist forces in the defence, and though it is not to be expected that the reverend gentlemen did much actual execution, their presence certainly encouraged the fighting men. n i On this as on all other occasions Sattar Khan showed distinguished personal courage, but he exposes himself far more than should a commander on whose life the whole Nationalist cause in Tabreez depends. In the abortive attempt to open the Julfa road on the 22 nd February he was for a time in the greatest danger, being hR b y the mass of his men with only a handful of Armenians in a critical position, from which he extricated himself with much difficulty. He also proved his humanity on the 5th instant by interfering at some personal risk to save prisoners from the hands of an infuriated mob. # . . t -n ^ ok+U The proceedings of the Basminch army are quite incomprehensible. On the ^otn February they supported the attack on Khatib by a feeble bombardment of the Khiaban quarter, which only resulted in two Nationalists being wounded. This bombard [504] ’ ^ment was resumed next day with a similar lack of effect, and the barricade at which the three guns were firing all day was not once hit on either occasion. Some damage was done to the gunners by Nationalist rifle fire. During the attack on Hukmabad on the 5th Khiaban was again bombarded, hut on this occasion the Nationalists attacked the position occupied by the Royalist artillery, and the guns were hurriedly withdrawn some time before Samad Khan’s assault was repulsed. A determined assault on Khiaban would have prevented Bagher Khan, who commands in that direction, from sending reinforcements as he did to Sattar, and the latter’s position might well have become critical. r lhe same day a small detachment of Royalist cavalry appeared before the outpost at Khatib, and the defenders withdrew to their inner position, taking their guns with them. The post was, however, reoccupied the same day. from the statements of prisoners it appears that the Royalist soldiers have all been instructed that the Tabreezis have become Babis, and that it is therefore a religious duty to fight them. Since the Indo-European telegraph line was cut by the Karadaghis little is known of the proceedings of these brigands. It is, however, reported, I believe with truth, that they have occupied Marend and are threatening Julfa. They pay no attention to orders given them by Ain-ed-Dowleh, and last week two travellers, a Greek and a Swiss, proceeding to Julfa with a safe-conduct from him were robbed of all their possessions. I he bread question in the town has not yet become acute, though the amount served out is barely sufficient for the daily needs of the population. On the 28th I ebruary a baker was executed for selling flour above the rate fixed by the Anjuman, after due warning, and on the next day a reactionary suffered a like fate for treason. The general state of the country is indescribably bad. From Zenjan to Basminch the villagers, who have been despoiled of their all by the Royalist troops, take to the road and rob in their turn any one they can catch. The Karadaghis on the Julfa road have looted everything within reach. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. 0. WRATISLAW. No. 171. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 13.) Sll '&gt; . . Tehran, March 21, 1909. 1 HE Nationalist movement has now spread to the ports of the Persian Gulf, lushire and Bunder Abbas have thrown off their allegiance to the Shah and passed without bloodshed under the control of the Nationalist party. At the end of February the Resident at Bushire reported that Sevyid Murteza A lire mi, one of the leading Mollahs in Bushire, was endeavouring to bring about the dispatch of a number of J angistani tribesmen into Bushire for the purpose of creating a distui bance. Major Cox addressed the local Government urging them to take precautionary measures if there was any truth in the rumour. The Acting Russian Gonsu L-General consulted Major Cox, and further representations were addressed to the eput} Governor, who replied that he was taking the necessary steps to prevent disturbances. Major Cox also reported that in the middle of February the Nationalists were threatening to enter Bunder Abbas and take possession of the custom-house. For the moment, however, he said the movement was restrained by the fear of foreign inter- yention in the shape of foreign \var-ships, and the visit to Bunder Abbas &amp; on the h e 1 T a1 ^ Majesty s ship &lt;£ Perseus ” had for a few days a calming effect. Un the 17th March, however, it was reported to me that, as the result of the pressure from the Mujteheds of Nejef and the Seyyid of Laristan, the Nationalists at Bunder Abbas had assumed control of the Government and the customs, the Karguzar being installed as Governor by them. In telegraphing this information the Resident at ; usnne stated that he was asking the Senior Naval Officer to dispatch a war-ship to Bunder Abbas for the protection of British subjects. Major Cox also stated that he presumed tnat Ills Majesty’s Consul should recognize the defacto Governor, and that .mtis i impoiteis clearing merchandize from the custom-house should pay duty to those in a position to enforce it. I replied that His Majesty’s Consul should deal with the Karguzar without officially recognizing him as Governor ; that he should tell him that the Southern Customs were pledged to His Majesty’s Government and to ask thatthe Bunder Abbas receipts should be paid to the Consulate ; that I was informing the Persian Government that I should consider import duties paid to the Nationalists by British merchants as duly acquitted, and that 1 was claiming from the Nationalists the customs receipts on account ol the overdue interest on our loan secured on the Southern Customs. Major Cox further reported that the Belgian Customs Director had been offered the choice of entering the Nationalists service and paying the revenue to them, or leaving the Customs, and that he had preferred the latter alternative. Further information was to the effect that order was being effectually maintained, but that danger lay in the fact that everybody in the town was armed, and that armed bands from the interior continued to arrive. On the 23rd March His Majesty’s Consul at Bunder Abbas reported an interview with the Karguzar, who had inquired whether His Majesty’s Government wished that the whole of the customs duties should be handed over, and asked whether we should not be satisfied with the daily payment to the Consulate of half of the receipts. Captain Shakespear, in reporting this conversation, urged that it was desirable in the interests of tranquillity to leave the Nationalists a portion of the customs receipts for the payment of the men under arms, and I accordingly authorized him to use his discretion in the matter. The rapid march of events at Bunder Abbas appears to have brought affairs at Bushire to a head. On the 17th March the Besident reported that the populace there had hitherto hesitated to obey the dictates of the Nationalists, but that it seemed probable that the news from Bunder Abbas would prompt them to follow suit, ihe Governor of the town was absent, and it was scarcely to be expected that the garrison, consisting of 200 Persian soldiers from Ispahan, would offer serious support to the Customs Department or the local authorities against the Nationalist party. Major Cox added that he had discussed the situation with his Pussian colleague^and though for the moment there was no reason to apprehend deliberate molestation of foreigners, yet, in view of the possibility of general lawlessness, and the fact that the revenues of the Bushire customs were pledged to us, it might be prudent to have a war-ship within easy call for the protection of our interests. _ . On the 22 nd March it was reported to me that Seyyid Murteza Ahremi having introduced a number of Tangistani riflemen, had peacefully taken over control of the Government on behalf of the Nationalists, that the principal local officials were resigning, and that, though the Customs has so far not been interfered with, the question of taking them over was under consideration. Captain Trevor, who was in charge in the absence of Major Cox, added that he was informing the Seyyid that the customs receipts were pledged to His Majesty’s Government. I replied that I had no objection to the Nationalists taking over the Customs provided that a monthly instalment to cover the interest on our Government loan as well as the interest on the Imperial Bank of Persia’s advances was regularly paid into the Imperial Bank of Persia. On the 23rd March Captain Trevor reported that Seyyid Murteza had written officially to the Consulates announcing the assumption of the Government by himself cm behalf of the Nationalists, and stating that he was temporarily undertaking the duties of the local authorities and that he would arrange for the protection of the lives and property of foreigners. There had so far been no disorder, nor had the Customs been interfered with, but the Seyyid stated that he was referring to Tabreez on the subject. In order to prevent the local business of the Besidency coming to a standstill, Captain Trevor inquired whether he might treat officially^ with the de facto Governor ; I replied that he might deal with him without according him express recognition^ Latest information is to the effect that on the 23rd March the Seyyid took over the Customs, the Belgian officials withdrawing. Early the same day a meeting had been convened at the residence of theMirpenj, the commander of the local Government forces, and was attended by Seyyid Murteza, on behalf of the Nationalist party, the Karguzar, the postmaster, and other heads of the local departments, and by some half a, dozen respectable merchants. On being pressed as to whether he was for or against the Nationalists the Mirpenj tendered his resignation, the other Government officials following his example. The Seyyid, accompanied by his followers, then proceeded to the Governor’s house where the Boyal Standard was lowered and the National flag was hoisted in its place and a salute of twenty-one guns fired. This bloodless revolution is stated to be due to the fact that all classes in Bushire, including the Government officials, are Nationalists at heart. JL iiavG, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BABCLAY.Sir Gr. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received April 13.) Sir, Tehran, March 24, 1909. THE revolutionary movement in tlie provinces appears now to be spreading towards the north-eastern districts of Persia. On the 13th. February His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed reported that a strong reform movement was apparently being organized, but that the Governor- General, Rukn-ed-Dowleh, was keeping in touch with the reformers, and as these were timid and seemed to har^e no special objective, it was possible that the town might remain quiet. A week later Major Sykes reported that an abortive strike had taken place among the Meshed police, who had tried, but failed, to induce the soldiers to join them. Up to the end of February it appeared as if the appointment of Rukn-ed-Dowleh as Governor-General of Khorassan would be renewed at Nauroz, a course recommended to the Persian Government by the two Legations. It was reported that though attempts were being made to persuade the people not to pay revenue, and there was a general feeling that a demonstration of some kind must be made to show sympathy with the reform party, yet the people as a whole seemed not to be dissatisfied with their actual Governor. Early in March, however, it was reported that Rukn-ed-Dowleh had been dismissed, aud that the Shah had appointed in his place the Nayyir-ed- Dowleh who is personally unpopular in Khorassan, on the strength of a present of some 2,400/. which the latter had offered for the post. On the 4 th March Rukn-ed- Dowleh left Meshed, and on the 7th March Major Sykes reported that disturbances in Meshed had commenced. A bomb Avas exploded at the house belonging to a nepheAv of the new Governor- General. The revolutionaries seized the telegraph office, the shops in the city Avere closed, and the palace of the Governor-General was guarded by guns. The D'epidy- Governor Avas taken prisoner by the revolutionaries, and a neAv Assembly of the reform party was opened. His Majesty’s Consul-General reported that important develop ments were to be expected in view of the absence of all permanent responsible Government officials, including the late Karguzar, a person of good reputation and great local influence, but Avho had lately been recalled by the Persian Government. Meanwhile^ the disturbances had been spreading to Turbat-i-Haidari, and on the 16th March Major Sykes reported that the Acting Governor had been attacked and killed by a revolutionary party headed by Baluchis. He further reported that the Meshed Assembly had been much encouraged by this success, and by further successes reported to have^ been gained by the revolutionaries in other parts of Persia. 1 have received no further report from Meshed during the past week, but there seems to be no leason to suppose that the revolutionaries have any intention at present of returning to their allegiance to the Central Government.

THE Shah continues to reside in his armed camp at Bagh-i-Shah surrounded by his reactionary supporters, with the Sepahsalar (Amir Bahadur) at their head. Violent reactionary councils prevail, and the Shah, who was ten days ago reported to be much depressed, is now stated by those Europeans who see him daily to be cheerful, and to have received the news of the Nationalist successes at Turbat, Bunder Abbas, Bushire, Shiraz, and Hamadan with complete equanimity. The bazaars at Tehran remain closed, and the refugees are still at the Turkish Embassy. The political situation has caused much stagnation in financial and commercial affairs. The Imperial Bank’s operations have been greatly hampered by the difficulties and dangers of remitting caravans of coin to the provinces. Exchange which is offering at Tabreez, Resht, and Meshed cannot be bought, because money cannot be sent there for the purpose. The result is that high rates are maintained, to-day’s rate being 55f per pound. (Signed) G. P. CHURCHILL. March 26, 1909. Astrabad. On the 3rd February the Governor, Amir Mukarrem, barricaded the palace and placed 150 soldiers in the old fort. Next day the Nationalists closed their shops and assembled in a mosque, and their leaders decided that the Governor must leave the town. The Commander of the Hezar Jerib regiment, being a Nationalist, was ordered by the Governor to proceed with his regiment to Kafshekr. On leaving the town he gave the Nationalists twenty rifles, and sent in 200 men from neighbouring villages to help them. Early in March some of the local officials, although apparently not Nationalists, telegraphed to the Shah requesting the dismissal of the Governor. On the 7 th March the Prime Minister replied that the Governor had been recalled. The Nationalists, to show that the credit of getting the Governor dismissed belonged to them, and not to the local officials, closed the bazaars and assembled in large numbers in a mosque. Kerman, The Governor, Sahib Ekhtiar, has released the Naib and permitted the Nazim to return to Kerman. He also tendered his resignation, but the Persian Govern ment are unable to find a successor owing to the disturbed state of the country. His Majesty’s Consul anticipates trouble unless a strong Governor is appointed. On the 14th March His Majesty’s Consul telegraphed that the Governor of Baft had been defeated by the Afsharis, who had revolted. The Governor had been brought to Kerman seriously wounded, and the Afsharis had captured most of his camp and baggage, one gun, and the revenue which he had collected, |o04] • G 386 Kermanshah. Captain Haworth, telegraphing on the 24th February from Hamadan, reported that a small number of leading Nationalists at that place had taken refuge with the Turkish Consular Agent, and had sent telegrams to the Turkish Embassy at Tehran and to the Forte regarding the present state of affairs in Persia. The Nationalists believed that they could raise 2,000 horsemen, with the help of the Khodahendulu tribes to assist them, but Captain Haworth thinks that this is an exaggeration, and that they are not likely to declare openly for the Constitution until they are certain of raising enough horsemen to withstand the regiments and local Chiefs who are on the side of the Shah ; 2 , 000 /. was said to have been collected for the payment of the Nationalist forces. The Acting Governor informed Captain Haworth that he had repeatedly resigned, but the Shah only replied with orders to suppress all Consti tutional movements. The Acting: Governor said that if he carried out these orders the people would kill him, and if he disobeyed them the Shah would kdl him. He asked if he could take refuge with the British Representative, to which Captain Haworth replied that we give sanctuary only when the life of a man is in danger. Yezd. It appears that the party of 200 raiders, mentioned in last month’s summary as being Bakhtiaris, was in reality composed of inhabitants of Feragheh, a notorious robber village between Abaded and Abargough, who had been joined by a number ofTaftis. Samsam-es-Sultaneh disclaimed any connection with them. The party, led by one Khosrou Khan, approached to vithin a short distance of Yezd. This caused consternation in the town, and the Governor sent out a force, which retreated after a skirmish with the raiders. Khosrou Khan announced that he had come to restore Constitutional government, but met with no response from the people of Yezd, who believed that he and the Taftis only wished to loot the town. Failing to get a telegram sent to Samsam-es-Sultaneh, or to get support from the Yezdis, the party withdrew, and its subsequent movements are not known. With reference to the ill-treatment of Parsees in the neighbourhood of Yezd, it appears that the culprits were Taftis, who raided a Parsee village and carried off three men, who were subsequently ransomed by their friends. His Majesty’s Acting Vice-Consul made representations to the Governor, and by the end of February the latter had assembled a force of about 1,000 men to be sent against Taft. Meanwhile the Taftis, who appear to have influential friends in Yezd, were trying to patch up a truce, and no force has yet gone against them. A number of robber bands still frequent the roads, and robberies are of frequent occurrence. The Kerman road is perhaps the least safe. On the 20 th February a telegram was received at Nain from Agha Norullah, of Ispahan, calling upon all those who were ready to take up arms in the righteous cause to come to Ispahan. Entezam-ul-Mulk, formerly Governor of Yezd, was also reported to be collecting troops at Amirabad. He has since joined the Bakhtiaris at Ispahan. Shiraz. Ibe centre of gravity of Fars politics is still in Laristan. The Kawamis seem to be pressed for money. On the 14th February the Kawam’s agent in Tehran tele graphed that unless they could accomplish something it would be all up with them. Nasr-ed-Dowleh, who returned unexpectedly in the middle of February from Laristan, told Mr. Bill that the Kawamis forces had defeated the Laris, but Mr. Bill believes that this was a fabrication, and that it is unlikely that the Kawamis will be able to make head against the Laris. Nasr-ed-Dowleh insisted that the Lari Seyyed was playing for his own hand, and would pay no more attention to the orders of a constitutional Government than to those of the Shah. Meanwhile, the Bakhtiaris have telegraphed in the strongest terms to the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh reproaching him for his inaction “ after all that he had promised,” and, on the other hand, it seems certain that the Kawamis are trying with some success to come to an arrangement with Samsam- es-Sultaneh, in which case Sowlet-ed-Dowleh may find he has overstayed his market. The latest news is that the Kawam returned to Shiraz on the 7 th March leaving his troops at Fassa. In Shiraz itself early in March there was a mild agitation in favour of theconstitution under clerical leadership. It seems that the Governor-Genera], so far from suppressing the two meetings held, sent them messages of sympathy. On the 21 st February a serious assault was committed on two Parsees who were seriously stabbed by a drunken servant of the Governor-General’s. Mr. Bill sent the Consulate Munshi with a private letter to the Governor protesting against the incident as seriously endangering the public peace. The offender was arrested, but a large crowd besieged the house of the Parsee employer of the wounded men and intimidated him into proceeding in person to the palace and giving his sanction to the immediate release of the offender. On the 11 th March a caravan accompanied by pilgrims was attacked near Yezdikhast. One pilgrim was shot dead and four others were mortally wounded. I hirteen loaded mules were taken away. One of the cases looted contained thirty magazine rifles. On the 20 th March Plis Majesty’s Consul telegraphed that the agent of Messrs. Ziegler had been stripped and robbed near Sivend by robbers, who were believed to be Lashanis. The Governor-General dispatched thirty men to try to capture the robbers. Mr. Bill also reported that 200 telegraph insulators had been broken during the week by tribesmen near Zergoon, and that several robberies had occurred on the road south of Abadeh. Persian Gulf. • Bushire. « It is reported that the Darya Beggi has been reappointed Governor of the Gulf ports. Mohammerafi. Early in February it was rumoured from Ram Hormuz that the other Bakhtiari Khans had offered to make peace with Samsam-es-Suhaneh and restore the previous arrangements recognizing him as Ilkhani, presumably on account of his recent success at Ispahan.

Les details manquent, mais on clit que les coupables sont dans 1’emploi du Vice-Gouverneur de Teheran. II est evident que pour eviter d’autres crimes de cette nature il est indispensable qu’une enquete soit tenue et que les coupables soient punis, et les deux Legations ont Thonneur de faire observer a votre Excellence que dans le cas ou il serait aver 6 que ceux-ci ont agi sous les ordres du Vice-Gouverneur, il serait au plus haut degre desirable que Mufakher-ul-Mulk soit destitue sans retard. Cette mesure serait, votre Excellence le reconnaitra, la meilleure pour eviter que les crimes d’hier soir n’amenent [504] G 4des troubles plus dtendus qui pourraient leser les intents des nationaux des deux Legations et qui pourraient exposer le Gouvernement du Chah k une lourde responsabilite que les Legations voudraient lui epargner. Je profite, &amp;c. (Translation.) Your Excellency, March 24, 1909. THE British and Russian legations have learnt with regret that some of the “ bastis” at Shah Abdul Azim were assassinated last night. Details are lacking, but it is said that the guilty persons are in the employ of the vice-governor of Tehran. It is clearly essential that, in order to prevent further crimes of this nature, an enquiry should be held and the guilty punished, and the two legations have the honour to point out to your Excellency that, in the event of it being ptoved that the guilty persons were acting under the orders of the vice-governor, it would be highly desirable that Mufakher-ul-Mulk should be dismissed without delay. Such a step would, your Excellency will admit, be the best means to prevent the crimes of last night leading to more widespread disturbances, which might be prejudicial to the interests of subjects of the two legations, and which might impose upon the Shah’s Government heavy respon sibilities, which the legations desire to spare them. I avail, &amp;c. • Inclosure 2 in No. 175. Joint Note communicated to Saad-ed-Dowleh. LES deux Legations, se referant a leur note collective du 24 courant, croient de leur devoir de faire savoir au Gouvernement persan que le bruit rendant responsable Mufakher-ul-Mulk des meurtres a Chah Abdul Azim est tellement gdndral qu’ils croient de leur devoir, pour apaiser Tagitation actuelle dans la capitale, de demander le renvoi de ce fonctionnaire. En faisant cette demarche les deux Legations sont convaincues qu’elles agissent dans les meilleurs inteiAts du Chah et de son Gouvernement, qui seront tenus entiere- ment responsables par les Gouvernements britannique et russe pour cequipourra arriver a leurs nationaux par suite des troubles que les deux Legations craignent dans le cas ou leurs demandes ne seraient pas executees. Les deux Legations prient votre Excellence de soumettre ce qui precede a Sa Majeste. Le 26 mars, 1909. (Translation.) REFERRING to their joint note of the 24th instant, the two legations beg to point out to the Persian Government that the rumour making Mufakher-ul-Mulk responsible for the murders at Shah Abdul Azim is so general that they consider it their duty to demand the dismissal of that official in order to calm the existing agitation in the capital. In putting forward this demand the two legations are convinced that they are acting in the best interests of the Shah and of his Government, who will be held completely responsible by the British and Russian Governments for whatever may befall their subjects as a result of the disturbances which the two legations apprehend in the event of their demand not being complied with. The two legations request your Excellency to submit the above to His Majesty. March 26, 1909. No. 176, Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 13.) St, St. Petersburgh, April 2, 1909. M.

Ces dates devront etre portees sans retard a la connaissance du pays entier. 6 . Le Gouvernement russe pourra, s’il le juge necessaire, avancer au Gouverne- ment persan aussitot que les mesures preparatoires enumerees aux §§ 1 a 5 du programme auront ete prises par le Schah, une somme de 2,500,000 fr., destinee a subvenir aux depenses immediates necessitees par fintroduction des reformes. De son cote, le Gouvernement britannique, s’ii le # juge necessaire, pourra faire au Gouverne ment du Schah une avance du m 6 me montant aussitot que I’assemblee elective aura adopte le projet d’un emprunt exterieur plus ou moins considerable.

Le Gouvernement Imperial estime que la mise a execution du programme expose pi-dessus represente pour la Perse le seul moyen de sortir de la situation presque inextricable ou elle se trouve actuellement et cpie, si le Schah n’accepte pas ce pro gramme dans tons ses details, la Russie et 1’Angleterre n’auront plus qu’a discontinuer leurs conseils^ et abandonner Mohammed Ali a ses propres ressources, apres quoi il n aurait plus a compter sur aucun soutien de leur part. En consequence, le Gouverne ment russe trouve desirable qu’en soumettant le programme en question au Schah, les representants russe et britannique lui fassent une declaration categorique dans ^ Aussitot que I’Ambassade britannique aura informe le Ministere Imperial des Affaires Etrangeres de ce que le Cabinet de Londres n’a pas d’objections au texte du programme contenu dans le present aide-memoire, ce programme sera immediatement communique par telegraphe au Charge d’Affaires de Russie a Teheran afin qu’il fasse aupres du Schah, conjointement avec le Ministre anglais, la demarche prescrite. Saint-Petersbourg, le 26 mars (8 avril), 1909. (Translation.) THE .final text of the programme of advice to be given to His Majesty the Shah by the Russian and British Governments would be as follows :— 1 . The Governments of Russia and Great Britain will demand of the Shah the instant dismissal of the Sadr-Azam, as well as of the Amir Bahadur Jang. The dismissal of the latter will include dismissal from all posts occupied by him, both in the Cabinet and at the palace. If the Shah, however, offers a stubborn opposition to this official being dismissed from the palace, the two Governments will not insist upon this latter point. 2 . Russia and England will obtain from the Shah the re-establishment of the constitutional regime in Persia by means of the immediate introduction of the reforms enumerated in the following paragraphs. 3. I he two Governments will demand of the Shah the constitution of a Cabinet composed of persons worthy of confidence, and the addition without delay to the Council of the Empire of enlightened persons belonging to different parties; the Council to be empowered to elaborate and promulgate a new electoral law. The Russian and British legations at Tehran will submit privately to the Shah a list of candidates most suitable to form the Cabinet and the Council of the Empire ; it is understood that if the Shahs choice falls upon persons who do not inspire the necessary confidence no money advance will be made to Persia. 4. 1 he two Governments will demand of the Shah a general amnesty for all those who have taken up arms against him and have been guilty of political offences. This measure will naturally not be extended to those revolutionaries who have also committed offences ag’ainst the common law. As regards persons convicted of brigandage and other criminals who may have taken advantage of the constitutional movement to cc it offences against the common law, the Shah’s Government will be desired to give guarantees that no punishment will be inflicted upon them except as a result of the judgment of an impartial tribunal, as was done at the time in the case of persons who had taken bast in the British legation at Tehran. 5. Russia and Great Britain will further demand that a date may be immediately fixed for the parliamentary elections, as well as for the convocation of the Medjliss. These dates to be made known without delay to the whole country.6 . As soon as the measures enumerated in paragraphs 1 to 5 have been taken by the Shah, the Russian Government may, if they think necessary, make an advance of 2,500,000 fr. to the Persian Government for the urgent expenses necessitated by the introduction of reforms. The British Government, on their side, will, if they considei it necessary, make an advance of a similar amount to the Government of the Shah as soon as the elective assembly shall have adopted the project of an external loan moie oi less considerable in amount. In the event of such a decision by the Medjliss, the two Powers will lend Persia their assistance with a view to concluding this loan. The Imperial Government is of opinion that the execution of the programme outlined above represents for Persia the sole means by which she can escape fiom the almost inextricable situation in which she hnds herself at present, and that if the Shah does not accept this programme in all its details, the only course left to Russia and Great Britain will be to discontinue their advice and to leave Mohammed Ah to his own resources, after which His Majesty would no longer be ^ able^ to count upon any support from them. The Russian Government therefore think it desiiable that, m submitting the programme in question to the Shah, the Russian and British repiesen- tatives should make a categorical declaration in this sense. _ .. As soon as the British embassy informs the Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the Cabinet of London has no objections to offer to the text oh the programme contained in the present memorandum, this programme will be communicated immediately by telegraph to the Russian charge d’affaires at Tehran, in order that he may, in conjunction with the British Minister, make the communication agreed upon to the Shah.

CUSTOMS receipts at Bushire. . . . , I have received the following telegram of the 12th instant from His Majesty s Consul-General at Bushire :—- “On the 8 th April Seyyid Murteza forced the merchants, in whose names the receipts had been deposited, to withdraw and pay over to him the balance. Thus the entire income since the 23rd March, amounting to some 20,000 tomans, has been seized bv the Seyyid and his followers. “ Fifty of the men landed yesterday were located at the customs wharf, which affords ample accommodation for them- It is also the most convenient place, owing to the state of the weather and to the fact that from there it will be easy to prevent the ingress of further bodies of riflemen expected from across the harboui, &amp; “If, pending the final regulation of this question, the Seyyid attempts to seize more of the receipts, I presume that I may use the men who are already installed here to prevent this.” In reply, I have sent the following telegram :— “ There is no objection to the proposal contained in the last paragraph of your telegram. ' “ Please tell Seyyid Murteza and other Nationalists that unless some arrangement satisfactorily securing our rights is made we shall be compelled to contemplate the possibility of seizing the customs, though we are most anxious to avoid doing so. “ The customs receipts had best be retained by the Belgian officials in the custom house until we can come to some satisfactory arrangement with the leaders of a responsible Nationalist party.”92 No. 179.

Nothing, however, can be done except to hasten the departure of the newly-appointed Governor. J rr .

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 14.) (Telegraphic.) BUSHIRE. I have received the following telegram of the 14th Consul-General at Bush ire : — Tehran, April 14, 1909. April from His Majesty’s Murteza still persists in keeping 200 to 300 riflemen with him ; the town is panic-stricken, and matters are at a deadlock. A raid by these men is anticipated • the bazaars consequently and even shops are still closed. Unless some relief comes General 6 ln ia ^ ltants tlireat en to take “ bast ” en masse at His Majesty’s Consulate- &gt; “ The whole community now realize that the Seyyid’s mask of Nationalism is merely designed to cover_ his rapacious intentions. Three prominent Chiefs of Dashti and angistan have written to me signifying their intention to adhere to my wishes. _ “ the chief Nationalists and Royalists among the Persian population laid before me then’ views on the situation. They consider, without exception, that Seyyid must leave Bush ire and suggest his removal to Nejef, where the Ulema already have know ledge of his character they are all equally convinced of the impossibility of restoring order if he is allowed to remain. Can you, in these circumstances, authorize me to uin iim out, the Nationalists not being sufficiently strong to do so without our help ? it is urgently required that action should be immediate.” ' In reply I have sent the following telegram to Major Cox ‘/You have already been authorized to employ bluejackets for the expulsion of the langistams if their presence should constitute a real danger for the lives of foreigners. Un ess Seyyid s presence constitutes such a danger, I cannot sanction your proposal without the authorization of His Majesty’s Government.”Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, April 14, 1909. THE action reported by you in your telegram of the 12 th April has my approval] The Persian Government have undertaken by Treaty to respect and efficiently to protect ” the subjects and citizens of foreign Powers. You should, therefore, when the necessity arises, insist on their either allowing the foreigners in Tabreez to leave the town or allowing sufficient supplies of food to enter it. No. 183. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, April 14, 1909. THE expulsion of Seyyid from Bushire, suggested by His Majesty’s Consul- General in his telegram repeated to me in your telegram of the 14th April, and which it appears that the Nationalists have joined with the Boyalists in requesting, would go beyond the object for which troops have been landed, i.e., the protection of the lives and property of British subjects and residents of other nationalities. Moreover, if we were to expel Seyyid, the decision as to who should be intrusted with the government of Bushire would rest with us. His expulsion would, ipso facto, constitute us the government of the town, and it is difficult to see when this state of affairs would come to an end as there would be no other satisfactory authority which could take his place. There is, however, no reason why Seyyid should not be warned that if British subjects or foreigners are attacked, they will be protected against him by force if need be. No. 184. Sir G.

Proposals mentioned by His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabreez are accepted by Russian Government, who have instructed their Consular Representative at Tabreez to act in concert with Mr. Wratislaw. Hie Russian Government believe, from the information which has reached them, that the Nationalist demands are that a Constitution and a full amnesty should be granted, and that permission should be given to those whose arms are their own personal property to retain them, while the arms belonging to the Persian Government would be surrendered ; finally, a diplomatic guarantee is required that the old regime will not be re-established. ^ In the opinion of the Russian Government the advice to be tendered by the two Governments to the Shah in great measure meets the requirements of the Nationalists. With regard to the proposed diplomatic guarantee, the Russian Government suggest that perhaps it^ might be pointed out to the Nationalist leaders that the old regime would be definitely terminated by the introduction of the reforms which the two Governments are urging the Shah to adopt.

He thinks that it would not be safe to urge the Shah in this sense, as he might provide facilities for their quitting the town and then decline any further responsibility. He also reports that British subjects can, with a little difficulty, last out for some time longer. I concur in Mr. AYratislaw s view \ and, beyond the action reported in my telegram of the 12 th instant, I do not for the moment contemplate any further move as regards a safe conduct.

I have received the Tehran, April 16, 1909. following telegram from His Majesty’s Consul-General We are still waiting for the result of the negotiations at Basminch. Those of the Nationalist party who are in control of the town will not move from their original demands, which are understood to be— (a.) Restoration of the Constitution. “ (b.) Universal and complete amnesty.95 “ ( c .) Removal of all—most particularly irregular—Government troops, “ (cl.) Retention of all arms which are not Government property. “ (y.j Appointment of a Governor-General acceptable to Tahreez. (the three following; names are mentioned in this connection : Saad-ed-Dowleh, Mukhber-es- Sultaneh, and Imamkuh Mirza.) “ ( f .) r rhese terms must be guaranteed by foreign Powers. “ The general population, on the other hand, desire nothing but to see an end to the present distressing situation. To accomplish this the two Governments might, if they thought fit, press upon the Shah to accept these conditions, or such modified forms of them as the Nationalists might be forced by straitened circumstances to accept. “ The town is at present cpiiet, but lack of food is severely felt. “ Part 2 .—A foreign guarantee of constitutional government in a modified form should bring about an earlier solution of the question. My Russian colleague and I, however, think that, should a capitulation be forced on the town, the following arrange ments are urgent :— “ (a.) The tribesmen under Rahim and Samad Khan should be removed to a distance of at least 20 miles, and under no circumstances allowed to enter the town. “ (A) Any persons who may be excluded from the amnesty should, under the usual implied conditions, he allowed to take ‘ bast ’ at the Consulates. “ (c.) The parties may arrange the surrender of arms and munitions between themselves. “ (d.) The hulk of Ain-ed-Dowleh’s force should be instructed to maintain its present positions, while only the Persian Cossacks should be allowed to enter the town, with Ain-ed-Dowleh, to maintain order. ct (&lt;?.) Ain-ed-Dowleh should be instructed to see to the maintenance of order in the town, and to conform to our joint representations in everything connected with or arising from the capitulation. “ We do not think it advisable to offer any uncalled-for help in the above sense, hut, should the peace negotiations fail (as is not unlikely) and no help come from outside, the Nationalists will be forced to consider the prospect of a surrender on less favourable terms. Then they would presumably apply to us, and the moment, we think, would be a good one to put forward our proposals. “ Great caution will be necessary in the granting of guarantees. Part 3 .—The actual conditions of the moment have inspired these conclusions’ but some unexpected success of the Nationalist arms in another part of Persia, internal strife, or treason may completely change the face of things and consequently the tenour of our decision.” As regards first part, two most essential points are sufficiently covered by our own general representations. If latter succeed, points (c), (d), and (e) should be obtained. As regards (/), more cannot be given, and may not be necessary, than the knowledge that the Shah’s concessions are due to our representations. As regards second part, which should only become necessary if our representations fail, Consuls should, if the case arises, endeavour to obtain terms indicated, and we should support them here.

I have received the following telegram, of the 17th April, from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabreez :— “ I believe that public food supply is much smaller than I was at first given to understand. There seems, however, to be a fair quantity for the soldiers. The amounts are apparently unascertainable. The situation is very critical, and Members of the Assembly have hinted that Europeans would bear the brunt of the riot that is probably threatening. c&lt; This afternoon my Kussian colleague and I were invited to visit the Assembly. They declared that a serious riot was probable unless something to relieve the situation were immediately done, the food supply (except for soldiers) being very small. Ihey begged us to convey a request to the two Legations to urge the Shah to accept the following proposals :— “ 1 . That a supply of 150 kharvars of wheat for the poor, which they guarantee would not be used for combatants, should be sent in by the Basminch road, which should be opened for this purpose. “ 2 . The opening of the road to be followed by a suspension of hostilities. ^ “ 3 . That they should enter into communication with the Shah, and with other towns in Persia, with a view to arranging a general settlement through delegates chosen by them. “ The Assembly beg the two Legations to support them in these^ claims, and to impress on the Shah that the people of Azerbaijan are not fighting against him, but have taken up arms with the sole object of defending fundamental laws and the Constitution. “ The military leaders were to have been present on this occasion, but did not $t My Russian colleague and I pointed out to them that the acceptance ot their terms was very improbable, but promised to comply with their request. “ An identic communication was addressed by the local Assembly to Consuls this morning begging them to take measures for the welfare of natives and foreigners alike. This communication stated that until now food had been ^supplied to foreigners as well as townspeople, but that henceforward it would be scarce.” I am replying to His Majesty’s Consul-General instructing him to inform the Nationalists that any injury to foreigners at their hands may do irreparable damage to their cause. , i xi It appears to me quite useless to attempt to press the terms suggested by the Assembly on the Shah, No. 19C.

The Russian Government are considering the advisability of threatening the Shah that, unless certain quantities of food are admitted into Tabreez, they will themselves take steps to introduce the same, and will, it necessary, employ force to effect that object. Ibis could be done, M. Isvolsky says, by dispatching an expedition from Julfa, and he says that he will consult his colleagues in the Cabinet on the subject. He explains that foreigners in Tabreez cannot be allowed to die of starvation. M. Isvolsky informed me that Caucasians from Resht were threatening Astara and the life ol the Russian Consul there. As Astara is situated close to the Russian frontier, troops will probably be moved in for the protection of the Russian Consul. The programme is being telegraphed this evening to M. Sabline. No. 200.

Eussian Charge d’Affaires at Tehran was instructed yesterday to inform the Shah immediately that, unless urgent orders were sent to Tabreez to admit daily 150 kharvars of wheat, steps would be taken by the Eussian Government themselves to cause the introduction of the supplies of food required. The Eussian Consul at Tabreez was, moreover, instructed to let the population of Tabreez know that this communication had been made to the Shah. In reply to my inquiry to-day as to whether a small Cossack force would not be sent by the Eussian Government to bring away the Consuls and any other foreign subjects who might wish to leave the city, M. Isvolsky replied that it would be risky to send a small^ force, and that a considerable body of troops would be necessary. The number required would have to be decided by the authorities on the spot. By a forced march Cossacks might reach Tabreez from Julfa in two days ; three days would be required in the case of other troops. Would it not be better, M. Isvolsky suggested, to postpone action for another twenty-four hours, until the results of M. Sablines action at Tehran and of the Eussian Consul’s announcement at Tabreez were known? If an attack were made on the Consulates to-day, as threatened, then the troops could not arrive in time, and, on the other hand, it was possible that the Shah might act in accordance with the suggestion conveyed to him by M.

If the population of Tabreez are driven to desperation by the violation on the part of the Shah’s troops of the conditions promised through our Representatives to the Tabreez Nationalists, our subjects and Consulates may become the objects of retaliation on their part. It is essential that this danger should be guarded against by the Russian Government. It appears, however, to be desirable that an authoritative statement should be issued to the effect that any intervention which may be undertaken in any part of Persia by either of the two Powers is of an entirely temporary character, and will not extend beyond objects of the nature of those now aimed at at Tabreez and which have rendered our action at Bushire necessary as well as Russian precautions in other localities.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the translation of a communique, published in this morning’s “ Official Messenger,” relative to the state of affairs in Tabreez, and to the instructions which have been issued to the Viceroy of the Caucasus to hold himself in readiness to dispatch a column of Bussian troops to that town. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. NICOLSON. Inclosure in No. 246. Extract from the “ Official Messenger” of April 21, 1909. (Translation.) ACCORDING to information received by the St. Petersburgh Telegraphic Agency from the Director of the Consulate-General at Tabreez, the populace of that town, driven to desperation by starvation, with the “ fidais ” at their head, intend to plunder’ in their search for bread, the Armenian quarters and the Bussian and British Consulates situated therein. The heads of the movement calculate apparently that by this means, and, in an extreme case, by the murder of one of the Consuls, Russian intervention will be evoked, which will delay the surrender of Tabreez to the troops of the Shah and make it possible for the revolutionaries to conceal themselves. In view of such a state of affairs the Bussian Government instructed their Repre sentative in Tehran to categorically demand of the Shah orders for the immediate admission into Tabreez of a sufficient quantity of provisions for the needs of the foreign Consulates, establishments, and subjects, and also of the peaceable population of the town. Furthermore, the Charge d’Affaires has been instructed to inform the Persian Government that failure to carry out this demand forthwith will compel Russia to take immediate decisive measures for the opening, by armed force, of the road to Tabreez for the carriage thither of provisions and in the defence of Russian and foreign establish ments and subjects in that town. Twenty-four hours ago fresh and extremely alarming information as to the state of affairs in that town was received from the Director of the Consulate-General at Tabreez, amongst other, news of the decision arrived at by the starving populace and “ fidais ” to attack the Russian and English Consulates m the immediate future. Similar informa tion has been received also by the British Government, who on their part have notified to the Imperial Government the desirability of dispatching a detachment to Tabreez to enable foreigners so wishing to leave the town. In view of the aforegoing and with the permission of the Emperor, the Viceroy of the Caucasus was instructed to dispatch immediately a column of sufficient strength for the defence of Russian and foreign institutions and subjects in the town, for arranging for the transport of supplies for them, and also for the maintenance and guarantee of communications between Tabreez and Julfa. view of information vdiich has been received that tranquillity now prevails in Tabreez owing to orders of the Shah for the cessation of hostilities for six days and for the admission of provisions into the besieged town, the Viceroy of the Caucasus has been ordered to delay until receipt of further instructions the dispatch across the frontier of the column destined for Tabreez, but not to cease, however, taking preparatory measures in the event of further complications. No. 247. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey .—{Received April 26.) ^ r ’ M Petersburgh, April 23, 1909. mi a •’ ii me y esterda .y hi s news from Tabreez was not satisfactory. 1 le Am-ed-Dowleh stated that he had received no orders to grant an armistice, though, a ter some discussion, he agreed to permit one road to be opened for the passage of provisions. He asserted that the telegraph line from Basminch to Tehran had not beenIll in working order, winch probably accounted for the fact of his having received no instructions from Tehran as to according an armistice. M. Isvolsky was of opinion that little reliance could be placed on the word of the Ain-ed-Dowleh, and that probably difficulties would arise as to the safe passage of provisions. Moreover, the Shah had informed the two Representatives that he would reflect over the proposals which had been made to him in regard to the promulgation of a Constitution, &amp;c. The situation at Tabreez would probably become dangerous again at any moment, and he was about to consult with the Minister of Finance and of War and with the Chief of the General Staff as to whether, in the circumstances, it would not be prudent to order the Russian detachment to advance to Tabreez. This step would secure the free passage of provisions and might also exercise an influence over the Shah to expedite his giving a favourable reply to the representations of the two Governments. Late last night I received a letter from M. Isvolsky stating that the telegraph line from Basminch to Tehran has not been interrupted, and that the Russian Consul telegraphs that the situation is more threatening than ever. In these circumstances the Russian Government consider that they can hesitate no longer ; and orders have been sent to move on the detachment at Julfa. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. NICOLSON. No. 248.

Veuillez porter ce qui precede a la connaissance du Gouvernement britannique, (Translation.) (Telegraphic.) ££. Petersburgh, April 10 (23), 1909. FROM recent reports received from the Russian consul-general at Tabreez, the famine which has broken out there places the Russian and other foreign consulates and subjects in serious danger. The Russian charge d’affaires at Tehran has therefore been instructed to declare to the Shah that unless measures are immediately taken to provide the foreign consulates and subjects, as well as the non-combatant population of the town, with the necessary provisions, a detachment of troops will be sent from Julfa in order to protect the foreign consulates and subjects at Tabreez, and to ensure the importation of adequate provisions into the town. In spite of the Shah’s promise to give the necessary orders to Prince Ain-ed- Dowleh, the Persian commander has not authorised the supplies to be sent info thetown, and the situation of the consulates and foreign subjects remains, as heretofore, critical. The Imperial Government has therefore been compelled to have recourse to those measures which have been made known to the Shah, and the Russian detachment is now leaving Julfa on its way to Tabreez. The objects of this expedition are restricted to what has been mentioned above. The Imperial troops will only remain in Persian territory as long as may be necessary in order to guarantee completely the security of the lives and property of the Russian and foreign consulates and their subjects. Please bring the above to the knowledge of the British Government. No. 249. Sir G, Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received April 26.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, April 26, 1909. TABREEZ. With reference to my immediately preceding telegram, I have received the following telegram from His Majesty’s Consul-General dated yesterday “ The local assembly have sent a deputation to us with a copy of a telegram sent by the Shah for transmission to Ain-ed-Dowleh and to each general personally. They are ordered in this to open all roads, to do everything in their power to facilitate entry of provisions, to keep their present positions, and entirely to suspend hostilities pending further orders. They have begged us that, until it is seen whether the Shah’s orders will be obeyed, the Russian troops may not advance. “We think it best that the Russian troops should not be stopped until they are within reach of Tabreez, but that we might be authorised to say that they will only enter the town under circumstances of exceptional necessity. “ In this way the safety of foreign subjects is most likely to be assured and a reconciliation made possible between the Shah and his people on the lines of your representations.” The two consuls are probably right in advocating the dispatch of Russian troops in the interests of foreigners’ safety; moreover, the dispatch of Russian troops will undoubtedly incline the Shah to listen more favourably to our advice. We will, should the two Governments concur, authorise our consuls-general to make the declaration suggested, and might at the same time address to the Persian Government a joint note in the same sense. I think that it is desirable that in order to demonstrate the complete harmony of the two Governments I should associate myself with my Russian colleague in making this announcement. No. 250. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received April 26.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, April 26, 1909. TABREEZ. I have received the following telegram of the 25th April from His Majesty’s consul-general:— “ As the same situation could easily recur in a few days and for the reason put forward in my immediately preceding telegram, I venture to suggest that it would be unwise to stop the troops. “ The intense joy resulting from the Shah’s concessions, which the Minister for Foreign Affairs mentions, is rather exaggerated; it will not in any case become evident until some result ensues, and this is still considered doubtful by the population. The people change their attitude hourly. I cannot follow their ideas or tell what their real wishes are.”113 No. 251. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, April 26, 1909. HIS Majesty’s Consul-General may be authorized to make the proposed declara tion in concert with the Russian Acting Consul-General (see your telegrams of the 26th instant) if the Russian Government have sent similar instructions to their Charge d’Alfaires. You may join with Russian Charge d’Affaires in addressing note in the same sense to the Persian Government. No. 252. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edivard Grey ,— (Receiied April 27.) Sir, St. Pelersburgh, April 21, 1909. THE intelligence which reached M. Isvolsky from Tabreez in regard to the increased tension of the situation there decided the Russian Government to lose no time in ordering the immediate advance of the column which had been held in readiness at Julfa. It was clear that grave risks would be incurred if further delay Avere permitted, and, unwilling as the Russian Government are to proceed to active measures, the position of affairs left them no alternative but to take steps for insuring the safety of the European colony at Tabreez. The column consists of three battalions of infantry, four sotnias of Cossacks, two batteries, and a company of sappers. The battalions arc on a peace footing. The Russian Consul at Tabreez considered that a force of 200 Cossacks to guard a convoy of provisions might be sufficient, but the Russian authorities were of opinion, and I venture to think rightly, that the column should be of sufficient strength to be able to overcome any resistance if such were offered. Moreover, it will be necessary to leave posts at certain intervals to keep the road open, so that the number of men does not seem to be greater than reason would require. M. Isvolsky informed me that the column would take with them as many provisions as was possible, though, of course, it was impossible for it to collect and transport supplies sufficient to feed the whole population of Tabreez. Nevertheless, once that the road is opened up, probably supplies wdll flow in. The orders given to the Officer Commanding the column are to abstain from any interference in the differences between the two contending parties at Tabreez, and in no wise to assume any administrative duties. He is to give the necessary protection to the foreign Consulates and institutions, and to all foreigners residing in the town. When the situation has returned to a normal condition, and there is no longer any fear of danger to the foreign residents, the troops will be withdrawn. An official communique has been published here explaining the reasons for the departure of a force, and a Circular telegram has been sent to the Powers to the same effect. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A.

In order to provide guards for banks and for other institutions, and for any Consulate which may wish to have one, some small detachments will be sent into the town. M. Isvolsky hardly thinks it necessary to address a joint note to the Persian Government to inform them of this, but he sees no objection to the twm Consuls letting it be known to whatever persons „ and in whatever way they may consider desirable.

The two consuls-general hear that a good effect has been produced by their explanation of the motives and temporary character of the Russian action. Ihe Shah has granted an amnesty, and made a vague promise of a constitution consistent with Mussulman law, the Nationalist party using the approach of the Russian troops as a means of extorting concessions from him. My Russian colleague and I have heard that the Shah proposes to publish a totally inadequate pioject in place of the required electoral law.

Samsam is daily awaiting the arrival of Sardar Assad, who is reported to be accom panied by some 2,000 Bakhtiaris, and a move on Tehran is, it is said, projected for the 21st April. The Chiefs are now said to be united, and it appears very unlikely that any stand will be made hy the Shah’s troops at Kashan, who number some 1,500 men, including 300 Bakhtiaris, who will probably join their fellow clansmen at the first oppoitumty. The few supporting troops at Kum are in a semi-mutinous state, and some days ago a number of them took bast at the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s office as a protest against the non-receipt of their pay, which they stated was two years m arrear. In these circumstances it is scarcely to be expected that the troops coverirm the road to Tehran will make any effective resistance should the Bakhtiari advance take place. Meanwhile, at Ispahan order appears to be effectively maintained, though Samsam seems to be somewhat disgusted with the attitude of the mollahs, headed by Agha iN ejeh, and to be far from successful in raising money by voluntary means for the payment of his men An attempt was recently made by the Sadr Azam, through a certain Saham-es-Sultaneh, to patch up matters between the Shah and the Bakhtiaris and a compromise was proposed by which the Governorship of Ispahan was to be conferred on Samsam, who, however, indignantly refused to listen to this clumsy effort at reconciliation. J Mr. Consul-General Grahame has, so far, been successful in inducing Samsam to respect the lines of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, which the Chief had complained were being used against him. He appears to have been mollified by the promise ! instructed Mr. Grahame to make, to the effect that after the 1st April the receipts for local traffic should be made over to him. By virtue of this arrangement a certain small sum (1,231 krans) was handed over to Samsam at the beginning of Aprilon account of tlio local traffic during tlio previous monthj and the Departments wires are now working without interruption. The Ispahan-Shiraz road is in a state of deplorable insecurity. Some four weeks ao-o the agent of Messrs. Ziegler was robbed at Yezdikhast, four stages north ot Shiraz, by men belonging to the Lashani tribe. A member of the Church Missionary Society, and the post between Dehbid and Sivend have also been robbed, while two gbolams of the Indo-European Telegraph Department on the same stage ^ have been held up by Arab tribesmen who beat and stripped them. On. the 8th April His Majesty’s Consul-General at Ispahan was informed by Samsam that the tribesmen were on the war path, and that no British subjects should travel on any roads in the Ispahan district for some days to come. _ . . Samsam added that he was ordering his people to take precautions against possible raiders Mr. Grahame has accordingly warned British subjects against travelling in the Ispahan neighbourhood until further notice. I have also directed His Majesty s Acting Consul at Shiraz to issue a similar notice, and a further warning has been Mso circulated among the British subjects in Tehran, ^ T hn cvo (Signed) ’ G.’ BARCLAY. No. 281, Sir G, Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received May 10.) gir Tehran, April 19, 1909. HOSTILITIES of minor importance only have occurred at Tabreez during the past four weeks. On the 24th ultimo a sortie was attempted against the Royalist army, and the Nationalists succeeded in capturing one position, but nothing further was achieved, as the bulk of their forces remained in their trenches ; their loss is stated to have been thirty-four killed and wounded. An ineffectual bombardment of the town took place on the 5th instant, and a few shells were fired on the 14th instant, and some slight skirmishing took place the same day, but no definite engagement has taken place._ _ Meanwhile supplies in Tabreez had begun to run short, and famine was beginning to make itself felt, especially among the non-combatants. In view of the prevailing distress, it was but to be expected that a disposition to open negotiations should manifest itself among certain sections of the population, and that the Shah should endeavour to reduce the town by the well-worn method of spreading dissension among the besieo-ed. Certain delegates were sent to the Royalist camp at Basmmch, not, as I understand, officially representing the Nationalist party, but with their consent. My telegrams of these last days will have kept His Majesty’s Government informed regarding these negotiations and the general situation in labreez. The pioposals of the local Assembly, which the Russian and British Consuls-General were requested to press upon the’Shah through their respective Legations, and which were to the effect that supplies should be permitted to enter the town, and that delegates should be chosen to treat with the Shah and other tow r ns with a view to a general settlement, we r e such as His Majesty could scarcely be expected to listen to at a moment when events pointed towards the surrender of the Nationalist centre which had thiough so many months held out against him. The Turkish Charge d’Affaires had two days previously pointed out the desperate condition of his nationals in the beleaguered city, and had addressed a note to the Foreign Minister. Mr. Wratislaw, in telegraphing yesterday to me the conditions for an armistice laid down by the local Assembly, informed me that the amount of grain available for public consumption was less than he had been given to understand, and stated that there was a probability of riots taking place wdiich might endanger the lives of the foreigners. To-day Mr. Wratislaw has informed me that the possibility of an attack on the foreigners had become very rea l In view of this very serious news, I to-day consulted with the Russiarp Charge d’Affaires, with whom I have been in constant communication regarding the situation, and we have decided to seek a joint audience of the Shah to-morrow and to press upon His Majesty the urgent necessity of protecting the lives of the foreigners at Tabreez, which appear now to be in imminent danger.122 I have just learned that the Shah will receive us to-morrow, and I shall have the honour to report the result of this audience in a separate despatch. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. No. 282. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received May 10.) Sir, Tehran, April 20, 1909. I DO not think it is necessary to trouble you with an account of the numerous conversations I have had with my Russian colleague on the subject of the critical turn affairs in Tabreez have lately taken, as my telegrams and those of Mr. Consul-General Wratislaw will have kept you fully informed of the course of events. As reported in my telegram of to-day, we decided late last night, in view of the urgency of the case, to ask for a joint audience of the Shah for the following day in order to urge upon His Majesty the necessity of granting a truce and of allowing the introduction of food in order to avoid the threatened attack on our Consulates and fellow subjects at Tabreez. The audience took place this morning between 11 and 12. I began by making the usual inquiries as to His Majesty’s health and immediately proceeded to read the state ment, of which I have the honour to inclose a copy, a translation of which Mr Churchill, who was present as well as M. Baronowsky, read to the Shah. His Majesty said that he would give a reply, after carefully considering the matter, through the Minister for foreign Affairs, but he desired to say that he had four days ago ordered his troops before Tabreez to desist from all hostilities pending the negotia tions which were in progress, but that last night hostilities were opened by the rebels, and were still in progress. Speaking on behalf of myself and of my Russian colleague, I informed the Shah that we were not concerned with the rights and wrongs of the struggle at Tabreez. The matter 'was too urgent to admit of discussion. We were face to face with a situation which presented the gravest perils for our respective Consuls and fellow-subjects there. I strongly urged His Majesty to give orders that an armistice should be declared and that supplies should be allowed to enter the town in order to avert the danger which threatened. The Shah seemed to have some doubt as to the existence of provisions in the neighbourhood and repeated that the rebels were attacking his forces, and asked whether his Generals were to await such attacks with their arms folded. I said that if His Majesty declared that an armistice would be observed by him for a given period and if supplies were, during such truce, allowed into the town, my Russian colleague and T would instruct our Consuls to use all their influence to prevent the Nationalists from attacking. The Shah said that Delegates had been sent to Basminch from Tabreez to discuss terms of peace with him and that the people of Tabreez were ready to submit but that, for all this, the rebels under arms, as distinct from the peaceful population with whom he had no quarrel, had made a determined attack on his forces. Was he at this juncture to allow provisions into the town ? I again impressed on the Shah the grave danger to which our Consuls and fellow subjects were exposed : a situation which demanded immediate action. Every minute was of importance if a catastrophe was to be avoided. M. Sabline joined in this earnest appeal. r l he Shah replied that he had for nine months been endeavouring to get the mastery of the Tabreez rebels, and for this purpose he had besieged the town and stopped the entry of supplies. They were now in sore straits. Was he at this juncture to allow supplies in and thus undo all the work which had been done by his forces ? I said,^ in reply, that His Majesty was only asked by us to declare a temporary cessation of hostilities and to allow a limited quantity of provisions to enter the town which would at any rate avert the imminent danger to our Consuls and nationals. Ihe Shah replied that he did not know why the foreign Consuls and subjects did not leave the town, to which M. Sabline and I answered that such a course was, under the circumstances, quite out of the question. My Russian colleague added :— a Our Consuls cannot leave their fellow subjects in Tabreez—the interests at stake are too great; and the numerous Russian subjects in the town cannot go out—they123 have their families and property to think of. If we thought your Majesty could protect them we would ask you to do so ; hut you cannot. We must therefore insist that your Majesty will comply with our representations. Mr. Miller, who is known to your Majesty, has telegraphed to me that there is imminent danger of an attack, and I fear it may occur at any moment. Therefore 1 cannot sufficiently impress upon your Majesty the importance of immediate action. I would even add that the country is at stake.” The Shah appeared to be much impressed by this appeal, and after some further discussion agreed to send a telegram to Ain-ed-Dowleh to hold his hand for six days (i.e., until midday on Monday, the 26th April), during which time provisions approxi mately required for that period will be allowed to enter the city on condition that no attack is made in the interval on the Royalist forces. M. Sabline and I undertook on our side to instruct the Consuls-General at Tabreez to communicate these terms to the Nationalists, and to use all their influence to prevent the resumption by them of hostilities. We informed the Shah during the course of the audience, which lasted three- quarters of an hour, and at which the Minister for Foreign Affairs was present, that we proposed to wait upon him again the following day, in order to make represen tations of a more general character in accordance with the formal instructions of our two Governments. On returning to the Legation I received a message from the Shah, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, communicating the following telegram which he had just received from Ain-ed-Dowleh :— “ The rebels only want to gain time, as they expect a relieving force from Urumia and Salmas which will attack Serdar Nosret. There is absolutely no doubt that two nuns have reached Salmas from Urumia. ’ © The Shah desired it to be understood that, should this force attack his troops, the armistice would he considered at an end. I replied that I agreed on this point, and my Russian colleague subsequently gave a similar reply. . We have sent identic instructions to the British and Russian Consuls-General at Tabreez in the above sense, and it seems that for the time being the danger has been averted. X nave, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY, Inclosure in No. 282. Note read (in translation) to Shah of Persia. THE situation of our fellow subjects at Tabreez is serious in the extreme. It seems that the food in the town is so scarce that the people are desperate, and there is reason to apprehend that an attack on the British and Russian Consulates-General is in contemplation in order to secure provisions. _ . . In these circumstances, the Representatives of Great Britain and Russia aie compelled to point out to your Majesty that the two Governments will hold him personally responsible for any harm which may come to their fellow-subjects and to the Consulates General in Tabreez. _ _ We have sought an audience to-day in order to indicate to your Majesty the only way of preventing the deplorable outrage threatened, and in view of the impossibility in which your MAjesty's Government finds itself of protecting oui subjects at^ Tabieez, we are compelled to insist on the immediate necessity of pacifying the population of the town by granting a truce and by promptly taking the necessary measures for the introduction of food for the starving populace. Sir, No. 283. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 10.) Tehran, April 22, 1909. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the monthly summary of events in Persia for the last four weeks. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY.124 Inclosure in No. 283, Monthly Summary, Tehran. THE political situation at Tehran during the past four weeks has been unchanged. Sani-ed-Dowleh, First President of the late Medjliss, took refuge at His Majesty’s Legation on the 27th March with some of his relatives, on the plea that his life was in danger. They stated that they desired to leave for Europe, and the Shah gave them permission to do so. They have all now left the Legation, and some of them have actually left Tehran, but Sani-ed-Dowleh still remains in his house. A few days later a prominent preacher, called Etemad-ul-Zakerin, took refuge at the Legation, having escaped, with a bullet wound in the arm, from Shah Abdul Azim on the night of the 23rd March, when several persons were murdered. He is still at the Legation. M. Baronowsky, the Russian Dragoman, returned from leave during the course of the month and had a private audience of the Shah which lasted over two hours, at which His Majesty declared his intention of re-establishing the constitutional regime. His Majesty’s Minister and M. Sabline had audiences of the Shah on the 20th and 22nd April, (Signed) Q, P, CHURCHILL, April 22, 1909. Resht. The town has remained quiet and order has been preserved. It is stated that a force of Nationalists under Sipahdar is about to start for Tehran, Traffic on the -1 Tehran road has remained uninterrupted. 1 Astrabad. It appears that the Jaferbai Turkomans telegraphed to the Shah some time ago that they were on his side, and would disperse the Nationalists if he sent them a Commander. The Nationalists sent one Haji Rahim Khan to collect the Turkoman Chiefs and ask them to take the oath of fidelity to the Nationalist cause. The Turkomans murdered him and plundered his property, carrying off 5,000 cattle. His body was subsequently recovered, and buried by the Nationalists with great pomp. On the 27th March some twenty Nationalists arrived at Bunder Gez and seized the telegraph office and customs house. On the 28th March some 3,000 people with red flags went out to bring the f - Nationalists into the town of Astrabad, which they entered shouting “Long live the Constitution ” and “ Down with Mahommed Ali.” On the 1st April about twenty Nationalists arrested the Karguzar, who was suspected of having accompanied the Russian Consul to the Jaferbai Turkomans’ camp, to induce them to upset the local Assembly. • The Karguzar was afterwards released through the intervention of the Russian Consul. The latest news is that the town is surrounded by Turkomans, who are acting on the Shah’s behalf. Fighting is proceeding, and the Russian Consul has applied for troops to be sent in to Astrabad. Meshed. The disturbances opened on the 7th April with the throwing of a bomb into the house of the new Governor-General’s nephew, who was temporarily in command of the troops. The anti-Government party then seized the telegraph office, but did not interfere with the European signallers. Guns were placed in position to protect the ark, and all soldiers were withdrawn from the city, where some of them had been disarmed. On the 8th intense excitement prevailed, and it was decided to attack the ark, hut no attack was made. The local Assembly was reconstituted, and telegrams announcing the fact were sent all over Persia. On the 9th the Deputy Governor was imprisoned by the local Assembly, hut was released two days later on taking the oathof fidelity to that body. During the next week much money was collected, and this divided the Assembly into several parties and made united action impossible. Both Consulates received letters from the local Assembly, with a request that their subjects should be warned not to join in the fray. It was also seriously intended to ask both Consulates to withdraw from the city, in order to give the Assembly a free hand, the fact being that their proximity to the ark and arsenal, and the certainty that they would resent fighting in their vicinity, made for peace. The new Governor-General still remains at Nishapur on his way to Meshed. Turbat-i-Haidari. Early in March Adal-ed-Dowleh was dismissed from the Governorship of Turbat. On the night of the 14th March Yawar Asadulla at the head of 200 well-armed Baluchis entered Turbat and took possession of the town, installing himself m the house of_ the Governor. He killed the Deputy Governor, an old enemy of hkn The town remained quiet and Salar Khan, who assumed the management of affairs from the Yawar, published the following circular :—“ We are Constitutionalists and desire only the peace and well-being of all. Foreigners and others are informed that life and property will be respected. All are warned that nobody should leave their houses after sunset. A censorship was established over the post and telegraph offices, but there was no interference with British or Russian correspondence. The people appeared quite satisfied with the turn events had taken. Kerman* On the 7th April His Majesty’s Consul telegraphed that the roads to Kerman the Meshed road excepted, were in the hands of robbery the posts of five weeks were held up and the prices of provisions bad risen greatly. On the 13th he telegraphed that hungry crowds were rushing the bakers’ shops, bread was scarce and there was no authority in the town. On the 16th he reported that Han Naib had been appointed Kalantar of the town and had taken strong action with the result that the state of the town was better. Yezd. Samsam-es-Sultaneh, Bakhtiari, has telegraphed to Nain that he has heard that the town is in a disorderly state and advising the people to be quiet, otherwise he Will have to send horsemen to restore order. The telegram ended with an inquiry as to when it would be convenient for horsemen to come to collect the first instalment ol npxt vear’s revenue, No answer was given to this telegram. , , • By the end of March most of the Parsee villagers had returned to their villacms but no attempt had been made to restore to them their property, on i he contrary, it was stated that small parties of Mahommedans were still blackmai mg them fhe le general state of the country round Yezd shows no improvement. The Postal service is dislocated and no road is free from robbers. The ISam road, which had been comparatively safe for some .time, has relapsed. into insecurity Europeans in Yezd have at last been provided with guards, but it is doubtful if the lattei. y remain long unless they get their pay more regularly than was the case with previous detachments. Kermanshah. A serious disturbance took place on the 27th March. On the 25th, a Jew convert to Christianity, by trade a stocking seller, beat bis apprentice, a young Seyyid. _ 1 e boy returned home, ate bis dinner and slept well, but next morning, after am mg Several times, be died. The hospital assistant attached to His Majesty s Consulate attended the boy, and told the boy’s brother that, in bis opinion, there was no connection Ween the boy’s death and the beating be had received Two Persian doctors also attended the boy. The boy’s brother made no complaint, but the stocking seller vas arrested and certain Seyyids, who are well-known bad characters forbade the burial of the body which they required to carry round in order to inflame the people against the Jews A message to His Majesty’s Consul that the Jewish quarter would probably be looted unfortunately failed toreach him. The next day one of the Seyyids went to the Governor and, under threat of creating a not demanded the instant execution of the126 Jew-Christian. The Seyyids also compelled several of the chief priests to support their demand. The Governor, fearing a religious riot and hoping to end the matter, ordered the instant execution of the Jew without further inquiry. The unfortunate and innocent man having been executed the looting of the Jewish quarter was at once begun. The Governor, though warned, took no steps to prevent the looting in which his soldiers took part. On receiving messages from Captain Haworth and the Hussian Consul, however, he displayed some vigour, and prevented the Alliance Israelite School being harmed. The most important part of the quarter had, however, been stripped of everything, even doors and windows being removed. A Jewish British subject had his house entirely stripped, but Captain Haworths escort were in time to rescue him and his family, who were brought to the Consulate. There were no Jews killed outright, but many died of their wounds. The Governor’s weakness and want of force were the cause oi the disturbance. His regiment and the artillery were alike conspicuous in the looting. 1 he guard at our hospital, when remonstrated with for taking part, replied that it was by the Governor’s order. Captain Haworth telegraphed to His Majesty’s Minister asking that the Governor might be dismissed. Subsequent to the raid the chief priests spoke very strongly against it, and disclaimed all responsibility for it, and the Governor entrusted to them the task of recovering the looted property and restoring it to the Jews. A good deal of property has been restored. Captain Haworth reports that he has been much astonished by the practical sympathy shown by the Mahomedans in sending food and covering to the Jews. He adds that many Jews owe their lives to Mahomedans who, in some cases, actually stood armed in front of their Jewish friends until they could take them to their own houses. It is openly admitted that the Jew-Christian was innocent and that his apprentice died a natural death. The Governor, Zahir-ul-Mulk, himself admits that the executed man was innocent, and says he executed him to prevent a riot. . ^ tb April it was rumoured that an attack was to be made on the Jews, this time on their li\ es, and not on their property. A large number of the more impoitant Jews in Kermanshah are Babis, and a picture ot the Bab, found among the stolen goods, appears to have excited some of the hooligans in the bazaar. All the Jews who were Turkish subjects took refuge in the Turkish Consulate and the leading Persian Jews in our Consulate. Captain Haworth and the Turkish Consul obtained from the Govemoi a written guarantee for the safety of the Jewish quarter, which was strongly ganisoned that night by soldiers and riflemen. While Captain Haworth was arranging for the removal of the refugees to the house of the local Representative of the Persian Foreign Office, the Mahommedan chief priest sent word that he would look after them. As they were willing, Captain Haworth sent them to him, and he had them escorted safely to their homes. Early in April the Mahommedan chief priest was suspected of wishing to pioclaim the adheience of Eermanshah to the Nationalist cause, but up to date this has not been done. At Hamad an the Nationalist movement collapsed on the arrival of a new Deputy Governor with troops, but the movement is likely to recommence. /V/ 1 - 00 *^ ;^ iail ’.th e R&amp;lhur Chief, has patched up a friendship with Sher Khan, mte Chief of the Sinjabis, and has agreed to reinstate him. It appears that Habibullah Khan who is at present Governor of Kasr-hShirin, will have to vacate that position and the Ghiefship of his tribe. Daood Khan, it will be seen, practically appoints or dismisses the Governor of Kasr without reference to what the supreme Government may desire, and also dictates who shall be Chief of the Sinjabis; Shiraz, The constitutional agitation continued during the first half of March, and the Govemoi-General continued his policy of masterly inactivity. On the 24th a very important meeting was held which was attended by Nasr-ed-Dowleh, Ata-ed-Dowleh, and the Governor-Generals Vazir, and by numerous representatives of all classes, the hist proceeding M^as a speech by Alem-uhHuda m praise of union and Constitution. Ihe whole assembly acclaimed the Constitution. A long discussion followed, in the course of which it was decided to inaugurate the constitutional Government of Jars the^ following day, to send messengers to Sheikh Zakariyeh and Seyyid Ahdul^ Hussain to induce them to remain quiet, and also to SoulaCed- Dowleh to enlist his support. Telegrams announcing the reinstitution of the Consti tution m Shiraz were also to be sent to all parts of Persia. The first result of this meeting was the visit to the Consulate on the following morning of Moin-ul-Islam, oneof the more civilized members of the popular party. Having requested Mr. Bill to make notes of what he said, he made the following statement: The movement had^ been going on for some time, but had been delayed by the necessity of obtaining unanimity by negotiation with the Kawamis, &amp;c. All parties were now agreed on the object of the movement, which was the attainment of the national rights as provided in the Constitution to which the Shah had sworn. The leaders were all “democratic reformers ; ” but all others, including the Governor-General, had now come m. At the meeting held on the 24th it was agreed that fifty persons should be chosen, including all members of the former local Assembly, to meet in the building which was formerly made over to the use of the local Assembly, on the afternoon of the 26th. It was to be opened by the Governor-General, in conjunction with Mirza Ibrahim. The object of all parties was to conciliate the good-will of foreign Powers, especially the two neigh bouring Powers, and of these especially Great Britain, as a Parliamentary countiy. Unfortunately this programme has not made much progress. The fifty members duly met as proposed, but not under the presidency of the Governor-Generah On the 24th the latter telegraphed to the Grand Vizier in apologetic terms, to the effect that a meeting of all the principal persons of Shiraz had decided to establish a local Assembly, and he was helpless. To this no direct reply seems to have been sent, but on the 26th a telegram arrived from the Grand Vizier to the Governor-General, Kawam-ul-Muik, Nazir-ul-Mulk, and others of the nobility, assuring them that all would be well, and that troops were about to start for Ispahan. The Assembly met as arranged m a Government building on the 25th, 27th, 28th, and 30th, under the presidency of the Governor-General’s Vazir. They seem to have talked a great deal, and to have come to the following decisions :— (a.) Buies of procedure. Assembly to meet for three hours three times a-week. No member to bring in any followers; language of debate to be simple, without titles or flowery forms of address. (b.) Telegrams to be sent to Tabreez, Ispahan, and Nejef. . . (c.) Messengers to be sent to Seyyid Abdul Hussain, Sheikh Zakariyeh and Soulat-ed- Dowleh. The object of the two former was to be to cause the Sheikh to return to Bar, now that the National cause had triumphed ; and of the latter to persuade the Soulat to charge himself with the maintenance of order on the road to Busline, by Kazerun or Firuzabad, as he might prefer, and to invite him to come and confer with his friends in Shiraz. ^ , , . , • , • i (d.) Nasr-ed-Dowleh to be entrusted with the Ispahan road, and to be maintained in charge of the Khamsa tribes. ini* i i (e.) Pending an arrangement with Soulat-ed-Dowleh the Busline road to be patrolled as far as Kazerun by fifty men, having then head-quarters at Khaneh Zmia (fi) Ata-ecB Dowleh to take the usual precautions against a rise in prices by punishing any one exporting food-stufis. The Committees, though much discussed, have not yet been elected. Asef-ed-Dowleh visited the Assembly, and made a long speech to the effect that he had been with them in heart all along. i-i.ii j. ‘u Altogether the most important events were those which took place outside the Council chamber. It appears that in spite of apparent unanimity the Shirazis are as hopelessly divided as ever; and there seems to be a real danger that the ultimate result of these divisions may be that Sheikh Zakariyeh, who has been invited by the extreme Constitutionalists, may come to Shiraz unopposed merely because, though all hate and fear him, they cannot bring themselves to trust one another sufficiently to unite in resisting him by force. . . . i 'i r™ cm Writing on the 3rd April Mr. Bill described the situation as very bad. the Shahs authority was dead, at any rate temporarily, and there was no faith in the Assembly, His visitors all asked him what was to be the end. n The condition of the roads is very bad indeed. Posts are frequently robbed on both the Ispahan and Bushire roads. On the 28th March a postal waggon m which Mr. Linton, of the Church Missionary Society, was travelling was robbed near Dehbid. This robbery is important, as the Governor had sent a strong telegram through His Maiesty’s Consulate to Dehbid, directing that a strong guard should be supplied, and there were present on the road no less than three parties sent out to inquire into the robbery of Messrs. Ziegler’s agent, so that the bankruptcy of the local authority may fairly be said to be demonstrated. The whole road almost up to Ispahan itself seems to be atthe mercy of bands of robber tribesmen who either attack passing caravans or plunder the villages near the road. In one case a caravan of pilgrims was attacked, but the pilgrims, being numerous and armed, were able to beat off the attack with a loss to the attackers of two men killed. (Signed) C. B. STOKES, Major, Military Attache. No. 284. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Kdicard Grey.—[Received May 10.) ^_ Tehran, April 22, 1909. SINCE writing my despatch of the 24th ultimo I have during the present month forwarded to you the various telegraphic reports which have reached me from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire in regard to the development of the situation at that place consequent on the action of certain Nationalists and more especially that of Seyyid Murteza Ahremi in taking over the conduct of the local Government. the attitude of Seyyid Murteza has, indeed, been the determining feature of the movement It is evident that without his initiative and the considerable force of riflemen of which he has been able to dispose it would not have been possible for the Nationalist party so easily to overthrow the Shah’s authority, but, though the Seyyid at the beginning professed his allegiance to the Nationalist cause with much vehemence, A has become increasingly clear that he has throughout been actuated rather by a desire for personal gain than by any more disinterested motives. The force which he introduced hrto^ the town is composed of tribesmen of the immediate hinterland of which the Seyyid is also a native, and the troubles which have taken place under the Seyyid s regime have been entirely due to their lawlessness. The looting of a portion of the bazaar on the 7 th instant by these men and the serious danger of further excesses necessitated the landing of a force from His Maiesty’s ship “ Fox,” which had recently been ordered to Bushire. Public order has been fairly well maintained, but the continued presence of the riflemen, wlmm the Seyyid refuses to remove, keeps the population in a constant state of alarm. The Nationalists are now unanimous in repudiating the Seyyid, but they are unable to expel hinp from the town, as they wish to do, without assistance. With legai d to the question of the customs revenue, the Seyyid, after agreeing to the anangement by which, after subtraction of a certain sum for current Nationalist expenses, the balance-should be held in trust by three “trustworthy” Persian merchants, succeeded in undermining the honesty of these three persons and appropriated all the money on deposit. In all he has had from the customs 20,000 tomans. ~ I he present position is that, pending the conclusion of an entirely satisfactory airangement with the responsible Nationalist leaders, the receipts are to be retained on the customs premises in the possession of the Belgian officials, and 1 have authorized Major Cox to use the presence of the bluejackets at the custom-house in order to prevent the beyyid from making any further seizure.

Ml ivussian colleague and I, accompanied by our dragomans, were received hi audience by the Shah this morning, when I read to His Majesty the statement of which I have the honour to inclose a copy herewith. His Majesty, who listened with attention to the translation which Mr. Churchill read out to him—even asking for a passage which he failed at first to grasp to be read over again—replied in the following terms ;—- lu is evident that Great Britain and Eussia, as friendly and neighbouring Powers, aie keenly interested in the prosperity of Persia. I have therefore received the repre129 sentations which have now been made to me with much satisfaction, and I shall, after consultation, communicate my reply through my Minister for Foreign Affairs.” I asked when we might expect to receive His Majesty’s reply, to which the Shah replied that it would be given very soon, We then withdrew. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. Inclosure in No. 285. Note read (in translation) to Shah of Persia. IT is now nearly four months since the Representatives of His Britannic Majesty and of His Imperial Majesty the Czar last advised your Majesty jointly to fulfil the pledges so repeatedly given to your people and to the two Representatives to re-establish constitutional government in Persia. Unfortunately for your Majesty and for your unhappy country—unfortunately, too, for the interests of Great Britain and Russia—your Majesty has persisted in violating these pledges, and in following the advice of evil counsellors rather than the wise counsels of the two neighbouring and friendly Powers, with the result that the situation has gone from bad to worse, and that it is now difficult to point to any part of the country, except the capital, where the Central Government has any authority. Not only are the principal towns in revolt against the present reactionary system, but the general condition of anarchy has spread so as to be well-nigh irreparable—a state of things not only disastrous for your Majesty and your subjects, but also fraught with great injury to the nationals of the two neighbouring Powers. Had your Majesty followed the friendly advice of the two neighbouring Powers four months ago the state of Persia would have been very different from the deplorable condition of affairs existing to-day, which has become a byeword amongst the civilized nations of the world. Had your Majesty fulfilled your pledges four months ago, a reconciliation between your Majesty and your Majesty’s people would have ensued immediately, and there is no reason to doubt that in a short space of time the united efforts of your Majesty and of a constitutional Government would have brought about a notable improvement in the general condition of the country. Your Majesty s persistent failure to fulfil your pledges has produced a situation where the restoration of order will be a task of extreme difficulty. Nevertheless, the two Representatives feel that there is no reason to despair provided that your Majesty loses no time in abandoning the present deplorable methods of government, which, since the destruction of the Medjliss last summer, your Majesty has been following under the advice of men who have proved themselves the enemies of their country. But if your Majesty delays further the fulfilment of your pledges, then, indeed, there will be no hope of your Majesty’s succeeding in arresting the growing anarchy. It is in this conviction that the two friendly and neighbouring Powers, whose sole desire is to see Persia emerge from the present deplorable crisis an independent, well- governed, and prosperous nation, after careful consideration of the situation in all its bearings, have instructed their Representatives to seek a joint audience of your Majesty, and to make to your Majesty the following recommendations. In making the communication which follows, the two Representatives are instructed by their two Governments to declare categorically to your Majesty that, if your Majesty does not accept in all its details the programme now recommended by the two Powers, the two Powers will desist from giving advice, and will leave your Majesty to your own resources, and your Majesty will no longer be able to count on any support from them or their agents. Point 1. Mushir-es-Sultaneh and Amir Bahadur Jang to be removed from their offices. Amir Bahadur Jang to be removed not only from the Cabinet, but also from any office in the Palace. _ Point 2. After the introduction of the following reforms, the Shah to re-establish a constitutional regime. Point 3. The appointment of a Cabinet composed of persons worthy of confidence, and the addition, without delay, to the Council of the Empire of enlightened persons belonging to different parties. ' The Council to elaborate and promulgate a new Electoral [504j K130 Law. If the Shah chooses people for the Cabinet or Council not inspiring confidence no money advances will be made to Persia. 1 hint 4. The immediate proclamation of a general amnesty to cover all those who ha\ e taken up arms against the Shah and who have committed political offences, but to exclude those who have committed offences against the common law. As regards these latter and those who have committed acts of brigandage, guarantees to be given by the 1 ersian Government that they shall have an impartial trial. r i ^ ^ b® immediately fixed for the elections and for the convocation of the Assembly. These dates to be made known without delay to the whole country. Po ^t G. As soon as the measures enumerated in paragraphs 1 to 5 have been taken by the Shah, the Kussian Government may, if it thinks necessary, make an advance to the Persian Government for the urgent expenses necessitated by the introduction of reforms, of 100,000/. I he British Government will, if it considers it necessary, make a similar advance to the Persian Government, as soon as the elected Assembly has adopted this advance. If it is afterwards found necessary to facilitate a larger loan to Persia this could only be effected under certain guarantees, which will form the object of a subsequent exchange of views between the two Governments and the Persian Government. Animated by the sincere desire to assist Persia in the crisis of extreme gravity through which she is now passing, the Cabinets of London and St. Petersburgh have agreed on this programme of friendly advice to be given to the Shah, and the two Governments believe that the execution of the programme in question, is the only means loi Persia of escaping from her present almost inextricable situation.

No. 287. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received May 10.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, May 10 1909. 1HE Shah has to-day issued a rescript ordering that, “in pursuance of the tundamental law (constitution) without any alteration,” a number of learned constitutionalists, trusted by the Government and people, be added to the council and immediately draft an electoral law. The elections will be commenced immediately after the promulgation of this law, which will be made without delay. The National Assembly will be opened in the same place as formerly when two-thirds of the deputies are ready to take their seats. The Shah has adopted our suggestions, and the Cabinet, we think, is as satisfactory as circumstances permit. Saad-ed-Dowleh will hold the position of Prime Minister until the return of Nasr-ul-Mulk. A general amnesty for political offences, with licence for exiles to return, has been proclaimed m a separate decree. 4.1 P ar C0 P; SU 1 S a l fbe various centres of revolt are being instructed to point out to tie Nationalists that it is now their duty to do everything in their power to secure a reconciliation between the Popular party and the Shah.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100043128905.0x000002_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/20/260/3</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100043128905.0x000002</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/20/260/3</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Persia.
