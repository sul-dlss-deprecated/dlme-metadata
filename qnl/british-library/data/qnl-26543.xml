CGNF 1 JaikATION OF LEA^nS OF &amp;A.TF IBN HATHLaI^ A liD IBN LAIvilt LiiAiJ^KS lij TJax, AKiUAx-j TiMOiJL Over a year ago and on the outbreak of hostilities between Bin Saud and Yemen, the v/riter reported that the above two Shaikhs together with sultan Ibn Humaid of the Ataiba had been secretly transferred to Hoffuf and there placed under the care of Ibn Jiluwi. The general Badav/in view held at the time was that, this would certainly mean the death of the above- mentioned persons, a w s the Governor of Hassa, kept an underground dungeon (known as the T, habas al Shaina”) from which no one was ever known to come out alive. That these views have unfortunately turned out correct is now certain, for the widow of Ibn Hathlain visited the writer on 2nd November and confirmed that the King had authorized her to marry again and had given the same permission to Ibn Lami*s wife. The latter married one parhan ibn Khudaiyir in October last. This Royal permission for the ladies to remarry is proof positive tha-u t .e Shaikhs in question are now dead. There remains Sultan bin Humaid - Reliable news of his demise has not yet come in, though the tribal reports say that he too is dead. s£§&gt; 6/3 &gt; Jiritish i egatior , r— Jeddn 25 th Jamary 1934 U 5 FEB 1954 Zy attention has been drawn to the desirability of elucidating the facta connected uith the alleged murder of certain -ta*ddi state ^riaonera, including !bn dithlain and Xbn L&amp;s&amp;l, in view of the ruaours reproduced in recent Kuwait Intelligence &lt;:'3itt!aiaries v notably that for etober. As you are awere f X have no menne whatsoever of investigating such a natter here but when Kr*Calvert « my attention to the reports on ay return fract le^ve t l agreed with, him that they deeerved careful attention, t may say* however, with great deference to Col*idofeson*a greater knowledge of rabian life, that X thought it unlikely that Ibn ?)»*$&lt;! would bwak his word in a matter of this kind and e^iually unlikely that he would challenge the hostility of important sections of the Ajn&amp;n, Mutair and Atcyba tribes at a time when he was ao deeply embroiled in hie difficulties with the Xitftai Ye ya. 2« In these circumstances, 1 decided to put a straight .-ra^ati,o u-v .■ . .j ©oul,:; d oraily* I told him on December ^9 Uiat, while I did not normally attach importance to such rumours, those regarding the three prisoners in question were so positive /and 1 ight Honourable, Sir John Simon, 0 ,£.;$•!., K.C.V* i., etc*, etc*, etc.and so p^r»8i«tent as to ou&amp;geat malicious invention or distortion of scmsic thing that had happened* I was not sayself, I said, ready to be Hove that ih* ring would autiioriae the execution of men w o«e lives he had pledged himself to respect# on the contrary l *ias concerned* as a friend, for His fchHesty’a credit and preferred to inquire at once in that capacity rather than await instructions to Investigate the matter as being one of legitimate interest to Hie 4a^eety*s Oovamaent* 3. guad Bay reminded me, quite justly, that tie King’s pledge did not apply to Ibn humald (^?ult«n ibti Jiujad) whose name I hud mer»tloned with the ot^ier®. m begged me to believe that the King waa incapable of breaking his praise but he undertook to inquire into the facts* a uanusry 10 he conveyed to me Uxe King’s aes?uranee tnat Ibn ,„&amp;jai and Xbn Kithluln were alive, and told me in reply to an inquiry, which I ex res sly put as a matter of curiosity, that Ibn Buj^d was also alive# aving received in the Meantime Col# ileksoa*e report for lecembtr, which cast doubt on the original murder story, i said to Fuad Bey that I now had reason to believe that the thiee BKeyk s had been removed to Kofuf ana thought that this might given rise to the first reports* Fuad I3ey pror-’ 1 ■ted to inquiiHS further. On Jaiaiary 04 f when I reverted to the matter * he renewed the King’s assurance that the men were alive but said that ills ajesty begged to be exeueedy forreasons of internal policy# fro® disclosing their wiiereabouts. 4* X do not feel that I can pursue tha matter furtiwjr 9 unless you consider that the precise nature of the treatnent of Ibn Hithlain and Ibn “.ftsti ia a matter of such raoraent to Hi* Majesty*® ^ovemaent as to justify them in calling the i* ing to account for his harshness, on the strength of runoura, which, however probable, cannot be proved. 3uch action mi-dit outrage him so greatly as to produce a definite coolness between him and Hi* Majesty* a Government. I am not myself in favour of it and I do not think it would in any way help the two 3heykhs. X cannot doubt the Ting 1 * formal assurance that they are alive. I have little doubt that they have been in fact removed to Mofllf and X believe Ibn Jiluwi, the Governor of Ha*** to be a cruel gaoler, but X do not think that even Ibn .Tiluwi would murder these men in defiance of the King. In my opinion, wl at X nave already done will at least 'uffice to remind Ibn Ga'dd that Hi* hajeaty’a aover«®aent are not indifferent to the fate of Ibn Kithlain and Xbn ,Smi. 5* I took an opportunity in the course of my conversations with ‘bad bey of euggeetln* that the King might well, after this lapse of time, relax hia severity and treat these prisoners in the same way as many others who are kept under a sort of open arrest at Kiy&amp;dh. 1 cannot be sure that Musd hey would pas© this on to theKing **ut I think th* be®t hap« for t.ww unfortunate men is that, when hi# dreaent trouble# are ended f Xbn a^dd will relent isomewnat* e ha# already aiiown «ign® of anxiety to diftans iioetility tmong the AJntn and Nlutair* A# for Ibn , uraaid, r^uad Bey told me #dontaneou«Xy Uiat appeal# had been nade to the King on hi# behalf tout had not been auoceaeful* le added that Iton Uaaid was not really bad -hearted tout rather a oiraple soul • 1 recalled the time w^Jen he had been no good a ae?*vant that he had been one of the conquerors of Mecca* 5* I am sending a copy of tuis despatch to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

Juma related that he was himself present when they were removed from prison in Hath, a week before the haikh of ^.atar arrived at the Capital (1st eptember). ihe circumstances were as follows:- (i^ oix of Bin Jaloui f s cars. 6 cylinder Buick, 4 lorries and 1 Chevrolet arrived at Biath from Hoffuf bringing Amir Fai»al , 8 wife (the grand-daughter of Ibn Jaloui). (ii) Bin Baud seized opportunity of aenaing the following prisoners to Hoffuf in the cars: Buitan ibn Haraaid, Naif ibn Hathlain, Ibn Lami, 14 other Ataiba Shaikhs. (iii ■ Ihe greatest secrecy was observed during their removal, which took place at 11.30 P.M. All approaches to the prison were guarded, and, drivers were forbidden to blow horns either in liath or at Hoffuf on arrival. 'iv) The prisoners when brought out looked ill and worn, ibn Hathlain's left arm was still in splints, as result of beating he had received when he was suspected of having*connived at the attempted escape of Ateiba l haikh last Bummer (reported). (v) Cars left at midnight and made fast journey to Hoffuf under guard of 18 selected slaves of Ibn Jaloui - Chevrolet in front, 4 lorries in centre and big Buick in rear. fvi) Convoy entered Hoffuf also at midnight in greatest secrecy ana prisoners were placed in the iUT prison in underground dungeons. (vii) Juraa received details of journey from the fomali driver of the 8 cylinder Buick’ (his friend) who returned to I iath 8 days after, with Abdulla bin Thani, Shaikh of ^atar. (viii) Juma was told by this driver that if prisoners were not secretly executed by Ibn Haloui, as the Negro guards opined they would be, they could not long survive the dungeon life where no light penetrated at all. (ix^ Juma’s view was that the ing intended them to be secretly put away, and so had sent them to Bin Jaloui • The above I believe to be the true story of the many contra dictory rumours that have come up to Kuwait regarding the execution of the Piath prisoners. Nor do I think the latter had even a sporting chance, once they were transferred to the Amir of Hassa's unlovely hands.lb) tain Th® aX&amp;o brou^tit too nciwi that i t was ^irett^ timt the now faiaoua Hi a ti t prieo ere bln Xw : a Utal Ibn had been murdered by Bin baud's orders# Xhey had apparently been eent in 3 lorries oatenaiblor to Hei^fur* in response to the lone* made demand o£ Xbn Jaloua f that the prisoners should be dealt wi .u by him* Xhv lorries had* it seems* nerer reached Hoffuf.#'but returned empty to Math the miXt day* It was everywhere in Plath whispered that the prisoners had boor, phot end buried in the b&amp;h&amp;na sands by a party sent byylbn Jaloui to tuJi'o them over • In this connection see para V*blix) and /• c*(i ol this olliC- Summary i‘or August 1933* fha story o-f the murder of th%a&gt;~ unfortunate wretches has reached Kuwait from so many oourc a touring Septci her aiid October that X cannot but come to the regretful conclusion that the inoident is true*i£h« kpmm and Mutair tr bcsa hoping against ho^ that Ibn iiaVnX&amp;in and Ibn i4uiiif bheir ohir itai a wt:j*€' stiXX aXir , hnr% n £u&amp;a&amp; so far to btliorc that Ibn Saud would l^iid hlmoolf to auoh a dastardly deed, but oven they have r :ei ed th moelveo to what they believe to be the truth at % laat* It io aaid that no one but memboro of Bin Saud 1 ® slave bodyguard acoompanled the prisoners when they set out in the lorries, and that even the lorry driv» rs were slaves.
