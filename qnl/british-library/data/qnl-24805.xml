Dispensary. I forward herewith copy of letter No* 481, dated 15th March, 1945, with enclosures from the political $gont, Kuwait. ? The political value of the Agency Dispensary is considerable and it must be.remembered th^t trie only other dispensary or hospital in Kuwait is the Mission ospital which is staffed almost entirely by essential that the Agency dispensary continue to function and that it should be accommodated in a suitable Duiloing in a proper state of repair. I therefore recommend that the Government of India sanction an increase in the rent* from Rupees 180/- to Rupees 960/- per annum payable from the date yfxTwgraigg the repairs are completed landlom. Since the amount of Rupees 780/- cannot be met from the grants at my disposal I request that this sum be sanctioned as recurring extra annual grant. I should be grateful if the Government of India's orders .may be communicated, to me by telegram to ensure that repairs mx to the building are atnrtfid ©t the earliest possible date. - BRITAIN The issue of the above has been authorised.

Approximately 200 new cases and 350 recurring cases are treated at the dispensary eveiy month. I have the honour to be f Sir. Your most obedient servant, 3d* G*N* Jackson* Political Agent, Kuwait.

I wish to say that owing to the hi^i cost' of building mJberials since 1940 and the fact that we have not inc|reas9d the rent since ^ 1933. although rents here increased six to eight tiries, we jiave ^not been able to afford to repair our building let toyoiu as a dispensary* ^enairs can now no longer be put off an we” need to spend Bs. 2000/- on the house to make it even waterproof* 7e shall be glad if you will now agree to increase the rent to Hs* 80/- per month, if we do the repairs, or to Bs* 50/- per month if you do the repairs* —• Copy of a note dated the 27th January, 1945, from the Medical Officer, Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwait* I request that seme necessary repaid and minor alternations &gt; may please be done to the building which houses the present Agency Charitable Oigponsary in Kuwait* At present it is a dismal Tam ruin* The landlord Haji Tusuf Behbahani refuses to rapy id repair the house as the rental is too small* viz* Bs* 15/- per month. May the question of an enhanced rent be taken up at the same time and some form of contract arranged making him responsible for annual upkeep. The essential rajggri repairs and alternations are :- 1 1. The whole building, outside walls and inside rooms to be re - gutch - plastered* 2. A sky - light to be built into the roof of the inner upstairs room, to brighten it* At present it is impossible to work there as it is too dark* 3. Hoofs to be made rain - proof* 4. Painting of windows and doors* 5* The room upstairs to be divided by wooden partition so that half may be used to interview patients and' half as an f xamination and dressing room* resh fly - pro$f gauze to all the windows and doors.
