Registration of Government Property. 73 49 37INTRODUCTION . In compiling this Index Register, obsolete major heads occurring in the previous Registers have been eliminated. Territorial heads like '19. Bahrain', '35. Muscat', '53. Kuwait', etc., have also been dispensed with. The files in current use have been re-arranged, and numbered consecutively under each of the new heads without leaving a gap, according to the subject matter to which they relate, irrespective of the territorial jurisdiction. 2. The omnibus major head '13.Miscellaneous' which consisted nearly of 300 files has been greatly curtailed and several new major heads appropriate to the nature of the subjects have been opened. it has not been found feasible to eliminate this head altogether and it is hoped that only papers of a miscellaneous nature that cannot be classified under a more suitable and well- defined major head will be put on these files. 3. rhe territorial heads should never be revived under any circumstances. The criterion should be to open new major heads if necessary according to the subject matter but not according to the place to which a subject may relate. 4. The bound volumes under the 'A' Series are meant for purposes of reference only. A list of the existing bound volumes under the 'A' Series and an alphabetical • index of their subject matter is also being separately compiled.. periodical 'weeding' out of the files is essential and a list of files destroyed from time to time should be invariably maintained as much time will otherv/ise be wasted by the succeeding generations of staff. /5. In the....5. In the current files (which are numbered under the 'B' -Series according to this Index Register), references to the closed volumes under the 'A' Series have been given wherever possible. 6. For the successful working of this system the compilations in the Inward and the Outward Registers should be invariably marked, and its importance need not therefore be over-emphasised.

The list of common A series files, with their B series numbers (folios 2-5a) is arranged numerically by A series file number (1 through to 92). The index to the main headings (folios 6-12) is arranged alphabetically. The main headings (folios 15-241) are arranged by the heading number. Many of the main headings were allocated several folios to accommodate future expansion to the lists, the result being that there is often one or more blank folios included at the back of each list where the additional space was never required.</extent><extent>Foliation: The volume is foliated from the front cover to the inside back cover, using circled pencil numbers in the top-right corner of each folio. The following foliation anomalies occur: 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e, 1f, 5a.Condition: There is a small amount of insect damage towards the front and back of the volume, in the form of small holes in the paper. This damage is not sufficient to impair the legibility of any of the volume’s contents.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume is an index of those files created by staff at the Persian Gulf Residency, that came under the general heading ‘B Series’. The B Series was created in 1945 from those A Series files (see the A Series index at Z/R/15/1/1) that remained open at this time. New B series files were opened until the closure of the Residency in 1947. The bulk of the volume is made up of lists of files, arranged under subject heading numbered from 1 through to 95. The file lists under each subject heading include a file number, file title, and original (A Series) file number. There is an explanatory introduction to the index on folios 13-14.The original lists in the volume are typewritten, with additional annotations in pen. The lists, including many of the handwritten additions, are a duplicate of those in IOR/Z/R/15/1/2. Comparison of the two volumes would suggest that this volume was copied at a later date from IOR/Z/R/15/1/2.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100022598726.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
