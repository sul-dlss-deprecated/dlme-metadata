'PANGKOR' was requested to bring all particulars with him, and on the morning of Thursday 9th July, 1942, the defective sections of the pump were put in a car, and Naval Officer-in-Charge, together with the Engineer Officer^ proceeded to Awali, where the General Manager (Mr. Ward Anderson) was interviewed and the situation explained, that unless his Company undertook the job of repairing the defective pump, the ship v /ould be unable to proceed. 4.- The General Manager at once called his Principal Engineer (Mr. Fifer) and instructed him to give every possible immediate assistance, after which the defective parts were then taken to the Machine Shop, where the Chief Mechanic(Lir. Briaxi Agar) got busy on the job, and within the space of one hour the defect had been made good, and we were all on our way in the car back to Jufair, with the result that 'PANGKOR' was able to sail for her destination at 1600 hours L.T. today 9th July, 1942,^ (Sgd).•.• W.J.

'^esang'*• The information was contained in a personal letter from Mr, Squire to my wife. 2. The Captain of the ship is an Indian Lieutenant. He sleeps and has his meals in a cabin near the bridge. The officers consist of 6 B.O.R.s. Sleeping accommodation for passengers is provided in a single small two bvmk cabin adjacent to the saloon. The cabin has two windows which •will not shut properly. Mr. Squire had not got his own oed with him and was lent from the ship's stores a pair of dirty sheets, a pillow and two quilts. There is on3.y one saloon which is almost filled by a single table just sufficient to seat the 6 B.O.H.s and two passengers. Mr. Squire reports that the table was covered with a filthy cloth which could not have been changed or cleaned for many weeks. The food provided was adequate in quantity but was served on unwashed plates from dishes covered with flies and had to be eaten with dirty cutlery. There is no place to sit except in the exiouous cabin or at the table in the saloon. The only amenity in the ship is a wireless set. The senior li.O.R., a sergeant, was pleasant and ooliging. The captain of the ship was on the bridge or in his cabin during the whole of the passage and scarcely appeared at all. Yours sincerely, The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel C-G.
