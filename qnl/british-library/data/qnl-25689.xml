'SHOREHAM” sailed for Sharjah in the forenoon of 15th August, the Shaikh of Debai, Shaikh Juma, and the Residency Agent being given a passage. The Shaikl of Sharjah called on arrival and left under salute of 3 guns. I returned this call later in the forenoon. 28. As His Excellency the Viceroy had accepted my invitation to dine on board ’’SHOREHAM”, various transport arrangements were made ashore. The Residency Agent and his Clerk were most helpful, and besides building a small pier at the lagoon landing place, also constructed arches of palm leaves and obtained sufficient carpets to make a path fully a hundred yards long over the sand. 29. Their Excellencies arrived at 1800 and a salute of 31 guns was fired as the aeroplane came to rest. Accompanied by my staff, I was present at the aerodrome and delivered the Commander-in-Chief’s message of greeting. The Shaikh of Sharjah also fired a salute of 31 guns f rom his battery which took well over an hour and fortunately without accident. I presented the Residency Agent and the Shaikhs of Debai and Sharjah also Shaikh Juma to Their Excellencies, and there followed a display of horsemanship. 30. The Residency Agent* s car (a very old Ford) was later used to convey Lord and Lady Willingdon to the lagoon: they were accompanied by H.E’s. personal secretary and Aide-de-Camp and a friend.

Lord Willing don, Viceroy and Governor General of India, At Sharjah. Your Excellency* The ^*stor_y wi the relation betvveen the High British Government and the Sheiihs of the Oman coast is too we* .-novvn. to ^our Excellency to need a repetition and I shai*, therefore* confxne myse-f only to that portion which concerns me directly. In tue year 1922 when the British Government decided to establish an air route along the Arabian ^oast, the Hon^le the Political Resiuent in the Persian Gull approached some oi us notably the Sheil&lt;hs of Dubai and Ras-el-Bhaima - with a view to fixing up a suitaole site for a rest house and lanumg ground, but, in spite of the offer of large sums o* money and other inducements, none of them accommodated the British Government. The relation between the successive Sheilfos 01 Sharjah - of the Juasom family - and the British Government has been very coj dial from the very beginning ( nearly a hundred and forty years now) and having been always desirous of maintaining that friendhsip and if possible further cementing it, I volunteered to give the site for the aerodrome ana rest-house. All my subjects, even my own brothers, ana the entire population of the Oman coast almost to a man were against me and my very life was threatened but, I disregarded everyone and all consequences ana thinking only of the frienahsip with the high B-i-i-n D-ivln the concession as I entered into an agreement * o requiredrequired by the Governmeni. The immediate consequences v.ere. that a good number oi my subjects deserted me ana X became the enemy or all without exception. I tool every rUk the ful1 confluence that I will have the help n*. protection of the British Government if need but unfortunately, events since the agreement have proved and c l* 8 sling is gaining greuna in me more and more as days go by that instead of being in the favour of the British Government I am helu at a greater distance than any of the other Sheiihs oi the Oman coast. I have aone no y»rc‘ng to the Government but i: I have done anything and has fallen unaer the displeasure ox the British Government, I request that I be tola so that I might hasten to make amenus. On the contrary if I am no t guilty I request that a more consiaerate treatment be given to me in the fu tu re. Sharjah, 16 m 5 'S 4. Sd/- Sultan bin Sagar.C onfic e ri . The Resiaency, B.O.Kc. 567-S of 1934 . Bushire, the 22nd June 1934 M.y dear Metcalfe, •Please refer to your deni-official letter Bo. D.2720-&amp;/34, dated the lith June ' ! 9 , 4 v-oirc-n ~ V sj*xi enclosing copies ci the two addresses which Lord Willingdon on his way home received from the Shailh of Sharjah. ‘i. With regard to the address of welcome. Presuitably Lord Willingdon made a suitable acknowledgment vhen it was hanaed to him by the Shaikh, and I hardly think that any further reply is Necessary? 3. With regard to the complaint against Government. I attach a draft reply which I suggest could be sent tn rough me. there is one Shaikh more than another on the Arab Coast who has been treated w&amp;ll by Government it is Sharjah. It is true that - as I have pointed out ’ in my draft reply - he agreed to give a site for the aerodrome when the other Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast refused, but for this he was amply rewarded, and the fact that the Air Port is situated in his territory has been the making of him and his people. Hot unnaturally but unfortunately, the added importance which the Port has given him ( he is really a very minor Shaikh) has gone to his head. * 4. One mate matter which may be worrying ^ a the Shaikh is that of his Post Office. This was offeree ✓ yy him by the Indian Postal Authorities, but the Government of India on financial grounds - (the sum involved was aoout Rs. 25/- per mensem) suggested that the oiler shouldShould be withdrawn (vide Poieign ^ Political Department demi-official letter Ho. D.2097-H/33, dated the 1st Juno 1®2£). If this suggestion h«d been carried out I thin^ th a t the Shailh would have had a legitimate complaint. Against this suggestion, however, I battled at length and more or less successfully (vide my demi-ofi rcial letter Ho. 1389, dated the 1st July 1933 ). 17',e situation is now as described in Galloway's demi-offici Ho. 1055, dated the 3rd May 1934, and I hope some solution will be possible 3cj£ before very long* Another aa&amp;tter v»hich I daresay is exercising the Shaikh's mim may be his W/T station. In this connection please see corresponderce ending with my letter -No. 984, dated the 28th April 1934. What with Oil, Air Ports, Civil Air Agreements, ana so forth, all the Shaikhs along i the Arab Coast are now opening their mouths very wide imeed, like bears at the Zoo, expecting Government, and the various Companies concerned, to throw them a succession of large buno. It would have a most salutary effect if \ e were in a position, every now ana then, to refuse a bun, and I trust (ana expect) that in connection with the W/? the subsidy expected by the Shaikh will not be forthcoming* 6* A third, point is that the Shaikh has thrown out hints from time to time that he Wants his salute ox o guns increased. I nay sooe future date put this up to Government, but think that for the moment the Shaikh has got _uite enough out of us* 7. As you will see the Shaikh has no grounas oi complaint against Government, in £.ct quite the contrary, end I hah thought of making the draft reply to him much ^re peremptory. However, in view of the feet that the Air Port is in his territory we do not want to rub him upDr ait Letter Shai-Kh Sultan bin Saqr, Rtler or Sharjah. After Compliments, SxceJlfeiicy - the Viceroy of Inara h a s directed me to reply to your letter dated the 16th May'i934, fehich you handed to His Excellency X on his journey through Sharjah. His Excellency appreciates that ■ ^Q&amp;^^sd to give a site for ai^ aerodrome and rest house at Sharjah, when others did not do so, but he directs me to point out that large pecuniary benefits have been received both by you and your people, and that employment is given for a number oi your people as guards and in other capacities. The High Government also arranged that the British India Steam Navigation Company Limited’s stesmers shoulu call at Sharjah whicu has been of much benefit to the trade of Sharjah. Wireless communication is also of benefit to you and your people anu the question of establishing postal facilities ~n Sha^^a.* is unuer discussion. In short, His Excellency considers that there have thus been mutual advantages in these matters and in view oi the large benefits which you and your people have received he does not think that there is any cause for you to feel that you are in favour with the British Government.
