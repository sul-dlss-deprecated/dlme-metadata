Dear Chancery, Young tells me that you hope to get the position of the Bushire Vice-Consul, particularly from the point of view of housing, reconsidered by the Foreign Office. I am not well qualified to speak of the position generally, as I have not been here long, and have not yet had to set up an establishment of my own. I can, however, present it as it affects me personally, and presumably anyone coming to the post under the same conditions as I. In present circumstances a Vice-Consul coming to Bushire finds a house of questionable suitability, unfurnished and unfurnishable locally. For a matter of weeks or months, it depends on how far he v/as aware of local conditions before his arrival, he is dependent on casual hospitality, which is fortunately usually forthcoming. There is of course nowhere, apart from private houses, where he can stay temporarily. It seems to me that there are two distinct questions, that of house accommodation, and that of furniture. Any permanent solution of the former is, I think, too radical to be seriously contemplated; at the same time the’e is an offer of bungalows far in excess of the demand, and I hope to be able to find one reasonably suited to European habits and ideas which might become a quasi-permanent base for the Vice-Consul. The house which Todd occupied seemed to me, on my only visit, intolerably hot, and is overlooked by a vast warren of a place in the same compound which has been let to a/ To His Majesty’s Legation, Tehrana Persian family since he left. I have brought the contract to an end* Assuming that I can find a suitable house, there remains the problem off mishing it. The reasonable expectation, to my mind, is that the Vice-Consul should find on arrival an it immediately habitable somewhere, presupposing a permanent nucleus of indispensable furniture. It does not seem unreasonable that the Vice-Consul in future should be able to count on such a nucleus so that he might be indepent of hospitality from the day of his arrival, or that this nucleus should be Government property. There is not even an accumulated legacy of past years; the position of the Vice- Consul in this respect is unique among the European residents. If the Vice-Consul is left to depend for furniture on what he himself possesses or his predecessor leaves (in my case, nothing on either count), he is liable in each case to have to import a houseful from India, a slow and expensive process; when he leaves, if he cannot hand on to his successor, he is unable to dispose of it locally and has no altern tive but, figuratively, to shoulder his losses and his furniture as cheerfully as he may. The peculiarities of the position which seem to me to justify the provision of Government furniture are; the lack of temporary accommodation generally; the impossibility of acquiring or disposing of ’uropean furniture locally; and the difficulty and expense of transport to and from Bushire. If the Vice-Consul has the misfortune to be transferred here from another part of Iran after his original nine months’ franchise has lapsed, he is worse off by the large sum payable as Customs duty on any furniture he may have to import. Standing instructions as on page 146 (Rule 38) of the Foreign Office list do seem to cover cases of, I imagine,this kind. I can only suggest that that authority might be quotedto Justify a claim that the position of Vice-Consul in Bushire been brought into line with that in other posts where similar conditions prevail; though apparently such preferential treatment may not normally be extended to Vice-Consuls. If the request for Government-provided furniture is wrecked on this snag, an increase in transfer allowance, where payable, would help matters, but it would do nothing to overcome what I consider to be the main difficulty, that the Vice-Consul has no immediately habitable home on his arrival here. Incidentally according to my information, the late Trapman, while probationer in Addis Ababa, was allowed to charge his furniture to (rover ment; and even Addis cannot be more devoid of facilities than Bushire. I doubt though if one can lean too heavily on precedent. X append an estimate of cost of the minimum of furniture which X should have to import. The figunes were supplied by the Assistant Sngineer of the Indian P.W.D. here, who has recently provided furniture on this scale for the Agency at Gwadur, and were approved by the department and by the Political Agent at Muscat. The total cost landed in Bushire would be 87-92 pounds, and the cost in India Rs.860 or £ 66 . If annual rent was paid at 7# of cost in India (that is, excluding freight and landing charges, the total expenditure would be recovered in 18-19 years. A higher rate of rent, say at 10 years’ purchase, would not perhaps be an undue burden on future Vice-Consuls when the alternative is considered. I cannot think or a more practical scheme* I am sorry if t e length of this exceeds what you expected and wan ed from me; it is no doubt amenable to considerable condensation. I shall of course be very grateful if any enterprise of yours bears fruit in my time here. Yours ever, Vice-Consulate.From - xo - (3 The Under Secretary to the Uovernwent of India in the Ixternal Affairs Departaent. The ion f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.
