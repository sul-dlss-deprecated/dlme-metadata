'JK7,. 5734 1 0 0 3 |V.i- THE RESIDENCY, ADEN, 30th August 1933* With reference to your demi-official letter to Fraser-Tytler of the 27th July 1933 regarding the “Aden Labour Association 1 ', I have now been asked by the Government of India to furnish you with a report in the matter. 2. The Organization first came to our notice in November 1932, when its self-appointed committee applied to the Residency for recognition and assistance. The purposes of the Association as stated in the draft Rules, and as otherwise declared, were to provide assistance to Aden-born native working classes in unemployment,sickness, old age, and indigence, and generally to look after their welfare and interests. The manner of the application and the composition of the controlling committee were not all that could be desired, and Colonel Reilly therefore with held his support on the grounds that he was not yet satisfied of the bona fides of the organization or that the funds then being collected would be wisely expended. 3. The original organizer and prime mover of the Association was an Egyptian agitator,Naser Muhran, who, having come to Aden in 1931 had subsequently been dismissed from various employments, and finding himself at a loose end, devoted his energies in the cause of the Aden-born unemployed, who had not previously expressed or been con scious of grievances. During the first half of this year J. G. LAtTHWAlTE, Esquire, India Office, London. #f t. (3) - 2 - Naser Muhran’s conduct in the leadership oi* tne movement became progressively more violent and obnoxious ? until in July, he was arrested, and deported to Egypt* 4* The extent of unemployment among natives of Aden has not greatly or suddenly increased during recent years, nor is it now so serious as to cause any considerable misgiving. Nevertheless it does exist, and is in some degree attributable to Yemeni and Protectorate labour that has free access to the Settlement, but principally to general economic conditions. Now that the subversive and dangerous influence of Naser Munran has been removed, I am therefore making an investigation into the matter, particularly with a view to ascertaining the extent of real unemployment among the Aden-born, and the trades and occupations in which it is most prevalent. I have already suggested to the few remaining leaders of the movement the establishment of a small employment bureau, which I propose to support and encourage provided that it is conducted in a proper and orderly manner, but not otherwise. The further question of the possibility or desirability of bringing official persuasion or pressure to bear on the employers of labour in Aden to give any measure of preference of employment to the Aden-born will depend upon the outcome of the investigations to which I have referred. 5. The 'Aden Labour Association” as such has ceased to exist. 6. In regard to the specific point raised by Mr*Lunn, the statement made by the Association in their memorandum that, ^ou will never find one of them (the •Aden-born) employed in a skilled or unskilled job, •especially in the Government offices most of the clerks f are Goanese and not British subjects and if they are they •are not born in Aden*, is utterly irresponsible and has no basis in fact. Aden-born British subjects of Arab,0 Somali, and other races are largely represented in Govern ment and other offices and employments* That they are not more so is due to the low standard of educational attainment that has hitherto been reached in the Aden Schools. This has been recognized for some time by the Residency, and during recent years much has been done to improve the situation. 7. Of unskilled or coolie labour, it is probable that the majority is provided by Arabs from the Yemen and the Protectorate, for the reason that the hillmen from those localities who engage in it are of better physique than residents in the enervating climate of Aden* 8* In conclusion I would observe that the •Associa- tion n did not receive recognition by the Residency, by reason of the irregularity of its methods and the doubtful character of its promoters and leaders; and I therefore hope that, having died a natural death, it will not be encouraged to resurrection in its old form by the knowledge that its former memorandum to the M secretary of the Parliamentary Labour Party” has received official attention.
