This section includes a note on Henderson's visit written by Major Tom Hickinbotham, Britain's Political Agent in Bahrain (folios 95-97).The file also contains correspondence regarding a visit that Henderson's successor, George Wadsworth, planned to make to Bahrain in 1947 but that was eventually cancelled (folios 111-120).The majority of the correspondence in the file is between British officials, but the file also includes a limited amount of correspondence with US officials, local rulers (some of which is in Arabic), and the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ambassador to Iraq</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>State visits</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000126#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000126#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000126#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
