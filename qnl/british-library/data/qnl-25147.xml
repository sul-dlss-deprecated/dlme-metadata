Italy's object, without doubt, is to establish heiself in, and form protectorate over, very rich province of Yemen. To have a European Power contiguous to British protectorate would be very objectionable ; future complications and military operations would certainly result. 11 Italian protectorate of Yemen is allowed we shall lose all Arabian trade, entire local revenue, Aden will become mere naval coaling station , besides, Turks undertook not to alienate to any third Power Subehi country enclosed by English protectorate on the south, and on the north by Kuddam, Jebel Akkara, Jebel Akama, and Jebel Numan. See report of Fitzmaunce, 30th April 1905 ; moreover, occupation of the country would cause very gieat disturbance amongst, and involve us in great difficulties with, the tribes ot Arabia under protection of the British Government.

A notification to this effect was accordingly communi cated to British merchants and vessels.

Pray urge investigation of this matter; also represent that there is danger to me and property to British subjects at Hodeidah, and ask if it would be possible, in view of the very short notice given, to extend period for vessels clearing outwards, so as to enable British subjects to leave, if they wish to, with their belongings.

In reply to your telegram No.l of this series of the ^ ' instant, Hodeidah might perhaps as a garrison town he considered a 'fortified place' as defined by the Hague Convention, but in no other sense, as to the best of my knowledge it possesses no guns or works for coast defence purposes. According to the Turks there is one work on the land side, and they also admit one old Arab stone fort which is without guns, but I am making further enquiries at Hodeidah. The military commandant there is responsible for the protection of foreign subjects from the Mohammedan element, but little anxiety need be entertained in this 1 respect.4 CONFIDENTIAL.

Italian commandant reports that it was the local authorities at Hodeidah who had [?] impeded the embarkation of the goods of European subjects on steamers destined for their removal. He had ordered the “ Piemonte ” to place Europeans in safety, and to threaten reprisals against forts, barracks, and Government buildings if embarkation of such goods was further impeded, but not to act on the menace without further orders. Commandant has asked for instructions as to the extent of the reprisals sanctioned. Reply from a Ministerial medium was that forts, barracks, and military edifices might be bombarded with due previous notice to the consuls and local authorities. Bombardment of military works not having permanently defensive character should be preceded by orders to destroy them within a brief specified term. All possible care to be exercised not to damage European interests. No news has yet been received by the Italian Government of the bombardment of Hodeidah reported in the French press.

WITH reference to the affairs in Hedjaz I have the honour to report that after the declaration of war between Turkey and Italy two sambuks, one named “ Sharq ” and the other “Assad,” both carrying Italian flag, were captured in the harbour of Jeddah by the local Turkish authorities. r lhe owners of these sambuks are Italian subjects residing in Massowah. The sambuk “ Sharq” was hound for Confudah, and part of the goods on board was property of one British Indian merchant named Abdul Cadir Habibullah. I am in correspondence with the local Turkish authorities for the recovery of the goods belonging to the British Indian merchant named above. On the 7th instant two Turkish gun-hoats, “ Aintab ” and “ Ordou,” and one torpedo destroyer, “ Paik-i-Shevekat,” arrived here from the south. Next da}^ all three left the port, and their destination is not known here. “ On the 8th October, 1911, four big guns arrived from Taif, each was drawn by six camels. These guns were afterwards placed on the provisional sand embankment on the sea coast near the non-Mahommedan cemetery. The garrison of Jeddah was strengthened on the 8th October by the arrival from Taif of 238 soldiers with the kaimakam of the forces in the Hedjaz. Munir Pasha, the commander of the forces in the Hedjaz, also arrived here on the 15th instant from Taif. I may mention that the Italian consulate here was closed at the request of the local Turkish authorities on the 2nd October, 1911, and my Russian colleague, in his capacity as acting Austrian vice-consul, is in charge of the Italian interests. A telegram was received by the local agent of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company on the 10th instant, which reads as follows :— “ Steamers carrying food-stuff, Hodeidah Jeddah, liable capture by Italian war ships. British resident, Aden, ordered Humayun Naseri discharge Jeddah cargo. Arrange take delivery Aden.” On the receipt of this telegram a sort of scare spread all over the place, and the price of the food-stuffs went up considerably. On the following day a meeting of the local merchants was convened under the auspices of the municipality, and a schedule of rates of food-stuffs was agreed upon, which is to run unchanged for fifteen days. The following is the statement of the rates of the principal articles of food as agreed upon by the meeting as compared with the rates current previous to the receipt of the telegram containing news of the prohibition of food supply of Jeddah and Hodeidah:— [2266 n~ 1]Names of Articles. Price agreed. Old Prices. Rice, Rari .. .. T.P. 120 per bag.

Ghee (clarified butter) 54 „ &gt;&gt; 48 „ The prices agreed upon by the municipal meeting are only on paper, and the merchants who are masters of the situation sell their goods as best as it suits them. The state of the country, which depends entirely on food-stuff, can better be imagined than described on the receipt of such startling news, especially at this time of the year, when there are thousands of pilgrims of all nationalities chiefly from vast British dependencies. It was in the interests of British Indian residents and the pilgrims that 1 ventured to telegraph to your Excellency on the point. The foolish people here, misunderstanding the orders of the resident at Aden, think that it is the British Government who had stopped the supply of food-stulfs. The food*stuffs are always sold here at famine rates, particularly in the Haj season, and what will be the rates this season, with no supply from abroad, it is hard to realise. I have, &amp;c. S.
