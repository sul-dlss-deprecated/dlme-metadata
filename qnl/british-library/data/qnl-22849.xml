My dear Lincoln, with reference to Mr. Eikington's letter to you of 21st November, the Chief Engineer-jpf our s.s. rr Khuzistsn rr has now renorted upon his examination of the Political Agency launch 'John Lambert' at Bahrein, and I enclose a copy of our Marine Superintending Engineer's memorandum with regard to the 'pproximate cost of the repairs .reouired. You will opreci te th : t untiV-'the 'machinery is opened up for inspection we cannot ptive a close estimate. If it is recuired that we should undertake the work here, we should be willing to arr n^e toware by the s. s.''Khuzistan'', but it would be necessary for us first to order the boiler tubes re uired nd further to ensure that our floating dock would be free before the launch was brought up. We should h ve to make a nominal charge for towage by the s.s.'Khuzistan' based on the actual time involved. As Bahrein is n early port of call, it v/ould be necessary for the 'Khuzistan' to put in there on the way back and further to take the launch into Bushire which is usually her last port. It must be understood that any such towage is entirely at owners risk and that circumstances of bad weather might necessitate the Master cutting the launch adrift and the Politica,! gent would no doubt, therefore, wish to cover these risks by insurance. We shall be glad to hear from you further upon this matter in due course. Dr.. C.H.Lincoln, O .B .E,, Mohammerah. Yours sincerely, c ) J. J. CvW, London, 10/28. 59. 333 A.L. COPY .

Date .3.r.d...D..e..c..e.mb.e.r....l.92..9,..,., Bahrein Consular Launch 'John Lam bert' . Further to previous correspondence in this connection, we have now received from the Chief Engineer of the 'Khuzistan' his report and have also had an opportunity of discussing his findings with him. He informs us that the original defect list was prepared, as far as he could ascertain, by an Officer of the 'Crocus', who it appears advised the Political Agent that the repairs would cost about £.100. In this connection we would point out that item (1) alone - Boat to be placed on slip, cleaned and coated - would cost about £.95 (cjharging half rate of hire for Floating Dock as another vessel could be docked at the same time), while item (13) Boiler - Plain tubes (74 in number) ext. dia. 2-|- n , length 6'7^', to be renewed v 'ould cost about £.80, including testing of boiler. As the reamininf? items collectively could not be done under £.125, making a total of £.300, we rather imagine the Political Agent is under a misapprehension as to the ultimate cost. Further our engineer reports other repairs being necessary, viz and we would consider it advisable to overhaul the main engines, boiler and boiler mountings etc. We must make it clear that we regret we could not undertake a complete and satisfactory overhaul under £.500, but we would be prepared to give a closer estimate on the craft and machinery being opened up for complete examination. The above is exclusive of towage costs (if any) at Owner's risk to and from Bahrein. We should also add that we do not stock boiler tubes of the size necessary and these would have to be obtained from India or the U.K. Windlass to overhaul Condenser to test Circulating Pump to overhaul etc We shall be glad of any further instructions Sd.

Reference your Memorandum of 14th November 1929 No .14£8, in accordance with the list of repairs submitted, the estimated cost of repairs roughly works out to Rs»2,500/- exclusive of supply of boiler tubes which are not available either in the local market here or in this directorate stores. Therefore it will be advisable for you to obtain the tubes direct from the makers of the launch i.e., R.I,M, Dockyard, Kadderpore, Calcutta. This Directorate does not undertake work on a commercial basis and as I have only to rely on the list of repairs supplied by you, the estimated cost mentioned above may vary on examination of the vessel.

Dear Sir, Launch ox tlie Political Re si gent, ,5ahrein» We have to advise you that this vessel has now been examined in dook and we regret to report that the 'bottom plating is in a very bad state* About 3i? plates comprising the Keel strake ana the two adjacent strikes ( a &amp; b) port and starboard, are badly wasted away and holed in several places. Two of the worst plates - in the keel strake - we are renewing at this time, but we are afraid to remove any others as it will be impossible to stop without a very considerable bill being incurred. As a temporary measure we are spot welding the worst of the pitting marks and holes and hope by so doing to give the vessel another two years of life* At the end of that time we fear a new bottom will be required and this would cost anything up to JSl8oO {including dock hire) and the work take 30 days to execute. Meanwhile the expenditure will not exceed £4-50* If, as we are advised by the Serang, this vessel had practically a new bottom fitted 4 years ago in Basrah, the deterioration has been extraordinarily rapid and can only be ascribed to the craft being left for long periods on the beach - high but not dry. The plating that could be attended to I.e., chipped &amp; painted, under these conditions (we refer to the sidesfo - 2 - of the vessel) is in a very good state of preservation* The boiler trouble is due to the 'boiler having been left full of water for long periods when not under steam. The recognised procedure in such cases is to empty the boiler of water, dry with stove, and place inside perforated trays containing charcoal, coke or lime, thereafter closing up the boiler air-tight. This proceeding keeps the surfaces dry and arrests corrosion such as you have experienced* 'e will supply you with a couple of trays for this purpose. e recommend further that the vessel should not be beached unless absolutely unavoidable as the hull is so thin that any inequalities of ground would tend to pierce the shell* We are not aware of the duties this craft is called upon to perform, but oeiore going to the expense of a new bottom Jwe should imagine it would be to the advantage of the Political IHesident to consider the substitution for this vessel of a Imodern Diesel-engined craft, the advantages of which are that 'the vessel is ready for sea at a moment's xiotice and that running costs are reduced generally by about $0%* Te hope to have the vessel ready to return about the end of the month and will endeavour to fill up with coal bunkers as you desire* Yours faithfully, for Anglo-Persian Oil Compaq Ltd., Sdf.

Complete reports of the work done will be sent to you in aue course, but it will suffice here to say - (1) That the boiler has been given a complete overhaul and a new set of plain tubes fitted. (2) That the machinery, other than overhauling the condenser and patching hotwell tanks, has not required any other than in significant repairs. (3) That certain minor deck repairs have been effected and (4) That the repairs effected to the hull in drydock, see our SD /I69 /D /71 /12 of 22nd May addressed to H.B.M♦s.Vice-Consul, Mohammerah, should with care extend the life of the hull until 1932~33» though it would be perhaps advisable to have a further examination in aock in about 15 months time, if only for the purpose of renewing the underwater paint.- 2 - w inalass is not considered worth the expense (which would be consiaerable) of repairing. ^ 0n a trial run this morning over the measured mile the following speeds were obtained;- Down (with current) 9,3 knots.

I regret tiiat i am unable to give full particulars regarding the S.L 'John Lambert' am to her towing power and boiler (though it is not clear what information is required regarding the boiler; as we have no information regarding them. The launch,however,was clearly built as a tug and so presumably should be able to perform the normal duties of a tug of this size. 3. After overhaul in May 193u the Anglq ^ersian Oil Company Limited gave her speed to be 7i knots over a measured mile. She has not been oocked since tiien and her speed lias naturally deteriorated. 4. The launch was built in the Royal i^arine Lockyard at Kidderpore in 1 c j 18. She was given a thorough overhaul in May 1930 and new boiler tubes were fitted and her machinery generally is,l believe,in very good condition and good for some years of work. The bottom plates,however, are not in good condition and will probably require renewal in the near future. 1 regret I cannot say what service is still left in her as this is a technical matter. 5. it is difficult to quote the price delivered in Karachi. The British India Steam Navigation Company declined to tow her to Abadan as it interfered with their mail contract and the work was done by the S.S 'Khuzistan' at'a ca^bm period of the year. The launch is not small and will be a considerable drag on any vessel which tows her and even if towed by a warship wo u l^ probably be obligedto abandon her if rough weather ensued,consequently it would not be safe to send down whilst there is any chance of rough weather. One might ask Hs.5,000/- but any price quoted is open to the argument that since such launches have no market at the moment ahe is valueless. The reason for sale is,ofcourse,known to you.

Freight to England woula,ofcourse,be a very serious item, though a Strick line boat or even a ; ansa liner would probably be glad to mote you a special price lor a direct shipment. I think the only chance of getting a good price is to sell the launch in lin-iand. I canU quite remember the oirnensione of the Bandar Abbas launch^but,! think,it must be about 35 feet by or 10 and cabin cruisers of this type seem to De changing lianas in England for about £.350 when of mature age.

I snould imagine the launch's condition must be # quite good for Ficnarason lookea after everything attachea to the Consulate very carefully,but,as the launch is copper plated it may be necessary to know what has happened underneath the copper before you could -ive any opinion about its condition.

To:- The Secretary to the Hon^le the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire# Sir, I have the honour to refer to my telegram No:T/3 dated the 9th June 1933 and to request that,if,as I am told,the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited no longer require her,the 'Pelix Jones* may be placed at ray disposal for use in Bahrain. 2. I was doubtful whether she had sufficiently good sea going qualities for her to be suitable for Bahrain, but officers on board H.M.S 'Powey' hare told me that they have seen the 'Pelix Jones' at work in a fairly heavy sea and that she should meet my requirements for Bahrain,especially if some top hamper can be removed. In the circumstances I should like to try her. It is L /&gt;' &gt; v • ■ imp^sirtTOe that she will fetch any price,if sold,and re-conditioning her and removing the top hamper should be much less costly than building a new launch. 3. I do not know the conditions under which the 'Pelix Jones* was placed at the disposal of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited,but presumably it was stipulated that at the end of their lease,they should hand her back in as good a condition as she was handed to them. I gather that a considerable m Political Agency, Bahrain,the June 1933.2 a considerable amount of re-conditioning will be required, as she has been used for heavy work and I would suggest that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited might be asked to re-condition her thoroughly at Abadan and,in addition, to carry out such work as may be necessary to make her a really smart launch again. Part of this expenditure might (subject to the conditions of the lease) fairly be met by the Company and part by Government. It is possible,also, that the Company might be prepared to carry her free from Henjam to Abadan and from Abadan to Bahrain by tanker. 4. If the Hobble the Political Resident agrees in principle that the launch may be placed at my disposal,! would suggest that I might be permitted to correspond with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited direct on the subject of the overhaul and that I might be supplied with the Blue Print of the launch and any information about her that may be available from the Residency files. In particular I should like to be supplied with a copy of the annual budget for the launch while she was used at Bandar Abbas.

The best for the civilian is not the best for the soldier—the best for an Endowment Policy with profits is not the best for the same kind of policy without profits. And a multitude of other ways that only an unbiassed expert can tell you. 2 LIFE ASSURANCE CAN HELP YOU by lifting obligations off your shoulders that death would not cancel, but merely shift on to the shoulders of your dependents, perhaps ill-equipped to bear them. You must wish to continue a sufficient income for the main tenance of your wife and children—or to clear the house you leave of mortgage—to pay outstanding accounts, or perhaps death duties. THE REASON THAT F. P. BAKER &amp; CO. HAVE ACHIEVED SUCH PHENOMENAL SUCCESS WITH INSURANCE % IN RECENT YEARS IS BECAUSE THEY REALISED THESE FACTS AND ORGANISED FOR THEIR OWN CLIENTELE A SOURCE OF EXCEPTIONAL ADVICE FROM EXCEPTIONALLY QUALIFIED INSURANCE CONSULTANTS. 3 THE ADVANTAGES WE OFFER. Confident of the advantages to our clients, we do most strongly recommend you to make enquiries of us. We supply all information free, and gladly to our clientele. It is well to have it by you. You may or may not decide to take advantage of the chance now offered. Send us a post-card, state the reference of this notice G/PDI70, state also the investment scheme or schemes you would like information about, give your date of birth, occupation, if abroad, where you are, and how much you could afford to invest as premium year by year. We can then show you what advantages we could secure for you. Do it now, while you think of it. PROBLEMS FOR WHICH THERE IS AN EXCELLENT SOLUTION-BUT WHICH VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE REALISED. HAVE YOU STOPPED TO CONSIDER ? How would school bills be met should you die ? When they do come along in the future will it mean a very difficult drain on your Income ? If you should die will your dependents have enough to live on reasonably, In the same way as they live now ? Again, when the mortgage or outstanding bills are paid, will there be enough to produce a sufficient income for your dependents on the probable yield of Gilt-Edged investments—and many other problems, for which we offer a solution herein.INSURANCE AS AN INVESTMENT Here are a few very interesting facts from many years' experience we know few of our clients realise. If you will just glance through them we feel sure you will see what a tremendous opportunity exists to-day FOR THOSE WHO CAN OBTAIN SOUND UNBIASSED ADVICE. An opportunity for saving money —Investing money—in fact, making money by profit, brought about by the extremely competitive market created by over a hundred Insurance Companies competing for business. First ofall, remember there are at least ONE HUNDRED first-class Insurance Companies in competition^ and to get the most benefit you should have the advantage of unbiassed expert advice We feel this fact must be obvious to everybody. For our own clientele we obtain this gratis and with pleasure. Let us send you further information concerning any or all the following ; A DO YOU REALISE that you can purchase your House by means of an Endowment Life Policy for any term (not exceeding 20 years) which provides relief from further payments in the event ofyour previous death ? Advances arranged up to 80 per cent, of the value of the property. Please state Age next birthday. Purchase Price of Property and Amount of Lean required. B DO YOU REALISE that Insurance to-day and for the future, with its modern develop ments is one of the few sound non-depreciating investments and comparable with first-class securities ? Almost every big Insurance Company offers schemes for investment—we can help you with advice with all these. ? C DO YOU REALISE that as a parent you can ensure the proper education of your child or children, whether you live or die ? This is far better than taking the gamble that when the time comes you will be still alive and will be able to meet school bills —- fortably from your income. Your child's chance in life can be assured. G /PDI70 * D DO YOU REALISE that parents can take out Life Assurance Policies for their children s lives at very low rates, and after 21 (without increase of premium) the insured can take them on ? Just consider what you would have saved in premiums if your parents had done this for you. E DO YOU REALISE that a married man can protect and provide for his wife or family (or even his own old age) and ensure an income sufficient to keep them without undue privation or disturbance in their mode of life should he die ? . . r ..r How many widows and children suddenly have to drop from a fair standard of life to absolutely penury and want, when there is no need for it if gradually provided against year by year by carefully thought out Insurance ? F DO YOU REALISE that unmarried men and women can assure, definitely, an income to live on in old age, come what may. Have you heard of the profit-sharing pension schemes . G DO YOU REALISE that by Insurance you can provide for the repayment of mortgages or loans when you die ? These liabilities may be a crushing calamity to those dependent on what you leave for them. Again, you can provide for the payment of Estate duties, thereby preserving your savings intact for your dependents, obviating forced sales of your securities or other effects. H DO YOU REALISE that if you wish to benefit the living, an Annuity for the life of one or more persons is the best way to get the largest possible income with absolute certainty from your capital ? How many people struggle to exist on income only from invested capital, whereas they would get far more from Annuities, with absolute certainty and absolute safety from fluctuation ? Insurance to-day Is a highly-specialised business. Only the expert can advise and only the unbiassed expert who has maintained a systematic up-to-date research in these matters. Ther. is no need for you to wade through 100 different prospectuses each containing a mu,ti P ,ic i^ ' Many of our cHents have profited by our Insurance Service. The ionger you leave insurance the larger the premiums and the cost to you becomes. F. P. BAKER. &amp; Co. Ltd. 2 UPPER JAMES ST..
