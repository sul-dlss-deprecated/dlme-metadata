Telegram, No. 79 C., dated the 25th January 1907. From—The Hon’ble Mr. A. L. P. Tucker, C.I.K., Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, Sibi, To The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. Your telegram of the 24th instant, S.—42. McConaghey reached Santsar on 4th January and is now probably at Hand close to Pishin. Bampur Governor early in January suggested to him transfer of meeting to Dizak. If Pishin meeting is impracticable, we can probably manage Dizak early although very inconvenient. If, however, Persians are undoubtedly covering (sic) meeting at either one place or other, then I see no alternative to accepting it in view of the great delay that must apparently ensue. If the Government of India should accept this view, then I think occasion may be taken to move Persian Government to take steps to control Persian-Baluchistan more parti cularly in connection with the Magas and Irafshan forts and the arms traffic, which is continuing on large scale. If these conditions continue, we shall be -justified in regard to next year’s meeting in requesting, 1st, that it may be held without fail, and 2nd, that our representative shall be attended by adequate armed escort.

H. Bill, First Assistant to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. Your telegram dated 22nd February. Charbar meeting. In the opinion of Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, separate meeting at Charbar is best for his claimants. If border meeting is held at Dizak, he does not believe any Chiefs of Coast Districts will go to Dizak. Telegram, No. S.—113, dated the 3rd March 1907. From—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Please refer to your telegram No. 105 of 26th February. Considering the great difficulty experienced in inducing Persians to hold a meeting at all this spring, even at Dizak, it seems highly improbable that they would consent to a second meeting being held at Charbar. Unless the Director’s claimants pro ceed to Dizak, the only alternative would seem to be the postponement of telegraph cases until next cold weather. Please let me know what the Direc tor’s views as to this are. Repeated to Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. Telegram, No. 213 C., dated the 2nd March 1907. From—The Hon'ble Mr. A. L. P.

McConaghey left Pasm 26th and is moving to Panjgur unless he receives further news at lurbat. As it is not likely that telegraph claims can he taken up at Dizak, the meeting there should be comparatively short in duration. Telegram, No. S.—116, dated the 5th March 1907.

He is asking Governor to fix early date for meeting at Isfandak, which is halfway between Dizak and Kuhak, and would meet both Nazim and himself. McConaghey expects further check as Persian New Year is close at hand, hut is making every effort to bring about meeting. I have approved his action. Telegram, No. 117, dated the 9th March 1907. From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta.

No. 372I-F. of 4th To Aia-es-Snitaneh, 14th January 1907 . December 1906, I have the honour to _ , ,, w , . transmit herewith a copy of a note which I have addressed to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the subject of last year s frontier meeting at Charbar and the awards given there. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, CECIL SPKJNG-RICE. The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. (Translation.) Sir C, Spring-Rice to Ala-es»Sultaneh. 14th January 1907. On July 30th last Your Highness’s successor in office addressed to Mr. Grant Duff a note in which he complained that the British officers attend ing the Charbar Meeting had taken to their camp and imprisoned certain Persian subjects. I have now received from the Government of India a full account of the proceedings of the meeting which enables me to supply Your Highness with the true facts of the incident which are as follows :— When the Persian representative, Saad-ed-Dowleh, arrived at the meeting, he had been unable to induce three Sardars of Persian Mekran to put in an appearance. The British representative volunteered to try to induce these men to come in to Charbar, an offer which Saad-ed-Dowleh gladly accepted. Saad-ed-Dowleh gave a written undertaking that the Sardars would be fairly treated if they came in, communication was opened with them and they came it with their attendants of their own accord on June 10th. No force was used, nor were the Chiefs subjected to any ill-treatment either in the British or the Persian camp. They left Charbar at the close of the meeting. In my note of I had the honour to urge that the Central Persian Government, should, through their local authorities, use every effort to secure the execution of the awards given at the frontier meeting. It will be evident to Your Highness that if this is not done, the whole labour and expense of these meetings is wasted, that feelings of discontent and disrespect for the decisions of the meeting are aroused on the frontier, and that these may lead to dangerous complications in so unsettled a district. I feel sure that any difficulties in these regions would be as unwelcome to the Persian Government as to His Majesty’s Government, and I therefore take this opportunity of once more pressing on the Persian Government the neces sity of facilitating, in every possible way, the execution of the awards given at the meeting. I have the honour to request that Your Highness will telegraph to the responsible local officials urging them to put these awards into execution without delay. G. I. CL P. O.—No. 5004 P.

Owin 0 * to these reasons and want of troops Governor states that he has been compelled to return to Bampur. Special messenger sent out by McConaghey confirmed departure of Governor from Hushak and also reported about 20 men including the Sartip, Persian army, were killed at Bakhshan. News from Bahu is that Mir Ahmad and Mir Ashraf are preparing to fight one another. Saiyid Khan is said to have sent 50 men to aid Mir Ahmad, and Nawab Khan of Jask is said to be helping Ashraf. McConaghey is despatchino-25 infantry to Santsar. The sudden return of Governor after reverse at Bakhshan and knowledge of Shah’s death may Mekran border. cause unrest all along the . Border meeting will be now impossible. I am instructing McConaghey to maintain as close observation of border as is practicable, and to telegraph any trustworthy news that may reach him, with such suggestions as he may wish to offer if there should be indications that disturbances are likely to affect our territory.

Please see correspondence regarding Perso-Baluch border cases sent with Foreign Secretary’s weekly letter dated 31st January last. Captain McConaghey telegraphs that the Governor of Bampur, who had started to meet him for the settlement of border cases, has been compelled to return to Bampur, owing to great unrest in Dizak due to intelligence of death of the Shah. There has been some fighting at Bakhshan Port, where Persian troops met with reverse, losing twenty men including the Sartip. Trouble is brewing at Bahu, and may spread all along Mekran border. Instructions have been sent to McConaghey to maintain as close observation of border as possible. Telegram, No. S.—139, dated the 17th March 1907. From—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta, To— Major P.

I ! information of the Government of India a copy of a report submitted by Captain P. McConaghey, Assistant Political Agent, Mekran, regarding Mir Ahmad Khan of Bahu’s recent visit to Ba.Inch Mekran. 2 . It will be seen that Kir Ahmad Khan was not permitted to collect any revenue on our side of the border and was turned back by Havildar Misri Khan, commanding the Mekran Levy Corps post at Santaar, whose action I have commended. I hope that this termination to Mir Ahmad Khan’s incursion will be regarded by the Government of India® 1 ^ India as sati3faoton r - 3* It ’will be noticed that Mir Ahmad Khan was accompanied on Ms trare^'ontl er incursion by 8 Persian Sarbaaos. It will be obcerred also from the Assistant Superintendent of the Jask Sub Division’s report to the Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs No. 46, dated December 4th 1S06, thdt Ms action was the outcome of arrangements concerted between him and Sardar 3«yid Kl an of Geh and the Banpur joint Deputy GcTsrnor, the Asa-vd-daula. These arrangements except in sc far as they may affect the border administration, afce not cur concern. In this cane however they did affoct it: the hcrcer wfs crossed and the peace of the country threatened by one of the Perso- Baluch tribal Chiefs wl o has previously given trouble and who was aocoiipanied by Persian soldiers. The matter has already been brought to the notice of the Persian Govern- merit aid no doubt the Government of India will take such further action on the information now supplied as nay be deemed advisable* The state of the country on the Persian side of the border has recently been acknowledged by tho Persian Government to be such that the postponement of the border meeting of the representatives of the two Governments which had been arranged for this month *» (January© (January 1907) at Pishin has besn proposed: it seems unlikely that it can he held this season. In what quarter precisely disturbances are threatened I haye not been informed. But I suggest that the present condition of Persian Baluchistan form a strong argument in support of the proposals which I have lately submitted to the Government of India for the increase of the Mekran Levy Corps in this part of the border and for the telegraph extension from Pasni to Turbat and Mand. In the meantime &amp; the acknowldged conditions of Perso-Baluchistan and the circumstances of this incident seem to me render it desirable that it should be recognised that we have a precedent for sending a small armed force across the border in case of emergency. 4. I would express the hope that, on the information now supplied, the Government of India will agree with me that there has been no breach of his instructions by the Mekran Kazim and that there is no occasion to call upon him for any explanation. Both the Mekran llizarjiat authorities and the Lory Corps appear to haYe co-operated successfully and done all that was needed. The informa tion from Task transmitted under my telegram Ho. 1022, dated December 14th 1906, has proved to be incorrect: news that reaches Jask from the interior must generally needo nead Tarificatlon I should mention, perhaps, that the orders of December, 1904, antedate the establishment of the Mekran Levy Corps and that in the event of a failure to act up to them the Hazim, in ordinary course, could hardly be 1 eld to be solely responsible. However there has fortunately been no such failure. I should mention also that I myself on this occasion modified those instructions (my telegram Ho. 989 of December 5th) for reasons which appear to be cogent, namely that at the time it was by no means certain that the instructions of 1904 could be acted up to on the spot, while the application made by Mir Ahmad at Jask and the desire of the Resident at Bushire that he should not be made hostile to the Indo-Buropean Telegraph Department in future, were new factors in the situation. I am anxious that no impression unfavourable to Mir Mehrulla Khan should arise from this incident: he has done much good work fdr us and as a matter of fact was on leave from Mekran when the incident occurred.

Tucker, Offg: Agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan.&lt;£) l S' Copy of a lotter Ho* 10-C, dated the 13th January 1907, from the Assistant Political Agent, Mekran, to the Political Agent, Kalat. In continuation of correspondence ending with your telegram No. 3-V, regarding Mir Ahmad Khan's recent action in crossing the border, I hare the honour to forward the following report:- 2. About the end of October, Hayildar Misri Khan, commanding the post at Sant ear, was informed that a few families (10 to 15) had come to Gabd from Bahu. The and HaYildar proceeded to Gabd to make enquiries Ake found that Eaoda Abdoo of Gabd was willing to stand security for the good behaviour of these men. About the middle of November, the Havildar having received news that Mir Ahmad was coming to Gabd, started off with 15 men. TT e halted at Gabd for 3 days and then returned to Santsar. A few days later the Havildar, again receiving news from Gabd, once more proceeded there. On the 5th or 6th day of his halt, news was brought in that Mir Ahmad was making for Domeli, to which place the Havildar then marched. On ^ his arrival at Domeli, he found that Mir Ahmad Khan had arrived the same morning at Zahran (close to Domeli). At0 Uo At the same time a Uaik with 5 men (leaving only 3 men at ' ^ the post) also arrived at Domeli from Santsar. 3. The Havildeir received a letter from Mir Ahmad o Khan saying that he had only come over to collect revenue from his subjects, who had fled to Domeli, etc. The ^ ■ r] ill | i ; Havildar asked Mir Ahmad to come over to Domeli, which he did next morning. The same day Mir Ghazi Khan (Naib of Tump) with two of his sowars arrived at Domeli from Tui^p. Mir Ahmad was then given the option of returning quietly to Bahu or of fighting. The Sardar chose the former alternative and left next morning. A close watch was kept on his movements and news was soon brought in that the Sardar was making for Kurmi near Gabd. Mir Ghazi Khan and party marched in that direction at once. Finally Note. Two of these are well known: Khoda I Mir Ahmad and party retired Sandag and Sohrab Khan (Bamris of Bampur). to Bahu. Mir Ahmad Khan*s party consisted of about 20 men, 8 of whom were Persian Sarbazes (Sowars). 4. Owing to rumours that Sardar Said Khan, who was with the Asadud Dowleh at Chilisar in Bahu (about 30 miles west of Gabd), intended to assist Mir Ahmad, Mir Ghazi Khan, Davildar Misri Khan and his party remained at Gabd. In the meantime I was gradually bringing up the strength of thee i? t e Santsar peat to €0 men. I am glad to report that thje year all Mir Ahmad’ a attempts either to extract i ©venue or to loot on our side of the border hare proved futile. Ho harm has baan done except that my men at Santsar have been kept on the run for the last two months. I have received the usual letters from the Persian Note . The Asadod Bowleh with his large camp was in Dashtiari or Bahu the whole time and quite close by. In addition Mir Ahmad had 6 Persian Sarba&amp;es flith him. authorities saying that they were unaware of Mir Ahmad*s movements, etc., and also from Mir Ahmad protesting that he was only carrying out the wishes of his own Governor, etc. 5. On my recent tour to Santsar, Kalato, etc., I have Interviewed the leading hea.Amen of these refugees. About 150 families have come over this year and the following tribes are represented:- (1) Hots, (2) Jadgals, (5) Lathis, (4) Gorgichs. I also saw Mir Aahraf of Bahu at Kaiato, who had been to Owadar. Mir Ashraf is returning in a few days time to Bahu and the Lathis and Gorgichs (oO families) will pro bably ft-ccompany him. I am inclined to think thao some of the Hots and Jadgals will also return. I am preparing further report on the question of these refugees and will send the &amp;^me in as soon as possible(Copy) yrom ITo. 0 J 1 , v i The Under Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department * To The Hon»ble Mr- A. !• P.

Bushire reports Mir Ahmad Khan (of) Bahu, under pressure (of) Persian authorities for immediate payment (of) revenues, requests permission to cross the frontier into Dasht in order to collect legitimate revenues from his tribesmen who have fled there. It is reported that if permission be not given he will enter without. I am asking Bushire if this is known to Persian Government, and if they endorse his request. In view of the correspondence ending with my letter of the 19th December 3904, No. 6442,* request should be refused, but I think that in circumstances it may be given, as long as Sardar acts in subordinate communication with Mekran authorities and refrains from any act(s) of violence.

My telegram of the 1st instant, No. 972. Following telegram received from Bushire ‘.-^Begins. Persian Government doubtless know nothing of Ahmad Khan’s request or circumstances. In view of the fact that instead of raiding as anticipated he took the trouble to proceed to Jask to explain position to Assistant Superintendent and preferred deferential personal request, I should be glad to have your reply before moving central authorities against him through British Minister at Tehran, the only practical effect of which would probably be to make Ahmed Khan hostile to Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment in future. Should you intimate to me that you cannot concur in his crossing border for the purpose stated under any conditions, I will ask Governor- General, Kerman, to do his best to stop him. Ends. My point is that if permission be given as I recommended, it must be at instance or with knowledge of Persian Government. Otherwise precedent is of no value. My ad interim instructions to Mekran are that if Ahmad Khan crosses the frontier, he should be warned that orders of Government are being obtained regarding him, and he must obey them when received, and meanwhile strictly refrain from any forcible action.

Action of Nazim’s sepoys in permitting Ahmad Khan to collect taxes in Baluch Mekran is a flagrant breach of orders passed by Major Bamsay two years ago. See his letter Rentier No. 6442 of T 9th December 1904 to Foreign Department. Unless you see NoTeV-ss. 0&gt; objection Nazim should be called upon for explanation. It would seem to be desirable that the Nazim should be clearly informed that in all matters affect ing, or likely to affect, the border he should report to the Assistant Political Agent and take his orders. Telegram No. S.-199, dated the 2.5th December 1906. From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department Calcutta, 55 To— Sir C. Spring-Rice, K.C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. S.-199. A report has been received from the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan that Ahmad Khan of Balm recently crossed Baluch Mekran border in order to collect revenue due to him from his tribesmen who had fled beyond Persian limits. It is believed that Ahmad Khan was acting under orders of Governor of Bampur, as the latter was with him shortly before he crossed the frontier. Orders were issued by the Government of India that Ahmad Khan should be refused permission to enter Baluch Mekran, and that if he disobeyed, he should be required to recross the border. The orders were too late, and Ahmad Khan after attaining his object returned to Persian territory, where he is said to have shot two of these men. If the Persian Government disavow responsibility Ahmad Khan can be treated as a free-booter in future, if he re-enters Baluch Mekran ; if the action of Ahmad Khan was with the previous knowledge or at the instance of the Persian Government, it affords precedent for our similarly crossing frontier in emergency. Will you kindly bring the matter to notice of the Persian Government, and let us know the result. &amp; No. 3994-F., dated Fort William, the 28th December 1906 (Confidential).

As regards Kalat-Mekran cases, the instructions by which the Nazim of Mekran is at present guided are as. follows:— u With regard to affairs on the border it is desirable that the chief direction of these should be in the. Assistant Political Agent’s hands. You will, as heretofore, deal direct with all minor cases between your people and their neighbours across the Persian border, but in all important cases you should, as far as feasible, refer to the Assistant Political Agent before taking action. Also all your correspondence with myself (the Political Agent in Kalat) on border matters should in future pass through the Assistant Political Agent’s hands. That is, yon will submit your reports to the Political Agent through the Assistant Political Agent. Further, it will be well if all correspondence and dealings with high Persian officials, such as the Governor- General of Kerman, with the Consul at Kerman, with the Belgian Customs officials and with Russians or other Europeans be conducted directly by the Assistant Political Agent.” These instructions were issued, in July 1905, by Major Showers, with my tentative approval and were recently re-affirmed by myself in personal confer ence with the Political Agent, the Assistant Political Agent and the Nazim, special attention being called to that portion which makes it incumbent on the Nazim to refer to the Assistant Political Agent in all important border cases before taking action. They were framed with considerable care and with due regard to the principle f laid down by the Government of India that t the Nazim’s authority is in no way to be superseded. To this principle, in my J opinion, great importance is to be attached. The instructions appear to me to give the Assistant Political Agent a full control of the administration of border affairs, and I do not think that they require modification. The words as far as feasible” represent what is really the practical difficulty. When4 Captain McConaghey is absent on deputation or tours of inspection, rapid communication between him and the Nazim is not possible. The telegraph extension to Panjgur should, however, have much improved matters in this respect, while the further proposed telegraph extension from Pasni to Turbat and from Turbat to Hand should minimise possible misunderstandings.

A good deal of correspondence has subsequently passed regarding the procedure to be observed at these border meetings and the holding of the meeting for 1906. The meeting in this year has now taken place in June and July and I have the honour to enclose a copy of report No. 552-V., dated September 16, 1906, from Major K. A. E. Benn, C.I.E., Political Agent in Kalat, reviewing the account of the meeting furnished by Captain E. McConaghey, the Assistant Political Agent in Mekran, who acted as our principal representative. I enclose a copy of Captain McConaghey’s report No. 86, dated August 16,1908. The enclosures to the report which are voluminous I do not forward, as the reports under submission would appear to furnish an adequate history of the meeting and of the work done at it. 2. The meeting was attended on our side by Captain McCouaghey ; the Nazim of Mekran ; and four of the principal Mekran Sirdars. On the Persian side the Itilla&gt;ud*Daula, lately Karguzar of Mohammerah, represented the Persian Government and with him the Saad-ud-Daula (Murtaza Kuli Khan) until recently Deputy Governor or Sartip of Bampur. With these two officials were also four of the Sirdars of Persian Mekran, the principal of whom is Sirdar Said Khan of Geh, who is considered to be the principal Sirdar and is styled the Nazim of Persian Mekran. 3. The proceedings of the meeting were delayed by the receipt of orders, by the Saad-ud-Daula on June 15 to the effect that he had been relieved of his appointment in Bampur. This difficulty was in a measure got over by his appointment a few days later as a Special Mamur or delegate for the purpose of the meeting. Eurther delay was caused by the absence from the meeting of the Bahu and Dashtiari Sirdars, whose attendance was only obtained through the friendly offices of Captain McConaghey, given at the definite request and with the formal acquiescence of the Persian representatives.^ As the manner of the arrival of these Sirdars at Charbar has formed the subject of a communication from the Persian Government, 1 would invite special attention to paragraph 5 of Captain McConaghey’s report in which the facts are stated. Captain McConaghey’s action, which was due to a desire to assist the represent atives of the Persian Government and was welcomed, by them, appears to me to be an action that merits appreciation and may, I suggest, with advantage be placed in a proper light before the Government of Persia. The absence of the Sirdars in question, who were in no way ill-treated, would have been very disadvantageous and their attendance appears to me to be a matter for con gratulation on both sides. 4 . The following is a summary of the work done at the meeting :— 70 cases were placed before the representatives. These were claims brought by residents of Kalat, Mekran, relating chiefly to cattle thefts and compensation for murder. Awards amounting in ail to Its. 16,233 were given in 29 cases : 30 cases were dismissed and the bearing of 11 was postponed till the next meeting which has been fixed for January next, at Pishin. A report on the claims by British Indian subjects in Persian Mekran has been supplied to the Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs, who was represented by Mr. McMeekin, the clerk in charge of the Charbar 1'elegraph Station, of whose work Captain McConaghey speaks well. The oases dealt with number 113. This report will, no doubt, come before the Government of India through the Bushire Besideney. 5. Over and above their proceedings regarding individual cases the meeting has arrived at the following special agreements : U\ An award in the special case of the raid committed by Mir Ahmad Khan, Sirdar of Bahu, across the British Border in connection 1 C330EDwith which 156 camels were claimed. The award directs the restitution of 58 camels. (5) An agreement under which the blood money claimable as com pensation is fixed at Rs. d,000 in the case of Motabirs and Rs. 1,500 in the case of common people. (c) An agreement to facilitate the hearing of claims postponed until the next meeting at Pishin. (d) An agreement that the Saadmd-Daula, the Persian representative , will do his best within the ensuing six months to give effect to the awards of this and previous meetings. (e) An agreement that in six given cases the Saad-ud-Daula will do his best before the next Peshin settlement to give effect to the awards, which are of some years standing and for which he is responsible. (/') An agreement that in regard to the frontier forts of Magas and Irafshan the demolition of the former and the occupation of the latter by Persian troops, in accordance with the previous agree ment made with the Governor of Kirman, should be carried out before the next meeting by the officer of the Persian Government entrusted with the settlement of the frontier. 6. The arrangements concluded at the agreement of 1905, regarding the appearance of claimants at Bampur and the prohibition of British subjects from lending money and selling to Persian subjects, which are referred to at the close of paragraph 3 of letter from the Government of India, No. 3386-F., dated September 26, 1905, the last of which was a matter that should have been reopened at the meeting and further discussed, would appear to have escaped notice. The due action will be taken at the next meeting. 7. Captain McConaghey in paragraph 7 of his report draws attention to the unsatisfactory position regarding the awards in connection with the Kuntdar raid against Mir Shah Jahan Kurd of Magas and Mir Jiand Khan, Damani. This raid was carried out in December, 1900, and the awards will be found in Appendices L and M to Major Shower's printed Report, Part II, which forms an enclosure to my predecessor’s letter No. 400-C., dated June 17, 1902. It was agreed or arranged in the various agreements of Pebruary 1902 that the Magas Port should not be rebuilt without the permission of the Persian authorities and that the Irafshan Port should be occupied by Persian troops who would not be withdrawn without a reference by the Government of Persia to that of India. These arrangements have not been effective as the Magas Chief has rebuilt his fort and the Irafshan Port has not been garrisoned. However, under the agreement of the recent meeting which I have summarised the officer who will be deputed by the Persian Government to settle the fron tier affairs of Baluchistan at the next meeting six months later is to be made responsible for carrying out the agreement regarding these forts so that the question may not cause further complaints from the British representatives at the next meeting and that the agreement made between the two Governments may be carried out. ©. inns at me recent meeting a good deal of rough and ready work has been got through of a kind that is suited to this remote and inhospitable portion of the bord.er over which on the Persian side the officials of the Government have-not succeeded in establishing a firm and continuous control. Eyerv meeting however marks the attainment of a further stage in the slow but steadv progress that is being made towards better Government and more settled administration. The next meeting is to take place, under arrangements locallv agreed to m January next which is not now distant. The local officers on Path sides have agreed to steps which seem likely to make the next meetin- more useful, to accelerate progress in the settlement of old awards and to brin^ n«w cases under joint tribal arbitration. The important Magas and Irafshan Pnr+ questions have been taken up in the manner which I'have described Thl 2action that seems called for on our part will perhaps he the intimation to the Persian Government that the holding of the meeting in January next at Pishin has been locally agreed to : that we are ready to accept that date and are instructing representatives on our part to attend the meeting accordingly : and that it is hoped that the Persian Government will issue corresponding instructions which will ensure its adequate representation at the time and place agreed to. On our part I think that Captain P. McConaghey, the Assistant Political Agent in Mekran and the Nazim of Mekran, Mir Mehrulla Khan, Kaisani, C.I.E., may be nominated as representatives at the next meeting, and they should he attended by a suitable following of Mekran Sirdars and tribal representatives. The next meeting over and above outstanding awards and new claims will, by local agreement, deal with the important pending questions of the rebuilding of the fort at Magas and the occupation of that at Irafshan by Persian troops under the understanding of (902. 9. The recent meeting took place at a particularly trying time of the year and there was a good deal of delay before the arrangements for its assembly were complete. Good work was done at the meeting by Captain McConaghey and also by Mir Mehrulla Khan, the Nazim, of ^ whom Captain McConaghey speaks highly. I have much pleasure in bringing Captain McConaghey*s name again to the favourable notice of the Government of India and in placing on record my appreciation of the good service rendered by Mir Mehr ulla Khan and of the Mekran Sirdars with him, in particular Sirdar Mehrab Khan, Gitchki.

An English translation of the agreements taken in the following eases. ^ &lt;rh e am0 unt of compensation to be paid in future as blood money. (J) Disposal of new cases, (c) Recovery of awards. 2. The date fixed for the meeting was in April 1906 ; hut owing to delays the •nroceediuss did not commence until 23rd June. They terminated on 24 h July 1906. I statement in tabular form is attached showing that 46 cases were disposed of by Captain McConaghey and 20 cases by the Nazim of Mekran after Captain McConaghey had left Charbar. 3. It will he observed that while the number and nature of the awards are sntisfactorv their execution by the Local Persian authorities appears to be a mattefo^nTiderable difficulty. The result is that hut little real safasfaction is obtained for British subjects. This is no doubt due to the failure of the Persian Government to recognise their responsibility with regard to the engage ments entered into by their representatives on the spot. The general apat ly displayed by the Persian authorities in conuection with these proceedings is exemplified by their inability to secure the attendance of the Sarawan Sardars4 m whose presence was essential, while the fact that awards to the extent of &amp;s. 50,000 still remain to he recovered, furnishes sufficient proof of the helpless nature of the administrative machinery in Persian Baluchistan. In this connection I would invite a reference to the concluding portion of paragraph 3 of Captain McConaghey’s report and paragraph 7 of the agree ment at enclosure Y. The statement that “ the procedure generally adopted by the Persian Government with regard to these meetings is to dismiss the 'Deputy Governor as soon as the proceedings are ended ” is scarcely indicative of a sincere desire on their part to co-operate with us, nor, I venture to think, does it warrant the assumption that the Persian Government are taking these meetings very seriously. The Government of India in their letter No. 33£6 of 26th Sep tember 1905 to your address have concurred in your views regarding the responsibility attaching to the new Governor of a Province for the engagements entered into by his predecessor and I venture to think that good grounds now exist for a reference to the Persian Government on this subject. But a Deputy Governor, however willing he might be to assist us, would probably find it impossible to execute an award unless adequately supported by the Central Government. 4. In paragraphs 5 and 9 it is explained how the Bahu and Dashtiari Chiefs were induced to attend the meeting. In this connection I would invite a reference to your confidential telegrams Nos. 609 of 8th August and 613 of the 10th August to my address. It will be seen that no arrest or imprisonment of any Persian Sardars took place. 5. In paragraph 10 of his report the Assistant Political Agent discusses the great inconvenience and expense suffered by British subjects in bringing forward and proving their claims at these meetings and I would venture to ask that Captain McConaghey’s proposals may receive your favourable consider ation. 6. In paragraphs 13 to 16 the Assistant Political Agent brings forward for favourable notice the names of the Nazim of Mekran, Sardar Mehrab Khan Gitchki and other Sardars as well as those of certain officials and I would beg to endorse the recommendations he has made. 7. The meeting which was conducted by Captain McConaghey with much tact and patience during the hottest month of the year may, I think, be con sidered a success and its results satisfactorv. With your approval I will inform Captain McConaghey to this effect. 8. The next meeting is fixed for 17th January 1907 at Peshin. No. 86, dated Panjgur, the 16th August 1906. From— Captain F.

I have the honour to submit my report together with the enclosures men tioned in the margin show ing the results of the recent Charbar meeting. The claimants belonged to the following two classes :— 1. British Indian sub jects residing on the Mekran Coast. 2. Kalat-Mekran sub jects. f'l5 British representatives. 1. Captain E. McConaghey, Assistant Political Agent, Mekran. 2. Sardar Meh.ru.llah Khan, C.I.E., Nazim of Mekran. 3. Sardar Sheikh Omar Khan, Gitchki of Kej. 4. Sardar Mehrab Khan, Gitchki of Kej. 5. Sardar Nadir Shah, Gitchki of Tump. 6. Mir Abdul Karim Khan, Gitchki of Kalatuk. Bersian Representatives. 1. Itila-ud-Douleh, Karguzar of the Persian Government. 2. Sad-ud-Dowleh, Special Mamoor appointed for the meeting. 3. Sardar Said Khan, Chief of Persian Mekran. 4. Mir Ahmad Khan, Sardar of Bahu. 5. Mir Abdi Khan, Sardar of Dashtyari. 6. Mir Mahmood Khan of Dashtyari. 2. The date originally fixed for the meeting at Peshin was the 1st Jan uary 3906. A change was afterwards made, the meeting was postponed till April and Charbar was chosen owing to the lateness of the year as the most suitable place for all parties. I arrived at Charbar on the 15th of April in order to enquire into the illicit traffic of arms along the Persian Mekran Coast. On the completion of my enquiry, I returned to Charbar on the 31st May. Mir Mehrullah Khan, C.I.E., the Nazim of Mekran, accompanied by the Kej Sardars, arrived in Charbar on the 6th of May. The Itila-ud-Douleh arrived from Bushire on the 7th June and finally the Saad-ud-Douleh, the Deputy Governor of Persian Baluchistan, on the 13th of June. 3. After the usual ceremonial visits had been paid, the date fixed for the commencement of the proceedings was the j6th of June. On the 15th June, the Saad-ud-Douleh informed me that he had been deprived of the Governor ship of Persian Baluchistan and that he intended leaving Charbar on the next day. This was extremely disappointing as during my enquiry into the arms traffic, I had been brought constantly in touch with Murtaza Kuli Khan, I had formed hopes that it might be possible to recover a greater portion of our awards and also to come to a settlement regarding the case of Mir Ahmad Khan and of the murder of Abdullah, a British Indian trader. Einally after a few days’ delay, the Saad-ud-Douleh was appointed a special Mamoor to hear and decide all the claims of the meeting in co-operation with the Itila-ud Douleh and the British Bepresentatives. The procedure generally adopted by the Persian Government with regard to these meetings is to dismiss the Deputy Governor as soon as the proceedings are ended. This year owing to delays, the dismissal came at the commencement of the proceedings. Owing to this dismissal the greater portion of the troops with Murtaza Kuli Khan immediate ly returned to Bumpur and the authority of the Special Mamoor sank to a vanishing point. 4. It was agreed that throughout the meeting, the morning sittings should be held in our camp and the evening ones iu the Persian camp. This very soon resolved itself into our having always to go to their camp as the Persians were extremely reluctant to face the heat. At the last meeting, owing to the fore thought of the Nazim in procuring a written agreement to the effect that, in the absence of the defendants oases would be heard &lt;?#-parte, nearly all our cases were able to be brought before the meeting and awards given. The Itilamd-Douleh fought hard for two days against this procedure, but un fortunately for himself his own seal was attached to his agreement.5. The Saad-ud-Douleli brought uith him to Cliarbar only the Chiefs and Mutabirs mentioned in the margin. The Sarawan Sardars had previously refused to attend or to pay up their instalments of revenue. Shortly after his arrival in Charbar, the Saad-ud-Douleh received strict orders from Kirman to procure the Mir Ahmed Khan of Bahu. attendance at Charbar of all the Sardars, 1. Sardar Said Khan of Geh. 2. Mir Ashraf Klian of Bahu. 3 Mir Sharif Khan of Payak in Sib. 4. Mir Ibrahim Khan of Sib. 2. MirAbdi Khan of Dashtyari. 3. Mir Mahmood Khan of Dasbtyari. etc., required by the British Represent atives. As the Saad-ud-Douleh was unable to persuade the three Sardars of Persian M ‘kran mentioned in the margin whose presences were required, to attend, I volunteered in a friendly manner to try and use my influence to induce these Sardars to come in to Charbar. The Siad-ud-Douleh was only too grateful for this assistance and readily agreed to give me a written assurance to the effect that these Sardars would be fairly treated if they came iu. At the last year’s meeting two of these Chiefs had been put into chains and the third refused to attend. I also discussed the whole question with the Itila-ud-Douleh. As soon as I had received this written assurance, I authorised the Nazim to send Sardar Mehrab Khan with three or four of hiA own men to try and persuade these Chiefs to come in and to have their cases heard, Sardar Mehrab Khan was the bearer of letters from the Itila- ud-Douleh, the Nazim and myself. These Chiefs with their attendants came in of their own accord on the 10th June. No force was used nor were these Chiefs subjected to any ill-treatment cither in the Persian camp or in ours, flhese Chiefs left Charbar at the termination of the meeting. 6. The meeting opened on the 23rd of June. In all 70 Kalati Mekran cases were heard with the following results: 29 cases for claims amounting to R,s. 26,500 were proved and awards to the value of Its. 16,233 were given. 30 cases for claims amounting to Its. 8,200 were dismissed. 11 cases for claims amounting to Us. 1,300 odd were postponed for hear* ing at the next meeting. In addition 8 new cases for claims amounting to Its. 1,500 approximately were brought on the list of cases to be heard at the next meeting. 7. As,the Sarawan Sardars had refused to attend the meeting, the instalments due up to date on account of the Kuntdar raid could not be recovered. The awards now amount to Its. 10,700 Mir Shah Jahan.

All recent information tends to show that this Chief is still engaged in keeping up communication with Muh* also steadily refuses to pay n a 8 ‘u At tbe meetl ^o held at Peshin in January 1903, a few eases were set tied and awards to the value nf Rc q non J vy, a cases were set- these awards have been paid. ’ dd ^ glVei1 ' U P to date none o£ f^eUhaUhc rameL , com P li cate(l one owing to the fact that the camels when raided were i„ n m P Icate &lt;l °? e 0Wln S to theiact that the owners from Bahu in Persian Mekran n N' iciugoes have been pleased if the Persian authorities'could ha/e etpSle“te attenZceof this chief at the rncoting 'without any interference of any hind from our side. We had proofs that the Persian Governor even if he did not actually order the raid passively encouiaged the same. It was only when we recognised that the Persian authorities could neither persuade this Chief nor compel him ' by force to attend the meeting that I volunteered on the strong advice of the Nazim to assist the Saad-ud-Dou’eh in a friendly manner to persuade this Chief to come in and have his case heard. Mir Ahmad Khan shortly after the raid handed back 123 camels. Our people claimed 156 more. Mir Ahmad was prepared to swear that the number was only 50. Our proofs as to the exact number were not strong. Finally we agreed with the consent of all parties to compromise the case for 50 camels, twenty camels to be given to the Telegraph employes whose claim was for 28 and 30 to the other claimants. The Bahu 8 ardars are poor. I think I was able to impress on Mir Ahmad that in future it would not pay him to commit other raids. He also recognised the fact that it was only owing to greatest luck that he escaped being captured by my post at Suntsar. I was glad to have the opportunity of personally meeting this S irdar, as Bahu stretches all along our border from Mand to Jowni. 10. It was extremely difficult to get the Persian representatives to come to any agreement with a view to the recovery of our awards since 1902 or even to fix a date for the next meeting, vis., 17th January 1907. They were very averse to take any responsibility and were fearful of the consequences. I am afraid unless the Persian Government can be induced to support strongly Saad-ud-Douleh, their representative, within the next few months with a view to the recovery of these awards, then our claimants (both British Indian and Kalati-Mekran subjects) will have to wait in vain. Tlie non-recovery of these awards and the total la'k of power to punish offenders are likely to cause trouble, especially as the inhabitants on both sides of the border are wild and undisciplined. Only last year, the trouble caused by Mir Bahram * Bind ’ was partly due to the non-recovery of his award given at the Peshin meeting of 1 ;03. Our claimants have to incur expense and also to suffer many inconveniences before they are able to prove their claims. It is extremely hard on them for neither do they receive the compensation awarded to them at the meetings nor are they permitted to retaliate in the manner they would like to according to their old customs. 11. Sardar Said Khan of Geh and Kasarkand attended the meeting but had to leave early owing to the receipt of a letter from tlie new Governor of Persian Baluchistan. For the last few years the Governors have invariably given this Sardar the Nazimship of Persian Mekran. He is of pure Baluch descent and closely allied to most of the Sardars in Persian Mekran, such as Mir Mahmood Khan of Dashtyari and Mir Aslam Khan of Bint. His rival is Mir Mohim Khan of Lashar and he has also an enemy in Mir Nawab Khan Bamri. His recent quarrel with Kamal Khan, an influential Baluch, appears to have been ill- advised. The quarrel lias now developed into a blood feud owing to the fact that one of the Sardar’s relatives was killed in the fighting, which took place at Shighim: This Sardar is well disposed to us and his influence in Persian Mekran is undoubtedly great. 12. With the Bs. 750 placed at my disposal, at the request of the Itila- ud-Douleb, I was able to pay off a loan of Bs. 600 odd taken by him at Bushire. This sum was advanced by the bank at the request of the Besidency so as to enable the Kurguzar to proceed to Charbar. In addition to the balance I gave the Itila-ud-Douleh a sum of Bs. 500 in cash. On the whole the Itila- ud-Douleh’s attitude w as friendly. Before his departure for Charbar, he had been posted to Seistan as Karguzar. His one object and aim at first w r as to prolong the meeting so as to avoid faking up this oppointment. Later on when he was appointed Karguzar of Kirman the situation became easier. The relations between the Itila-ud-Douleh and the S.iad-ud-Douleh were almost throughout the meeting of a strained character. The Karguzar met wdth little success in bis attempts to squeeze the Saad-ud-Douleh and the Sardars of Persian Baluchistan. This greatly perturbed him. I naturally stood aloof from all these quarrels but they did not tend to make matters easier. 7•He would have, I think, if he had been allowed Saad-lld'Douleh MlU’taza Kllli Khan our awards . 6 assUted 1,1 the recovei y of was a pleasant man to meet. He did his in a most difficult position.* Ho resides in Bam and therefore is well acquainted with the manners of the country and appears to be generally liked by his own Sardars, etc. ^ 13. Mir Mehrullah Khan, C.I.E., Nazim of Mekran has now attended UTm IF mi . addltl0 “ meeting held between Major Showers and a-ul-Mulk. This year the Nazim was detained for three months in Charbar but throughout the whole time lie was most cheerful. The long and well deserving services of Mir Mehrullah Khan in Mekran are well known but I would hke to add that at tins meeting he showed the same skill, energy and cases of tl^lri'L^TV 0t ° nl f• se , tttem0 ^ 3 of his own cases but also 'of the vnn Jin 1 - Ind,nn subjects residing on the Mekran Coast. I trust you will bring bis services to the favourable notice of the local Government.

These four districts (Dashtyari, Bahu, Geh and Kasarkand) are the only ones with which I have direct relations; their present state is satisfactory, while as regards new claims now raised, which are to be heard at the next meet ing, though a considerable number have been raised against the Geh District and a few also against Dashtyari, Bahu and Kasarkand, they are mostly unimport ant and for small amounts. 4^ With regard to Captain McConaghey’s paragraph 3, the arrangements made in 1905 for the recovery of claims against outlying districts as Surbaz Dizak, Bampur, Lashar, Pishin, etc., proved ineffective. These cases were taken up again at the meeting this year and the awards given are shown in Captain McConaghey’s lists. They are all the proved cases in the list of 65 cases Against Kasarkand:-Nos. 21 , 23 , 32 , 36 , 40 , 44 , these noted in the margin ' ' which it is believed can be settled locally. The awards given for the remaining cases in this list must be settled through the authorities at Kerman, and I would sug gest that the list with its vernacular copy be sent to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul there for this purpose. All the awards in the list of 48 cases will, it is hoped, be settled locally. 53 . 54 . 55 and 56 . Against Geh:—Nos. 22 , 24 , 29 , 30 , 39 , 41 and 42 . Against Dashtyari.—No. 47 . Against Bahu : —Nos. 48 and 64 . 5. Captain McConaghey’s paragraphs 4 and 5 The claims against the three former Governors of Persian Baluchistan, namely, Hashim Khan Wali Khan and Shahzada Zahir-us-Sultan, as well as the claim for the murder of Abdulla, son of Abdoo, a British Indian subject, must also be settled through the authorities at Kerman, and for this purpose Persian Agreements for each case with English translations, are now sent for transmission to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Kerman. All these cases are already on record at Kerman, the cases against the former Governors should be pressed as strongly as possible and the case about the murder of Abdulla should on no account be lost sight of. I am myself, as suggested by Captain McConaghey, sending a copy of the Agreement in this case to Mir Mohim Khan of Lashar. 6. The list of 58 new cases, and a list of 9 cases postponed for enquiry at the next meeting, are sent in English and Persian, These lists should be sent to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Kerman for transmission to the Deputy Governor of Bampur as suggested by Captain McConaghey in paragraph 7 of his report. r &amp; r / 7. Captain McConaghey’s paragraph 8 A copy of the agreement for the recovery of the awards is sent in Persian and English.

With reference to the claims enumerated in paragraph 2 of your letter No. 193-P., dated the 7th July 1905, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, I would report as follows :— ( 1 ) Dashtyari District. (a) The claims against Mir Mahmud Khan have been paid up in full. (b) Advantage was taken of Mir Abdi Khan’s presence at the meeting to settle the following number of cases against him and the people of Dashtyari. In all 39 cases were heard. 18 cases were proved and awards to the amount of Rs. 1,500 approximately were given. 15 cases were dismissed and 6 cases were postponed for the next meeting. (c) The claim for Rs. 2,500 against Nur Muhammad and Sheikh Muha- mad, Dashtyari subjects, was recovered in full by Mr. McMeekin. ( 2 ) Bahu District. The claim against Mir Ashraf Khan of Bahu was a difficult one to settle. This Chief, as you are well aware, has neither money nor property. Mir Ashraf has been kept in detention for the last year by the Governor of Persian Baluchis tan at Bampur. A further detention, l consider, would have been useless. This man, although weak, is well disposed and has done good service. Moreover these debts were incurred by his father and the same have now been reduced by him to some extent. Mir Ashraf Khan willingly gave the following agreement, viz., that he would pay Rs. 600 per annum, or in default his telegraph subsidy of Rs. 600 per annum, or any such sum as you might consider advisable should be kept to pay off his creditors till the completion of the liquidation of his debts. ( 3 ). Geh District. Sardar Said Khan has considerably reduced his original debt and has now only two creditors, viz. — Rs. Tursiamal Assumal ... ... ... 1,100 Uttumal ... ... ...

( 4 ). Kaiarkand District. The claims against Mir Jan Muhammad of Kasarkand have been paid up in full. The deputation of Mulla Moosa last year to Bampur proved futile. V 1 ad ‘ me pu dition, the Karguzar’s Munshi died at with reference to paragraph 4. Bampur. These cases together with seve ral others were taken up at this meeting. The total number of cases heard was 113 , 6 9 cases were proved and awards to the value of Rs. 7,47* were given. 34 cases for claims amounting to Rs. 7,288 were dismissed. 10 cases for claims amounting to Rs. 2,157 were postponed for the next meeting. 4 The claims against the following e*.Governors of Persian Baluchistan have been proved. I would suggest that active steps should be taken for the recovery of these awards. These debts are far from creditable, as in every in stance they were incurred whilst the men were acting as the representatives of the Persian Government. ... Rs. Hashim Khan,* Satwat-ul-Mamalik ... 3 )^° Wall Khan ... ... ••• Shahzada, Zahir-us-Sultan ... ••• 2, 7 00 _ x 5. With reference to the case of the murder of Abdulla, son of Abdoo, a British Indian subject, I would recommend that this case should not be lost sight of and that every effort should be made to recover the award at the next meet ing. This man was one of the party who accompanied Mullah Moosa last year to Bampur. The murder appears to have been committed solely for loot. Our traders and subjects will have little security if this case is allowed to drop. I would also suggest, so as to give Mir Mohim Khan no loophole for escape, that a copy of this agreement should be sent to him by Mr. McMeekin by the hand of a trustworthy messenger. 6. In the recent raid made by Mir Ahmad Khan of Bahu, the Telegraph employes claimed to have lost 28 camels. The case was compromised with the consent of both parties for 20 camels. According to the terms of the agreement 10 camels are to be handed in at the next meeting in January next and the re mainder six months after the meeting. 7. 58 new cases have been brought on the list for disposal at the next meet ing to be held in January next. I would suggest that not later than the 1st Octo ber a complete list of these claims, etc., should be sent to the Deputy Governor of Persian Baluchistan. This ought to give the Governor ample time to warn the Sardars and their people. This is important as the Governors are in the habit of stating that their predecessors never handed oyer to them any agreement, etc., settled at the previous meetings. 8. With regard to the agreement for the recovery of all the awards of the cases settled up to date, I am addressing the Political Agent, Kaiat, as the agreement is applicable to both the Kalati Mekran cases and your own. I would like to point out that more than half of your claims were for property destroyed or looted by the Per sian subjects of Persian Baluchistan. To prove their claims our traders have not only to bear considerable expenses but also have to undergo many inconveni- ences. At the present time the authority of the Persian Governors in Persian * This man &gt;s ( I believe, now acting as the Deputy Governor of Bam.Baluchistan is practically speaking non-existent. Unless the Persian Government can be induced to support strongly Sadud Dowleh, their representative, with a view to recover these awards, then l am afraid that there will be no hope for our traders at the next meeting to be held in January 1907. i trust in your capacity as the Political Officer in charge of Mekran Coast, you will report the matter to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 9. I should like to bring to your notice the good work done by Mr. McMee- kin, your representative in Charbar. On his shoulders fell the burden of working up the cases, many of which were of many years standing. After my departure Mr. McMeekin was able to bring about a settlement of 49 cases, including that of Nur Muhammad’s, which was most creditable. In his dealings with the traders and British Indian subjects, and also with the local Sardars and the people of Persian Mekran, Mr. McMeekin always acted with the greatest tact. His personal influence with the people is good. I trust you will bring his good work in this connection to the favourable notice of the Resident in the Persian Gulf. 10. To sum «/&gt;.— All your cases, I think, have now been brought up to date. (a) The awards of 69 cases to the value of Rs. 7,471 have to be recovered. (£) The awards against the three Persian ex-Governors of Persian Baluchis tan amounting to Rs. 7,560 also have to be recovered. (c) The following awards against the under mentioned Sardars of Persian Mekran have still to be recovered:— Sardar Said Khan of Geh ... ... ... Rs. 1,880 Mir Ahmad Khan of Bahu ... ... ... 20 camels. Mir Ashraf Khan of Bahu ... ... Exact amount not known as the agree ment is with Mr. McMeekin. (^) The case of the murder of Abdulla, son of Abdoo, has been postponed for final decision at the next meeting. (e) 10 old cases and 58 new cases have been brought on the list to be heard at the next meeting. (f) The date fixed for the next meeting to be held at Pishin is 17th January 1907. 11. A copy of this report, with translations of the agreements, etc., has been forwarded to the Political Agent, Kalat, for information.33'' No, 2316 , dated Bushire, the 30 th September (received 8 th October) 1906 . From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— Sir Louis W. Dane, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. . I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department letter No. 2495-F., to my address, dated 6th August 1906, on the subject of the Frontier Meetings which for the last few years have been held annually for the investigation and settlement of Anglo-Persian claims ; and with reference to paragraph 2 of that communication beg to state that a copy of Foreign Department letter No. 37 i 3 -F*» with accompaniments, was duly for warded to the Kerman Consulate on 29th October 1904. 2 . Sufficient time has not elapsed for me to have received a reply from , . _ , Colonel Stewart relative to the Government Kerman 0.137, ate t e 22n ugus 190, of India’s last communication, but his letter marginally noted, written on receipt of Foreign Department letter No. i8i4-F., has now reached me, and in submitting a copy of it for information, I beg to offer the following observations. 3. When the Government of India in 1904 expressed the desire* that the •Foreign Department letter No. 3713 p* 2 9 t h date and place for the ensuing meeting September 1904. (then contemplated for the settlement of Kalat-Kerman cases only) should be arranged by our representatives at Kerman and Kalat in direct communication, they no doubt did so with the idea of simplifying and accelerating the preliminary negociations ; but the course thus contemplated was rendered impracticable owing to the deputation by the Shah’s Government of a special and non-local official for the purpose of watching proceedings on behalf of the Persian Foreign Office. The communication of the details of this official’s deputation and movements through His Majesty’s Legation seems to be an ordinary course for the Tehran Authorities to have pursued, and as long as that practice continues the proposal made in paragraph 3 of Colonel Stewart’s letter now enclosed, would not appear to be feasible. In fact, in following the procedure referred to, the Persian Government merely acted in accordance with previous precedent in regard to what I may term as the “ Telegraph ” Meetings. In the latter connection the deputation of a “ Mamur ” or special officer to meet the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, or his represen tative has always been the custom, and as it was found that when the appoint ment of this “ Mamur ” was left to the Governor-General of Kerman some unsuitable petty official was invariably sent, it became necessary for the Resi dency to apply to the Central Government every year through His Majesty’s Legation for the deputation of a man of adequate status and capability for the purpose. When the meeting became a combined one the Central Government followed the same procedure. 4. There now seem to be three alternative courses for the Government of India to consider— (I) That the Annual Meeting should continue to be a combined one for the settlement of both Kalat and Telegraph cases, on the same lines as the last two. Such combined meetings should always take place at Charbar or some analogous place accessible to the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, or his Deputy; and the Persian Government should, as hitherto, appoint a suitable “ Mamur ” in communication with His Majesty’s Legation. In this connection I would invite reference to my letter No. 553, dated 18th November 1905, to the Government of India. (II) That the meetings should be again separated, and that the arrange ment for the investigation of Perso-Baluch border cases should be arranged locally between our representatives at Kalat and Kerman, without troubling the Persian Government or His Majesty’s Legation.2 Any meeting so arranged should take place at some place in the interior, and not at Charbar or elsewhere within the sphere of the Director of Telegraphs who would have to arrange for his own meeting at Charbar through the Residency and His Majesty’s Legation as heretofore. m That the frontier meeting in its present form should be abolished altogether and that the Assistant Political Agent, Panjgur, or other selected officer, should be deputed each cold weather to travel in Mekran, and that the Director of Telegraphs and the Nazim should send their respective cases to him for disposal during his * Assistant Political Agent, Mekran, to Political tOUt, as Suggested in Captain McCon« Agent, Kaiat, No. 17 -C. p., dated 15 th June ic,os. aghey’s report* marginally cited. This proposal seems to differ little from one made by Colonel Stewart of which the t Paragraph 5 of enclosure to letter from Re- Go\ ernment of India are already incident- •ident to Foreign Department No. 2 x 03 , dated ally aware.'j* 9 th September 1906 . In this connection I note that the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor- General in Baluchistan in his letter No. 645, dated 17th August 1906, to the Government of India writes that Captain McConaghey “ suggests that also cases from the Per so-Baluchistan littoral for settlement at the Border Meeting might with advantage be placed before the Meeting by him ; ” but as worded in his report of 15th June Captain McConaghey's suggestion reads to me as contemplating the abolition altogether of the meeting as at present constituted j and Colonel Stewart at Kerman arrives at the same conclusions on slightly different premises. The Kaiat meeting however is a question which the Government of India will no doubt consider in communication with the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. 5. Looking at the matter from the point of view of the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, I am inclined to think that failing a decision to continue the present combined meetings, the maintenance of the time-honoured arrangement under which every year he or his deputy has met a Persian representative at Charbar will probably suit him best, as being of a more regular and permanent nature than the tours of a special officer in Mekran are likely to prove. At the same time he would no doubt be glad of any assistance which the latter could give to his cases while on tour, by pressing various Mirs for the payment of sums due by them. r J 6. I am sending Mr. Whitby Smith a copy of this communication for an expression of his views on this point and I will put Government in possession of them as soon as they reach me.

With reference to paragraph 2 of the Foreign Department letter No. 1814-F., dated the 13th June 1906, I had not been shown the correspondence in question and was consequently unaware of the arrangements previously made for the Charbar Meeting. I would point out, however, that the instructions conveyed in paragraph 5 of the Foreign Department letter No. 3713-F., dated the 29th September 1904, would appear to have referred to the arrangements to be made for “ the ensuing winter ” ; it was not stated that the procedure was to be of general application in the future. In the letter also of Foreign Department No. 1814-F., above referred to it states that the meetings should be arranged “ through ” the Consul at Kerman, but it is not clear how far he is intended to act on his own initiative. I should also explain that in reply to enquiries made by me from the Legation, Mr. Grant Duff informed me by telegram in February last that he would telegraph to me when the matter (t.e., the arrangement of the meeting) had been definitely arranged. 3. I would suggest that if the meeting is to be held in future all details of date, place, etc., might conveniently be arranged by the British Consul in communication with the Political Agent, Kalat, the Government of India deput ing their representative when informed on these points.■■MM ' —' ( No. 2353, dated Bushire, the 7th October 1906.

Cox., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, With reference to your letter N0. 2317 of the 30th September 1906, I have the honour to say that I am entirely in agreement with your views as stated in paragraph 5 of your letter No. 2316 of the same date to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. A combined meeting at Charbar on the same lines as the last two meetings is very convenient to me and also to the claimants in the cases which come before me, but if such meetings are to be discontinued, then it would suit me best to have a separate meeting at Charbar. 2. I recognise, however, that as in the past it may also in the future be a matter of difficulty to arrange for such separate meetings. There were such meetings in 1899 and 1900, but the results were small owing to the incapacity of the Persian officials sent. From 1901 to I 9°3 inclusive there were no meetings, and the first really effctive meeting, during recent years, was held in 1904 when Wali Khan, Deputy Governor of Bampur, and Ali Khan, Persian Mamur, represented the Persian Government and Mr. Campbell of this Department was my representative. In 1905 it was contemplated to again hold a similar meeting at Charbar but instead a combined meeting was held there for the settlement of both Kalat and telegraph cases. This was the first combined meeting, and I believe the main reason why such a meeting was held at all arose from the fact that the Persian Government was unable to arrange in one year for two meetings, both of which demanded the presence of the Deputy Governor of Bampur. 3 . If I am right in the above conjecture, then the first of the three alter native cases mentioned in paragraph 4 of your letter No. 2316 suggests itself to me as the most suitable, but 1 come to this conclusion solely from my own point of view and with some diffidence, as I am not aware to what extent the last two combined meetings have been statisfactory or the reverse in reference to Kalat cases.

So far as regards the number and nature of the cases disposed of at the last meeting, the Government of India consider the result to be satisfactory but the difficulty which remains to be overcome is the execution by the local Persian authorities of the awards agreed to by the joint representatives From the correspondence forwarded, it will be seen that the Saad-ud-Do wlah specially agreed that he would do his best before the next meetin* to give effect to the awards of the last and previous meetings. But however willin 01 a Deputy Governor may be to assist, there is no doubt that it would lie impossible for him to execute the awards unless he were adequately supported by the Central Government. In my telegram of the 15th August 1906, Mr. Grant Duff was asked to move the Persian Government to see that the awards already made should be given effect to, and I am now to ask you to be good enough to press this point, and to request the Persian Government to give the necessary support to the Saad-ud-Daulah. 3.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Clarke’s letter No. 3719, dated the 4th instant, regarding the Charbar border meetino* of June 1906. 2. With reference to paragraph 5 of that letter I have the honour to state that I quite agree with the Government of India that the continuance of the present system of combined meetings is desirable. Subject to such recon sideration as the circumstances of British and Persian Mekran may demand a year hence, I think that Charbar, or some other place equally convenient to the Telegraph Department, may be agreed to as the locality where the 1908 meeting may be held. Before, however, a definite intimation is made to this effect, it will probably be well to await the results of the Pishia meeting next month. I should mention that I have not proposed the abandonment of these meetings, combined or otherwise. The impression that the abandonment of the meetings have been a matter under consideration appears to rest on passages in Captain McConaghey’s letter, No. 17 C.-P., dated the 15th June 1906, which gives an account of his special deputation to Persian Mekran last winter in connection with the illicit traffic in arms. Captain McConaghey certainly recommended that he shonld be sent on similar deputation again this winter, and that the Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs should send him his border cases for settlement. But by the insertion of the words “ settlement at the border meeting” in my covering report No. 645, dated 17th August 1906, I intended to make it clear that I did not advocate the abandonment of the Border meetings and the substitution for them of an arrangement under wffiich the Assistant Political Agent in Mekran would tour in Persian Mekran with some regularity and while on tour carry out practically Consular duties in respect of claims against Perso-Baluchistan made by British Indian subjects on the Perso-Mekran littoral. Clearly before an arrangement of this kind could be considered, the assent of the Persian Government would be required thereto, while I infer from the absence of instructions on my reeemmendation that Captain McConaghey might be allowed this winter to carry out a second tour in Perso-Baluchistan in connection with the arms traffic, that the assent of the Persian Government to a repetition of the tour will not be readily forthcoming.r i 1 27 T should be 'lad if Captain McConaghey were permitted to make a second tour, hut beyond that I do not go and think that the abandonment of the border meetings, which are a fairly settled arrangement, would be a mistake. If the Government of India should be pleased to regard favourably the proposals which I have recently submitted for increasing the strength of the Mekran Levy Corps and adding to its posts, the Assistant Political _ Agent and Commandant of the Corps wdll have quite as much before him as he can efficiently get through in the next twn years, and an extension of the scope of his duties is, I think, to be deprecated. 3 . This last conclusion represents, as far as the Perso-Mekran littoral is concerned, my views on the point noticed in paragraph 6 of the letter to which I am replying. As regards Kalat-Mekran cases, the instructions by which the Nazim of Mekren is at present guided are as follows:— “ With regard to affairs on the border it is desirable that the chief direc tion of these should be in the Assistant Political Agent’s hands. You will as heretofore deal direct w ith all minor cases between your people and their neighbours across the Persian border, but in all important cases you should, as far as feasible, refer to the Assistant Political Agent before taking action. Also all your correspondence with myself (the Political Agent in Kalat) on border ^matters should in future pass through the Assistant Political Agent’s hands. That is, you u ill submit your reports to the Political Agent through the Assistant Political Aijent. Further it will be well if all correspondence and dealings with high Persian officials, such as the Governor-General of Kerman, with the Consul at Kerman, with the Belgian Customs officials and w r ith Russians or other Luropeans be conducted directly by the Assistant Political Agent”. These instructions were issued in July 1905, by Major Showers with my tentative approval and were recently reaffirmed by myself in personal con ference with the Political Agent, the Assistant Political Agent, and the Nazim, special attention being called to that portion which makes it incumbent on the Nazim to refer to the Assistant Political Agent in all important border cases before taking action. They were framed with considerable care and . _ , 1Qn , XT , c co with due regard to the principle* laid down by the Government of India that the Nazim’s authority is in no way to be superseded. To this principle, in my opinion, great importance is to be attached. The instructions appear to me to give the Assistant Political Agent a full control of the administration of border affairs, and I do not think that they require modification. The words “ as far as feasible ” represent wffiat is really the practical difficulty. When Captain McConaghey is absent on deputation or tours of inspection, rapid communication between him and the Nazim is not possible. The telegraph extension lo Panjgur should however have much improved matters in this repect while the further proposed telegraph extension from Pasni to Turbat and from Turbat to Maud should minimise possible misunderstandings. i \[Confidential.'] No. 2935, dated Bushire, the 15th (received 27th) December 1906.

With reference to correspondence ending with Foreign Department letter No. 87-F., dated 11th January 1906, on the subject of the Perso-Baluch Frontier Meetings, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the , „ . « c .. T j 'ri Government of India, a copy of a Director, Persian Gulf Section, Indo-European . .. , . i . -. r Telegraph Department, to the Political Resident communication addressed to me by Air. in the Presian Gdf, No. 68 -P., dated 24th Whitby-Smith, which somewhat amplifies February 1906 . the explanations furnished in my letter No. 553, dated 18th November 1905. 2 . The question of presents recommended for different personages attend ing the meeting has been disposed of with tho exception of that recommended for the Ittila-ed-Dowleh ; in regard to which I await the further communi cation from the Government of India alluded to in paragraph 3 of the Deputy Secretary’s letter No. 4161-F., dated 14th December 1905. No. 68 -P dated the 24th February 1906. From—H. Whitby Smith Esq., Director, Persian Gulf Section, Indo-European Telegraph Department, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, With reference to the correspondence ending with your No. 40 of the 7th Januarv 1906,1 have the honour to submit the following remarks, as the reasons for the presence of Mr. Pinsent, Clerk in Charge, Charbar, at the meeting held at Charbar in April and May last, and the connection of this Department with the oases then investigated do not appear to be clearly understood either by the Government of India in the Foreign Department, or by the Hon Die the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. 2. In the first place, I would observe that it is well understood that the Director of this Department has no connection whatever with the border meetings. The fact that the claims in which the Director in his political capacitv is interested, were represented at all last year before the bor er meeting held at Charbar was the result of an arrangement made between Major Sykes, then Consul at Kerman, and the Political Agent, Kalat. s y are aware the majority of cases had already been investigated at Charhar before Mr. Campbell of this Department andthe ? ” they and as their settlement rested in the mam with the Persian Authorities y were sent to Major Sykes at Kerman for completion. During 1904, however, no settlements were arrived at at Kerman, and consequently when aresmgements were made for the border meeting in 1905, it appeared to M^or Sykes that th» of which he had previous know edge, “f . 1 ™ an y way attempted to first to disclaim the idea that he went beyond this or may y F put himself before the Nazim. In this connection I “^ bere say ^ report Mr. Pinsent submitted consisted merely of an explan y s ^n short paragraphs, and that the numerous attached to U; were not productions of his own, hut agreements and decisions mau jUN 2 /&gt; Nazim in consultation with the Persian Officials (as is apparent from the Nazim’s report) and simply handed over by him to Mr. Pinsent for onward transmission to me. 3. In the second place, I beg to point out that it is a mistake to describe the claims sent by me to the Nazdm as “ Telegraph Claims.” Major Showers in his letter No. 77T-V of the 27th October 1905 to the Honourable the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan refers to them as “ Telegraph Claims against Persian subjects ”v ail d the Honourable the Agent to the Governor- General in Baluchistan in his No. 5612 of the 13th November 1905 to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, writes with reference to them as follows i—*'The telegraph claims are not restricted to claims incidental to transactions within the limits of the telegraph stations, but cover dealings by telegraph employes outside these limits, and hence the list of cases settled has assumed great length and the cases are not classified. The Mekran cases not connected with the Telegraph Department are those 25 in number of which, a list was received and submitted with my letter No. 1097-Z., dated August 23rd, 1905.” With reference to these statements I would explain that not a single one of all the cases submitted by me to the Nazim had anything whatever to do with the Telegraph Department or any of its employes. They were every one of them cases of claims of British Indian subjects against Persian subjects, such as come before the Director in his political capacity as an assistant of yours for Persian littoral affairs, ( a capa city which was recognised by the Government of India in the Poreign Depart ment in letter No.&lt;'27^2-E., of the 7th October, 18S4totbe Political Besidentin the Persian Gulf). Sixteen of these cases ( i.e^ Nos. 7 to 22 inclusive) are in cluded in the list of 25 referred to “as Mekran Cases’ in the extract from the letter No. 5612, of the Honourable the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan quoted above. 4. I see that the Honourable the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan has arranged to give presents to the Nazim of Mekran and Sardar Mehrab Khan, corresponding with those recommended by the Officiat ing Director in his No. 235-P., of the 2nd August 1905, to your address. The services of Mr, Pinsent, Munshi Jhanda Khan, and vernacular letter writer Mulla Mussa for work done outside the scope of their ordinary duties, are equally deserving of recognition, and I trust that after this explanation it will be conceded that they also should get presents as recommended, and that such ^presents should be .given not by the Indo-European Telegraph Department but by the Political Department. 5. I hope it will also be conceded that Mr. Pinsent’s presence at the meet ing at Charbar was not only desirable but necessary; also that the attitude taken up by him at the meeting was correct. In some cases when his presence was not apparently necessary, he wished to absent himself but the Zahir-es- Sultan invariably insisted upon his being present. G. I. C. P. 0.—No. 5250 F. 64—C. L.

You will observe from the letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 425, dated the 3rd September 1905, a copy of which was forwarded to you with Mr. Clarke’s letter No. 3386-F., dated the 26th Septem ber 1905, that Major Cox and Sir A. Hardinge recommended the grant of a cash present of Rs. 750, equivalent to 300 tomans, to the Itela-ed-Dowleh, Kargnzar of Mohammerah, who attended the meeting on the part of the Persian Government, and rendered valuable assistance in bringing about a satisfactory settlement of the claims. As it was considered that the cost of any presents that might be given in connection with the meeting should be borne by the Baluchistan Agency Toshakhana or Secret Service grants, the decision with regard to the grant of this reward was left inter alia to you. 3 In your reply No. 5612, dated the 13th November 1905, you stated ^that you had no funds at your disposal from which you could make the presentation recommended for Mr. Pinsent, the clerk in charge of the Charbar Telegraph Station, and you expressed the opinion that this presentation was not one which you were called upon to make. You made no reference to the proposed reward for the Karguzar, hut it seems probable that you meant the same remark to apply to it. 4. I am now to say that, on further consideration, the Government of India have decided to bear the charge for the proposed present to the Karguzar from their Toshakhana grant. The Karguzar as you have been informed in my telegram No. S04-E., dated the 6 th February 1906, has again been deputed to settle frontier questions at the border meeting in April next, and I am to request that Captain McConaghey, Assistant Political Agent for Mekran, ma^ be authorised at his discretion to pay to the Itela-ed-Dowleh a cash present of Rs. 750 either before or after the next border meeting, as may appear desirable, and that the amount may be debited in your accounts to the Government of India Toshakhana. 5. I take this opportunity of forwarding for your information a copy of * Letter No. sol, dated the 4 th March 1906, and a further communication^ which has been enclosure. received from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the subject of the border meetings. The position to be held by the representative of the Indo-European Telegraph Department at future meetings is clearly indicated in Mr. Clarke’s letter No. 4163-F., dated the I4th December 1905, and the Government of India see no advantage in discussing the question further.No. 987-F., dated Fott William, the 22nd Marcli 1906.

He said that the presence at the Oharbar meeting last year of the Karguzar of Mohammerah was useless, owing to his ignorance of the country. The Karguzar has mentioned 3,000 tomans as an approximate estimate of his travelling expenses in the event of his being required to proceed to Kuhak to attend the meeting. • **«•** No. 1459-F., dated Simla, the 10th May 1906.

Stewaet, I.A., His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Kermau, To—The Assistant Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to inform you that some unnecessary expense has been incurred at the present time by this Consulate in telegraphing to Tehran for certain information required by the Governor-General of Kerman and Persian Baluchistan in connection with the approaching meeting at Charbar for the determination of cases arising on the Perso-Baluch border. 2. I have informed the Acting Governor that in future it will he more convenient for him to obtain this information himself in communication with the Persian authorities at Tehran, as the British Consul is not entrusted with the arrangements for the meeting; but I would suggest the Consul being kept informed of the arrangements in future so far as may be convenient or possible, in case the local authorities in Kerman experience at any time a similar difficulty in obtaining the requisite information.

Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, on the sub ject of the annual meeting between the Nazim of Mekran and the Deputy Governor of Bampur for the settlement of border disputes.6 mm • Vide your letter No. 270, dated the 20th August 1904 ; paragraph 2 of the letter from the Govern ment of India in the Foreign Department, No. S713-F., dated the 28th September 1904; and letter from the Bon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, No. 2075-Z., dated the 20th August 1904. 2. Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart states that the British Consul is not en trusted with the arrangements for the meeting, and he suggests that the Consul he kept informed of the arrangements in future. As you are aware*, it was decided two years ago that the annual meetings between the Deputy Governor of Bampur and the Nazim of Mekran should be arranged through the Consul at Kerman, and the Political Agent, Kalat, was authorised to correspond direct with the Consul, and to keep him informed on all matters affecting the Persian border. It is not clear from Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart’s letter wkether he is unaware of these arrangements, or whether his remark is to be read as a complaint that the present year’s meeting was not arranged through the Kerman Consulate. If the latter is intended, the matter should in the first place be brought to the notice of the Political Agent, Kalat, and I am to request that_Lieutenant^ Colonel Stewart may be informed accordingly. 3. Apart from the authority given to the Consul at Kerman to correspond directly with the Political Agent, Kalat, on border affairs, the regular channel f for any communications which he desires to address to the Government of India on political matters connected with the Per sian Gulf or the Baluchistan frontier, is through the Political Besident at Bushire, and I am to request that Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart’s attention may be drawn to this circumstance. There seems to be nothing in the present reference to justify a departure from the usual routine. 4.

Captain McConaghey and the Nazim of Makran, with our Sardars and claimants, are there but the Sardars on the Persian side, who are generally the defendants, have not come. The proceedings are at a standstill, as the Deputy Governor of Bampur has informed our representative that he has been relieved of his post by the Governor-General of Kerman and can do nothing towards securing a settlement of the claims or undertake the responsibility of payment there under or for a new agreement. Last year a similar position arose when the Zahir-us-Sultan was dismissed immediately after the meeting and the settlements that were made turned out to he largely useless. These changes of officials are calculated to make the labours of delegates abortive, and we would suggest a strong protest being made to the Persian Government who might be urged at once to arrange for a duly empowered representative to settle the claims and effect a new agreement bindiu 0, on the local authorities or on the Governor-General of Kerman. It is very desirable that there should be no further delay in concluding business. Repeated to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, Lieutenant- Colonel Stewart.

In continuation of the correspondence ending with Mr. Clarke’s endorse* ment No. 2214-E., dated the I7th June 1905, I have the honour to submit for the information of the Government of India, the enclosed copy of letter No. 394*V.C, dated the 15th August 1905, with enclosures, from the Political Agent in Kalat, reporting on the recent meeting on the Perso-Baluch border between the Nazim of Mekran and the Deputy Governor of Bampur. 2 . I am in general agreement with the observations made by Major Showers regarding the conduct of, and the measures taken at, the meeting. I would however invite attention to the sixth paragraph of the report, which states that the Zahir-us.Sultan has. been succeeded in the Bampur Deputy Governorship by Murtaza Kuli Khan. It was understood from the Persian Gulf diary lor the week ending the 28th May 1905, of which a copy was received under the endorsement already quoted, that the Zahir-us*Su]tan had been continued in the Deputy Governorship for another year. Major Showers to whom I referred on the point on the receipt of his report, informs me that the report that the Zahir-us-Sultan has been succeeded is now confirmed. We are, I think, entitled to consider that the Deputy Governor is responsible for the engagements made by his predecessor. If the contrary should prove to be the case there will be ground for a reference to the Persian Government. &lt;S 53 j 3. It will be noticed that the next meeting will be held in January next, and that the Assistant Political Agent, Mekran, will attend it. 4.

Tucker, I.C.S , C I.E., Officiating Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan. I have the honour to refer to corresj^ondence ending with yonr Second Assistant’s endorsement No. 568-V. of the 30th May 1905, on the subject of the annual meeting on the Perso-Baluch border between the Nazim of Mekran and the Deputy Governor of Bampur, arranged for by the Governor-General of Kir- man and myself in 1902. 2. Last year there was no meeting, but in the present year the meeting was duly held at Charbar between the 3rd April and 9th May 1905. British and Kalat interests were represented by Mir Mehrulla Khan, C.I.E., Nazim of Mekran, while on the Persian side there were the Zahir-us*Sultan, Deputy Governor of Bampur, and the Eateleh-ud-Dowleh, Karguzar of Mohammerah. 3. The full list of the Sirdars and officials attending the meeting is as- follows :— Persian Representatives. 1. Shahzada Zahir-us-Sultan, Deputy Governor, Bampur. 2. Eateleh-ud-Dowleh, Karguzar, Mohammerah. 3 . Nawab Wala Muhammad Nizam, Abdul Samad. 4 . Rifat-ul-Mumalik, Mamur, Kirman Government. 5 . Sirdar Said Khan, Chief of Persian Baluchistan. British and Kalat Representatives,* ]. Mr. Fred Pinsent, Clerk in charge Charhar. 2 . Mir Mebrulla Khan, C.I E., Nazim of Mekran.. 3 . Sirdar Sheik Umar Khan, Gichki of Kej. 4 Sirdar Mehrab Khan, Gichki of Kej. 5. Sirdar Nadir Shah, Gichki of Tump.2 4 . As you are aware, there was some correspondence last year in whic /’ 1 the Kirman authorities sought to show that the present Nazim of Mekran is not a person of suitable rank to meet tlie Zahir“us-feiiltan, and a leanest was made that a British officer should he deputed for the purpose. This contention was not accepted by Government. However, as, on the formation of the Mekran Levy Corps, a British officer in the person of the Assistant Political Agent, Mekran, happened to be in the country at the date of the meeting, an endeavour was made to depute the Assistant Political Agent to Charbar along with the Nazim; but the arrangement fell through owing, partly, to the expense in volved in conveying the party by the S.S. “ and partly, as the proposal having been taken up somewhat late, the Assistant Political A°-ent could hardly have reached Charbar before the proceedings terminated. Thus the Nazim proceeded alone. 5 . A considerable number of cases or questions were dealt with at the meeting. Of these, 25 cases have been embodied in a tabular statement compiled in my °office from the Nazim’s report, and a copy of the statement is forwarded herewith for information. It will be seen that all these cases refer to claims preferred by British subjects against Persian subjects. The settlements come to may be considered satisfactory in that the Deputy Governor has been held personally responsible to see that all outstanding sums of compensation are made good at an early date. This arrangement includes the instalments due from the Damanis and Mir Shall Jehan, Kurd, of Magas in connection with the Kuntdar raid. 6 I must draw attention, however, to the fact of the Zahir-us-Sulfan’s having been replaced in the Deputy Governorship of Bampur by Murtza Kuli Khan, and to the Nazim’s fear that the former’s removal might mean the non-fulfilment of the arrangement made by him, vide my telegram No. 49-V.C. of 5th April 1905. It would be as well, perhaps, in these circumstances, jf a reference were made to the Persian Government, with a view to the new Deputy Governor’s liability to carry out the official engagements made by his predecessor being impressed on the Kirman authorities. 7 . The following are certain other matters dealt with during the meeting:— (i) Regarding the importation of fire-arms into Persia from Maskat. The Karguzar in reply to a reference from the Nazim stated that he was taking steps to suppress the traffic, and that the British authorities should co-operate in the matter by prohibiting the export of these arms from Maskat. A translation of this reply is attached. (ii) The Nazim drew the Karguzar’s attentton to the fact that the Magas fort had been rebuilt by Shah Jehan, Kurd, contrary to the agreement come to between the Governor-General of Kirman and Major Showers. In reply the Karguzar said he was reporting in the matter to higher authority, and that a further communica^ tion would be made to the Nazim later on. (iii) A similar reply was received to the Nazim’s protest against the handing over of the Irafshan fort to Azam Khan, Bazazai, con trary to the settlement come to. M ith regard to these two questions it appears from the correspondence forwarded to me under your Pirst Assistant’s endorsement No. 775-Z. of the *lst duly 1905, that necessary orders have been issued by the Persian Govern ment. the Nazim is being asked to report what effect is given to the orders in question. (iv) 1 he Balm and other Persian Sirdars have been crossing the border and interfering lately with persons who have sought refuge in British territory, ffhe Nazim asked that they should be restrained from such action and the Karguzar replied, as before, that he had referred to the Persian Poreign Secretary, and that a further communication would follow.(y) There have been complaints for some time past by the Jewni fisher man against the Gwefter officials, who subject the fishermen to yaiious exactions, and put difficulties in the way of their trade in the Gwetfer Bay. On the Nazim’s reference to him the Karguzar wrote to say he had directed the Gwetter officials to leave the fishermen alone. 8 . To facilitate the settlement of cases, certain arrangements were come to between the Nazim and the Persian officials present at the meeting. These* are as follows:— («) That all persons having claims against the people of Persian Baluchis tan and Persian Mekran, should present themselves before the Deputy Governor of Bampur within two months of receipt of a summons from him to so appear. The latter will then decide the case in the presence of the parties and of representa tives of the Nazim, the Karguzar of Kirman and the Direc tor, Persian Gulf Telegraphs. Cases not settled in this way will be taken up at the next meeting at Pishin. The Nazim presumably had good reasons for acceding to this proposal. The anangement however is one that is likely to cause British claimants considerable inconvenience and, unless for the strongest reasons, the Nazim (and the Assistant Political Agent if present) will be instructed not to again accept a similar proposal. The Persian officials who are always informed in good time of the claims to be brought forward at each approaching meeting, should arrange to bring the defendants with them, so that cases could'be disposed of before the meetings terminate. {wj If a party to a case should die leaving no heir the case shall be dismissed. Also if a defendant in a suit should leave one country and pass into the other, the Governor of the former should inform that of the latter country of the fact. It will then be the duty of that Governor in whose territory the said defendant is for the time being, either to expel him from such territory, or to secure his attendance before the next forthcoming meetins: (Hi) That with a view to preventing the multiplication of claims between the people of the two countries, British subjects will be prohibited from ( 1 ) lending money to Persian subjects, ( 2 ) from selling them anything except for cash, or in exchange for some thing else or until some suitable article has been given in pledge, except with the permission of the Karguzar or other frontier official. No claim founded on a transaction which took place in contravention of this rule will be recognized. This seems a somewhat one-sided rule. There are many relations and transac tions between the border peoples of the two countries, and injustice is likely to be done to British subjects in barring their suits in a class of case that must very frequently arise. To say the least of it the arrangement should be reciprocal. The Assistant Political Agent and the Nazim will be instructed to reopen and further discuss the question at the next meeting and for the present to consider the introduction of the rule as quite tentative. 9. On the whole the meeting may be said to have been satisfactory in its results. New claims by British subjects have been admitted, and old ones have been affirmed, and promises for the early payment of instalments made by responsible officials. The Persian Government are evidently taking the meeting seriously, and this being so, we have the best possible guarantee fort he maintenance of the peace of the border. 30. It has been arranged that the next meeting will take place at Pishin in January next.Translation of a Murasila No. 399, dated 29th Safar 1323A. ft., corresponding to 5th May 1, $£, from the Eateleh-ud-Dowleh Mirza Hussain Khan, Karguzar of Mohammerah, to Mir Mehrulla Khan, C.I.E., Nazim of Mekran.

Dashtyari District.—The, claims against the Chiefs of this District Mirs Abdi Khan and Mahmud Khan, amounting to Rs. 7,934, 14 Camels, 2 Cows, and 1 Donkey,2 and for which bonds were passed by them at the meeting held at Charbar in the month of April 1904, have been paid up in full. Mir Mahmud Khan’s son was taken as surety for payment of these claims/^ and kept in the custody of Sardar Said Khan pending full payment. As this has been done, I have written to the Governor of Baluchistan and Sardar Said Khan that Mir Mahmud’s son can be released. There still remain claims amounting to Rs. 1,976-4-0, and 2 camels, against Mir Abdi Khan, for which British Indian traders hold his bonds ; but as he was not present at Charbar, during the meeting, they have been deferred for enquiry and settlement to the meeting promised, or agreed to, by the Persian authorities to be held at Pishin in January 1906. Claims also amounting to Rs. 657-8-0, 4 bullocks, 1 Camel, 1 Donkey, 8 Cows, and 2 Goats, against various people of the Dashtyari district remain unsettled, as defendants were not present at Charbar. These have also been deferred for settlement to the meeting at Pishin in January 1906 . A claim for Rs. 2 , 500 , for which a bond was given by Mirs Mahmud Khan and Abdi Khan at the meeting held at Charbar in April 1904 , was again gone into, and settlement made, that the amount should be paid by Noor Muhammad, brother of Sheikh Muhammad (a headman of the Dashtyari district), whose two grandsons were taken as sureties by the Governor until full settlement of the claim was made. This claim it is expected will be settled very shortly. Besides the above, there is a claim of one camel against Mir Mahmud Khan, who has agreed to settle the matter in six months from date of agreement. Baku District .—Claims against Mir Ashraf Khan, joint Chief of this dis trict, amounting to Rs. 8,384, and for which bonds were passed by him at the meeting held at Charbar in April 1904, remain as before, except that he has paid Rs. 476, leaving a balance of Rs. 7,908 due by him. As this Chief is very poor I am afraid it will be some considerable time before he can pay up. His son has been taken by the Governor as surety until full settlement is made. Claims against Mir Ahmad Khan, joint Chief with Mir Ashraf Khan of the Bahu district, amounting to Rs. 210, 24 Sheep, 1 Camel, 5 Cows, and ^ share of buffalo, and for which bonds were passed by him at the meeting at Charbar in Anril 1904^ have been settled by giving him two months’ time to pay up His son also has beep taken as surety by the Governor until settlement is made. It is expected this Chief will pay up all claims shortly. cxpeciea Gaih /^^/nc/.—The claims against the Chief of this district Sardar Said Khan, amounting to Rs. 8,071, and for which bonds were Dassed , bv him at thp meeting held at Charbar m April ?9 o 4 , have been settled in part; the balance due now by this Chief against the original bonds is ^ 0-0 f u .'7 aidnc . e aue months’ time, the Zahir-us-Sultan being personally ‘respo^ible for^he payment esides this sum, a claim against Wall Khan, late Governor of Baluchistan for no S i Wali KL P n r0Ve Tb° ? 6 by 5 ahib P an and Dost Muhammad of Gaih and ot Wah Khan. This claim, and another for Rs. 68-9-0, against Wali Khan,Si have been taken over by this Chief, making the total amount due bv him Rs 4 8 0 7-9-a It is expected full settlement will very shortly be made by him. A i Rs ' a g ainst -ardar Said Khan, for plunder in the time of Wali ate Governor, has been settled. The Sardar has paid all except 300 Kursh, (Dollars Rs. 1-4-0 each), which he has agreed to pay in six months’ time. Kasirkund District .—claims against Jan Muhammad, Chief of this fS r ’ ct &gt; claims amounting to Rs. 1,662-7-0, one sword, and 160 Kasirkund maunds of wheat were admitted by him, and Rs. .20 paid in cash. For the balance bonds have been given and full settlement promised in six months’ time, failing set tlement, he is to be brought up at the Pishm meeting in January ,906. g Districts of Surbas, Dizak, Bampur, Lashar -Claims amounting t s. 11,856-2-0, 2 camels and one sword, against the people of these districts’ have been taken for enquiry by the Governor when travelling through them. If no settlement can be made by him. it has been agreed that he will have the defendants srastasr** ” '**■ ' te ' &gt;'““»■ ” 4s Haslnm Khan.—Claims against this ex-Governor of Perso- Baluchistan amounting to Rs. 3,680-,0-0 were gone into and decided, that the claims should be sent to K el man, and the Foreign Minister, in detail, and if not paid that he or his agent should appear at the Pishin meeting in January 1906, for enquiry into t i em ^ T t he , pIaint,ffS t0 u be alSO at Dashim Khan, his deputy, or the plaintiffs fail to appear, then the authorities assembled will take suitable action. Walt /Own.—Claim of Muhammad Said, Afghan, was brought up at the meeting at Charbar in April 1904, and for which Mr. Campbell a^ eed to accent Ks. 1 000 compensation, was gone into and decision arrived at, that this sum should be paid by Walt Khan at Kerman A special copy of the decision in this case to be sent to the British Consul at Kerman for action. f . 3 -^rf'' of Haji Akb„r Afghan at Ga/A.-There was a case of murder in the Uaih District about eight years ago. One Haji Akbar Afghan, it seemed was stoned to death in a dispute over a field. The matter was brought to mv notice by the brother of the murdered man in March 1903, about six years after the occur- rence. From enquiries made since then, I find the report was quite correct but it did not appear that the murdered man was a registered British Indian sub’ieet and I was doubtful whether any action, after so long a time, would be of any use’ 1 took advantage, however, of the meeting at Charbar, and referred the case for enquiry to the Nazim The matter has been settled according to Muhammadan Law- both plaintiff and defendant binding themselves to accept the decision of the Kazi, and the Governor to see that the decision is carried out. 3. The proposals enumerated below, which were put forward at the meeting and passed, are I consider useful. g {a) That if any defendant dies without leaving property, and this is proved to be true on enquiry to be held at Pishin in January 1906, the cases will be struck out. Defendants and plaintiffs in each case to have three months notice of the meeting, and if not present, cases will be gone into at the discretion of the authorities assembled. {b) That British Indian traders should not give loans of money to the Chiefs or people of the various districts of Perso Baluchistan unless the transaction is sanctioned by the Governor of Baluchistan and the Foreign Agent; if they do so without this sanction they must accept the risk, as no claims of this nature will be recognised in future. The traders however can advance money on property mortgaged to them. r r j (c) That Agents from the British Government and Karguzar of Moham- merah, should accompany the Zahir-us-Sultan when he leaves Char bar for settlement of outstanding cases in the various districts, the defendants not being present at Charbar. If cases are not settled, the Zahir us-Sultan to issue orders that the defendants will be pre sent at Pishin in January 1906 for enquiry into them.•4 (d) That the Ala-ul-Mulk at Kerman has consented, and agieed to by the Charbar meeting, that another meeting will take place at Pismu between the British and Persian authorities in January 1906, tof settlement of all outstanding cases, three months’ notice of this meeting to be given by both Persian and British Governments to all concerned. 4 With reference to proposal (^), the Native vernacular writer at Charbar, Mulla Musa, has been sent by me with the Zahir-us-Sultan He reports up 10 date from near Bampur that only seven cases have been settled, but as the Za hir« us-Sultan has been removed nothing further will be done pending arrival of the new Governor. The Karguzar of Mohamirerah has also sent a munshi with the Zahir us-Sultan to watch the cases. 5. Further report is unnecessary, as the translations of the documents forwarded explain fully the result of the meeting. 6 Mr. Pinsent, the officer in charge of the Charbar Station, acting as my deputy, has rendered most excellent service during the protracted enquiry of forty days, and the Nazim of Mekran, through his firm, tactful and patient behavi- our towards the Persian officials, has effected the excellent resuks reported; and 1 would strongly recommend both for handsome presents in recognition of their services. h His Excellency the Karguzar of Mohammerah rendered valuable asistance as Mamoor, his long and frequent telegrams to Tehran resulted in several strong- ly worded messages from the Prime Minister and other high Persian officials, thus facilitating the work in hand. Throughout the enquiry he backed up the Nazim in every way, and was always favourably disposed towards us. I would recommend a present be given him. 8. His Highness the Zahir-us-Sultan in the long run did well, his behaviour throughout was courteous. He took upon himself as much responsibility as could be expected of one in his difficult position. I have no doubt he would have carried out every agreement entered into if he had been retained in his position. It is left to be seen whether his successor will be ordered or pressed by the Ker man authorities to carry out these agreements. 9. Sardar Mehrab Khan, Chief of Kej, and Munshi Jhanda Khan of the Nazim’s staff, gave good assistance: the former with his advice as an experienced Sardar of Mekran, and the latter in composing and writing out the numerous documents that have been drawn up. Mulla Musa, the Charbar Station vernacu lar letter-writer, also did very well, and 1 would recommend them for presents suitable to their positions. 10. As I have only one munshi in my office, and the political work was very heavy during the Charbar meeting and subsequently, I have had to get the cor respondence clerk in my office to work after office hours to help him. bor the services rendered by him I wish to give him a present of Rs. 30, which I beg you will sanction. 11. Captain Haworth, the British Consul at Kerman, will be furnished with a full report of the meeting, and the documents in the vernacular which the Nazim submitted in duplicate.

From—The Nazim of Mekran, Charbar, To—The Officer in Political charge, Mekran Coast, Karachi. \ After compliments .—I beg to inform you that I left Turbat for Charbar under the orders of the Political Agent, Kalat and yours, the action taken by me in your cases with the Governor of Baluchistan, and the Karguzar of Moham merah and the special Mamoor of Persia, is as follows. Two lists (copies) of[C 463 FD] each Qarardad (agreement) have been taken by me from them Thev have -(also kept copies of the agreements for themselves. 7 t R \ he me e tIn g °f last year at Charbar, a sum of Rs. 8 ^84 for the claims of British Indian subjects, was proved against Mir AshrM a riv ( c du c f ms months’ extension for the payment of the amoim' in n a* 8 • een ? ra ^ te f V vo son named Ahdnl R a =„l n' /k' i lne ^moum, m consideration of which h s son, named Abdul Kasul has been kept as hostage with the Governor of Baluch istan, and the condition is that if the Governor of Baluchistan releases fhc hov nowpa d^nk 7 • Wl11 res P ons ' ble f or it. The Sardar has up to now paid only Ks. ^45, in cash and in articles, the balance of which Rc after a deduction of Rs^ 69, to make up the deficiency in the price of has been deposited with Mr. Pinsent. He is making efforts for the collection of the balance, on account of his son being imprisoned, and it is hoped that the balance will be paid by him at the end of the time allowed. P (2) Some cash, goods, and animals of British Indian subiects have Wn 5 h 0 Th M S h H1St R ! ,r k A k med - Khan ofBahu ’ i' consideration of which his son Sheikh Muhammad, has been given as hostage to the Governor of Baluchistan and oLTThh him If'ih r r Ahmed P f yS h,S , debtS ’ his son remain 3 impri- soned w ith him. If the Governor releases the boy without the payment being made, he will have to pay himself all the claims proved against Mir Ahmed By L’soon^he can^^ Mir Ahmed Wlil aIs ° make arran g em ^ts for payment ( a 3) In th . e ivT eetin / L ^ hs \ year at Charbar &gt; the undermentioned claims were proved against Mirs Abdi and Mahmud Khan of Dashtyari. ( 1 ) R s . 7 i n M^M 2 h Ca S iels l \ (i) C°ws 2, (4) Donkey 1. In consideration of these claims Mir Mahmuds son has been given as hostage to Sardar Said Khan, through the Governor of Baluchistan, and the promise is that the payment will be made within two months, and if Mir Mahmud fails to pay it during the time fixed the above Governor may take his son from the Sardar, and keep him in prison till the payment be made. If the Governor releases the bov without the payment being made, he will have to pay It from his own pocket. Mir Mahmud has up to now paid only Rs. 2,769-6 o, out of which Rs. 732 has already been paid to the claunants, and row after maAmg up the deficiency in the price of the camels, Rs 1,889 has been deposited with Mr. Pinsent. It is hoped that Mir Mahmud will pay the balance within two months on account of his son being imprisoned. At u (4) In tbe m ^ etln g ^ st y^r, a sum of Rs. 2,500 was proved against Sheikh alT- 33 an3 ^ oor Muhammad of Dashtyari which was written in the name of Mir Abdi, on account of being a Chief of the district. It was really standing against the former. In consideration of this amount, the son of Noor Muhammad and the grandson (from the daughter’s side) of Sheikh Muhammad have been given as hostages to the Governor of Baluchistan, with the view that the amount will be paid within two months, and it is hoped that the above Sheikh Muhammad and Noor Muhammad will pay the amount against them during the time fixed. (5) A camel of Tikamull Valumull has been proved against Mir Mahmud of Dashtyari, which he promises to return within 6 months. ( 6 ) A few claims were raised against Mir Abdi Khan in the meeting, but as he was not present there, it has been decided that he will be brought in the next meeting at Pishin by the Governor of Baluchistan, wherein presence of both the parties these claims will be settled. If the Governor fails to get him present before the meeting of Pishin, an ex-parte decree will be then passed, for the recovery of which the above Governor will be held responsible. Either the pay ment of the decree may be made by the Governor or by Mir Abdi. . , (?) Some claims were raised against the subjects of Mirs Abdi and Mahmud in the meeting. As neither the defendants nor Mir Abdi was present there it was decided that whoever of Mir Abdi and Mahmud is made a permanent Chief of Dashtyari by the Governor of Baluchistan, he should be ordered to bring all the defendants before the next meeting at Pishin. If they fail to be present therethe necessary proofs should then be taken from the claimants, and ex parte de crees should be passed in their favour, for the recovery of which the above Cover- * nor will be held responsible. (8) The claim of Dad Rahim against Sardar Said Khan has been settled Dad Rahim’s claim was for Rs. 1,831, which the above Sardar has paid m full, except 300 Qurshas, the payment of which has been promised in six months. (9) The claims against Sartip Hashim Khan, the late Governor of Baluchis tan were brought forward in the meeting, which have been decided to be brought up in the next meeting at Pishin, where both the parties will be present in person or by agents. If any of the parties fails to be present there, its excuse will not be taken notice of, and the meeting after its own judgment will get the decree executed passed by it. (10) In the meeting of last year, a sum of Rs. 8,071 was proved to be due to British Indian subjects by Sardar Said Khan, out of which Rs ^ as been paid b V him, and for the payment of balance Rs 4,873, an extension of two months has been given to him at his request. The Governor of Baluchistan has held himself responsible for the payment of the balance. Rs. 5 00 f rom balance has been paid by the Sardar to Tursiamull. There is now only a sum of Rs. 4,373 due by the Sardar, which is hoped will be paid by him at the end of the time allowed. If he fails to pay it during the time fixed, the Governor of Baluchistan, being a security for him, will himself pay it. (11) As regards the murder of Akbar Afghan it has been decided by the meeting that both parties should refer it to Shara (Muhammadan Law), and that whatever settlement is made by the Kazi selected by them, should be caused to be put in execution by the Governor of Baluchistan. (12) A great many fresh claims were raised by British Indian subjects against such people who were not present in the meeting. So it has been decided that Mullah Musa a Government servant, and a man of the Karguzar of Mohammerah, should go with the Governor of Baluchistan, who will get all the defendants brought before the two Mamoors and the claimants. If nothing is done there, he will bring them before the next meeting at Pishin. If any of the defendants fails to be present in that meeting, an ex parte decree will be passed against him, for the execution of which the above Governor will be held responsible. (13) As many claims as were standing against Mir Jan Muhammad of Kas* sirkund have been setiled, for the payment he has been given six months’ time. If he fails to pay the amounts proved against him during the time fixed, the Governor of Baluchistan is responsible to recover them from him After the settlement being made, Mir Jan Muhammad paid Rs 60 to i ursiamull, and Rs. 60 to Otoomull. The Governor has promised with the view of Jan Muhammad’s case that he will not go to Kasirkund for the next six months, and not interfere with him. (14) The claim of Hashim has been settled against Sahib Khan. Neither the divorced woman nor Sahib Khan will ask Hashim for the dowry. If the woman Mariam will do so in future, Sahib Khan will be responsible for it. (15) A proposal has been passed that if the plaintiff or defendant should die, the claim should be dismissed, otherwise settled. If any defendant, whether a Persian or a British Indian subject, goes to one another’s country, then the officer whose subject he is, should write, three months before the Pishin meeting, to the officer under whose jurisdiction he is, to send him to the meeting of Pishin. The officer is bound either to send him to the meeting during these three months, or to drive him out of his country, so that he may return to his native place. ( 16 ) This regulation has also been passed that British Indian subjects should give no loans to the Persian Chiefs without having something as mort gage from them, and they should give nothing to them without the approval of the Governor of Baluchistan, and the Karguzar of the Foreign Department of Persia, otherwise their claim against them will betaken no notice of.7 O?) I* I ias also been decided that the Governor of Baluchistan should i?sue a notice at the time of his departure from Chaibar, that those who have claims against the people residing between Charbar and Bampur, Bampurand Sarawan, Sarawan and Surhad, should be present before him within two months from the date of the receipt of his orders. If their claims are not settled there, they will be again brought up in the next meeting at Pishin. % (ib) This proposal has also been passed that another meeting will be held at Pishin by the middle of January 1906 . ( 19 ) There were three claims against Vali Khan, the late Governor of Baluchistan, out cf which a claim of Bachumul Bhagumull for Rs. 366 has been proved against Sahib Khan and Dost Muhammad. Sardar Said Khan has pro mised to pay this claim within two months. The other claim for Rs. 75*14 is of Haji Abdul Husein. This claim has also been taken by Sardar Said Khan upon himself, which will be paid by him within two months. The third claim is of Muhammad Said Afghan. This case has been referred to Mushir*ed-Dowleh at Tehran by the Karguzar and special Mamoor, but it has yet drawn no conclusion. If another meeting wall be held for the settlement of this case in a day or two, it will be brought to your notice. Two copies of the decision of each case from Nos. 1 to 14 are sent to you through Mr. Pinsent, out of which one copy of each case is for you, and the other for the Consul at Kerman. The copies of the decision of remaining claims from Nos. 15 to 18 , one of each, are also sent to you through the same officer. As I have to leave this place for Turbat after a day or two, Sardar Said Khan, Mirs Ashraf and Muhammad Khan, etc., will pay their claims in cash or in animals, etc., to Mr. Pinsent who will be informing you, from time to time, of the recoveries made by him. After perusal of the copies of decisions, my action will be known to you, and I strongly hope tha* those decisions will draw a good conclusion. All the claims of British Indian subjects wall be settled in the next meeting at Pishin. Kindlv inform all British Indian subjects of the order mentioned in paragraph No. 16 , and send all the claimants to the Governor of Baluchistan on receipt of his orders about their presence, so that the settlement of their claims may be made. Besides this, the Karguzar of Mohammerah and special Mamoor has rendered valuable assistance to Mr. Pinsent and myself in settlement of these cases. I have also informed the Political Agent, Kalat, of it. This Murasila is sent to you wuth full particulars for information. Tra r slation of a Muarila No. 232 , dated the loth May 1905 .

Some claims of British Indian subjects for Rs. 8,374 were proved last year by Vali Khan, the late Governor of Baluchistan, Ali Khan, the Akram-u-Suitan and Mamoor-e-Ayalat, Kerman, and Mr. Campbell, the Agent to the Officer in Political Charge, Mekran Coast, against Mir Ashraf Khan for which he gave bonds countersigned by these officers, which are produced before this meeting in original. In accordance with the terms of these bonds, Mir Ashraf Khan, should have paid the amount of Rs. 6,624, which he has not done yet. As the defendant was himself present in this meeting, he asked for an extension in the period of the payment, but the Mamoors of both the Governments did not comply with his request with a view of averting the difficulties, and decided that his son Abdul Rasul should be put in custody of Shahzada Zahir-us-SuItan, who will be regarded by him as a son, until he makes necessary arrangements for the pay ment of his debts. If he is unable to pay in cash, he can give goods and cattle of any kind except slaves. The price of the things which he will give in payment of his debts will be fixed by two Mamoors, one of each Government, to which no one can raise objection. Unless he pays something he can redeem no bonds and his son Abdul Rasul may remain with the above Governor as already decided! The Governor has no authority to release the boy, or make him escape, unless the payment is made. If the boy escapes, he will be held responsible for pav- ment of all the debts against Mir Ashraf. When the payment is made by Mir Ashraf to the Mamoors of the British Government, and receipts obtained bv him from them, the boy should then be released. If the Governor releases the' boy before the payment of the debts, he will himself be held responsible for them. If the present Governor is transferred elsewhere, he should give Abdul Rasui in charge of his successor on the conditions mentioned above, and if be does not accept the conditions, the boy should not be released unless the debts are paid. This agreement has been written at the consent of the Mamoors of both the Governments. Signatures and seals of the Persian officials :— (1) Shahzada Zahir-us-Sultan, Governor of Perso-Baluchistan.

The undermentioned claims of British Indian subjects against Mirs Abdi and Mahmud Khan, which were settled last year by Vali Khan, the late Governor of Baluchistan, All Khan, the Akram-us-Sultana and Mamoor-e-Ayalat, Kerman, and Mr. Campbell, Agent to the Officer in Political Charge, Mekran Coast, were produced before meeting for recovery. As Abdi Khan was not present in the meeting and as his brother, Mahmud Khan, had joined the meeting, it was decided after a long discussion that he should give his son, Mir Durra, in custody of Sardar Said Khan as security, and that Mahmud Khan should himself go to bring his brother, Mir Abdi Khan, with the cash in two months which should be paid to the Mamoors of British Government through the Karguzars of the Foreign Department of Persia, for which a receipt should be obtained from them. If Sardar Said Khan releases his son before the payment is made, he should be held responsible for the amounts. Shahzada Zahir-us-Sultan stands security for the above Sardar. If before the payment of the claims the present Governor is transferred elsewhere, then he should give the son of Mahmud Khan in his successor’s charge, and obtain a receipt from him for whom he will be held responsible. This agreement has been written with the consent of the Mamoors of both the Governments. List of claims against Mir Abdi Khan— (1) Abdu Shalu—Rs. 80. (2) Dharmu Mulchand—Rs. 1,000. (3) Muhammad Kamu—Rs. 18. (4) Tikamull—Rs 8, 1 cowhand two camels. (5) Mangumull—Rs. 70. (6) Abdoo Thawar—Rs. 1,022. (7) Gola Duryai—Rs. 120. (8) Otoomull—Rs. 2,000. (9) Haji Hamid—Rs. 485.

As Mir Mahmud Khan was a Vakil for Mir Abdi himself, he was asked to pay the sum of Rs. 2,500, for which a bond was given signed by Mir Abdi and himself to the undermentioned people, and which was produced by them before the meeting for recovery. He said in reply that the amount should be paid by Noor Muhammad, a brother of Sheikh Muhammad, who committed the loot. He was then asked why Noor Muhammad should pay it while the bond was given sealed and signed by them. He then said that as Noor Muhammad and Sheikh Muhammad were not present in the meeting last year it was considered better by Vali Khan, the late Governor of Perso-Baluchistan, and Ali Khan, the Akram- us-Sultana, to get such a bond from us, which they did. This statement of Mir Mahmud Khan was corroborated by others also. As the crime was committed by Noor Muhammad, brother of Sheikh Muhammad, he has given his grandsons, named Murad Muhammad and Ghulam Muhammad, in custody of the Governorship of Baluchistan as securities. It is now decided by the meeting that the above Governorship has no authority, to release the prisoners or let them escape without any orders. When Noor Muhammad or Sheik Muhammad has paid the claim in cash or in articles to the Mamoors of British Government through the Karguzars of the Foreign Department of Persia, for which a receipt should be obtained by him from them, then the Governorship can release them. If the Governorship lets the prisoners escape, or releases them without the claim being settled, it will have to pay the claim itself. If the present Governor is transferred elsewhere he should give the prisoners in charge of his successor in accordance with this judgment, for he is bound to act upon it. This agreement has been executed with the consent of the Mamoors of both the Governments. Names of (1) Bachumull. (2) Bhagumull. (3) Sakanmull. (4) Otoomull. THE PARTNERS IN THE BOND.

Mir Mahmud Khan, brother of Mir Abdi Khan, was asked to pay the claim of Tikamull Valumull, a British Indian subject, which was raised against him for one share in a male camel, and two shares in a female one, for which a bond was given to the claimant by Mir Abdi Khan in his name. He replied that he owes only one share in the male camel and one in a female camel which he would return to the claimant. The claimant after a lengthy speech pressed upon the defendant to return those shares early. But the meeting passed a decision at the consent of both the parties that a male camel about two or four years old should be given to him within the period of six months through the Mamoors of British Government, for which a receipt should be obtained from them.

As to the claims of British Indian subjects against the Persian subjects, and of the Persian subjects against British Indian subjects, for which the necessary bonds were entered into between the Mamoors of both the Governments, it has been decided by the meeting, with the view of averting the difficulties that if the claimants or defendants should die without leaving any property behind to meet with the claims, they must be brought forward in the next meeting for proofs, and if the Mamoors may think them “ Kan Lam Yakun ” (unfounded), should be struck out, and if it m^y be known that the claimants and defendants are still alive, and they possess sufficient property to meet with the claims against them, then the bonds given for them should be put in execution. It it is known that the defendant also is subject of the same Government of which the claimant is, then the defendant should three months before the date fixed for the meeting, let the Mamoors of his Government know, and if he fails to be present in the meeting or leaves his residence, then the claims raised against him will be considered as proved, and will not be interrupted in any way.

As some of the Chiefs and Khawanins (khans or headmen) of Perso-Balu chistan borrow money from British Indian subjects, and do not pay them back, and inevitably give them bonds for these amounts, and as British Indian subjects deal with them with a view of overcharging them, by doing which they involve both the Governments in difficulties, this has hereby been decided by the meeting, that if British Indian subjects want to deal with any Sardars or Khawanins of Baluchistan, they should themselves obtain satisfaction from them, or should do so at their own risk, or get documents and bonds from them countersigned and sealed by the Karguzars of the Foreign Departments of those places. Unless they act upon these “ Shaka” (rulings) they are themselves responsible for their losses. As both of the subjects are traders, they should not create troubles for their governments. The bonds which British Indian subjects hold entered into before passing this decision are excepted. This decision has been approved by the Mamoors of both the Governments.

Owing to the absence of the defendants in the meeting, some of the claims of British Indian subjects against the Persian subjects could not be enquired into, and it has therefore been decided that a Mamoor from the Foreign Department of Persia, and one from the Political Agency and Nazamat of Mekran should go with His Highness Zahir-us-Sultan, the Gov ernor of Baluchistan to the residences of the defendants to settle the claims raised against them, and if nothing is done there, they should obtain necessary satisfaction from the defendants for their presence in the next meeting which will be held at Pishin, where they should settle the claims against them satisfactorily. It has also been decided that if the defendants of any claimant resides within the limits of Bampur, the claimant should present himself before His Highness within the course of two months from the date of his departure from Charbar, when the defendant will be ordered to be present in Bampur within the period of two months, and thus if the defendant of any claimant resides between Sardwan and Kash the claimant then should be present before His Highness two months before his departure. His Highness should inform the above Mamoors sometime before his departure. If only the claimant or defendant presents himself and the settlement is not made, then the Mamoor of British Government for the claimants, and His Highness the Governor for defendants, should make necessary arrangements for presence of both the parties in the next meeting at Pishin, and if the claimants or defendants fail to be present there, then no excuse of his will be considered, and whatever settlement will be made by the meeting will not be objected to, by the claimants or the defendants. This agreement has been approved by the Mamoors of both the Governments. Signatures and seals of the Persian officials :— ( 1 ) Shahzada Zahir-us-Sultan, Governor of Perso-Baluchistan.

The cause of writing these few lines is that the claims of Muhammad Said ;e, ileki Afghan and Haji Abdul Husein, the British Indian subjects against Wali Khan the late Governor of^ Baluchistan were brought forward in this meeting. As Wali Khan was not himself present in the meeting, His Highness wanted to dis prove (dismiss) them, but for the claim of Muhammad Said Afghan there was a bond already verified in which neither the name of Muhammad Said nor of Wali Khan, nor the amount of claim was put to show clearly whether there was anyth ing due to Muhammad Said by Wali Khan. But Messrs. Campbell and Pinsent the Agents to the Officer in political charge, Mekran Coast, and Haji Abdul Husein and Sardar Said Khan gave evidence that Wali Khan had himself taken one thou sand rupees upon him which should now be paid out. At last it was decided by the meeting that Aitla-o-LWeh, the Karguzar and Special Mamoor of Persia^ and the Agent to the Officer in political charge, Mekran, should wire to “ Murativ ” (higher authorities) at Kerman to recover the amount of two thousand rupees from him through the Foreign Department of Persia and British Consulate of that place. Accordingly a reply came from Kerman about the claim of Haji Abdul Husein for Rs. 68 - 9-0 that when the bond was given to him signed and sealed by Wali Khan, Sardar Said Khan was asked by him to pay the amount to Haji Abdul Husein, and that if Said Khan does not do so the bond should be sent to Kerman, where the recovery of the amount will be made. The above Sardar then spoke that the amount of Haji Abdul Husein would be paid after one month, and that if he fails to do so during the time fixed the bond will then not be asked for, and the amount will be paid by them in ac cordance with the terms of the bond of Wali Khan, which have been agreed upon by them.

In accordance with the orders of Shahzada Zahir-us-Sultan, the Governor of Baluchistan, necessary enquiries were made about Maliyat (tax) and an amount of 15 Tomans per annum was found “ Badhi ” (payable). It is therefore being given in writing to Dadrahim and Abdul Nabi, for their ease and satisfac tion, that as long as I am in charge of Gaih they are free from the civil taxes, and I will demand nothing from them, but on the contrary will take the 15 Tomans upon myself. If another man takes the charge of Gaih and Bint, he cannot increase the tax more than 15 Tomans in accordance with this agreement, and if any increase is made in the ta*es, then the Government should investigate into it. This agreement has been put in writing under the order of Shahzada Zahir- us-Sultan, so that the subjects may remain at eace.

From The DEPUTY SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA in the Foreign Department^ To The Hon’ble Mr. A. L. P. TUCKER, AGENT to the GOYERNOE-GENERAL in BALUCHISTAN. Dated Simla, the 26th September 1905. Sir, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1097 Z., dated the 23rd August 1905, submitting a report by the Political Agent, Kalat, on the meeting held at Charbar, in April and May of the current year, between the Nazim of Mekran and the Deputy Governor of Bampur. 2 . The result of the meeting is considered by the Government of India to be generally satisfactory, and they concur in the view expressed in the second paragraph of your letter, with reference to the responsibility of the new Deputy Governor of Bampur for the engagements entered into by his predecessor. 3. I am to forward, for your information, two letters from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Nos. 409 and 425, dated, respectively, the 26th August and 3rd September 1905, with the first of which Major Cox submits a report by the Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs on the Charbar meeting, and in the second recommends the grant of rewards to certain officials and others who were present. The circumstances under which the Director deputed Mr. Pinsent, the clerk in charge of the Charbar Telegraph Station, to be present at the meeting, where he appears to have taken precedence over the Nazim and to have practically presided, are not known to the Government of India. The Telegraph Department has not been represented on the occasions of previous meetings, and the cases under settlement were unconnected with the limits of the telegraph stations along the Mekran coast under the Director’s charge. It is assumed, since Colonel Showers has raised no complaint of Mr. Pinsent’s presence and action, that he concurs that they were unobjec tionable, but the effect has been that the Government of India have received two reports on the same subject, the one, for which Mr. Pinsent was responsible, having attained a quite unnecessary length,—not less than 30 pages of printed foolscap; while you will observe by a comparison of paragraph 3 of Mr. Campbell’s report with paragraph 8 of Major Showers’ that the views held by the former and Major Cox differ entirely from those held by Major Showers, regarding some of the points put to the meeting and passed. The views of Major Showers are those which commend themselves to Government. 4 . I am to enquire exactly in what position the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, stands with regard to the annual meeting between the Deputy Governor of Bampur and the Khan’s Nazim, and whether it is proposed that, in his political capacity, he should always attend, or be represented at, these meetings. There may be reasons unknown to the Government of India which render this procedure desirable, and, if so, they should he stated. In any case,Foreign Office Press—No. 1151-29-9.05—79. to avoid a repetition of the unnecessary writing and printing which have taken place on the present occasion, it should be laid down, unless you see any objec tion, that any report on the meetings which may he written by the repre sentative of the Telegraph Department should be addressed to the Political Agent in Kalat, instead of to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who should, however, he furnished with a copy of the report. 5 . With reference to Major Cox’s letter of the 3rd September, proposing the grant of rewards, I am to say that, as the cost of any presents that may he given will he borne by the Baluchistan Agency Toshakhana or Secret Service grants, the Government of India will leave the decision with yourself. I am, however, to observe that the proposal to grant a handsome present to the Nazim of Mekran for merely doing his duty seems to he a somewhat unusual one.

With reference to the large amount of unnecessary printing entailed by Mr. Campbell having addressed his very lengthy report to you, I am to observe that at least six or seven pages could have been saved by the simple expedient of avoiding the constant repetition of the names and signatures of the various British and Persian representatives present at each day’s sitting. 3.

I have the honour to reply to Mr. Clarke s letter No. 33S6-F., dated 2,6th September 1905, on the subject of the meeting in the current year between the Nazim of Mekran and the Deputy Governor of Bampur. 2. .Major Showers, to whom I have referred on the subject of the scope of the functions exercised by the Director-General of Persian Gulf Telegraphs at this meeting, reports that the Director-General has, in his political capacity, no connection whatever therewith. The claims made on the part of the Director- General for settlement at the meeting were forwarded to Major Showers before the meeting and the list was duly brought forward at the meeting and the settle ments arrived at that have been already reported. The telegraph claims are not restricted to claims incidental to transactions within the limits of the telegraph stations, but cover dealings by telegraph employes outside these limits, and hence the list of cases settled received through the Director-General has assumed great length and the cases are not classified. The Mekran cases not connected with the Telegraph Department are those, 25 in number, of which a list was received and submitted with my letter No. t 1097-Z., dated 23rd August 1905, and these re-appear in the enclosures to Mr. Clarke’s letter under acknowledgment, along with the telegraph cases and the points of general application settled at the meeting. As to these last the rules arrived at should, as Major Showers has already recommended, be regarded as introduced only tentatively and the question of adherence to them reopened at the next meeting which will be attended by the Assistant Political Agent, Mekran, and the Nazim. I agree with Major Showers, a copy of whose report No. 774-Y., dated 27th October 1905, is enclosed, that there is no objection to the representation of the Indo-European Telegraph Department at these meetings. I agree with him also that the functions of the Director or his representative must be limited to appearance on behalf of the Department, and that the Departmental officer attending the meeting must act in subordination to the Kalat Agency Officer representating British interests at the meeting. I am arranging on my coming tour in Mekran to present to the Nazim of Mekran and Sirdar Mehrab Khan of Kej gifts corresponding with those recommended by the Officiating Director- General. That however recommended for Mr. Pinsent seems to me to be one for the Director-General to bestow if it is to be given at all: I regret that I have no funds at my disposal from which I can make this presentation, which does not seem to be one that I am called upon to make. No. 774-V., dated Mastung, the 27th October 1905. 'From— Major H. L. Showers, C.I.E., Political Agent, Kalat, To*f*-The Hon’ble Mr. A. B. P. Tucker, C.I.E., Officiating Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. With reference to paragraph 3 of your First Assistant’s letter No. 4797, of the 14th October 1905, forwarding, for report on certain points, letter No. 3386-E., from the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Depart ment, regarding the meeting held at Charbar in April and May last, between the Nazim of Mekran and the Deputy Governor of Bampur, I have the honour to observe as follows. 2. The Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, has, in his political capacity, no connection whatever with these border meetings. It is only in his capacity of Director, and as a party to claims by and against his Department, that he appears. Prior to the late meeting he sent the Nazim a list of telegraph claims against Persian subjects and asked that they might be put forward at the meeting. There was no mention of Mr. Pinsent, but the latter being on the spot would seem to have attended the meeting on behalf of the Director. It2 certainly does seem, however, that he took a more prominent part in the^ pro.&gt; ceedings than his position in relation to the meeting justified. This is evident from his having taken upon himself the submission of a report dealing not only with his own cases but with general matters also. 3 . As to future arrangements I see no objection to the Indo-European Telegraph Department being represented at these meetings either by the Director in person or by one of his Assistants. Eut the officer deputed should appear, I think, on behalf of his own department only and not in a political capacity and in any case he should act in subordination to the Kalat Agency Officer representing British interests. There must be many telegraph cases, the settlement of which could only be brought about at a meeting such as this; while on general grounds the more we add to the importance and scope of the meeting the more hope is there of its proceedings being authoritative and binding, alike on the local Persian officials and the Government of the Shah. 4 . With regard to the presents which the Resident in the Persian Gulf has proposed on the recommendation of the Director to bestow on M ekran officials it certainly seems, as Mr. Clarke remarks, that the step is unnsual and unneces sary. I would urge, however, that the matter having gone as far as it has the proposal should not now be negatived. To do so would be both to put the Director in a false position and to cause some disappointment, if not humili ation, to the grantees who are doubtless aware of the proposal on the subject. f? No. 553, dated Bushire, the 18th November 1905. Prom— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— Sir L. W. Dane, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt, on return from tour, of your letter No. 3387-P., dated the 26th of September 1905, enclosing a copy of your letter No. 3386, of the same date, to the address of the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, to which my attention is invited. 2 . In regard to the last mentioned letter, I respectfully beg to offer the following remarks by way of explanation of the connection of the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, and myself with the recent Charbar meeting. For some years past, the Director of the Persian Gulf Telegraphs, in his political capacity, has arranged an annual meeting—usually at Charbar—with the local chiefs and officials of Persian Baluchistan, for the settlement or outstanding cases between the British Indian subjects residing or trading on the Persian-Mekran Coast, and Persian subjects. In 1904, this meeting took place at Charbar at the end of April, and the Director was represented by Mr. Campbell, at present Acting Director. On this occasion, the Persian Gov ernment deputed the Ittila-ud-Dowlah, Karguzar of Mohammerah, to represent their Foreign Office, and the Deputy Governor of Bampur and Ali Khan Akrem-us-Sultaneh, to represent the Kerman local Government. Actually, the Kar^uzar of Mohammerah did not arrive in time to assist at the meeting. In this°connection 1 beg to call attention to my letter No. 212, dated the uth Jure 1904, and accompaniments, and to your letter No. 2761-E. A., dated 24th August 1904, in which you informed me that the Government of India had been pleased to approve of the proceedings. 3. I note that, on 16th February 1902, it was arranged between Major Showers and the local authorities at Kerman that an annual meeting should take place between representatives of the Kalat Political Agency and the Kerman local Government to settle border cases. I am not aware how many meetings have taken place under this arrangement, but I do not think that they have been regular, and I note, from a letter of Major Sykes,* that none took place in 1903. This year, 1905, a meeting between the Deputy Governor of Bampur and the Nazim of Mekran was arranged, and these two officials fixed upon Charbar * No. 205, of 15th July lf04, forwarded to Gov ernment under this office letter No. 270 of 20th August 1904.as the raost convenient place of meeting. The Persian Government again deputed the Ittila-ud-Dowlah to represent their Foreign Office at the meeting. It will be noted that there are two classes of claims against the Kerman Government, viz.: ( 1 ) International claims between Persia and India, and ( 2 ) private claims against Persians, made by British subjects residing at Gwettur Charbar and other places on or near the Coast of Persian Baluchistan The trontier meeting to decide the first class of case, having been arranged for Charbar and the Persian officials necessary having been ordered to proceed to that place’ which is a centre of British Indian trade in Persian Baluchistan and the most convenient place for settling cases in the second category, it seemed obviouslv advisable that the annual meeting between the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs and the local officials should coincide with the frontier meeting. ° 4. It was under these circumstances that Mr. Pinsent was present at the meeting and represented the officer in Political charge of the MeIcran Coast. Strictly speaking, he need only have attended the discussion of cases of the second class mentioned above. 5. I trust that the Government of India will be pleased to give me instruc tions in due course, as to whether, in the event of a future meeting takino* place at Charbar or elsewhere on the Coast of Persian Baluchistan, I am to allow the claims of British subjects residing in that province to be represented at the meeting, or whether I should arrange a separate one if possible. I think there would be actually some difficulty in making the latter arrangement. As it was, the Ittila-ud-Dowlah was very much averse to going to such an uncivilised place as Charbar, and remained for a long time at Bushire, subject to friendly pressure from me, before making up his mind, and would probably have been late again this year, if he had not been thus kept up to the mark. To rouse the local authorities at Bampur into attending two separate meetings would, I fear, require a more lively application of the rowels than we can practically apply,’ and should the Government of India for this reason decide that it would be expedient, whenever possible, to have one meeting instead of two, I think it would be advisable that the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, or his Agent, should be present at the settlement of the claims of British subjects residing within his jurisdiction, and that his report on the result of the meeting should be submitted through the Eesident, Persian Gulf, as heretofore. He would be asked to cut down his summary to the utmost, and I would further edit any such report, so that repetitions of signatures, names of parties present, etc., might not cause unnecessary printing. I would mention that in cases in the second category, the Political Agent, Kalat, would have no authority, as they are claims by British Indian subjects residing in Persia, against Persian subjects. 6 . With reference to the remark in paragraph 2 of your letter No. 33^6 that the cases under settlement were not connected with the limits of the telegraph stations under the Director’s charge, I would respectfully invite a reference to the enclosure sent with my letter No. 409, dated 20th August 1905, viz., letter No. 227, dated 7th May, from the Nazim of Mekran to the Director, from which it will be seen that claims of British Indian subjects residing in Persian Baluchistan amounting to some thousands of rupees, were settled during the meeting; and I would ask Government to note that the British Indian traders Ootoomul, Bhojamull, Bochimull, Shammumull, Assumull, and others whose names constantly recur among the lists of claimants, are resident within the limits of the Political charge of the Director, Persian Gulf Section. All such claims have always been preferred through the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, and this office, to the Persian Government, and until such time as the administrative machinery is altered in this respect, it seems necessary that the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, or some representative of his who is familiar with the cases, should be present at any meeting at which they are discussed. 7. In regard to the concluding portion of your letter No. 3386-F., from which I note that on certain points the views held by Mr. Campbell and myself differ from those held by Major Showers, and that the latter commend themselves to the Government of India; I would ask that if they are of any importance to me for future guidance, Major Showers’ views may be communicated to me.8 . There is one other point in connection with the meeting in regard to which some further explanation from me may be advisable. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Ittila-ud-Dowlah asked officially for Karguzar’s fees on the amount represented by the cases settled. I made a reference to His Majesty’s Minister deprecating the recognition of such a claim, and in reply Sir Arthur Hardinge expressed the opinion that it should not be admitted, but recommended at the same time that, as the Ittila had been useful in the past and might be again, a present, value about 3oO tomans, might be given him with the accompanying explanation, that, as he was, while on this duty, acting as a Political officer attending the settlement of interstatal cases, fees were not legally leviable. His Excellency added that the Ittila would prefer bis present in cash. On the grounds above explained, I trust the Government of India will be pleased to sanction funds for the present recommended for the Ittila-ud-Dowah, even if the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan does not see his way to meet it, among others from his sanctioned grants.

Resident in the Persian Gulf on the sub ject, together with a copy of the reply which has been sent thereto. The Government of India agree that it is desir able that the Indo-European Telegraph Department should be represented at these annual meetings, and that it would be inadvisable to attempt to arrange in future a separate meeting for the settlement of telegraph cases or cases of the class which the Director of the Persian Gulf Telegraphs in his political capaciiy has hitherto settled direct with the local chiefs and officials of Persian Baluchistan. Disputes between Persian subjects and British Indian subjects residing or trading on the Persian-Mekran Coast are, as pointed out by Major Cox, beyond the authority of the Political Agent, Kalat. The Political Resident m the Persian Gulf will accordingly be instructed to arrange for the presence at future meetings of a representative of the Indo-European Telegraph Department whose report regarding the cases, with which he is competent to deal, will be submitted to the Government of India through the Resident in the Persian Gulf, a copy at the same time being sent direct to the Political Agent, Kalat, for his information. Should any question of general principles arise, which may be applicaole to Biitisb Indian subjects in Balucb Mekran, as well as to those in Persian Mekran, the representative of the Telegraph Department must act in subordination to the officer of the Kalat Agency present at the meeting.

When writing, Major Sykes had particularly in his mind the 'Sara- wan cases, but it seems unnecessary to specialize or go into details here as I merely desire to ascertain the views of Government as to the general question raised. Apart fiom considerations of etiquette which may be involved and without going so far as to suggest that Baluchistan claims against persons under Kerman should only be pressed through Major Sykes, I am decidedly of opinion that it is likely to conduce to our general interests if Major Sykes is at all events kept informed when it is desired to apply pressure in connection with Baluchistan and Kalat claims, in order that he may be in a portion to co operate or offer, such suggestions as the Kerman aspect of the case may prompt.

Extract fron a letter No. 116, dated 7th April 1904, from Major P. M. Sylces, C.M G His Britannic Majesty’* Consul, Kerman, to Major P. Z. Cox, C. IE., Political ’Resident in the Persian Gulf. ******* ****** ******* 4. Regarding Sarawan cases j would strongly urge that the annual instal ments due by Jiand Khan and Shah Jahan, etc , be not pressed They will only be raised with great difficulty, whereas, if not paid, they provide a power ful political lever of great value. Personally I sympathize with the Baluchis who consider that the raids have not all been from their side, and that their punishment has already been very severe. Bowever a small sum might be squeezed out of Nawab Khan, but the political effect would be very bad. In this connexion, I would again venture to point out that it is hardly conducive to good results for the authorities on the Baluchistan side of the frontier to be pressing for payment of these sums independently of and without informing me. The sole result is that their letters are forwarded to the Kargnzar of Kerman who, wore he so disposed, might make capital out of this arrange ment. The telegraph line will shortly unite Kerman to Quetta and I would venture to suggest that the system whereby the British authorities entirely ignore this consulate in frontier questions might perhaps be slightly modified with good results. No. 167, dated the 23rd May 1904. From— Major P. M. Sykes, C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Kerman, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In reply to your letter No. 418 of 1904, I regret that I did not give suffi cient references to former correspondence to make my meaning clear in my No. 116 of 7th April 1904. 1 c 3The correspondence dealing with the Sarawan cases is contained in a report of Major Showers, C.I.E. (No. 1165, dated 31st May 1902) of which you doubt less have a copy in your files. In conjunction with the Governor-General of Kerman, a tour in Persian Baluchistan was undertaken hy Major Showers early in 1902, and heavy punishment was meted out to various chiefs who had taken part in a raid on Kalat soil. It was furthermore arranged that an annual meeting should take place on the Baluch frontier between the Nazim of Makran and the Persian Governor at which, in addition to settling any fresh cases, instalments of the fines levied on and due by Sirdars Jiand Khan and Shah Jahan were to be paid {vide pages 42 and 47 of 'Major Showers’s report). Hitherto no instalment has been forthcoming, and in my opinion, it would be extremely difficult to raise considerable sums of money from the already ruined Sirdars. In this connexion Jiand Khan should pay Rs. 1,217-8-9 per year for ten years and Shah Jahan Rs. 600 for seven years, plus one instalment of Rs. 800. The value of these debts when unpaid appears to form so valuable a politi cal asset that I would suggest that I be instructed to do nothing more than formally mention their existence to the new Governor-General. As stated in my previous letter, raids have not always been made from this side of the frontier and the general opinion in Persian Baluchistan is that the fullest reparation has already been exacted, as in addition to the money, stock etc., seized on the British account, the Chiefs were both squeezed and eaten up by the Persian authorities. v After all the sums are insignificant, but by just keeping the claims going we may in the future find them extremely valuable.

Dane, Esq., I.C.S., Secretary to the Government of India iu the Foreign Department. In continuation of my letter No. 183, dated 25th June, I have the honour •v t to forward herewith a further communi- cation* irom Major Sykes, suggesting a definite system of co-operation, between the British authorities in Baluchis tan and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Kerman. 2 . I see nothing unreasonable in the suggestions made, and trust that the general question of co-operaiion raised may receive early consideration at the hands of Government. No. 170, dated 26th May 1904. From— Major P. M. Sykes, C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Now that Kerman is joined to Quetta hy a direct telegraph line, I would suggest that Government be requested to consider the advisability of effecting a change from the existing arrangements which do not, in my humble opinion, w ork well in some respects. The present arrangement is for officials on the frontier to write on various subjects to the Persian Governor, or his subordinates without sending a copy of the correspondence to this Consulate, or informing me of their action. For instance the Governor of Bampur was pressed to meet the Nazim of Makran on the frontier at the beginning of this year. He naturally applied for ins tructions to the Governor-General of Kerman, who commented to me on what 2 n is? pen co-c po$i it is aB3 appeared to Mm to be an incorrect method of procedure. However, I pressed the matter and, after reference to Tehran, Yali Khan was informed that he might proceed to the frontier, but these instructions were probably received too late. Again some months ago, Vali Khan sent a letter to the Governor- General from the British side, in which he was urged to pay up the instal- ments due by the two Sirdars, Jiand Khan and Shah Jehan Khan. This too he referred to Kerman for instructions. I could cite more instances but enough has, I think, been stated to show that the present arrangement is undesirable, because it would appear, at any rate to outsiders, that there is no desire to co-operate with this Consulate in frontier questions. This action is probably due to ignorance as to how Persian Baluchistan is governed, but its result is to seriously hamper me in my work. Again, were the Persian authorities anything but friendly, it is clear that this lack of co-operation, would weaken the position and prestige of this Consulate. During Major Phillott’s tenure of this post, it was, I understand, specially arranged by Major Showers that he should correspond direct with the Persian Governor General at Kerman. This was done, and resulted in a distinct weakening of the position of this Consulate. 2 . I would venture to point out that at Charhar, where co-operation by the telegraph authorities with this Consulate has been constantly main tained, Mamurs have been despatched from Kerman to settle cases on two occasions, and I have recently been informed that every case in the dis tricts through which the line runs, has been recently settled by a Mamur sent from Kerman who was supported by the Governor of Baluchistan in person. During the meeting, telegrams containing exhortations and in structions were constantly despatched to the Mamur by the Kerman au thorities all of which were submitted to me and it is fairly safe to say, that such success would not have been obtained without the freest and heartiest co-operation. 3 . I have no desire to deal with these questions from a narrow stand point, hut it seems to me that now that the Belgian element is permeating the frontier, it is desirable that every British official should be able to work to the best advantage in what is by no means a very easy task and one in which lack of co-operation seems specially dangerous. I would therefore suggest that:— (а) Frontier officials he requested not to correspond with the Persian Governor-General of Kerman except through this office. ( б ) Prontier officials be requested to correspond as far as possible with the Persian Governor of Baluchistan and his subordinates through this Consulate and, where this is impossible, that copies of corre spondence should he forwarded to this office. (c) This office he authorized to correspond direct with officials on the British side of the frontier. 4 . I am aware that at present there is a very indifferent and roundabout postal service uniting Kerman to British Baluchistan, hut I would urge that it is to our interest to consider at any rate whether it is not desirable to supply a Bam-Bobat link in conjunction with the Telegraph Department.

From— The Hon'ble Colonel Yate, C.S.I., C.M.G., Agent to the Governor-Gen eral in Baluchistan, To—L. W. Dane, Esq., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to your letter No. 2905 -K B., dated the 25 th July 1904, in which my opinion was invited regarding the desirability of co-operation between the British Authorities iu Baluchistan and his Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, in matters relating to Perso-Baluch border cases, I have the honour to forward a copy of letter* received from Major Showers, Politi- * No. 1719 , dated the 9th Augu 8 t 1904 . ^-o eil t&gt; Kalat, 0U the Subject. 2 . I am entirely in accord with Major Sykes’ remarks as to the desir ability of closer communication between himself and the Political Agent, Kalat, regarding matters in which they take a common interest, and Major Showers will be instructed to correspond freely with His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Kerman and to keep the latter informed of all matters affecting the Persian Border. Similar instructions will no doubt be issued to Major Sykes through the proper channel, and I would suggest that a printed copy of the Baluchistan Diary should be forwarded regularly to Major Sykes and to all Political Officers in the Persian Gulf direct from the Foreign Office. 2. As to the other suggestions contained in Major Sykes’s letter No. 170 , dated the 26th May 1904, I agree with Major Showers that it is undesirable to lay down any hard and fast rule prohibiting the direct correspondence of the Political Agent, Kalat, or his As&gt;Btants or the Nazim of Makran with the Persian border officials. It should be sufficient, I think, if the Kalafc offi cials keep the Consul at Kerman informed of any such correspondence that may occur and if important communications addressed to the Governor-Gene ral of Kerman are made through the Consul. As the Government of India t.ui. rn, letter No. 752.Z, dated the wth juoeiso.. aware -+ 1 have already instructed Major Showers to arrange the annual meeting between the ^azim of Makran and the Deputy Governor of Bampur by di rect correspondence with Major Sykes. VVhen a regular and expeditious postal service is established between Kerman and Baluchistan, it may be pos sible to arrange that all communications from our officials to the Persian border authorities should pass through the Consul at Kerman, but under pre sent conditions such a stipulation would be an absurdity, Jq the meantime I would ask that arrangements may be made for direct telegraphic communi cation between Quetta and Kerman via Kobat at reasonable rates. The wires have been linked up, but direct communication has not yet been established. , 4 I would invite attention to the remarks in Major Showers’ letter regard ing the policy of pressing for the payment of the instalments due from Sirdars Shah J eh an of Magas and Jiand Khan Damani, etc., I consider thnt the remission of a punishment which has been inflicted by a properly consti tuted authority womd only be interpreted as a confession of weakness, and would he unfair to the people of Kuntadar and other places who were robbed. I beg that the payment of the compensation awarded may be insisted upon to the uttermost farthing. ' * .,'m5 No. 1719, dated Quetta, the 9 th August 1904. From-MAJon H. L.

'nor- Y lthr ™ ce f t0 y T F ^ st Assistant s endorsement No. 1747-Z. of the 4th August 1904, forwarding for an expression of opinion certain nrono,uk made by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, I have the honour fo suv that I entirely agree with Major Sykes as to the desirab“ ation between Baluchistan Frontier officials and himself and as to the advantages that will accrue from such co-operation both generally in strengthening our positions in South-Eastern Persia and particularly in connection with the tram saction of current business along the Kerman-Baluchistan border. 2. That t'ie desired co-operation has hitherto been lacking is due, not to any intentional disregard of the Kerman Consulate, hut rather to the extremelv long time it takes for communications to reach or to be received from Kerman, to the fact that there has really been very little that could he communi cated from this side and partly to our being unaware that the Consul’s in fluence with the Persian authorities would extend to the affairs of places so distant from Kerman as the Baluchistan Border. Mv last letter from Major Sykes is dated the 30th April 1904 and it reached me in Quetta on the 11th June 1904. One of Major 1 hillott s letters took over two months on the way. Correspondence under these circumstances must naturally ke somewhat useless. However, this will be greatly remedied now that the telegraph will unite Kerman with Quetta, and I quite think the opportunity should be taken to establish more direct and regular communication between Kerman and Ealat than circumstances have hitherto permitted. 3. As mentioned above, there has not been much correspondence between Kalat and the Persian authorities. It has been confined in fact to a few com plimentary letters, to correspondence in connection with the annual meeting of the Nazim and Deputy Governor on the border, and to an occasional reminder on the subject of the Kej compensation, the whole being the natural out come of the various agreements come to between the Governor-General of Kerman and myself in 1902. 4. However, to turn to the details of the co-operation with the Kerman Consulate now to he inaugurated and the proposals made in paragraph 3 of Major Sykes’s letter No. 170 of the 26th May 1904 to the address of the Resident in the Persian Gulf, I would wish to observe that it hardly seems necessary to limit the correspondence of Baluchistan officers with Persian officials quite so strictly as the adoption of clauses (a) and (b) of the proposals would mean. In fact I deprecate the laying down of any hard and fast rule on this subject. The great distance of Kerman from the border, and as there is no telegraph in Makran, the entire absence of rapid means of communication with that place alone render it imperative I think that the discretion of Baluchistan officers in this matter should be left unimpaired. I agree, however, that as a general rule endeavours should be made to work through the Consul and that copies of official letters addressed to Persian officials on subjects likely to be referred to Kerman should ordinarily be furnished to the Consul. That the authority asked for in clause (&lt;?) be given I would certainly recommend. The proposed arrangement must of course be reciprocal. Extracts from the Consul’s diaries are already being sent me through your office and from this side I would pro pose to send Major Sykes extracts from the Nazim of Makran’s diaries and generally to keep him posted by wire or letter in such current events in Mak ran and along the border as may he worth communicating. 5. As to the proposal contained in paragraph 4 of Major Sykes’s letter No. 116 of the 7th April 1904 to the Resident, Persian Gulf, that we should not press for the payment of the instalments due to Kej from Shah Jehan of Magas and Jiand, Damani, Major Sykes is of course in a better position that I am to judge whether from a political point of view there is any objection to pressing the claims and whether the punishment meted out to the Baluchis has been— sufficiently severe to offer a reasonable hope of their leaving Kej alone for tbe future. But I cannot quite agree that Shah Jehan and his friends are deser ving of sympathy or that they did not richly merit all the punishment that fell upon them. I think too that some consideration is^ due to the Kej people who were certainly more sinned against than sinning in connection with Muhammad Umar’s raids and the compensation awarded whom was fixed upon by a combined Jirga from both sides in strict accordance with the rules and customs in force on the subject among the Baluch tribes of this border. 6 . Looking at the matter more generally too, I should have thought the continued pressing of the claims would be an advantage. When I consented to let part of the Kej claim stand over and be paid by instalments, J had in view this very object of obtaining a lever for future use. But the lever to be effective must be continually applied. With disuse it will lose its force and the people and the authorities will soon come to forget its existence. The revival of claims which we have allowed to remain more or less dormant may be then a matter of difficulty. The instalments extend over a good many years and there is no fear of the claim being suddenly discharged and the lever fall ing from our grasp. Thus I would urge that both in fairness to the Kej peo ple, who undoubtedly suffered very heavily in the raids and with the whole some object of keeping their late punishment and the power we still have over them fresh in our neighbour’s minds, we should insist on a portion, if not the whole, of the stipulated instalments being punctually paid. 1 I x r }conse tt t e j ^ ki u' kver ta'fe krce a D { No. 270, dated Bushire, the 20th August 1904.

I have much pleasure in announcing that His Highness the Zahir-u-Sultan has been appointed Governor of Baluchistan. The purchase price has, however, been raised from tomans 42,000, say, £8,000, to tomans 47,000, which bodes ill for the hapless Baluch. On the two occasions, on which I have met the new Governor-General of Kerman, I urged on His Highness the necessity of appointing a strong intelligent Governor, and stated that there were various candidates for the post whom I could not accept. The Governor-General is consequently entitled to some credit for selecting a man who is a personal friend of mine, and whose social and general status marks an advance even on the last appointment. 2. In this connection I would recall to your notice that, last year, the then Governor-General asked me to suggest a Khan for Governor, and I chose Vali Khan, who has fully justified the confidence I reposed in him. Previous to this the Governors were invariably ignorant and frequently illiterate : consequently the change from our point of view is one to he hailed with the utmost satisfaction. Perhaps, however, a still more important fact is the admission by two successive Governors-General that this Consulate should he consulted as regards this most important appointment. As soon as the appointment was confirmed, I wrote to both the Governor- General and the newly-appointed Governor that I proposed to ride in from Mahan and visit them. In reply, the latter informed me that, had I not been coming in to Kerman, he had intended to spend a night at Mahan with me, to be posted up in the various questions affecting Anglo-Persian interests. I would venture to point out that this intended visit is a proof that, apart from the Zahir-u-Sultan, the Governor-General is himself anxious to co-operate with me in improving Anglo-Persian frontier relations. 3. As the result of visiting the Governor-General, orders have been issued for re-garrisoning Irafshan—a matter of considerable importance and one on which much stress has been laid by the Govern- on each point discussed, His Highness was prepared Irafshan garrison — 1 officer. 30 sarbaz. ment of India: indeed, to accept my views. 4. Last winter there was no meeting on the frontier between British and Persian officials, mainly owing to the fact that no reference was made to this Consulate. I only heard through the Persian Governor that such a meeting was desired, and immediately pressed for it through Tehran ; but the instructions were received too late. I would consequently propose that I be informed, as soon as possible, whether such a meeting is desired during the coming winter, and, if so, when and where. I have spoken to the Governor-General on the subject, and he agrees that it is advisable both that such a meeting should take place and also that the cases against Hashim Khan, Sitvat-u-Mamalik (vide thy No. 169 of 1904), and other minor cases should be investigated on this occasion.2 It is hardly necessary to point out that it would he impolitic in tlie last degree for British Baluchistan to be represented at such a meeting by the Nazim of Makran, as the present Governor could not meet him as an equal, Baluchis rarely being allowed to sit before a Persian Governor. I would consequently suggest that, if the new frontier appointment be not established, a British Political Officer be specially deputed to meet His Highness, who will, if treated as a friend and entertained as a European, prove most obliging. If, however, he he treated on a strictly official footing, the results may be meagre. 5. Eor reasons given in my No. 170 of 1904, I hope that the question of the indemnities due by SardarsShah Jahan of Magas and Jiand Khan of Sarhad may not be referred to, except through me. In any case, the Zahir-u-Sultan has not authority to deal with this question, and, as I have already stated, press ing for the indemnities locally would be both useless and gives an appearance of vindictiveness to British policy, which is, I feel sure, not intended. I have formally mentioned the subject to the new Governor-General; but I have stated that, until I receive fresh instructions, I shall not press the question. 6 . In conclusion, Major Showers in 1901 and 1902 and Mr. Campbell in 1904 have settled numerous cases, and have enhanced British prestige in South- East Persia, and now that close co-operation between British officials on both sides of the frontier has been decided upon, our interests will, I anticipate, materially prosper. Einally, friendly frontier relations in distant Baluchistan will re-act on the British position throughout South-East Persia, and spread yet wider our deep- rooted political supremacy.

It is hardly necessary to point out that it would he impolitic in the last degree for British Baluchistan to he represented at such a meeting hy the Nazim of Mekran, as the present Governor could not meet him as an equal, Baluchis rarely being allowed to sit before a Persian Governor. I would consequently suggest that, if the new frontier appointment he not established, a British Political Officer he specially deputed to meet His Highness, who will, if treated as a friend and en tertained as an European, prove most obliging. If however he he treated on a strictly official footing the results may he meagre. 5. For reasons given in my 170 of 1904, I hope that the question of the indemnities due hy Sirdars Shall Jahan of Magas and Gland Khan of Sar- had may not he referred to except through me. In any case, the Zahir-u-Sultan has not authority to deal with this question and as I have already stated pressingpressing for the indemnities locally would he both useless and give an appearance of vindictiveness to British policy, which is, I feel sure, not intended. I have formally mentioned the subject to the new Governor General; but I have stated that until I re ceive fresh instructions, I shall not press the ques tion. 6. In conclusion, Major Showers in 1901 and 1902 and Mr. Campbell in 1904 have settled numerous cases and have enhanced British prestige in South east Persia and now that close co-operation between British Officials on both sides of the frontier has been decided upon, our Interests will, I anticipate, materially prosper. Finally friendly frontier relations in distant Baluchistan will react on the British position throu^i -out South-east Persia and spread yet wider our deep rooted political supremacy.

I hnye the honour to forward copy of a letter No. 41, dated the 2nd Feb ruary 1901, from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Kerman regarding affairs on the Perso-Baluch frontier. No. 44, dated the 2nd February 1904. From— Major P. M Sykes, C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, To— ajieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and His Britannic Majesty’s Acting Consul-General for Fars, Khuzistan, etc., Bushire. With respect to a note on the Perso-Baluch border by the Deputy Secre tary and other correspondence which reaches me from time to time, I propose to make a few remarks which may, I hope, prove useful. The first point is that under the existing system it is quite useless to expect the Persian Government to maintain garrisons at Irafshan or other posts on the border unless, indeed, the Customs officials are able to secure an escort for their employes. The Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan and the Political Agent, Kalat, have both made the excellent suggestions that Irafshan should be held by Persian troops. When I explain that the Bampur valley is mainly Government property, and that it is difficult to prevent desertions en masse from this their head-quarters, it will, I think, he realised how extremely difficult it would be for the Deputy Governor to maintain a garrison at Irafshan. It may he objected that Sarhad has occasionally been garrisoned and so why not Irafshan ? To this I would reply that Kwash, the capital of Sarhad, is supplied direct from Bam, and that, in spite of comparative proximity, the supply ques tion has proved almost insuperable. The suggestion about heavy guns for the frontier resulted in one gun reaching Kerman, where it has since remained. In short, however will ing the Persian authorities may be, their weakness is great, coupled with a grim determination not to spend one penny out of their own pockets. A second question is that of forts. I understand on good authority that the Magas fort, for instance, is practi cally indestructible and that, even after 400 lbs. of gun-cotton had been ex pended on it, could be and has been easily rebuilt. The fact we have to face is that, in Baluchistan, a fort is very speedily and very easily constructed and that, with the chronic weakness of Persian rule, they generally will be rebuilt. At the same time such infringements of an agreement are not without advan tage, and furnish pressure levers. A third point is that no Governor-General knows or cares what his predecessors did or agreed to, whereas that predecessor is careful to burn or destroy any papers that might prove useful to the man who has supplanted him. This phase of affairs, too, has its advantages-continuity being on the side of His Majesty’s Government. In this connection the annual meeting on the frontier should, I would urge, be arranged through this Consulate, as I hare suggested in a previous letter. The Governor of Baluchistan, unless he happens to be tax-collecting in the neighbourhood, cannot obtain travelling expenses unless Tehran specially orders his journey to the annual meeting. Consequent ly, if I were informed in good time of the arrangements desired to be made by the officials on the Baluchistan side of the frontier, I could co-operate with effect.The present arrangement, in my humble opinion, is undesirable as betray ing a lack of co-operation between two officials, both of whom are now scrying directly under the Government of India.

I concur with Major Showers in his opinion that we should continue to press the Persian Government to act up to the agreement come to, and that on no account should we, by our silence or in any other way, acquiesce in the withdrawal of the Persian garrison from Irafshan or from the other places such as Bampusht, Kwash or Dizak, which the Persians agreed to occupy. Should the Persian Government prove unable or fail to act up to their under taking in this particular, they should he distinctly held responsible for their failure. I also agree with Major Showers in the remarks which he makes oa the subject of the Magas fort, and I trust that the responsibility for any con sequences of their action in permitting the rebuilding of the fort will be at. once brought home to the Persian authorities. 3. I approve the suggestion that the annual meeting between the Deputy Govemor of Bampur and the Jsazim of Makran should be arranged through the Consul of Harman, and Major Showers will be directed to correspond with Major Sykes on the subject.

General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan. t a f-v.reference to your Pirst Assistant’s endorsement No. 2871, of the v tt- f0 ™ ardir ^ ^ or expression of opinion, certain remarks made by IPs Britannic Majesty s Consul at Karman, I have the honour to reply as follows to the various points raised,Pirst as to the garrisoning of the Irafshan fort. Service in a place like Irafshan mast no doubt be extremely unpopular with Persian troops, and the Karman authorities would of course be glad to be quit of the responsibility of furnishing the garrison. But in view of the great importance of bolding this isolated and lawless locality, I am of opinion that we should continue to press the Persian Government to act up to the agreement come to. At all events, we certainly should not acquiesce in the withdrawal of the garrison, as we thereby discard the advantage we shall have in holding Persia responsible* for the consequences that may ensue on the outbreak of any further lawless ness of this border. But before we fall back on mere passive dissent from the withdrawal, I would urge the advisability of our suggesting to the Persian authorities certain alternative plans by adopting one of which they might see a means of maintaining control over Irafshan. When troops were located at this place it was proposed to garrison other places also, e.g., the populous centre of Dizak. If this were to be done and Irafshan were only one of several posts in Eastern Persia, the objections the troops have to the place would largely disappear, especially so if the men were relieved from time to time from the larger Dizak garrison, or, if this is too big a venture for the Persians to undertake and only Irafshan can be considered, would it not be possible to arrange for the relief of the garrison every 4 or 6 months by a fresh detachment ? This would reconcile the man to the service, and it would have Ihe advantage of keeping parties of troops frequently on the move through the country. Bailing all else, will the Persian Government consent to the Nazim of Makran’s locating half a dozen of his border levies in Irafshan, so that he may at all events be kept informed of current events and receive early intimation of impending mischief ? Irafshan is, from its position and inacces sibility, so well suited to be the refuge and resort of lawless characters, and has been so often used as such in the past, that we have, I think, a right to demand of Persia that she either hold the district herself or acquiesce in our taking some such steps as proposed above in order to secure the peace of the border and to protect the lives and property of British subjects. The' district has been restored by the Deputy Governor to Mir Azam Khan and with him it might remain should the present proposal be carried out. With some one on behalf of the Nazim on the spot to keep an eye on his proceedings, Azam Khan would be likely not only to be careful of his own behaviour, hut also to see that no mischief was hatched in and set on foot from his district. With regard to the big gun that has arrived at Karman, I should say the Governor-General would be w r ell advised to send it on to Bampur where the very fact of its presence would have a useful effect on the demeanour of persons who set store by the strength of their forts and defy the Deputy Governor’s authority. Next as to the rebuilding of Magas fort by Sardar Shah Jehan. It is quite true that the fort was not completely destroyed by my party in 1902, but the massive walls of the main structure were so fractured and shaken as to render it uns afe for occupation and incapable of defence. In the two years that have elapsed since then, the walls have no doubt settled down, and either in whole or in part they have been worked into the new fort now erected. This latter is the main ] omt, viz., that with the connivance, if not the permission, of the Deputy Governor this wild and turbulent Sirdar is now once more in possession of a stronghold, and I shall be much mistaken if the result is not to start him, before very long, on a fresh course of rebellion against his own Government, and of aggression against the subjects of Kej-Makran. Even as I write, come reports of bis having carried off &amp;0 camels belonging to Mir Kia Khan, Keki of Lad^asht (British territorv), which were grazing, as is customary, in Persian territory. The Kekis assisted by the Dizak Chiefs went in pursuit, and 69 camels were recovered. The remaining 11 however were kept by Shah Jehan. It is also reported that Muhammad Umar, Naushirwani, lately sent him presents, and that in return he is collecting and despatching some bieech-loading rifles to Muhammad Umar. At the time of my visit, the man was completely crushed, and it is greatly to be regretted that the Persian authorities are allow ing him to lift his head once more after having got their heel so firmly upon 3wmm it. Weak as Persian authority is in Eastern Persia, it was strong enough to cope with Shah Jehan as we left him in January 1902, and here too, as in the case of Irafshan, I do not think we can admit that the Persians'have valid reasons for failing to carry out the arrangements made in 1902. Ear from it indeed, it seems most necessary that the fact of their responsibility for the con sequences of such failure should be clearly placed before them. Major Sykes’ suggestion that the annual meeting between the Deputy Governor of Dampur and the Nazim of Makran should be arranged for through himself seems an excellent one, and it offers probably the only means bv which we shall be able to secure the regular and punctual attendance of the Deputv Governor at the place of meeting. The meeting duly came off last vear but it fell through this year by the Deputy Governor’s default. He was' at Ivasar- kand, Charbar, etc., and he premised to come on to Peshin, but he did not do so. Thus we must look forward to the meeting in January next, and I would sug gest that the Consul at Karman should commence at once to put the arrange ments in train. ~ ® ✓ * \, I No. 2580-F. B. From L.

I have the honour to be, Sib, Your most obedient, humble servant, E. M. GRANT DUPE. The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. Tehran, October 20 th, 1903. (Copy). Your Excellency, It will be no doubt within the recollection of Your Excellency that I have on various occasions, by the direction of the Government of India, urged the advisability of retaining a considerable force of Persian troops on the frontier between British and Persian Baluchistan. At the beginning of last year Your Excellency informed me that you had agreed to give effect to the proposal of the Governor-General of Kerman to station troops at Irafshan and other points on the frontier. It now appears from information which I have received from the Govern ment of India, that the Persian Garrison has been withdrawn from Irafshan, and that both the fort and district have been transferred to the former owner, Mir Azim Khan. This step, if it really has been taken, is, I venture to submit to Your Excellency, regrettable, since it involves the risk that the Irafshan Port and District may once more become the haunt of lawless bands, and that the peace of the border may again be disturbed, and military operations for its restoration become necessary. I would accordingly urge on Your Excellency the advisability of retaining the Persian Garrison at Irafshan in the interests of both Governments, and in accordance with the arrangements which were made last year. I feel convinced that the maintenance of a Persian force on the frontier of Baluchistan, sufficient to vindicate at any moment the authority of His Majesty the Shah, is required both by the interests and by the dignity of the Persian Government, and will prove in the long run an economy, as it will guarantee the Persian frontier districts against disorders, the suppression of which may prove more costly than the maintenance of a preventive force. I avail, etc., His Excellency The Mushir-ed-Dowleh, etc., etc., etc.Tehran, December 3rd, 1903. (Translation.) on the borders of Kerman and Baluchistan, I have the honour to inform you that orders have been sent to the local authorities to take necessary steps for f that purpose.
