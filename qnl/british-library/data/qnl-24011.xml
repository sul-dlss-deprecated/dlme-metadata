For your information plead 10/11/37 SH e. f A BAGHDAD DJ_A_RY We much regret to announce that there was a Royal Air Force disaster in the Persian Gulf on Saturday in which three members of the Service lost their lives— Wing Commander A. R. M. Rickards, o.b.e., a.f.o., Pilot Officer Kenneth S. Batchelor, and Aircraftman O’Leary. The aero plane in which they were travelling was one of three engaged in a flight along the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf for the inspection of landing grounds. Although the information received in Baghdad is not yet complete, it is believed that the aeroplane carrying Wing. Comdr. Rickards (piloted by P/O. Batchelor) overturned while coming down on the Khor Gharim landing ground near Sharkh, about 150 miles south-east of Muscat. One of the accompanying machines remains at the scene of the disaster, and an R.A.F. party have left Iraq by air to recover the bodies and obtain evidence for a court of enquiry. * * » * * * Wing Commander Rickards was an Arabic scholar who had built up a considerable reputation in recent years by his work as an intelligence officer in the Aden Command. Latterly, as R.A.F. Liaison Officer in the Persian Gulf, with headquarters at Bahrain, he was doing valuable work keeping in touch with the tribal leaders on the Arabian coast. Many of our readers in Baghdad will remember him as a popular Commanding Officer of 55 Squadron in 1931-33. • • * * V • The young officer who lost his life in the R.A.F. crash at Khor Gharim on Saturday was Pilot Officer R.H. McClatchey — not as reported in yesterday’s “Iraq Times.”I I Cutting from thf xraq Times of Baghdad No.7774 dated 27/10/37 r Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British rAmbassador in Iraq, was received by his Majesty King George at Buckingham Palace on October 16th.
