The matter rested with which v ou enclosed a copy of 2, Rumbold’s letter however did mention the possibility that no programmes will be required for the second half of 1946, and I should be grateful if you would let me know whether the developments of the past 'three months' have altered the situation and whether it is now possible to say definitely whether programmes will or will not be required. It will of course be easy enough fo 1 '- us to draw up programmes on the rough and ready basis which you. suggested merely showing kx the total tonnage for each area* with separate mention only of items of 1,000 tons or more or* of items requiring special loading arrangements, but it seems very doubtful whether such programmes would b^ of any real use. 3.

The Ministry will therefore still need su-l f icieni?^ informetion to enable them to direct tramp vessels and to advise the lines as to the extent of the services reau- ired. Thus for each loading ^rea they will want to know (a) the total tonnage o^ general cargo which would be carried by liner services.

Both in Oases' of/ fir \ A. a (h) and (b) an estimate of.the tonnage which can be '' ' lifted in ;coastal or indiahs .registered shipping. It is appreciated that with the relaxation of import controls and the reduction in'the number of items subject to combined planning any estimates provided will necessarily be . little'Wre than “intelligent anticipation' and they will be / accepted on-that basis* During the change-over from controlled to commercial operation^ and in view of the reduced shipping . no”* available as compared with the pre-war period the.

Pro gress has, however, been slpw. and .it is understood there is little likelihood, of.any plan being finalised for'some time. As the Government of India.are aware, item of capital plant and equipment are being* obtained as reparations from Germany under the advance delivery scheme by those countries entitled to them. As regards supplies from Germany current production and stocks, any requirements which the N Goveitnment of Irr&amp;ia„.may ; de.sireto have specially considered could be ndtified to the Control authorities in Germany through the London Cohtrol Office for Germany and Austria. It would thus be possible to ascertain whether the goods'Utf ( 2 ) in question, ^/ere in fact .available'. Any exports-from Germany from currSnt production r/ould'have to.be paid for in dollars. It is understood that it is unlikely 'that any large.,quan- tities'of goods will be available for export from Germany for some time - more'especially since at the moment coal is only supplied to the. most'; essential industries and transport facilit ies in Germany are limited. q As German dyestuffs might -be of special interest to Indian importers,•an.enquiry was made whether there was, any likelihood of supplies from the British Zone. It is understood, however, that dyestuffs 'are in rather short supply in the British zone in Germany. The Control Office has stated.^ however, that if a list can be furnished of India’s most urgent requirements specifying types and quantities, it will be transmitted to the British Element of the Control Commission for/investigation whether these supplies can be obtained.

Sir, I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with your telegram No*10758 dated the 15th May 1945 on the subject mentioned above and to enclose herewith a statement furnishing the best possi ble estimate of our total requirements from Germany for civil pur poses for a period of two years after her surrender. In arriving at the figures shown in the attached statement allowance has been made for existing and prospective indigenous productive capacity. No special account has, however, been taken of the possibility of some of these items being obtained from Germany on a reparation basis. The estimates, therefore, merely represent a broad overall picture of our possible requirements from Germany for the next two yeara as we see these at present. I am, however, to add that the figure shown in the statement forwarded herewith are intended .only to serve as a basis for discussions and should not in any way at this stage be con strued as representing firm estimates of our requirements. The Government of India may therefore kindly be consulted before any action is taken either to procure or to ship any individual items against these estimates. Such prior consultation would appear to be all the more necessary as, in accordance with paragraph 3(f) of your telegram 4417 dated the 25th February 1945, private traders or non-Government circles have not been consulted in the framing of these estimates.
