Leachc/an n^w fully occupied on important work in Mosul Wilayat whence I cannot withdraw him without detriment to important interests. In any case in altered circumstances do not think despatch of any officer to Ibn baud necessary at present. Ibn Rashid has apparently made peace with both parties and situation may be allowed develop naturally. Meanwhile Ibn Saud will continue receive his regular subsidy of £.5000/- monthly. Am informing him of final defeat of our common enemies and expressing pious hope that Arabian problem will reach mutually satisfactory solution. Am also sending him copy Anglo-French Declaration of November 8th. / He cannot fail to interpret latter as reaffirming resolution Allies allow Arab communities including Najd elements determine V k their own destinies. In these circumstances while fully aware of X the far greater difficulties confronting H.M.G. in Hejaz and Pales tine and Syria compared with our local problems in Persian Gulf and Najd, Mesopotamia and Kurdistan, I am of opinion that persistence of Shariff in matter of Khurraa may not only precipitate actual hostilities but shake Ibn Saud’s faith in honesty of British inten—« tions. Matter therefore calls for careful considration in relation to our general Arab policy. P v ilby has written fullYsport on Najd Missions work of s past year. Would accordingly propose depute him visit Cairo discus matter with High Commissioner on my behalf after which he will proceed home on leave.

Nigh Commiseioner Cairo telegram to foreign Office 1765 November 2Tth. °hi 1 by coiraiiente from T&gt;asrah as follows: Bfgins. Firstly. Ibn Saud’s complaints regarding Sharif’s persistent aggression against hhurma have rrrained unheeded. Sharif’s policy has steadily alienated sympathies of all Badawin elements. In circumstances it is inevitable Ibn Saud will receive great accession strength when Sharif ceases to pay Badawin mercenaries.\ 4 ; ii fG &gt;econdly # cir’8 ad’ iaaion of fo irth unsuccessful attack Khurma will not improve matters* Thirdly, reier^nce Sharif’s alleged or lore to &gt;},akir to hvoii bloodnhed yesterday. I iiave po-ted literal tr;&lt;r lP i^ i i 0 n letter of Oar if to phakir dated about firot September and apparently captured with booty at third defeat. Sharif in letter boasts of having returned Ibn Saud’s letter unopened find/y^vine threatened latter’s messenger. vr r . adds “if y *u capture &gt;'hurma don’t go beyond it until fully consolidated and be very careful &gt;f the guns’*. ^ Fane of letter does not suggest anxiety ^void bloodslied. fourthly, as you know I regard eventual conflict as inevitable if oharif purauaa resent policy and T • .0. decline intervene. Personally T regard issue as doubtful while conse- quencee Ibn Claud’s success would be far reaching. .fifthly, it seems to me that only possible chance sv^rting disas er is either that Ti«i/,G. should intervene to prohibit Sharif from further aggression pending arbitration by boundary commiasiorJor that Sharif or P.l.G. should accord definite recog nition of Ibn Gaud’s suzerainty over hhurma. Tither course would fully satisfy Ibn 3aud: If Shakir remains manoeuvring round hurma, Ibn Gaud cannot long maintain pa tience. Tnds, Addressed 3. of S. for India repeated Cairo and India.

Referring to Baghdad telegram of November 29th to Sectretary of State for India. It ifi reported by the King of Medjae that chief supply base of SHAKDR at DOHADJAK has been plundered by IkHT AN. DDHA1AJAH is some 45 miles north of TA1P. iuch booty and food to the extent of 400 sacks has been captured. King of HFDJA2 at* tes this incident oecuring near Capital will make situation ciltical unless ultimatum bed sent to BIN SAUD by British Ooverniaent to effect that gatherings of Inif AN at IENTKY ARTAW1CH OHUTOHOT and Yh THUN be di«)&gt;ersed within 35 days. ATLliiA should be prevented from comuimicating to these places. It will mean that he will have to abdicate if Govern lent is unable to give him lie Ip. In commenting on above Colonel Wilson thinks that the activity of Ikhwan is increasing anti as referred to in my tele gram 1765 the sending of reinforcements suggests that Bin baud is behind this movement. This is only one of several such indi cations . Referring to iemorandum which was enclosed in ?y des*&gt;ateh No.39 dated May 7th he calls attention to his opinions expressed therein and submite that it is time that British Government adopted a policy of suzerainty favouring King HUSSEIN and send a request to BIN BAUD that IKir AN troops be at once withdrawn from KHURMA and its neighbourhood. Colonel Wilson thinks that the ing's fear of the increase of WAHAB11R influence in HHDJAZ is well founded and also that on the fall of Sfedinah BIN SALT? will proceed with his troops to KHURMA. - He therefore thinks that Military opposition-2- € opposition against IKHT^AN IS justifiable in view of daggers to King’s prestige and peace of HLDJAZ. It appears that a collision is faminent between WAHABIS / w.» and SHHiIFFIi)J|Sj as tension between these parties is increasing. p or reasons of political expediency we urust give King Hussein support, as arbitration at this juncture is not likely to succeed. In addressing BIN BAUD we could inform him that diplomatic support of British Government was given to Kings claim to priority, without prejudicing territorial rights of other Arab chiefs , and thus might pursuade BIN SAID that he would not take the field in person. The king hearing that this announceiaent hag been made to his rival might be induced to exercise further patience. Addressed to Foreign Office and Baghdad.

I thank your honour for all that and request you to cable at the earliest opportunity which should be w I beg to inform you that I previously reported to you about the preparations of Sharif*s sons for an expedition according to their movement ,and I received a commimication from you of the reply from your great Government that there was no reality in the matter and that they were engaged in their internal affairs. I was wrong in my view and found your reply to be trucks was proved by further information. In the meantime I received letters from Abdullah giving us the good news of occupation of Medina and I sent him a good reply and also to his father,Sharif Husain. Ve hoped that it would a basis for union between us and for tran quillity and reform of the Arab affairs and in confirmity with the wishes of my friend H.M. Government. Afterwards I received Sharif news of the departure of^Abdullah from Medina and that he was prepared for movement against the tribes of Rajd. I left the matter till it should be ascertained,and now it has been ascertained. I wish to communicate it to you in order that firstly I may not be responsible secondly that you may have opportunity to see that there is no movement against the wishes of your Government. As regards his departure from Medina - he left with the remaining Turkish troops together with men from the neighbourhopd of Medina and from different parts of Hejaz. Sharif Husain has left Mecca and is encamped. Abdullah has joined him. I understand that they are fully equipped with field guns, machine guns and military preparation. I pray God to help us against their hostile intentions and to help against ctggressor. Certain intrfues and movements for which there is no room. ’’Tien Ha jdNajd people heard they were in excited rtate _ not an account of infiriority or fear but on the contrary as a precaution against their previous and recent deeds. I am warning the iiajdis and now matt rs have reached their extreme. When the British Govennment v. T as engaged in time of war we had left matters and given up many of our rights but now I cannot excuse the British Government. If the ' harif is obedient to orders of your Government and follows them,then I am prepared to entrust the settlement of dispute betweB us to you under the necessary rights which was as clear as the run. So I hope that you will settle by arbitration between us with justice. If /he is the aggressor you can stop him,If I am the aggressor you can stop me and place responsibility or whoever acts contrary to order and commits aggression after the settlement &lt; of the dispute. An what has encouraged me to authorise you is two things, lir tly,God willing,! am guarding myself against aggressio and fully believing in my rights which are known to every one, before as now. And the second thing is that I put my trust in God and then in you and your justice that there will be no un pleasant consequences according to what you promised me which is the characteristic of your Government. If it is that Sharif is out of your hands and he has no willingness to follow your advice and you give me a definite reply then I will defend ray tribes and my rights and responsibility will be on the disobedient; at once on seeing the excitement amongest the people in Najd, I was afraid lest a breach may be committed and I went out around my towns to quiet the inhabitants and to prevent aggressive acts except if the Sharif himself commits aggressions on the frontier of 1&gt;l ajd we cannot excuse ourselves from protecting our sacred rights and our homes. Thus according to my love for good and ray hatred of trouble and following your wishes I have hastened this communication and hope to receive immediate reply. If the Gharif is ready to comply with order he should remain in his town and I shall do the same and the matter should be submitted to you for your views and if he rew. mains vhere he is then undoubtedly matters will be azrrd^ated nnd17^6 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 28th April 1919.

This name is that commonly used by Arabs to describe the Islands of Jinna and Musalamiyah shown on the charts. The Islands lie nearly due East of Anta*a and in a sheltered bay which is resorted to by all the Kuwait pearling boaos. In fact this bay may be considered the ne^d-quarters of the Kuwait pearling fleet during t-he diving season- It is noz resorted to by Bahrain and other divers and though Bahrain and Darin are the actual markets for pearl dealers the Kuwait boa os use Jinna and fusalamiyah as their main orovisioning base- There are wel^s with huos on both ♦ islands and the spot is in frequent touch with Anua’a which is some 2 days’ march distant. The inhabitants are fishermen in the winter and collect firewood Ipfrom the mainland for sale to the pearl-boats during the diving season. During the season they Mbshs become pearlers. The pearling community have always regarded these • » islands as within Mubarak’s jurisdiction until the arrival of the % TurKiish posts in 1902 of which I observe in passing one only is now located on Jinna and c ons its of three men.

At the outset this movement was hostile to the Sheriff and for this reason it was encouraged by Bin Saud* After spreading round Ryadh, an Akhttan colony attempted to establish itself in Hail, but Bin Rashid would not allow it to settle down in his territory, and he has ever since followed the same policy, with the result that excepting in one sub tribe situated on his border there are no Akhuan Sectarians among his tribes. The Akhuan movement has made rapid progress and all Bin Sand's tribes are tainted with it; the l^uteyr the Ataiba and the Narb count large numbers of adherents, the Lawasir and hbay a much lesser number. Faisal ben Dawash Sheikh of the riuteyr is the leading spirit of the sect. The tom of Koweit is very gradually joining the movement r&gt;nd its Sheikh Salim if not actually n *Akh* is cowed by fear into obeying the commands of Faisal. In Zubair Akhuan 'r* appearing in gradually increasing numbers to the Alarm of Sheikh Ibrahim although their ardour, so far from the centre of the movement, is for the present rather tepid. L f any .a BaduVhen entering iubair to buy his supplies boasts that he has joined the new sect. The Akhuan although fostered at the start by Ben Baud have grown go much, that they have passed beyond his control and the general idea among the tribes is that Ben Saud will either disappear or else be forced to follow the movement even thou^i it is directed against us. for his lack of religious fervour find especailly for daeling the past. ;Vhen the Akhuan movement actually started is not Rydh. Like all newly formed sects it is animated with a very It is reported that the Akhuan reproached Bben Baudwith the British GrO?emment, and the answer he is supposed to ha?e given shows how weak his position is *1 have been obliged, said he, to side with the British in order to strengthen my own position, but later on, should the British giva you c;Ui8e for rising against them, I will be with you*. Ben Bash id* s messengers say, that had not tne Sheriff assured himself of Ben Bashid^ help he would have been attacked by now. The Sheriff as a result of this alliance has been supplying foodstuffs to the &amp;a*er - and has lately risked him for 2,000 camels, which are being supplied. The Ajman believe that the first Akhuan attack till be directed against Iraq, others believe that the Sheriff will be the first objective. There has just been an outburst of okhu&amp;n fanatacism in amongst the Muteyr. Faisal tneir chief with tha tiuteyr Akhuan invited all non Akhuan to join the Sect on penalty of death, and he actually killed 4 Muteyr tribesmen who refused his invitation. This created a stampece; part oi the duteyr fleeing to Koweit and Bahrein for safety and others going over to sben Rashid to claim his protection. Thirty four Ajman raiders who found the &amp;ubcyr too strong for them were forced to surrender, and their surrender was accepted by the ^uteyr {'attohom weijahour - they showed their faces). According to the rules of the t* after handing over their rifles the Ajman should have been allowed to depart. However they were taxed with being bod uonamaadens ■Kaffars' and with being friendly with the British; and they were there and then put to death. The fear of the Akhuan is spre&amp;uiiig ano the Aalsm under Chari ben Towala and the Dhafir under Kamood al Suwait are feeling anxious. The feeling of uneasiness has spread to the Marshes and Bayed Jaber remarked to me that the Akhuan would gladly exterminate the Maadans if they had the chance. Sheikh Ibrahim of Zubair says measures ought to be taken at once to counteract this movement adding 'Trouble is brewing and unless you forestall it, all your policy inCfutrul rdll be upe«t and tilt Akhuan will soon apptar befjre Iraq 11 . He added that Kben lAshid was tht rallying point of tt»os« tri'teo oppoeec to the Akhuan and that it would be tile for us to cout to an understariaing with nim ard use him *iid his tribes as buffers between Iraq and the Akhuans. One of the Akhuan in battle is worth xiTe d&lt;ada8 for he is prepared to give up his life for the ''cause * (Sa31*woo nafsoltOM lei m5t). (dDj 3 . 2 '. I&lt;A13ii40, Captain. Asstt. Politioal Officer, oasrah.NOTE ON THE IKHVUN. There has been much talk in Basrah recently on the subject of the Ikhwan and it may be well to make a short survey of the position. Mr Philbv has no doubt dealt exhaustively with the subject b t his writings are not available and we may glance at the history of the movement before touching on its present activities. We read that Mohammed ibn Abd el Wahab was born in Nejd ab~ out 1696 and that hr wns educated at Basrah and Daiasoua.He was the founder of the ascetic cvoed styled Wahabism. Mohammed ibn Baud,Sheikh of Deriyah, of the ancient house that now has its seat at Riyadh,became a convert and began to impose the new cult by forve or arms on Eejd about the middle of the eighteenth century. The movement progressed and in 1801 the Wahabis under Bin Sa d sacked Kerbala and in 1802 Mecca surrendered to them. By 1^04 all Arabia acknowledged Wahabi supremacy. In the middle of the nineteenth century the cult had fallen to decay and the radius of its action from its home in Nejd became very s iall. At the present time Wahabism is all powerful in Nejd. In Jebel Shammar f Hail and the surrounding villages are Wahabi but the Shararaar tribes are described as less fanatical than the people of the towns. All writers dwell on the possibility and danger of a Wahabi revival, and Sir Reginald Wi igate has recently remarked on the importance of the maintenance of Bin Baud 1 s Anglophile sentiments. It is to be borne in mind that the origin of the Wahabi movement probably lay in the Christia- advance in India, and in the interference of Christian powers with Moslem shipping and with Moslem rulers in the East, as was the Senussi movement in Africa a result of Christian en croachment in Egypt. The encroachment of a Christian Power through the occupation of 'Iraq provides again a similar impel to religious militancy on the part of the Arabs of the desert. Within the last dozen years has sprung up within the Wahal clans a revivelist movement. T ere wes formed a brotherhood of reformers styled the Akhwan. This fraternity has grown in numbers. It is Wahabi in creed but does not comprise all Wahabis.\ (^) * ^ The Akhwan are mostly of Bln Sand’s tribes, the Muteyr, t 7 Ataiba and Harb tribes providing large numbers, the Dawasir and Subai a lesser contribution. There are no Akhwan in the ex-Hasa tribe,the Ajraan. Among the Shammar it is only fron one sub—tribe the society has found any Tembers. The movement is however now diking rapid headway and exciting much attention. It is reported tb*t the Sheikh of Koweit,wh is declared to be one of the brotherhood,recently received a curt demand that he should purge his town of disreputable persons such as araq sellers e c, and that he complied. And the story goes that Sheikh Khazzal who is staying at Koweit at once commented with some humour on Salims aeti n by filling his house with dancing girls and others of thin morality. It is generality believed that the Akhwan has grown too powerful for Bin Saud. He fostered the movement to ^ strengthen his position against the Sheriff but it has gone beyon his control. Bin Saud is considered lax in his religion and hostility has been evinced to his Policy in resnect of the British Government. It is reported that the Akhwan reproached him openly in this mat er and that his answer wos 0 the effect that he had been obliged to act thus to strengthen his position but that if the British caused the Akhwan to rise against them he would side with them ( he AKhwan). Bin Saud must encourage the Akhwan for his own personal safety as well as for aggression pgainst the Sheriff and defence against agression by the Sh ri f. (In this connection it is to be noted that Ibn Bashid has be^n receiving supplies from the Sheriff and that the Sheriff has recently asked Ibn Rashid for 2,000 camels,1,000 of which have actually been sent. Sheikh Salim of Koweit is on good terms with Ibn Bashid and lias been supplying him with provisions). The Akhwan are not considered to be likely to become immedia ely dangerous, but the movement is growing and is one which eoul now be used for political purposes against the British Governmen Disaffection in Indie might conceivably use this weapon and any displ'ty of weakness in the Government of 'Iraq would invite c trouble from this quarter. Signed* A.S. Meek. Major. M.G.&amp;*F.0. Basrah. Pur her Note . The Sheikh of Zobeir tells me that while the Akhwan are j(3). regarded and believe themselves t be a spiritual brofherhoo the force behind it is T1 eisal ibn Darwesh Sheikh of the Mute} Tribe. This Sheikh, according to my informant, hopes eventual, to oust Bin Saud from his Lordship in Nejd and hisaspirations may go much further than that. It is interesting in this connec tion to note the contention of some that in the trouble last year between the Mutyyr and Ajraan the influence brought to tear on Philby in Hiyadh oh behalf of the former led to the unjust treab- iflent of the Ajman by Government• This will be discussed hereafter. # Signed.

It is known to you that when the Sharif took edina I informed the Great Government that he intends movements and means to send one of his sons towards my territory* But then when I received a communication from H.LPs Sovern- ment purporting that the matter had no truth we accepted it as true* .And then took place the late movements of the Sharif and thank God,’Vho is the best protector* And in these days I have received reliable information that a delegate of the Sharif went to Ibn Rashid and a meeting took place which was attended by headmen of the Shammar and Zaidan together with bin Hithlin and other notables of •Ajnan. The object of the meeting was that the Sharif has asked help of Ibn Rashid and that he intends to come to an agreement with Ibn Rashid so that he and Shammar and •Ajman should fight me and he (Sharif) has undertaken to pay T £ 50,000/- to Ibn Rashid and supply arms and also allowances for tribal headmen* flow as regards this parley,it is true beyond doubt,but as regards their final determination to do any thing,I havenot received authentic information which,however, io bound to reach ue, ineha Allah. as regards ibn Rashid, peace and treaty obligation exist between him and myself, if he remains true, .,od be praised, but if he commits a breach, then he will fall down, and I do not attach any importance to him.

The reason why I submit their matter,that is^Ibn Rashid’s and the others’, is that 1 regard it as ray duty to inform His Majesty's Govern ment of what interests and affects me* but the object, the whole' object 4*6 the Sharif ( ^ attitude) If the affair concerned only him and myself, then i should regard it extremely light, but my aim is to follow the wishea of His Majesty the Ring and to abide by the understanding between me and Hia Majesty’s Government and because I am afraid any movements may t ike place from his side or on account of o-useS oreat d by him and the reanonsibility may on me for not informing His Majesty's Government* i# therefore* request you to communicate ,this) to the hon'ble Civil Commissioner, baghdad,for submitting to His majesty the King: that 1 may either be given a complete guaran tee regarding the Sharif that no movement whatever shall take olace from his side until the question pending between him and myself is finally settled through your Government, be it after a month or ten years* or else,1 may be given an answer so that 1 may look after my own affairs and be prep-red in order that I may not be responsible if any thing happens by tHe will of God, as the result of any movement eto. I send this communication because X am oe -tain about the movements of the Sharif which are many, some of which may gain their object and others may fail- 1 have, therefore / (to inform ) before any thing happens so that 1 may remain easy in nind,protect my country and my subjects and be free from any^thing • in the way of remonstrance or reproach corinr on me -from the side of His ajeaty’o governmenti now request you to oonvey the above speedily, and to aak for early reply, for at present there is great oommotion (in nejd) while I have been holding back the inhabitants of i&lt;ajd, and treating (adverse; reports as false. And, God willing, neither I nor any of my tribesmen will make any movement till 1 reoeive a reply from Government unless we are attacked in our own homes when we oannot forbear. And I assure you that I love to be at peace with all, and especially, with the Jharif, except in a matter in which there is no helping and no alternative, then God’s will be done.

STHE KHURMA DISPUTE BETWEEN KING HUSSEIN AND IBN SAUD. BY CAPTAIN N. GARLAND, ARAB BUREAU. Ibn Saud .—In 1915 a Treaty was arranged between Emir Ibn Saud and His Britannic Majesty’s Government, in which the latter recognized Ibn Saud as the independent sovereign of Nejd, Ei Hasa, Qatif and Jubail. It was a temporary agreement made chiefly for reasons of military expediencv after the expulsion of the Turks, and no definite boundaries of the territory were specified. - 7M?67m—Although generally regarded as a new creation, the Ikhwan or brotherhood movement, is really a revival in an intensified form of Wahabism’ the great puritanical revolt against orthodox Mohammedanism in the eighteenth century which was ultimately crushed by the Egyptian troops under Mohammed Aly in 1817, and which, since then, has existed in a merely moribund state chiefly within the confines of Nejd. The tenets of the Ikhwan creed are very similar to those of Wahabism, though its followers are without doubt more fanatical. To the non-Moslem,’ however, it is the brutal methods of effecting conversions and of punishing sinners, rather than the principles of the creed itself, that appear objectionable There is no doubt whatever that the Bedouin are systematically terrorised into conversion and that those who refuse are done to death. In war the Ikhwan are said to take no prisoners but to cut the throats of all who fall into their hands. It has been stated repeatedly that Ibn Saud had no connection with the IkliTvan movement in its early stages, and this is probably true, but it is now sufficient for our present purposes to know : firstly, that the sect originated close by his own capital and was allowed to flourish there, and its readin°- missionaries are his own subjects; secondly, that it is merely a desperately fanatical edition of Wahabism of which he is the acknowledged leader; and thirdly, that Ibn Saud has recently put himself at the head of the movement and will certainly not fail to use it for furthering his own ends. Eor the purposes of this review, therefore, it is unnecessary to differentiate between Ibn Saud and the Ikhw r an or between the latter and the Wahabis. Since the first appearance of the Ikhwan, about 10 years ago, in the vicinity of the Nejd capital,'Riadh, it has made rapid progress.’ It is practically ceitain that the whole of ^Nejd is Ikhwan and its missionaries have penetrated to all the corners of Arabia. But its doctrines are detested by all orthodox Moslems and the rulers of the Arab States surrounding Nejd (especially King Hussein) live in constant dread of its spread to their people. Khurma Dispute.—Ths present jKhurma crisis has two causes : one religious, the other political. The religious cause is the King’s determination to stop Ikhwan sectarian propaganda in the Hejaz : the political cause is a dispute as to the actual ownership of the Khurma district. King Hussein has put forward a very good case in proof of his owner ship of Khurma, and this, after much delay, has received the support of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, but Ibn Saud, who bases his claims more upon the allegiance of the population of the Khurma district than on ownership of the actual ground, has agreed that the quarrel should be submitted to our arbitration. The territorial dispute has its origin in the conversion to Wahabism in 1914, of the King’s local representative at Khurma, a Sherif named Khalid!4T * *5* 2 whom die King appointed Emir of Khurma before the war. By embracing \» abavism Khalid became a rebel and for four years the King appears to have taken no step to rectify the position at Khurma or to collect his taxes there. .In 1918, however, he sent tax gatherers, but they were arrested by Khalid, who, realising that his action meant war, collected a scrap Bedouin iorce, with which he ejected all loyal elements from Khurma. In May 1918, the^ King drew our attention to Ibn Saud’s “ oppression and encroachment on tribes bound firmly to the Emirs of Mecca from ancient tunes, and said that, in consequence, he had been compelled to send a force to Khurma. This force consisted of about 800 Bedou under Sherif Hamud, a brother of Emir Shakir, and though it was claimed to have restored 1 1 .;’r soon after its arrival at Khurma, the King sent reinforcements in June comprising 82 men, 2 old guns and 2 machine guns. This force was surprised by a party of Ikhwan, losing 14 killed and all its guns. , Mttttary Incidents.—^o\\ovrmg this defeat Emir Shakir was despatched 3 t ic King to the Kuima District with about 800 men and 4 guns and 6 machine guns. The King stated that he was to occupy-Khurma as Emir oi the Ateibah tribe (Khurma is Ateibah terrritory). Shakir’s force ultimatelv arrived at Marran. J rotary incident was an attack by a loyal Ateibah sub-tribe the Miqatah) under their Sheikh Shuleiwih, against the Ikhwan in Khurma but they were utterly routed. This attack was probably, though not necessarily, instigated by Shakir. Tn August Shakir moved from Marran and met the Ikhwans at Hannu veils, lb miles East of Khurma where his force was annihilated. It was reported that during the conflict one of the Ateibah tribal sections (the Ruqa) deserted en masse to the Ikhwan. Each side was blamed by the other as the aggressor in this action, but it was undoubtedly the result of Shakir’s advance from Marran, which may not, however/have been intended aggressively by him. Hp to this time, Ibn Saud, pronouncing the King the aggressor in every incident, declined to be responsible for his men at Khurml, though he affirmed that he himself would not intervene. In spite, however of Ibn Sands repeated denial of lending support to Khalid and the Ikhwan he cannot be absolved. Khalid undoubtedly was acting as his ao*ent and looked to him for guidance and help. In fact a letter written by Khalid to Ibn Saud after the Hannu wells fight, and which was seen by Mr. Pbilbv contained a full report of the action and stated that the captured o- uns we p’ being kept pending the orders of Ibn Saud as to disposal. ci ^ e ^ eat necessitated the despatch of further reinforcements to Emir ./iii ,, accordingly more guns and machine guns were sent from Abdullah s camp, but except for minor raids by the Ikhwan on caravans taking supplies Irom Taif to Shakir’s base, there were no military incidents for some time. &gt; The King and Abdullah continually repeated their promises to keep to defensive measures only and denied all aggressive intentions In one of the raids Abdullah's son had a narrow escape and the Ikhwan captured all his belongings. This- incensed Abdullah and he is known bv tae writer to have made up his mind at that time to obtain his revenue as soon as an opportunity occurred: he was itching to move Khurmawards m person. v,a,AU:&gt; But although the King and Abdullah had been warned consistently bv us to avoid aggressive acts or even an advance on Khurma, it must be emphasised ohet jhis policy of ours was dictated purely by military expediency and was deemed upon in spite of our strong sympathy with the King’s claim to Khurma. It was realized that the Sherifians could spare neither comman- ners troops, nor guns from the forces which were besieging Medina and further tnat a big defeat at Khurma at that time would probably resMt Tn a disastrous re-action on the siege operations by heartening Eakhri Pasha am 7 enabling him to come to some arrangement with Ibn Saud for the further defence of the city or for surrendering it to thelkhwah.3 Little was done, however, by India to call off Ibn Saud or to order him to cease his anti-Sherifian propaganda amongst Hejaz tribes. The Indian view at that time was that it would be wrong for us to support the King in military action against our Treaty ally, Ibn Saud, and it was not until March 1919 that a message was sent by His Majesty’s Government to Ibn Saud advising him to modify his attitude and to persuade his followers from further opposition to the administrative measures of King Hussein at Khurma.” Ihe fad of Medina in January 1919 left Abdullah free to set out on his long-cherished expedition to Kliurma, which, ho had often prophesied, 'would be^ over with the complete destruction of Ibn Saud’s forces within two days of his (Abdullah’s) arrival on the scene. It was feared by British advisers on both sides (Iraq and Egypt) that Abdullah s id-auvised move must inevitably result in a collision of the rival forces and it is quite probable that had Abdullah remained in Medina the present crisis would not have arisen. Indeed, bad we-been aware of the Emir’s actual warlike intentions we should no doubt have strongly protested against the advance instead of merely suggesting the impropriety of it. Abdullah’s regular force consisted of GO officers, 770 other ranks, ten guns and twenty machine guns. It reached Asheira early in April ? As soon as he heard of Abdullah’s move from Medina, Ibn Saud began counter-preparations. Ho certainly warned His Britannic Majesty’s Government of these, and, reasserting his wish for arbitration, stated that he was compelled by pressure of public opinion to take measures against aggression by the Sherifian troops. “ If the King and Abdullah will remain in their otvn places,” he said, “ I will remain in mine.” But although we looked upon Abdullah’s advance as unwise and foolhardy and advised him not to start, we do not, and cannot, deny his right to occupy Khurma. The next military incident was a raid by Ikhwan (as reported bv Abdullah) on loyalists at Degheibjak early in May 1919. The raiders were pursued by a detachment of Abdullah’s who failed to overtake them but intercepted and defeated a second party, said to be en route to attack a Sherifian post at Madarmah. About the same date another detachment of Ikhwan was attacked at Badheim by a patrol of Abdullah’s and routed, whilst sleeping, by a hand grenade bombardment. Of these raids we have not yet received reports from Ibn Saud’s side. On May 21st Abdullah reported that, after two and a half hours’ fighting he occupied Tarabah, and that, after consolidating it, he would advance to Khurma. In that report Abdullah stands self-condemned. He had obviously scrapped his defensive policy and doubtless decided to take the Ikhwan raid on Degheibjah as his excuse for an attack on Tarabah. Abdullah also reported the arrival in person of Ibn Saud at Sakkhah (80 miles N. E. of Khurma). We may be sure that if Ibn Saud does not deny that the Ikhwan raid on Degheibjah ever took place, he certainly will assert that it was not done at his instigation and was, therefore, an ordinary tribal raid for which he cannot be held responsible. On the night of the 25-26th May, the Ikhwan under Emir Khalid attacked Abdullah at Tarabah, driving him out, and, according to several accounts, destroyed his regular^ force, capturing all its guns and machine guns. Emir Abdullah got away with 500 irregular mounted men only, and retired to Okheidir. Later information shows that Sherif Sbaraf (Abdullah’s second-in command) had a small force at Kelaikh, which the Ikhwan attacked at dawn on May 26th, but were repulsed. Sbaraf afterwards decided to join Abdullah at Okheidir. The retirement on this latter place was probably necessary to protect the Sherifial base at Asheirah. \ With the destruction of Abdullah's army, the road from Khurma to Taif lies open to the enemy. Mecca and even Jeddah are at the mercy of the fanatical Ikhwan. From Medina, Emir Ali can only send reinforcements of the same fighting value as Abdullah’s original force.Results.—It is a sad fact that in every conflict with the I kb wan the Sheridan forces have been badly defeated. Abdullah’s regular army has filled the expecta tions of the British Officers who served with it during the war. After two and a half years’ experience of war service it has failed when put to its first crucial test, and although heavily equipped with guns and machine guns it apparently failed to put up any sort of a fight against an untrained enemy armed only with rifles. Future policy .—Although King Hussein may now receive temporary military assistance from us, the question arrises—what steps does he propose to take for the permanent defence of Mecca and Medina ? The rightful guardians of these places are, of course, the great Harb Tribal Confederation, in wffiose territory they lie, but whether they would obey a call to arms is problematical because their allegiance to the King has become impaired by the considerable arrears of pay in which Emirs Abdullah and Ali kept them during and since the w ar. And, further, they are just as vulnerable to the proselytising methods of the Ikhwan as the other tribes, and at a critical moment might go over en masse to the oppssite side. * The Ikhwan menace will not cease when the present crisis is over. Aeroplane defence of Taif and Mecca can be but temporary, even if its moral effects (combined w ith our political pressure on Ibfl Saud) are great enouo'h to stall Ikhwan aggression, hut directly our aeroplanes are withdrawn the pro- Nejd tribes on the frontier wrill recommence their raids and the safety of the Holy Places will depend on—• (1) The maintenance of a regular force by the King. This, to be of any use, must be trained and staffed by qualified officers and must be of a very different type to the present Arab Army. (2) Our hold on Ibn Saud from the East. (3) The King’s alliance with Ibn Bashid. The King should be able to maintain an army good enough to stop Ikhwan and other raids not organized or supported by Ibn Saud. Unfortunately, there seems to be little hope that the King’s forces wall ever be able to cope wath Ibn Saud’s armies, and the task of keeping the latter in check will, therefore devolve on His Britannic Majesty’s Government. And with regard to the means at our disposal of subjugating Ibn Saud, it is suggested that threats by our forces on his eastern districts, Hasa, Hofuf, etc., from whence he draws his supplies and which are greatly prized at Biadh, are much more likely to be effective than giving King Hussein military assistance which, as has been proved, is only an indirect method of ordnance supplv for It should not be forgotten that the King’s dream of an Arab Empire over which he or his successors will reign, is also Ibn Saud’s dream, with himself in the leading role. But, whereas the King is dependent for his army upon mercenaries of the worst type, Ibn Saud has at his command large forces prompted by religious fanaticism of a most desperate and self-sacrificino* character. 3 The third factor likely to be of use in keeping Ibn Saud in check would .;e by our fostering the promised alliance between King Hussein and Ibn Bashid. The latter has always been a doughty opponent of Wahabism and can coUect large Bedouin forces from Central Arabia for threatening the Neid lines of communication. But this will no doubt mean paying a subsidy to Ibn Rashid, probably through the King. It is indeed difficult to see how Ibn Bashid can be brought into line without the inevitable subsidy drawn by all the other leading chiefs of Arabia. He himself appears willing to be the first Arabian Chief to accept Hussein’s suzerainty (at a price). For the further repression of the Wahabi and Ikhwan movements it will be necessary to include in the Treaties ultimately to be made with the individual independent Arab rulers, except Ibn Saud, a clause under which the latter is made responsible that Ikhwan missionaries are not sent out of his territory, and further, giving power to the other rulers to expel such Ikhwan missionaries asmay obtain entry into their countries. Such a clause would give the utmost satisfaction to all the orthodox Moslem rulers. Ibn Saud has now been ordered to withdraw all his forces from Khurma, failing which his intentions will be regarded as hostile to His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and his treaty rights and subsidy will be forthwith cancelled. ^ • The geography of the Khurma district is practically unknown to us— even the distance of Taif from Mecca is not agreed upon by those who have visited both places. Mr. Philby passed through Khurma on a journey from Biadh to Jeddah in 1917, but he has not yet issued any detailed maps. The positions of the villages East of Taif shown on the attached sketch map are, therefore, only approximate. Arab Bureau; N. GARLAND, Captain.“ Note on thi Khurma Dispute.” Appendix. Latest Information. Later reports from Jeddah have contirmed the completeness of Abdullah’s defeat at Tarabah. According to a telegram sent by the King to Emir Feisal, the “ martyrs ’’ (i.e Sherifian killed) amounted to 250, including several Ateibah Sheikhs and also Seyyid Hilmi who was Abdullah’s Major General Commanding the so-called “ Division ” of • Regular troops. Emirs Abdullah and Shakir were themselves slightly wounded ; all guns and machine guns and two-thirds of the supplies were lost; and only one-tenth of the Mule Mounted infantry got away. It is worthy of note that, although they had had previous warningof the night attack, the regular officers who got away did so in their night attire. It w as ever one of the Baghdadi Officer’s maxims not to allow military duties to interfere with his night’s rest, and during the war, outposts, picquets, and the like w'ere invariably dispensed with by the Hejaz armies. The 10,000 Bedouin originally reported to be with Abdullah seem to have melted away and, as Colonel Bassett remarks, u everything points to the majority of the tribal elements which profess allegiance to King Hussein being absolutely unreliable.” A consoling feature is that the captors of the guns, etc., have no followers trained in their manipulation and employment. In spite of the King’s assertion that Ibn Saud reinforced Tarabah and Khurma, with a view to attacking Abdullah, no enemy advance from Tarabah is reported. Abdullah, according to the King, is now (&lt; remaining on the defensive,” but both he and the King fear an advance by Ibn Saud on Taif and Mecca. It is thought, however, that Ibn Saud will now rest content with his success and his reoccupation of Tarabah. He has common-sense enough to realize that any further advance towards the IIejaz Cities would mean sacrificing our friendship, subsidy and help, and he must realize that we possess the means to punish him even if he knows the King does not. It seems probable that His Britannic Majesty’s Government’s orders to withdraw from Tarabah will have the desired effect when he gets them. The fact that the Ikhwan have not advanced from Tarabah since they recaptured it, tends to show that Ibn Saud has them under some sort of control and if the more fanatical elements had intended to raid Taif without his authority they would surely have moved towards it by this time. On the arrival of our aeroplanes, the King will no doubt insist on immediate punitive bombing raids on Tarabah, Khurraa and other Ikhwan camps, but it appears necessary that the possible results of such action should be well considered befipre undertaking it. From every point of view it will be infinitely better if Ibn Saud can be compelled to withdraw by political pressure from Baghdad, as aeroplane bombing would increase the hatred and ill-will between Nejd and Mecca, would render future reconciliation more difficult, would henceforth affect the hospitality extended to British official travellers through Nejd, and might quite conceivably precipitate a wholesale conflagration, besides possibly forming matter (suitably distorted) for Indian anti-Sherifian propaganda. One feels constrained, therefore, to suggest that the aeroplanes should be reserved entirely for defence purposes, in case of an advance by Ikhwan from their present posL tions. And, if Ibn Saud retires personally from Khurma district, it would be wisest for the King to refrain from occupying it until the boundary dispute is settled by our arbitration. The King will, of course, denounce this as a mere maintenance of the defensive policy, which, according to his views, is at the root of the present trouble, but he should realize by this time that armies incapable of carrying out successful offensives have no alternative to keeping to defensive measures. It is obvious that the settlement by us of the boundary between Nejd and the Hejaz is one of the Arabian affairs claiming our prompt attention and it ought not to be much lono-er delayed. The military position at Khurma today (10th June 1919) is as follows :— Ibn Saud is said to be at Tarabah and his force probably amounts to 20,000 Bedouin of which some are posted 10 miles W. of Tarabah. Emir Abdullah has collected from his original force a remnant of about 3,000 Bedouin at Okheidir. 250 semi-trained regulars have left Mecca under Sagh. Kaisuni to join the Emir, whilst Emir Ali at Medina is reported to be sending some machine guns and ammunition. CilBO, TJated 10th June 1019- } N. GARLAND,-ST 9 •&lt;v; Telegram P.

The King wrote Faying that Taifian Arabe were being robbed and •♦Zikat' being collected from them by Ibn Baud; on looking uo/ to the Arabic letter T found it was nicely worded, it might have been the \rabe of Taif or rabs originally of Taif.

After conpjiraente and enquiries after health etc* I'egardihf the i’liarif \fo have been constantly writing to Inforn you of hie affairs, but you dohot listen 1 to up* 'henever you tell us anything we accept it ae true and conform to your wishes in spite of our own know ledge that you are wron&gt;z;. By Almighty God 0 Abdul Aziz had you listened to us from the very beginning,then,God willing, the Lk&amp;rif vrould not have been in existence now. ’^or the present, the news about the occurence (raid) has been transmitted to you by Fhalid* I wanted to come to see you when I received news of the occurrence at Khurma but Khalid persuaded me to return to Tarabah, As regards our not retaliating by God we are doing our utmost. We are not rulers like you to draw the sword on men at will but are only Beduin Shaikhs and we only try to safeguard ourselves and also point out to them that you are to be feared. This man (Sharif) is hated by all men by his doings, both earthly and spiritual(religious). These neither please God from beginning to end. You are aware 0 Abdul Aziz the number of the cagoom who have died in his custody, tney come upto ICO men; but by God we have not so far obeyed the Sharif nor are we going to obey him in the future. Of course he cennot se'j^e or capture a single individual out of tne ^agoom, except only when he be a pilgrim. These are his evil deeds : It is only those who go out ae pilgrims to God’s Bouse (Mecca) feeling safe that fall victims to him and his minions. Now if the Bharif wants peace or root and if the friends who are on hia side ( meaning the -.ritisft) can control him, then they should atop him from ( coming or sending, representa tives) Taif and should keep him in Mecca and in this way he will cease to create trouble or aggressive acts. 'eon onr part would undertake to control our ra«n. But if the Sharif aits at Taif and continues to send out raiding parties against our tribesmen then by God we will not desist from doing *rhat will please you. In such an even- tualityif any excesses are uomnitted you must excuse us. You should as soon as this letter reaches you send out a sensible man to address ( lit: warn) the people to be quiet till we see ( what transpires) and we shall support him. We have given you the sincere advice which is in cumbent upon us$ may God help us even as we deal with you and the Huslims. I have writteh briefly as Khalid wrote to you ( at length) in my presence as we both concur. Lh.liAL ENDING. •I/l^. / HtS+b.i.qjk Telegram From - Political, Baghdad To - Political, Bahrain.

USUAL COMMENCEMENT (l) I am writing to give you the newc about myself your friend and regarding other matters in the world. I have to apologize for having not written for so long, but have been taken up with the festivitees connected with _X-mas and the New Year. As Your Excellency knows on these occa sions much has to be done in the way of entertainment and receiving the leaders of the people. During X-mas week I proceeded to the centre of the island and spent four days (ganas). I took with me as ray guests Abdul Aziz .,,usaibi and Mr. Yusuf Kanoo,whom you know, also my friend Farhan al Bahama ^rom the Shaikhs of the Muntafik, and also leaders of the people of Bahrain. Thanks be to God I am well and hope Your Excellency is the same. ( P ,) Regarding Your Excellency f s affairs. I have had no answer from Baghdad to your last letter in which you forwarded letters from the Amirs of Taraba and Khurraa. (3) Regarding your request for some gold to be sent to you each month. I have to say that His Majesty*^ Government has sent me a consignment of Liras. I hope c therefore to be able to send you each month a percentage of your subsidy in this metal. I am awaiting orders from Civil Commissioner as to how much this will be. I am glad to have been able to arrange this for your Excellency. M) Regarding the news of tne world. In the direction of Mosul as I have already informed v ou Mr. Bill late D.P.R. Bushire and his assistant Capt* Ccott were murdered at AQ,RA near Mosul on the Pnd November. Since that date a strong British Force has been operating against the murderers and their tribes the Kurds, full vengeance has now been exacted, many villages of the evildooers have been -THS ARREST OF BRITISH OFFICERS. ARAB OFFICIALS TO BE PUNISHED. To© official news states tbat the Amir Faisal telegraphing from Paris on tne IS^h December, ,his repndiateri the action of Ramadhan Shalash, and has ordered the Arab authorities in Damascus to order Arab officials at Dair ez-Zar to with draw and to release the British otficia s. The Amir Faisal has further intimated that those responsible for the recent outrages at Dair- ez-Zar will be punished as rebels. The following is the full text of the message whioh the Amir Faisal has sent fjmm Paris to the Amir Zaid at Damascus : /*K“It has been reported that a party under Ramadhan Shalash and Ajaimi Al Sadun have attacked Dair-ez Zir, pretending that ti^sy a e acting under instructions from the Arab Govern ment. It is hereby declared that this out rage which • is directed egainst our Ally, Great Britiin, and a^insc the welfare of the Ara i nation, and which is contrary to the provisional arrangement entered into last year with the Allied Powers, was committed without the knowledge or author ity of the Arab Government. “Tdose responsible and any persons who may subsequently join them, are hereby declared rebels, and will be punished as such. The necessary steps are being taken to restore order, and to arrest offend ers. You will also order any Arab officials who may, now be at Dair-ez Zar to withdraw, and you will direct that the British officers detained there shall be released and handed over to the nearest British authorities. I shall take further necessary action on my arrival, but if the British wish you to take any immediate steps you should comply.” It is understood that the Amir Zaid has j published these orders, and is taking all other action called for in the circumstances. Basra, 21st December Later.destroyed and heavy fines have been paid up and the troops have all now returned to Mosul and Baghdad. There appears no doubt that the Turks were at the bottom of the murder of the officers mentioned. (5) In the direction of the Caucassus - the British forces have again occupied Batum and Baku. This to prevent the Bolsheviks coming and seizing these places. (?) In the direction of Sham, a raiding party of Arabs and ex-Turk Zabtiyahs early in December under the com mand of one Ramadhan Shalash and accompanied by that dis satisfied wandererAjami al Saadum, made a sudden raid in Dair El Zor, a British port on the road between Baghdad and Allepo. The raiders seized the town and imprisoned the British Arab officials there, including two British officers They did much damage by burning the bazaar. The raiders stated they were acting tinder the orders of the Amir Faisal The latter hearing the state of Affairs sent the following order from Paris to his hakil in Damascus the Amir Zaid. There can be no doubt that the movement was started either by the Turks or by some evil men of the Amir Faisal’s party who hate the English. The above matter has now been settled ^&gt;d and the officials and British officers hafaded over safely to the °ritish authorities,but I send you the information ^ as it may interest you f ( r ') From the Hejaz news has reached me that on the 7th January General Allenby the conqueror of Sham visited Jeddah on a visit to the Sharif Husain. He was received with great honour o ^ ro r +.J.■?an:i f e city was decorated in his honour. The Sharif met v eneral Allenby on the Pier and after a grand dinner party presented him with a gold sword of honour, also pinned on his breast the Order of 'The Grand Cordon of the :':ahdi ?f . ( 8 ) I am looking forward with.delight to the day when I shall meet Your Excellency in Kasa. 1 trv.?'* you : 1 1 1 (.t me know early when you will hr coming there in order that I may make full arrangements beforehand. (9) I am glad to inform Your Excellency that we were able to arrange the 15000 bags of rice which Your Excellency desired m: fo do. Phis has offended me much pleasure. Further rice from India has commenced coming, so I hope the scarcity in this community is now at end in Bahrain, Qat&amp;f and Hassa. The improvement will not be felt atonce, but will be seen in about one months time I hope. (OQ) I am very glad to give Your Excellency the happy news just received that Your Excellency's son Faisal and'his party safely arrived in Bombay and are in good health. Hoping You are in gxxdxkxaitk keeping in the very best of health and happiness. USUAL ENDING. Lajor, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrain.Telegram From - Political, Bahrain* To - political, Ba^Mai.

USUAL EliDIUG. ^hljUTranslation of a letter dated the 14th Kabi al Awwa 13«56(tfth January, 195&gt;0) from Bin £aud, to the Political Agent, Bahrain, £ After Compliments ns iou have informed /that you forwarded my letteri telegraphically/ to the Acting Civil Commissioner,Baghdad, and that you have received a reply to the effect that he thinks that the reports were incorrect and.that the Britisl representative (at Jeddah) ia convinced that All and hie brother have made no hoetile movement and that there- was nothing to confirm the reports (which I sent) regarding Al: * aggressive acts. Yes, I donot disbelieve the British repre sentative,knowj ng that he is entirely loyal to his Govern ment and is honest and doing his beet. But in making my report I feel like unto the man who spoke the proverb 'Ask^ ene who has experienced and donot ask the doctor”, for I constantly informed the riigh Government of the hostile act£ and movements of the Sharif and they kept on giving me regular replies, on the authority of their representatives at Jeddah and Lgypt that there had been no movements at all till at last came the four definite acts on the part of the t harif• After that I informed His ajesty’s Government of the move of the Sharif’s son from Madinah and they denied this again on the authority of the reports of their repre sentatives at Jeddah and Egypt until at last came the Sharif’s treacherous attack on TUHABAH. I know and believe that representatives of the ^reat Government are entirely truthful, but the- are igno rant of three things : firstly, the false nature of the Sharif; secondly, the concealment of hi© evil plans from them; thirdly, they have no men who could give correct in formation of affairs in the iiejaz, this being due to the Sharif’s care in not allowing them free intercourse with the people of ^ejaz, his keeping them under his care ful surveillance. I again inform your honour that this mycommunication id not made out of fear of the S rif: God willing, nothing can happen with out Mis will, but my object in informing you is that I may not be held reeponeible should anything of a reportable nature happen. I desire only tnat my excuse will be clear to the High Government. The events which have already happened have been commu nicated to your honour by me and they are corraborated by two letters,which you will find enclosed herewith, to Khalid and Ibn Ghannam-* In the beginning cf the letter Ali tries to persuade them and in the end threatens them, and also by his intimation in his letter to Ibn Ghannam, namely that his forces are fully prepared and that he is determined not to give up this part of the country.
