S'/3 Dear Sir, On 29 / 9 / /, 95 ^ we supplied THR^E STIFLES of MBSOWHITE COTTONSEED required on your account by Sa'id Abdul Nur, who informed us that he was an Iraqi who had been engaged for your Agricultural Department. The three strains supplied were as follows:- R 68 15 lbs . R 82 15 H R 90 15 It advise you that kessrs.Abdul Aziz al Hasan al qi - cl Qisaibi and Go. of Bahrein have been supplied with 60 lbs. of each of the above strains in response to a telegram that they sent to their Baghdad agent. Y/e should be grateful for information as to the facilities that exist in Bahrein for cotton growing, and to what use it is proposed to put this Mesowhite cotton should it prove suitable. Yie should also like to know how it is proposed to gin the cotton. SSM 7 Yours f^l^thfu^ly-,- '.'AdbuJ^. ^Manager / - //s © No. mi Political Agency, Bahrain, the 7ih Llay 1931 To The manager, British Cotton Crowing Association, B A G ii L A Dear Sir, Please refer to your letter No.877 dated the £th April 1931. I regret I have not been able to reply to it earlier but 1 have been away from Bahrain. You asked me what facilities exist in Bahrain for the growing of cotton. In Bahrain we have a good water supply for a considerable area of the Islana and a soil that is in many parts suitable for the best ualities of cotton. There is little doubt that a hundred or more years ago Bahrain was a cotton ^rowin'’ of considerable importance and its cotton was exported as far afield as Baghdad. Principally owing to tlie opprt ,sion of the cultivators by the Ruling family large areas of land went out of cultivation and in recent years little, except dates, has been cultivated. Bahrain now has a stable Government ana the Agricultural Expert whom you mention has been engaged to organize an Agricultural Department. Some five acres of land have been planted and so far tne result appears to have been very successful and LIr.

We are very much obliged for the information that you have kindly supplied, and we much appreciate your kind invitation to cooperate with you in the development of cotton growing in Bahrein. We find that it is very necessary to guard against undue optimism in the beginning. Even in what are considered to be the most promising areas it seldom happens that cotton growing makes rapid progress in the beginning. The fact that after 12 years of constant endeavour and heavy expenditure the crop in »Iraq for 1930 amounted to only 3300 bales is an indication of the The present value of a bale is about £l0« We note that this year 5 acres have been planted end that next year it is hoped that 2o acres will be planted. We also note that a considerable area of Bahrein has a good water supply. We should be grateful for information as to whether this supply is available in the height of summer because it is then that the water is badly required by the cotton. difficulties that have to be faced.No.1590 - 2 - 16/5/1931. It would be very helpful if you could explain to us how the five acres are irrigated and how it is proposed to irrigate the 20 acres, and also give us some guidance as to the actual area available for cotton cultivation if the results on a small scale should prove satisfactory. We must point out that at present the market for cotton is in a very depressed state but of course we hope that by next year matters will have improved. It is perhaps as well that no gins exist in Bahrein because in any case it is desirable that cotton before export should be baled with a hydraulic press. On this account we have received consignments of cotton for ginning and pressing from Persia. We therefore recommend that no steps be taken to instal a gin for the present, but that the unginned cotton be shipped to Basrah where we would take delivery. In this connection we should be glad of particulars as to the shipping facilities from Bahrein to Basrah, end the rate of freight• Should future prospects indicate the desirability of installing a gin we would probably be able to assist in this matter but under ordinary circumstances the cost of gins is met by the Agricultural Departments requiring them. It appears that Mr. Abdul Nur is referring to a small experimental gin that we gave to the Cotton Expert for carrying out tests, but which is quite unsuitable for ginning several acres of cotton* As regards the three strains of seed under reference in our No.877 of 6/4/1931 we consider that it would have been far better to have been satisfied with one strain, say R 82. We sent to Messrs. Qusaibi &amp; Co. the three strains under reference in our No.877 of 6/4/1931 because we did not wish to appear obstructive but had the applicant been resident in Iraq we would have asked him who had put the idea into his head and then arranged to supply him with what w e considered desirable./ HO.1590. - 3 - 16/5/1931. V. ^ We sometimes get esses like this in Irsq when junior employees of the Oepsrtment of Agriculture hsve been endeavouring to impress their friends by references to investigstions upon which they themselves ere imperfectly informed. It frequently happens that all sorts of difficulties arise through the attempts of private individuals to carry out tests, because they seldom keep accurate records and their efforts result in all sorts of undesirable crossing taking place.

Will you please let us know whether there is any local outlet for ginned cotton. Possibly in the past cotton has been imported from Persia or India for stuffing cushions and mattresses and also for spinning into yarn.

Vile thought that it was probable that in the past the people had imported cotton not only for stuffing mattresses but also for spinning into yearn.

Such a show would therefore be confined practically to the Government and Europeans, but I will discuss the matter with the Agriculturist and see what can be done. The local people consider that the growing of flowers and trees which do not produce edible results is a waste of time and energy, even H. E. Shaikh Hamad holds this view. Also they do not care for most &lt;pf the European vegetables such as carrots, narsnirs etc. which all grow verv well here if properly looked after.

In theiij/own country practically every coffee-shop with a few yards to spare makes a point of adorning it with a flov/er-bed or two. I think a taste for vegetables is on the increase but here again people would be slow to change their habits unless they see what can be produced and its advantages as an article of diet. Trie show which I had in mind could be on a very modest scale and more with the object of interesting people in the produce of the soil than dispensing expensive prizes.

Although the proposals outlined have been dram up to meet military commitments in Persia based on local conditions it is the intention to apply some Similar method to Iraq and those areas where troops may be located. 2. A certain measure of success has been in Iraq by encouraging local cultivators but ud to now this has not been on any large scale. 3. I should be glad of^comraents you may wish to make concerning these proposals together with the names of reliable individuals who would be prepared to accept seed and be prepared to produce vegetables as required. The quantities and varieties of seed available for Iraq will be the same as those arranged for Persia* Seed is expected to arrive in the very near future.

ST/1179/24P/4 ^ HQpS TENTH AHKY, S&amp;T Directorate, Dated 26th July 42. In Iraq the growing of summer vegetables has increased considerably as a result of attractive prices, radio propaganda and direct contact with ta big landowners. In addition, details of likely requirements in all areas were notified to the Director General of Agriculture who arranged the distribution of indigenous seed in sufficient quantities to meet our anticipated demands. Our demands have not in fact reached the expected quantities, with the result that summer vegetables in most areas are plentiful and prices have eased. No financial assistance was given to growers, nor was any free issue of seed made. While the progress made in Iraq with the summer varieties may be considered satisfactory, the growing of winter vegetables did not increase last year to any noticeable extent and there was a severe shortage. The reasons were that most of the small growers were unwilling to plant as they were not familiar with the varieties required and sufficient good quality seed was not available. To ensure sufficient seed for the coming winter, the Iraq Govt was aksed how much they required to augment their own stocks. Double the quantity they indicated was ordered from India and M.E. These seeds should arrive very shortly and be sufficient &amp; for both Persia &amp; Iraq. The outstanding difficulties therefore are to discover the best method of distributing the seed and to ensure that the small growers are persuaded to plant varieties, which in most parts of Iraq and 3. Persia have hitherto not been grown to any large extent except by the more educated growers. Tlie P.4* has ruled that no financial assistance be given to growers and seed may not therefore be distributed free. The alternatives are to sell to the Persian and Iraqi ttanraraMiaMfe Agricultural Dept, and private growers for cash or to distribute to growers on a 'return in kind' basis. In the first case it is unlikely that anyone will pay the high prices of imported seed; in the second case, distribution to many growers would result in Supply Depots having to receive vegetables from more than one supplier &amp;t the same oime. Control would be impossible. It is believed, therefore, that the only satisfactory method will be distributing to a few important growers on a 'return in kind' basis. These growers can continue the distribution to the small cultivators if they wish. Please consult Lieut. Colonel Galloway on receipt of this letter with a view to immediate action on the following lines or or a) Sale of seed to Persian Ministry of Agriculture, b, Sale of seed to important labdowners. ’c) Contracts with important landowners on a 'return in kind' basis.

Fresh European vegetables of setae kind are obtainable from December till May! the sowing time is from the end of September until the end of December. The following species do well in Bahrain during the winter:- Beet Celery Spinach Cabbage lettuce Turnip Cauliflower Onion Carrot Parsley The following have been grown as winter crops with varying degrees of success Artichoke Garlic Leek Sugar beet Asparagus (small quantity doing very well) Beans (a local type is grown successfully in the summer but imported varieties produce poor results) Peas Potatoes Swede The following summer vegetables are grown Cucumber Sweet potatoes %g plant Marrows pumpkins Miloas Okra Spinach Cape Gooseberries Indian Corn Local summer Vegetables such as egg plant, ladies fingers etc., are grown in most of the gardens belonging to the local Aftabs as they eat these vegetables themselves but European varieties are grown only by a few cultivators, principally in the Government Experimental Garaen at Budeya and^naj Mansoor al Arayedh, Hussain Yatjean, G 9 M| Khan, Mohamad Taher and Khalil Kanoo. It is extremely difficult to estimate the quantity grown every season but the amount has certainly increased very greatly during recent years. It would be difficult and- 2 - I tiiinic almost impossible to obtain tba gu/irantee of a regular supply from these growers over a given period. One of the difficulties which has been encountered is the fact that certain vegetables, not root crops, especially cabbages and cauliflowers, ripen at the same time who the r planted durin# the same month or over a period. For several weeks there may be quantities of cabnages in the market, so many that the price becomes loss than tho cost of cultivation. This has discouraged may cultivators from growing except in small quantities. Attempts to retard ripening or to extend thr season have failed. The Bahrain Government has an Agricultural Expert from the Egyptian Department of Agriculture who supervises the Government Garden and also advises tae landowners, there is also an Agricultural Committee under the Presidency of Shaikh Ibrahim bin Shaikh Mohamad which deals with matters affecting agriculture. This committee has proposed that the Govern®; nt should supply seeds, at cost price, through the committee to the small garden owners and the proposal has been accepted but the type of seeds envisaged was grain not vegetables. If seeds are available the Bahrain Government will be glad to purchase some and to distribute thorn to suitable cultivators but at this stage it is not practicable to demand an assurance from the cultivators that they will produce vegetables, in almost every case if this condition was made the cultivators would refuse to enter into an ar rang erne nt. Bahrain is very different to Iraq. Here the local population t until a year or two ago, had never seen European vegetables and even now only a very few of the local Arabs eat any vegetables except the poor quaj^At/ local ones \- A • 3 - which they have always grown* IiJuropean vegetables are bought almost entirely by foreigners, iSuropeans, Indians and Syrians etc. I suggest that the Bahrain Government should be enabled to purchase seeds of the following varieties Carrots Cabbages W Cauliflower Spinach Beans are rather a doubtful crop in Bahrain. The Bahrain Government is prepared to do all that is possible to encourage garden owners to cultivate vegetables I in larger quantities than before by Wireless and newspaper propaganda and through tho Agricultural Committee. I esti- laate that up to 50 acres of garden space might be used for vegetable cultivation in Bahrain this year. I would suggest growing the 4 kinds of vegetables of which there is a good probability of success in equal proportions, 12 ^ acres of each kind. For this we should require the following quantity of seeds:- Cabbage 10 lbs Cauliflower 10 w Carrot 15 ' Spinach 25 * This estimate is slightly generous but it is probable that production could be increased by distributing seedlings to cultivators who are unable to grow the vegetable s from seed. If the Bali red n Government may be allowed to purchase this quantity of seeds I will endeavour to ensure that a continuous supply of vegetables is available in the market for the troops who are stationed here* If necessary the Agricultural Committee could arrange to purchase supplies of vegetables for supplying to the forces.No ♦1669-6/26 Political Agency,Bahrain 16th September,1942• To C.H.IJUS.C.

Memorandum f ? ‘ f « t The Government of India have asked me to let them know whether the seed wheat sent to Bahrain last year was received in time, whether we were able to utilise it and, if so, with what results. 2. Will you please let me have a report on these points for the information of the Government of India ? Political Agent, Bahrain'/heat Cultivation in Bahrain. In the Autumn of 1942 wheat was grown in various parts of Bahrain on a larger scale than has been pre viously attempted. In the past wheat has been grown as a rain crop on the plain below Rafaa and in one or two other localities. There is no record of wheat having been grown in Bahrain on irrigated land. 2. The Bahrain Government purchased a supply of wheat seed from India but the seed was so late in arriving that only a few bags were used and these were supplied to garden owners who each bought sfed^ll quantities of seed. The results of the Indian seed cannot be judged because it was sown late in the season and nowhere on large scale. In one garden in I.oharraq it grew success fully and the owner, Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohamed, reported that the crop produced eighteen times the quantity that had been sown, in an area of two acres. This garden however was well manured and carefully looked after and there was no loss from birds. A sample of wheat from this garden ife forwarded with this report, the wheat was sifted and graded and the quantity of each grade represents the proportion of large, medium and small seeds in the whole crop. 3. In another garden two bags of seed were sown which produced ten bags of corn. All the Indian wheat seed, and also the Canadian seed, which was planted as a rain crop was a complete failure owing to lack of rain at the time when it was needed. 4. The average rainfall in Bahrain is about 2* inches annually and it occurs over a period of several months.2 Some tines most of the rain falls in two or three w^eks in other years it is spread over as many months. For this reason any crop depending upon rainfall is uncertain. The wheat which is sown most years on the Rafaa plain, in an area of about 10 - 15 acres, usually produces good results once in every three years. 5. Before the Indian wheat seed arrived in Bahrain the Government had obtained a quantity of Manitoba wheat from Canada. A sample of this wheat was sent to the Agricultural Department of the Egyptian Government, by air, to be tested. It was reported that gemination was 90% successful and as the Indian seed had not arrived and the season for sowing wheat was on hand the Bahrain Governioent used the Canadian wheat for planting. 6 . Canadian wheat was sown by the Government in two areas, on new ground near the Palace garden on the edge of Panama town and in the Experimental garden at Budeya. His Highness Shaikh Salman and several of his relations planted large areas of land with wheat on the island of 0m al Naasan, south of Zellaq and on the coast beyond Jesra. In most of these areas wheat was sown on ground not previously cultivated,in some places the wheat depended on rain and some places it was irrigated. 7. The largest area sown by the Government, near the Palace, was a complete failure, The wheat germinated but when it was a few inches high the new irrigation channels carried the light sandy soil of which the garden consisted over the beds and smothered the young wheat. By this time it was too late to sow another crop. 8 . Cultivation at Budeya was more successful. A crop, which was regarded as good according to local3 Bahrain standards, was grown in three acres of the garden previously planted with lucerne. This garden was under constant supervision and boys were employed all day to keep the birds away. Two bags were sown and fourteen bags were gathered. A sample is enclosed. Wherever wheat was grown a great proiDortion was destroyed by sparrows. At the time when the corn was ripe there were no other fruits or grains for the sparrows to feed on and wherever wheat was grown large flocks of birds assembled. 9. /heat planted by His Highness Shaikh Salman at Om al Naasan and other areas on the coast was almost without exception unsuccessful. The same failure was reported from the gardens of Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa. Small patches of wheat which were grown in many little gardens, among vegetable beds, lucerne and date palms, were generally successful but the areas and quantities were insignificant. 10. Unfortunately before the wheat showed any definite promise the Egyptian Agriculturist, Hussain Hffendi, who supervised its cultivation, left Bahrain on leave and it is possible that some of the cultivators, especially in the gardens of the Shaikhs, lost interest in the experiment and failed to irrigate it properly. 11. The fact remains that in some gardens both Indian and Canadian wheat was grown with some success and it seems evident that wheat can be grown, on irrigated land, in Bah ain.I 4 12. It is doubtful whether it is profitable to grow wheat on irrigated land in Bahrain, Irrigation entails considerable labour and the land used for wheat could produce lucerne and various vegetables which are more valuable commercially than wheat. Wheat grown as a rain crop would be profitable but uncertainty of the season and quantity of the rainfall rules out this possibility. 13. This first experiment in growing wheat was net successful but it depended almost entirely on Canadian wheat owing to the late arrival of the Indian wheat seed. I would like to try again this year, using Indian seed and also the wheat that has been harvested in Bahrain, which may have become acclimatised to local conditions. I should be grateful if the Government of India could be requested to suxoply the Bahrain Government with 150 bags of wheat seed from the Government seed farms.Wheat Cultivation in Bahrain In the Autumn of 1942 wheat was grown in various parts of Bahrain on a larger scale than has been pre viously attempted.

Like Sir William Hooker over a hundred years ago, Sir Edward ^Salisbury gave up a botanical professorship to become Director of the Royal Gardens at Kew. | This change reflected a shift of interest from research and teaching to administration which has been common enough in the history of distinguished scientists, but few of them, at any rate in the botanical field, can have accumulated such a wealth of knowledge during their research period, nor applied it in administration so widely and effectively, as Sir Edward. The focus of Salisbury’s researches has been that point where physiology and ecology disciplines of systematic and geographical botany. 'This ‘synthetic’ approach has thrown much light, not only on the biology and distribution of British plants, which have been Sir Edward’s particular concern, but also on the many problems connected with the cultivation of plants on the farm and in the garden. A characteristic of his work has been his capacity to turn from detailed and often laborious researches (the number of indi vidual seeds he has counted while estimating the seed output of various species must run into hundreds of thousands) to the writing of admirably clear and Attractive expositions of botanical science for the itudent and for the general public: his Living Garden jias already become a classic. While still Quain Professor at University College. zvara Salisbury, Pnotverr.ph by Ronald Proctor. F.R P.P meet the older Salisbury’s wide knowledge and talent for administration led to a great demand for his services on committees and governing bodies, a demand which was increased by the coming of the war and bv the post-war biological problems following it. Since 1943 hi s position at Kew has still further exercised his administrative skill which, at the end of last vear. was recognized by his appointment as Biological Secretary of the Royal Society. Now there is hardly a botanical, agricultural or horti cultural activity in the country which does not call directly or indirectly on his wisdom and experience. The knighthood con ferred on him in the New Year’s Honours List was a fitting tribute to this outstandir g record of service to the plant sciences. But amidst this constant whirl of administrative activity nothing of Sir Edward’s almost uncanny know ledge of British plants has been lost. When he can snatch a day in the country, his power of naming week- old seedlings when they are still almost in\ isible remains undiminished, and, it called upon to honour his claim to be able to recognize most of the British Umbellifers by their smell, he would not be discomfited- I'he dislocation resulting from six vears of war pre sents unparalleled problems and opportunities in the botanical, agricultural and horticultural, as in other fields; and it is certain that no one will plav a greater part in the work of reconstruction than Sir Edward Salisbury, (msn) SOILLESS CULTIVATION the methods employed for nutritional studies as tar The idea of applying the well-known laboratory back as the work of Sachs, Knop and others, at the end methods of water-culture of plants to commercial crop of last century.

Tomatoes grouing in gravel under the sub-irrigation system of soilless cultivation. elements for growth. These troughs were covered with a wire grid serving as a support for the plants and itself covered with a light-excluding material such as peat, wood-wool or moss. The solution was maintained at a higher temperature than the air by means of an electric heating cable, and was renewed at intervals when absorption by the plants had lowered the con centration of salts below a certain level. Dr. Gericke claimed to obtain astonishing yields by this method, to which the name ‘hydroponics’ has been applied. Attempts to use this system in the Eastern United States and in England were not marked by anything like such success. Plants were grown to maturity, it is true, and sometimes yields were a little better than in soil, but often the plants failed to thrive. The outstanding difficulty seemed to be that the roots, being immersed in the solution, did not get sufficient oxygen to work properly, and the complication of thoroughly and continuously aerating the solution by mechanical means greatly increased the cost of installation. Workers in these areas have turned more and more, therefore, to the development of methods depending upon growing the plants in some inert material such as sand, gravel, or even cinders, the solution being applied at intervals either as a surface spray, or by flooding from below by means of an electric pump connected with a supply reservoir at a lower level into which the solution returns after use. In either case the draining down of the solution ensures the thorough aeration of the aggregate, while sufficient solution is retained on the surface of the particles of the medium to last the plants until the next application. Very successful results have sometimes been achieved with both of these methods, but continued experiment, especially on a large scale, is necessary before it can be definitely stated that the system is an economic proposition. That satisfactory crops can be produced is certain, though greatly enhanced yields in comparison with normal cultivation in soil are not to be looked for. Economy of labour would appear to be the chief economic advantage, since the system can be made largely automatic and such labour-consuming opera tions as winter digging, soil sterilization, surface cultivations and hand-watering are done away with, while quality of crop seems to be improved in many cases. In England, the cost of installation of the necessary tanks, pumps, etc., makes it likely that the idea can only be applied on a commercial scale to the production mainly of high-value glasshouse crops, but in other parts of the world, where difficulties connected with the soil or the water supply militate against normal methods, systems of outdoor soilless cultivation may be the only practicable way to grow crops. Professor R. H. Stoughton, of Reading University- who has been working on the problem for some years, recently flew out to the Middle East at the request of the Air Ministry, with their Chief Horticultural Officer, Mr. C. H. Eastop, to investigate the possi bilities of soilless cultivation on desert air stations in such areas as Iraq and the Persian Gulf. Fresh foods such as tomatoes and lettuces cannot easily be pro duced locally, cither through lack of water or because of unsuitable soil, and have to be flown in from Palestine or Egypt, often arriving limp and stale and costing a great deal in freight. It would do much for health and morale if crops of this nature could be produced actually on the stations themselves, and soilless cultivation methods, using as they do the minimum of water, might well be the answer. Strangely enough, the biggest difficulty in the desert is to find any suitable sand; desert sand is more in the nature of wind-blown dust and is too fine for free drainage. In the Persian Gulf, however, plenty of coral is avai'able and experiments are being started to see if crops can be grown in graded crushed coral contained in long narrow troughs, with the nutrient solution applied fr &gt;m perforated pipes running theMONTHLY SCIENCE NEWS No. 5 57 5 ! 94 6 p connected to which the the draining i aeration of retained on n to last the een achieved experiment, »efore it can in economic oe produced i comparison e looked for. &gt;e the chief in be made ning opera- ion, surface ly with, while many cases, he necessary he idea can e production &gt;ut in other nected with linst normal ivation may University, some years, the request lorticultural e the possi- r stations in Fresh foods sily be pro- r or because vn in from id stale and lo much for re could be iselves, and hey do the wer. n the desert is more in fine for free plenty of eing started mshed coral the nutrient running the length of the beds.

A good deal has been heard of 1 hydroponic gardens ’ run by the Americans on Ascension Island in the Atlantic and on Wake and other islands in the Pacific, but official details are hard to come by, though there seems no doubt that considerable success has been achieved. I he time is not yet when we can think of dispensing with soil, even in our glasshouses, but it looks as if soilless methods have come to stay, as complements to normal methods, for special crops or in areas where the usual means of cultivation are difficult or im possible. (MSN) the dimensional changes which were due partly to varying moisture content of the wood, and partly to the effect of heat treatment in the final ‘ curing As each wooden jig became distorted from these causes after eight or nine mouldings, the expenditure of time and man-power was very high. The experimental production of concrete jigs was therefore put in hand, and the Building Research Station, together with the consulting engineer of the firm concerned, assumed responsibility for the selection of suitable concrete mixes, the design of the formers and cages, and the design and super vision of the moulding, curing, surface treatment, etc., of the first completed fuselage jig. The procedure ultimately adopted was as follows: The two master pattern jigs (port and starboard, each divided into six sections) were furnished with metal strips affixed to the surface. The plaster mould (shown in Fig. 2 being lifted from one section of the pattern jig) became appropriately recessed thereby, and was used to locate a large number of wooden inserts, to be later cast integrally with the concrete. A wooden core was specially designed to avoid giving harmful changes of cross-section in the finished mould. Contrary to expectations, it was found possible to use a rather stiff concrete mix, and to mould in stages, with ramming. This resulted in a product having a high strength and a low shrinkage. After setting under damp sacking for twenty-four hours, and standing for three days, the moulded jigs could be stripped (Fig. 3) and placed in position on a rigid understructure for use in shaping the fuselage. The wooden inserts, after planing flush with the concrete surface, allowed the plywood sheets to be tacked in position for the final gluing and curing by heated metal strips (Fig. 4 on next page). Because of the rigid steel framework for the plaster mould, and the reinforcing steel in the concrete (i-2 per cent by weight), both the expansion of the plaster and Fig. 2.

At that time it was impossible, for security reasons, to discuss the very considerable progress made in the chemical investi gation of penicillin. The ban on publication has now been partially lifted and, pending the completion of a detailed Anglo-American monograph on the subject, a summary of the progress made up to the end of 1945 has been issued jointly by the British Medical Research Council and the U.S. Committee on Medical Research. The full report was published in Nature (29 December 1945). The report shows that penicillin must now be regarded as a generic rather than a specific name. At least four different forms are known to exist; they are known in Great Britain as penicillins I, II, III and K, and in the United States, whose scientists colla borated in the w r ork from 1942 onw r ard, as penicillins F, G, X and K. The gener - N H ally accepted structural formula of penicillin is shown on the right. nn q The four penicillins* 1 differ in the nature of the q Fig. 4 . Forming the fuselage Group R in the formula. In peni cillin 1 group R is A 2 -pentenyl; in II group R is benzyl; in III group R is p- hydroxy benzyl; and in K group R is rc-heptyl: ■ Though these; four forms are chemically so} closely related they differ sig nificantly in their anti-bacterial ac tivities. Ordinary commercial peni cillin generally consists largely of penicillin II with a small proportion of penicillin 111 . 'The latter has been pre pared in a concentrated form and has been reported| to be as much as twice as active against certain bacterial species, including strains of pneumococci and strepto cocci, a*s penicillin 11. Although it is concerned chiefly with an account of;. the degradation of penicillin to recognizable smaller molecules, the report shows that all the major fragments of the penicillin molecule have been synthesized. 'The final goal of synthesizing the molecule as a whole has, however, not yet been achieved. There is no doubt, from the vigour w r ith which the work is being pursued and the number of eminent chemists associated with it, that this problem too will eventually be solved. Successful synthesis in the laboratory w r ould not however, necessarily imply any immediate possibility of synthetic penicillin being more easily and cheaply manufactured than the natural product.

In Bahrain European vegetables can be grown in the normal way for seven months in the year without much difficulty, during the other five months of the year local vegetables are available. At no time during the year are no vegetables procurable in Bahrain. I would have liked to experiment with soil-less gardening but if it were done here it would require the attention of a knowledgeable person and at present I have nobody who could afford the time to undertake such work. I consider that it would only be of use if it was carried out on a large scale so that a substantial quantity of vegetables could be grown during those months in the summer when European vegetables are unobtainable. v7 -T- ^ ' V 7 Adviser to the Government S.Z © Vcopy ARABIAN AMERICAN OIL COMPANY Dhahran, Saudi Arabia October 28 , 194-6 SOIL-LESS GARDENING File: 716.0 Mr.E.Packer, Manager, Petroleum Concessions Limited, Bahrein Island.

ARABIAN AMERICAN OIL COMPANY By Sgd. \ epd/NCSCOPY THE OFFICE OF THE AIR STAFF LIAISON OFFICER, BAHREIN Ref: ASLO/107/8/Org 10th November 194-6. HYDROPONICS Sir I am enclosing herewith some notes on the experi ments on soil-less cultivation carried out at Habbaniya together with two drawings CE/RAF/230/4-5 and 290/45, illustrating the arrangements of the installation set up for the experiment. 2. It will be noticed that the experiments have not yet reached a final stage but that they appear to be promising. 3. The Chief Engineer points out that the difficulty in keeping the perforated pipes for distributing the nutrient fully effective does not appear to have been mentioned in the notes. The perforations tend to clog and the rate of dis tribution through them is apt to vary between different parts of the trough. It is suggested that spraying with watering cans would probably ensure a better distribution of the solution. Though care must be taken not to allow the chemicals on the leaves of the growing plants. 4. The ^hief Engineer, Group Captain A.J.Dow, will be only too pleased, to show representatives of I.P.C. details of the experiments at Habbaniya. (Sgd.) P.R.M.WILLIAMS Wing Commander.

The object of soil-less cultivation in IRAQ is to produce succulent vegetables and salads throughout the hot summer months for consumption at R.A.F. Stations. Hitherto it has been found very difficult and in some cases a complete failure to grow this type of crop using the normal methods of cultivation and irrigation. METHOD 2. There are two main types of systems (i) Culture in in a solution contained in a water proof tank, tray or other shallow receptacle with the roots more or less permanently immersed in the liquid. (ii) Culture in a permanent medium such as sand or gravel, cinders or other inert material, with the nutrient solution supplied at short intervals so that the roots are immersed in the solution only for short periods, and obtain their supplies of water and nutrients for the most part from the film of solution setting the particles of the medium. 3. The sand type of culture is in use at Habbaniya but care has to be taken that the nutrient solution is not lost in the drainage water and that the correct moisture content is maintained. It also cannot be operated as automatically as can the sub-irrigation method but the capital cost of the installation is lower. 4- The construction of the dosage tanks can be in con crete and brickwork for a sand culture type of installation and a layout is shewn on Drawing No.CE/RAF/290/45 attached^ Provided there is a piped water supply there is no need for a 9&gt;600 gallon main tank but the 800 gallon to each pair of troughs should be installed so that the amount of water used for watering can be determined. 5. In the management of a sand culture installation it is first necessary to determine the saturation point of the sand in order that the exact amount of chemicals to be added can be determined. The chemicals used are those that supply the elements needed for plant growth and are absorbed by the roots. In addition to water these are mainly nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, sulphur and iron. In addition, plants require relatively minute quantities of, ma^Ly, salts and sulphates, boron, manganese, copper and, possibly, zinc. If pure chemicals are these latter elements will have to be added separately, but crude chemicals contain sufficient of the elements, with the possible exception of boron. 6. It should be noted that in the summer most plants require more nitrogen and less potassium. In the winter the reverse is the case. Most plants grow best in a slightly acid solution: for example tomatoes require a Ph. value of about 6.5 and potatoes 4.5 - 5.0 . A good average to startwith mind is a Ph. value of 6.0 and then experiment bearing in that a Ph. value of 7.2 is the neutral of this value. 7. A mixture of various fertilizers has been received from the United Kingdom and contains the following (a) Nitrate of Soda 10 lbs. (b) Sulphate of Potash 2i (c) Triple super phosphate (d) Magnesium sulphate 3% ' (e) Calcium sulphate ' plus trace of elements such as boron, etc. 8. 2 ^ lbs. of this mixture should be used with 100 gallons of water to obtain the recommended concentration. A trace of iron should be used as a solution once a week just before irrigation. Care must be taken to mix this solution only immediately before irrigation as the iron precipitates very rapidly. A suggested rate of application is -J- lb. to 100 gallons of water. 9. In the experiments carried out at HABBANIYA purified water has been used for irrigation. The method of purifica tion is briefly as follows Water drawn from R. Euphrates is passed through primary settling tanks and then through coagulation and sedimentation tanks: the coagulation medium is sulphate of alumina, average dose 2 grains per gallon: the water is then passed under pressure through sand filters: finally chloramination is carried out by pressure feeding chlorine gas at a rate of 200 parts per million, into the water mains so as to give a final excess chlorine of 0.3 parts per million. 10. Generally speaking the plants grown should follow local practice to start with but it should also be possible to arrange transplanting and inter-cropping. In the early stages of the growth of plants they should be given an irrigation of nutrient solution once a week. Water should be given when required but in a temperature of 100 deg. F., or over it has appeared that the sand dries out in 3 to 4 days. Under 100 deg. F. watering has been done at approx imately 7-day intervals. The amount of water or nutrient solution given at any one time should only be sufficient to saturate the sand without appreciable excess. 11. The growth and appearance of the plants are the surest guide to the suitability of the nutrient solution. If plants grow slowly and are abnormally light green in colour the nitrogen content in the solution should be increased 250 parts per million or even more. Conversely, if plant growth is very rapid and weak and for example, tomatoes fail to flower or set fruit the potassium supply should be increased. It is suggested that the stages of increase or decrease of the chemicals should be in stages of 50 parts per million. Phosphorus deficiency, though unlikely, will be signalised by a dull appearance of the leaves, stunted growth and often the appearance of purplish colourations. 12. Planting of tomatoe and lettuce seeds was carried out on the 4th September at the small experimental installation at Habbaniya. Good germination appeared on the secondly and they have progressed well. It is anti cipated that the lettuce should be ready for eating on the 4th November approximately. On the 18th October the 'irst flowers were observed on the tomatoe plants and it is anti cipated that tomatoes will be ready for eating about two- 3 - months from the date of flowering providing they are not caught by frost before then. 13. No screening from the sun or any sheltering at night time has yet been used. It appeared a fortnight after planting that growth was better where one portion of the tank was screened from the afternoon sun by a pomegranate tree. However, on the 30th September the branches of the pomegranate tree were lopped as it was noticed that growth in the shaded area had slowed down and was less than that of plants receiving the full strength of the sun throughout the day. 14. As young leaves on succulent vegetables have proved to be a delicacy for birds a screen of light chicken wire was placed over the top of the sand culture tank. As growth continued above the top of the tank walls the screens had to be removed but no trouble has been noticed since. 15. An alteration from the original design has been made, in that the sprinkler pipes have been lowered to the top level of the sand. This was done to prevent the nutrient solution burning the young plants. 16. Some method of supporting the tomatoe plants will have to be found when they are in fruit. The bed of the tank is covered with a hardcore surface for adequate drain age and it is not possible to fix stakes into this material. 17. M In summing up it may be stated that soil-less cultivation is a success in IRAQ, from the point of view that vegetables can be frown. To provide sufficient fresh vegetables for a large community it would be necessary to build a big installation. It is also preferable for someone with a knowledge of the action of chemicals on plants growth to be available. It is possible that the combination of chemicals that has proved successful at HABBANIYA during the period of the experiments may not suit other climatic conditions but this can only be found out and a correct combination arrived at by experiment. 18. Seeds and chemicals were not available in IRAQ and had to be imported. The length of time taken for these items to be obtained from either U.K. or India should be borne in mind if an installation is set up else where. 19. At BAHREIN a typical analysis of the well water is as follows :- 20. The high contents of calcium sulphate and magnesium chloride should be harmless to soil-less cultivation and will mean that it should be unnecessary to supply extra calcium and magnesium in a nutrient solution. The quantities present in the water are more than sufficient for any plants need of these essential elements. Parts per 100,000 (a) Calcium carbonate. (b) Calcium sulphate.
