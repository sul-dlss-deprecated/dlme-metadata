It therefore contains a range of records concerning orders, deliveries, payments, related correspondence, and internal agency notes. Most of the supplies are acquired — prior to Indian Independence in 1947 — from either the Royal Indian Dockyard or Army and Naval Stores Limited, both in Bombay. Following independence, supplies are acquired direct from Foreign Office Departments; the principal officers involved being the Naval Store Officer and the Controller of Naval Accounts in Bombay. In addition to procuring supplies for the Bahrain Agency, there is also a little correspondence reflecting its role in distributing flags to the subordinate Trucial Coast Agency, along with a little correspondence on the topic with the Persian Gulf Political Residency.Also contained in the file on folios 165-166 are instructions dated 28 October 1947, from the Persian Gulf Political Residency, regarding the flags to be used by diplomatic and consular officers.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Army and Navy Co-operative Society</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Army and Navy Stores Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Naval Store Officer, Bombay</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Controller of Naval Accounts, Bombay</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Flags</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00015c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
