With reference to Lewisohn’s letter of 3rd June, P.C.£8/367, and our subsequent conversations regarding the Sharjah political agreement, I now enclose a copy of this draft agreement after revision on the basis of Lewi solin's letter and of further consultations between the Department concerned. As you will see, there are the following differences from the draft as sent to Lewisohn v/ith my letter of £6th May. ^ - r In Article 3 we do not quite like the wording of the Company’s suggestion, and we think it will be simplest merely to provide for the consent of His Majesty's Government or of the political Resident to be given, leaving us to decide which consent shall be given in which cases. In practice the Resident will, roughly speaking, deal with Asiatics, while non-British Europeans uongrigg, Esq., * // f % troleum Goncessions Limited, ,.c , City-Gate House, E.C.3. 2 and/* ^ l 2. /V t'W /Asla-% CLj$-*-A~* t* , tv C’/*'*'!*^ ^ tA and Americans will have to be approved in London, as is done at present in connection with the other concessions. * The end of Article 6 has been altered, since its appearance in the form sent to the Company on 25th May v/as tne result of a misunderstanding here. The present form is the same as the Debai form, with the wording made slightly more precise. The reference to instructions by the Political PLesident relates, of course, to the period before general regulations are made by the Sheikh (at present, of course, there are no general aircraft regulations on the Trucial Coast similar to those in Bahrein). In Article 7 we have introduced the first of the Company’s suggested amendments but not the second, which does not seem to us to fit, since the sites in question are in no way comparable to harbours. Yie have, however, inserted a reference to the use of aerodromes or seaplane bases. I think you will find that this article satisfactorily effects what Lewisohn’s suggested amendments were intended to effect. We have omitted Article 11 on the advice of our legal people, who have pointed out that it is really i *?YT&gt;7,h- superfluous/ T / ,superfluous, since the relationship between tne commercial concession and the political agreement is primarily laid down in the exchange of notes and it would be tidier to have the whole thing done in the exchange of notes. Article 11 being emitted from the political ? agreement, it will merely be necessary to alter paragraph ^3 (b) of the relevant draft note to the Sheikh so that the sentence in brackets will read 'which it is hereby agreed shall be applicable to the case’’ instead of 'which is made applicable to the case by Article 11 of the agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government'. As regards the amendment suggested by the Company in subclause (4) of the pre-emption clause, His Majesty o Government prefer not to make this addition. whilst there is no disposition on their part to suggest that a transfei price for oil sold to shareholders at a privileged r^to would represent 'a fair price' for preemption purposes, they are anxious not to debar in advance any person who might be charged with the duty of fixing a lair price from access to all data which might possibly be relevant.The exchange of notes would he the same as those 4. exchanged with the Sheikh of Debai, subject to the amendment noted above, except that it will be unnecessary to bring in Petroleum Concessions Limited, as the political agreement in the present instance is with Petroleum Developnent (Trucial Coast) Limited. Will you kindly confirm that the Company have no further observations to make in regard to these documents ? Meanwhile the necessary steps are being taken to seek authority for the signature of the political agreement on behalf of His Majesty’s Government by an Under-Secretary at this Office. As I have informed you orally in reply to your enquiries, we understand from the Political Resident that it is the case that the Sheikh of Sharjah is raising difficulties over his recognition of the political agreement and over the exchange of notes. The Political Agent is, however, in ccmmunication with the Sheikh on the matter, and we will let you know the outcome as soon as possible. Yours sincerely, (Sd.)

WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 4th August, 193^ Dear Warner Would you please refer to paragraph- No.5 of Bushire telegram of 22nd July, No.T/109, of which a copy was sent to you on the 23rd July, P.Z. 4817/37, about Trucial Coast Oil. In that paragraph the Resident suggests that the Standard Oil Company should he informed as soon as possible of the communications which have been made to the Sheikhs of Sharjah, Ras-al-Khaimah and Umm-al-Qaiwain. These communications were, of course, to the effect that His Majesty's Government are prepared to approve concessions granted to Petroleum Concessions Limited but are not prepared to consider permitting the Sheikhs to negotiate with any other Company. 2. We have looked again at the correspondence with Mr. Ballantyne, of which copies were sent to the Foreign Office on the 17th December, 1936, (P.Z.8679/36), the R. Warner, Esq., Foreign Office. 28 th/28th De er, 1936, ( P.Z. 9080/36), the 2nd Jan &lt;f»l ( P.Z •9080/36), and the 31st March, 1937, ( P.Z. 1871/37). The last of these papers is Mr. Ballantyne's letter of 19th March in which he confirmed that the Standard Oil Company ’’are interested, and will continue to he interested, in negotiating for oil concessions within the Trucial Oman coast area, if and whenever an opportunity occurs for themi to do so with the consent of His Majesty’s Government’ - ' • 3. In the light of the correspondence and, in particular, of this paragraph in Mr. Ballantyne’s letter of 19th March, we are inclined to think that it is unnecessary to say any more at this stage to the Standard Oil Company, despite the fact that the option at Ras-al-Khaimah has now expired. It would clearly he quite improper for the Company to start negotiating with any of the Rulers without informing His Majesty’s Government of their intention, and if they were to do so we should he in a very strong position. On the other hand, to make a further communication to them at this stage, without any particular peg to hang it on to, might merely cause unnecessary/®r unnecessary irritation and argument. 4 . we should he glad to know as soon as possible whether the Foreign Office concur in our view. am sending copies of this letter to Starling and Seal.

He has passed this information on to Mr.Lermitte, and has asked the latter to tell him what are our maximum terms for those Sheikhdoms and for Ras-al- Khaimah.

Mr. Lermitte and his party called on the ohaikh of Sharjah at 10,00 hours. During their call they asked the Shaikh of Sharjah to let them know about the points of difference between him and the Government in case they may be able to help him. The Shaikh said that he settled the Concession with the Company and had nothing it to discuss with them about/and that the Political Agreement was one to be settled between him and the Government. Kanu insisted that the Shaikh should inform him about the points of diiference so that he could mediate between him and the Government. Kanu said to the Shaikh that there was no necessity for him to hide things as he (Kanu) had a copy of the Political Agreement. The Shaikh than asked Kanu about its contents and other things connected with it/ Kanu said there was nothing whereupon the Shaikh said that there were four letters to be exchanged and as Kanu knew nothing about them he dia no o even know about the Political Agreement. 20th August. At 11.45 party left for Ajman accompanied by Muhammad bin Bajab (cousin of Khan Sahib Husain). They returned in the afternoon and went back in the evening to dine with the Shaikh. No business was discussed At 20.300 hours Mr. Lemitte called on me and said that the ohaikh of Sharjah had told him that he had written to me four letters stating in them the points to which he objected in the Political Agreement. I told Mr. Lermitte that the Shaikh did not write four letters to me and thought that the Shaikh meant to say that there were four letter to be exchanged.exchanged. I also told Mr. Lermitte that the Political Agent had discussed the Political Agreement with the Shaikh and that the Shaikh did not then nor has he yet accepted the exchange of letters. I also told Mr. Lermitte that the latest attitude of the Shaikh and his desire for money leads me to believe that he will soon agree to the exchange of letters. 21st August 1937. At 08.00 hours the party accompanied by Muhammad bin Rajab left for Ras A1 Khaimah. Mr. Lermitte informed me that they were all well received by the Shaikh who also took them to Khatt spring. They returned from Ras A1 Khaimah at 20.00 hours. No business was discussed. At 21.00 hours they visited the Sha?kh of Sharjah. They again spoke to the Shaikh about the Political Agreement. Kanu asked the Shaikh to tell him of the points of difference and suggested that if the Government were on the wrong side he would tell them so, so that they may agree with the Shaikh. Kanu asked his clerk to ask Mr. Lermitte (in English) for the Political Agreement and letters so that he may be able to see the points of difference and discuss that them with the Shaikh. Mr. Lermitte said ve/the Shaikhs of Qatar Kuwait and IXibai had accepted the Political Agreement which is in the interest of the Shaikh and the Company and without which the Company could not sign the concession. The Shaikh said that he was ready to sign if the Company could get him permission to sign the Concess^c without being bound by the Political Agreement. Mr. Lemitte said that it was not possible. 1 Abdullah bin Paris suggested that he hoped the Shaikh will soon come lo an agreement with the Government. 3d. A. Razzaq.

The Shaikh preferred not to discussyil a Concession until the expiration of the option period which expired on the 22nd of January 1938# Mr*Lermitte paid the Shaikh a courtesy call and no discussion took place* )dr*Lermltte is proposing to interview the Shaikh again in the near future* SAS-AI^KHAmAH* Mr*Leroitte has been negotiating with this Shaikh for five or six days* Mr* 1*01101 tte had succeeded in reducing the Shaikh’s large demands to a form which would /3- 6 &gt; would probably have been acceptable to hie Company by the evening of September 8th* The only major question remaining was the financial clause* The following day the Shaikh's Secretary informed Hr*Lermitte that the Shaikh had changed his mind and was again insisting on the majority of his original demands* Ur*Lermitte then came to Sharjah to see me but is proposing to return to Ras-al-Khaimah and again tackle the Shaikh# 2* I have discussed the situation generally with Id Mr*Lermitte and he has given me^/Shaikh of Bas-al Khaimah's terms to read through* As an indication of the type of demand that he is making it will suffice if 1 state that he asks for a 20 per cent interest in the Company, for one thaousand rifles and one hundred thousand rounds of S.A.A*, for the establishment of a school, for the appoint ment of his representative at a salary of £*600 gold(this amount was not written but was verbally communicated to Mr.Lenaitte) and he claimed the right te try all foreigners in the local courts* As I have pointed out before c the Shaikh is not absolutely nonnal^and is influnced by a self seeking Najdi Qadhi who has compiled these demands from all the Concessions that have been concluded in this part of the world of which the Shaikh has obtained copies* I hope that Mr•Lermitte can bring the Shaikh to reason but 1 very doubtful and expect that we shall ourselves be forced te take action to persuade the shaikh to see reason if we are to ensure that the Concession goes to a British Company within a reasonable period of time# 3* with regard to the Sharjah difficulty of the alteration of Article 3(a) which is,I understand, the only difficulty in the way of signing the Sharjah Concession, I would like to point out that in my opinion the article might /might well be excluded entirely* It appears to have been put in as a safe guard in case any point had been overlooked in the agreement between the Company and the Shaikh which might not be to the advantage of His Majesty's Government as the agreement between the Company and the Shaikh cannot be signed without His Majesty's Government's approval and a* U' is carefully scrutinized by us before signature and ease be, if it is not already, examined by the India Office Legal experts there should be no flaw in it if the examination has been carefully doom and there would be no ” inconsistency or conflict 4* The Shaikh of Ajman's area is so small that he is not considered to be of primary importance* I have no comment to make in the case of tts-al-Qaiwain* In regard to Abu Dhabi I have told Mr*Leroitte that I consider that Shaikh Khalifah bin Zaid has considerable influence in Abu Dhabi and that he would do well to take any opportunity that offered to discuss the question with Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan in the presence of Shaikh Khalifah bin Zaid even though it be necessary to go to Buraimi to do so« I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant* Captain, Political Agent,Bahrain*ftp Conf idential .

The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, /I ' V 6° I have the honour to refer to ny letter No. T/200 dated Sharjah, the 10th September 1937. 2. On the evening of the 11th September, the Resi dency Agent informed me that the Shaikh of Sharjah had sent his Secretary Abdullah bin Faris to him and stated that he wished to communicate to me the fact that he agreed unconditionally to the Political Agreement and the exchange of letters. I immediately sent word to the Shaikh of Sharjah that I would see him at once. He arrived at about 6 p.nu accompanied by his Secretary and stated to me that in view of the excellent relations which had always existed between himself and the British Govern ment and his fervent wish to further these relations he had decided that he would accept the Political Agreement without alteration and the exchange of letters. He fur ther stated that he regretted the amount of time which had elapsed and he trusted that we would realise that it was entirely due to the fact that he was unaccustomed to dealing with documents such as those with which he had been confronted. I thanked him for his decision and asked him if I could rely entirely on what he had now told/-Political Agent, Bahrain l told me. He stated that most certainly I could rely on it and that I had his word which he would not go back on and that he was writing that evening to his cousin the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah to inform him of the decision as they had been in agreement over this matter. This accept- % ance was made in public and formally and^binding in every way on the Shaikh of Sharjah. 3. I immediately wrote to Mr. Lermitte and informed him of the Shaikh^ decision and I further informed him that the Shaikh of Sharjah had addressed the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah and that I thought that this would have 4 considerable bearing on his negotiations. I had been under the inpression for some time that an arrangement existed between these two Shaikhs and was glad to find my opinion confirmed. For it means that the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah would be more likely to come to an agreement with Petroleum Concessions Limited now that the Shaikh of Sharjah has left him to stand alone. 4. I informed the Shaikh of Shar jah that I would communi cate with you with a view to my returning to Sharjah on Thursday or Friday, September 16th or 17th, for the signa ture of the Concession Agreement and that I would let him know as soon as I had your orders. This information was also conveyed in ny letter to Mr. Lermitte at Has al Khai mah. I arranged that the Shaikh of Sharjah's letter to with Petroleum Concessions Limited should be carried by the same messenger who carried my letter to Mr. Lermitte. the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah on the subject of his agreement I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant.

City-Gate House, Finsbury Square, London, E. C. 2. 20th September, 1937, My dear Claus on, \^c Many thanks for your letter F.Z.6133/37 of September 17th. Monsieur Pomeyrol would, according to cur 1 , b-. on the Trucial Coast as assistant to Mr. T.F.Williamson and. I cannot feel that his presence should appreciably affect the sentiments of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, even if the latter were aware that Pomeyrol was not an Englishman. If he conceived serious doubts as to the British character of P.C.L. they could, I imagine, be dispelled without difficulty by the Political Authorities and ourselves. Even if Abu Dhabi continued to have his suspicions, even this might not be quite fatal, since non-British concerns (in the person of our Californian friends) do not seem in the past to have been considered by the Trucial Shai.dis as altogether impossible candidates for their favours. At the moment of writing it is not quite certain that we shall think it worth while sending a geological party on to the Trucial Coast this year at all, their right of acce.jo to the more interesting areas (which are on the side remotest from Abu Dhabi) being doubtful: but if we do, we should definitely like T.P.'Williamson and Pomeyrol to form the party - unless, of course, you forbid it.

The remainder was submitted to London at the request of the Ruler so that they might go through them again and if possible concede on certain rinor points. Before doing this T had pointed out to the Ruler that thjre was no hope of them altering their decision in respect of certain of his demands. T have now received a detailed reply to my reports end have been given the power to de cide within certain limits suggested alterations to a nuir.ber of the clauses in the Agreement as it now stands. London Office have instructed me to submit to you all al terations or additions before T give the Ruler the Com pany' s final acceptance.

In order to save time I will send you in full any alterations or additions agreed upon as and when this is done. They chiefly consist of extra benefits in favour of the Ruler and. in several cases are simply a change in the phraseology. The only real difficulty I foresee is getting him to agree to the clauses which affect the Poli tical. as for some reason or other the Ruler is firmly convinced that* the Company is a Government concern. During my last visit to the Residency Agent he suggested that it might be advisable if he did not visit the Rulerswith whom I an negotiating unless he has definite business with them and I think this is a very good idea as they all rather resent the fact that they are under an obligation to H.B.r.G.

Weightman, Esquire, I- C. S-, Political Agent, Bahrain &gt; The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have nour to refer to my printed letter No. C/768-10/12 dated the 13th of October 1937 and to enclose a copy of a letter which I have received from Mr. B.H. Lermitte on the 14th of October 1337. 2. As I was not in possession of the latest draft of the Ras al Xhaimah Concession I applied to Mr. E.V. Packer, the Local Manager of the Petroleum Concessions Limited, for two copies, one for retention in this office and one to be sent to you. Mr. Packer informed me that he him self had no copy of the Concession and he cabled to Mr. Lermitte at Dubai for two copies to be sent by air mail. Mr. Lermitte replied that he only had five copies himself all of which were required to be signed by himself and the Shaikh if and when the Shaikh agreed to the Concession. it could always be returned by air mail to Sharjah in an emergency and at the same time he informed me that the current Ras al Khaimah Concession on which he was working was identical with the Agreement made with the Shaikh of Dubai on the 22nd of May 1937, except for Article 1, which He , therefore, was forwarding one copy for my use here as did/-did not include any restricted area and Article 5 in which the figures had not yet been entered. I have carefully compared the two agreements and they are identical with the exceptions noted by Mr. Lermitte. I enclose a copy of Article 1 (a) and (b) of the Has al Khaimah Concession and I suggest that in order to save delay the Bushire copy of the Dubai Concession Agreement be used for conqparison when considering the amendments. 3. I have examined the proposed amendments and have the following observations to make:- Article 8 . No comment. Article 9(a) » no comment beyond a suggestion that the intention be more clearly ex pressed. Article _2£c). The result of the present Article 9(c) and the suggested substitute will be the same but presumably the Shaikh is objecting to Article 9(c), as the Political Agent, Bah rain, is given certain powers there under . Article 10. Article life) . Article 15(a ). No objection, provided the reference to passport fees is excluded. This is a matter solely for the Com pany to decide. The deletion of the words w Buy or* and *Purchase or* is in accordance with the Sharjah and Dubai Conces sions and I have no comments to offer. No comments to offer on the remain - ing amendments to Section 13(a) and (b). Article 17(b) . No comment. Article 21 . No comment. Article 24(e) i do not understand why the Shaikh wishes *Baghdad* to be substituted for ^London*, except as an indica tion of his growing anti-British feelings/--3- ff)'? Article 25. Article 26. feelings. We should, in my opinion, insist that the place of arbitration in default of agreement between the two parties shall be London. The proposed alteration merely re sults in making the clause slightly more ineffective. However I see no need to object to this. The addi tion at the end of the Article is, however, unsuitable in this place and if an amendment of this sort is required, it should properly be in serted somewhere in Article 5. On comparing this Draft Agreement with the one already signed at Du bai, i note an error that the Com pany have made, i.e. •Sultan*s con fidential person** inserted instead of w Shaikh* s confidential person* in the fourth line from the end of this article. 4. I now come to the second half of Mr. Lermitte*s letter which starts on page 2. Paragraph 1. Assuming that the meaning of this paragraph is that if the Company deems it necessary to import arms it will apply to the Political au thorities, no comment is required. But if the meaning is that the Com pany will use its own initiative in importing arms and will only apply for permission if it feels so in clined, then I consider it essential to make it clear that permission must be obtained from the Political autho rities before any arms or ammunition are imported into Has al Khaimah. Paragranh 2. The Shaikh of Sharjah ins drilling period and this sonable request. Paragraph 3. No comment on substance, be more clearly worded. Paragraph 4. No comment. Paragraph 5. No comment. Paragraph 6. No comment. Paragraph 7. No comment at this stage. Paragraph 8. I consider that we should foreign employees not being tried by the/--4- Paragraph Paragraph IQ , Paragraph 11 « Paragraph 12 . the local courts and that the provisions of Article 10 should remain unaltered. A further indication of the Shaikh’s objection to having anything to do with or being under the general control of the Political authori ties. No comment. No comment. I entirely agree with what Mr. hermitte»s London Office have stated. 5. The following are my predecessor’s comments. Mr. Lermitte appears to have taken the correct course with re gard to the letters which Haji Abdullah Williamson is alleged to have been sending to the Rulers of Has al Khaimah and Abu Dhabi. The report is interesting in view of the Shaikh of Dubai’s request that Haji Abdullah William son should not be permitted to re-enter Dubai owing to his intrigues and of the statements that were made to me when I visited the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi regarding Haji Abdullah Williamson’s remarks about Major Holmes and the question of Petroleum Concessions Limited not being a British Company. If the allegation made by Mir. Lermitte is true , then I am more convinced than ever that Haji Abdullah Wil liamson should not be permitted to return to the Trucial Coast for any purpose whatsoever . I propose to ask the Residency Agent, Sharjah, confidentially,if he has any information with regard to these letters, but in view of the fact that Mir. Lermitte has written that the statements made in his letter are for my private information only I do not propose to disclose the source of my information to the Residency Agent. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant. Political Agent, Bahrain,Copy of letter dated the 14th October 1937 from T . B*H. Lermitre to Captain T.

T have asked ^London/ 7. o • London Office to formulate e nhrese wherebv the Oo^nonv v - '* it deers it necesssr v/iii enr^.y to Political ^or* perrission to innort arms for the use o** the Guards. The Shaikh is very insistent on this end points out that Imperial Airways* juards at Sharjah are armed by the Company. 2. The Shaikh insisupon a dritliny period and refuses to consider 2 years as the limit as vir s a or ted by Shariah. 3. The Shaikh vr shed to have the sole riyht to nominate the number of guard® and I have suggested ■ to: 'The number of guards and condition of their service will be arranged in talks between the Staler and the Representative of the Company. T^e Shaikh wi±£ shall ‘ provided that such appointments be rec sornbie. 4. The Shalt h at first insisted upon the Company drilling two artesian wells. London have refused to accept this clause and offered the following solution to which the Shaikh hms agreed: M Tf and when th Comoanv is drilling either water we] 1 s or oil wells, as part of it- own operations, it would consider in consult ation with the Shaikh, d r 11in / a water well in a location selected by him'. 5. T^e Shaikh still insists on bnlnr supmlied with 40,000 gallons of retro' and 40,000 gallon of . rc - :^e after a refinery is in operation. London do not wish to give a promise fo'’ the sup ly of refined products if this can be avoided. 6.

As soon, therefore, as you are able to confirm this, and to confirm that H.M.G. desire the agreement between them and the Company on the matter to be, in the case of Sharjah, based on that particular form, of Political Agreement, I shall ascertain and let you know whether the Company will be similarly willing.

Ras al Khaimah . According to discreet enquiries made by me, the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah had been re ceiving letters from Hajji Abdullah Williamson since his departure from the Trucial Coast. These letters were all in connection with Hajji Abdullah’s intention for negotiating for oil on behalf of his Company. In one of these letters I have been given to understand that Hajji Abdullah said that his letters appear to have been intercepted and thus he was afraid to mention anything, but that he intended to come to the Trucial Coast after the month of Ramadhan and then arrange things with the Shaikh. One of these letters was received through Khan Sahib Yusuf Kami, but I have not yet been able to dis cover through whom the others were received. Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Ruler of Ras al Khaimah, wrote a letter which he sent through Khan Sahib Yusuf Kami to Hajji Abdullah in which he welcomed his visit and asked him to let him know the whereabouts of Major Holmes. In one of his letters Hajji Abdullah made an indirect in vitation to the Shaiih of rtas al Khaimah by saying that should the Shaikh intend to visit Basrah or go on pilgri mage via 'Iraq he should put up with him (Abdullah). 3* Abu Dhabi .

Altannatively if this is unsuitable to you he can come by plane arriving Thursday 25th P.M. and leave the following Monday P.M.

GENERAL * At the present juncture it seems highly probable that fchs field operations this season will be confined to work on the Qatar Peninsula* There is a slight possibility that the geologists may require to proceed to parts of the Trucial Coast to wards the end of the season. B. Concessions * 1. Qatar * (a) Prograpime for 1937-1938 * Preparations for Deep Test Drilling about May 1937, (i) Establish a camp at Dohat ez Zakrit. (ii) Examine water situation &amp; drill water well. (iii) Build guarters for European and Indian staf£ Civ) Comnence Deep Test drilling. (b) Relations with Ruler * (i) The Ruler objected to the development of the West coast at the expense of Dohah and wished Dohah to be the base for all operations claiming that this was the purport of Clause VI of the Concession* At this juncture this attitude affected the Company’s proposal to land heavy equipment on the west c oast near Dohat ez Zekrit. The Ruler eventually agreed to the landing of consignments this sea son but reserved the right to reepen the discussion in the future. (ii) Arbitration. The Ruler gbfgwtad claims that the con cession is clear and as his interpreta tions as Ruler of Qatar must be f inal there is no occasion for any arbitra tion. He concedes that any new point arising not included in the concession might have to go to arbitration. He shews a distinct dislike for the subject of arbitration. ! 1 (iii)-140 2 - (iii) The Rulers two Artezian V/ells * This was an obligation entered into by the Company at the time of the conces sion. Last season* s drilling to over 500 ft. failed to produce potable water. The Ruler at first insisted on a fresh attempt this season but later recognized the Company’s argument that the results of the Company’s drilling should be seen before further attempts were justified at the Ruler’s locations. (iv) The Ruler’s Representatives Pay . It was fairly obvious that the Ruler in tends to accept the Company’s offer of Rs. 1000 with a last effort to increase it when Mr. Longrigg visits Qatar in the near future. (v) Strength of Guards . The Company suggested 10 as a suitable number for a small drilling camp. The Ruler ridiculed this as too small but refused to commit himself to a figure. He has since insisted on 20 men and the Company have agreed to this figure pend ing further possible discussions. (c) Final Position at Commencement of Operations . The Ruler has agreed to the Company’s programme and the only unsatisfactory feature is the 20 guards which are considered somewhat excessive and difficult in the early stages to transport and provide for in rations and particularly water. 2. Dubai. Sharjah. Muscat % Dhofar . No field operations this season. Consideration is being given to a scheme for co-operation by the R.A.F. in flights over certain areas including parts of Muscat and Dhofar. Mr. Longrigg is visiting the Sultan of Muscat and Muscat with a view to examining ways and means of pene tration into the hinterland in Muscat and Dhofar. He may also visit parts of the Trucial Coast. He is expected to arrive in December not before the 8th. 3. Ras el Khaimah . Mr. Lermitte reports that the situation is satis factory. Outstanding/-(1937)/. -3- iHf Outstanding demands to date of the Ruler to which the Company was unable to agree werer- (a) Inspector and Representative at combined pay of Rs. 2600 p.m. (Company offers one representative at Rs. 400.;. (b) Free issues of petrol and Kerosene - 40,000 gallons each p.a. (Company offer reasonable personal allowance should (a) and (c) be dropped by the Ruler. (c) 20% of the Company’s profits (Company will not consider this;. (On 22nd November Mr. Lermitte cabled that the situa tion was improved but nothing concrete was mentioned in this cable.) 4. Abu Dhabi . Mr. Lermitte made a preliminary visit. The Ruler asked for a concession on the I.P.C., A.I.O.C, or Kuwait lines. As the Ruler’s uhcle (Khalifah) was away the discussions were concluded. Mr. Lermitte is inclined to leave Abu Dhabi until last. 6 . Ajman . Ajman is inclined to leave discussions until his option period expires - 22/1/1938, although pre pared to conclude a concession. 6 . Umm ai Qaiwain . The Ruler of Umm al Qaiwain stated that he had an understanding with Ras el Khaimah not to negotiate until Ras el Khaimah had signed but that he was willing to grant a concession. 7. K&amp;lba and other minor independent or semi-^euend - ent Rulers . It is understood that no action on options nor concessions is contemplated at present. 8 . Bahrain (unallotted area) . The situation is unchanged since last April, i.e. H.H. the Shaikh is not disposed to re-open the subject under a year from April, 1937. Major Holmes may be coming to Bahrain about the end of this year in/ -4- \ M 'Z- (1937) when he will examine the situation. C. MTSfrEl.TiANSOUS MATTERS. 1. Zubarah . Qatar claims that the ^sanctions” imposed by Bahrain have no effect in that goods and commodities are obtained at 20% lower cost from Dubai. (b) At this juncture it does not seem that the Zubarah controversy is likely to b e aggra vated by the Oil Company taking any interest in the area from the oil point of view. The Political Agent has asked that prior reference be made to him if any activity in the Zpbarah area is contemplated. 2. Hawar Islands &gt; + ** The Bahrain Government have a party in the Hawar Islands. The Company are to work in the vicinity on the Qatar mainland. The possibility (possibly very remote) of friction might be considered with advantage. 3. Movements by Geologists on the Trucial Coast later in the Season . In this event the Political Agent has asked for plenty of notice. P.C.L., Bahrain, 23rd November 1937. I have told Mr. Packer on the telephone that the P.C.L. people must not go to Hawar.

After ccntpliments. 1 have been instructed by His Majesty’s Government to inform you that Petroleum Concessions Limited are approved by them and were the first to engage in negotiations. Petroleum Concessions Limited have already secured concessions from the Shaikhs of Dubai and Sharjah on terms satisfactory to the interests of these Shaikhs and are also offering satisfactory terms for other concessions.

As such, and in view of the impending negotiations between Petroleum Concessions Limited and the Shaikh, it seems necessary that some reply should be sent. It will perhaps be sufficient to inform the Shaikh that the Political Resident's letter No * C/365 dated the 2nd December 1937 represents the considered de cision of His Majesty's Government, that it admits of no argument, and that the Shaikh is expected to abide care fully by the expressed wishes of His Majesty's Government. i ✓vo J (\ Political Agent, Bahrain,(3 /s° m Copy of memorandum No, C/1100-24/2 dated the 11th December 1937 from the Residency Agent, Sharjah to the Political Agent, Bahrain.

Ve could report, with reference to paragraph o of Sir T.vowle’s express letter No.62o-3, dated 12.6.37, the Shaikhs acceptance of the Political Agreement, and the proposed signature of the concession on September 16th so that H.M.G. can get on with the signature of the Political Agreement^ until which the exchange of letters has to be deferred.

With the^Jiception of Art. 11, whic^ is being dropped as superfluous, and will entail an alteration of para 3(b) of the relevant draft letter to tne Shaikh, the alterations are of form rather than oi substance and relate to points affecting the rights of H.M.S. and the Company rather than those of the Shaikh. Moreover the agreement is not one which the Shaikh has to sign, but which he merely has to take cognisance of. it is possible therefore that he may make no difficulties at all.
