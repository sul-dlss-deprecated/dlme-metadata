Note by Colonel E. C. S. Williams, R.E., C.I.E. Mr. Nicolson’s Telegrams, Nos. 193 and 194, of 18th Oetober 1886, and No. 196, of 19th October 1886. It is the desire of the Persian Government that the railway hitherto designed to begin at either Ahwaz or Shuster, and terminating at Burujird, with prospect of extension (see Clause 3, Section 2, of the draft Contract), should be begun at Mohamerah, and be continued to Teheran; and that the proposal to put a steam flotilla on the Karun river should be dropped. The additional railway involved is 137 miles from Shuster on the south, and 229 miles to Teheran on the north ; total, 386 miles. The southern section would traverse a treeless mud flat without wells, drinking water being obtained from the river and ponds. Floods are frequent on this tract&gt;—in spring, from rain, and later from the melting of the snows. The cost may be put at 700,000/. The northern section, from Burujird via Sultauabad (60 miles), and Kum (142 miles) to Teheran (229 miles), would cross mountainous country at heights in places of at least 6,000 feet. The cost may be put at 2,300,000/. Thus the entire scheme would be :— £ From Mohamerah via Ahwaz to Shuster, 137 miles, costing (say) 700,000 From Shuster to Dizful - - - 36 ,, ,, ,, 200,000 From Dizful to Tang-i-fani - * - 77 „ „ „ 600,000 First section, with no great engineering difficulties - - Totals - 250 ,, ,, ,, 1,500,000 Second section, over mountainous country, the passes being up to 7,000 feet. From Tang-i-fani via Khoramabad (79 miles), Burujird (143 miles), Sultan- abad (203 miles), and Kum (285 miles) to Teheran - - - - 272 „ „ „ 4,000,000 Totals - 622 55 „ £5,500,000 Average cost, 9,000/. per mile. The estimated cost of the original scheme being about three millions sterling, the project is now nearly doubled. Financiers, if satisfied with the originally proposed concession as to Customs, would manifestly not be satisfied with it now ; nor would the modi fications in Clauses VI. and VII., Section 1, of draft Contract, suggested by the Persian Government, increase the subsidy in any due proportion, with even the strictest and most enlightened administration of the Customs. As the proposed Controllers of Accounts are distinctly “ excluded from inter- «&lt; £ 0 j. 0 -qq 0 administration , 55 they could only control the accounts of such moneys as are brought to account. Assuming that all moneys received would be brought to account, and that the expense of collection were kept within moderate bounds, the proposals of the Persian Government in revision of Clause VI. might be acceptable to the financiers in the immediate, if not in the distant, future ; and the need for a clause like VII. would cease, the interests of the Company and of the Persian Government being identical. The revision of these clauses, however, will doubtless be referred to the quarter from which the original proposal as to the Customs emanated. ia»87.

The Persian Government might, therefore, accept them with confidence. E. C. S.
