Personal. —Lieutenant-Colonel E. W. €?„ Noel, C.I.E., v sited Khabis in February and Yezd in March. On the afternoon of the 25th April he handed over the charge of the Consulate to Mr. G. A. Richardson, O.B.E., H. M.’s Consul and Assistant Resi dent, Bandar Abbas, and proceeded to Duzdap on the 26th en route to Dera Ismail Khan on transfer. 23. Local officials .—His Highness Seyid Mohamed, Tadayun, Governor-General, Kerman, left for Jiruft on the 3rd February in connection with a motor road to that district. At the end of the month orders for his recall had been received and on the 7th March, on his return from Jiruft, he handed over the charge to Dadras, his assistant, who still continues to officiate. At the end of April, however, the ap*- pointment of His Excellency Mirza Reza Khan, Afshar, to the vacant pest of Gover nor-General, Kerman, was announced from Tehran. 24. A number of changes have taken place, during the three months under report, amongst the Local Officials at Kerman : (а) Mirza Fatullah Khan, Mustaufi, the acting Provincial Director of Finance was relieved by Prince Mohd. Hassan Mirza, Daulatshahi, on the 29th March. ( б ) Yawar Ismail Khan, Da war Panah, on arrival from Shiraz on the 4 th March, took over the acting com mand of the Kerman Brigade. Sarhang Alburz, the permanent Officer Commanding, however, re turned from Lar via Bushire and Bandar Abbas at the close of April. (c) Sarhang Haji Baqer Khan, Qara- ghuzlu, on recall, was relieved at the end of March by Naib Sarhang Mahmood Khan, Kianpur, as Rais -i-Amnieh. {d) Yawar Seyyid Sadiq Khan, the Chief of the Nazmieh, received orders of transfer to Tehran during March and his relief was announced in the person of Yawar Ghulam Hussein Khan, from Bushire. During the latter part of April however orders were received re instating Yawar Seyyid Sadiq Khan at Kerman. (e) Sheikh Murteza , Nahavandi, the Chief of the Court of the First Instance (Bidayat) in Kerman was transferred to Sultanabad in the same capacity and left on the 23rd April. His place has been filled up by Akhgar, the Public Prose cutor of the same Court. Latter’s relief is expected from Tehran. 25. Local Affairs .—In spite of the ru mours in the early part of March that the whole staff of the Adlieh (Justice) Depart ment in Kerman was to be transferred to Ispahan, information was received at the end of April that the jurisdiction of the Kerman Appeal Court would be extended to Yezd and Bandar Abbas from the 22 nd May. Also that an extra Sulhieh Civil Court will be established in Kerman town and paid for by the Municipality. At the present moment there is only one Sulhieh Court in Kerman and though the Judge, Shariat Madari, is well reputed, he is unable to cope with the large volume of cases filed in his Court. 26. The Shah’s Coronation on the 4th Urdi-Bihisht (25th April) was not celebrated owing to intimation from Tehran that it would in future be observed on His Ma jesty’s Birthday, wh ch falls on the 7 th Isfand (27th February). 27. Mukhatib-us-Sultan (Nabavi), former ly the Superintendent, Persian Telegraphs, | Kerman, arrived in Kerman on the 13th February to make necessary preparations for taking over the telegraph office and, lines from the Indo-European Te egraph Department. He left for Duzdab on the' 21 st. 28. Mehravaran, an Inspector of the Finance Ministry, proceeded to Jiruft on the 18th February to enquire into charges of corruption against the Malieh officials there, and returned in the middle of March. Mirza Muhsin Khan, Fikri. the recently appointed financial Agent, Jiruft, was sus pended, and replaced by Tehran by a senior official of the Department. Mehrawaran returned to Tehran on the 23rd April. 29. Faramurzi, an official of the Ministry of Economy, visited Kerman from Tehran during the period under report. He ac companied Mehrawaran to the Capital. 30. The re-assessment of revenues in the; province, in respect of the estates notalready surveyed, was taken in hand by the Finance authorities at the end of March. 3 % of the past ten years’ average income has to be fixed as Government revenues and in cases where this figure works out at less than the present revenue, the old sea e has to be recovered. It is estimated that the Government revenues will increase by 100 to 200 % in the Kerman Province. 31. A batch of about 40 persons, in habitants, it is said, of the Soveit territory adjoining the Persian frontier on the North (Azerbaijan), arrived here in the beginning of April, under a police escort, with instruc tions to the Nazmieh authorities to keep them under surveillance. Ostensibly, it is said that these men are refugees from Russia and the Persian Government do not wish to force them to go back. In reality, however, they are considered to be Bolshevik agents and it is for this reason that Tehran wants them to be watched. They appear to be destitute and the local au thorities have been trying to get them some work. A meeting was held at the Govern ment House some time after their arrival, at which the acting Governor General asked some notables and land-owners to give these men something to do and so help them to get some means of livelihood. The proposal was objected to on the ground that they could leave Kerman at any time and that nobody could accept the responsibility. Some of these men go about doing odd jobs, as barbers, cleaners, etc., while others live practically on begging. Five of them managed to escape from Kerman during the latter part of the month and so far only one of them has been recaptured. 32. Military News— Sartip Naser-ud- Dauleh of the General Staff arrived via Duzdab on the 3rd March in order to make further enepuries into the pending cases of corruption by certain Military officials of the Kerman Brigade. He had to be ad mitted as an indoor patient in the C. M. S. Hospital for over a week. On recovery he proceeded to Bandar Abbas and returned to Kerman on the 5th April, where he still is. 33. Naib Sarhang Shakir Khan, the Officer in Charge of the Conscription De partment. Kerman, proceeded to Tehran on a month’s leave at the end of March and returned on the 30th April. A few days after his departure Naib Sarhang Seyyid Muhsin Khan arrived from Tehran and started making enquiries into the doings of the Conscription Department during the last 3 years. The enquiry still continues and though some petty official* are involved, nothing has been found against Sarhang Shakir Khan. 34. The Kerman Column in Lar is ex pected back in a month’s time though &amp; Officer Commanding, who commanded *&lt;&gt;, has returned to Kerman, vide paragraph 24 (b) above. 35. During the month of March seven Bashakirdis were reported from Bam to have been captured by the troops at Rudbar on suspicion of robbery, hive of these were released on payment of 200 Ts. each and the remaining two were despatched to Kerman. 36. 250 Conscripts recruited at Jiruft and Rudbar arrived at Bam on the 21 st March en route to Iranshahr. 37. According to news from Bam two men from the local Amnieh forces having deserted with their rifles and ammunition, the Rais-i-Amnieh, Bam, wanted to obtain an undertaking from the local Amnieh chief incharge of the Bam-Zahedan section, to pursue and bring them back, but this was refused as the men were said to have fled to Afghan territory. This refusal brought the official concerned into disgrace. 38. All arms and ammunition, including shot guns, are reported from Bam, to have been collected by the Military authorities from the Kuhistan of Namdad and Pusht- i-Gudar. 39. A number of Afghans were reported to have visited the district of Narmashir in the early part of April with the purpose, it is said, of purchasing fire-arms. As they could not obtain these, they bought a number of camels instead. 40. According to an article in the local newspaper, “ Istiqamat ”, the military column sent out by the Military Governor of Baluchistan, Sarhang Mohamed Khan, to collect firearms from Delgan, etc., recovered 7 girls who had been carried away from Narmashir some 18 years ago, by two robbers from the Raisi tribe and sold to the Bameris. The girls were sent back to their relations in Narmashir in the beginning of April. 41. Communications .—Prince Aizaz-us- Sultaneh, the chief of the Road Depart ment in Kerman, proceeded to Tehran on the 1 st February and returned on the 4th March. He talks of having been promised sufficient funds for repairs to the present main trade routes connecting Kerman. A sum of Tumans 20,000 has been promised3 by the Persian Government for the construc tion of a motor road to Khabis, vide para graph 15. The landowners who had pro mised a sum of Ts. 18,000 for this construc- hfl£ion having heard of the Government ... allotment, are now trying to find excuses for going back on their word. The Prince is anxious to collect and spend this amount in addition to the sum of Ts. 20,000 to be provided by Tehran. 42. At the end of March a motor lorry laden with sugar and piecegoods from Bandar Abbas for Sirjan ventured to pro ceed ahead of the convoy escorted by Military, vide paragraph 7. The lorry was ■topped by a band of robbers between Aliabad and Chah Chaguk and an Amnieh guard who happened to be in the car was killed and all the loads in the lorry carried off. 43.

Local Officials. —Reference paragraph 23. His Excellency Mirza Reza Khan, xifshar, arrived from Tehran on the 15 th on which date he assumed charge as Gov ernor-General. He sent his card to the Consulate on the 17th and His Majesty’s officiating Consul called on His Excellency on the 19th. 54. Reference paragraph 25.

Seyyid Ali Khan, Kabir, arrived from Tehran on the 14th a§ Public Prosecutor, Bidayat (Primary) Court, 56. Ali Asghar Khan, Kazimi, Investi gating Judge, left on transfer for Khuzistan, via Tehran, on the 30th. Mirza Ali Khan, Marvazi, of the Adlieh Court is acting for the present. 57. Farzanigan, the Director of Posts and Telegraphs, proceeded to Tehran on leave at the beginning of the month. Pir Muradi, his assistant*is officiating. 58. Local Affairs .—His Excellency Mirza Reza Khan, Afshar, is interesting himself in the projects of bringing water to Kerman tor Khayabans from Kuhpayeh and of importing a spinning mill for Kerman. The first project was originally taken up by MC289FD His Excellency Peernia in 1930, but did not materialize. T he sprnnd projprt wag scheme d by Colonel Noel as mentio ned in Appendix A] The Governor-General held two Tneetmgs at the Government House during the latter part of the month and explained to those invited that a sum of 500,000 tomans was required for the pur pose. So far he has not received hopeful assurances that the money would be forth coming. His Excellency mentioned that the Shah himself was much interested in the scheme and has already approached this Consulate for all possible information on the subject from the records, but it may be interesting to note that, at the first meeting, he remarked to those present that it was inadvisable for the people to have much dealings with foreigners! As regards the water scheme, His Ex cellency seems anxious to import pipes made in California. He was educated in the United States, speaks English fluently with an American accent, and is of pleasant manners. 59. The Ashura (Muharram) processions passed off quietly on the 28th. The pro cessions were very much curtailed and there was no public laceration of the head. The local authorities were active in the district also and at Bam a number of the mourners who had prepared to lacerate their heads were dispersed by the Military who galloped their horses amongst them as the result of which two or three people were injured. 60. On the 2 nd May information was received of the outbreak of a disease, sus- i pected to be cholera, at Kamalabad in the Rafsinjan district. The Health Officer of Kerman proceeded to the spot and as the result of his reports to Tehran an aeroplane (Gouri) arrived from Tehran on the 7 th with four doctors and a quantity of anti- cholera vaccine. The doctors proceeded to Rafsinjan by car and quarantine was established at a distance of 3 miles from the town on the Rafsinjan road and inoccula- tion started. On the 10 th another aero plane (Bulbul) arrived from Tehran with more doctors and a further quantity of vaccine. In conversation the Assistant Governor- General mentioned to His Majesty’s officiat ing Consul that the cholera was not of asevere type but was of a mild form. It may be mentioned that Dr. Dodson of the Church Missionary Society, who went to Jiafsinjan on the Gth to see a. patient suffer ing from some other disease, was not allow ed to enter the infected area. During the last week of the month news was rece ved from Rafsinjan that the epidemic had subsided but the quarantine had not been abolished by the end of the month. One of the doctors from Tehran, Dr. Mashoof, who is said to be a specialist from the Pasteur Institution in Tehran, proceeded from Rafsinjan to Bandar Abbas, to ascertain the origin of the disease as Minab was suspected to have been affected prior to the outbreak at Rafsinjan. He however found no traces of the disease in that region. A suspected case was also reported from Bam which caused some excitement for a few days. The general opinion is that there has been no cholera at all in any of the above men tioned places but only a few cases of diarrhoea or cholerine in the Rafsinjan area caused either by people taking meat from diseased animals that had been distributed free on the Id-ul-Zuha or bv their eating unripe mulberries, and that all this fuss was created in the hope of some financial benefit. It is said that the Persian Government allotted a sum of 60,000 tomans for the purpose. The number of inocculations in the Kerman town and the Rafsinjan district is ^ shown at 18,000. The European Colony including the Consulate staff was inocculat- ed by Dr. Dodson. The local Health Officer estimates the number of cases of cholera at Rafsinjan and Kamalabad at 120 and the mortality at 50%. These figures are undoubtedly ex aggerated. 61. Military Afocs—Reference para graph 34. The local newspaper “ Isti- qamat ' published an article on the 17th touching upon the work done by the Kerman Column in Lar. This Column, the editor mentions, was after its operations in Lar, ordered to disarm the districts of Gavbandi, Shipkuh, and the Gulf ports from Lingah to Dashti-Dashtistan. These ports were gateways through which fire arms and contraband goods were smuggled and distributed in Ears. After several engagements, the article adds, the Column succeeded in disarming all these places and capturing several rebel chiefs, amongst whom the following are mentioned ;— Sheikh Mazkur Khan, Chief of Gav- bandi. Sheikh Hatim Khan, Chief of Taliiri and Kangan. Sheikh Alam, Chief of Bandar Maqam. Ali Akbar Khan, Chief of Gelladari. Sheikh Abdul Rasool, Chief of Bandar Nakhl-i-Naqi. Sheikh Saifullah, of Bandar Assadi. Sheikh. Sultan, of Bandar Maqam. Sheikh Abdullah and his brother Sheikh \ usuf, Chiefs of Gavbandi ports. 62. The authorities at Bam commandeered camels during the first half of the month to take Conscript recruits to Iranshahr. One hundred and seventy recruits from Rudbar reached Bam during the third week for traning. 63 Communications. —Postal service was established between Kerman and Khabis at the beginning of the month. 64. A number of landowners in Rawar, on the Kerman-Meshed caravan route, are said to have employed labour to clear the , road between Tun and Kerman and make it passable lor motor traffic. The period to complete this work is estimated at 35 days. 65. British Interests.— Peek of the War Graves Commission, vide para graph 46, proceeded to Zahidan (Duzdab) en route to Sistan on the 2 nd. He returned to Kerman on the 11 th but owing to the sanitary restrictions, had to stay for a period of 5 days in quarantine at the British Con sulate. He left for Bandar Abbas on the 17th carrying with him the war graves removed from Sistan, Duzdab, Dehaneh Baghi and Kerman. 66 Mr. A. J. D'Cruz, 2 nd Clerk, British C onsulate, Bandar Abbas, who arrived here on the 24th April, was taken ill on arriva 1 and died on the 1 st May of blackwater fever and malaria. The deceased leaves behind in India a widow and two children. 67. Mr. Butters, Inspector, Imperial Bank of Persia, arrived in Kerman on the 25th to enquire into certain allegations against Mr. C. A. Gardner, the Kerman Manager. 68 . British Interests. — M. Belooshapkin, the Russian Trade Representative, after visiting Bandar Abbas and Bam, proceeded to Tehran during the latter part of the month. His Russian assistant remains in charge. 69. Miscellaneous. —Locusts were reported to have appeared in certain villages, of *3 Narmashir at the beginning of the month. They did some damage to the indigo crops. It is said that during the latter part of the ^uonth they laid large quantities of eggs -A the above district. Some damage to the crops was also caused by the insect called k sinn ' in the districts of Bam and Nar- naashir. G. A. RICHARDSON, His Majesty's Offg. Consul, Kerman.

British Consul's transfer. —Colonel Noel, British Consul at Kerman, was summoned to India last week and Mr. Richardson, Consul at Bandar Abbas, arrived here as Acting Consul. Appreciation. —In our opinion, anyone who renders service to a people, it is the duty of the latter to express appreciation for the services rendered, so that it might encourage others. In such matters there should be no difference between native and foreign. Colonel Noel, the afore-mentioned Con sul, was one of those who have rendered us great service. From the point of view of humanity, we consider it our duty to men tion a few of his services. The first thing is the improvement of the Zerief qanat. We all know that the water of this qanat had so much decreased two years ago that it did not go beyond the houses and gardens. Had it been left to itself, it would have certainly dried up by this time. As the result of Colonel Noel’s activities and per sonal supervision the water has increased to such an extent that it now irrigates 1,500 qasabs of cultivation. If it were worth 10,000 tomans before its value is now more than one hundred thousand. Truly, this was a service to the Kermani in general without any (self) interest. One of the greatest services which would have certainly been rendered, if this Consul had remained in Kerman, was the question of importing a cotton spinning machine. No doubt the merchants of Kerman are aw are that cotton yarn for use in Kerman carpets is one of the chief articles of import. The merchants imagined that Kerman cotton would not supply the yarn for carpets. It is said that cotton yarn for carpets should be of No. 20 count and that Kerman cotton could not be twisted into more than No. 18 count. In order to prove this he bought cotton personally and sent it to India, whence it was returned after it had been twisted into excellent No. 20 . The price of a bundle of yam is krans 60, but it was proved that, if the merchants undertook this business, the cost would come to krans 35 per bundle. In order that the Kermani should have a greater share of the profits, he (Colonel Noel) had intended to import a yarn spinn ing machine in partnership with the Persian merchants. In order to reduce the cost of this machine’s output, he had ascertained that electricity could be obtained from the water of Tigaran at Mahoon to run the machine, so that each bundle would not cost more than about 2 tomans. Apart from this, he could also supply lamps to all the houses in the city, each lamp to cost 4 shahis per night. The capital necessary for this work had been estimated at 500,000 tomans and the work would have been accomplishd by Persian merchants’ capital and partner ship. He had mentioned the project to the Shah at the time of His Imperial Majesty’s visit. He had paid a special visit to Tehran and made important representa tions to the Ministry of National Economy. We understand that Faramurzi, the repre sentative of this Ministry has taken up this matter (with a view) of the actual import ing of a machine for Kerman. In conclusion we say :— ‘ All this is from the Shah.’ Because the great Shah has turned his attention to the improvement of the econo mic the foreign officials also engage in ren dering valuable services. However on behalf of those interested in the welfare of the country, we appreciate services rendered by anyone.-s - r — ' — - -w w’ Y ^ CONFIDENTIAL. ^ Diary of His Majesty's Consul, Keiman, No. 4 for the month of June 1931- 70. Local officials .—Reference paragraph 54. Azar Begi arrived from Tehran on the 13th as Public Prosecutor* of the Appeal Court, vice Tajaddud. Mirza Abdullah Khan, Mustaufi, the eic-Chief of justice, left for Tehran on the 21 st. 71. Reference paragraph 56. Judi arrived from Tehran on the^lSth as the Investigating Judge and relieved the acting incumbent, Mirza Ali Khan, Marvazi. 72. Shariat Madar, the Amin-i-Sulh (Civil Judge) proceeded on a month’s leave on the 24th, and Mirza Ah Khan, Marvazi, was appointed to officiate in his place. In spite of his good work, vide paragraph 25, Shariat Madar has been reduced by a grade, owing to one of his judgments being re versed by the higher Court, and his visit to Tehran on leave is with the object of mak ing representations to the Ministry of justice. 73. Bihishtizadeh arrived from Tehran as the Amin-i-Sulh, Municipality Court, ,a new appointment, vide paragraph 25. 74. Reference paragraph 57. Farzanigan, the Director of Posts and Telegraphs, has received orders at Tehran to proceed to Bushire. His permanent substitute has not yet been announced. 75. Local Affairs .—Reference para graph 58. The project for bringing water into this area for Khayabans, etc., has not made any further progress. It is now mentioned that it is intended to bring water from Kuh-i-Lalehzar, a distance of 70 miles. The scheme with regard to establishment of a spinning mill at Kerman is being energetically followed up by -the Governor- General who has already recovered in cash the first instalment from the prospective share holders. Those investing less than 1,000 Tomans will be required to pay up the full value of their shares in 10 months, whereas those subscribing over this amount will be allowed 18 months for payment by instalments. About 8,000 Tumans were collected by the end of the month and paid into the National Bank of Persia, The Governor-General hopes to visit Yezd fihcrtlyjn this ronneotion and it is expect- ENCLCSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN sr ' Letter lljj2 Dated [13 AUG. 1B51 ReceU 31 AUG. 1931 ed that the traders at that place likely to take up shares will suggest that the Nation al Bank of Persia be invited to participate in this enterprise. His Excellency men tioned in course of conversition that the Soviet Trade Representative in Kerman had offered to import the spinning mill for him and that after this he had received catalogues from a German firm with whom he had had no communication on the sub ject. It is not improbable that a result of the National Bank of Persia becoming share holders will be the importation of the machinery from Germany and the employ ment of German engineers. Syed Kazim, a deputy from Yezd. is said to be on his way to meet His Excelleiicy Mirza Riza Khan and assist in his nego tiations with the Yezd merchants. In this- connection it may be mentioned that the firm of Hiratiyan in Yezd had mentioned to Colonel Noel that should the result of the sample of Rafsinjan cotton sent to India by him for spinning be found satis factory , their firm alone would be prepared to purchase shares to the extent of 100,000 Tumans. The apparently successful pro gress of the Governor-General in respect of this project cannot be attributed to any readiness on the part of the local merchants to co-operate but to His Excellency’s repeated threats of rough-handling those who were in a position to take up shares but hesitated to do so. 76. Reference paragraph 60. The quarantine against the Rafsinjan district was abolished on the 4 th. The Health Officer, Dr. Taiyibi, proceed ed to Tehran during the last week of the month obstensibly on leave, but probably to explain away the suspicions aroused by reports from Kerman that the epidemic did not actually exist. 77. Military News. —Sarhang Alburz, the Officer Commanding, Kerman Brigade, proceeded to Tehran on 20 days’ leave on the 18th. Naib Sarhang Dawar Panah is offi ciating. 78. A report from Bam states that there has been some friction between the re cruiting officer and the Deputy Governor and other members of the Conscription Committee at that place. The Recruiting Officer is opposed to making any conces sions while the rest of the members of the2 Committee are inclined to be more reason able in applying the regulations laid down. Youths liable for conscription and serving . in the Nazmieh or Amnieh at Bam, it is said, have been prosecuted for evading enlistment. 79. According to news from Bam re ceived on the 10 th, detachments from Iranshahr, Jiruft, Rudbar, Kuhistan and Bandar Abbas had proceeded to Basha- kird apparently with the object of cap turing Abdul Hussein Khan, Kameran, and disarming that district. 80. Communications. —Reference para graph 41. The Chief of the Road Department visit ed Khabis during the latter part of the month. It is expected that the work on the Kerman-Khabis road via Sirch will be started immediately and that the road will be fit for motor traffic about the end of the year. 81. It is also mentioned that the motor road from Jiruft to Bam via the Deh Bakri pass will be taken in hand at a very early date to join up with the Khabis road, the object being to connect it with Khorasan ultimately via the Lut. 82. British Interests. —The anniversary of the Birthday of H. M. the King-Emperor was celebrated on the 3rd, which was ob served as a public holiday and the Consulate flagstaff dressed in honour of the occasion. An official reception was held in the forenoon and was attended by the Governor- General, the Officer Commanding, the Chiefs of the Police and the Municipality, and by all the senior members of the Euro pean and Indian communities. In the afternoon Mrs. Richardson gave a garden party in the Consulate at which both the Governor-Genera I and his as sistant, the Officer Commanding, a few Persian officials and notables and prac tically the whole of the European com munity responded to the invitations sent them. It might be mentioned that invitations were issued to a fair number of other Per sian officials and influential residents many of whom had accepted but failed to put in an appearance on the pretext of indisposi tion. It would appear that the Governor- General had caused messages to be circu lated to many of those likely to attend to the effect that the Persian Government did not approve of their haying official relations or social intercourse with foreign ers. A few days later the Governor-General admitted in the course of conversation with a member of this Consulate that he had issued the above instructions, and ex pressed the opinion that it was in the injj^ terests of the country that the Persian should be permitted to be brought as little as possible into contact with foreigners, especially with Russians. Apropos of the instructions issued by the Persian Government in regard to inter course with foreigners, it is no secret that since about March or April last, this Con sulate is being constantly watched by two men of the Criminal Intelligence Depart ment, specially deputed for the purpose. This action, I presume, was taken on ac count of the suspicions aroused by the activities of my predecessor. His Majesty’s Officiating Consul, it might be mentioned, has received several messages from certain Persian officials and others expressing regret at being precluded from continuing their friendly relations with the Consulate. 83.

The result of Mr. Contractor’s investigation is not yet known. H. E. Reza Khan. Afshar, left for Yezd on the 6 th to secure shareholders in his spinning mill project in which His Majesty the Shah is said to be very much interested. The two deputies for Yezd and Rafsinjan, viz.. Seyid Kaz m and Nusret-ul-Mamalik respectively, met the Governor at the for mer place at the express orders of His Majesty to assist H s Exce lency in urther- ing his scheme. A sum of about Tumans 220,000 is beheved to have been subscribed at Yezd, 50,000 at Rafsinjan and 17,000 at Sirjan, which would now bring the amount up to Tumans 477,000 out of the total capital of Tumans 5 , 00,000 called for. to the town. It is believed that the local Municipality are agreeable to participate in Sheikh Abul Qassim’s venture. The Governor General mentioned about two months ago in the course of conversa tion with His Majesty’s Officiating Consul that this town would have electric lights in October but this appears doubtful as the installation has not yet commenced. 98.

The same report states that one Akbar, having collected a number of ruffians some- where near Iranshahr, attempted to create trouble, but was pursued by troops from Zabul and forced to run away. Reza Khan has since proceeded to Tehran to report progress to His Majesty and obtain further orders. In his absence, the assist ant to the Governor-General, Dadras, has been very active in promoting the scheme, holding meetings locally and visiting the districts. 97.

Intercourse between Persian officials and the British Consulate has practically ceased and the two C. I. D. mamurs detailed for the purpose are busy noting down the names of persons visiting the Consulate even on business. A former news-agent of the Consulate was recently warned by the Nazmieh against visiting the Consulate. 107. It will be remembered that Brigadier General Sir Percy Sykes on re-estalishing the Kerman Consulate in 1916 fined a number of Kermanis for having dealings with German agents. Amongst the former were the two leading Parsi traders, Suru- shian and Kayanian, who were fined heavily for buying from M. Bruggmann a quantity of yarn, etc., the property of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers Ltd. It is learnt from a confidential source that these two traders have now forwarded notices through the Adlieh Court to Sir P. Sykes and the Petag Co. trading in the North of Persia. M. Bruggmann had sold the yarn to the above traders on behalf of the Petag Co. which he then represented in Kerman. It is said that the notice on Sir P. Sykes will be served through the Persian Legation in London. The amount of damages claimed is stated to be more than ten times the actual fine paid.

Russian interests .—Reza Khan, the Soviet Trade Representative at Bandar British Consulate, Kerman ; Abbas arrived at Kerman for a short stay at the beginning of the month. Within 48 hours of his arrival he was arrested by the local authorities and despatched to Tehran under Police escort on the 12 th. It is said that he was searched at Sirjan and some propaganda papers were found on him. It would appear also that he has been wanted by the Persian police for some little time past, under the name of Mohammdoff. Recently Yawar Bahzadi, the Rais-i- Nazmieh, Bushire, visited Bandar Abbas where he recognised Reza Khan, whom he had known personally for many years. On his return to headquarters he reported Reza Khan’s whereabouts which led to his arrest. While Reza Khan was in the lock up at the Nazmieh, M Belooshapkin, the Kerman Trade Representative, sought permission to interview him, but was asked to com municate with Reza Khan in writing through the Nazmieh. It is said that among the papers found on Reza Khan, there was a list of the Amnieh posts on the Kerman-Bandar Abbas road. 110 M. Belooshapkin returned from Tehran at the beginning of the month and proceeded to Bandar Abbas, on the 12 th returning to Kerman on the 26th. It is said that he was accompanied by a Russian from Tehran who is to relieve him here shortly. 111. The Russian Oil Agent in Kerman is said to have remarked in confidence that the Russians intend closing down in the near future or curtailing their business in this province. 112.

The ori ginal project of ejecting a spinning mill in the Kerman province has now resolved itself into two distinct schemes at Yezd and Kerman respectively. The Yezdi mer chants who, in the hrst instance, had pro mised to subscribe the greater part of the capital required, viz., Krans 5,000,000, have now demanded that; the mill should be erected in their town. Out of the Krans 5 , 000,000 that have to be collected in this province, the National Bank of Persia are expectd to take up shares up to the extent of Krans 500,000 while the firm supplying the machinery, most probably German, will subscribe a similar amount, the balance to be collected in the Province. The Governor* General, whose attitude throughout the negotiations has been most arbitrary if not dictatorial, has called in l/3rd of the amount forced upon the prospective share holders, who find it difficult to comply, owing to tightness of money. 119. Reference paragraph 97. A Yezdi Company with a capital of 20,000 Tumans has come in the field as a rival to Sheikh Abul Kassim in connection with supply ing electric light to the town. Both parties have either put up insulators or fixed poles in certain sections of the town, but the Yezdi Company’s work has been stopped by the orders of the Governor-General, who seems inclined to favour Sheikh Abul Kassim. The latter has gone to Tehran to arrange matters and thence to proceed to Pehlevi where the necessary electric plant is said to have arrived. The Yezdi Company also claim that their machinery has reached Mohammerah. Further developments are awaited. 120 . The National Bank of Persia have been busy during the month fixing the credit limits of their clients. They are in clined to afford facilities and to assist local traders in their business. 121 . As an instance of the waning of the Mullah’s power in the province, the follow ing incident may be quoted: The Chief Priest, Haji Mirza Muhammed Reza, ‘ Ayatullah ’, has been summoned by the local authorities in connection with a marriage which he solemnized in which the girl was said to be underage. The incident refers to the period when the new marriage limit law had not yet been passed. The Mujtahis, who is very old, is trying to pro duce a medical certificate for inability to attend. 122 . Reference the Appendix to the Kerman Consulate Diary for May 1931. At the instigation of the Governor-General or rather under his special orders to the land- owners concerned, the management of the Zirisf Qanat which has been under this Consulate since the summer of 1929 has now been transferred to an agent of the latter. Much dissatisfaction has been caus ed thereby as the water supply to the various fields and gardens has considerably increased since the supervision anjlcontrol of repairs to the Qanat were taken in hand by us, and it is feared that the Qanat will be allowed to fall into its former defective condition.

It may be mentioned that it is in Yezd and Kerman alone that white * chadars * are in common use. The action of the Governor-General is resented as the inhabitants of Kerman are for the most part too poor to afford the purchase of black * chadars * which have gone up is price considerably since the last year. It is presumed that the above orders have been issued for the puipose of unformity of the women's dress through* cut Persia. - tNoLGtfUh I' INDIA FOREIGN Sr Letter Nc J58 Oared 5 NOV 1931 Received 23ivl't 1931 143.

Reference paragraph 45. Nothing seems to have been decided so far with regard to the purchase of the spinning mill for Rafsinjan. A new difficulty is said to have arisen as it is believed that Rafsinjan cotton will not yield 20 count yarn in a dry climate and at a high altitude, but it is not certain if this question will be minutely studied by the authorities who seem to be bent upon importing machinery for Rafsin- jan. 67. News was received in Kerman at the end of the month that the Syndicate to regu late the export trade of Persia had been formed with the aid of American capital. 'Some oLy^irq^tors of the Rafsinjan ' INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S { Letter No 9 ^ M. I Dated SOJUf 1932 Received 18JUL.j32 spinning mill Co. are of the opinion that this concern should also be entrusted to the above Syndicate. 68 Agha Mohamed Arjmand, one of the chief export weavers in Kerman, who also works for the Oriental Carpet Manufac turers, Ltd., has imported a wool carding machine from Germany. This machine is somewhat smaller than that owned by the 0. C. M., but is said to be of a more up to date type. 69. Prince Kaikaus, the Manager of the Rafsinjan branch of the National Bank of Persia has proceeded on one month’s leave, but he is not expected to return to Rafsin jan. Pir Muradi, an official of the Kerman branch has replaced Prince Kaikaus. The National Bank of Persia appear to be very short of staff particularly as two of their clerks have recently been conscripted. Re presentations by the Manager of the Bank resulted in orders emanating from Tehran that the 2 clerks should attend parade, etc., up to 10 o’clock in the mornings only. This has, however, not been possible as the Mili tary authorities do not relieve them till noon when the clerks are so tired to attend to their ordinary duties in the Bank. Military News. 70.

The fine would amount to about Tumans 4,000. Pamanmal, who is absolut ely destitute, has filed an appeal and is at present on bail. In view of the fact that Pamanmal's gold was confiscated by the Persian Government and that he has al ready been kept at Bandar Abbas for over 12 months awaiting trial, the punishment awarded seems to be rather severe. 73. Mr. J. Timoyanaki, the Kerman Manager of the 0. C. M., Ltd., a British concern and the chief carpet firm in Ker man, proceeded on four months’ leave to Europe at the end of the month, handing over the acting charge to his assistant, Mr. Aliotti.

Seyyid Ibrahim Khan, Munaqqah, arrived from Shiraz during the month on appointment as the Public Prosecutor of the Appeal Court, vice Azar Begi. Seyyid Muhsin Khan, “ Imad ”, from Ispahan replaced Judi as the Mustantiq (Prosecuting Judge). Local Affairs. 106. The news regarding the punishment meted out to a number of ‘ traitors to the country ’ for espionage in favour of ‘ fo reigners ’ was read with great alarm in the newspapers received from Tehran early in the month. 107. After a spell of very sultry weather, heavy rains of a tropical nature fell in the whole Province of Kerman on the night of the 16/17th July causing heavy floods all around. About 150 houses in the east ern quarter of the town were demolished by floods from the Sar-i-Asiab slopes (E. of the town) and a number of qanats damaged. News began to come in on the 17th of serious damage having been caused in the surrounding districts and villages. The village of Mahun, 18 miles S. E. of Kerman as the crow flies and 24 miles by the motor road, suffered very heavily. The supplies were cut oft and a number of lives were lost. As heavy rains continued off and on for several days, they caused more floods in the province, and information began to reach the local authorities of wide-spread suffering among the inhabitants of the areas affected. A heavy flood from Mahun on the 19th was averted with great effort otherwise the southern quarter of the town would have been completely under water. A great panic prevailed throughout the following week, and though the danger of further floods has for the time been averted, the oppressive weather still continued to the end of the month. The Governor-General, who deserves great commendation for his indefatigable efforts throughout the past anxious week, estimates the total damage to the province as being in the vicinity of ten Million Tomans and comprising that to 524 qanats damaged out of a total of about 3.000 in the province, 500 houses and half the season’s crops. It is believed that some 100 or 200 lives have been lost, but definite information in this respect has not as yet been received. News of the floods throughout Persia are being received, but the Gwernor-General thinks that the Kerman province has suffered most. Ac cording to His Excellency, His Majesty the Shah has contributed a sum of Tumans 5.000 for the sufferers of the Kerman pro vince, while subscriptions for their relief have been started in other provinces also. The effect cf the above floods is already noticeable as good quality wheat, which was obtainable at Rials 160 a Kharwar is prac tically unobtainable, while the more infe rior grades, in many cases from previous years’ stocks and somewhat spoiled by in sects, are at the present moment being sold at Rials 200 to 220 a Kharwar. The fact of the land-owners having incurred heavy losses, in one direction on account of their crops and in another by the damage done to their qanats, is sure to react detrimen tally on trade in general, and to increase the cost of living. The Shah is said to have telegraphed to the Governor-General order ing that the land-owners should be forced to repair their qanats even though they may have to sell their belongings to meet the required expenditure. The land- owners’ request to the Governor-General for the loan of the funds lying with the National Bank of Persia on account of the spinning mill project has been refused. The forecast in this province is gloomy as there is a scarcity of grain at the begin ning of the harvest and prices are rising steadily. The land-owners have no ready cash, on the contrary they will be unable to pay the interest due on large advances already received by them from the local Parsi traders. The carpet industry, the chief source of livelihood for the Kerman people, shows no sign of improvement. 108. Reference paragraph 94. Mr. Meyer, the Manager of the National Bank of Persia, paid a visit to Ispahan during the early part of the month. M. Haeussler, the Assistant Manager, left for Dizful on transfer on the 24th.

Reference paragraph 92. The three Directors of the Kerman Spinning Mill Company returned from Tehran in the middle of the month. The Minister of Couit turned a deaf ear to their proposals to utilize the funds for any purpose other than that for which they were collected. When the question of the inability of the Kerman share-holders to raise the remain ing necessary funds was put forward, he (the Ministers suggesting getting more subscriptions from Bandar Abbas and pro mised to help in the matter. The Parsi merchants of Yezd are offended at the treatment they received at the hands of their Muslim fellow-citizens. Among other things they complain that they were not even allowed to appoint a man of their section on the Yezd Board of Directors for the spinning mill to be erected at that place. In the circumstances they pefer to subscribe to the Kerman concern instead of the Yezd one. The Kerman Directors wanted to avail themselves of the opor- tunity oflered by this disagreement, but Arbab Kaikhusrau, the Parsi representa- tative in the Medjliss, advised the Yezd Parsis to desist from taking such a step as it would only tend to strain their rela tions with the Mohammedans still further. Communications. 110. The Chief of the Road department, accompanied by Mirza Abu Turab Khan, a land-owner of Khabis, proceeded to Teh ran on the 3rd and returned on the 28th. His visit was in connection with the motor road to Khabis, vide paragraph 77. 111. The heavy rains, referred to in para graph 107 above, caused serious damage to the roads in the province especially to the Bandar Abbas-Kerman section, near the Tang-i-Zagh. A portion of the new motor alignment to Khabis has been washed away and the road between Kerman and Yezd is in a deplorable condition. Three mails from Bandar Abbas were overdue at the end of the month, but the road autho rities were employing a large number of coolies near Tang-i-Zagh. The Governor- General was informed by the Chief of the Roads that 2,000 coolies were working on the Bandar Abbas-Kerman road, but His Ex cellency, in conversation with His Majesty’s Consul, did not deny that this was an exaggerated estimate.

Already plots to the extent of over 3,000 Tumans have been sold near the old cemetery through which the Khayaban-i-Shahpur passes and where His Excellency intends to build a large circus and put up a portrait of the Shah in the centre. The Governor-General has even recommended to Tehran that all Government depart ments, except the Military, should build new offices round this circus, on which work has already started, but has so far not received any encouraging reply. 4. Sarhang Baqir Khan of the Amnieh department arrived from Tehran at the end of the month on an inspection tour. 6. Reference paragraph 183 of 1932. Amir-i-Ibrahimi, deputy for Rafsinjan, and Dabistani, one of two two deputies for the Kerman town, arrived from Tehran on short leave during the month. 7. Reference paragraph 167 of 1932. The Governor General received a tele graphic enquiry from Tehran at the end of December asking how the matter with regard to the spinning mill project for Kerman stood. His Excellency, after consulting the share-holders, has replied suggesting that, in view of the scarcity of money and the inability of the share-holders to raise further funds, the concern should either be amalgamated with that of Yezd, or taken oyer by the Syndicate in Tehran. Failing these two alternatives he has sug gested that the one-third of the capital already deposited by the share-holders with the National Bank of Persia should be returned to them. 8. Reference paragraph 140 of 1932. —. The majority of the exiles from Mazen- deran are now at Bam. They first refused to accept estates offered to them in exchange, but now that they have acquiesced the local authorities seem to have received different orders from Tehran. The exiles are, for the present, being paid at the rate of Rials 2 per day per head. 9. Scarcity of corn, due to shortage caused by last year’s floods, has been felt in the province for the last two months, but the arrival of consignments of wheat from Khurassan and Sistan at the latter part of the month has, however, eased the situation for the time being. 10.

The Governor General returned from Bam on the 4th, and on arrival at Kerman despatched the Russian Engineer of the Roads Department to the former place to draw plans for Khayabans through the town of Bam, the construction of which His Excellency had in view. The work on the circus and other new Khayabans in the Kerman town has slack ened down to some extent for want of funds. A sum of about Tumans 18,000 is in deposit at the present moment with the National Bank of Persia on account of subscriptions received from other pro vinces and collected locally for distribution among the sufferers from the 1932 floods. The Governor General however is anxious to use this money on the construction of Khayabans on the ground that the amount is very small in comparison to the bumber of sufferers. His Excellency’s idea is to compensate the latter by the grant of plots from the Municipality lands, whether appreciated or not, and to utilize this cash for the purpose mentioned above. The channels on the two sides of the Khayaban-i-Shahpur in Kerman were watered for the first time during the month, the idea being to plant trees on both sides. Owing to wrong level and a number of under-ground houses having existed before and having now been filled with ordinary earth, a great deal of damage was caused by the flowing water. During the latter part of the month the Governor General was very busy remedying this unforeseen consequence. 17. Reference paragraph 4.

After visiting a few villages in the Province, he returned to Tehran on the 26th. 20. Mr. Hartmann of the National Bank of Persia arrived from Bandar Abbas on the 24th, accompanied by his wife and an interpreter. After inspecting the Kerman branch of the National Bank the party returned to Tehran on the 27th. Mr. Hoofer, the Bank’s Bandar Abbas Manager had accompanied the party up to Sirjan and they all had a bitter experience of driving on the Bandar Abbas-Kerman road without a mechanic. 21. Reference paragraph 7.. The Governor General was ordered from I Tehran at the latter part of the month to re-imburse to the share-holders the first instalment paid by them into the National Bank of Persia over a year ago for the ' spinning mill concern. The majority of the share-holders, particularly those who do not cultivate, or deal in, cotton, are j rejoiced over this news. The Governor- General however is endeavouring that the money already collected should be utilized for the formation of a local Company to deal in the export of Kerman products, chiefly pistachio nuts. He is experiencing great opposition and has very little hope of success. 22. Mirza Hussein Khan, Waziri, an official of the Finance Department, was put under arrest during the month on a charge of misappropriating money while holding the appointments of Financial Assistant at Bam and Baft. 23. The local Chamber of Commerce were busy during the month receiving applica tions from merchants desiring to obtain licenses to trade in sugar and going through their claims in accordance with the ins tructions issued from Tehran to regulate the sale of sugar at the Custom Houses. 24. The Military authorities held a £ jashn ’ at which fireworks were displayed, to celebrate the anniversary of the Coup d'etat, on the 22nd. Speeches were delivered by the Governor-General and the Officer Commanding the Kerman Brigade. No invitations were sent to foreign subjects this time, though one or two American carpet firms lent a number of carpets for decoration purposes.Lol 03 FD— 12 — 1 . 6 - 33 —GIPS 5 25. Two young Persians, one a school boy and the other a clerk in a carpet firm, published articles in the local newspapers during the month accusing the English Press of writing unfounded statements in connection with the A. P. 0. C. dispute. 26. Russian Interests. —Persian mer chants seem to have been warned by Tehran through the local authorities against dealing with the Russians individually. In future any purchases from the Soviet Trade Representatives have to be rtiade by a company, to be formed by traders for the purpose, and the transactions carried out with the knowledge of the Persian Govern ment.

He appeared too pessimistic and seemed convinced that all possible obstacles existed in Persia against foreign enterprise. 28.

Lincoln, His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, returned from Bandar Abbas on the 19th. 30. Local Affairs. —Amir Ibrahimi and Dabistani, two of the six deputies for the Kerman Province, who had been on leave in Kerman, received telegraphic summons to Tehran at the beginning of the month to be present at the inauguration of the 9th session of the Medjliss. 31. Reference paragraph 21. The Governor-General was successful in inducing such share-holders of the ex spinning mill concern as belonged to the Kerman district to agree to the formation of a company, with a capital of 100,000 Tumans, to import a wool carding machine with a view to promoting the cloth-weaving industry of Kerman. The ultimate object is also, if funds could be raised, to import ‘a cotton spinning mill. The Rafsinjan share-holders who were more interested in the cotton industry and the export of this commodity and their pistachio crops to foreign countries withdrew to the utmost disgust of His Excellency the^ Governor-General, who has now asked the Kerman share-holders to subscribe further money to bring the capital up to 100,000 Tumans. On the Nauruz reception His Excellency conveyed to them the Shah’s approval of the new project. 32. Reference paragraphs 3 and 16. The work on the circus and other Khaya- bans in the town has greatly slackened down owing to want of funds. The Governor-General has also received ins tructions from Tehran not to interfere any further with the cemeteries in the town. This apparently is the result of complaints by the relations of those who died and were buried within the last twelve months, and whose corpses had to be exhumed and removed by them to the new cemetery outside the town to avoid their graves being obliterated. In a few cases $ the dead bodies thus removed even showed signs of being in a fresh state. 33. The Governor-General celebrated the Anniversary of the Shah’s birthday on the 15th. Invitations w r ere, however, sent out by the Municipality Department and separate times fixed for different sections. As was done at the time of the Shah’s visit to Kerman in 1930, the Mullahs were invited first, then came the foreign representations, after which came everybody else, foreigners and Persians together. The Indian Attache' of the Consulate was invited in the absence of His Majesty’s Consul. The Consulate flagstaff was dressed on this occasion, as well as on the Nauruz day on which occasion general invitations were issued to His Majesty’s Consul and other foreigners in the station. 34. In view of the accumulation of work in the Bidayat (1st instance) Court in Kerman, orders have been received by the Adlieh Department to establish an additional court, to deal with criminal cases only. One of the reserve judges of the Appeal Court has been put in charge of the new court. 35. Two Kerman merchants, Amin- zadeh and Qazvini, left for Tehran at the latter part of the month to take part in the Economics Conference to be held at Teh ran in the first week of April. 36. Military Department .—Sarhang Mohamed Khan, Maimand, the Oflicer Commanding of the Kerman Teep, was promoted to the rank of Sartip (Brigadier General) at the end of the month. 37. Communications .—Reference para graphs 2 and 10. The Road Department in Kerman has received orders from Tehran not to disburse salaries for the month ending 20th March as the year’s budget had already been exceeded. 38. Security .—Four armed Farsi robbers, including one Siah Khan, a well-known outlaw, were captured by the Amnieh authorities near Hajiabad on the Kerman- Bandar Abbas motor road and brought in to Sirjan during the latter part of the month. One of the four, however, succeeded in escaping and Siah Khan with two others has been brought to Kerman and handed over to the military authorities. 39. Miscellaneous. —A party of 12 footballers arrived from Tehran on the 24th to compete with the Kerman team.# 2 t The latter lost and the party, whose ex penses were borne by the Kerman Munici pality, returned to the Capital on the 29th. During their stay in Kerman, different notables and merchants were asked by the Governor General to entertain the foot ballers by turn. It may be mentioned that though the house of Arbab Surushian, a wealthy Parsi land-owner, was equipped for the party’s stay, the owner Refrained from giving any entertainment to them ! 40. Misses Eardley and Birt and Messrs. Gassen and Haythornthwaite of the C. M. S. Ispahan and Miss Aidin from Yezd visited Keiman in the latter part of the month. Miss James of the Kerman Mission arrived from England of! leave at the end of the month. 41. Satisfactory rains fell during the month and the hills have for the most part of the month remained covered with snow. The prospects for the winter crops are therefore hopeful. Unusual frosts during the latter part of the month and early strong winds have however caused consider able damage to the fruit blossom. • Bandar Abbas. 42. Local Government. —Mirza Ismail Khan, Bahadur, Governor, Bandar Abbas, accompanied by Sarhang Baqir Khan, Amir-i-Nizam, and a number of other local officials, proceeded to Jask on the 9th by the Persian Gunboat “ Babr ” which came to Bandar Abbas for the purpose the previous day. This tour is said to be in connection with the misunderstanding prevailing among the representatives of the above officials at Jask which is believed to have been amicably settled. 43. The Governor held a general recep tion on behalf of the Municipality on the 15th to celebrate the Anniversary of the Shah’s birthday. 44. Dr. Kaikobad Dumree, formerly of the British Consulate-General, Meshed, and now a Persian subject, arrived from Kerman on the 15th February and has since signed a contract with the Munici pality to run their dispensary at Bandar Abbas, vide paragraph 247 of 1932, Bandar Abbas Diary. 45.

Khan Bahadur Abdul Alim, Indian Attache to His Majesty’s Consul, proceeded to India via Zahidan on the 23rd, on leave, his post having been abolished at Kerman. 57. Reference paragraph 31. The Rafsinjan share-holders of the ex spinning mill concern were finally induced to agree to their shares being transferred to the company’s account. 58. Reference paragraph 32. The construction work on the circus and new roads in the town remains at a standstill. The Kerman Municipality allotment for the year beginning with the 21st March has been reduced by Tehran from Ts. 20,000 to Ts. 8,000, in spite of the fact that a request had been made for an increase of Ts. 5,000. The Municipal authorities are now endeavouring to find their requirements locally and, among other things, steps are being taken to recover the house tax of 3 per cent, estimated on the annual rent, which was to be introduced in March 1931. A nominal rent of 10 per cent, on the value of the house has been recommended. The houses valued under Ts. 400 will be exempt from taxation. 59. Reference paragraph 16. A dam across the river passing through the town of Bam, for the construction of which large numbers of bullocks and men had been provided by the local land- owners, as the result of the Governor- General’s endeavours, was washed away by floods on the 2nd of the month, just when it was at the point of completion. About 50 per cent, of the subscriptions received from other provinces and collected locally for the relief of persons who had suffered from the floods of last July has already been utilized by the Municipality for construction work in Kerman city, Bam and Mahan. 60. Reference paragraph 8. The exiles from Mazanderan have finally taken possession of the estates handed over to them by the Finance authorities in exchange for the property left by them in the North and taken over by the Central Government. 61. Mirza Mahmud Khan, Sipasi, the 1st Mustantiq (investigating judge), of the High Tribunal for trial of Government officials, who had been in Kerman for some time enquiring into charges against certain employees of the various Government departments, returned to Tehran in the early part of the month, having previously sent four of the accused to Tehran for trial. 62. As the result of complaints sent to Tehran by the inhabitants of Sirjan against the Deputy Governor of that place, the Governor General proceeded to Sirjan, in company with the Rais-i-Nazmieh, on the 18th and returned on the 23rd, after making investigations, which resulted in His Excellency's suspension of the Deputy Governor and appointing the local Financial Agent to act in his place. The chief cause of grievance appears to have been scarcity of corn, brought about by the irregular action of the Deputy Governor in allowing the despatch of wheat to the Gulf ports, in spite of strict prohibition. Steps are now being taken by the local authorities to provide Sirjan with w^heat from Kerman and other districts in the province. While sending a report on his investigations to Tehran, the Governor General is said to have recommended the appointment of a more efficient Deputy Governor. 63. At a meeting held by the Parsi com munity of Kerman in the beginning of the month, on the occasion of Sir Dinshah Petit’s death, it w^as decided to raise a fund, with the object of adding two classes to the Parsi National School, in memory of the deceased. So far some 15,000 Rials have been subscribed. 64. Ccmmunications. —The Kerman- Bandar Abbas motor road was closed to traffic from the 1st to 12th of the month, the Tang-i-Zagh section of the road having been badly damaged by heavy rains and many travellers w^ere held up or had to return to either Kerman or Bandar Abbas. 65. Security. — The Governor General received telegraphic news from Sirjan on the 27th that a band of 16 Farsi robbers had been seen near Sa’adatabad, about 20 miles distant from Sa’idabad, on the Sirjan- Kerman road, and had looted some villages in the neighbourhood. This coupled with the report of recent robbery between Sirjan nand Bandar Abbas (vide paragraph 74 below) caused the local authorities some alarm and the Governor-denera! was afraid that this might be the result of the acti vities of the two military columns, des patched from Kerman and Ears to disband tribes who were now moving up to their summer quarters. As it transpired later, however, the matter seems to have been greatly exaggerated, as only a few sheep and some other unimportant property had been carried away by a small band of poorly-armed outlaws from the districts of Shahr-i-Babek and Pariz, one of whom was captured and brought in to Kerman on the 29th. Bandar Abbas. 66. Local Government. —Naib II Mohamed Khan, Zand, from Kerman, relieved Muin- Naib Sardari as Officer Commanding, Amnieh Bandar Abbas, on the 2nd..

The work on the water wells has been closed down for the approach of summer. The construction which is said to have cost over Rials 80,000 was totally demo lished by floods on the 2nd. 70. At the request of the inhabitants of Khamir, Aghai Samavi, the Mustantiq (investigating judge), was sent to the place on the 3rd to investigate into the murder of a passenger who is reported to have arrived by a sailing dhow from the Trucial Coast with some contraband goods and landed at Mahtabi. The man who was found drowned in a water tank is said to have approached the Khan of Dizgan (who afterwards reported the matter to the Mucir of Khamir) for transport for which he has amply paid. Only ten half-empty bags of sugar were brought to Bandar Abbas Customs. The Mustantiq returned on the 22nd after completing his enquiries. Sayyed Mohamed Salihi, the Mudir of Khamir, who is said to be implicated in the above murder case, was relieved by another clerk, Mirza Ali Agha Shuja’i, on the 13tlw and arrived at Bandar Abbas on the 25th. 71. Mirza Crhulam Ali Khan, Suroush, Finance Inspector for the Gulf Ports, arrived from Bushire on the 27th. 72. The construction work on the go- downs and the extension of the Customs pier has been partly completed, and the contractor returned to Isfahan, with his mason, on the 26th for the summer. The project includes the erection of a shade on the pier. 73. Condition of the country. —A fairly heavy shower of rain fell in the town and district on the 1st and 2nd, causing con siderable damage to buildings and agricul tural property amounting to Rials 500,000. 74. Condition of Roads. —The postal service and motor traffic on the Bandar Abbas-Kerman road were totally suspended, owing to heavy rains on the 1st and 2nd, between the 2nd and 12th.

Sharaskin, the Soviet piece-goods specialist, arrived from Tehran, via Kerman, on the 5th and proceeded to Bushire on the 27th. Having been obliged to abandon his car at Gohra and travel by donkey, on account of bad road, he was attacked by a small band of robbers near Sarzeh, about 30 miles out of Bandar Abbas, and stripped of all his belongings, after being roughly handled by the robbers who are said to belong to the neighbouring country.I 77.

Diary of His Majesty’s Consulate, Kerman, No. 8, for the month of August 1933. 18!?. Local Officials. —H. E. Mirza Sayyed Mustafa Kha i Kazimi, Governor- General, Kerman, left tor Tehran on the 21st oi tne month, ostensibly on short leave. Within a few days after his departure, however, the appointment of Mirza Abul Hassan Khan Peernia (Mu’azid-us-Saltaneh) to the post vas announced in the Tehran papers, though no official intimation had yet been received by Padrass, the Assistant Gov ernor-General, who was placed in charge of the Governorate-General, at the end of the month. Due to his lather impulsive and inde pendent nature, Kazimi had fallen out with practically all the heads of the local departments at one time or other duii ig his term ot office in Kerman. He was however very popular with the general public who are greatly concerned at his s-udden recall. He took an exceptional interest in the work oi construction of new roads and ave mes and, had he been allowed to remain here another year or two, the city of Kerman would have undergone unprecedented improvements. As it is, after spending a sum of about Rials 500,000, he has left behind him a large number of demolished houses and several unfinished roads. How tar the new Governor-General will be able or willing to complete the work begun by his predecessor remains to be seen. It will be remembered that Peernia was Govern or-General, Kerman from August 1929 to June 1930. 1£5. Mirza Hassan Khan Jaudat, who held the post of Director ot Education in Kerman since December 1927, was te- called to, and left for, Tehran on the 21st. H6. Reference paragraph 153. Naib Sarhang Farajullah Khan Mushar, officer in charge ot the Con scription Department, returned from leave in the beginning ot the month. 187. Local Affairs .—The conductors of a theatrical show, given at the Pehlevi Government School in the 2nd week of the month, weie taken to tadt by the local judicial authorities because one ot the actors was alleged to have used ex pressions defamatory to the present Minister ot Justice by addressing another actor (who played the part ot a judge) as ‘ Davar ’, and calling him an execu tioner immediately afterwards. The Police authorities intended to arrest the responsible parties on the spot, but the Governor-(ieneral, who was one of the spectators, intervened on the ground that the matter was not worth making a fuss about. The judicial authorities seem to have reported the incident to I'ehran and to have received orders to take up the case. Consequent ly all the parties concerned, including the Chief oi Education, were summoned and detained tor periods varying from 6 to 48 hours, while investigations were being made. The Governor-General, who is suppos ed to have gone over the play with the Chief of Education before sanctioning the perfoimance, is said to have overlooked the significance of the objectionable words. His Excellency’s sudden recall to Tenran is considered by some to be connected with this incident. There is no doubt that the Chief of Education has been recalled mainly on this account. 188. Refeience paragraph 151. The Board ot Directors have received intimation from Tehran that negotia tions are going ahead for the purchase of a wool carding machine, of 30 h. p.,from German firms. It will be remembered that there are already two wool carding plants in Kerman, one, a British-made 20 h. p. machine, belonging to Messrs. The Oriental Carpet Manufacturers, Ltd. a British concern, and the other, a 10 h. p. machine, imported from Germany last year by one of the principal carpet weavers of Kerman. 183. Out of Rials 1,000,000, the capital fixed for the new company in Kerman, only Rails 600,000, have been collected up to date. 190. Reference paragraph 152. Mirza Sayyed Ja’far Khan Nabavi returned from Baft in the early part of the month and visited Bam at the end of the month. Several lorry loads of property left by the I. E. T.

Reference paragraph 161. Mirza Riza Khan Ameri, an inspector from the Central Monopoly Department, ariived nom Tehran in the latter part of the month, to enquire into the cases of misappropriation discovered in the Kerman Monopoly Department. The person in charge of the Monopoly go- downs has consequently been put under arrest in connection with a shortage in the stocks of opium amounting to nearly Rials 40,000. 193. As the result of complaints made by the town bakers against the land- owners for demanding arbitrary prices for wheat, a meeti ig was held at the Government House on the 3rd of the month, when the principal land-owners were asked by the Governor-General to co-operate with him in keeping the price of bread to a reasonably low level. There has been a marked decrease this year in the amount of harvest for wheat \ in the vicinity of Kerman town, due to several qanats having been damaged by the floods in July 1932. It is however hoped that the crops in the outlying districts, which are said to be com paratively good, will make up for this shortage to some extent. 194. Reference paiagraph 85.

As the land owners had, for this reason, asked for remission in the amount of revenues due by them, the Director left lor Gohra for local inspection on the Crd and returned on the 5th. He has now promised the land-owners that he will represent their case to higher authorities with a recommendation from himself. 207.

According to the same information, the matter was reported to one ol His Majesty’s sloops, who arrived on the spot a day or two later, and consequently 300 blue Jackets have been landed there with two guns and two British gunboats have been stationed in tne harbour to guard the place for the present. The general coffee shop opinion stated is that if the Persian Government wished to claim Basidu as Persian territory the action of hauling down the ! flag was both improper and impolite. 208. H. M.

Diary of His Majesty’s Consulate, Kerman, No. 9, for the mcnthof September ^ 1933. 213. Local Officials .—His Excellency Mirza Abul Hassan Khan Peernia, the new Governor-General, anived in Kerman on the 7th, when he was met a tew miles outside the city by most of the neads of the local government departments a id a large number of notables and leading mercnants. Touching upon his previous visit to Kerman and the proposals he had made to the Central Government in connection with the construction of new roads in the province ; His Excellency laid great stress on the interest which H. I.M. the Shah took in the advancement of the country in general and trade and industry in particular. A s regards roads, His Excellency said, while taking leave from the Shah, he had again submitted the proposal for making a motor road from Keiman to Meshed, via Rawar, and had received orders to go on with the project, the total cost of which, estimat ed at about Rials 100,000, H. I. M. had offered to pay trom his own pocket. The Shah had made special reference to the question of cotton yarn, of which there was a great demand in this pro vince, and regretted the tact that, in spite of Kerman being one ot the chief cotton glowing centres in Persia, cotton yarn was still being imported into the province from abroad. Another matter broached by H. I. M. baa been that ot raw wool. ~ The wool produced in this part of the country, the Shah had remarked, had a good reputa tion, but the matter of sheep breeding had been very much neglected, and steps should be taken to preserve the good breeds and improve them, if necessary, by the introduction of new animals from elsewhere. 214.

Local Affairs .—One of the im provements effected by Kazimi, the ex- Governor-General, a short time before his recall to Tehran, was the closing up of bathing tanks in the public baths and fixing taps thereto. This has caused some agitation amongst certain sections of the orthodox inhabitants, who have been making complaints to the new Gov ernor-General, on the ground that religi ous ablutions could not be performed under the present arrangement. They further argue tnat in no other town has the complete closure of these tanks been attempted and that everywhere people have access to both systems. Their re presentations have so far produced no result as the new Governor-General is loath to reverse the actions of his pre decessor. 220. Reference concluding portion of paragraph 184. The construction work on the circus and new roads in the town, which was suspended on the &lt;?#-Governor-General’s departure, has not been resumed, and there are no signs of any intention on the part ot the new Governor-General to continue the work, for want of funds. 221.

Iliff from Shiraz, during the month, for school work in Kerman, without which the above im provements were impossible, has acted as a great impetus to the C. M. S. e^rca- tional work in this place. ^ The C. M. S. Girls School, on the other hand, has received a set-back by the departure of Miss J. F. Woodroffe, the Head Mistress, who left for England in the beginning of the month in order to complete her B.A. course, without which, according to the new regulations of the Persian Ministry of Education, she could not run her school. Miss J. G. Moore, Evangelist, has, in the meantime, been placed in charge of the Girls School, pending the arrival of a permanent relief. 231. Russian Interests .—Sheikh Abul Qasim Harandi, the Russian sales agent in Kerman, who proceeded to Tehran in June last, is said to have got into trouble with the Police in connection with his relations with the Soviet authorities. Although the circumstances of the case are not yet known here, it is certain that Harandi has been under detention in Tehran for several da\s.

Considering the already impoverished condition of the Kerman Municipality ~ funds,, it is feared that the Health arrange ments in this province will suffer badly, unless the decision is reconsidered by the Central Government. 282. The Orphanage and a charitable hospital in Kerman have been placed under the direct management of the Education Department, as the result of complaints received, and enquiries made, by the Com mission of Enquiry, in connection with these two institutions, at the end of the month. 283. - As the result of representations made to Tehran by a number of.

The Governor-General has been studying the question of extracting juice from the liquorice plant, of which there is said to be an unlimited quantity in this province, and hopes to be aide* to raise funds for the purchase and importation of a proper machine for this purpose, 287. Apropos of the approach of winter and the scarcity of charcoal, which is steadily getting worse every year, the I rovincial Director ot Finance in Kerman had applied to his Ministry in connection with the grant of an allotment for the working of a coal mine situated in the Badamu hills, some 20 miles to the west of Kerman.

The Malieh offices in Kerman are now said to be burning coal in all their stoves. It is expected that, before long, this coal will be offered to the public at the rate of about Rials 30 per 100 Mans, or just about half the present price of w'ood charcoal. r lhis mine was visited by a British Geological expert in 1913. 288.

Mo l* 5 * Utiar 1 1 jcjAMIttU2 in view of the fact that the 1 Sitara-ye- Jehan ’ has few subscribers in this town, representations, supported by the local authorities, have been made to Tehran, re commending the re-consideration of this decision. 289. A new problem has presented itself in connection with the registration of property by the fact that a large propor tion of shops in this province hold what is locally called the right of ‘ sar-qufii ’, origi nating in the privilege enjoyed by the origi nal occupant to transfer his ‘ right of priority ’ to other parties. The money which has in this manner changed hands from time to time amounts, in many cases, to three or four times the actual value of the property concerned, and such properties are therefore left with two owners, each of whom draws a separate rent. As there are so far no provisions in the laws of the country to deal with this extra ownership, the Registration authorities re fuse to recognize the right of the ‘ sar- qufli ’ owners and, consequently, the parties concerned have decided to make representa tions to Tehran on the subject. 290. The Governor-General has been collecting subscriptions for poor relief, with a view to gathering a number of beggars in Kerman and providing them with food and bedding during the winter months. 291. Sartip Farajullah Khan, Director- General of the Census Department in Persia, arrived here on the 29th on a visit of inspection and intends, it is said, pro ceeding to Iranshahr, to establish a Cen sus Department for the Persian Balu chistan. 292.

About 50 per cent, of the capital has already been promised by the Swedish concern of Persiska Kompaniet Aktienbolag of Tehran, who, it appears, have been pre viously studying the possibilities of trade in the liquorice root or extract in this part of the country, and the remaining 50 per cent, will be provided by local merchants or land- owners. The idea is to import machinery for the extraction of the juice and the drying of the same into extract. The liquorice plant growing in the above- mentioned district is believed to be of the best kind available in the country. Accord ing to experiments made locally, about 9 lbs. of the root would yield one lb. of dry extract which, in its turn, contains an average of 18 per cent, of glycyrrhizin. Samples of the dried extract, made locally, are said to have been sent to Europe in the past, and offers made amounted to as much as £60 (£ sixty) or even more for each ton. The root obtainable in the area con cerned, if calculations made by the Swedish expert at the time could be relied upon, would suffice for the preparation of the dried extract by machinery for over 40 years, at the rate of 1| tons per day ! 317.

British Interests. 320. Translation of the article by the correspondent of the “Daily Telegraph^, which had appeared in the latter paper on the 28th November last, in connection with the writer s recent visit to Persia and his interview with the Shah, w r as copied from the Tehran press by three of the local papers during the month. 321 Three Persian converts—two assis' tents in the C. M. S. hospital and a Persian evangelist in the employment of the L. M. t&gt;., who had taken a leading part in a Persian service, held in the C. M. S. Church on the 10th of the month, were summoned, on the following day, to the Ta’minat branch of the local Police Department and, after some cross-examination by a secret detective, who had been present at the service, made to sign undertakings not to preach Chris tianity or speak against Islam any more, failing which they were told that they would be kept under detention and, in the case of the evangelist, that he would be charged with espionage ! As a matter of fact the latter refused to undertake anything further than that he would not preach against Islam, but he was told by the Police autho rities that this would be sufficient for their purpose, as preaching in any other religion was tantamount to speaking against Islam. In the meantime, the evangelist’s house was searched by detectives, without any thing of a serious character being found. One or two letters which the evangelist has written to a British Missionary in Kerman from the districts, had already been inter cepted by the Police, as the result of which the writer had been placed under secret observation. The same detective, accompanied by two policemen, presented himself at the door of the Mission Church on Christmas Day, while a Persian Holy Communion was being observed, and demanded entry. As the presence of un-confirmed persons at Holy Communion is considered by the Church authorities to be contrary to the rules, Revd. H. E. J. Biggs, the Parson, refused to let him in. After some altercation and an attempt by the detective to prevent some of tlr^ 1 Persian converts from attending the Com munion service, the detective was persuaded to visit Dr. Dodson, the senior Medical Missionary, who apparently managed to appease him, and so he contented himself with being present at the general Persian service which was held in the Church shortly afterwards. The above incidents have caused some alarm to the British Missionaries in Ker man, who are of opinion that serious inter ference on the part of the local authorities with their evangelical work would make their further residence in the country im possible. The local Police, on the other hand, are said to have argued that any gathering to which a detective could not gain admit tance was illegal, according to their stall ing orders, and would have to be stopped. Later on, Dr. Dodson called upon the Chief of the Police and obtained a verbal promise that there would be no further repi- tition of such interference. How far this promise will be kept remains to be seen. Miscellaneous. 322.

Private enquiries however elucidated the fact that the interference by the Police was nothing more, or less, than an attempt to induce the parties concerned to part with a fraction of their hire, and as the com plainants eventually proceeded to Yezd without calling at the Con sulate again, it is presumed that the matter ended by an 'amicable' settlement.

Of tto 149 o.„41d»t.» „ h . th....!^ onlyonly 67 were declared successful in having passed the written part (writing, arithmetic, essay and dictation). The final figures were only arrived at after the arithmetic papers had 'been re-scrutinised and extra marks given, owing to complaints made by masters and boys because of the difficulty of the questions , some of which were far too hard for the boys of the primary standard, and would have taxed the powers of many boys in the Middle school. The piece selected for dictation also was too hard, containing from 50 to 60 difficult words, and these were arranged so close together as to make it dif ficult for the boys to understand the gist. To an outsider it ap peared that the Examination Board entirely failed to realise that the examination was a primary one, and they also seemed to think that the candidates had the same amount of knowledge as themselves. The feeling in the town is very strong on the subject and it is said that the primary schools, other than government ones, are intending lodging an official complaint against the conduct of the examination ./hether this will have any effect remains to be seen, but if the complaint is not made another year will probably see a repetition of the farce, as this year was a repetition of what took place in 1932. The C.M.S. school authorities intend to put in a complaint to the Ministry of Education on the subject. BRITISH INTERESTS . lo7. The annual Drill Competition of the C.M.S.

He advised them to form companies for dealing in sugar, to huy in wholesale from Government, and sell to retail dealers, with a fair margin of profit for the company. He also advised them to co-operate with the Government Officials in suppressing smuggling, and expose the illegi timate dealers. He accordingly issued orders to the local Customs to take over all stocks from merchants and return in kind at the reduced rate, with the new bande role, which is for use within sixteen farsangs from Persian Coast. A company with a capital of Rials 100,000/ is reported to he formed to purchase sugar and loaf sugar for -orovinoi ?1 use st t»lie following ratios* Crystal sugar at 3.ials 7 s 33 tman Leaf sugar at Rials S £ -atnian* and sell them at a profit of Cents 40 a Batman to the retail dealers, and the latter could increase the prices hy Cents 75, i.e. the price of crystal sugar and loaf sugar are to he Rials 8-15 and 9-15 a Batman respectively.

As the result of complaints received from certain British subjects at Charbar, against the high-handed actions of the local authorities in forcing them to adopt Persian nationality, Major C.H. Lincoln, O.B.E., His Majesty’s Consul, Al©r m an, received orders from His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, at the latter part of November last to proceed to Charbar# Major Lincoln left Kerman on the 24th November and arrived at Charbar on the night of the 30th idem. He again left Charbar on the 19th March and arrived in Kerman on the 26th idem, after spend ing a few days at Bandar Abbas. The result of this visit to Charbar and the dealings with the local authorities at the latter place in connection with this question form the subject of separate despatches to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. LOCAL AFFAIRS . 29. News having been received from Tehran about the abolition of land revenue, in the beginning of January, a meeting was held in the Jum’a Musjid on the 4th to celebrate the event. After lengthy speeches by editors of the local papers proposals for rendering thanks to H.I.M. the Shah was carried with unanimous acclamations and telegrams were despatched to Tehran accordingly. The new tax of 3 per cent on practically all articles of food stuff etc. entering cities and towns is expected to be far in excess of the abolished land revenue which it will replace. 3CU His Excellency Mirza Ali Akbar Khan Davar, Minister of Finance, arrived from Bandar Abbas on the 13th February and left for Tehran via Yezd on the 19th idem, without meeting the Governor-General, who did not leave his house during the Minister^ visit on the ground of ill-health. The chief events connected with the Minister’s visit are noted briefly below:-a) Interview with the local merchants, when the Minister recom mended the formation of new companies and the improvement of agri culture by the introduction of modern methods. b) Formation of a company for the promotion of the carpet trade, with a capital of Rials 1,000,000, 30 per cent to be contributed X *4&gt;y local merchants and chief manufacturers and 70 per cent by the Agricultural Bank, after a branch of the latter Bank opens in Kerman. c) Recommendation for the increase of carpet weavers’ wages by about 40 per cent, which has since been found to be impracticable in view of the slump in the carpet trade. d) Raising the price of prepared opium from Rials 1-25 to Rials 1-50. This decision was taken by the Minister as a meastre to check local consumption, it having been represented to him that the number of addicts in this province, which was already higher than any other place in Persia, was on the increase. It is, however, feared that even this small increase in price will once again tend to encourage smuggling from other provinces. e) Sanctioning the advance of Rials 30,000 to ensure a permanent supply of water for a portion of the new avenues in the town. f) Encouraging a project for the construction of a motor road from Kerman to Bandar Abbas via Jiruft and Rudbar. g) Recommending the retirement of Amir Khan Suhrabian, the pro vincial director of Finance, Kerman, who has since been relieved by Asadullah Khan Mujarrad, Acting Provincial Director. h) Suspension of Sanjari and Benan, two of the senior officials in the Kerman Finance Office. 31. The Birthday of H.I.M. the Shah was celebrated in the usual manner in Kerman. a reception was held at the Government House on the night of the 14th March, with a display of fire-works, on behalf of the Kerman Municipality, and the public buildings and bazaars were illuminated the following night, when a .joy caravan' procession was conducted by the military authorities as in the pre- vious year. 32. Elections for the 10th Session of the Medjliss were con- ductedducted throughout the province during February and five of the six former deputies re-elected, Muayyed Ahmadi, one of the two members for Kerman city, having been replaced by Hassan Agha Kazvini, a leading merchant of Kerman. 33. Mirza Ali Asghar Khan Hekmat, Minister of Education, arrived from Tehran on the 26th March, and was met by a large party of local officials, school masters, editors and notables at Baghin, some 20 miles out of Kerman. He left for Yezd, en route to Shiraz, on the 31st, after inspecting the local schools and paying a visit to Bam. The Minister was particularly affable to Messrs Snow and Iliff, Principal and Head Master of the C.M.S. Boys» School, when they were introduced to him at Baghin and expressed a wish to see their school, which he did on the 28th March and was apparently very pleased with what he saw. While going round the school he instructed his Secretary to make notes of certain specialities, such as weekly cinema, inter-house competitions, wall pictures * etc., with a view to adopting them in Government schools# Re greatly admired the big Hall and the Governor-General, who was present, told him that the C.M.S. Boys’ school was practically the only one in the town worthy of the name and that everything was worthy of the highest praise - rather to the dismay of the local Director of Education, when he saw the school office and book-shop he said that in future he would keep the school sup plied with all new books issued by the Ministry. He then saw a short gymnastic display on the vaulting horse and a show by the Scouts, with both of which he was very much impres sed. During his visit the Minister repeatedly asked how he could help the school, adding that the Ministry were grateful for all the edj.c.:ationa 1 work done by the C.M.S. school authorities and were out to help them as much as possible. Mr Snow, the Principal, explained that his chief need was first class staff for the top classes, and the Minister promised that next year he would send two men from Tehran who would divide their time between the Government and the C.M.S. schools, at no cost to the latter:this will he a great help# He made no reference to the religions side of the work, hut the Principal told him that he used the Hall for opening prayers every morning. Another matter of importance which the Minister mentioned was that he hoped to give hack the primary schools to the Mission; he said he would have to act slowly and carefully owing to tfce V 5 J Russians in the north and to do it in such a way that they could not take offence and demand the same privilege, hut it was his aim to let the Mission have them again* His attitude the whole time was extremely friendly and there is no douht that he was very pleased with his visit. He also visited the C.M.S. Grirls* school, which has been doing well under Miss J. F. Woodroffe, in spite of the fact that they have had to close down their primary classes, in response to recent regulations, and was equally impressed with the arrange ment s* 34. Arrangements were made hy the Governor-General in the early part of Hecemher to collect the town beggars in a house for the winter months and provide them with free hoard and lodging. Apart from the subscriptions collected hy His Excellency, an allot ment of Rials 6,000 has been provided for this purpose in the Muni cipality budget. 35. The Opium Monopoly Department was taken over hy the local Finance office early in January, and the majority of the staff were discharged* 36. The Balance Sheet of the Sherkat-i-Sihami-i-Kerman, which was published at the end of March, shows a profit of 12 per cent for the share-holders. The shares of this company, how ever, are still being offered for sale in the local market at considerable discount. In one case a number of shares were recently bought by the manager of the company at 50 per cent of the original value! 37.

The military detachments sent against Baluch raiders at the end of October and beginning of November succeeded in chasing the outlaws away from the neighbourhood of Shahdad, and continued their operations towards Khwash, where the majority of the forces despatched from Kerman are said to be stationed at the present time. Some 25 Baluoh prisoners, with a small number of arms and ammuni tion, were brought to Kerman during January and February, and are awaiting trial for armed brigandage. In the meantime, diplomatic negotiations with Baluoh chiefs and the release of Sardar Hussein Khan (son of late Sardar S&amp;^d Khan) at w0 at Iranshahr in February have brought about a more coneiliatory 0 ^ atmosphere in Persian Baluchistan, in spite of the fact that oases of raid by solitary outlaws are still being brought to notice from time to time, and news of a raid by the followers of Abdul Hussein Kamran in the district of Jiruft were received at Kerman at the end of March* 'V 44♦ The anniversary of the coup d’etat was celebrated in Kerman, with the usual military display on the parade ground, on the 22nd February. 45* All students of the middle schools in Kerman were called upon to register their names at the school for the training of the H.C.O’s on the 24th December, since when they have been attending parades on certain days of the week, in order to be able to Join military reviews on the anniversaries of the coup d’etat. 46# Naib Sarhang Farajullah Khan Mushar, Officer Commanding Conscription, who had proceeded on leave to Tehran in August last, returned to Kerman in the middle of March. 47.

Reforanoe paragraph 6. Mirza Mustafa .3ian Kulibud, who was in the anployment of the late Haji Moin of 3 i ushire, while the latter held the concession for the mines, and who suooeedei, after Moin r a death and the sub sequent seizure of the mines by the Persian Government, in getting himself appointed as Government broker for the red oxide, arrived from Tehran on the 3th, to supervise the first consignment of three thousand tons, which was being shipped by the Persian Govern msnt to the United Kingdom by s.s. Tabaris tan between the 10th and 17th. It is said that, during his stay, he despatched samples of the red oxide to thirteen different countries, in the hope of at tracting customers.

Mr Boman Irani, who has business in Hong Kong and China and had lately obtained from the Persian Government the sole monopoly rights of the red oxide for the Indian markets, undertaking to purchase^ not less than 2500 tons a year, arrived here on the 3th and was surprised to learn that the Government had, without his knowledge, sold a consignment of 500 tons at more favourable rates to Messrs Haji Ali Akbar &amp; Sons of Manches ter, for the same market. He considers this detrimental to his i.iterrsto and contrary to the stipulations of the agreement, especially An viev/ of his having shouldered a great responsibility to dispose of 2500 tons per annum. (The records of the past 20 years show that the yearly output lias never exceeded an average of 750 tons.)

The Oovtrnor-Oeneral proceeded to Jiruft on the 17th and returned on the 26th, with the object, it is said, of studying the project of making a motor road to Jiruft* The opinion formed by His Excellency in respect of the feasibili ty of this road is understood to be somewhat unfavourable, but he has submitted a report to Tehran, giving details of the various sections* At Sabzawaran, the present headquarters of the Deputy- Governor, the Governor-General received a pleasant surprise by meeting a number of villagers in sports uniform, who were intro duced to him as members of the recently-organised yiruft Football elub* 81. The Jhiharram processions were curtailed this year to an unprecedented extent, the various leaders in each quarter of the town having been warned previously by the local authorities that the processions should not move outside specified areas allot ted to them and that within a limited space of time. The stripping of bodies was prohibited and the up-to-now minor details, such as horses and torches, were precluded. Two notable Roza-Khwans from Yezd (Haji Sheikh Ahmad, Rukn-ul-Islam and Sayycd Muhammad Zarchi of Yezd) were brought to Kerman, under escort, in the early part of the month, for making utterances showing their resentment at the new orders. As the result of intercession by the local authorities, however, they were both allowed to practise their profession in Kerman, under certain conditions. 82. Reference paragraph 32. As the result of telegraphic representations made to H.I.IV!, the Shah, by Haji Mlrza Mohammad Reza, the Chief Mujtahid of Kerman, the latter’s cousin, Muayyed Ahmadi, former deputy forKerman oity, who was superseded hy Hassan Agha Kazvini in the last elections, is said to have been elected M # P. for the district of Char Mahall in Isfahan. 83. Four of the six deputies for Kerman returned from Tehran during the month, on short leave, it having been decided to keep the ifajliss closed for another month or so. The news regarding the compulsory departure of Dadgar, Chairman ot tue Jtejliss, to Ufurope has given rise to a number of rumours, including the intended closure of the Parliament for an indefinite period. 84. a meeting was held at the Government House, under the presi dency of the Governor-General, on the 23rd, in connection with the oinstruction of a hall and two sports grounds in Kerman for physics! training, the cost of which has been estimated between Rials 50,000 (£.833) and 100,000 (£.1666), and a sum of Rials 15,000 (£.250) was subscribed for the purpose by those present. 85. Haji -einul-Abedin Khan Ibrahimi, •Sarkar Agha 1 (the spirit ual leader of the Sheikhi sect and chief of the Ibrahim - or K ha wan in - family in Kerman), returned from his pilgrimage to the Holy Shrines in Iraq on the 27th. It appears that, while in Kerbela, Haji Zeinul-Abedin and his followers were subjected to various insults and interferences on behalf of the local orthodox Sfai'a Mullahs, one of whom published a pamphlet, declaring the Sheikhis as a heretical eect. t ills audience with the Shah at Tehran, when he was returning to Kerman, ’Sarkar Agh?&lt; f is said to have been reprimanded by H.I.M for complaining to the local authorities in Iraq against the ill- treatment received by him, without first applying to the Persian diplomatic representative. 86. The following obituary news was not included in the last Diary through an oversight:- Mirza Hussein Khan Isfandiari (Sardar Husrat) the leading and most influential notable in Kerman until the commencement of the present regime, died on the 13th November last. The d « oe ased held the post of Acting Governor-General Kermmnon various occasions and was ComnanAar of the local Army, until the abolition of the old ’Sarhaa* force in 19££. He rendered fcreat services to the British during the Great War, sometimes at (W Jfehe risk of his Idf# , ehieh was attenpted upon b/ the Gericans In 1915, for which he was awarded the C.B.3, in 1921. Tith the advent of the new re^iaie, the deceased lost his prestige and influence and was confined to his bed, suffering from paralysis for over three years before his death. Sardar Husrat has left two cons, the elder, ??irsa Kascan Khan !/ir 1 at Tsfandlarl (Kir'at-us-Saltana), is now deputy for the Slrjan constituency, and the younger, ttiraa Abdullah than »Adl Isfandiari ('Adl-us-Saltana), holde the post of *Chief of Cabinet* in the Central Department of Agriculture in Tehran. 87. Herr Albert Haeusaler, who had been Manager of the Kerman branch cf the Persian National Bank since last June, was relieved by Arsin Barkhurdarian, a Persian Armenian, during the month, his contract with the Persian Government having expired, and proceeded to Bush ire, via Sir Jan and Shiraa, en route to Europe, on the 1st May. 98. ?he carpet business in Kerman, which had been steadily getting worse for the last several months, received a severe blow by the sudden fall in the rate of exchange during the month. Orders have had to be cancelled all round and many weavers have closed down. The position has been aggravated by the visit to Kerman, at the latter part of the month, of Hr. A.C. Kdwards, General ii'anager in London, of 1 essrs The Oriental Carpet Manufacturers Limited, with the object of making preliminary arrangements for the winding up of the firm’s business in Kerman. ■ rst deputation of the Kerman un-»employed, who waited upon the Govemor-General at the end of the month, were told that their representations would be oommunloated to Tehran. 89.

The Sherkat, who have already imported a ^carding plant, have undertaken to Import further machinery for carding and spinning purposes and leave these at M. ^'etli's disposal under certain conditions. 90. Reference paragraph 30 (d). The sole of taxe^ opium having decreased considerably t as the result of the raising of prloes to Rials 1.50 (six pence), per misKal one-sixth of an ounoe), instructions were received by the local Finance authorities from Tehran, in the early part of toe month, cancelling the previous orders and fixing the prioes onoe more at Rials 1.25 (five pence) per raiskal. 91. Mlrsa Muhslm Khan Qarib end four other officials from the ■fin la try of Finance arrived from Tehran on toe 22nd, having been deputed to purchase all the crude opitun from toe lend-owners N»an (about 106 r ounces), provided that only 25 per cent of the weight is lost in the process of preparation. If the weight of prepared opium differs from this standard, the prioee will be ' ^ Proportion. At this rate each miakal of prepared opium would cost the Monopoly authorities Just about half a rial (two penoe) and their gains on the opium sold to shop-keepers for local consumption would amount to approximately three quarters of a rial (3 penoe) per miskal. Considering the high risks which will have to b* run, this margin, it is hoped, would not be lucrative enoirh The opium crop this year is said to be exceptionally good and if the new arrangement proves to be sucoe.eful and the greater part of the harvest is sold to the Government, it would probably amount to something like 15,000 Mane (about ten times the amount delivered to the monopoly frodowns in 1934), the gains on which for the Govern ment working out approximately at Rials 7,500,0001 (about f. 125000 For this one year, it is said, thw owners will not be interfered for this year. »&gt;he rate fixed is Riels 250 (£.4.3.4) per Tabri* at the present rate of exchange).Interfered with in any way, but if it ehould be prored Xin^ still oontinues t then the authorltles 9 apart frow finif ^ offenders heavily, will have recourse to other methods# The new prices are the highest paid by the Oovernraent for many past, tMr reason being to encourage the owners to hand over all their opium and remove, as far as possible,the temptation to smuggling, MILITARY # 9S# Miraa Sayyed Muhammad JChan Mir Husseini, Chief of the Amnieh (Road Cuard) detaohracnt at Bam, was put under arrest and brought to Kerman in the beginning of the month, as the result of various complaints and charges of corruption and extortion brought against him, and Sarhang Baqir Khan of the Central Amnieh Adminis tration arrived from Tehran to enquire into the cane. ,y ir TTusaeini, *ho was at first under detention in the Am-nieh Barracks, was rsaoved to the Military quarter Guard at the end of the month# , 93.

The idea of importing a mill for the spinning of cotton yarn in Kerman has again suggested itself to the leading traders here , as the result of a recent visit to Shiraz and Isfahan by one of the Kerman deputies and his tnspection of the spinning mills at those two cities* Messrs I’timad-ud-Tujjar at Shiraz and Kazeruni at Isfahan are said to have promised to participate in the project by contri buting one of the two million rials - the initial amount re quired for the purpose. Thei The matter has been submitted to the Court at Tehran and the necessary permission obtained* 120. Reference paragraph 30 (b)# The Bank of Agriculture at Tehran have already expressed their willingness to contribute Rials 700,000 towards the forma tion of a company, with a capital of one million rials, for the promotion of carpet industry in Kerman* 121. Reference paragraph 88. The si\imp in the carpet business is becoming more marked and the number of weavers falling out of work is increasing in Kerman# Further deputations of the un-employed waited upon the Covernor- General during the month, and steps were taken by the Police to find out if there were no malignant motives at work at the bottom of these demonstrations. The case of a bankrupt weaver committing suicide was brought to notice during the month and there were rumours of a few other suspicious deaths amongst the carpet weavers under similar cir cumstances. The local authorities are trying hard to find some way of easing the position by, among other things, expediting the construction of new military barracks and other Government buildings, in order to provide employment for a number of men who would be content if they could even earn their living as coolies# Tailors and other craftsmen have made representations to Tehran, requesting for the issue of permission to the military authori ties to get the soldiers 1 uniform made locally in Kerman, instead of at Tehran and Isfahan as has been done heretofore. 122. Two or three speculators who appear# to have had fore knowledge of the Government’s intention to raise the premium of export certificates, as the result of the recent sudden fall in the foreign exchange, during March, managed to buy from some of the foreign firms certificates in respect of very nearly one million rials of merchandise, at 134 per cent. When the premium was raised shortly afterwards to 30 per cent, the sellers refused to deliver the certificates at the low ratesrates for yfaioh they had been sold, on the ground that such a transaction would be detrimental to the interests of the carpet industry, for the prtection of which the Government had decided to change the rate of the premium, and also because the National Bank of Iran, ^iio had made similar contracts, refused to fulfil them, unless the difference between the new and old rates were paid by the buyers* The matter has recently been referred by the buyers to the local courts for decision, and the two parties are now taking steps to fight the case through# 123# A company was formed in Kerman during February, with the sole monopoly for business in sugar, and a capital of Rials 500,000 (about £6,250). This has recently been raised to Rials 750,000, the additional Rials 250,000 having been contri buted by traders at Rafsinjan (100,000), Sirjan (100,000) add Bam (50,000)# During the first three months (ending 22-5-35) the total sales of this company amounted to about 60,000 Tabriz Mans (each T.M. being equivalent to about 106-g ounces), including part of the reqjLiirements of Rafsinjan and Sir jan. 124.

Orders were received from Tehran by the Road authorities, at the latter part of the month, to inspect the roads from Kerman to Jiruft, Shahdad and Meshed, with a view to the construction of proper motor roads# According to the estimate arrived at by the Governor-General, as the result of his recent enquiries, the construction of a motor road between Kerman and Jiruft would cost approximately Rials 5,000,000o 5,000,000 (about £62,500 - at the present rate of exchange), which is considerably more than was at first estimated* MISCELLAJTBOUS * 127. The Right Reverend Br.

The annual drill competition of the C.M.S. Boys 1 school took place on the school premises on the 22 nd. The school is divided into three houses and each house competed. The first item was the march past, when the salute was taken by the Officer Commanding Kerman Brigade. The drill was in two parts, viz. marching and physical exercises; among the Judges were an army officer and the local Director of Physical Training. When the drill was over, a relay race was run, followed by some exhibition on the vaulting horse, and a tug-of-war, in the latter each house supplied a team. The last item was a relay obstacle race. At the conclusion of the physical exercises, the school lined up facing the guests and sang the Iranian national Anthem, after which the Governor-General made a short speech and read out the results of the competition. Among the guests were the Governor-General, the Officer Commanding His Majesty’s Consul and the heads of various government offices, as well as many of the European residents in Kerman. 129.

The news of the terrible earthquake at Quetta was received with great alarm at Kerman, as rumours got about that last year a vernacular Indian news-paper had predicted earthquakes during 1935 in Mazandaran, Quetta and Kerman, and that, as the prediction had proved correct in the case of the first two places, Kerman was sure to be the next. Somfl^jeople also remembered that, a few years ago, exactly seven days after an earthquake had taken place in Quetta a shock was felt in Kerman. For several days the majority of the inhabitants, including officer and men of the Kerman Brigade, slept out of doors and took other precautions. That the catastrophe was eventually Averted was put down, by the pious few at any rate, to the chief Mujtahid of Kerman, who had been warned of the impending danger in a dream, by spending the night of the 6th near an old mosque, some 4 miles outside the city, in prayers and supplication, together with a large number of the inhabitants. 144.

There has been a great fall in the Customs Revenue for the first four months and the local Director has been asked hy the Central Government to explain the reason. Owing to prohibition of yarn and cotton piece goods, which were the chief items of import of Bandar Abbas, the revenue naturally declined. The other reasons may be attributed to the highhanded policy of the customs in valuing goods much higher than the actual cost, which compelled the merchants to import their goodSr through Bushire and other Ports. For this reason there has been a great decline in the number of passengers coming from India during this season. Lately the examination of passengers* luggage has been very strict and heavy duties are charged for small articles. Clothes, even if they appear new, are subject to heavy duty. 249. Mohamed Hassan Ardeshiri of Customs Smuggling Depart ment was seen not wearing a hat and arrested by the Police. He was taken to the Police Office where after some questions he was told to go, but apparently for uttering some insinuating words he was imprisoned. He was released on bail pending trial after a period of 12 days. The charge framed against him by the Police was “high treason based on political grounds'*. Complaints have been made to Tehran against Raise Nazmieh and it is heard * th 4 t his substitute has left Shiraz. 250. Reference paragraph 215 of last diary. AQ.ai Ali Amini the ex-i^udir of Char bar committed suicide at Kishm on 19th, probably due to some sordid investiga tions regarding his office at Char oar.

Owing to the death of Agha Ali Amini, Ustevar Kaffee, who created trouble with this mudir and was imprisoned for a month was released on the 15th. 251. The export of' cotton was prohibited from 4th mlehre and a company has been formed to deal in Iran cotton. Several- merchants of Yezd and Rafsinjan heard of this prohioition only a few days oefore the Law was enforced, and managed to clear all their stock from Customs for export. A consignment of 1000 bales is lying on the pier awaiting shipment per a German steamer due here shortly. They are destined for Germany and owing to this sudden purchase by merchants the price quickly rose from Rials 8 to Rials 14 per Man. Even in this the Direc tor of Customs under-valued the price of cotton, but for the interference of the Manager of the National Bank of Iran, who said that the Bank would lose heavily, a reasonable price was fixed. jl 252. The Governor, as a representative of the Ministry of Economics announced that all merchants, possessing prohibited goods such as silk and artificial silk piece-goods, should hand these over for sale on behalf of the owners at their price. On the recommendation of the Manager of the National Bank of Iran, the Governor has appointed Messrs kehrji &amp; Co., a British concern, to sell these goods in their stores on account of the Ministry of Economics and 3 $ of the sale pro ceeds will be recovered from the owners and paid to them as remuneration. All confiscated and smuggled goods which have hitherto been auctioned by the Customs, will be sold by Messrs Mehrji and Company on the above terms. Silver is now practically non-existant, It is either smuggled or being hoarded by the Banks. No small change is obtainable in the bazaar, and the people have to face great difficulties. Even for getting change one is often asked for a discount in the bazaar. When the Military Department asked the local Bank 253. There is a very dearth of silver and copper coins for • •.for small change for the payment of salaries to the soldiers, the Manager refused, saying that five Rial notes should he given for distribution among so many men. He, however, issues to the Consulate nickle and 10 shahi copper coins sparingly. ^During the course of conversation the Manager of the National Bank said that he received instructions from Tehran to collect all silver coins and store them until further instructions, and the nickle and copper coins should he issued in small quantities. 254. The first consignment of cotton piece-goods, 214 hales ordered hy the SHIRKAT SEHAMI GHCMASH (Company for the import of monopolised piece-goods) arrived here from Japan on the 24th September per S.3« 'Manju Maru' and another shipment is expected at the beginning of October. Of these, 105 hales are for Bandar Abbas district. The sole monopoly for the import of piece-goods is given to this Shirkat and the National Bank of Iran is to work here as Agents for distribution of these goods to East Iran. An additional clerk on a salary of Rials 400 (about £ 5) per mensem is being engaged. Various samples have already been rece||j ved here by the Bank and are varied, duraole and attractive, and will surely appeal to Iranian tastes. On being demanded by the Customs for Import Permit, the Manager of the National Bank referred the matter to Tehran by telegram. The local Director of * Customs recfig^ed instructions from Tehran that licence is not required for samples of no value. 255. Reference paragraph 192 of diary No. 7 of 1935. It seems that Colonial Hats were actually prohibited from the very beginning, but some shipments arrived here and were cleared 0 n guarantee without import permits, through the ignor ance of the parties concerned, The Ministry of Economics have allowed the parties to redeem their guarantees by giving an ordi nary permit for felt hats, but no more of these Colonial hats will be allowed to be cleared. 256.

DEATH OF H IS LATJB MAJESTY KING GrBOKC E V* 2 . The news of the death of His Majesty King George V came as a great shock to the British Community in Kerman* Many people called at the Consulate to offer their condolences* All British Subjects went into mourning. On Saturday,25th January, the British Community collected at the Consulate to receive the condolences of the Iranian Officials. The Governor-General offered his condolences in writing as he said he was indisposed. However, every one knew that His Excellency attended other ceremonies in spite of his indisposition. Only the Assistant Governor from the officials attended the reception. But over forty Iranian genolemen and merchants came. Such a gathering of Iranians Li has not been seen at the Consulate for many years. Several more would have come had they not been ordered not to attend by the Governor General, who they saw r on their way to the reception. Three C.I.D. police were stationed at the gate, and all Iranians who came were sent for next day by the Rais-i-nazmieh. On Sunday 26th, a special Memorial Service was held at St. Andrew’s Church. The Assistant Governor attended- also a number of Iranian gentlemen. All British and British Indian Subjects were present, and a special Prayer was saidof... in Urdu.

Censorship.The Folice Authorities here still continue to censor all doubtful letters and all Foreign Newspapers. They have special instructions not to interfere with Consular mails, and I have been unable to find any trace of tampering with sealed envelopes. 5 . Fi nance . The cost of opium for local consumption was increased with effect from 1st Bahman 1314 (23rd Jarl) from Rials l/25 to Rials,1/35.

It is said that his town planning shchme,if approved,will be put into effect, and the Municipal Committee will not be allowed to diverge from it. He arrived on the 19th, and is hard at work. It is also proposed that the Khiaban (Avenue) Shahpur shall be continued to Zarisf and a circus and garden will be laid out just outside the Consulate gate. Red flags mark the extention, but as the line passes through a number of houses and gardens,it will probably take years to complete. It appears to be unproductive work, as there are few houses at this end of the town, and the town tends to spread in the otherTehran... 10 Reference para 360 of Diary NOj_l£ of 1935» The Order for the unveiling of women has to come into effect. The Governor General has been ordered to Tehran and local rumour says that the ^ais-i-muarif has reported him for slackness in enforcing unveiling. The Governor General showed great and sudden energy in •encouraging** unveiling in the middle of the month, after receiving his orders to go to Tehran, He gave a number of receptions to officials and their wives (Unveiled), and * photographs were taken to he sent as evidence to Tehran. A number of men well known to he married replied to invitations that they H had no wives** or were •indisposed*'. The Head of each Mohalla was ordered to give a reception to the women of his Mohalla, hut it has had no noticeable effect so far. An order has been promulgated that only prostitutes may he veiled, and they must he. Hven the fear of being mistaken for a prostitute has not encouraged many women! The Military have been ordered to he in readiness to co-ordinate with the Police in the event of riots and Martial Law will he declared if there is any trouble. So far no trouble has been noticed. On the other hand little unveiling has been noticed either! All officials have to draw their pay accompanied by their wives unveiled. The advance of pay to all Government servants to pay for new clothes for their wives has been promised. The lower grades complain that they will never to he able to pay off the advance. The Governor General tried to get a few leading men to raise funds to help the poor to buy new clothes for their wives. It was not a success!. 11.

Aqayi ^-zvini, M.P. &amp;fr Kerman, arrived here on a short visit towards the end of the month. He wanted to oall on the British Community on the £5th (see para 2 above) bui&gt; was ordered not to do so by the Governor General. 15. f ool Cardi n g Factor y.

A conscript from Yezd committed suicide in the barracks by taking an overdose of opium. 18. Sarhang II Nasrullah Khan, Director General of Military Music, arrived from Tehran on the 28th on inspection. 19. The C arnet Monopoly .The rumour that the Govern## ment have decided to take over the designing and sale of carpets, has caused great consternation among carpet merchants, especially the foreigners. They believe that they will be given one year's gracein which to dispose of their existing stocks. After that they may not deal direct with the weavers, nor may they export direct to the markets, but must place their orders through the Monopoly Company. They say this will kill the carpet trade. The intorduction of another and unnecessary 'Middleman' will raise the prices and the markets are not prepared to pay more. America has nearly 5 years stocks of carpets on hand, 'Ready Goods', i.e. carpets of common design fetch low prices, and only those in close touch with markets can produce designs which will please the public. As a result Iran will he unahle to sell her carpets, and the industry will he ruined. One official told a foreign merchant that if America refused to huy Iranian carpets in the ordinary way, Iran would refuse to buy American Motor Cars unless they were upholstered with Iranian carpetsJ Several merchants are considering starting carpet making in Afghanistan or India Bandar t Ah has.

G-hanei was formerly an Inspector in Kerman* Hassan Tavana, the local member of the Majlis and an ex-President of the Iranian Carpet Company, arrived in Kerman on the 20th December. (b) Military . General Tajbaksh, the Military Governor of Mekran, arrived at Kerman on the 21st and left for Tehran the following day* His sudden recall to the Capital from whence he had only recently returned gave rise to a crop of rumours of v/hich the most likely is that he has been selected by the Shah for advancement, possibly under the central Road Guards Adninis tration. General Roohallah Mirza Jahanbani arrived from Tehran on the 1st and proceeded to Mekran the same day. ' He returned to Kerman on the 21st and left for Tehran the following day. Lt-Colonel Bahrami, the commander of the Kerman Infantry, also arrived from Tehran on the 1st and accompanied General Jahanbani to Mekran.Colonel Shahlal arrived from Ru&amp;bar on the 6th, after making over the detachment to ^ajor Allahyar Bahadini# The former proceeded to Tehran on the ICth for a course at the Military Academy. Ill- LOCAL CCVSRmnhT . 358. (a) General « The Governor has received instructions from the -Ministry of Interior to prepare and submit a list of all foreign subjects residing in Kerman, including members of this Consulate staff. 359. Under the reorganisation scheme introduced by the Ministry of Interior the G 0 vernfli2l*4 of Kerman now styles himself as ,T Farmandar-i-Kerman n (para 317). But from enquiries made he has not as yet been made subordinate to the Astandar of the Southern As tan for official purposes, and continues direct contact with the Ministry. 360. (b) Foo nomic Conations . It is reported that the local Grain Monopoly department is functioning under diffi- culties* There is much suffering among the poorer classes due to the shortage of grain and the consequent closing of some of the bakeries. There is a marked increase in the number of beggfl^s, due largely to the influx of ill-nourished villagers who have had to resort to this form of existence. They make a depressing sight. It is learnt that the bread shortage is particularly acute in the Mahan, Bam and ^irjan areas. This descent upon Kerman of beggars from the surrounding country has at least had the effect of causing the local government to move in the matter. The Governor has raised a local fund to establish a temporary ’asylum 1 where the needy can receive food and lodging. This is a verylaudable effort for the genuine poor, but it will require police action to remove the now large number of professionals from the Kerman streets. During the last few months about 7,400 maunds of wheat has been brought into Kerman from Isfahan and Hamdan, which eased the situation to some extent. ?he price fixed by the Monopoly for wheat is rials 250 per Kharwar of 650 lbs, but the actual Bazar rate is between rials 370 and 400* It is understood that practically all^ the wheat imported from India via Zahidan is being absorbed in eastern Iran. None has so far been brought to Kerman* The price of barley has now reached rials 250 per kharwar of 100 Tabriz! maunds(6t lbs). The highest price in 1936 was rials 100* Meat is 12 rials per maund ( 6i lbs) , but the quality is very poor. The price of fuel has also advanced beyond the normal seasonal increase* In November firev/ood was rials 120 per kharwar (100 maunds); by the middle of December it was rials 170, and the increase continues. Vital statistics for the month are not avail able, but it is reported that the number of deaths from exposure and starvation (generally recorded as n heart failure”) .is much above the average* The prevailing prices of food-stnff are:- November December Wheat Rials 320 • 350 ) *) Barley n 200. 250.) 170.) per Kharw Fuel n 120* Meat n 12. 12.) ) per maund Rice rt 8. 10.)

IV- MILITARY AFFAIRS . 362. The conscription committee terminated its Kerman session on the 6th December* 363. Early in the month two companies of the local infantry regiment proceeded to the hills 5 miles North-East of Kerman for field exercises, which lasted three days* 264. Se curity * At the beginning of December a band of about 150 armed Baluchis attempted to plunder a number of villages near Shahdad, 63 miles North- East of Kerman. A company of infantry moved out from Kerman on the 2nd and are reported to h&amp;ve made contact with the raiders and to have driven them up to the Dasht-i Rudbar. Instructions were issued to the detachments at ^udbar and Ba m to intercept the raiders* way out, but the latter broke up into small parties and made good their escape to the hills* V.

Ill - LOCAL GOVERNMENT . 10. Health . The Health Ofiicer, Henjam, at the request of the inhabitants of Minab, has been ordered to move to the latter place. 11. Post and Telegraphs . On the 19th, an insured cover from Lingah addressed to the local branch of the National Bank, containing rupees 57^/- in Indian currency notes and silver was found to be missing from the Post Office. S.S. 'Bamora' was in harbour, and all the mail bags from Bandar Abbas were opened on board by the Superintendent of Posts and a representative of Customs in search forthe missing cover, but without result. The Clerk in charge of tne Post ofiice was subsequentyly arrested by the Police pending further enquiries. 12. Mines . The Director ol Mines in Iran, arrived from Tehran on the cSrd and returned on the 16th. During his stay he visited the mines at Hormuz, Namakdan, and Bostaneh near Lingah. He is believed to have expressed the opinion,which coincides with that ol the Governor, that the product of the Hormuz miles is superior to that of Namakdeni, though the salt Iron the latter mines has always been preferred by loreign geologists. If the result is to restore to the Snerkat-i- (k( Namak the working of the Namakdan mines, it may^that the conflicting opinion upon the respective qualities is not entirely due to ignorance. lo. Economic Conditions. The general condition of the inhabitants of Bandar Abbas compares favourably with Kcii- inland districts, e.g. Kerman. Though earning capacity is probably le.-S, this is of 1 set by essential foodstuffs being cheaper and the fact that the mild winter o of Bandar Abbas reacts more favourably to undernjirishment than the cold of the interior. There is, however, much unemployment among cargo coolies owing to the big reduction itCfor^egn trade. Bo/ie h&amp;ve been absorbed in the building works now in progress, but the rate for this class of labour is rials 2/- (6 d) r day, whereas as cargo coolies tney were able to earn from 5 to 8 rials per day. The Bandar Abbas bazar is fairly veil stocked, but little business is oeing done. A feature is the complete absence of beggCrs. This is due to the provision of an 'asylum' where destitutes can be housed and fed, am they are now barred from street begging by tne Governor.

Colonel Shaibani,the Commander of the Kerman cavalry regiment^ has been appointed to officiate as Commander of the Kerman Brigade, in the absence of Colonel Seyahpoush in Bashagird (para 3). Ill - LOCAL GOVERNMENT. (a) General. According to the Press the Administratior scheme which is to come into ox&gt;eration from the 15th Urdibehesht 1317 (5th May 1938), provides for a Kerman Division (istan) which includes the subordinate Governorates of Kerman, Sirjan, Bam, Bandar Abbas, Khwash, and Zabul (Sistan), with headquarters at Kerman. Such an arrangement is curious geographically for it constitutes a narrow administrative belt from . • . . /—sZabul on the Afghanistan frontier in the east to the port of Bandar Abbas in the Persian Gulf in the 7/est. In view of the extent and importance of the new division, local officials are now of the opinion that the present Governor of Kerman is too junior to be appointed Istandar and that a more senior official will be sent to fill this appointment, (b) Economic conditions. During February about 300 Kharwars of wheat were brought into Kerman from Khoramabad, Hamadan and Isfahan. There is still hov/- ever a considerable shortage in the surrounding villages and it is reported that the local Gfain Monopoly Department has been ordered by Tehran through the Governor to supply the villages with suificient wheat and bread. But the Department is finding it difficult to carry out these orders and meet the demands of the town. The number of recorded deaths in Kerman town for the month of Bahman (&amp;&amp;nd January - 21st February) is 183. The statistics for the urban district are not available, but the number of deaths is believed to be above normal. IV - MILITARY AFFAIRS. Coup d f etat. The 22nd February was observed as public holiday, in honour of the 17th anniversary of the Coup dietat. The visual military review was held concluding with a March Past in front of a photograph of His Majesty the Shah. Only senior local officials were invited to attend. Captain Jamshid, the officer in charge of the Kerman Camel Corps^ was arrested on the 14th and despatched to Tehran under military escort. His arrest is reported to be connected with some affair which occured when he was in the Shiraz Division. Captain Jamshid who is an Iranian Amenian, has av L u~ i r Russian wife. V - BRITISH I NTERESTS . NIL, VI - FOREIGN INT ERESTS, 28, Mr. Ivan Youstroff of Russian nationality and an agriculturist in the employ of the Tehran Cotton Monopoly, visited Kerman from 14th to 21st February. During his stay he also visited Rafsinjan Ravar and ^erand. He was accommodated in the Kerman club. VII- MISCELLANEOUS . 29. Commercia l. The recently issued Foreign Exchange Regulation by which 50^ of the exchange resulting from all exports is to be sold to the Government at a fixed rate of 80 to the £ and the balance utilised to meet importers requirements, has caused considerable consternation among the local carpet dealers - an industry which provides about 75$ of the Kerman export trade. The foreign merchan ts are faced with heavy losses, which must react on the weaving community in general, if the Regulation is not modified. Practically all the leading carpet merchants have submitted a combined representation in this matter to the Central Government through the Governor. 50. Travellers. H.R.H. Prince Peter of Greece arrived in Kerman from Yezd on 12th February. The Governor who was instructed by Tehran to facilitate the visit arranged for the Prince to stay with Mons. Timoyanaki, a Greek subject. Prince Peter left for Tehran on the 21st, with the intention of visiting India via Meshed and Zahidan. Dr. and Mrs. Carpenter of tne C.M.S. returned to Kerman on 6th, after spending three days snow-bound in the hills between Sirjan and Kerman Baroness Blixen and Mrs.3ayaghall,whoare motoring from Calcutta, arrived in Kerman from Zahidan on 26th February, and left for Yezd and Isfahan on the 28th* BANDAR - ABB A S_*, I - BRITISH OFFICIALS, NIL. II - IRANIAN OFFICIALS&gt; Yawar Juhan Ara, Chief of Police Bandar Abbas, proceeded on inspection to Charbar on the 28th. Ill - LOCAL GOVERNMENT. Posts &amp; Telegraphs. Owing to heavy snow between Bardsir and Sir Jan, the mails between Kerman and Bandar Abbas were held up for about ten days at the beginning of the month. The telegraph line was not Effected. Electric Plant. Two German Electrical Engineers arrived from Tehran on 21st to erect the new plant (para 342)• Bank-i-Milli. It is learnt that the local branch has received orders from Tehran to withhold 1000 rials notes from circulation, owing to a number of counterfeit notes believed to have been brought into Iran from India. Economic. Contrary to the reaction of the Kerman carpet exporters to the new exchange regulation (para 29 supra),the Bandar Abbas merchants, who are mainly interested in imports, hope to derive some commercial benefit from 50^ exports exchange to be utilised for imports. But a very heavy premium is required by sellers and the price now is about 150- 160 rials to the £, or double the official rate. Cost of imports at this rate will of course be passed on to the consumer. IV - MILITARY. Coup d f etat. The 22nd February was observed as- i - 37. 38. 39. 40. 41. public holiday, in honour of the 17th anniversary of the coup d*etat, and a reception was held in the evening in the Military Hospital.

The troops are said to be returning overland to their stations via Minab and are escorting the leaders to Bandar Abbas - The presence of Abdul Hussain Kameran among the captives is doubted. 23,000 kilos of dates were distributed free among the poverty stricken inhabitants of Sirik by the Military, and a consignment of vtfieat is also under issue to relieve the food situation there. Conscription. The local conscription department which was put under Persian Baluchistan on the reduction of the Bandar Abbas garrison last July has now been attached to Kerman. V - NAVAL.

It is not known if a sale was finally effected or the amount disposed of. But it appears that this dealer in an endeavour to make up his required monthly sales, has, of late, been boarding these steamers at Bandar Abbas and making&amp;ales to the crew anc others. The retail price of opium at Bandar Abbas is Trails 2/- ( 6 .d) per misqal (one sixth of an ounce). Destitutes.

For the present the Finance Department is issuing opitira for local consumption to licensed shop keepers for retail sale. The big drop in the tenders is doubt less due to the ruaour that action to reduce opium consumption is contemplated by the Central Govern ment authorities, and alec to the embargo pieced on sales on British ships as a result of represen tations made by this Consulate. The embargo is reported to be effective. (o) Hunicipality . The Central Government has me do a grant of rials 380,000 (£.4,750) to the local Municipality for the year 1317. Trade and Develooevents.
