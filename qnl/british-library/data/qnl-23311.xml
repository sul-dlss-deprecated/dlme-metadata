My dear Pelly, I have had a letter from our Acting Manager, msrah Petroleum Company, Basrah, in which he asks what are the prospects in Bahrein of finding a temporary home as a paying guest for a Belgian lady. The circumstances are as under:- Our Manager was approached by the British consul Oeneral, Basrah, on behalf of a certain %demoiselle Corbiau. This lady wishes to visit Bahrein to earn money by painting portraits. She has spent some years in India, has visited the Persian oil fields and Basrah and is apparently collecting funds to make her way home. She thinks Bapco offers scope for her talents. The Consul General, Basrah, guarantees that she is not an undesirable. Our Manager adds that she is 40ish. Apparently the Consul General’s idea is that some one in Manama or Bapco might be prepared to accommodate her. The consul General did not suggest that any reference should be made here to you but it occurred to me that you should know of this suggestion in case you have not been notified officially. In my view the obvious place for her is Bapco; firstly because the buildings are air-conditioned and food is not difficult and secondly her sitters are likely to be found in Bapco and she should not be separated from them by 12 miles. I imagine the Consul General approached our people under the impression that P.C.L.,Bahrein was a miniature Abadan and we could find the lady plenty of clients. I do not think it is appropriate for me to sponsor the lady in Manama and less still in Bapco. I am sure any attempts by me to fix her up in Awali will receive very short shrift from the Management even if they are not resented. In all the circumstances I feel that this lady will have i a much better chance if her problem is put to the community by you. Apparently she wishes to make her visit about the end of the month .f and the Consul General, Basrah, is prepared to grant her a visa for Bahrein provided so melons is prepared to furnish an undertaking that he or she is prepared to provide the necessary accommodation and messing. I must apologise for adding to your problems but I am afraid it might be misunderstood if I offer to put her up myself, and I do not think it likely that I shall be able to persuade anybody Contd- 2 - else to take her in. If you will prefer me to send a reply that I am not in a position to help, please let me know. I hesitated to do this without reference to you as it is not outside the bounds of possibility that the portrait scheme will appeal to some of the Awali inhabitants. Yours sincerely, C. J.
