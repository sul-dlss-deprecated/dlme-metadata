Local Manager 3 Petroleum Concessions Limited 9 Bahrain s returned from India on the 3rd January. 4 * NevV Y e ar Da y Cn the 1st January the customary New Year visits were paid at the Agency. Kin Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin : 1sa a1 Kha1ifah, K.C C ? Ruler of Bahrain, together with his brothers and members of the family paid his call at 9.20 a c mo The Shaikh expressed his pleasure at the British successes in Libya and the successes of the Greeks, with British help, against the Italians in Albania. His health seems to be better this year than previously. At 10.30 a..m 0 a Majlis v 'as held in the Agency Majlis Room where the Arab and other notables were present and listened to the Political Agent : s annual speech. Ac 12 noon British and American residents paid their visits and crank the health of the King Emperor. The Agency flagstaff was decorated that day. * v 5. 5 Id al P aha ? Id al Duha was observed in Bahrain on the 8th and 9th January. The Political Agent, accompanied by the Assistant Political Agent and the Indian Assistant, paid the customary visits to His Highness the Shaikh, the leading members cf the Al Khalifah family and other Arab notables. Local Af fairs 'i) Th Pol: question of the high rates cnar, viz. 7 as. per unit. Those high discontent, amongst the consumers cal Agent has taken up with the State the electric current - are the cause of and an obstacle to -p 0 t rates here others who would like ,o enjoy the benefits of electricity. (ii) A section of the Hindu merchants have recently been complaining against the Food Control. A meeting was arranged at the Customs at which the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and the Director of Customs who is also the Food Controller were present and the Political Agent brought the complainants to enable them to state their difficulties on the spot. The results though not conclusive serve to show that the Food Control Order is not being properly observed. The matter is being further pursued. (iii) On che 5th January, the Political Agent visited the local ice plant which is run by a prominent Arab merchant, Mr. Hussein Yateem. The plant is most efficiently run with the very minimum of expense. During winter the plant is in charge of one man who turns out sufficient ice to meet local demands. This is worked by a 25 k/w power plant which was installed by Mr. Hussein Yateem after he found himself unable to pay the excessive rates demanded by the State Electric Department. (iv) Khan Sahib Haji Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo has been very agitated recently over the cutting off of his water connec tions by the Manama Municipality owing to non-bayment of water /-3 water rates by him. He claims that the well which is in the middle of the property recently sold by him to the State was not included in the sale. The State on the other hand assert that it was. Finally Usuf Kanoo approached Shaikh Hamad in the matter who has now ordered the resump tion of Yusuf Kanoo’s water supply. (v) It is understood that Abdul Aziz Oosaibi approached Shaikh Hamad with a request for permission to sell his house at Hafa to Ibn Saud. It is thought possible that this might be an attempt to induce Shaikh Hamad to buy the pro perty, which is a white elephant, himself. It is known that the firm of Q.osaibi are in low water; hence their desire to realise on the property in question. There may on the other hand be something behind the request, as members of the Saudi family occasionally do pass through Bahrain and they might feel the need of having a rest house here. It is learnt now that the Shaikhs are very much opposed to the sale of the house as they anticipate diffi culties in controlling the behaviour of the younger members of T»he Saudi family who might wish to use it. Nothing more has been heard of the proposal which has probably been abandoned, (vi) The new Agency tennis court has now been completed and promises to be quite satisfactory. (vii) Tfefe death was announced on the 3rd January of Shaikh Jassim bin Mahza, the Chief Sunni Oadhi, at the age* it is said, of 110 years. Shaikh Jassim had been Sunni Oadhi in Bahrain for over 40 years during the time of the late Shaikh ’Isa. He was considered a very learned man and much respected by all communities. The bazaar was closed on that day as a mark of respect. 7. Persian Gulf Fighter Fund Contributions have amounted to Ps 27,744/- and £ 75/5. 8. Publ i c Ooinlon The public are much pleased at the successes in Bardia and it is considered locally that the Italian army in Africa has already been broken. 9. Italian Broad cast It is reported that the following was broadcast from Rome on the 10th January : The majority of the shares of the Petroleum Company in Bahrain Island in the Persian Gulf have changed into American hands, as Great Britain was obliged to sell 50,000 shares of this Company to the United States of America. When some weeks ago these Islands were bombed by Italian airmen these oil wells were still in British hands. 3# hoisting stars and stripes they obviously believe they are immune from further attacks. The transfer of shares also reveals according to Italian press increasing liquidation of British property in favour of United Gtates of America. 10. S aud i A rabia It is reported that two of the American geologists of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company Limited who were /-4 were working in an outlying camp about 15 miles west of Hofuf heard the sound of low-flying aircraft overhead about 1 a*nu on the 8th January. The machine appeared to be flying from the west toward Hofuf and the Coast. 11. Trucial Coast It was reported from Sharjah that a very loud and long explosion was heard about 5.30 p.m. on the 9th January in Sharjah coming from the direction of Kalba and estimated to be between 60 and 70 miles away. The cause of the explosion is not yet known. 12.

Local Affairs . (i) On the 16th January at 6.30 p.m.the Political Agent attended a dinner given by Mr. Lipp, General Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, in his house at Awali, to which His Highness Shaikh Hamad, his brothers and sons were also invited. This dinner seems to be an annual affair. Food was in the best American style and was much appreciated if not by His Highness at least by the others. * After dinner a colour film depicting the visit of Shaikh Mohammad bin ’Isa to the World’s Fair at New York was shown. Others present were Commodore Cosmo Graham, the Senior Naval Offi cer, and Mr. Belgrave, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. (ii) On the 25th morning at 11 a.m. a meeting of the Anti malaria Committee was held in the BaleAiyeh. The Political Agent also attended the meeting. The work of the past year was reviewed and fresh measures for the continuation and expansion of programme were decided on. (iii) On the 22nd January a census was held throughout the Islands. There were several interesting rumours amongst the population regarding the object of the census, though there was no opposition to it. Some of the rumours current were : introduction of identity cards 5 introduction of conscription| expulsion of Iranians 1 compulsory medical. (viii) Shaikh Abdullah bin ♦Isa al Khalifah paid a visit to the Political Agent on the morning ofthe 27th J January. He spoke strongly on the subject of nooular feeling against Mr. Steele, the State Engineer, who he said was generally disliked in Bahrain whole interests he ignores. He said that it was the general impression that public money was being wasted in the Bahrain Engin eering Department under Mr. Steele.3 examination etc. (iv) The Anglo-Iranian has telegraphed to K.^.Nasib, their Muscat agent 5 as Tollows 'Vessel Marzuk arrived Aden district carrying 500 tons can you trace exporters'. They have also asked K.S. Hussain Amad, their Sharjah agent Tor the quantity sold to exporters and consignments shioped by themj also for the quantity in Dubai not yet shiapedt These may indicate contraband trade in oetrol or kerosene from Muscat and Sharjah, possibly to Italian East Africa. (v) Abdul Aziz Ali al Bassam ( a local Saudi merchant) has taken up^the Agency of the Isbandosten Mollur Line. This line sails from New York, Philadelphia dnd Baltimore. The steamers are expected to carry cargo for Saudi Arabia. (vi) Vegetable ghee is now being imported into Bahrain from the Dutch i^ast Indies. It used to come from Holland before the German occupation but now it is coming from the Dutch possessions in great quantities. Abdullah Aujah and Muhammad Tayib Khunji have Just imported 1208 cases of this ghee, believed to be sufficient for 6 months. ^(vii) A Turk by name Osman Ay Cingiz Yusuf Ziya, arrived in Bahrain from Iraq on the 20th January by the S.S. Bankura. He had visas in his passport valid for Kuwait and Bahrain granted by Consul, Baghdad. He had no kit except one small handbag. The object of his visit is not known. From letters seen in censorship it would apoear that Osman was a destitute in Japan from where he went*to Yeman. In Baghdad he was associated with Yemani students. One of his Yemani companions Sayid Hussain ai Kibsi has telegraphed a complaint against him to the Heir Apparent of the Yeman from Muscat. It appears that Osman either lost or made away with three boxes belonging to Al Kisi on embarkation at Basra. He has telegraphed to the Heir Apparent of the Yeman stating that Al Kibsi himself lost these boxes intentionally and also asking for £ 50/- to be sent to him through t h° Mutasarrif of Basra. It has been possible to collect the following dossier about Osman:- Son of a landowner near Ankara who supported Mustapha Kamal against the Greeks; apparently a 'soldier of fortune 5 aged 36 5 speaks 7 languages 5 was a 'mir alai' in Yeman where he commanded 3000 men in suppressing civil disorders caused by billeting troops in private houses 0 then tried to get to Kashgar at the time of the coud there (win ter ^1934 - 35); on failing in this went to China where he nominally taught Arabic to Chinese Muslims: actually appears to have been an agent of Chiang Kai Shek with this section: later went over to the Japanese; in Tokio met Hussain Al Kibsi, the agent there of the Yemani Heir Apparent: tra velled with him to Basra on the S.S. Mantai Maru which did not apparently stop in India. With them were 30 boxes of silk, tea, etc., presumably for the Heir Apparent. It was three of these boxes which Osman lost (or made av&gt;;ay with). He has now returned to Basra. 17 . Saudi Arabia . (i) The Saudi Government issued an order ea^ly in the month emorcing a payment of about Rs.30/- on all sailing vessels entering^Saudi territorial waters and the Saudi customs authorities started issuing receipts for the money which /■4 which read as follows:- ’’Received from a sum of Riyals 30 which is kept, as an Arpanah”. This increase in Saudi port, dues was said to be due to the recommendations of Inspector of Customs after a tour of inspection. The Kii old dues were from Rs. 2/8 to Rs. 4/8. Large boats continued^to sail for Saudi ports, with enhanced frei'ht charges, in spite of this large harbour tax but small 'boats ceased to ply. Abdul Aziz Zosaibi sent, a telegram to Ibn baud on behalf of the Bahrain boat owners, and Ibn Saud has now telegraphed Oosaibi and Abdul Aziz al Bassamto -^-furm kx® them that the new port dues have been waived. The oaudi Directorate General of Posts have agreed to the a pointment of two men to carry mails; one from Al Khobar to Bahrain and the other from Bahrain to Al Khobar every day. The man who arrives at Bahrain takes the mail to vu 'kbe following day and the man who arrives at Al Khobar with the mail returns to Bahrain the following day and so on.^ Their pay is to be Riyals 60 including the fee for into Bahrain which is about 7^ Riyals per month. The Al Khobar Postmaster is enquiring from Oosaibi if he can rind a man for this job. ° n 1 ^ h i _ J ’ anuar y? Ahmad Mansouri, the Saudi wireless Khobar &gt; accompanied by Muhammad Mirdad and Abduliah Othaman, Hejazi pearl merchants, and another trader named Abdullah al Wazzan entered the Cable and Wireless premises and asked to see round the station. Permission was refused by the Officer in Chhrge. (iv) It is rumoured that two men, one Italian and one Dutch ivnig in Saudi Arabia have embraced Islam. Names are being enquired after. ^ 18.

(i) On the 3rd February, I visited Shaikh Hamad at Sakhir, prior to going over to Qatar to visit the P.C.L. Camp at Riyan and pay a call on the Shaikh. Shaikh Hamad requested me to convey his regards to Shaikh Abdul lah bin Qasim, and to congratulate him on his safe return from the Haj. (ii) On the 6th February 1941, I visited the Zekrit Headquarters of Petroleum Concessions Limited in Qatar. I was entertained by Mr. Ensor, the Senior representative on the spot. Afterwards I proceeded to Riyan where I was entertained by Shaikh Abdullah bin Zasim. Shaikh Abdullah had with him Shaikh Hamad his son, and Saleh el Mana, his secretary and Adviser. Abdullah bin Darweesh was also seen at Zekrit. Shaikh Abdullah seemed to be in exceptionally good health. He had just come in from his desert camp. The opportunity was taken of conveying to him the greets ings of Shaikh Hamad bin 'Isa, Ruler of Bahrain, which he returned with every show of cordiality, although at the same time expressing regret at the present state of strained relations between the two Shaikhdoms, which was attributed to the fault of 'others”. The opportunity was taken of speaking to the Shaikh on the taxes levied by his son on Qatari employees of Petroleum Concessions Limited. The Shaikh apparently knew nothing of this. When he had gone out of the room, it was explained to me by the Indian doctor pf Petroleum Concessions Limited that taxes were levied by Shaikh Hamad, the son, without the knowledge of his father. I thereupon adked Shaikh Hamad whether such taxes had been levied and he replied, somewhat defiantly, that they were much less than those of other countries. I told him that in Bahrain no such taxes /-' ere ^ 1 ?u i ! d ,? n em P lc, y ee s of the Bahrain Petroleum -ompany and that it was not good policy to in any way namper the Company in its labour supply especially as the sum involved is a petty one. I said it was also rather unsuitable for him to take money from such poor people. After dinner J went to Dohar and returnedhy sea to Bahrain on the 'Felix Jones'. The trip back took 17 hours from Dohar. 22, British Interests ^ ^ Dr. B. A. Kennedy, Chief Local Representative, the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, returned from India bv air on the 4th February 1941. 23c M oveme nts of Foreign NotahlP.s . Mr. Mattison, of the American Legation in Baghdad, arrived in Bahrain by air on the 13th February 1941, on official business. T ’ ocal A ffa1rs. (i) On the 3rd February 1941, Dr. and Mrs, Storm of !j 5 e TT ^ me 5’ lcan Mls sion had a dinner, at which all the sons of^His Highness Shaikh Hamad bin 'Isa, except Shaikh Su- iaiman, yere present. Shaikh Khalifa bin Mohamad bin 'Isa and his two brothers and Hussain Yateem were there also. Other guests invited were Commodore and Mrs. Graham, the -olitical Agent and Mrs Alban and Dr. Barney of the Ameri- an Mn i. Shaikh Ali of Rufa was there also. The party was © success and some useful contacts were made. Most of the young men speak English and take a keen interest in local affairs. ^ (ii) A visit was received on the 3rd February from Abdullah bin Jabr, Secretary to His Highness, who had just returned from a pilgrimage to Mecca. He said that everywhere he had heard hopes of an early Italian defeat ana eankfulness for British victories. Conditions in arc much better owing to good rainfall this year. TT v:? ' i: -^ I ? ur ?-S g the P eriod under review, His Highness Shaikh , km Isa paid a visit to the Agency. It is signi- ficaikt perhaps that he came Unaccompanied. I was able to present the compliments of Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim of Qatar, which he had asked me to convey. His Highness spoke at greath length about the troubles which occurred in Qatar some years ago. He said that all the trouble in tatar was the doing of Shaikh Hamad, second son of Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim and of his evil genius, Abdullah bin Jarweesh. ^ His Highness also complained about the expen- ditu^c he h?s to bear on account of allowances to members or tn Ah ..vx.al. fah family, guests, etc. Civ.

The Political Agent and Mrs. Alban visited the Awali Camp at the invitation of Mr. Lipp, the General Manager, and were shown over the whole of the Camp and Refinery. New Concrete block quarters built for Bahrain- i labourers and personnel were particularly note worthy. These quarters are meticulously clean and cool, roofed with corrugated asbestos and pro vided with electric light, running water and cooking houses operated by gas, the cost of which works out at £ 40/- per head. The Commissariat, the Laundry, the linen store and spare parts department was visited. The Commissariat contains almost every known variety of food an&lt;Jl drink, stored under the most hygenic conditions. Articles are sold to members of the Companv at cost price only. The'Laundry is up- to-date and the charge per head is only Rs.12/- per month. Employees are provided also with all household furnishing, matresses, etc.* with the exception of sheets which they have to buy themselves. The cost of living for British employees at the Camp works out at a very low figure indeed. 25. Accession of the Shaikh of Bahrain * The Political Agent, accompanied by the Assistant Political Agent and Indian Assistant, pro ceeded to Manama Palace to pay their respects to and congratulate His Highness on the anniversary of his accession. Owing to complaints having been received that in the previous year no proper accommodation had been made for the British officials to be accommodated, the seating was arranged in the open at the foot of the Palace steps.

Dr. and Mrs Dame, prior to their departure to the United States of America, on leave, called at the Agency on the 17th February 1941. Bahrain notables paid a call on the Political Resident on the morning of the 18t$i. Thefollowing day, Shaikh Mohammad bin 'Isa, who had not accompanied the Shaikh of Bahrain on his visit to the Political Resident, paid a separate call on the Political Resi dent . On the evening of the 17th February, His Highness the Shaikh of^Bahrain gave a banquet in honour of the Political Resident.

Before the guests took their departure•&gt; His Highness presented the Political Resident with a oho- tograph of himself along with a cheque of Rs. 30,000/- for the Persian Gulf Fighter Fund. (ii) About the middle of the month, the or^ce of sovereigns rose fromRs.32/- to Rs.36/- to~Rs.36/4/-. The reason for this is probably due to the fact that mer chants dealing with Japanese firms received a telegram on the 16th February raising all prices by 25%. This- coupled with the uncertainty in the far east has caused some uncertainty. (iii) Prices of some Japnnese goods have only risen abo&amp;t 5 % and it i s stated by a prominent piece goods merchant that the stocks of Japanese piece goods in Bahrain will last for three years. Trade in Japanese goods received a set back as a result of a rumour^ spread in the bazaar on the afternoon of the 16th February that war had broken out between Japan and Great Britain.

Shaikh Muhammad bin Rahma of Baraimi paid a visit/ - 2 - to the Political Agent on the 13th March. He expressed his appreaiation of the British and his hope that they would be successful in the war. 39. Cocal Affair s. (i) On the 5th March, the Political Agent attended the Senior Joint Court in company with His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain. Three cases were dealt with. (ii) A petition containing some 60 signatures of promi nent merchants in Bahrain has been received complaining of excessive delay in censorbhip in India of air mail covers addressed to Bahrain. The average delay from the samples submitted amounted to 15^ days. The matter has been taken up. (iii) On the 7th March 1941, cricket and football matches, in aid of War Charities, were played in Manama. Among the large number of spectators present were Commo dore and Mrs. Graham, Major and Mrs. Alban, Mr and Mrs. Belgrave, Dr. and Mrs. Kennedy and Mr. and Mrs. deGrenier. Gate receipts amounted to about Rs.1100/- (iv) It is reported that there is dissatisfaction in Manama at^the number of middlemen allowed to carry on business in the fish market. The fish market belongs to Shaikh Dai'j bin Hamad, and he lets it out for Rs. 600/- per annum to a contractor who encourages numerous middle-men (known as Muta*ayyishah') because they each pay him a toll. This system used to obtain in Muharraq* but has been abolished by the Municipal Council there, with the result that fish can be bought there for one- third the price it costs in Manama. Some time ago, the Council proposed that the sys tem of the sale of fish should be revised 5 whereupon Shaikh Dai’j and Abdullah bin Jabur went and complained to His Highness, representing that Shaikh Dai’j’s mono poly of the fish market was imperilled. His Highness then wrote a letter to the Council, instructing them to ^r’op the matter. (v) It is understood that during a recent fire at Suwaifiyah village, on the northern shore of the Island, 15 houses were destroyed and that ammunition could be heard detonating in the flames. (vi)Yusuf Yasin (Secretary to Ibn Saud) has sent £. E.5 to the Editor of the ,f Al Bahrain'. (Note :- A year’s subscription to this paper is Rs.4/- so the remit tance is clearly to keep the Editor 'sweet' from Ibn Saud's point of viefi). (vii) It is reported that Yusuf Fakhroo, a prominent Bahrain merchant, opposed the wish of 20 Iranians living in Muharraq to adopt Bahrain nationality. (Note:- From this may be inferred, in conjunction with previous reports of Iranians’ expectations of a 'visit' from the Shah in the near future, that Yusuf Fakhroo has pan-Iranian aspi rations. (viii) The Chief Shia’ Qadhi, Abdul Hussein el Hilli, has been indulging in discussions of the policy of the ’Iraq ‘^nrnent, with an anti-British bias.3 99(ix) The sale of tickets for the school play ’'Italian Atrocities in Libya” in aid of the Persian Gulf Fighter Fund has called forth the comment ”what about a nlay on British atrocities in Palestine ?”. (x) The last mail to India, S.S. ’’Barala”, was full of Polish and Roumanian refugees. (xi) It is understood that the Bahrain Petroleum Company has 'laid off” about 40 drivers. (xii) A story is going round, based on a letter said to have been received by Yusuf Fakhroo, that a large dhow (nakhuda Abdullah bin Mohammad el Kingi) v/hich recently cleared from Aden with a cargo of salt, was stopped by a British warship. The dhow hoisted Iranian colours, out was fired on and sunk with the loss of all her crew except five. (xiii) -It is learned that Ahmad el Jabur, Secretary of Nadi el Mukhtalat el Riyadh! (i.e. Mixed Sports Club) sometimes lectures in the said Nadi styling himself as 'Hitler”. 40. Local Opinion (i) The Balkan situation has caused various comments. One theory is that Turkey’s attitude is one of bhckma.il on Britain to get all she can for herself and is compared with Russia’s attitude to Germany. It has also, rather surprisingly, been heard stated as an opinion that Turkey is true to her pledges and when the time comes will be joined by ’Iraq. Some people have said that Russia is waiting to help carve up Turkey as she did Poland. As far as the opinion of 'the common plebs' can be gauged, they welcome the news as bringing nearer the day when, they hope, Germans will turn out the British from the Middle Hast. The few maturer minds among them do, however, read aright the lessons of Poland, Holland, etc 5 and see the force, to themselves, of Hitler’s racial categorization of the world. Some comment is now being noticed in local majliSes as to the fate of * Iraq, Syria and other Muslim communities. (ii) An old date merchant, by the name of El’Amiri, when heard to curse the German radio, was asked the reason for his preference for the British. His reply was that he noticed older and God-fearing men who visited the mosques regularly were in favour of Britain winning the war. When reminded of Palestine, he said, 'Everyone is forgiven three mistakes; this is only their first'. (iii) Speculation is rife regarding Turkey’s attitude, the most common theory being that she will betray Britain in the end. Theposition of Persian! and Iraq under the Sa’adabad Pact, in the event of Turkey being ''attacked, was raised at a local majlis. It was thought that their hos tility to Britain would stop them from helning Turkey. The ragged and ill-fed condition of the Persian Army was commented on. The Soviet radio's recent expressions of disapproval of Bulgaria’s surrender have been considered by some sec tions to be a mere grick to allay suspScions of an actual league with Germany to divide up Turkey like Poland and Roumania. (iv) /-- 4 - (iv) Local rumour goes that the 'Vita' and 'Barpeta' have been sumk in the Bed Sea. Some even go so far as to say that a 11^the ships that are not on service have been sumk. This is not, however, generally believed; and another version is that the ships taken off service are taking war materials to India and Egypt. 41. Bahrain Petroleum Company . From a telegram seen in censorship, it appears that, owing to exchange difficulties, the Bahrain Petrol- eum Company may intend laying out a proportion of their pro!its in the Island, eg. buying tug boats at present on mre, or building quarters for employees other than staff employees. 42. Commercial (i) Abdul Aziz Ali al Bassam, a prominent Nejdi mer chant, has sent £ 300/- in gold to be sold in Baghdad. has ,Deen sent from Tehran to Mohammad Nabi Bushin asking him to send 3 tons of pearl rnir°J? an - ( Note: - German commercial agents in ^ +£ re t 5 e War ’ e - g ‘ Herr w att,enburg, were inter ested ip mother of pearl buttons). 43.

(iv) On the 17th February c 'ir Horace Seymour and Sir : Eric Teichman passed through Bahrain on their journey by aii 1 to China, via India. His Late High ness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin 'Isa al Khalifah, K.C.IoS., C.l.I . (i) The anniversary of the accession of Shaikh Hanad v/as celebrated on the 16th February. A ceremonial parade of the State forces was held in front of the palace.Shaikh Hamad attended the parade but, as he was having trouble witl a rheumatic leg, remained seated throughout. I^also attend ed jshe parade and noticed that Shaikh Hamad looked tired and dra T ,;n. After the parade the Shaikh went to stay at his country house at Rumaitha. (ii) At about 8.30 p.m. on the I7th February Shaikh Hamad had a stroke while saying his prayers. He fell on his &amp;ide, unconscious, and never subsequently recovered consciousness. Dr.Snow (State Medical Officdr), Dr.Holmes (Residency Surgeon) and Dr.Harrison (American Mission) attended Shaikh Hamad and one of them was always with him until he died at about 13.15 p.m. on Friday, February 20th. At the time of his death only Dr.Holmes and one or two ser vants were present. Members of the family had left the house to take their midday meal. Shaikh Hamad was buried in the cemetery at Rafa' on the afternoon of the 20th February. No public notice of the funeral was given and several close relatives were un able to be present. Shaikh Hamad r s death at the age of about 70 occas ioned general and sincere grief. Not only had he proved a^true friend of the British Government but he had - always given a friendly and sympathetic hearing to all who came' to him with their troubles. Messages of condolence were received from all quarters of the £ globe. H is Highness Shaikh Salman bin Hamad al Khalifah . It was generally supposed that when Shaikh Hamad died the succession would be disputed. Many people expect ed that Shaikh Abdullah bin ^Isa, the younger of Shaikh Hamad f s two surviving brothers, would seize the power; many expected that Shaikh Salman bin Hamad, the late Ruler's eldest son, would command the greatest support: some regard ed one or other of Shaikh Salman's younger brothers as potentially successful claimants; while among the Baharina there were not a few who expected the British Government, on the death of Shaikh Hamad, to assume direct control of the Bahrain Administration. Few expected the peaceful transition from one rule to another which has in fact taken place. On the evening prior to Shaikh Hamad's death, Shaikh Abdullah paid a private visit to Shaikh Salman and promised to support him'if, in the event of Shaikh Hamad dying, he would agree to succeed his father. After discussion Shaikh Salman agreed to take his father's place- 3 - Zlfcue as Kuler of Bahrain if all the family would, support him. Shaikh ho ham ad bin ‘Isa must have been tol^ of the arrang iment, for ? immediately after Shaikh Hamad f s death, when members of the family assembled at Rumaitha, he announced that Shaikh Sal man would succeed Shaikh Hamad and asked whether anyone had any objection. The members of the family present, seeing that Shaikh Salman had the support of his two uncles, gave their unanimous consent to his succession* Meanwhile there was lying in the vaults of the Bah rain branch of the Eastern Bank a deed signed by Shaikh Hamad appointing Shaikh Salman as his successor. The contents of this deed were unknown to any member of the A1 Khalifah: nor did the A1 Khalifah khow that Shaikh Hamad had in fact appoint ed a successor. This deed was taken to Shaikh Salman on the evening of February 20th. Knowledge of its contents soon be came general and helped greatly to consolidate Shaikh Salman^s new position* On February 21st I paid condolence visits to Shaikh Salman bin Hamad, Shaikh Mohammad bin ‘Isa, Shaikh Abdullah bin ‘Isa and Shaikh Rashid bin Mohammad (father-in-law of Shaikh Hamad) * On the morning of February 22nd Shaikh Salman visited me accompanied by his two uncles and Mr*Belgrave, Adviser to •&amp;he Bahrain Government. Shaikh Salman informed me that his succession to his father had the unanimous approval of his family and subjects; and he assured me in unequivocal terms of his friendship for the British Government and of his deter mination to respect existing treaties and engagements. In the afternoon of February 22nd Shaikh Salman issued a proclamation announcing that, in conformity with the behest of his late father and with the unanimous consent of his uncles, his brothers and all his tribe, he had become the Ruler of Bahrain. The proclamation contained the following words 'I shall continue to strengthen the proved ties with the British Empire and shall always maintain its friendship”. The succession of Shaikh Salman has been accepted by all sections of the Bahrain community. Shaikhs Mohammad and Abdullah intend to b^jfpowers behind the throne”* Shaikh Salman is not popular with his younger brothers but none of them is in a position l£o dispute his authority. Other members of the Khalifah family accept Shaikh Salman as being the right and proper successor to Shaikh Hamad. The Baharina are relieved that Shaikh Salman, rather than Shaikh Mohammad or Shaikh Abdullah, has become the Ruler; and only the young bloods of the town (who are anti-British in sentiment) are disgruntled about Shaikh 3alman f s succession. As Shaikh Salman has asked Mr.Belgrave to remain as Adviser to the Bahrain Government, violent upheavals in the administration are unlikely . It is possible, however, that friction will be caused inside the Khalifah family when the thrfjhy problem of dividing Shaikh Hamad* s large estate is taken up. Shaikh Salman*s succession has been formally recognised by His Majesty r s Government and the Government of India. 25.

Adverse comments on this topic are now comparatively rare among the European community and from the more responsible elements of the Arab or Indian communitieso (iii) In Muharraq, where the building of a camp for Royal Air Force personnel is proceeding apace, there is a certain amount oi hostile criticism. The common people fear that the local pur chase of supplies by Royal Air Force personnel will put up bazaar prices. Bazaar supplies of meat and eggs (which are xor the most part imported from Iran) are limited in quantity, and it may be difficult to increase supplies to meet an increased demand. A further cause of apprehension is that the existence of a mili tary camp in the vicinity of Muharr*q will attract hostile air attack. A few people living in the village immediately adjoin ing the new Royal Air Force camp have already made preparations to move to another locality* 38. Local Affairs .

Hewitt, M.C., Defence Officer, ' Bahrain, has not returned to India as a second medical opinion was secured which indicated that his broken leg was mending satisfactorily. (ii) A military party arrived on the 31st March to give public demonstrations of the correct methods of extinguishing incendiary bombs. (iii) Reference paragraph 37 (iii) of Intelligence Summary No. 5 of 1942 in which I reported eertain local popular reactions to the building of the R.A.F. camp at Muharraq. It is of interest in this connexion to recall what happened in the last War when it was desired to land troops in Bahrain, un the 23rd October 1914 a portion of the Indian Expeditionary Force arrived in transports off Bahrain. The attitude of the Ruler, Shaikh Isa, was friendly, and preparations were made for the landing of the troops. But popular agitation was so great, and there was such intense public opposition to the proposal that the troops should come ashore, that they were compelled to remain on board for the whole of their stay of nine days. The public of a t Bahrain were convinced - and their conviction could not be shaken - that if once British or Indian troops landed on their island they would remain there in per manent occupation. The people of Bahrain are still frightened at the thought of any considerable number of military forces being stationed in the island, but their present appre hensions have a very different cause. They no longer fear permanent military occupation by the British, / /nor would they think that Bahrain's independence was being menaced. Their fear is of the consequences which they associate with the presence of troops on the island. Soldiers in Bahrain means war in Bahrain, and war in Bahrain means bombing in Bahrain. That is, at present, their chain of thought, and they think, illogically, that if there were no soldiers in Bahrain there would be no bombing j&gt;here. This is the general feeling of the common people, individuals, of course, have their personal reactions, appropriate to their social status and their standards of intelligence. Small merchants look forward to the presence of military personnel with feelings of pleasure, born of the expectation of doing profitable trade with them. Poor people dread a rise of prices consequent on an increased demand for milk, meat, eggs, vegetables,etc. The more conservative elements of the population are frightened of insults to, or interference with, their womenfolk. Others, living near the Muhar^aq aerodrome and camp, are frightened of becoming targets for enemy air attack. There are, at present, few outside the Ruling ^ Family (who could ill-afford to lose their share of the profits which accrue from the working of the Bahrain Oil Field) who realise how essential to the safety of the island is a v/ell-organized defence. 45. Dhow Traffic Reference paragraph 36 (i) of intelligence Summary No. 5 of 1942. It is reported that a launch sent from Kuwait to search for the missing boom succeeded in locating the wreckage and in salvaging from it rupees and riyals to the value of about Rs 1,15,000.46. Bahrain and Qatar Since 1937 subjects of the Shaikh of ^atar have not been allowed to visit Bahrain without obtain ing, through the Agency, the prior permission of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain. Enforcement of this prohibition was not very strict during the latter months of Shaikh Hamad’s life, but Shaikh Salman is now insisting on its rigid aoplication. Shaikh Salman is as firmly convinced as was his father of the justice of the Bahrain claim to sovereignty over Zubara, and it seems likely that hostility to the Shaikh of Qatar is likely to increase rather than diminish during Shaikh Salman's rule. 47.

Sharjah, he was enabled to make the journey in a Blenheim, which unfortunately crashed on landing. The passengers were almost unhurt but' the machine sustained both a broken back and a broken nose. The accident was due to a soft spot on the aerodrome. The Garrison Bngineer in charge of the aerodrome was also a passenger in the aircraft. (ii) Air Commodores Russell and Coleman spent some time in Bahrain on April 26th, and returned for the night of April 27th. (iii) The Commandant of the Iraq Levies and Major Hall visited Bahrain on April 26th.I 60. Royal Air Force . (i) H.H. the Shaikh of Bahrain has agreed to reserve accommodation for R.A.F* personnel in the State Hosoital, and has also approved plans for constructing additional accommodation. A number of beds in the American Mission Hospital have also been placed at the disposal of the R.A.F. (ii) Negotiations have started for the purchase from the Bahrain Government of one plot of land on Muharraq Island and for the lease of another plot. (iii) The Bahrain Government Public Works Department have for several weeks been engaged on construction work for the R.A.F. The programme of works originally proposed is almost complete 9 and further extensive works have now been taken up. (iv) Liaison between the R.A.F., the Political authorities and the Bahrain Government has been excellent 9 with the result that work has proceeded apace and conflicting interests have been reconciled with a minimum of delay or disagreement. (v) A levy service is being recruited locally for the protection of the Bahrain aerodrome. The strength will be 240 0 H.H. the Shaikh of Bahrain is lending half the arms required. 61. D efenc e. (i) A short-term but extensive programme of works has been decided upon for the protection against air attack of the Refinery and Tanks at Awali. Material not available locally is being shipped from Basra, and the Bahrain Petrol- eurn Company are already starting work in anticipation of Political approval of the programme. (ii) Thu plugging with cement of a number of oil wells has also started in accordance with a programme approved by Middle East Command. The Company await receipt of formal approval through the Political authorities. (iii) In Manama and Muharraq intense excitement was caused by the publication on April 16th in the local news paper of the following notices- 'In the present war situ ation the Islands of Bahrain have come within the zone of operations. The Government are taking steps to protect tne inhabitants and are also adopting all necessary measures in connection with air raids ..... A1 Bahrain (the name of the local newspaper) advises the town dwellers of Bahrain who are able to do so to disperse to villages and places on the seashore and especially to send away their women and children before the summer.' Force was given to the warning contained in the news paper by a simultaneous outburst of A.R.P. activity sponsored by a strong Committee whose members have been carefully chosen for ^their personality, energy and intelligence. The most obvious evidence of the new Committee’s activities is the re moval of the highly inflammable ’chitai’ matting with which the narrow streets of the bazaars are roofed. During the last few days there has been a big exodus of the well-to-do from Manama and Muharraq to summer residences (mostly barasti huts) south of Budaiya. All who can afford it are also sending away their women and children to settle ments of hastily erected huts along.the sea shore. Public / spirit— 3 —' spirit in regard to A.R.P. measures is lacking, but appeals to self-interest are evoking some response from merchants and shop-keepers 0 For the first time the people of Bahrain are now thinking of the war as something which affects themselves and their own personal security 0 Merchants, and particul arly Persian merchants, are in a state of alarm® The most undesirable element of the population - the roughs and toughs and riff-raff- are indulging in loose talk about the looting they will engage in during the darkness and confusion which follow air raids by night. A list of such persons is being compiled and they will, if necessary, be put under restraint. On the whole I consider that the stir, which^was deliberately provoked by the insertion of the notice in the local newspaper, has served a useful purpose. It has stim ulated interest in A.R.P. and has prepared the minds of the populace for possible future eventualities. 62. As sistan ce to Airc raft . (i) On Aoril 13th a Hurricane had to land at Has Tanura (Saudi Arabia)' from lack of petrol. Thanks to prompt inform ation given by the Resident Manager of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, petrol and assistance were immediately despatched from Bahrain, and the aircraft was able subsequent- to renew its flight. (ii) On the same day, Aoril 19th, information was also received from the Political Agent, Kuwait, that three Hurri canes had been forced to land near Has al Misha’ab (Saudi Arabia), and assistance from the California Arabian Standard Oil Company was asked for. Tne California Araoi-n Standard Oil Company immediately sent out a search party which succeed ed in locating the aircraft, but only after assistance had al ready arrived from Kuwait. 63. B ahrain and Qatar . Reference para 46 of Bahrein Intelligence Summary No.6 of 1942, in which it was reported^that restrictions on the entry of Qatar subjects into Bahrain were being more rigid— lv enforced by H*H* Shaikh Salman. There is reason to believe that Shaikh Salman hopes to provoke the Shaikh of Qatar into protests, which would lead to negotiations, which would, in turn, lead to reconsideration of the position of the Al Khaxi— fr in Zubara. The present hostility between^Qatar and Banrain has several unfortunate consequences, and an improvement in the relations between the two Shaikndoms would be generally welccmed. 64. The Ba.hra. i n Pet ro leum Company Lim i ted and the C ajj.f Arabian Standard Oil Company . (i) Mr.C .3. D.^vis, formerly in charge ^ of operational developments, has been appointed Acting Resident Manager, the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, and is now m full charge of the Company’s activities in Saudi Arabia. Mr. Ohliger, formerly Resident Manager, intends to leave shortly for the U.S.A. (ii) Intimation that American employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the California Arabian Standard Oil Companv could not book air passages from Bahrain without permission from the External Affairs Department of the Government of India was conveyed to the Managers of the / Companies- 4 - /X Conpnnios by thu local Superintendent 9 British Overseas Air ways Corporation. From the s'ete source they received in formation thcat the ruling had been made at the request of 'American authorities'« The first reaction seems to have been one of indignant amazement that an American citizen’s liberty of movement could be restricted in any way, and the Company’s M'&gt;n --gers have sent cables to their Principals asking for enlightenment. They are particularly anxious to know waht 'American authorities' could have prompted or connived at the step which has been taken.

(i) Reference para 47 of Intelligence Summary No.6 of 1942 in which it was reported that Flying Officer R.A.A. Bratt had assumed charge of the duties of Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain. The extent to which RrA.F. activities have recent ly developed in Bahrain has made it necessary to appoint a more senior officer to the post of Air Liaison Officer. On the 15th May Squadron Leader W.A. Chase arrived at Bah rain and has taken over charge as Air Liaison Officer Persian Gulf and Officer Commanding R.A.F. detachment, Bahrain. His duties will be many and varied, but he al ready knows Bahrain well and his appointment is welcomed both by the Agency and by the Bahrain Government. (ii) Reference para 60 (v) of Intelligence Summary No.8 of 1942 in which it was reported that a levy service was being recruited locally for the protection of the Bahrain aerodrome. Encouraging progress has been made in the execution of this scheme. Within a week of the date when sanction to the scheme was received over 1000 candidates for recruit ment had been medically examined and either accepted orrejected. By May 10th the 240 men Delected were comfortably housed in an old Palace lent for the nurpose by His Highness the Shaikh 9 were receiving rations from th~ Department, and were being vigorously d^il_ol ~^to c^ne kind of shape by N.C.O.s of the State Police« The new lorce is a mixed one, comprising as it does blacks, village Baharina, local Arabs, a few Persians and a number of mainland Arabs. The majority of the men are divers by profession, and seme difficulty was caused by the fact that many of them had received their diving advances for this season from the Nakhudas by whom they were to be employed« However, the Bahrain Government came to the rescue by repaying all such advances to the Nakhudas concerned. The local Government will recoup itself by making small monthly deductions from the pay of the recruits. Accommodation for the new force is to be construct ed by the Bahrain Government, acting on behalf of the R.A.F., on sites near the aerodrome which are now being selected. By May 3.0th all the initial steps in the raising of the two new companies of Levies had. been taken, and the Bahrain Government could do little more to develop their organization. On May 14th Colonel Hall of the Iraq Levies arrived in Bahrain accompanied by the officers and N.C.O.s who v/ill train the new force. The N,C n OoS are from the Iraq Levies. The Commanding Officer of the now force is Major J.L.Kinnaird, Royal Irish Fusiliers. He has two other British Officers under him, Captain G.S.C. Hudson of the Royal West Kent Regiment and Lieutenant A-F.S. Curtin of the Royal Ulster Rifles. These officers have all been seconded from their Regiments for special duty with the Levies. Colonel Hall, who has already seen the recruits at their drill, has expressed his satisfaction at their keenness and enthusiasm. Further training the force v/ill not be easy, but Major Hewitt, Defence Officer, will help with trained men from his Special lolice, and the Bahrain Government will continue to give such he^p as may be required from their own police. That so much has already been accomplished in so short a time is due mainly to the enthusiastic cooperation of Mr. Belgrave. The fact that a good start has been made in Bahrain is likely to help in the creation of similar forces in Dubai and Sharjah. (iii) The Manager, California Arabian Standard Oil Company, recently suggested to H.Mfs Minister, Leddah, that, if D^n.f Saud would permit such a step to be taken his Company were prepared to mark out emergency landing grounds along the coast between Kuwait and Dhahran, where so many forced landings have recently occurred. Ibn Saud gave she per mission asked for, and the California Arabian Standard Oil Company then asked the Political Agent to arrange for a Royal Air Force officer with full knowledge of service require ments to visit Bahrain as soon as possible in order to advise the Company as to the nature of Royal Air Force needs. Squadron Leader Chase has now arrived at Bahrain_and is making contact with Mr.Steineke, the Oil Company 7 s Chief Geologist, who claims to know every inch of the coastline from Dhahran to the Kuwait boundary. 71.

Reference para 62 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.8 of 1942 in which it was reported that three Hurricanes had been forced to land near Has at Misha* ab -.Saudi Arabia) on April 19th. / TheThe California Arabian Standard Oil Company were . most anxious to give any assistance that might be required of them in salvaging -the aircraft, and their offer was communicated to the Political'Agent, Kuwait. The offer was not at first accepted as a 'Royal Air Force salvage party were already.at wofk. However, it was found necessary in the end to take, advantage of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company’s offer and the. Company sent a salvage party which lost no time in. dealing with the situation with complete success. A detailed report of the salvage operations has not yet been received. . 72• Defence • (i) Reference clauses Ci) and (ii) of para 61 of Intelligence Summary No*8 of 1942. The programmes for the protection against air attack of the Refinery and Tanks at Awali and for the plugging of wells surplus to production requirements have been accorded formal approval, which was conveyed to the Bahrain Petroleum Company through the Political Agent. (ii) In Manama and Muharraq good progress is being made in the construction of slit trenches and in the promotion of other A.R.P. measures. 73. Enemy Action . oumeoning oi a sensation was causea locally Dy T ? n May 51:11 ? 'thirteen sailors from Qatar whose T&gt;° W o+f+ 1 ° eer } by a (presumably) Japanese submarine, ine statement of these sailors, who were repatriated to Qatar at the expense of the Agency; is of such interest that it is attached as an Appendix to this Summary. In anrain the sailors were hospitably treated by everyone, and were given an interview by His Highness the Shaikh, ihe incident has provoked much execration of the Japanese, whose action in sinking a small Arab trading ship is regarded as one of wanton brutality., 74. Saudi Arabia. _ , _ Owing to a local shortage of dates in and near Qatif the export of that fruit has been forbidden until next season s^crop is marketed. Meat and ghi can only be exported irom Qatif under permits, which are not granted unless the local supply exceeds local requirements. 75. Economic . (i) Supplies of foodstuffs in Bahrain, other than wheat and wheat flour, are satisfactory. There is, however, no wheat in the bazaar and, by the end of the period under review, stocks of flour had been exhausted. Bakers 1 shops began closing on May 11th, and by May 15th bread was unobtainable. It is hoped that it will be possible to obtain further stocks of flour from India in the near future. In the meantime, however, this further reminder to the public that the War is a reality which affects them personally aid individually is not unwelcome and may prove salutary. (ii) I n view of the necessity of conserving local supplies, exports to Persia can only be permitted on a restrict ed scale. At present Persian Nakhudas who bring to Bahrain their usual cargoes of fuel, livestock, vegetable ghee etc. are permitted to export in return piece goods up to one third of the value of their imports and foodstuffs up to one sixth of the value of their imports. These ratios are now being reconsidered, and it is probable that export of piecegoods will shortly be allowed up to two thirds of the value of imports. / 76.-5- 76. Local Affairs . (i) News that three of Rashid All’s colleagues in treason had been executed caused a stir in Bahrain. It was taken for granted that British influence was responsible both for the promulgation of the death sentence and for the carrying out of that sentence; and local Arabs were surprised that action so drastic should have been taken by the British. After dis cussion of the matter from every angle for several days, at every street corner and in every coffee-shop in Bahrain, the feeling that remained dominant was still one of surprise that the British could have done something so different from what popular estimate of their character expected of them. (ii) The Qadis have protested to His Highness the Shaikh against the increase of immorality in Bahrain, which they attribute largely to the presence here of so many foreigners from the West. They mentioned particularly the blatant behaviour of the prostitutes who parade along the Manama- Awali road, and the growth of liquour drinking among the Moslem community. Steps are being taken by the Bahrain Government which will, it is hoped, result in confining immoral practices to certain specified quarters which the Qadis will not, or certainly should not, visit. 77 o S muggling of gold . On May 11th a Basrah goldsmith named Ibrahim Isaac Shebbath, who had been on a visit to Bahrain where his partner Said Na’aman lives, returned to Basrah by air. On arrival at Basrah he was searched and was found to be carrying a number of gold coins and a gold belt. He was arrested by the Iraq police. Shebbath is an Iraqi Jew. The question of deporting his Bahrain partner is under consideration. Inquiries arc also being made into the circumstances in which Shebbath war able successfully to take the gold on to the Flying Boat by which he travelled from Bahrain to Basrah. 78. The Oil Companies . (i) Reference para 64 (i) of Intelligence Summary No.8 of 1942. Mr. Ohliger, formerly Resident Manager, California Arabian Standard Oil Company, left for the United States on May 15th. (ii) Industrial conscription for employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and of Petroleum Concessions Limited who are British subjects or British Protected Persons was announced on May 8th and made effective from May 9th. European and Canadian British subjects appear to have accepted the measure quietly and regard it as one which is both fair and necessary. Indians are not so happy about it, and discontent in some quarters is growing. 79. Meteorological . Maximum temperature 105°on 10th and 11th May. Minimum temperature 71°on 2nd and 3rd May. Humidity exceeded 70% on 2 days the maximum being 89% on the 8th May. May 10th and 11th were close, hot, airless days and nights which made the relaxation of sleep almost unattainable. On May 12th a strong North wind got up which cleared the at mosphere, brought relief to man and beast, and was still blow ing at the end of the fortnight under report. Sd. ~S.B. Wakefield. Political Agent, Bahrain.APPENDIX. Statement male by 13 sailors of Boom M Samhan ,, belonging to Abdullah Mahmud of Qatar. Recorded on 5th May 1942. The Boom n Samhan M left Qatar after the Id of Ramazan (October f 41) for Basrah where we shipped dates and sailed for Karachi. We stayed one day in Karachi whence we went to Khor Miyan where we landed 200 baskets of dates and then we went to Brawa where we sold all the dates to a Hindu mere v nt chant of Brawa who asked us to take the dates to Bombay and deliver them to his agent. We went to Bombay where we stayed one month after delivery of the dates to the agent of the Hindu merchant. We then left Bombay for Calicut where we shipped wood for Basrah and other articles, such as ropes, pulleys and wood, for Qatar. After staying 25 days at Calicut we left it and arrived at Goa after 9 days. We stayed 2 days at Goa where we took fresh water. About the 18th Rabi I (5th April 1942) we left Goa with the in tention of going to Muscat but after 7 days journey a subma rine appeared at sea and fired on our dhow. There was a Kuwaiti Boom belonging to Muhamad hin Jarullah with us. The Kuwaiti Boom was also fired on by the submarine. Both the Booms sunk. We managed to get ourselves into our jolly-boat and picked up the sailors of the Kuwaiti Boom as their jolly-boat was broken into pieces. No one lost his life but two sailors of the Qatari Boom were seriously and one slightly injured. We were able to reach Malwan port after remaining 5 days at sea in our jolly-boat. We left the two sick men, and two other sailors to look after them, at Malwan where we stayed 3 days. The Government officials sent us by car from Malwan to Ratnagiri where we stayed one night, and then we were put on board one of the coastal ships which took us to Bombay. After 5 days stay in Bombay we were put on board the Barpeta which arrived at Bahrain today. The Nakhuda of our Boom stayed in Bombay. The Nakhuda and sailors of the Kuwaiti Boom, with the exception of two of them who landed at Muscat, are on board the Barpeta on their way to Kuwait. We beg the High Government to help us and repatriate us to Qatar. We have lost all our belongings and we have not a single penny for our ex penses .

R oyal Air Force Levies . Reference para 70 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.9 of 1942 in which it was reported that two Companies of levies had been raised at Bahrain and that their trarining was pro gressing satisfactorily. v After inspecting the Bahrain recruits Colonel^Hall, Commandant of the new Persian Gulf Levy Force, went to Shar jah and Dubai to start recruitment for the three Companies of Levies required for the protection of the aerodromes^at those places. The Snaikhs of Sharjah and Dubai, on be^ng / assured\ assured by Colonel Hall that, the Levies were being raised for local service only and that there would be no interference with the performance of their religious rites, promised their assistanceo Within a few days of the start of recruitment over 100 levies had been enlisted &lt;&gt; Progress has not been so fast as it was at Bahrain and it is not certain yet whether the full number of men required will come forward 0 Progress in recruitment would have been much faster had there been a Political Officer at Sharjah to persuade the Shaikhs into really active cooperation. 85« Missing Aircraft . A. Boston airoraf j bound for Shaibah was last heard of 50 miles North of Bahrain at 7c30 hours GoM.T. on May 31st, Searches by land, sea and air have been organised, but so far no trace of the missing machine has been discovered. 86 o Defence. (i) Major Hills, who has been appointed D.C.R^E. Bahrain, arrived on May 1.8th. His chief duty will be supervision of the programme of works designed to protect the Refinery and Tanks at Awali against air attack. (ii) On May 30th a detachmen It is not yet known whether they at the Muhar-raq aerodrome. At p Awali. t of 40 Indian troops arrived, are to be on duty at Av/ali or scent they are quartered at 87. Economic Food Su pplies“ (i) The question of food supplies in Bahrain is causing increasing anxiety. The flour famine is merely an inconven ience to the wealthier classes-, who can supplement their diet with an additional ration of rics° / for the' poorer ^classes, however, - and especially fev the foreign element in the Bah rain population, which depends for its basic diet more on flour than on rice - the shortage of bread constitutes a domestic disaster of the first ma| nlvudo. A temporary shortage, with its salutary effects In bringing homo to'ordinary people the fact that they cannot be immunised from the economic consequen ces of world war, n&lt; without its advantage! but a chron ic bread famine, into which the temporary shortage is now developing, will lead serious political and SO( wiecsprcac. discontent which may have dal r noercu ssi ons. Local reserve of rice are also diminishing rapidly This is partly due to the increase in rice consumption v/hich has resulted from the shortage of flour, but is mainly due to the fact that for over two months the amount of rice imported from India has been negligible. Local merchants state that, since the time when the expert from India of rice, flour etc. was restricted to persons holding export permits, they have b*een unable to bring to. Bahrain the stocks which they have purchased in Karachi, Export permits are obtainable - but only on payment of large bribes to the clerical staff of the Export Control authorities 5 and Bahrain merchants are unable to afford bribes on the scale demanded out of the 10 % margin of profit which local Price Control allows to them, ^The mer chants have accordingly asked either that export permits may^ be granted by the Political Agent, Bahrain, or that the margin of profit allowed to them may be increased to 20%. The former suggestion could presumably be entertained on3.y if and when export quotas for Bahrain have been fixed; the^latter sugges tion, which involves acceptance of the proposition that the people of Bahrain should pay more for their rice or flour^ because certain Indian clerks are corrupt, will only be given consideration if the position deteriorates .-still further. (ii) C urrency s At Dubai and Charjah Indian currency / are notes-4- now at a discount of two annas in the rupee, i.e. 12^%. It is normal for notes to be at a slight discount during the diving season when there is a steady demand for rupee coins with which to pay divers their advances; but the rate of discount has never before exceeded 4%, and it is difficult to assess with certainty the relative weight of the various factors which have contributed to bring about the present unfortunate situation 0 The main factors are almost certainly five, of which two may be said to be normal and three abnormal* The normal factors are (1) the seasonal shortage of rupees caused by the advances made to divers and (2) the fact that Bedouin from the hinterland of the Trucial Coast insist on payment in rupees for the (JJuns, goats, sheep, butter etc which they bring for sale in the nubai or Sharjah markets. The abnormal fac tors are (i) the ban on the export of rupee coins from India and Bahrain (2) the general feeling of insecurity and instab ility caused by the War which leads people to prefer generally to keep, whether for hoarding or for use, a coin which has some intrinsic value rather than a note which has none (3) the fact that very large sums of money are being paid out in notes in Sharjah and Dubai by the R.A.F* The number of notes in local circulation has therefore increased enormously in rela tion to the number of coins in circulation, with the inevitable consequence that the value of notes has fallen as against the value of coins. Local merchants have raised their prices to customers who pay in notes. Locally employed staff of the British Over seas Airways Corporation are therefore refusing to accept pay ment of their wages in notes, and PUAoF* personnel or employees can legitimately complain that, as long as they are paid in notes, they are not receiving the full value of their salary. The position will deteriorate further unless immediate steps are taken to increase the proportion of coins to notes in lo cal circulation. As there are no Banks at Dubai or Sharjah, the simplest method of bringing about the dewSired result is for the R.A.Fo and the B.O.AoC. to make all payments in cash. Both the R.A.F. and the B.O*A.C. have means at their disposal to bring coins from India by air. and they are being advised to adopt this course. If they do adopt this course it is probable that in four months ? time, when the diving season comes to an end and when the influx of rupee coins has made itself felt, the balance between the value of notes and coins will be restored. 88. The Shaikh of Dubai . Shaikh Said bin Maktum, Ruler of Dubai, accompanied by his nephew, Obaid bin Jama, arrived at Bahrain on the 27th May with the professed object of condoling with the A1 Xhali- fah on the death of Shaikh Hamad and of congratulating Shaikh Salman on his succession. The nresent Shaikh of Dubai has never been regarded by the Bahrain^Shaikhs with anything but disapproval and mild contempts But during the last eighteen months, since Shaikh Mana’ of Dubai has been residing in Bahrain as a political refugee, Shaikh Said : s stock has fallen still further as Shaikh Mana 1 nas been consistently spreading malicious gossip about him. It has been interesting,therefore, to watch action and reaction during Shaikh Said ! s visit. The A1 Khalifah have criticised adversely every ac tion of Shaikh Said’s since his arrival. After Shaikh Maham- mad bin Isa had called on Shaikh Said on his launch, he com plained that he had been grossly insulted; he had not been handed coffee first, and he had been given a less honourable seat than he considered his due. Shaikh Salman states that Shaikh Said, when calling on him, entirely omitted any refer ence to Shaikh Hamad 1 s death, and he further alleges (not, I / think&lt;* 5 '- think, without seme truth) that the real object of Shaikh Said’s visit to Bahrain was to purchase motor cars and spare parts which he could not obtain anywhere else. It is true that Shaikh Said has purchased motor cars and spare parts in Bahrain 5 but he was able to do so only after the Political Agent had engaged on his behalf in a hectic diplomatic duel with Shaikh Salman, who had sent orders to his Adviser that Shaikh Said must not be allowed to make any purchases in the bazaar for export to Dubai» Shaikh Du'aij bin Hamad took clever advantage of the situation; He pleased the Political Agent by allowing his car to be sold to Shaikh Said 5 and he pleased Shaikh Salman by extorting from Shaikh Said twice the price which had been paid for the car when it was new;, Shaikh Said of Dubai intends to leave Bahrain on the 5th or 6 th June. The A1 Khalifah are too well-mannered to permit signs of their hostility to Shaikh Said to appear openly, but his visit will leave them with a good stock of material for pleasantly malicious'.anecdote. When the atmosphere has grown less electric the Political Agent proposes to remind Shaikh Salman that, in the dispute between Shaikh Said bin Maktum and Shaikh^Mana, the sympathies of Ibn Saud were wholly with Shaikh Said. 89. S mall pox and typhus . (i) Dubai has now been declared free from small pox. (ii) There is an unusually extensive outbreak of small pox in Bahrain, but deaths have been comparatively few, (iii) Three cases of typhus (one fatal) have been reported from the California Arabian Standard Oil Company camp at Dhahran. 90. Local Affairs . (i) Reference para 76 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.9 of 1942 in which it was reported that steps were being taken by the Bahrain Government to restrict the activities of pros titutes to certain specified quarters. The prostitutes of Manama resent Government inter ference with their trade, and have threatened that, if^the restrictions recently enforced are not removed, they will either (a) emigrate to Kuwait or (b) go on strike. The junior members of the A1 Khalifah are greatly worried by the situation which has now developed. (ii) A play performed by the boys of the Manama Secondary school raised Rs 2001, which has been presented to the Persian Gulf Fighter Fund. 91.- Bahrain and Qatar . Reference para 63 of Bahrain Intelligence Summary No .8 of 1942 in which it was reported that the reason for the Shaikh of Bahrain* s action in tightening up the restrictions on the entry into Bahrain of subjects of the Shaikh of Qatar might be to provide an opportunity for the re-opening of the Zubara question. It is now possible to confirm this conjecture. At an interview with the Political Agent on May 24th K.H. the Shaikh related at length the whole history of Zubara (as seen through Bahrain eyes), and enumerated the advantages which would accrue to the Shaikh of Qatar if friendly relations between the two Sheikhdoms could be resumed. The Shaikh of Bahrain is not prepared to give up his claim to sovereignty over Zubara, and it is possible that the Shaikh of Qatar / willmmammm - 6 - will still insist, as in the past, on the relinquishment of that claim as a sine qua non of any agreement. If the two Shaikhs wou^-d only agree to differ over the question of sov ereignty it looks as if there would be little difficulty in bringing about a compromise in regard to other disputed matters. The impression which the Political Agent derived from his discussion with Shaikh Salman was that he is gen uinely anxious for a settlement of the dispute, but that he is unwilling to take the first step towards a reconciliation and will, in any case, decline absolutely to renounce the claim of the A1 Khalifah to the Zubara district. a In the course of the conversation H.H. stated, and subsequently repeated, that members of the Naim and other tribes who had formerly lived in Zubara and owed allegiance to the Ruler of Bahrain were now dispersed through Saudi Arabia; but that Ibn Saud, as a gesture of sympathy, allowed goods from Bahrain to pass to them through Saudi Arabian ports free of Customs duty. When these tribesmen lived in Zubara they paid no Customs duty on goods imported from Bah rain, for Zubara was regarded as Bahrain territory; and now the exemption which was their right in Zubara has been con tinued to them in Saudi Arabia as a special privelege. 92. Persia. About conditions in Persia, many stories, which there are no means of verifying, are brought to Bahrain by the crews of Persian dhows. Among such stories recently retailed are that the Director of Customs at Hasinah was killed a short time ago by.raiding Tarakama tribesmen; and that Buir Ahmedi tribesmen recently attacked the Persian military garri son at Dilum (a small port on the Hindiyan coast), killed the officers and men stationed there, and cut the cable. 93. The Oil Companies . (i) Dr. Kennedy, formerly Medical Officer, Bahrain Pet roleum Company, went to the United States on leave a few weeks ago. He has now decided not to return to Bahrain. His place will, it is believed, be taken by Dr. Storm, formerly of the American Mission at Bahrain. (ii) Reference para 78 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.9 of 1942 in which were reported initial reactions of Oil Com pany employees to the measures of Industrial Conscription in troduced in the second week of May. It is confirmed that European and Canadian British subjects have accepted the measure with equanimity. indeed, the measure has been welcomed by the majority of the members of the European and Canadian communities who now feel (what they wanted to feel) that their work is of great importance in relation to the War. They only had one small complaint to make on a matter arising out of the terms of the Regulation, and that matter was adjusted without difficulty thanks to the cooperation of the Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Indian employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company are not happy about the Regulation. They feel that they are trapped in Bahrain, with no means of escape from the fury of the enemy should it burst upon the island. Individual cases of recalcitrance are being dealt with on their merits by the Political Agent? But a large group of employees (clerical,^ technical and artisan) have submitted a lengthy representation to the Political Resident in which they make all kinds of un reasonable demands upon the Company which employs them. Their chief complaint is that the treatment accorded to them by the Bahrain Petroleum Company is less favourable than the^treat ment accorded to their fellows by the Anglo Persian Oil Com pany, Apparently the latter Comoany have an Indian employee / onI -7- on Rs 800/- per mensem^ and Indian employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company think that they should be paid on a similar scale« ^ A copy of the representation has been forwarded to the Resident 9 but the Political Agent’s comments will only follow when he has been able to master the feelings of im patience and disgust which spontaneously rise in him whenever he studies the revealing document. (iii) Reference para 64 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.8 of 1942 in which^were reported the reactions of American employ ees to the restrictions placed on their freedom to Seave Bah rain at will. The position has now been accepted by all and sundry. The Companies have been careful not to ask for per mits to leave Bahrain for employees whom they cannot replace ? and several Americans are now being held until information is received that their reliefs have arrived at 9 or are on their way to 9 Bahrain, (iv) Over Fs 2000 was raised for War Charities by a perform ance of '-'Mr. Pym passes by’ ? staged at Awaii on the 14th and 16th May. 94. Abdul Karim M ahmud . During the period under renort were enacted further scenes in a drama on which the final curtain has not yet des cended. In the middle of February an Iraqi named Abdul Karim Mahmud landed at Dubai. The fact was reported to the British Embassy at Baghdad who intimated 9 a month later 9 that the man was wanted by the Basra police for complicity in a bomb conspir acy. For several weeks 9 while Abdul Karim was kept under close but unobtrusive surveillance at Dubai 9 the authorities concern- ed discussed ways and means of arresting the wanted man and taking him to Basrah. Several plans were proposed, only to be rejected as impracticable or impolitic. The difficulties were ^many. There was no legal sanction for formal extradition^ and informal extradition woulc constitute a breach of the sac red^ laws of Arab hospitality (for Abdul Karim was the guest of Shaikh Said bin Maktum 9 Ruler of Dubai). Means of transnort- ing Abdul Karim from Dubai to Basrah were also not readily available. ^ Eventually it became imperative to take some kind of positive action as Abdul Karim was becoming restive and had expressed his intention of leaving Dubai in the near future for Qatar and Saudi Arabia. When action was at last decided upon it was taken swiftly and effectively. On the 19th May the Commander of a small naval vessel called on the Politi cal Agent, and every aspect of the situation was discussed. At daybreak on May 21st the vessel arrived off Sharjah, and the Residency Agent went aboard. He arranged for the ship's launch to^lie off a deserted part of the beach betweem Shar jah and Hira. On receipt of a prearranged message Shaikh Rashid (son of the Ruler of Dubai) told Abdul Karim that the Residency Agent wanted to see him urgently, and he was sent off in a taxi with a driver who had been told exactly where to take his passenger. Immediately after the taxi had left, Abdul Karim's belongings were rapidly bundled together and sent after him in a second taxi. Abdul Karim found the Residency Agent waiting for him on the beach. Their meeting was dramatic in the extreme, and^Abdul Karim, when told that he was being sent back to Iraq, immediately demanded to see his host, the Shaikh of Dubai. This request was refused by the Residency Agent, who wisely added that the Shaikh had nothing to do with the affair. Abdul Karim was abusive, but not violent’ indeed, violence would have been of no avail since the Residency Agent was accompanied by two men armed with cudgels and a third armed with a rifle. Abdul Karim's final threat to the Residen cy Agent was forceful. 'After four months' he said 'I shall come to this place when your masters are no longer in existence, and I shall then han^you by the neck with hooks'. / AbdulAbdul Karim Mahmud was delivered to the sure custody of H.M.'s Navy at 10.45 a.m. on the 21st May. After two more transfers 9 from ship to ship, he was handed over to the Basrah police on the 27th May. Meteorological . Maximum temperature 106 on 31st May. Minimum temperature 75 on 20th May. Humidity exceeded 70% on 2 days the maximum being 74% on the 21st May. A North wind blew intermittently during the period under report, and the intervals of airless, humid heat were not unduly prolonged. Sd. E.B. Wakefield.

(ii) Dr. Siddiq, Indian Assistant, left for Qatar on June 1st and returned on June 6th. From May 9th to May 18th, and from May 25th to June 12th, the Political Agent had no British officer^to assist him. Between June 1st and June 6th, owing to Dr. Siddiq*s absence in Qatar, he had no assistance of any kind. The burden of work during these periods was very great. 98. Royal Visit .98. Royal Visit At 5.0 p.m. on June 6th H„R.Ho the Duke of Glouces ter arrived at Muharraq aerodrome having flown from Lydda. He was met by the Political Agent who presented to him H.H. the Shaikh of Bahrain and his two uncles. Shaikh Said bin Maktura, Ruler of Dubai, Mr. Belgrave, and the senior officers of the three Services present in Bahrain. After inspecting a Guard of Honour of the State Police His Royal Highness drove to the Agency with H.E, the Shaikh and the Political Agent. Later in the evening His Royal Highness, who was wearing the uniform of a Major General, visited H.Ho the Shaikh of Bahrain at his Manama Palace. During the visit, which lasted for some twenty minutes, the Duke of Gloucester informed His Highness that he would shortly receive a present from the British Government of two captured 105 millimetz-e Italian guns. Shaikh Salman, who was genuinely delighted at this announcement, presented His Royal Highness with some pearls and with a sword, encased in a gold scabbard, which had been in the possession of the Al^Khali fah for many generations. His Royal Highness spent the nighty at the Agency and left for Karachi the following morning. H.H. Shaikh Salman and his uncles went to the aerodrome to see him off. His Royal Highness ? visit was, in prospect, a source of pride to H.H. Shaikh Salrnan. In retrospect it has been to him a spring of unbounded exaltation and delight. The warmth of friendship with which Shaikh Salman welcomed his Royal guest was matched only by the graciousness of its response^ and the ties which bind the Ruling Family of Bahrain to the British Crov/n have been sensibly strengthened by the contact now made. 99. Other visitor s. (i) Mr. Twitchell and two other members of the United States Agricultural Mission to Saudi Arabia arrived in Bahrain on June 6th for a short visit. (ii) Mr.H.S. Bowiby, the Petroleum Department’s represent ative at Baghdad, arrived on June 8'ch. He left on June 12th having visited in the meantime the California Arabian Standard Oil Company camp on the mainland. (iii) Sir Archibald Carter passed through Bahrain on June 6th on the Westbound Flying-beat. (iv) On June 15th Sir Edward Villiers passed through Bahrain on the Eastbound Flying-boat. Sir Reginald Dorman Smith and Air Chief Marshall Sir Ludlow Hewitt passed through on the Westbound Flying-boat. 100. Royal Air Fo rce. Reference para 83 of Intelligence Summary No.10 of 1942 in which it was' reported that the new emergency landing grounds on the coast of Saudi Arabia between Dhahran and Kuwait were likely to be ready for use within a week. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company intimated on June 3rd that the marking of the landing grounds had been completed and that they were ready for inspection. On June^ 12th the Air Liaison Officer Bahrain carried out an inspection and, after landing on each of the four aerodromes, was able to report that they were fit for use. 101. Missing Ai rc raft , Reference para 85 of Bahrain Intelligence Summary No.10 of 1342 in which It was reported that a Boston aircraft bound for Shaibah had 3 ast been heard of 50 miles North of Bahrain on the morning of May 3let and that no further trace of it had been discovered, , nOn June 7th the California Arabian Standard Oil Company reported that a fisherman, who was believed to be reliable, had stated that shortly before noon on May 31st he had seen a large aeroplane disappear into the sea. In the absence of any other information there seemed no reason to deny credit to this story, and the worst fears were entertained for the safety of the crew. However, on the evening of June 10th a telegram was received from the Political Resident at Bushire intimating that a message had arrived from the crew of the missing machine to say that they were all safe though their machine was wrecked, that they were stranded at Tahiri, a place on the Persian coast 135 miles South-East of Bushire, and that they would like trans port arranged for them. This dramatic message, written on June 1st, had been taken overland to Bushire by runner. At 4.0 aom. cn dime 11th, under orders received from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, a naval vessel left for Tahiri; and later the same morning an aircraft (a Blenheim) set off with medical stores, food, clothing, cigarettes and a bundle of Persian currency notes to the value of 5000 riyals. The aircraft duly sighted the missing men and dropped the stores and money to them - dropped also a message that help was on the way and that a ship would arrive next morning to take them off. The account of their adventures given to the Political Agent by the rescued crew of the aircraft contained many fea tures of interest. They landed on a stretch of sand uncovered by the tide (which was fortunately low at the time) some four miles South-East of Barak. Having established their location on a map, they set off in the evening to walk to Kangan. At Barak they were met by the local Shaikh, Canaan Nasouri, who gave them food, bedding and shelter. They stayed the night at Barak, hoping to get donkeys to take them on their way the following morning. The next day, June 1st, having returned to the aircraft, which had been partly submerged by the sea, and having salvaged certain equipment from it, they made their way to Tahiri whose Customs Officer, Sadrnddin Suddedor, had sent donkeys to bring them there. At Tahiri they were told that it would take them a fortnight to make their way to Bushire overland (a strong North wind made travelling by sea impossible) while a messenger could complete the journey within a week. Accordingly they decided to send a messenger to Bushire while they themselves remained at Tahiri as guests of the Customs Officer, who was of a most friendly disposition and seemed genuinely anxious to extend his hospitality to them. During their enforced stay at Tahiri they were most hospitably treated. Food in the village was by no means plenti ful, but the airmen were given as much as they wanted - eggs and bread for breakfast, rice and side dishes of meat, soup, dates etc. in the middle of the day and in the evening. The Customs officer who provided this fare could not do enough for his guests, I was told. He had been educated at the American Mission School at Kirmanshah, and asserted that he was only too glad to repay to English speaking people something of the kindness he had received from them as a boy. To the very end he refused to accept any payment for himself; eventually, after the rescue party had arrived, the interpreter on the naval vessel persuaded him to accept 1500 Riyals (he would not take more) for distribution among the poor of his village. The friendliness with which the airmen were treated by every one was most marked. During the period of their stay the Shaikh of Barak and his followers were prosecuting a feud with their neigh bours to the South. Raiding parties went out almost daily, and in the course of the operations three of the Shaikh* s men were killed. The airmen examined many of the rifles used. / They-4- They were of Russian or German manufacture, all of them old. The newest rifle they saw was a German Mauser made in 1917. They also noticed a steady trickle of travellers making their way North, sometimes in ones and twos, sometimes a dozen or fifteen at a time. They were told that these were men making their way to Abadan in search of work. Sometimes crowded dhows would also be seen hugging the coast and making their way North; but generally the weather made sea travel impracticable. The two things which made the deepest impression on the airmen were (i) the extraordinarily friendly way in which everyone, and especially the Customs Officer at Tahiri, treat ed them, and (ii; the remarkable accuracy with which the Blen heim dropped their bundles of food etc., one after another, practically at their feet. 102. Defence. Many thousands of tons of coral are being provided^ by local labour every month, partly for P.A.D. works at Awali and partly for the soling of a large area of soft ground which divides the Civil from the R.A.F. aerodrome at Muharraq. The coral is cut from the sea shore when the tide is low, is load ed into small boats and is dumped at the nearest convenient pier or jetty. The progress of the works at Awali and Miharraq is limited not by the supply of coral available, which is in exhaustible, nor by shortage of labour, of which there is plenty, but by the number of small boats available for use in transporting the coral from sea to land. A 'trial order' has now been received from Basrah for 10,000 tons of coral to be delivered within a month. Acceptance of the order would give much-needed local employment; but it is doubtful whether there is a sufficient number of small boats available to enable so large a requisition to be fulfilled without interfering with the progress of local works. The question is being given careful thought. 103. Economic . (i) Food Supplies . Reference para 87 (i) of Intelligence Summary No.10 of 1942 in which it was reported that the question of food supplies in Bahrain was causing increasing anxiety, and that the temporary shortage of flour was developing into a chronic bread famine. No wheat or flour was imported into Bahrain during the period under review in spite of the fact that licences for the export of flour from India had been granted to Bahrain merchants. In fact, four successive weeks have passed without a single bag of flour arriving at Bahrain. The position has now become really serious. Every day crowds demonstrate out side the Customs House; Indian employees of the Bahrain Pet roleum Company are becoming disaffected and complain that, if they are compelled to remain in Bahrain, at least provision should be made to feed them; and the feelings of the local populace are exacerbated beyond measure when, seeing bags off-loaded from ships calling at Bahrain, they discover that they are filled with pepper or chillis, cardamom or turmeric, copra or nuts or ginger - with everything, in fact, except the flour which is so desperately needed. The Shaikh of Bah rain is pressing the Political Agent hard to alter the basis of price control in such a manner as to allow local merchants double their present margin of profit, in order that they can obtain by bribery at Karachi the facilities which are denied to those who, for whatever reasons, are compelled^to follow the path of rectitude. The Political Agent r s resistance to the Shaikh's pressure is weakening, as he cannot refute the / propositionproposition that some wheat in Bahrain at a high price is better than none at any price. The Bahrain Petroleum Company, realising that their operations are likely to be adversely affected if their em ployees cannot obtain essential foodstuffs, have offered to place all surplus space on their tankers at the disposal of the Bahrain Government for the transport of foodstuffs. The offer has been gratefully accepted. (ii) Currency . Reference para 87 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.10 of 1942 in which it was reported that Indian currency notes at Dubai and Sharjah were at a discount of two annas in the rupee. Early in the period under report the value of currency notes depreciated still further, and they were quoted at a discount of four annas in the rupee. No news of more recent developments has yet been received. 104. The Shaikh of Dubai . Reference para 88 of Intelligence Summary No.10 of 1942 in which an account was given of the somewhat cold welcome accorded by the A1 Khalifah to Shaikh Said bin Maktum, Ruler of Dubai, on his visit to Bahrain. Shaikh Said left Bahrain by launch for Qatar on^June 14th. The Political Agent was glad to see the last of him, not on any personal grounds, but because his presence in Bah rain was a fertile source of embarrassment to everyone con cerned. After news of the Duke of Gloucester’s proposed visit to Bahrain had been received, little time elapsed before H.H. Shaikh Salman expressed very forcibly to the Adviser the opinion that Shaikh Said should not be allowed to push himself into the picture 6 , in Dubai he could do what he liked, but in Bahrain he was a visitor and ought to take a back seat. Shortly after this had been retailed to the Political Agent,^ that unfortunate officer received a written request from Shaikh Said asking that he might be informed of the time of the Duke of Gloucester’s arrival in order that he might pay his respects to him. Whatever course the Political Agent took seemed likely to cause offence to one of the two Shaikhs though it was obviously undesirable that the Royal visit should be the occasion of heart-burning to either of them. Eventually the Political Agent approached Shaikh Salman with a request for a little private advices The Shaikh of Dubai was only a visitor to Bahrain but naturally would like an opportunity of being presented to the Duke? would His Highness prefer that Shaikh Said should be presented to the Duke on the latter’s arrival at the aerodrome, or that he should be granted a private audience with the Duke at the Agency later in the day? Shaikh Salman, full of apprehension lest the latter^alternative should be adopted, earnestly advocated adoption of the former suggestion, and himself volunteered to take Shaikh Said with him to the aerodrome. So the difficulty was resolved with satisfaction to all concerned. 105• Small Pox • Reference para 89 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.10 of 1942 in which it was reported that there had been an un usually extensive outbreak^ of smallpox in Bahrain. 20,000 people in the island have been vaccinated. Vaccination has been compulsory in respect of masters and boys of Government schools, personnel of Government offices, barbers bakers and coffee-shop owners, Police and Defence personnel, / andand persons entering or leaving the island. Facilities at the quarantine centre on Muharraq Island have been improved and this institution is now being run smoothly and efficiently by the Agency doctor. The State Medical Department take the view that the increase in the incidence of smallpox this year is,apparent rather than real. They say that the epidemic has probably been, in fact, only of normal proportions but that it seems to have been more extensive because so many cases have been exposed and treated. In the past many cases were concealed, and people died from smallpox without the death being reported or its cause diagnosed. 106. Local Affairs . (i) Reference para 90 (i) of Intelligence Summary No.10 of 1942 in which it was reported that the prostitutes of Manama had threatened either to emigrate to Kuwait or to go on strike. In the end they adopted the latter alternative. But idleness is irksome to people who love their work, and already the ranks of blacklegs are nightly receiving fresh recruits. (ii) In order to provide relief for the poor of Bahrain a committee of Arabs was recently formed under the presidency of Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa to collect money in Manama and Muharraq. About Rs 11,000/- has already been collected from Arabs, Sunni Persians and Indians. No collections were made from the Shia community nor were Shias invited to join the committee. This exclusion of the Shias was insisted on by the Fakhroo family, who gave generously to the fund, and by Khaleel Kanoo, who was active in collecting money but less active in giving it. The Shias have felt bitterly their exclusion from participation in this philanthropic undertaking and complain that this is the first occasion for many years that a deliberate and definite distinction has been made bet ween Shias and other Arabs. They asked the Adviser whether there was any objection to their organising similar measures among their own community. They were told that there was no objection and that in the matter of affording help the^Bahrain Government would treat Sunnis and Shias alike. The^Shias have now collected some Rs 7,000/- and both communities are en deavouring to collect more subscriptions. The stimulus to their activities has become political and communal jealousy rather than philanthropy. The Shias were so incensed at the attitude adopted towards them by the Sunni^Community that they threatened to resign en bloc from all public bodies. It is un likely, however, that they will carry out their threat. It may be added that there is a considerable amount of destitution in Bahrain. The date crop is not yet ripe and bread is unobtainable so the poorest members of the community have difficulty in avoiding starvation. 107. Public Relations . On the 3rd June Mr. Bertram Thomas, Public Relations Officer, gave a most successful evening party for the Shaikh of Dubai. Guests included the Political Agent and leading members of the mercantile community. After dinner war films were shown. These included many pictures^of heavy bombers and the factories where they are made. Since news of the R.A.F.’s gigantic raids on Essen and Cologne had just been received the pictures shown aroused the greatest interest. 108. Bahrain Government . t It 0 ' On June i^h Dr Doeg arrived in Bahrain. She has been appointed Lady Medical Officer to the Bahrain Government-7- 109. The Oil Companies . (i) Direct radio telephonic communication between Bahrain and Dhahran began on the 3.1th June. Institution of the service was delayed for nearly a month while the renewed sanction of the Saudi Arabian Government was obtained. (ii) Since May 2nd the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s daily production of oil has been reduced from 18,000 to 15,000 barrels per day. The reason for the reduction is not known. (iii) Mr. Hodstrom, the California Arabian Standard^Oil Company’s popular and efficient representative in Bahrain,^has handed over charge of his duties to Mr .Reynolds prior to his departure to the United States on vacation. 110. Alarms and Excursio ns, (i) Wild rumours were circulated in European^circles as the result of a casual remark by the pilot of an aircraft visiting Bahrain that he had seen off Sitra what appeared to be a submarine s The ^submarine 1 ’ turned out to be the tanker 'Caltex II'. (ii) Considerable local excitement was caused by the dis covery at Budaiya of what was believed to be a bomb. Investi gation showed the bomb to be a smoke float released by some passing aircraft. A smoke floa'c. undoubtedly resembles a bomb in shape and appearance but in weight it is, of course, very different. 111. M eteorological . Maximum temperature 93,7 ^ on 15th June. Minimum temperature 75.0 on 15th June. Humidity exceeded 70% on 2 days the maximum being 80% on 14th June. A North wind blew throughout most of the period under report. Towards the end of the period, however, the wind died away completely, leaving in its place a hot and humid vacuum. Sd. EoB. Wakefield. Political Agent, Bahrain. ■wtmmmmmm s||t* &lt;S&gt; CONFIDENTIAL 49/T7f c/o Naval Officer-in-Charge, BASRAH. 2nd. June 1942 My dear Wakefield, Very many thanks indeed for your D.0 . No. C.728 and the most interesting notes that accompanied it. I have shown them to the S.N.O. who was extremely pleased. I only wish other people would play so well. notes on the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast and Qatar. As a matter of fact, I do want them rather 'badly. I have some notes which Packer Prepared ab»out a year ago and which he is supposed to 'be bringing up to date. possibility of the enemy having established bases that might be used by submarines operating in the Gulf. It is possible that some out of the way and little known inlets may be equipped for this purpose with stocks of oil and other stores. If you know of any places that could be used for this purpose will you please let me have details so that they can be investigated. Any place that has been specially visited by enemy nationals in peacetime would be of interest, particularly if no good reason for the visits can be given. In your last para, you offer to give me similar A point that is also being considered now is the Many thanks again for the trouble you have taken. Yours sincerely • 9 E.B. Wakefield Esq, The Agency, BAHREIN.Confidential D,0.No,C/922 . The Agency, Bahrain, the 28th June 1942. Will you please refer to your confidential demi-official letter No.49/279 dated 2nd June 1942. 2 . I am overwhelmed with work at the moment, but will let you have some notes on the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast and Qatar as aoon as I have leisure to prepare them. 3* In regard to the possibility of the enemy having stocks of oil or other stores hidden along the shores of the Gulfs I know nothing about the Persian coast, but can speak with some knowledge of conditions on the Arab side. Along the coast between Kuwait and Qatar there is no possibility of any such cache, as the employees of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company are con tinually traversing the area. There is also no possibility on the Qatar coast, all parts of which are visited by employees of Packer*s Company. The coast between Dohah and Abu Dhabi is less frequented, and stores might be buried near some inlet. I do not think, however, that the presence of s tores in that part of the worl could possibly be kept a secret for more than a very short space of time, and the chances, in practice, of stocks being concealed in that area are nil. From Abu Dhabi to Has al Khaimah the chances of a cache are nil. From Ras al Khaimah to Has Musandam, and from Ras Musandam South to Fujairah and Kalba the practical possibilities of stores being hidden are rather greater. Road communications in that area are non-existent, and some creeks or inlets would not normally be visited by anyone at all. But political conditions / in Lieutenant-Commander G.W. Manson R.N., Staff Officer (Intelligence), C/o C.I.C.I., Basra.in that area render it most unlikely that anything could be stored anywhere for long with any degree of security. There are no secrets along that coast; every man’s neighbour is his enemy, and I do not think for one moment that stores could have been landed and hidden without news of it leaking out long ere now. ■'he territory South of Kalba comes under the Political Agent, l&amp;iscat, and I know nothing about it. 4. About the islands I cannot speak with certainty. Most of them are visited by dhows, especially those with water. But normally they are uninhabited,, and they would, in practice, provide a far better hiding place for stocks or stores than any coastal creek. In fact, I would go so far as to say that stores could not be successfully concealed by an enemy at any point on the Arab coast from Kuwait to Kalba; though such storage on an island would not be impracticable. Yours sincerely,O V u_ c^ b \- The He&amp;ideEkcy t Bushire, the 16th June, 1942* D.O.K0.584-S.

Intelligence Summary of the Political Agent, Bahrain, for No.12 of 1942 . the period 16th to 30th June 1942. 112. Shipping . See Appendix to this Summary. 113. Movements of Officials . The Political Agent and Captain Dixon circumnavigated Bahrain Island on June 19th. The journey, which was performed in the Bahrain Government’s Police launch, took just over twelve hours. 114. Notable Visitors. Generals Brereton, Alexander and Adler arrived in Bahrain by air from India on June 26th and left in a Westerly direction on June 27th. Their night’s stay in Bahrain was involuntary, being caused by weather conditions. 115. Royal Air Force Levies. Reference para 84 of Intelligence Summary No.10 of 1942 in which doubt was expressed whether the full number of recruits required at Dubai and Sharjah would be forthcoming. At Dubai 104 of the 120 men required have been en listed and the O.C. Levies expects to recruit the balance within a week or ten days. At Sharjah only 52 of the 240 men required have been enlisted, and it will obviously be necessary to open the ranks of the Sharjah Levies to recruits from Dubai. 116. Defence . During the period under report military forces in Bahrain received a very considerable accession to their strength. The Bahrain Government have been consistently helpful in placing at the disposal of the various Services land, build ings etc. required for Defence purposes. 117. Air Raid Alarm . At about 2.15 p.m. on June 21st a 'Red* Air Raid warning was received from Basrah. The Bahrain Petroleum Company was immediately informed, and precautionary measures were taken. The ’All Clear' was received half an hour later. In the meantime, however, unnecessary confusion had been caused owing to the receipt by the Naval Base of a telephone message, sent by an unknown person at Awali, to the effect that a bomb had been dropped on the Refinery. The author of this message has not been traced, and it cannot therefore be ascertained whether it was due to deliberate knavery, to a perverted sense of humour, or merely to hysteria. Regarded as an exercise, the Air Raid warning was useful in that it brought to notice a number of imperfections in existing A.R.P. arrangements. Bazaar speculation about the reason for the warning was as varied and imaginative as one would expect in Bahraini but it is of interest that gossips and rumour-mongers unanimously placed the danger in the East, from the Japanese, rather than in the North or West, from the Germans. 118. Economic . TIT Food Supplies . Reference para 103 (i) of Intelligence Summary No.11 of 1942 in which it was reported that the position arising out / ofof the bread famine had become really serious. Public unrest was allayed by two measures - (i) The margin of profit allowed to merchants by the Pood Controller on imports of rice and flour was doubled. Merchants immediate ly placed large orders with their Agents in India for the supply of these commodities; and the news that these orders had been placed gave the public confidence that supplies of flour would soon arrive in Bahrain. (ii) A system of Card rationing for rice, flour and sugar was introduced. The introduction of rationing for flour suggested, more forcibly than any vague assurances, that flour would soon be available again in the market. By the 20th June discontent among the Indian employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company at their alleged ’starvation* was becoming dangerously unanimous. The Company, therefore, arranged for the issue of bread to any of their Indian employ ees wishing to purchase it. The price was reasonable, but the quantity which any individual was permitted to buy was strictly limited. The Company only had a small amount of flour avail able - the amount required for consumption by Staff Personnel and their families over a period of six months - but accepted the assurance given by the Political Agent that it would be un necessary for them to continue the concession for more than ten days or a fortnight. Before the end of the period under report 715 bags of wheat flour (representing rather less than a fortnight* s normal consumption) had been imported into Bahrain, and the flour situation became temporarily easier. The six weeks’ flour famine caused real distress among the poorest members of the^ community, Indians also felt the lack of flour, though their want was not as sharp as the voices which they raised in pro test. H.H. the Shaikh, in discussing the situation with the Political Agent, referred, shrewdly enough, to the thirst which a traveller feels when he knows that water is short. (ii) Currency . ^ Reference para 103 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.11 of 1942 in which it was reported that in the first week of June currency notes had depreciated so much at Dubai and Sharjah that they were quoted at a discount of four annas in the rupee. Currency notes at Dubai and Sharjah are still at a discount, but only of one anna in the rupee. The improvement^ in the situation is reported to be due to the arrival in Dubai of a consignment of Rs 40,000 in cash, imported by a Hindu mer chant, Another Rs 50,000 is said to be on its way to Dubai from India. 119. Slave Traff ic. Reports have been received from various sources that slaves are being imported into Qatar from the Persian coast for sale to Nejdi slave traffickers. H.H. the Shaikh (who is an unreliable informant where Qatar affairs are concerned) told the Political Agent that Persian girls could be bought in Qatar for as little as Rs 15 or 20. It is known, of course, that whole families on the Persian Coast are in a state of destitu tions and the story goes that the Nakhodas of Persian dhows, with plausible tales of the good conditions existing on the Arab side of the Gulf, persuade parents to send their children in their care to the land of plenty across the sea. V/hen these parties of children and young adults arrive on the Arab side of the Gulf, they are sold like sheep or goats to the highest bidder. After making due allowance for the inevitable element / ofof exaggeration, there remains a sufficient corpus of evidence to suggest that Dohah, the capital of Qatar, is being, or at least has been, used as an entrepot in this sickening traffic. 120. The Shaikh of Fujairah . Shaikh Mohammad bin Hamad al Sharqi, Shaikh of Fujai rah, arrived at Bahrain on the 27th June and called on the Political .Agent on the 29th, He gave expression to strong pro-British sentiments, and declared his readiness to assist the British Government in any and every way open to him. The Political Agent, in thanking him for these sentiments, referred with appreciation to the Shaikh* s action in making Mirza bin Barkat and his family remove themselves from his territory. Mirza bin Barkat, it will be recalled, is the freebooter and slave trader whose piracies caused so much alarm last winter among the owners of sea-going dhows, both Arab and Persian. The Shaikh of Fujairah appears to be a young man of parts, lively and with a quick intelligence. 121. Supplies for Saudi Arabia . (i) Large shipments of food supplies, marked ’U.K.C.C.’ end consigned to Ras Tanura, have been received by Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Company, Bahrain. Cii) Saudi Arabian Government officials recently told the Personnel Manager of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company that the Saudi Arabian Government had been given an opportunity a short time ago of buying large supplies or rice from Egypt. The offer had been refused as adequate supplies of rice were already being obtained from India and, in any case, people in Saudi Arabia did not like Egyptian rice. 122. Smuggling of Arms . (D Bahrain 0 From time to time reports are received that arms have been, or are going to be, smuggled out of Bahrain. No seizures have yet been made though suspected dhows have been searched after they have cleared the harbour and have set sail for the Persian coast. (it) Shar.iah . A seizure of ten smuggled rifles was recently made at Sharjah. All the rifles were old. The smugglers are also alleged to have committed two murders in the course of an adventurous career extending over the last two months, the details of which are still under investigation. 123♦ Smuggling of Gold . (i) On the 17th June the Political Agent received informa tion from a private source that gold had been smuggled out of Bahrain on S.S. Barpeta bound for Kuwait and Basrah. The author ities st those ports were requested to take special preventive steps^ and on the 20th June a telegram was received from the Political Agent, Kuwait, reporting that 200 sovereigns had been found on a passenger alighting there. The gold was contained in a package which showed the consignor to be Haji Mohammed Tahir Khunji, a well-known Bahrain merchant of Persian nation ality. (ii) On the 23rd June a launch bound for Kuwait, on which a number of Kuwaiti merchants were travelling, was intercepted by the Bahrain Police off Jedda Island and thoroughly searched. No gold was found, but the passengers (who included a suspicious looking ’guide* from the Hedjaz) were detained as they were carrying uncensored letters. The most interesting item of the launch’s cargo was a sack contain ing Rs 50,000 in currency notes.124. The Oil Companies. (i) Refarence para 109 (i) of Intelligence Summary No.11 of 1942 in which it was reported that direct radio telephonic communication between Bahrain and Dhahran began on the 11th June. The usefulness to the Services of this &amp;f this connec tion was given convincing demonstration when, on the 16th June, a Royal Air Force machine was compelled to make a forced land ing on Tarut Island (South of Ras Tanura). Owing to the facili ties now available for direct communication with the mainland, help was immediately forthcoming. (ii) Reference para 109 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.11 of 1942 in which it was reported that the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s production of oil had been reduced from 18,000 to 15,000 barrels per day. By the end of the period underi report nine of the fif teen separate units comprised in the Refinery had been shut down, and the Company propose, during the next fortnight, to dispense with the services of no less than 400 Bahraini employees. At the end of a month, unless the position improves in the mean time, another 200 Bahraini employees will be discharged. The reasons put forward by the Company for the partial closure of the Refinery are being separately reported. 125. Local Affairs . (i) Reference para 106 (i) of Intelligence Summary No.il of 1942. The prostitutes’ strike is now over, and Bahrainis have resumed their normal social activities. (ii) Reference para 106(ii) of Intelligence Summary No.11 of 1942 in which an account was given of the jealous rivalry between Shias and Sunnia in making collections for their res pective ”Relief of the Poor” Funds. The original Arab Committee, which invited subscrip tions only from Arabs, Sunni Persians and Indians, has now collected Fs 22,000. The Baharina and Shia Persians have collected some Rs 10,000. Members of the A1 Khalifah have sub scribed to both Funds, and so also has the Bahrain Petroleum Company - the latter to the extent of Rs 1,500/-. 126. Suicide. On June 26th a Danish officer, an Engineer, committed suicide on board a Cable ship lying off Bahrain. The Assistant Political Agent held an inquest on the following day, after which the corpse was buried at sea. The cause of death is not definitely known, but may well have been due to climatic con ditions . 127. Meteorological . Maximum temperature 103.4^ on 19th June Minimum temperature 79.0° on 16th and 17th June. Humidity exceeded 70% on four days, the maximum being 82% on 25th June. During the period under report the Bahrain climate more than justified the reputation accorded to it by a former Political Agent who described it as ’’One of the foulest climates in the world”. Sd. E.B. Wakefield. Political Agent, Bahrain.SECRET. Intelligence Summary of tne Political Agent, Bahrain, for 'j; No.13 of 1942. the period 1st to 15th JUly !942 o 128. Shippin g. See Appendix to this Summary. 129. Movements of Officials . The Political Agent left Bahrain for Qatar in the early morning of July 2nd and returned in the afternoon of July 4th. 130. Visitors . (i) Sir Edward Benthall, Colonel Reynolds and Major C.A.G. Savidge arrived in Bahrain on July 10th and stayed n igh at the Agency. They left for India the following day. (ii) On July 11th Sir Jeremy Raisman and Sir Theodore • Gregory passed through Bahrain on the Westbound flying boa . (iii) During the period under report a number of military and R.A.F. officers visited Bahrain. 131. Roval Air Force . The Shaikh- of Qatar has given his verbal, assent-to the location on the Qatar coast of a number of wireless obser vation units. The Political Agent declined to entertain the Shaikh’s suggestion that the R.A.F. personnel manning these -_pa»t&amp; .shauld wear Arab dress. 132. Defence . This island is not yet an the period under report there were to the strength of its defences. armed ^fortress, but during further welcome additions Military dispositions have been separately reported. 133. Economic f-H Food Supplies. Supplies of wheat-flour, sufficients^ to meet current rl^Tirements, have now been received in Bahrain, and there is at the moment no shortage of any essen i.. stuffs. The picking of the date crop is beginning. (ii) War Allowances . On the 5th July the Bahrain Govern- ment announced the'grant of a special '’.Jar A P owa ^®. their employees in receipt of monthly pay not exceedi -&lt;? 3 »_ + , u Q q! i p has been granted because of the rise in fo 8 l of It .ill not bo paid to dov.rnmmt servants, such as the police, who 1 re ° el Y® ^ e ® f °^ a °p r . 3 ctical' The allowance is on a sliding scale designed to give pracii recognition ?o the fact that lower paid employees spend a gte^er proportion of their pay on essential foodstuffs than do higher paid employees. Persons in r ® c ®3;P£ ° Jnas in the Fs 50/- p.m. are being given an allowance t 0 iid ruoee of their pay', persons whose pay is between b 50 ana . Rc n n receive an allowance of one anna six pies i rupee; 'and petlonl whosepay is between Fs 100 and Fsl50 p.m. get an allowance of one anna in the rupee. (ill) topsail he beginning of June the price of sovereigns in Bahrain was Fs 52/-. During the month the P r £°® fn^ac^ad^ren 1 ?' tver ?.D. 5, the price of sovereigns inBahrain Jur^d to Es 65. By July 7th the price had dool.n nocl to Rs 60«and, at the &amp;ivi of the period undox* ropor't^ the price was fairly steady at Rs 59-60. The price of sovereigns appears to fluctuate with the ebb and flow of Allied military fortunes; when the Allies suffer reverses, the price of sovereigns rises; when fortune smiles on the Allied arms, the sovereign at once declines in value. (b) Rupee notes to the value of several lakhs of rupees have been exported from Bahrain to Kuwait in recent weeks. Brokers from Kuwait arrive with rupee drafts on Bah rain, which are met by payment in rupee notes. These notes are then taken by dhow to Kuwait, where they are tendered in payment of further rupee drafts on Bahrain. The profit on this transaction is believed to be about 1.5%. It is under stood in Bahrain that the Kuwait Bank obtains most of its requirements of rupee notes from these brokers. The Bahrain Bank imports currency notes from India by air, and by this means avoids the heavy insurance charges levied on notes carried by British India Steam Navigation Company steamer^ The Kuwait Bank, however, cannot import notes direct by air, and it is cheaper for them to buy in the local market notes which have come from Bahrain than to obtain their requirements by sea from India. Kuwaiti brokers are also operating in another manner. They arrive here with rupee drafts on Bahrain, which are duly cashed. With the proceeds are purchased drafts on Qatif, which are used for the purchase of Saudi Riyals at a premium of Rs 50-60 per thousand Riyals. These Saudi Riyals are then sent by dhow to Kuwait where they are sold to Iraqi merchants at a premium of 2 annas per Saudi Riyal, or Rsl25 per thousand Saudi Riyals. With the proceeds of the sale of these Saudi Riyals fresh rupee drafts on Bahrain are obtained, and the circle of profit begins again. In so far as the Saudi Riyals finding their way to Kuwait are used by Iraqi merchants for the purchase from Bedouin of camels, sheep, goats, skins etc., this commerce is legitimate and useful. It is not unlikely, however, that many of the Riyals which reach Iraqi hands via Bahrain and Kuwait are used for the purchase of gold* in res pect of which there appears to be an inexhaustible supply in Saudi Arabia and an insatiable demand in Iraq. 134. The Shaikh of Fujairah . Reference para 120 of Intelligence Summary No.12 of 1942 in which it was reported that Shaikh Mohammad bin Hamad al Sharqi, Shaikh of Fujairah, had arrived at Bahrain on June 27th. After a short stay in Bahrain as the guest of H.H. Shaikh Salman, the Shaikh of Fujairah left for the mainland eh route to Riyadh where he proposes to see Ibn Saud. 135. Bahrain and Qatar . Reference para 91 of Intelligence Summary No.10 of 1942 in which some account was given of H.H. the Shaikh of Bahrain’s attitude towards Qatar. During his recent visit to Dohah the'Political Agent raised tentatively with the Shaikh of Qatar the question of relations with Bahrain. Though the Political Agent made an oblique approach to the subject, the Shaikh’s reaction was violent in the extreme. He behaved as would a cask of gun powder to which the flame of a match is brought gradually closer; however gentle and insensible the approach of the match, the moment contact is made an explosion occurs. Thus the Shaikh of Qatar exploded. He could not understand, he said, why the Shaikhs of Bahrain were carrying on so virulent / andand unremitting a campaign of hate against him, He had done nothing, he asserted, to provoke their enmity, and he could not understand why they took every opportunity of insulting him and persecuting his subjects. When the Political Agent murmured the word 'Zubara', the volcanic old Shaikh erupted again. What had Zubara to do with Bahrain, or Bahrain with Zubara, he asked: Could he not deal with his tribesmen in his own way, without interference from outsiders? When the stream of invective lava had somewhat subsided, it was possible to * ascertain the immediate cause of the old man's vehemence. He had recently had occasion to buy some sugar. At Bahrain, which is a closed market to him, the price is fis 45/- per bag, but at Dubai, whence he now obtains his supplies, the price is fis 80/- per bag. The Shaikh loves money for its own sake, and the fact that the Bahrain embargo on exports to Qatar causes him financial loss makes him resentful and bitter. Long after the occurrence of the main explosion, and when the~con- versation had passed to quite other topics, the Shaikh still spluttered and muttered whenever there passed through his mind some momentary thought of the outrage caused to his pocket by the actions of the irredentist A1 Khalifah. 136. The Oil Companies . (i) Reference para 124 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.12 of 1942 in which a very considerable decrease in the activities of the Bahrain Petroleum Company was reported. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company have similarly been compelled to reduce production, and have dis charged twenty of their Staff Employees. The question of how they are to return these employees to the U.S.A. is causing the Company some difficulty. They hope to obtain the use of a Pan American Airways machine as space is not available in B.O.A.C. aircraft. (ii) The readiness of the Bahrain Petroleum Company to cooperate in matters connected with the War is illustratedby the following incident. On the evening of the 8th July a naval vessel arrived off Bahrain with a broken fuel pump. She could not proceed on her way without the pump being repaired - and repairs could only be carried out by experts in a well- equipped workshop. On the morning of July 9th the defective sections of the pump were taken to Awali, and the Company's assistance was invoked. Mr. Ward Anderson gave orders for the job to be taken in hand at once. The pump was repaired with out delay, and the ship was enabled to proceed on her way the same afternoon. t (iii) Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. are closing down their operations in Qatar pending the return of more stable world conditions. It is hoped to find employment for their skilled personnel with other Oil Companies in India or the Middle East. A skeleton staff will be retained at Bahrain. 137. Broadcasting . On the evening of Thursday, July 2nd, Bari (Italy) announced in their Arabic broadcast that the Duke of Gloucester, on his recent visit to Bahrain, had promised to give the Shaikh two Italian guns from Libya. The announcer stated that the guns had not yet arrived, and added that, at the moment, the guns would be more useful to the British in Libya than in Bahrain. 138. Pearls . Two months of the pearling season have now passed, and it is possible to give a brief review of the conditions of the industry. The number of pearling dhows which have gone out is slightly larger than last year. The price of pearls in Bahrain is about 15% higher than it was at the / corresponding-4- correspondiAg period of !La«t year, but is lower than the price at the end of last season. The number of pearls brought in so far is small, as weather conditions have been unfavourable and the smaller dhows have spent much of the last two months taking shelter from the unusually high winds which have swept down the Gulf from time to time. Profits are expected to be below average as the greatly increased cost of foodstuffs has added enormously to the expense of maintaining the crews of pearlers. The demand for pearls from India is said to be quite good, but not good enough to make up for the loss of other markets. Generally speaking, the current pearling season seems likely to be poor but not as bad as that of 1940. 139. Local Affairs . :^\ry The Adviser to the Bahrain Government was recently called upon to exercise his judicial ingenuity in a case which excited a good deal of local interest. Two ladies live in neighbouring houses; but their feelings have for long been anything but neighbourly. The younger lady, Miriam, has a husband, but has parted from him. The elder lady, Ayesha, is a widow, and is said to be jealous of Miriam. Ayesha knew that the law inflicts penalties on those who openly abuse their fellows, so she devised an ihdirect method of insulting her neighbour. When her nanny-fgdat gave birth to a kid, she christened the offspring ’’Miriam'* And at all hours of the day, and sometimes at nighty she would hurl abuse at^Miriam. No term of imprecation was too indecent, no objurgation too obscene, to be launched at the innocent scapekid; and the name of Miriam, never without abusive epithets attached, echoed ceaselessly round the quarter where the two ladies lived. Miriam, the lady, took offence at Ayesha’s conduct , and sought redress in the court of the Adviser• The Politi cal Agent would like to report that the Adviser settled the case as theatrically as Solomon would have done. In fact, however, the Adviser took the sensible if non-dramatie course of arranging a compromise thfough friends of^the two ladies. Now the kid is no longer the targef of vicarious abuse, and the ladies have resolved their differences. 140. Meteorological . Maximum temperature 102.1° on 6th July. Minimum temperature 81.2° on 14th July. Humidity exceeded 70% on 3 days, the maximum being 73% on the 7th and 14th July. Until nearly the end of the^period under report,a , North Wind blew with greater or less intensity, and the fortnight of July proved to be climatically less intolerable than any similar period sirice April. Sd. E*B. Wakefield. Political Agent, Bahrain.% Naval Officer in Charge, Basra* 12/7/42 Dear Wakefield, Very many thanks for your D.O. 0/ 922 and the trouble you have taken.The information confirms what I thought the position to be and is most useful. I will be very glad of your note on the Trucial Sheikhs but it is not a matter of urgency and can quite well be kept waiting until you are a bit less busy. .c*4&gt;)L&gt;0 I was interested in Para 124 of your summary No. 12 and would be grate ful for a copy of the report on the rea sons for the closure of the oil wells. Do you think this is likely to hawe any adverse effect on the security position in so far as labour is concerned? Yours sincerely Lt. Comdr-R.N. E.B. Wakefield Esq. Bahrein.SECRET The Agency, D.O.No .C/1104 . Bahrain, the 23rd July 1942. Reference your demi-official letter No.49/306 dated 12th July 1942. 2. The increase or reduction in Oil production in Bahrain is not occasioned by local factors, but by outside conditions of which we here know almost nothing. The recent reduction was carried out on orders from the Bahrain Petroleum Company*s principals in New York, and I quote an extract from their telegram to the local Manager on the subject:- *Qn account of decrease in consumption all markets and failure British Oil Companies to recognise principle short haul between Bahrain and Abadan and loss of markets in Australasia on account of applying principle of short haul and lend lease that territory, we expect crude running will be reduced to 20,000 barrels per day, and all cracking operations discontinued over next three months and possibly for many months to come with also possibility of further reduction.^ The local oil people are somewhat disgruntled as they believe that Abadan, being British, is being given preference, by those who direct oil policy, to Bahrain which is an American concern. 3. There is no immediate prospect of the security position deteriorating on account of the laying off of labour as P.A.D. works at the Refinery have resulted in a good deal of extra employment - a useful balancing factor. But I will watch the position in this respect, and will let you know if it deteriorates Yours sincerely, Lieut .-Commander Q.W. Manson R.N., Staff Officer (Intelligence), C/o Naval Officer in Charge Basra• t.■ Intelligence Suirimary of the Political Agent, Bahrain, for the period 16th to 31st July 1942. 141. Shipping . See Appendix to this Summary. 142. Movements of Officials . (i) The Hon’ble Lt._Colo W.R.Hay, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, arrived at Bahrain by air from Basrah on the morning of 27th July, and left for Bushire in the same aeroplane on the morning of 29th July. (ii) On July 23rd and 24th the Political Agent visited the islands of Jeddah, Umm Na*san and Bena. 143. Royal Visit . At 11.30 a.m. on July 16th H.R.H. the Duke of Gloucester arrived at Miharraq aerodrome en route from Karachi to Basrah. Accompanied by H.H. the Shaikh and the Political Agent he drove from the aerodrome to the Agency, where His Highness took leave of the Duke. Before the Shaikh left, His Royal Highness presented to him a signed photograph of himself in a silver frame. SECRET . No.14 of 1942 . The Duke had intended to resume his flight to Basrah at 2.30 p.m., but a defect in his aeroplane made it necessary for him to postpone his departure till 5.40 p.m. The inter vening period was spent by the Duke at the Agency. H.H. the Shaikh took the greatest pleasure in renew ing his acquaintance with His Royal Highness. When they, met they greeted each other as would old friends, without constraint or formality; and the Shaikh’s delight found expression in his conversation which was unusually free and animated. His Royal Highness* second visit to Bahrain has confirmed the im pression created by the first visit, and has left in the Shaikh’s mind an indelible picture of Royal dignity, simplicity and graciousness. '-44. Other Visitors . (i) Brigadier Minnis arrived on July 21st and left on July 25th after inspecting P.A.D. work at Awali. (ii) Shaikh Fahad bin Salim as Subah, Controller of Finance in Kuwait and the son of a formei Ruler of that Shaikh- dom, arrived in Bahrain on July 24th. He is the guest of H.H. Shaikh Salman, to whom he is paying a friendly visit. He travelled from Kuwait by the overland route. 145. Honour s. (i) H.M. the King has approved the grant to H.H. Shaikh Salman of a personal salute of 11 guns. (The dynastic salute of the Ruler of Bahrain is 7 guns). (ii) Lieut.-Commander W.J.King, Naval Officer in Charge, Bahrain, has been promoted to the rank of Commander. 146. R.A.F. Levies . (i) Colonel Brawn and Lt.-Colonel Hall visited Bahrain during the period under report. The latter unfortunately had an attack of malaria, for which he had to be treated at the Oil Company’s hospital at Awali. (ii) A number of captured Italian machine guns and rifles have arrived for issue to the leviee. / (iii)(iii)On July 25th the levies marched, to the strains of the Police band, from their old quarters near the Fort in Manama to their new barracks on Jiiharraq Island. The march was a great success, and large and friendly crowds lined the route. 147. British Overseas Airways Corporation . At the beginning of May 1942 the British Overseas Airways Corporation announced that there would be five ser vices a week, East and West, through Bahrain. Three services were to be by flying boat and two by land plane. Subsequently one of the flying boat services was given up, and now the two landplane services have also been discontinued. Since July 20 th there have been only two flying boats a week each way. 148. Food Supplies . (i) Reference para 118(i) Of Intelligence Summary No.12 of 1942 in which it was reported that a system of card ration ing for rice, flour and sugar had been introduced. The ration for rice was fixed by Mr. de Grenier, the Bahrain Government Food Controller, at 12 oz. per head per day, or 22J lbs. per month, an amount which was described as M the generally prevailing Army ration'. The issue of rations at this rate rapidly depleted existing stocks of rice, and belated calculations by the Food Controller showed that, if everybody drew their full rations, monthly consumption of rice would amount to more than double the quantity of rice which Bahrain, under the new quota system, is permitted to import. On making this discovery the Food Controller precipitately reduced the rice ration to 12 lbs. a month, a quantity which is manifestly inadequate for people who make rice the main article of their diet. As H.H. the Shaikh was greatly disturbed at these developments, and appeared to think that Bahrain’s rice quota was only about half of the population’s minimum requirements, the Political Agent suggested to the Adviser that he should personally examine and verify the figures, provided by the Food Controller himself, on which Bahrain’s rice quota had been based. The Adviser’s preliminary inquiries indicate that the Food Controller’s original estimates of Bahrain* s minimum requirements of rice were much too low. If the result of these preliminary inquiries is confirmed the Bahrain Government will no doubt ask for a revision of their rice quota. (ii) The Bahrain date crop this year is above average. (iii) The bazaar price of meat, eggs, milk and vegetables has risen owing to the demand for these commodities by the contractors who supply the various defence units now stationed in the island. 149. Currency . (i) Reference Para 133 (iii) of Intelligence Summary No.13 of 1942, in which it was reported that the price of sovereigns on the 15th July was fairly steady at Rs 59-60. Between July 15th and July 20th the price rose slight ly to Rs 60/8/-. On July 21st it fell sharply to Rs57 owing to an order issued by the Political Agent directing that bullion brokers must produce before him every week a statement giving details of all their transactions in gold. When the first shock caused by this order had worn off the price of sovereigns again began to rise but had not, by the end of the month, gone above Rs 60 . The chief bullion brokers in Bahrain are Iraqi Jews. They are chary of taking the risk of smuggling gold out of Bab rain as they know that detection would involve theirmw -3- deportation from the island. They have therefore been adopting the less dangerous and only slightly less profitable plan of ^ selling sovereigns to Kuwaiti brokers and merchants in Bahrain (which is&gt; of course, no offence), and the latter take the risk of smuggling the gold out of the island. The Political ^Agent’s recent order will enable some kind of a check to be kept on local movements of gold, and the activities of Kuwaitis purchas ing gold will, in future, be watched closely by the police. It is not expected that the order now passed will finally put an end to the smuggling of gold from Bahrain; but it will make smuggling more difficult, and to this extent it constitutes a useful move in the game of financial fox and geese which the Political authorities have for many months been playing with Kuwaiti, Basrawi and Bahraini bullion brokers. The greater skill of the brokers in playing this game is balanced by the authority which Political Agents have to alter the rules 5 and so far neither side has scored a decisive advantage. (ii) Reference para 133 (iii) (b) of Intelligence Summary No.13 of 1942 in which it was reported that Saudi Riyals in Qatif were at a premium of Rs 50-60 per thousand. The premium has now risen to Rs 85 per thousand riyals. The supply of riyals is short, and the demand from Iraq and Kuwait continues. The shortage of supply is believed to be due largely to hoarding which, actuated primarily by the desire to hold wealth in tangible form, has recently been stimulated by rumours that the Saudi Government are contemplating the issue of currency notes. (iii) Reference para 118(ii) of Intelligence Summary No.12 of 1942. , . .. Currency notes at Dubai and Sharjah are now at a dis count of only 2j%. The reduction in the premium on rupees is due to the arrival of further consignments of rupees from India. 150. Alarms . On the evening of July 19th information was received of the presence in the Persian Gulf of a suspicious ship. The Naval and Air Force authorities took requisite precautionary measures, and the Defence Officer made appropriate dispositions of all available troops, guns and guards. The ship which had roused suspicion was located off Bahrain on the morning of July 20th. After its bona fides had been established troops and guards returned to their normal stations. The arrange ments set in train by the Defence Officer worked smoothly, and Bahrain Petroleum Company officials gave ready co-operation. 151. Excursions. ft Mirza bin Barkat, the picaroon and slave trader to whom reference was made in para 120 of Intelligence Summary No.12 of 1942, is again on the move. Having been turned out of Fujairah he made his way via Kalba, where he received only a cold welcome, to the Batinah Coast. The Political Agent, Muscat, now reports that Mirza is on his way back to Kalba ana Fujairah as the people of Liwa and Shinas, acting under pressure from the Nftiscat Government, refused to allow him to establish himself among them. Steps are being taken which will, it is hoped, deter him from staying long at either Kalba or Fujairah. .52. Slave Traffic . Reference para 119 of Intelligence Summary No.12 of 1942 in which it was reported that Dohah, the capital of Qatar, was being used as an entrepot in the slave traffic. / Information-4- Information has been received from a source believed to be reliable that in June the Shaikh of Qatar sent to Nejd, in the charge of his servant Abdullah bin Gaanim al Hajiri, twenty slaves as a gift for Ibn Saud. Five of the slaves were women, young and unmarried, and fifteen were men. He also sent two male slaves and two female slaves as a present to bin Jaluwi. It is reported that these slaves had been for a considerable time in Dohah before they made the journey to Nejd. The chief slave brokers in Dohah are stated to be Ershaid Nejdi and bin Athemin. It is probable that the slave traffic has also the connivance, if not the active support, of Shaikh Saleh al Mana, the Shaikh of Qatar’s secretary and confidant. ^ In the first week of July, immediately after the Political /gent’s visit to Qatar, the Shaikh of Qatar issued a proclamation, copies of which were posted prominently in the Dohah bazaars, forbidding the export of slaves from Qatar territory. The mere fact that such a notice was issued appears to confirm the belief that Dohah had become, or was becoming, a recognised slave mart. 153. The Oil Companies . (i) On the 21st July the Political Agent authorised the transmission to Dhahran by radio telephone of an urgent message giving the result of a blood test. The man whose blood-sample had been sent to Bahrain for analysis was an employee of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company who was lying seriously ill in the hospital at Dhahran. This is the second occasion since June 11th, when R/T communication was first established between Bahrain and the mainland, that the service has proved useful in emergency. (ii) Reference para 136(1) of Intelligence Summary No.13 of 1942 in which it was reported that the California Arabian Standard Oil Company hoped to obtain the use of a Pan American Airways machine to transport discharged personnel to the U.S.A. A Pan American Airways machine, duly authorised by the U.S. Middle East Ferry Command, arrived at Bahrain on July 17th and left the following day en route to Cairo carrying as passengers 19 Califoi’nia Arabian Standard Oil Company and 4 Bahrain Petroleum dompany employees. 154. The Persian Gulf Fighter Fund . In response to the appeal recently issued by the Political Resident, the Shaikh of Dubai has given Rs 10,000/- to this Fund, and the Shaikh of Sharjah Rs 3,000. 155. Meteorological . Maximum temperature 108.2° om July 30th. Minimum temperature 81.4° on July 28th. Humidity exceeded 70% on 12 days and 80% on 7 days, the maximum being 94% on July 26th. 156. Corrigendum . In para 66 of Intelligence Summary No.8 of 1942 it was erroneously stated that the last week of April exhibited the Bahrain climate at its worst. Ttfhen those words were written the Political Agent was happily unaware of what the Bahrain climate at its worst was really like. Now he knows. Sd. E.B.Wakefield.

Intelligence Smamary of the Political Agent, Bahrain, for No,15 of 1942 * the period 1st to 15th August 1942. 157. Shipping . See Appendix to this Summary. 158. Movements of Officials . (i) The Hon*ble Lieutenant-Colonel W.R.Hay, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, arrived at Bahrain by the L.T. !, Nearchus ,, on the morning of the 10th August for a stay of about a month in Bahrain. (ii) The Political Agent went to Sharjah by B.O.A.C. plane on the morning of the 4th August and returned by R.A.F. plane on the morning of the 7th. On the morning of August 11th he left Bahrain by B.O.A.C. plane on a month’s recess in India. 159. Other Visitors . (i) On August 1st Sir Sikander Hayat Khan, Premier of the Punjab, passed through Bahrain on the westbound Flying Boat. Cii) Lieut.-Commander Quicke, Staff Officer (Signals) to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, left Bahrain on the 12th August, after a fortnight’s stay, four days of which he spent in hospital suffering from acute sun-burn. (iii) The following military officers visited Bahrain during the period under report Major J.G. Mann, G II 2 Div., August 4th to August 10th.

Shaikh Fahad bin Salim as Subah, having thoroughly outstayed his welcome in Bahrain, is now reported to be depart ing for Kuwait by the overland route on Wednesday, August 19th. His hosts, having expected him to stay for only a few days, entertained him lavishly and, as the days turned into weeks, found it difficult to tone down the splendour of their hospital ity. There have been enormous dinner parties,for some 40 to 50 guests, every night of his stay, and frequent lunches also. His visit has cost some Ps 400 a day, including nearly Rs4000 on meat alone, and the A1 Khalifah, except for its younger members who are greatly enjoying free entertainment, are devoutly pray ing for its end. The prodigality which this visit has involved, and particularly the daily expenditure of 3 bags of rice at a time when that commodity is scarce in Bahrain, has caused ad verse comment in the bazaar#, and it is also suggested that Shaikh Fahad's personal conduct has not been altogether suitable A further unsatisfactory feature of the stay is that Shaikh Fahad has brought in his train a number of Kuwaiti merchants, who have already made unsuccessful attempts to export motor cars from Bahrain and are now said to be busily engaged in preparing to smuggle out gold. His Highness Shaikh Salman, who is perturbed at this possibility, has extracted from Shaikh Fahad a guarantee that his party will not abuse the hospitality that has been lavished upon them. It is hoped that this guarantee will be effective. 160. R.A.F. Levies . Reference para 115 of Intelligence Summary No.12 / ofof 1942, in which mention was made of the slow rate of recruit ment of levies at Sharjah. On his recent visit to Sharjah, the Political Agent discussed this question with the Shaikh, as well as with Captain Lyle (Officer Commanding Levies, Dubai and Sharjah) and the Residency Agent, Sharjah. The Shaikh of Sharjah has no objection to levies for the Sharjah Companies being recruited from outside - whether from Dubai or elsewhere # The difficulty at both Sharjah and Dubai is not so much that of initial recruitment, as that recruits, after serving for a month, then depart for their homes with a month’s pay in their pockets. The Shaikhs are not unhelpful, but their more active backing is necessary before such difficulties can be removed. On his return to Bahrain the Political Agent discussed the question with Lieut.-Colonel Hall, who left Bahrain by B.O.A.C. plane on August llth for a tour down the coast. 161, Slave Traffic . (i) Reference para 119 of Intelligence Summary No.12 of 1942, in which mention was made of the recrudescence of the slave trade on the Persian Coast. A recent report from a Nakhuda of Dubai tells of how, after leaving Kalat on the Persian coast, he encountered a jolly boat with 50 armed pirates who opened fire on him. After hearing from these pirates of the existence of four other boats in the vicinity with a similar complement of men and arms, the Nakhuda returned to Dubai with the maximum despatch. He arrived there on August 1st. (ii) Reference para 157 of Intelligence Summary No,14 of 1942, which told of the peregrinations of Mirza bin Barkat. This gentleman is reported to have returned to Kalba from Muscat territory towards the end of July, and to have stayed at a place called As Saf, some 8 miles south of Kalba, while his boat was being mended at Khaur Kalba. He was last seen on or about the 27th of July sheltering in his boat at an islet just outside Khor Fakkan and on receiving a warning from the local inhabitants, is then said to have left for an unknown destination. His family is believed to be still in Muscat territory at Fazh with the Riyasah tribe. 162. The Oil Companies . (i) Reference para 136(i) of Intelligence Summary No.13 of 1942, in which the decrease in the activities of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the California Arabian Standard Oil Com pany was referred to. On the 1st of August the output of the Bahrain Refinery was increased to 25,000 barrels of crude a day, and was further increased on the 15th August to 33,500 barrels. Of this, 15,000 barrels will continue to be produced from the Bahrain Petroleum Company* s Field, the balance being imported from Saudi Arabia. In consequence of this increase of work at the Refinery, practically all the personnel who had been rendered surplus (vide para 124(ii; of Intelligence Summary No.12 of 1942) have now been re-engaged. Most of them had in the meantime been employed on sheathing and construction work. (ii) On August 14th at 12.20 p.m. a U.S. Army Transport plane landed at the Bahrain airfield, having brought from Basra six American civilians attached to the American Military Mission at Cairo. They had come to inspect certain equipment, rolling stock, cranes, etc. of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, with a view to buying it for the American Army. They had sent no previous intimation-of their coming and were apparently unaware that this equipment was not at Bahrain or that there might be any difficulty over their seeing it. As they had to leave the following day and ordinary methods of communication with Dhahran would have involved considerable delay, (the Company’s daily launch having already left Bahrain), the Company were authorised to arrange by radio telephone for three members of the party to visit Dhahran that afternoon; / they&lt;*• ■3 they left here at about 3.45 p.m. One member of the party is still at Dhahran; the remainder returned to Basra at 2 p.m. on August 15th, giving a lift to four British personnel of various services who had been visiting Bahrain. 163. Small Pox at Dubai and Shariah . There has been a small outbreak of smallpox at Dubai and Sharjah, 7 cases at the former place and 2 at the latter. One person has died and five of the 9 patients have now been discharged. There is vaccine in plenty at Sharjah. 164. The Shaikh of Fu.iairah . Reference para 134 of Intelligence Summary No.13 of 1942, in which it was reported that Shaikh Mohammad bin Hamad ash Sharqi, Shaikh of Fujairah, had gone on a visit to Riyadh. The Shaikh of Fujairah passed through Bahrain on the 10th August on his return from Riyadh. He is anxious to interest Petroleum Concessions Limited in the production of oil in Fujairah, and went to see Mr. Lermitte, the Company^ representative in Bahrain. Mr. Lermitte told him that his Company would not enter into any new commitments or engagements until after the War. 165• The Shaikh of Hira • Shaikh Abdur Rahman of Hira died on the 10th August and was succeeded by his younger son, Saif. 166. Local Rumours . Visiting bedous from the mainland have informed H.H. the Shaikh that people in Saudi Arabia are saying that the British are encouraging Ibn Saud to make trouble with Asir and the Yemen, on the old ’’divide and rule” principle that if all the Arabs ’’looked in the same direction” there was a danger of their turning against Britain, and that their atten tion should therefore be turned into local channels. It is for this reason that we are heavily subsidising Ibn Saud (to whom His Highness had heard that recent large payments of gold had been made). It is said, further, that if the Germans reach Iraq they are likely to be welcomed by the Iraqis, and therefore we are encouraging Ibn Saud to mass his bedous on the Iraqi frontier. These stories do not as yet appear to have had much circulation in Bahrain. 167. Economic. (i) Currency . Practically no movement of sovereigns has been reported during the period under review. The price has remained steady at Rs 59 or thereabouts. (ii) Profiteering . Information has been received which indicates that certain Bahrain flour merchants have given standing instructions to their agents at Karachi to add 12$ to 15% on the genuine cost of flour in their invoices. It should not be difficult to defeat this particular form of rascality by acquiring regular information of the correct. Karachi wholesale prices, and steps in this connexion are being taken. 168. Meteorological . Maximum temperature 110.8° on August 7th. Minimum temperature 81.3 °on August 5th. Average minimum temperature during the period under / report-,11 - I•* mm - ' r wjMHimi report was 85.S 0 . Humidity only twice went below 70% and exceeded 80% on 10 days and 90% on 5. The maximum was 95% on August 12th. From the above it appears that the final sentence of the last Summary needs further revision. Sd. M.G. Dixon, for Political Agent, Bahrainc/o Naval Officer-in-Charge. Basrah. Dear 26th. August, 2942. ✓ Very many thanks for your D .0 .iTo.C/12i56 of 3.8.42.

See Appendix to this Summary. 170. Movements of local officials . (i) The Hon'ble the Political Resident, accompanied by the Assistant Political Agent, was conducted on August 20th by Major Hewitt (then Defence Officer, now Town Major,) round the Defence Units of Bahrain, and on August 31st was shown by Major Hills, D.C.R.E., the protective measures adopted for the Refinery. On August 24th he left by B.O.A.C. plane for Sharjah, Dubai and Muscat and returned by B.O.A.C. plane on August 28th. (ii) Squadron Leader Chase, Air Liaison Officer, left Bahrain for Habbaniyah and Basra on August 22nd and returned on August 31st. 171. Visitors . (i) The following passengers by B.O.A.C. flying boat have passed through Bahrain during the period under report ^§s^bound. On August 20th General Sir Claude Auchinleck, on August 24th Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith and Lieut.-General Corbett, and on August 31st Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan, We stbou nd. On August 28th H.H. the Jam Sahib of Nawa- nagar and Sir Ramaswami Mudnlinr, the Indian members of the War Cabinet and the Pacific War Council in London. % (ii) Senior Royal Air Force Officers have visited Bahrain during the period under report. On August 16th Air Commodore J.P. Coleman, Air Officer in Charge Administration, R.A.F, in Iraq, passed through Bahrain in the morning en route to Shar jah and returned here for the night before leaving for Basra the next morning. On August 20th, the Air Officer Commanding Iraq, Air Vice Marshal H.Vi De Crespigny, M.C., D.F.C., accom panied by Air Commodore M*B. Russell, D.F.C., A.F.C., A.O.C. Persian Gulf Command,and Wing Commander England, inspected the defences of Bahrain and dined at the Agency in the evening; they flew on down the coast the next morning. (iii) Reference para 159 (iv) of Intelligence Summary No.13 of 1942, which referred to the impending departure of Shaikh Fahad bin Salim as Subah of Kuwait and the possibility of members of his entourage smuggling gold out of Bahrain. Before he and his party left on August 19th, Shaikh Fahad had all their baggage examined and threatened dire consequences if any gold was found. None was discovered; the party did, however, take away between one and two lakhs of rupee notes; A_j?ara reference/174 (ii) below in this connexion. 172. Defence . A signal Troop of 19 men, with vehicles and equipment, arrived at Bahrain on the 27th August. More are expected. 173. Food Supplies » ^ (i) Local , The position as regards rice in Bahrain is now satisfactory, as there is over a month’s reserve on the island and the Government of India have increased the Bahrain allotment by 208 tons a month as a consequence of the Bahrain Government’s representation (reference para 148 (i) of Intell igence Summary No.14 of 1942), Flour is still short, as the full quota has not yet started arriving and there is never / moremore than a fortnight’s supply hero. However, nearly 1,000 tons of wheat arrived here from Canada at the beginning of August and constitute a reserve from which the flour supply can be supplemented when necessary. A scheme for the issue of flour to bakers employed and paid by the Bahrain Govern ment, instead of to private individuals, and of ration cards to the populace for bread instead of flour is being worked out. A Food Control Committee has been appointed to assist and advise the Food Controller over food questions and to share his responsibility. Hitherto the Committee has nev^r failed to disagree with the Food Controller, notably as regards the disposal of the wheat referred to above. Though it should constitute some five months' supply, the Committee recommended that almost the whole of it should be distributed during the one month of Ramadhan as a solace to the people for the recent shortage. This suggestion was vetoed by the powers that v but the wheat reserve is likely to have decreased substantially by the end of Ramadhan, unless adequate supplies of flour arrive in the meantime. The authorities have been asked to distribute the wheat as economically as possible. (ii) For Saudi Arabi a. On the 24th August the German radio announced that the British scheme for supplying Saudi Arabia with food supplies from India had broken down owing to the absence of the supplies. This announcement was made when the final arrangements were in fact crystallising and it was hoped that the scheme was about to be launched. But agree ment on details has not yet been reached by all concerned and the scheme still hangs fire. The Shaikh of Bahrain has been informed of the proposals and welcomes them, as he hopes that the price control which the scheme will presumably in volve will put an end to the merchants’ present practice of diverting all supplies possible from Bahrain to the mainland where profits are greater. 174. Currency . (i) The price of sovereigns having, as already reported, remained more or less stationary at Bs 59 during the first half of August, declined to Rs 57 on the 24th and finally closed at Rs 57/8/- on August 31st. These quotations are purely nominal, as very little business in sovereigns is being done. (ii) Reference para 133 (iii) (b) of Intelligence Summary No.13 of 1942, which reported large exports of rupee notes from Bahrain to Kuwait. On August 20th the Manager of the Eastern Bank, Bahrain, reported that some 7 to 8 lakhs worth of rupee notes had gone out of Bahrain in the past 3 weeks, apparently to Kuwait, and requested Government assistance in obtaining air freight from Karachi for an immediate consignment of 4-J lakhs of notes and for such consignments thereafter as might be necessary; the alternative being for all drawers of other than local cheques or drafts to be charged 12% commission on account of the cost to the Bank, in freight and insurance, of bringing the notes by sea. Fs 4J lakhs of notes arrived on the 24th August, after having awaited air space at Karachi for over a fortnight. The Bank has already brought over Rs 41 lakhs of notes from India since the beginning of this year, as against an average of Ps 10 lakhs per year in previous years. The normal process now appears to be for the notes exported from Bahrain to be changed in Kuwait into Dinar notes, which are taken to Basra and converted into Rupee drafts on India. (iii) There is a great shortage of small change in Bahrain, / duep 175 c 176. 177. 178. 179. 180 . due partly to hoarding by those of the poorer classes with money to save, who find it preferable to hoard coin rather than notes as it neither burns nor rots and has some intrinsic value. The Bank is expediting a consignment of coin by steamer shortly, to relieve the' shortage. The Oil Companies . Reference para 162 (i) of Intelligence Summary No.15 of 1942, which announced an increase in the output of the Bahrain 011 Refinery to 33,500 barrels of crude a day. The daily production of crude oil from the Bahrain Field has now in creased to 18,000 barrels. Local Affairs . Reference para 125 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No. 12 of 1942 regarding the collection of 'Relief of the Poor' Funds. V : - 111 feeling between the Shias and Sunnis during the past two months has been very bitter and has been fomented by talk in clubs and by trouble-seekers. On the 27th August a joint meeting of the members of both Sunni and Shia Committees was held under the aegis of His Highness the Shaikh. After much discussion both parties agreed to His Highness’ suggestion that a joint Committee, consisting of from 4 to 6 members of each community, should be formed, with Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa, His Highness’ uncle, as President, to meet once a month and distribute the funds collected; thus co-operation, at least on the surface, has been achieved. The Sunnis, who contain a larger proportion of The Rich, gave Rs 1500 (actually provid ed wholly by His Highness) to the Shias in fulfilment of a previous promise, and also half of the donationsby non-Moslems, which now total over Fs 4000. On August 29th, to celebrate this happy rapprochement, a garden party was given by one of the Shia notables, which was attended by His Highness, the Adviser, and members of both Sunni and Shia Committees. American Mission’s Tour to Saudi Arabia . On August 17th Dr. and Mrs. Harrison and Dr.Barney, of the American Mission, Bahrain, with one male and two female Indian nurses, a party of 11 in all, left Bahrain on 1^- month* s special medical trip to Riyadh to treat members of the household of King Ibn Saud, as well as the general public. Rs 5500 worth of medical supplies were taken. The Mission intend to put up a hospital in Hassa. S lave Traffic . Reference para 161 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.15 of 1942. Mirza bin Barkat is now reported to have gone to Mekran, accompanied by his family and followers. Epidemics at Dubai ^nd Sharjah . The outbreak of smallpox mentioned in para 163 of Intelligence Summary No.15 of 1942 appears to have spent itself, but a few mild cases of typhoid have recently occurred among the R.A.F. at Sharjah. They have been brought to the Bahrain Government Hospital for treatment and arrangements have been made for the Hospital’s isolation ward to be placed at their disposal should further cases develop in any number. The Shaikh of Hira . Reference para 165 of Intelligence Summary No.15 of 1942, which recorded the death of Shaikh Abdur Rahman of Hira and the succession of his nephew Saif. It has since been reported that there were two contestants to the succession« &lt;The first was Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan, son of the Shaikh of Sharjah, who retired when Saif took possession of the Fort and the towers* The second was Shaikh Saqr bin Abdullah, nephew of the Regent of Kalba, who was in Hira when the late Ruler died but was then immediately ordered to leave* He went to Dubai and sent two parties of warriors to take Hira, the first by car and the second in a lighter carrying rice^ but both were forestalled by the defenders and retired with out firing a shot. P 181. Pearls. Reference para 138 of Intelligence Summary No.13 of 1942 which reviewed the condition of the pearling industry. The price of pearls in Bombay is since reported to have gone down by 25% as a result of recent Congress antics. It is now, however, beginning to rise again, according to latest information. 182. Meteorological . Maximum temperature 104.8° on August 29th. Minimum temperature 80.5° on August 16th. Humidity only twice descended below 70% and exceeded 80% on nine days and 90% on two. Sd. M.G.

See Appendix to this Summary. 184* Movements of Officials ,, (i) The Hon 1 ble Lieut .-Colonel W.R.Hay, Cd.Eo, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, left Bahrain for Bushire in the LoTc ‘’Nearchus'’ on the morning of September 11th. (ii) The Political Agent returned from recess in India by B 0 O 0 A.C. flying-boat on September 12th, 185, Food Supplies , (i) Reference para 173 (i) of Intelligence Summary No,16 of 1942, which referred to a scheme for the issue of flour to bakers instead of individual consumers and to the appointment of a Food Control Committee, The Committee were unanimously opposed to the ’bakers’ scheme and on this occasion the Food Controller agreed with their recommendation. The scheme has accordingly been abandon ed and flour will continue to be handed out to individual con sumers, who will make their own arrangements for cooking it. During the month of Ramadhan every one who requires and can afford it is to be given 4 lbs, of Canadian wheat in addition to the existing (but manifestly insufficient) ration of 4 lbs. of flour, the smallness cf which is mainly due to the non arrival of the monthly flour quotas ^rom IndiaThe only milling machine in Bahrain being out of order,^individual con sumers will make their own arrangements for grinding their wheat ration on stone hand-mills. (ii) At the end of July the Bahrain Government were asked v/hether they could store sugar which was being collected by the M.E.S.C. for eventual use in Iran and Iraq® they replied that storage was available in their Customs warehouse for 4,000 tons. In the last few weeks 7,835 tons of sugar have arrived and the Bahrain Customs are busily hiring godowns all over the town in which to accommodate this inconveniently large stock. Though the Bahrain Government have agreed to levy only^ one third of the usual storage charges and have, as a further special concession, reduced Customs duty on the consignment from 5% to 1%, their revenues should materially benefit from this arrangement. Popular rumour, to which the Public Relations Officer has been asked to give the lie, has it that all this sugar was originally intended for Russia but had to be diverted here because,if it were sent to its original destination, it would be likely to fall into enemy hands. 186, Currency , Reference para 174 (iii) of Intelligence Summary No. 16 of 1942, which referred to the shortage of small coin in Bahrain. On September 5th the Eastern Bank received by sea a consignment of Ps 19,000 in small change, but most of it has already vanished from circulation. Since August Isn the Bank has paid out some Ps 25,000 in small change (of v/hich about Ps 5,000 has gone to the Bahrain Petroleum Company,) and has only about Ps 5,000 left. The arrival of a further consignment is hoped for shortly. 187. Military . On the afternoon of September 5th a military manoe uvre cn the grand scale was performed by the detachnsnu cx tne 11th Sikh Regiment stationed at Bahrain. It was watched by a / largeQTS) - 2 - largo and most interested audience which included the Politid. •: Resident, H.H. the Shaikh, many of the A1 Khalifah, a contingent of the State Police and many members of the H. community. The manoeuvre consisted of an attack by infan.,, and bren-guns, using live ammunition, smoke bombs and trench mortars, and supported by Machine Guns and two heavy guns, on an enemy entrenched position along a ridge; the enemy infantry were represented by petrol tins 0 After the hill had been fnkr. and the troops re-assembled, the British and Indian Officere taking part were introduced to H.H. the Shaikh, who was then taken for a ride in a bren-gun carrier. At the beginning of the exercise the spectators were between the attacking infantry and their objective, and shells whistled over their heads. The whole of this realistic and instructive demonstration was carried through without casualties, human or animal. 3.88. Vis itation of Storks . On September 4th it was reported from the Oil C r np at Awali that some 200 migrant birds of unknown species ancf enormous size had arrived. One had committed suicide by fly:- into the Refinery and its carcase was sent to Mr. Bertram Them - the Public Relations Officer, for identification. If was yve— nounced to be a stork and a tab round its leg read;- DNIVSRSITE KAUNAS LITHUANIE B 3973 The fact that the local inhabitants have no name for these birds and that Bahrain notables went after them with guns• whereas in other parts of the Arab world they are never mole heec and are in places almost sacrosanct, suggests that Bahrain has seldom, if ever, seen them before. Two theories that have been advanced for their arrival here are (a) that they had b on some active war front and didn't like it, and (b) that in might presage an early or severe winter. Finding no food a, Bahrain, they flew on, in a direction not observed. It was-, no doubt, a coincidence that the same night a son was born to Mrs. Wakelin, wife of the Bahrain Government Director of .Iduca- tion. 189. Broadcasting . On September 15th the following news item was broad cast from Radio Saigons- 'A strong contingent of American troops has landed in Bahrain, which is an oil-rich island in the Persian Gulf, to control the oil interests and to defend the Americans' 1 . 190. Local Affairs . The Bahrain Government has advanced a loan of Fs 21 1 to Khan Sahib Haji Yusuf bin Ahmed Kanoo. The ostensible object of this loan is to provide the recipient with capital with which to engage in trade. 191. Meteorological. Maximum temperature 101.5 0 on September 1st.

R.A.F., Sharjah, made a forced landing near^Dohah, in the Qatar peninsula, on September 17th. The aircraft was not seriously damaged and every assistance was rendered by the staff of the Qatar Oil Company. 197. Currency . (i) The price of sovereigns in Bahrain has remained steady at Ps 56/8/-. The price of gold in Bahrain is still substantial ly lower than it is in Basrah or Kuwait, and the margin^of difference is sufficient to act as a stimulus to smuggling. The steadiness of the local price indicates, however,^that smuggling is no longer taking place on any but a negligible scale. (ii) Reference para 149 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.14 of 1942 in which it was reported that the premium on Saudi / Riyals- 2 - 198 o 199 „ Riyals had risen to Rs 85 per thousand Riyals. At present the premium on Saudi Riyals is Rs 20 per thousand if Riyals are purchased for silver rupees 0 If rupee currency notes are tendered, the premium on Riyals is Rs 60 per thousand Riyalso The fall in the value of the Riyal against the rupee is believed to be due to a decline in the demand for Riyals from Kuwait (cf* para 133 (iii) (b) of Intelligence Summary No,13 of 1942)o Riyals are still reported to be scarce through out Hasa« Food Supplies - Bahrain , (i) For several months shipments of rice and wheat flour from India to Bahrain have been disappointingly small, and the island has been receiving only a fraction of its allotted quota of these commoditieso Stocks of rice are sufficient only for three weeks, and there is less than one week r s supply of flour availableo As the public have been receiving up to date their full ration (small though it is) of rice and flour, there is no general anxiety about the food position* But H e Ho the Shaikh is aware of the real state of affairs and is deeply worried and anxious* Mitigating factors are the good date crop, and a reserve of several hundred tons of Canadian wheat* But if, as seems likely, stocks of rice become exhausted in the course of the winter an economic crisis will ensue which will almost certainly be attended by grave political consequences* (ii) Reference para 185 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.17 of 1942 in which it was reported that 7835 tons of sugar^had been stored in Bahrain by the M*E*3*C. for eventual use in Iran and Iraq* The majority of this sugar has now been stored in go-downs but many hundreds of bags are still stacked on the Customs pier. The sight of so much sugar has provoked much comment locally. Many housewives are asking why the sugar ration should not be increased when there is so vast a quantity of sugar stored in Bahrain. Others argue that if the British Government has such large reserves of sugar it must also have equally la^ge reserves of rice and flour with which, in time of need, it can help the people of Bahrain* The latter argu ment, illogical and fallacious as ii* obviously is, appears everywhere to be accepted as valid, and there will be a violent revulsion of feeling should the shortage of rice become more acute and help from the ’’British Government*' fail to materialise. Food Supplies - Saudi Arabia * Major Griffin, representing the MiE.S.C., and Mr. Negib Salha, one of Ibn Baud*s Ministers, visited Bahrain during the period under report in order to discuss with^the Political Resident the merits and practicability of various schemes which have been propounded with the double objects of supplying Saudi Arabia with essential foodstuffs from India and of enabling the Saudi Government to attract to its Treasury at least the number of Riyals which it requires to finance its public services* Major Griffin was mainly interested in the solution section of long-term problems* Mr* Negib Salha proved to be less interested in arrangements or undertakings for the future than in the problem of immediate supplies for Saudi Arabia, especially for the Province of Hasa where^rice and flour are badly needed, and it seemed that he was timorous of returning to Riyadh to face Ibn Saud without some^concrete achievment to his credit. Mr. Negib Salha’s objective was to some extent attained in that he succeeded in securing 300 tons of wheat on loan from H.H* the Shaikh of Bahrain on the understanding that the loan would be repaid in kind at the earliest opportunity; and he also reached an understanding with the Political Agent, Kuwait, in regard to supplies of %-3- 'IWV sugar„ Only in respoct of rico, the commodity needed most of all in Saudi Arabia, did he fail in his pleadings. In Bahrain and Kuwait rice is too precious to be spared even to a friendly neighbour. 200o Anti-British sentiment . There are very few people in Bahrain with marked anti-British feelings. Those who have such feelings are mainly semi-educated youths who resent, on general grounds, the presence in Bahrain of foreigners whose influence is so obviously paramount in the shaping of the island’s destinies. A clique of such youths has been in the habit of gathering at the coffee-shop of a certain Ahmed al Farah to didcuss news heard over the Berlin and Home wireless. On September 17th Ahmed al Farah was arrested for preparing and serving food during day-time (Ramadhan is strictly observed in^Bahrain), and Isa bin Hijris, Hitler’s most vocal adherent in Bahrain, was arrested for eating food in a coffee-shop during forbidden hours. The arrests are approved by public opinion, which has no sympathy for persons who openly offend against religious propriety. 201. Local Affairs . (i) Reference para 176 of Intelligence Summary No.16 of 1942 in which it was reported that a Committee had been formed under the Chairmanship of H.H. the Shaikh of Bahrain’s uncle, Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah, to supervise distribution of funds collected for the relief of the poor. The Committee expended a substantial portion of^the funds at its disposal on the purchase of rice, the intention being to dole out rice in small quantities to persons who could not afford to buy it for themselves. Distribution was entrusted to Haji Khalil Mu’ayyad, a prominent local merchant who is also a member of the Manama Municipal Committee. Khalil Mu’ayyad had distributed about half of the rice purchased by the Committee to his own relatives, to prostitutes and to boys of doubtful character when the tongue of scandal became active and he was relieved of his position of trust. Distribution of the balance of the rice is now being controlled by a small committee whose disinterestedness has not yet been called in question. Haji Khalil MU’ayyad, it may be added, is^one of the very few leading merchants of Bahrain who are positively anti-British. (ii) Ill-feeling between Shias and Sunnis persists, par ticularly in Muharraq, where two small clashes between Arabs and Persians have recently occurred. Even when relations between the two communities are normal such outbursts are not uncommon during the month of Ramadhan. (iii) The Bahrain Government have decided, in order both to relieve unemployment and to improve the amenities of^ Manama, to extend the Sea Road by some 330 yards at its Western end, so that it runs beyond the Government Hospital. 202. War Funds . (i) Some months ago Major Hickinbotham, O.B.E., Politi cal Agent, Kuwait, presented a valuable Kashan rug to be dis posed of for the benefit of the Persian Gulf Fighter Fund.^It was decided to raffle the rug, and tickets were on sale from the second half of July in Manama and Awali.^ When the draw for the raffle took place on September 24th it was disclosed that tickets had been sold to the value of no less than Rs2775. By a happy coincidence Major Hickinbotham was himself present in Bahrain on September 24th and attended, the draw for the raffle. /. . \ (n)(ii) The Bahrain War Fund benefitted to the extent of Bs 10 ? 574/2/- from a Charity Ball held at Awali on September 24th 6 203.

(ii) Mr. Bertram Thomas, Public Relations Officer, who accompanied the Hon'ble the Political Resident to Bushire on September 30th, had not returned to Bahrain by the end of the period under report. 207. Visitors . (i) Dr. Wellington-Koo passed through Bahrain on the East- bound flying boat on October 10th. (ii) Lieut.-Col. Henkel, Persian Gulf Service Command, spent a few days in Bahrain as the guest of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. He returned to Basrah on October 11th. (iii) Hon. M.R. Bridgeman, representative of the Petroleum Department, arrived in Bahrain from India on October 13th. He intends to leave for Basrah on October 19th after paying a short visit to Dhahran in the meantime. 208. Currency . Reference paras 133 (iii) (b) of Intelligence Summary No. 13 of 1942, and 174 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.16 of 1942 in which it was reported that rupee currency notes wore being exported from Bahrain to Kuwait in large quantities. This export still continues, and on October 6th a motor launch left for Kuwait carrying notes to the value of nearly three lakhs of rupees. 209. Food Supplies q Bahrai n. The position in regard to rice is still causing acute anxiety as there are no reserves of this commodity in Bahrain and consignments arriving are barely sufficient to keep pace with current consumption. The position has not improved in the period under report during which only 1500 bags (excluding R.E. cargo) have arrived - a quantity sufficient to last for less than a week. The situation in regard to flour would be even more acute than the rice situation were it not for the Bahrain Government* s reserve of several hundred tons of Canadian wheat which is being used to supplement the inadequate supplies of flour being received from India. Authorised rations have been on the following scale:- Rice - 12 lbs. per adult per mensem Wheat or Flour - 4 lbs. ** ' ” Sugar - 4 lbs. ft n ’* 11 With effect from October 11th, the beginning of the current Arabic month, persons in possession of ration cards will be entitled to increase their wheat or flour ration, ab. the expense of their rice ration i.e. cut of a combined-wheat* or flour rice ration of 16 lbs. per month, they can take such proportion as they wish in the form of wheat or fl^fur subject to the rice ration of 12 lbs. per month not being exceeded. / The- 2 - Thc intention of this *pp*rcnt concession is to reduce to some extent consumption of rice, the compensating increase in the consumption of wheat or flour being met from the Government’s reserve of Canadian wheat» Indian residents of Bahrain (ether than Bengalis) and a number of Persians and Jews are taking advantage of the concession. H.H. Shaikh Salman is deeply worried about the food situ ation, and can think and speak of little else. He sees in imagination his subjects streaming from Bahrain to avoid starvati in the same way as emigrants have during recent months been streaming from the Persian side of the Gulf 5 : and he pictures to himself the shame in which he will be held if, as an Arab ruler, he cannot keep his people from starvation. The Shaikh is wise enough, however, (and proud enough) to confide his forebodings to few, and in public he pours scorn on the alarmist talk which is becoming increasingly common in Manama and Muharraq 210. Food SuppliesSaudi Arabia . News that an expedition is shortly to scour the deserts of Arabia in pursuit of locusts has filtered through to the mainland; and a visitor from Hasa, discussing the ex pedition and its objects, remarked somewhat plaintively r *We eat locusts, you know”. 211o Drilling on Hawar Island . In October 1941 the Bahrain Petroleum Company were given permission to drill holes on the main Hawar Island in order to obtain information of the geological structure there. The Bahrain Government were particularly pleased at the in clusion of this item in the Company’s drilling programme both because it afforded further evidence of the British Govern ment’ s acceptance of their claim to sovereignty over the Hawar Islands, and because they hoped thereby to secure a water supply on the main island. ^At the beginning of October the Company informed the Bahrain Government of their intention to start drilling operations immediately after the end of Ramadhan. Since the institution of drilling operations sc near to his territory would undoubtedly have incensed the Shaikh of Qatar to an inordinate degree, and would have prompted many awkward questions at a time when awkward questions are particularly unwelcome (the Qatar Oil Company’s drilling equipment is in the process of being loaded for shipment to India) the Bahrain Petroleum Company were asked to postpone indefinitely their drilling programme on and near the Hawar Islands. The Company readily agreed to the postponement asked for, and it only re mains now to devise an explanation acceptable to the Shaikh of Bahrain for the deferment of a project in which he takes sc keen a personal interest. 212. Broadcasting . Bahrain has been mentioned several times during the^ last fortnight in Arabic broadcasts from Berlin, Bari and Tokio. Cne announcement was to the effect that a British Military Dictator had been appointed in Bahrain, and that he was shortly to be joined by an American Military Dictator. All three stations stressed the dominance of American influence in the island owing to America’s oil interests there. 213. ’Id. (i) On October 11th and 12th the Political Agent made the customary round of ’Id calls. When he called on H.H. the Shaikh he was accompanied by Major Hewitt, M.C., Tcwn Major, who was assumed by Bedouin visiters to be a highly placed British General. It is not unlikely that Major Hewitt is the nucleus around which the story of a. ’’British Military Dictator (vide para 212 above) has been built up. / (ii)(ii) H-ji Khalil Mu’cyyad 2 the morchant who sc crudely advertised the least reputable aspect cf his private life by the manner in which he distributed rice for which he was a Trustee (para 201 cf Intelligence Summary No.18 of 1942 refers) was brought on to the select list of those on whom the Political Agent pays an ’Id call in 1941. This year his name was struck off the list. The intrigues in which Khalil Mu’ayyad engaged in order to secure the restoration of his name to the list indicate that the privilege of receiving a formal call from^ the Political Agent on the occasion of the ’Id is one to which considerable value is attached locally. 214. Th e Bahrain Petroleum Cokpany . There is a feeling of unrest among British employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company caused by their continued detention in Bahrain without the opportunity of returning home. This feeling is naturally strongest among those whose wives or families or fiancees are in the British Isles, and contributing factors are both the enervating climate and the absence of suitable feminine society. The problem of assuaging these feelings is a difficult and delicate one, and the efficacy cf the temporary palliatives sc far applied will lessen as the weeks go by without appearing to bring the end of the War any closer. 215. Meteorological . Maximum temperature 94.5^ on October 6th. Minimum temperature 74.6° on October 13th. Humidity fell below 70% on one day only. It exceeded^ 80% on ten days, and 90% on five days, the maximum being 96% on October 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 12th. Sd. E.B. Wakefield.

HJy dear Wakefield, When I was in South Africa I was surprised to see references in all the papers to the effect that there had been a revival in the slave trade in recent months from Persia to Arabia and that the news had been reported from Bahrain. I see from your Diary for the period 16th to 30th June 1942 that you refer in para graph 119 to some highly coloured rumours regarding the trade in Qatar, without however giving any definite facts concerning it. A further reference to these rumours is made in paragraph 152. 2. As you are aware' the Gulf Diaries now receive t a very wide circulation — far larger than one would desire — and it is impossible to say who will or who will not read any particular item. The normal reaction of an outsider to a paragraph implying that the slave trade was flourishing in the Persian Gulf would be to wonder why we did not do something about it instead of telling the world* While, therefore, I have no desire that you should make your Diaries in any way less interesting, I would be glad if you would see that items are not included which are likely to recoil upon our heads. 3 . Guedalla says of the Great Duke and slavery in his 'Wellington' (page 257) ’He has been startled whilst in England by 'the degree of frenzy' felt in this admirable cause.* The least we can do is to see that this * frenzy* is excited by fact and not by rumour.

The greater part of this expenditure has been incurred in connexion with the construction of camps on Muharraq and the extension of the aero drome there. Intelligence Summary of the Political Agent, Bahrain, for the period 16th to 31st October 1942. m) 220. Roval Air Force Le vies. Colonel Hall, Commandant of the Persian Gulf Levy^Force, has been ill during most of the summer and recently relinquished command of the Levies. His place is being taken by Major Pa»ce who is at present in Gwadur. Major Kinnaird, who has been in _ command of the R.A.F. Levies at Bahrain since they were raised in May 1942, has been transferred to Gwadur to relieve Major ieace. Major Kinnaird left for Gwadur on October 27th. 221. Food Supplies - Bahrain . (i) In previous Intelligence Summaries reference has been made to the alarm felt by His Highness the Shaikh at the steady diminution of stocks of rico in Bahrain. .At one time supplies of rice in the island were sufficient to last for less than thrvc weeks, and the rate of consumption, though it has been controll^a for several .months, was still greatly in excess of the- 2 - supply. During the porio^ undor report pomo 63.0 tone of (excluding H.S. c®rgo; hp.vo arrived in Bahrain, and the position has boon temporarily eased. The amount of 630 tons (which include... a special consignment of 450 tons arranged by the Government of India) represents about five weeks consumption. During the same period some 72 tons of wheat flour arrived in Bahrain (exclusive of flour for re-export to Saudi Arabia). This amount represents about 10 days consumption. P (ii) In the second half of June (vide para 118 (i) of Intelli gence Summary No.12 of 1942) the margin of profit allowed to merchants importing rice and flour was raised from 10 % to^20%. This concession was made in order to induce merchants to import these commodities into Bahrain rather than to other ports in the Persian Gulf, especially those in Saudi Arabia, where no price control existed and where profits were phenomenally high. The system of issuing permits for the export of quota goods from India has recently been changed, and the Bahrain Government, owing to the power which they now have to distribute quotas as they please among local merchants, are no longer compelled to pander to their avarice. The margin of profit allowed on imported quota goods has accordingly been reduced to 5%. Merchants who are not pre pared to accept this profit will not be given a share in the trade in rice, flour, sugar etc.? those who do accept the profit of 5% will be compelled to import foodstuffs to the limit of the quota allotted to them on pain of forfeiting their right to future quotas. P (iii) The presence in Bahrain of so many Defence-personnel dependent on the local market for supplies of fresh food has drained the bazaar of most of its usual stocks. Eggs and potatoes are unobtainable, while moat and vegetables cost so much that only the wealthier classes can afford them. The price of dates has risen, but fish is plentiful and still comparatively cheap. (iv) Though there are extensive date gardens on the island, Bahrain has always had to supplement its supply of locally grown dates with imports'from Arabia and Iraq to the value of several lakhs of rupees annually-. This year difficulty is being ex perienced in obtaining dates since their export from Hasa has been forbidden and their price in Iraq is prohibitive. ^Private negotiations are in progress which will result, it is hoped, in^ permission being given for the export to Bahrain from Hasa of 10,00 galias of dates (valued at about Fs 30,000), but efforts to obtain dates from Iraq at a reasonable price have so far proved abortive. Iraqi date owners, it is reported, refuse to sell locally at the price fixed by the Iraq Government as they can secure higher prices in Syria. ’Yhether Bahrain, in order to secure its minimum essential requirements of dates, should make purchases in the ’black market’ is a question which is now being given consideration by His Highness the Shaikh. (v) Various members of the A1 Khalifah, when applying fer^ ration cards, supplied exaggerated figures of the number of their dependents. The”Food Controller had neither the knowledge nor the courage to reduce those figures to their correct proportions, but His Highness the Shaikh has now intervened and appointed his cousin, Shaikh Ibrahim bin Mohammed bin Isa al hhalifah, to^be a member of the Food Control Advisory Committee^with the special duty of seeing that members of the Ruling Family do not take advantage of their position to secure preferential treatment in the distribution of food rations. 222. Food Supplies - S au di A rabia,. Reference para 199 of Intelligence Summary No.18 of 194? in which it was reported that His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain had agreed to release 300 tons of wheat on loan to the Saudi Govern-- ment. The amount which has actually been shipped to Saudi Ar^bi-^ is 3000 bags (225 tons). It is not known if or when shipment^of the balance of the 75 tons promised will be asked for by the Saudi Government. . / 223.-3- 223. Currency - Bahrain 0 (i) The price of sovereigns has dropped fractionally from Rs 56/8/- to Ps 56/-/-. (ii) There are still no signs of a recrudescence of the gold smuggling which took place earlier in the summer, and it seems that the Political Agent's order of July 21st making bullion brokers submit weekly statements of their transactions in gold has proved to be an even greater deterrent to smuggling than was expected at the time (vide para 149 (i) of Intelligence Summary No o14 of 1942). (iii) Reference para 186 of Intelligence Summary No.17 of 1942 in which a shortage of small coin in Bahrain was reported. The shortage has become even more marked than it was, and bazaar trade is suffering as a consequence. Neither shopkeepers nor their customers possess small change, and the only means of obtaining it is by purchase - at a substantial premium - from one or other of the Ring of brokers who have made a corner of small coin. The Bahrain Government were assailed by so many complaints from^the public that they began devising laws and regulations prohibiting the hoarding of small coin, penalising its sale at other than its face value, and so on. They were eventually dissuaded from en acting this legislation, which would certainly have had results exactly the reverse of what was desired, and were advised to await patiently the arrival of a large consignment of small coin which the Eastern Bank had ordered from Bombay. Ps 30,000 in small coin would already have arrived by the end of the period under report had not the Captain of the steamer which was to bring it to Bahrain refused to take delivery as there was no strong room on his ship. The consignment is expected to arrive by another steamer early in November. When it does arrive, and when so much small coin^is put into circulation, members of the Ring will be put out of business and will probably liquidate their own holdings. It may be observed cn passant, that it is the contraction in their business in gold which has led brokers to attempt a 'corner' in small coin. These brokers have a considerable amount of capital, which they cannot bear to leave idle. Operations on the gold market being denied t&lt; them, they naturally looked for an alternative method of making their money productive. It will be interesting to see what new scheme they embark upon when their present activities cease to b^ remunerative. ^24. Currency - Qatar. That rupee notes are not welcomed in Qatar is evident from correspondence which has recently taken place between Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani and Mr. Packer, Local Manager of Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. The Shaikh sent Mr. Packer a cheque for Fs 20,000 cn the Eastern Bank, Bahrain, asking that t.e proceeds might be sent to him in silver. Mr. Packer replies, t x the proceeds of the cheque, if paid in silver, would amount nly to Rs 19,100. The Shaikh was then in a quandary. It would revc][t his whole being to accept Fs 19,100 when he was entitled to Fs20,000$ at the same time he was aware that rupee notes had nothing their face value in purchasing power in his territory. Eventually he decided to take the full Rs .20,000 in notes. The reasons for this decision are conjectural, but probably the Shaikh came reluctantly to the conclusion that for local purchases and payments he would have to draw on his substantial hoardings of silver rupees while the notes could be used for purchases in India. The^follow- ins extract from a letter sent by the Shaikh to Mr. Packer is indicative of the annoyance which the whole affair occasioned him^- I express my deep regret at this unexpected treatment given me by the Bank. I understand from your letter that the Bank Manager is unable to cash our cheque in s J lver -H}, full, but that he can do so if the sum is reduced by Ps 900/ We were not prepared for such dealings from the Bank or its / Manager./ 229. Manager &lt;, This may bo a lesson to us for the future,, 'Do you think it just for the Bank Manager to leal with us thus? And is it proper that the Bank Manager should allow himself to knock a part off the sum deposited with him when he has been making a profit from it all these years, without our ever thinking of asking for any compensation? Indeed, this is very strange* 'Now you may please cash our cheque in currency notes * * ooooooooooooooooooovooeoooooooooooooooeooo 225. The Ruling Family . (i) Shrikheh/iyesha, who was, during Shaikh Hamad ’s life time, his senior and favourite wife, has not been treated generously by Shaikh Salman since his father’s death. Formerly Shaikh Hamad not only gave her an allowance of Ps 300 p.m. but also paid all her bills and all charges incurred on the maintenance of her large household establishment. Shaikh Salman, who does not like Shaikeh Lyosha and whose wife has always been jealous of her, gives her an allowance of Ps 300 p.m. only and refuses any additional help. Shaikheh dyesha 1 s position is a pitiable one as she cannot subsist on this meagre allowance in a manner in any way consonant with the dignity of her position as widow of the late Huler and she is too proud to sell her jewellery. She is contemplating an appeal to the Political Agent since the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, though sympathetic, is not in a position to help her. (ii) His Highness Shaikh Salman is sending to Ibn Saud a present of 50 camels and 15 horses. This gift has not been^prompts by any instinct of generosity, but has its origin in the Shaikh's desire to relieve himself of the financial burden of keeping an unnecessarily large stable. P 226. L ocal Affairs . (i) Petrol in Bahrain is unlimited in quantity and cheap in price, but as stocks of tyres and spare parts are now almost ex hausted and cannot be replaced the number of motor cars infuse in the island is rapidly diminishing. The problem of providing al ternative means of transport is a difficult one, as the use of horse-drawn vehicles on any considerable scale would necessitate increased imports of fodder. Anticipating further deterioration in the transport position the Bahrain Government have issued an order ^ prohibiting the export of donkeys. The Bahraini donkey, it may be adde1, is a useful beast as it can carry very heavy loads and, though omnivorous, will still thrive on a starvation diet. P (ii) The Bahrain Court has decided that in future persons who are convicted of gambling will be sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine. Gambling is believed by the Bahrain Court to be a potent factor in transforming honest men into thieves. P 227. B roadcasting . Bahrain has again been the subject of radio comment from Berlin. This time it was not an American Military Dictator but the United States Navy which, it was alleged, had been sent to Bahrain to protect American oil interests there. 228. S muggling ^f Arms . On October 22nd - 23rd one of His Majesty's Ships based on Bahrain carried cut a patrol over the area between the Bahrain Light Vessel and a point about 20 miles S.B. of Has Hakan on the Qatar peninsula. Though no arms were found, information of inters was obtained about the movements and cargoes of country craft en countered in the course of the patrol.229« American i ntorcstg o (i) Lieutenant C.3. Gode'.in 9 U.3.N.R., Inspector of Naval Material, and Ensign R.M. Daniel, his Assistant, arrived at Bahrain on October 27th. They have been given accommodation by the Bahrain Petroleum Company and it is understood that they wiTT remain in Bahrain indefinitely. Their duties are confined to the inspection of cargoes of oil being exported from Bahrain for use by ships of the U.S. Navy. (ii) Mr. Bridgeman, during his visit to Dhahran (vide para 218 (ii) of this Summary) made an interesting collection of re marks which he had heard,illustrative of the- attraction which Americanisms exercise over local Arabs. ^ Apparently one of he commoner forms of greeting extended to him by passers- y was e surprising oxymoron M 0kaydam M .

Poor people cannot afford to buy rice or dates or flour at their present prices,_and are o-n- sequently half-starved. Saudi officials inv.via y ^ th-Ta semi-starvation to the failure of supplies from In.^ea, _ but the real cause is undoubtedly the ever-increasing gap which exists between the maximum price that the consumer c^n -- to pay for his food and the minimum.price at which he ■nnrch o so it.

In Dr. Storm's opinion Shaikh Hamad’s health is likely to deteriorate' still further,^and it is questionable whether he will live for more than a very few years longer. During Dr. Storm's visit the Ruler, Shaikh Abdulla, h-d a severe attack of ptomaine poisoning. He was unconscious for several hours, and while Dr. Storm was administering an enema in one 'room, grave clothes were being prepared next door. It is probable that, but for Dr. Storm's presence on the spot, 3h ikh Abdulla would have died. Since the family clearly require regular medical attention, the Ruler has asked the Qatar Oil Company ^to allow him to employ Dr. Dhami, the Company’s Sikh doctor who ^ will^ no longer be required by them at Dukhan. The request is being given sympathetic consideration and will probably be acceded to. Dr. ^ ± . i i.i-i a p hC'^^ 256 is Dhami is a reliable though not highly qualified doctor nothing against him politically, and the presence of a doctor in Dohah is to be welcomed for many reasons. His chief failing is his avarice - a quality of which, in Oatrr, he will not have t u:; monopoly. Dr. Storm reports that the general attitude of Shaikh Abdulla and his entourage was markedly pre-British — far taore sc than it was eighteen months ago. The illness of Shaikh Abdulla has stimulated discussd n about the succession to the Shaikhdom. It is generally ^cceouel that Shaikh Abdulla will be succeeded by his second son, shaikh ^ Hamad (the elder son, Ali, being a recluse who has severed himsole entirely from the conduct of public or tribal affairs)?
