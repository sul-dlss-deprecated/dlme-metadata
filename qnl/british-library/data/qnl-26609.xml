Also included is a table of reference for symbols used on the map.The map includes two additional lines: a line in black ink marked 'blue line' (a boundary line that formed part of the non-ratified Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913, and was redefined and adopted in the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of the following year), and a line in pencil outlining the suggested limits of a 'desert zone', which was considered by the British as a possible territorial concession to Saudi Arabia.Another edition of this map can be found at IOR/R/15/2/159, f 246.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Royal Geographical Society</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">publisher</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Bertram Sidney Thomas</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Rubʻ al Khālī </geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100049623112.0x000003#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
