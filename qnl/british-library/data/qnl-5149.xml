I forward herewith, the Arabic original with four certi- fied true copies a^nd translation of a letter, addressed to you, received from the Sultan on the above named subject. 3. It will be seen that the Sultans letter is not the same as the Arabic version of your Draft letter forwarded with your Memorandum No. 64-^3 of 14th January 1937. The Sultan dec lared he preferred to make his own Arabic translation of the English version. His first two attempts, however, were certainly not suitable even allowing for the inevitable changes of form and e xpression which has to take place in rendering one language into another and I had to return them to him with numerous sug gestions. The final result though it is not as close as it could have been to the English draft does, however, I think, include all the essentials and may therefore be accepted. It will be noticed that the English words rt Under Proof 11 have been used in the Sultans letter. The Sultan stated that since these words are technical and have no real equivalent in {Signature) Arabic y L s. 44. ■ (Designation) MFP 1534 S&amp;P—(M.2835)—24-5-38—10,000.- 2 - (&amp;) iS Arabic it would 'be impossible to translate them to give the correct meaning; the only alternative being to use a different expression.

Gentlemen] I; We assemble here today with our friend Sir Trenchard Fcwle, the Resident and -General In Persian Gulf and Pleni potentiary of His Majesty the King of Great Britain to sign the | revised treaty between us and our friend the Great Britain. It is f therefore just opportune to dwel briefly on this Important event. We believe that we are right in saying that most of the people of our country do not know the history of our connections with our friend the Great Britain. It is just possible that some one might surmise that we have convened here today in connection jwith a new thing unknown here-to.f ore. B ut to these we might say that we have assembled in connection with a popular and known originating from a depth of one hundred and forty one years. ,/ The first treaty concluded between our Saldl Government l and the British nation was in .1798 A.D. and in 1800 I.e. after &amp; ■lapse 0 j 2 years another followed. A considerable interval j elapsed in which some treaties necessitated by the circumstances | were concluded . In the year 1839 A.D. i.e. 100 years ago a treaty of Commerce in 15 articles the first of its kind was con- (Cluded between our Great Grand-Grand-father Saiyid Said bin Sultanil 2 - afe the Government of Her Majesty Queen Victoria. This treaty was in force in all tne days of Eaiyid Said bin Sultan as well as in all the days of his predecessor sons until the year 1891 i.e. 48 years ago. In this year of our grand-father Eaiyid Faisal's regime the treaty concluded in Saiyid Said's regime in 1839 was re vised for a period of 12 years. In the year 1910 our grand-father Saiyid Faisal negotiated with the Great Britain for revision of the treaty to keep paces with the requirements of the Government and with the interests of his country, but Saiyid Faisal passed away in 19j. during the negotiation. Then occupied our father the Sultan', year after 2 years since the first revision h in the regime of Saiyid Faisal, our father Saiyid Taimur prolonged the duration of the treaty to a further period of 5 years on completion of which the annual extention was adopted. No changes or additions took places in the treaty as a result of the extention because our father had no suitable oppor tunity to enable him to negotiate for the revision of the treaty, hence it remained as it was in 1891 when Saiyid revised it from the original concluded in the reign of his great grand father Saiyid Said bin Sultan as refered to above. In the year 1S50 2 (1932) of our era our father abdicated in our favour on medical grounds. ^ ^ Ever since we assumed the reign of the country^we have been constantly studying its affairs, bringing to light its requirements the and acquaint ourselves with its interests, thereby fulfilling^duty ^f the position bestowed upon us by the Providence, and guarding the trust(gHs/xS. committed to us ^which may God help us to ■ptain and promote to the best advantages, until ^3%^ suitable oppor- I, _ , tunity iri July 193^enabling us to communicate with the British Government for a revision jsrorontr&lt;1 it b ^If» Our friend the British Government welcomed our communication and in October of the same &lt; xis. year the negotiation for the desired revision of the treaty commenc ed through our friend Major R.P.Watts, His Britanic Majestyts Consul at Muscat. We would like to thank our friend Major Watts for the efforts and keen interests he had displayed in handling the negotiation with goodwill^understanding and friendship. The negotiation continued, and when we and our friend Sir Trenchard Fowle were at London last year, we seized the opportunity to exchange views with the British Government through Sir Tremrhard Fowle,but the negotiation did not end there and had to be taken upa again during the same year at Karachi with Sir Trenchard Fowle.After further exchange of views and agreement of both parties on them the negotiation ended at Karachi. Before we touch on another side of the subject we consider it opportune to express our deep appreciation and thanks to Sir Trenchard Fowle the British Resident and H.B.M T s T.B.M; Consul in Persian Gulf for the efforts,care and attention he| paid toward the negotiation and exchange of views and for bringing the negotiation to its end satisfactorily with true goodwill and affec tion, thereby strengthening the harmonirffi^relation?between us and our friend the Great Britain. This is not only the first assistance Sir Trenchard Fowle has rendered to our Government f but he rendered many valuable timely assistances which our Government shall ever remember with deep appreciation and gratitude• The above is a brief account regarding the original relatioW between our Saidi Government and our friend Great Britain and re garding its^different stages and developxment. The above is a short account about the treaty for which we have assembled here this morning. GentlemenI4. Gentlemen! n , m^Cci You have known from nil thai we have said that the friend- | iy and co-operative relations existing now between our Govrnment and the treat Britain were formed one hundred and forty one years | ago. We mean they were formed in the time of our great grand .grand - I father Salyld Ssxh : Sultan bin Ahmad. You have known also that the j friendly ties between the two Sovetnraents' were improved from time to time^ and the said improvement,may we add now, was done in a com plete concord and understanding.h on thum. You have known also * | that our : ; pno t ie British Government^ has welcomed our negotiatloa | and suggestions for the desired revision of the treaty. It is then |clear that the passing of such a considerable time on the subsistence j of frieridly relations between us and the British Government, the re- j vision and extentlon of these relations done in harmony and goodwill ' in the P ast &gt; the welcome accorded to our negotiation ann^readiness for the exchange of views on the part of our friend the British | Government in our time, all these are distinct proofs of strong friendship and agreement between the two Governments. We are to our friend the British Government for the helps and co operations she had rendered and is still rendering to pur Govern- ment. We should like to mention here that we had had the pleasure, when we were at London as guests of the British Government last ■rear of making personal acqiAntance with His Majesty King George the : sixth an^ many of his distinguished officers. Undoubtedly personal acquaintances and exchange of ideas oii different affairs among mis individuals and Goverment officii are effective instruments to strengthen friendly relations between any two Governments and to promote the desire in them to exchange co-operatiuns to the interestsmm in 6. ■ of their Governments. It Is our belief that our frlenflshlp with the British Government shall more strongly endure. We thank you, Gentlemenl, for your presence In this im portant historical meeting. 1your Highness and Gentlemen, Your Highness has given an interesting resume'^ of the relations between your country and Great Britain for the last century and a half* It is therefore unnecessary for me to dilate on this association any further# I should however like to endorse most heartily vihat Your Highness has expressed so eloquently of the happy relations which have existed over this long period# As Your Highness has pointed out, the Treaty which we are about to sign is no new departure in these relations, but merely a further step in cementing the ties of friendship and interests which bind our two countries. Your Highness has mentioned your visit to England last year, and the happy recollections you have retained of it# I was present in London at that time, and I feel that I can assure Your Highness that all whom you met, both officials and s others, preserve the same happy recollection, and that when Your Highness left England you left many fiiends behind you. With regard to the kind expressions that Your Highness has used concerning that part of the negotiations played by Major Watts and myself, I thank you most sincerely# I cannot let these words pass without expressing ray gratitude for the spirit of co-operation and friendliness displayed by Your Highness which helped so greatly the negotiations which have reached their happy conslusions today# But it was not in these negotiations that relations between Your Highness and myself began# 1 was Consul accredited to the Sultanate when Your / Highness, * *Ii% •»2-» Highness came to the throne 7 years ago and both in that capacity and as Political Resident our relations both official and personal have been of the happiest nature. I have watched with the greatest pleasure and interest the progress of the Sultanate under Your Highness^ rule. In conclusion, on behalf of my Government and myself and all those present, I wish Your Highness long life and happiness and a future full of prosperity for your Sultanate# 1&gt;&lt;?v qc k - u . ol cv P-U- Ko . ^fff lOi 35/86 Telegram ft# From Political Hesident, at Muscat* To Secretary of State for India, London.

Stephenson K- Dunbar, Esq., M.C./3^ Enclosure in foreign Office covering note dated 9th .'February; 1939. pohdiai; op ice; s .w .i 7901 /305/91) 8th February ^ 1959 Dear Stephenson ? r , r ith reference to your letter T 576/46 of the 24th December, regarding the draft Treaty with Muscat P I now send -■ p ■ &amp; H —— —- you a copy of the new Treat;; and copies of the letters exchanged at the tirae 01 the signature of the Treaty. The letter' that refers to Article 15 is confidential and will not he published* The question whether the other letters will he published is under consideration. The Treaty was signed on the 5th February and it is intended to ratify it on the 11th Pebruary. 2. v /e do not think it will be possible to make our new Muscat Order-in-Council until about next May. The practical reasons rendering it impossible to get this Order out simultaneously with the ratification of the Treaty are being explained to the Sultan^ who is being asked to agree that our court in Muscat may operate under the old Order for two or three months longer. 3. The draft Order-in-Council is being'prepared and will have to be sent to the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* At the same time a copy will be sent to the Dominions Office for communication to the Union High Commissionerp with an intimation that we do not t. ink that any changes that may be made in it as a result of the observations of the Government of India or the Political Resident will be such as to be very material from the point of view of the Union Government. As soon as the final draft of the Order-in-Council is readyp we will communicate a copy to the Union Government. It will probably only be possible to/ 'e. Stephenson Ssq. p CVO. &lt;, obe. s Dominions Office.' 3 7 2 - © to do this about the same time as the Order is submitted to the Privy Council and therefore it will he too late to make any alterations then. 4. As regards the High Commissioner's letter of the loth December p it appears that the Union Government ap-ree with the - - —■ ^ ft H I Dominions Office letter of the 14th October except for that part where it was suggested that Muscat might be regarded as standing in a position similar to that of a British protected State. They raise no further objections to the provisions of the Treaty, including the provisions abo\it extraterritorial jurisdictionc, nor do they dissent from the view that the discussions at the Imperial Conference of 1937 only related to the exercise of jurisdiction obtained by Treaty and not to the conclusion of treaties providing for such jurisdiction. Further they admit by implication that in the case of British protected states; including those in the Persian Gulf, we do not have to consult them as regards the terms of our Orders- in-Council or obtain their consent to exercise jurisdiction over Union nationals. They take the view, however, that Muscat stands on a different footing and we admitted that technically it did. Of the two alternative methods of showing that extraterritorial jurisdiction over Union nationals in Muscat would be exercised with the consent of His Majesty's Government in the Union; which were set out in the Dominions Office letter, they adopt the second and submit a draft proclamation. 5. As regards the draft proclamation; we have the following immediate observations to make, while reserving the right to suggest other minor amendments when our own Order is drafted. 6. In Articles 2, 5 and 4 the Union Government have inserted in their proclamation matters which in our case would not be dealt with in the Order-in -Council at all because they do not affect/13% ( 3. affect the action of our court. Those matters would simply Idg left on the loasis of the treaty P and we would suggest that it would 'be more appropriate and correct that the Union proclamationthe ohject of which is to sanction the exercise of jurisdiction 'by our courts over Union nationals 5 should only deal wi oh matters which actually af fect the consular 1 court and that therefore Articles 2, 3 and 4 should he omitted. 7. Article 2 deals with the position in the Sultan's court where we have a treaty right, the substance of which is reproduced in this Article. V/e should claim the observance of this treaty right, but we cannot enforce it or add to its validity in any way by issuing legislative provisions of our own. 8. Similarly^ Article 3 deals with the action of the Sultan of Muscat's police and substantially the same comment applies. 9. Article 4 deals with what was an undertaking by both parties to the Treaty as to the manner in which they will exercise their jurisdiction. It is hardly a provision which can be enacted legislatively in this way and we should not put it in our Order-in-Council. 10. Similar reasoning suggests that in the preamble of the draft proclamation ? the words 11 and certain further privileges have also been accorded'' at the end of paragraph 1 should be omitted and that the beginning of paragraph 3 of the preamble should read ''And whereas it is desirable that Union nationals should be rendered subject to the jurisdiction etc.' 1 11 • In paragraph 2 of the preamblethe penultimate line wouldp we thinkp read better if it said u ... representativesp over all His Majesty's subjects within the territories of His Highness. 14 Yours sincerely? 3d, H.

Sir, I am directed to address you on the above subject. 2. As you ar^aware, negotiations have recently been in progress between His Majesty's Government and the Sultan of Muscat regarding the revision of the Anglo-Muscat Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation of 1891, which is ordinarily due to expire iriPebruary 1939. In connection with the drafting of a new treaty it has been agreed to by His Majesty's Government after consultation with the Government of India that the following Article should be inserted in' the treaty 'The Sultan's Government has the right to charge all vessels entering any of the ports in the sultan s dominions with shipping, tonnage or harbour dues to be administered under the control of a special board appointed by the Sultan for improvement of the harbour and construction and maintenance of light houses, etcetera'. At the same time, the Sultan of Muscat has expressed his willingness to agree, by an exchange of letters, inter alia - (a)^ — - ...» (a) tiriat the dues levied at each port in his. dominions should be on a scale comensurate with the expenditure incurred on the harbour and light facilities at that port, and (b) that the special Board which will be presided over by the Sultan's Port Authority should consist of Omni and British members in equal numbers. Furtner, in so far as the ligbts in Omani i/yaters are concerned, in view of the fact that they are being maintained by the Pers%(a) Gulf Lighting Service Fund, the Sultan has agreed that a contribution will be paid to the Fund from the revenue derived under the above Article towards the maintenance of these lights. As, however, the levy of the proposed dues by his Government will increase the total amount levied from shipping in the Persian Gulf, the Sultan desired an aasurance to be given that the rate of lightdues levied in the Gulf would be reduced in proportion to the reduction in the present cost of the lighting service brought about by the contemplated arrargements.-After a careful examination of the matter the Government of India felt that there was no objectioryfco the request of the Sultan being complied with, and they have authorised that the assurance asked for may be given. 3. I am to request that the matter may be reported to the Persian Gulf Lighting Service Advisory Oommittee for their information, I have, etc., Sd/- A. N.

Sir, 7^ With his despatch No. 1758 (1062/5/35) of the 19th December* 1935&gt; Sir George Clerk transmitted a copy of a note from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs in which the Ministry asked that a more clearly worded reply might be obtained from the Sultan of Muscat in answer to His Majesty's Government's note of the 16th June, 1933, concerning the modification of the Muscat Tariff. 2. The draft supplementary notes v/hich His Majesty's G-overnment proposed to instruct the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to arrange to exchange with the Sultan of Muscat were sent to Sir George Clerk under cover of Mr. Sden f s \ko despatch No. 731 of the 21st April, 1936, for the approval of the French Government, and, subsequently, Sir George Clerk with his despatch No. 617 (514.1/i4./36) of the 9th May transmitted a copy or a note from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs concurring in the proposed texts. 3. It has not been possible, until quite recently, to obtain the necessary letter from the Sultan of Muscat, but I now enclose, for transmission to the French Government, a '■ , ' r- 1 '' iui - ^ certified copy of the Arabic original of a letter addressed to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf by the Sultan ——— T ll ,,, . ,^ b • {1 ^' v together with a certified copy of an English translation, copy of this translation is also enclosed for retention in His Majesty's Embassy. The delay which has occurred has been occasioned by A-i2&gt;- the fact that an earlier letter, written in 1937? in which the Sultan attempted to meet the French Governmant'^ wishes, did not/ Excellency The Right Honourable Sir Eric Phipps, G.G .M .G. , G.G.V.O., etc., etc., etc., Paris.!1 V 2 not bring out the exact points which they required to he made, and it was necessary to obtain an amended version; the prolonged absences of the Sultan from his capital have also caused further delays. -HI 5* with regard to the letter herewith transmitted it should be observed that it still contains one defect. By inserting the words 'by the existing Treaty' in the second reservation the Sultan has made it appear as if the second reservation applied only to that part of the first reservation which concerns United States vessels, since the Netherlands Government, although their ,, most~favoured-nation ,, treatment does, in fact, derive from a Treaty right, are not mentioned as enjoying a Treaty right in the wording of the first reservation. It seems unnecessary, however, to suppose that this is due to any desire on the Sultan's part to evade the wishes of the French Government rather than to his known difficulty in dealing with this rather complicated question. 6. It will be noticed that the Snglish words 'under proof' have been employed in the Sultan's letter. There is no real equivalent for this technical phrase in Arabic, and the French ^ We p TULtjdL ^ Government in their note of the 18th December, 1935&gt; declared themselves satisfied with the explanation furnished on this point by the letter ch, 1935&gt; from the Sultan of Muscat.

The Proclamation did not however mean that the Union Government had acceded to the Treaty and no intimation has as yet been received from that Government of their desire to do so - (this would in any case be effected under the provisions of Article 20, and not by the extension of the Treaty to the Union under Article 19).
