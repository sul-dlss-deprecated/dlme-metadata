We have been looking at the correspondence enclosed in India Office letter P.Z.4379/37 of the 7th July on the subject of the Saudi Arabian-Muscat frontier. 2. We do not know whether you have yet considered what reply, if any, should be sent to the Sultan of Muscat’s letter of 4th May to Watts, in which he makes it known to His Majesty’s Government that he will have no objection to recognising the Eastern limits of King Ibn Baud’s territory as being defined by the line joining the points C,D,E,G,H, and I. 3. But we think, subject to your views, that it might be as well if a communication were addressed to the Sultan mentioning, inter alia , that His Majesty’s Government have taken note of the fact that while he cannot state precisely the limits of his claims, he at any rate lays no claim to any territory beyond the points D,E,G, and H (the points G and M.J. Clauson, Esq. 5 '3'and I do not really affect him). This will serve to narrow down any controversy which might possibly arise when, and if, the new oil concession recently granted to Petroleum Concessions Limited comes to be exploited, and may help us to secure an eventual definition of the inland boundary of the Sultanate. 4. Incidentally, the use of letters of the alphabet for describing potential frontiers is convenient enough in its way, but if the same letter is used at different times for different geographical points owing to changes in the suggested frontier line, the letters are apt to become a source of confusion. We therefore suggest that these points should be fixed in their present positions through definitions based on the intersection of their co-ordinates e. g. *C = intersection of 52° E and 23° N r\ _ tt t» RAO oon lowing to the changed position of Sufuk the position of the present point C may be moved further North East to a point which might when determined be lettered e. g.J. D E G H r» ' 55° 40'E &amp; 22° N ' 55° E &amp; 20° N ' 52° E &amp; 19° N andand that if it is necessary hereafter to alter the positions of any of these points the new positions should be indicated by new letters altogether. 5. I mention this point here because in the present case it would be desirable in any communication to the Sultan to define D f E,G, and H in some way and the simplest way is to give their co-ordinates.MintNotes.

Result of the discussions with the Sultan of Muscat may be summarised as follows;*' (i) The Sultan has agreed to accept the suggested line joining points C-D-E-G-H (the relevant map is placed on top of the file) as &amp;. boundary line of Ibn Saud’s dominions. 4136b 1000 10.35 (ii)/(ii) He has refused to consider the extension of this line either to the east (towards meridian 56°) or to the south. (iii) He has refused to define the western boundaries of his own State*; that is^he has not committed himself to a claim of effective control over the whole desert area on the Muscat side of the line C-D-E-G-H. It is the opinion of the Political Resident that it will be impossible to obtain from him a definite statement on this point. It is to be noted that the Political Resident / , in approving Sir Reader Bullard’s suggestion ^(telegram No. 630 - P.Z.4175*) understood it to involve a brief visit to the area in question, perhaps by air, not a joint * topographical mission 1 such as is now suggested (cf. his telegram No. 677 - P.Z.4324). In his earlier telegram he also suggested that a representative of Qatar should take part. (Sd.) H.A.N. Barlow. 12.7.37 It will be seen from the Minutes that it was felt by the Middle East (official) Sub Committee that it would be useless to the Eastern and North Eastern frontier question further with Ibn Saud at the present time, since he is clearly unwilling to compromise. The only circumstances in which a definitely fixed frontier would be essential would be the development of oil exploration in the disputed area south of Qatar and Abu Dhabi. There is no immediate prospect of this happening, and we shall have good warning before it does. We can therefore leave the frontier question dormant without regret. The idea of a ’*topographical mission” is merely/Minute Paper. Department. © 6ah} ^ G)o&gt;taA merely a device for passing the time and keeping Ibn Saud happy.

TICS C-AIPifAT drcv/ attention to Sir Reader Bullard's viev/ that it was not desirable to press Ibn Saud to come tc a settlement on the frontier question at the present moment. 'As he understood the position Sir Reader's impression was that Ihn Saud was not taking much interest in the eastern and Southern Arabian frontiers, and that-2- the question might well he left in abeyance subject to one important proviso; viZt , that no activities in ccnnectior with oil development intervened,. MR* EENLEL confirmed that Ibn Sand was showing no readiness to reach agreement on this question and would probably prefer to leave it in abeyance* As regards oil he had circulated a note of a conversation between himself and Mr 0 Longrigg, cf Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., (paper Noe Ivh 5,(0) 234). It was difficult to icre see what the action of the Oil Companies would be. It was quite possible that if the Standard Oil Company of California struck paying quantities of oil at Hasa, Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., would be more eager to start work at Qatar, If however the Companies decided to prospect and drill in the most favourable area, i. e. , South West of Qatar, we might be faced with an awkward situation if the frontier question remained unsettled, THE CHAIRhAlT said he would like to hear the views of the Sub-Committee on Sir Reader Bullard’s attitude. If Ibn Saud was not Interested at the moment, it might be best to fall in with Sir Reader’s view. CAPTAIN PHILLIPS said the Admiralty were not particularly interested in this problem, but they were impressed by Sir Reader Bullard’s view, and it was for consideration as to the extent to which his proposal could be applied. In the Southern and Eastern areas it seemed that this could be done without difficulty, but this was not so in the North. The possibilities of oil in the area South of Qatar were not apparently known, and the settlement cf the frontier question in that area would probably have to be settled as and when the occasion arose. The Admiralty considered that in the interim it might be possible to establish certain- 3 - facts with Ibn Saud such as the location of important physical features in the area^ MRc said that a disquieting feature of the situation was that Ihn Saud new appeared more reluctant than he had been in April, 1935, to reach a settlement or tc abandon certain shadowy claims to overlordship ever the Trucial States* As a result of developments in regard tc the Palestine situation Ibn Saud now felt that he was regarded as a champion of the Arab cause, and that if he reached any agreement with his Majesty’s Government which could be represented as signing away to the British any territory in Arabia, he would be accused by his own people of giving away Arab territory to the foreigner and betraying the Arab cause. It was true that he had, by Article 6 of rhe Treaty of Jedda, recognised our special Treaty relations with the Arab rulers. But he now seemed to be taking the line that this did not preclude him from retaining a kind of suzerainty over them and did not oblige him to recognise any particular frontier as marking the limit of his own rights, MR. CLAUSON said there were two points regarding the likelihood of oil developments. In the first place he thought that Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., who had been helped by many Government Departments, felt they were under some obligation to His Majesty's Government, and he did not consider that the Company would reach a stage in oil development which would be embarrassing tc His Majesty’s Government without giving us ample notice and leaving us time tc take any appropriate steps. He did not think that His Majesty’s Government would be in any danger of not being able to delay oil activities in the disputed areas. In the second place Petroleum Concessions, Ltd,, had a good deal of work on hand, and Mr. Longrigg had recently/ informed him that they thought they had got concession from the. Sultan of Muscat,, There had also heen very considerable work on the Trucial Coast, along the Red Sea and at Aden, and he did not think they were in any hurry to develop any particular portion of their concerns* The India Office view was that the frontier problem was not affected by any imediate urgency in regard to oil developments* In reply to a question by the Chairman, regarding the possibility of American concerns exploiting their interests through Saudi-Arabia, he said that the India Office view was that the Standard Oil Company of California at present showed every desire not to do anything to bring them in conflict with His Majesty’s Government, THE CHAIRMAN considered that the India Office view regarding oil developments should carry weight in consideration of the frontier problems, as that Department was responsible for the Persian Gulf sheikdoms. In reply to a question by Mr* Hale as to whether Petroleum Concessions, Ltd,, was a subsidiary of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, MR. RENDEL explained that Petroleum Concessions, Ltd. , which was merely the Iraq Petroleum Company under another form, was, like the latter, an international concern which, although registered in this country, contained a 23.75 American interest, a 23*75 French interest, and a 5^ independent private interest (Mr. Gulbenkian’s). While it was true that the Company would probably not wish to quarrel with His Majesty’s Government, it would be a mistake to assume that it was under cur complete control, and it would be difficult for it, in view of the foreign interests in it, to refrain from exploiting profitable oil resources. He was not sure whether we had a strong enough case successfully to bring - 4 -1 pressure to 'bear upon it to refrain from exploiting any particular area? such as the Jebel Naksh, which was included in the area shown on the map attached to its concession as falling within that concession. TH7.v CHAIRMAN considered that in the event of such a stage being reached? the time would come for a unilateral declaration by His Majesty’s Government, laying down their views on the frontier, but he did not consider that such a declaration was requisite at the moment, and it was certainly not desirable (if it w r as not really necessary), in view of the approaching issue of the Palestine Report. He suggested that the Sub-Coi/mi11ee should assume that the situation did not warrant a unilateral declaration at present, and consider what interim action should be taken in regard to the frontier problem* MRo RHITDEL said that he had no constructive suggestions to put forward but he considered that the action suggested by Sir Reader Bullard in para, 7 of his despatch No. 47, and endorsed by Captain Phillips earlier in the meeting,-i.e. , that we should endeavour to establish the geographical facts t in co-operation with Ibn Saud - might be worth pursuing. He felt that inaction might be dangerous, as it might end in our case going by default, while Ibn Saud would meanwhile almost certainly extend his influence over the tribes in the territory concerned, so that in a few years we might easily find that his influence had been increased and that more tribes owed allegiance to him than at present. THE CHAIRMAN thought that it would be some time before w r e could say what the frontier actually was, but in the meantime an enquiry could be made with a view to the sett lenient of certain recognised doubtful points. - 5 -MR. RENDEL said that in March we had gone all out for a settlement and made it clear that we attached importance to reaching one. But Ihn Saud had not agreed to our proposalc. He was not happy at leaving the situation like that, and it might be possible to consider the despatch of a note to Ibn Saud, suggesting a joint survey of the area in dispute, such a survey to cover the area Dohat-Es-Salwa to Sufuk ‘/ells. he would however like Sir Reader Bullard’s views on this suggestion. MAJOR hlChOL-SOh said that the War Office would be quite agreeable to this procedure, provided our oil interests were safeguarded. A discussion as to the possibility of carrying out a joint survey of the area under dispute ensued. CAPTAIN HEAP said that from the technical point of view there would be no difficulty in carrying out the proposed survey, provided permission from the Government and the tribes concerned was obtained. MR. REItDEL considered that we should not get the required permission unless the Saudis were represented on the survey, although he did not think they had any qualified technical personnel. MR. KALE pointed out that before a decision was reached we should frame an estimate of the cost of the survey. HEAP explained that a thorough survey would take from 6 months to a year to complete, but if a sketch on the lines of those given in the books by Mr. Philby and Mr. Bertram Thomas would be considered satisfactory it would be completed in a month.— 7 — WRo RETOOL oon 3 iderecl that such a sketch would hs satisfactory for political purposes, and considered that a scheme should he worked cut for a survey involving two surveyors and their assistants over a period of two months^ A straightforward proposition to this end could he put l to Ihn Saud, THE GKAIRI.AN summarised the discussion, and said that as regards interim action a proposal should he put to Ihn Saud for a joint topographical mission to establish certain physical features in the Dohat-Es-Salwa - Sufuk areao He considered that the details of this scheme should he worked out hy representatives of the Foreign Office? India Office, War Office and Air Ministry, and an estimate of cost prepared for submission to the Treasury. This was agreed to, and CAPTAIN PHILLIPS pointed out that it was essential that the mission should produce an agreed sketch map which should contain more accurate detail than existed in any of the present maps. THE CHAIRI-iAN then raised the question of the grant of oil royalties to King Ihn Saud suggested in paragraph 7 of Sir Reader Bullard’s despatch of the 27th March, 1937, (Paper No. M. N. (0) 227). MR. RLNDEL considered Sir R&lt; Bullard’s point to he that Ihn Saud’s interest in the Jehel Naksh was mainly due to a suspicion that oil might he found there. Ihn Saud desperately needed new resources, and if he could obtain any oil royalties it might make all the difference to the stability of his kingdom. From the international political point of view, it was very much to the interest of His Majesty’s Government that Saudi Arabia should he strong and independent. If, then, the grant to Ihn Saud, as part of a frontier settlement, of a share in any oil royalties derivingfrom the Jebel Naksh could he arranged, it might he a wise move from the political point of view* It would he remembered that a similar arrangement had heen concluded with Turkey at the time of the Treaty of Angora, 1926, when the Turco*-Iraq.i frontier had heen settled, and Turkey had heen given a share of the Iraqi oil royalties,, MR. CLAUSON said the India Office agreed with the Foreign Office view as to the necessity for a stable Saudi—Arahiae As regards the particular proposition that Ihn Saud should he given a share in the oil profits from Qatar, the India Office felt that payment uO Ihn Saud, if any* should he made by His Majesty’s Government and the profits obtained by the Sheikh of Qatar under a concession approved by His Majesty's Government should not he taken away from himo THE CHAIRMAN said it appeared that the question of oil royalties should he held in abeyance and should only he taken up as part of a general bargain with Ihn Saudo CAPTAIN PHILLIPS said that the Admiralty considered that as part of a general bargain there was much to reconmend the question of oil royalties; and it might he a reasonable solution of what otherwise looked like an insoluble problem,, THE CHAIRMAN suggested that whilst it was clearly impossible for His Majesty’s Government to contemplate making any grant themselves, the matter should he held in abeyance, pending the time when a frontier settlement was being discussed by His Majesty's Government and Ibn Saud* This was agreed to* THE CHAIRMAN said that the remaining question for consideration was the question of the boundary between Saudi-Arabia and the Aden Protectorate which was dealt with in Paper No® M. E* (o) 229o — 8 -- 9 - \ MRo COWELL explained that Sir Bernard Reilly’s despatch of 24th March&gt; 1937 p put forward the maximum possible concession to Ibn Saud* The Colonial Office would much prefer to postpone consideration of this part of the frontier for the present* A special political officer had been appointed in this area, and was acquiring a greatly increased knowledge# In a year or so’s time we should be in a much stronger position to state our claim in this area# MR# REI1DEL agreed that time was much more on our side in the Southern portion of the frontier than in the Northern area, and that the fact that we were now actively developing our influence over the Northern Areas of the Aden Protectorate and collecting new information about the situation there was a strong argument against any premature attempt to force a settlement by means, for example, of a unilateral declaration. TNE CHAIRMAN suggested that the Committee should take note of Sir Bernard Reilly’s views on the boundary between Saudi-Arabia and the Aden Protectorate, and that so far as this part of the boundary was concerned there might even be an advantage in deferring delimitation. This was agreed to# MR, RE TIDE L referred to the impending vacation of the Chairmanship of the Sub-Coiiiaittee by Sir Cosmo Parkinson, and on behalf of the Sub-Coi.i.iittee expressed their gratuities to Sir Cosmo for the help he had given them during the many years he had been Chairman. SIR COSMO PARKINSON thanked Mr. Rendel for his remarks and said he was very sorry to be leaving the Sub-Committee#CONCLUSIONS. THE SUB-COMHITTEE agreed - (i) To recommend acceptance of the view of His Majesty’s Minister at ''edda (Paper No. M.E.O. 227) that, for the present, 4 it is not desirable to press King Ibn Sard to come to a settlement of the outstanding questions regarding the eastern and southern boundaries of Saudi Arabia, on the understanding that, should the Oil Companies concerned decide to prospect in any of the areas under dispute, it will be necessary to consider the question of a unilateral declaration being made by His Majesty’s Government to King Ibn Saud, in which they would state the frontier which they propose to observe. As an interim measure to prevent the claim of His Majesty’s Government going by default, a reply should be sent to King Ibn ^aud (provided that His Majesty’s Minister at .’’edda still considers this desirable) su estin th1 a jo int Anglo— Saudi-Arabian Topographical Mission should be despatched to the area south of ,atar, in order to establish accurately the geographical position of important features in that area. (ii) (’ i) efore His ! h? jesty’ s Government is co r -mitted to such a Mission, the Moreign Office, Jndla Office, ‘V'ar Office and dir Ministry should worb out the detailed recuirements and prepare an estimate of tne probable cost for consideration by the Treasury. (iv) .The suggestion of F is Majesty's Minister at Jedda (Paper No. ! .1.(0) 227 ; that King Ibn Saud might perhaps be given part of the royalties on oil struck in or near Hebei .Hacsh would require consideration only as part of a bargain for the settlement of the boundary and should remain in abeyance for the time being: meanwhile it was noted that the India Office saw objection to pressing the Vh Sheikh oi Qatar to give up any id art of royalties to which he was entitled under concessions ^hich had been anproved by His Majesty's Government, but it seemed clear that His Majesty’s Goverament could not contemplate 5ritish fund s. making any grant from it V (v) •Whitehall Gardens,S. . 1. 29th June. 1937.

Reference correspondence ending with your telegram No.t/ 5 of March 5th. 2. I took up this matter with the Sultan on the first opportunity after my return to Muscat. As 1 expected I found that he was still not prepared to state what were the western limits of his territory* He repeated what he had already said in his letter of 15th May 1936 ( forwarded to you under my Express letter C-71 of 10th June 1936) that to give a clear definition of his boundaries and of his interests and claims in the areas effected was $ matter of extreme difficulty for him inasmuch as such a thing had never been previously done. He said that he had, since I first approached him in this connection at Dhofar, been making inquiries to obtain informa tion on which to work out his land boundary but declared that it would still require a considerable time to complete this. 3. In my opinion if he can possibly avoid it the Sultan will not commit himself to a definite boundary on the land side of his State. In addition to certain difficulties attendant upon such an undertaking for instance lack of natural geographi cal features which c ould be used as descriptive points, the absence /absence of records etc*, a good deal of rather troublesome work would have to be carried out which no Muscat official would ever willingly do. 4. In order to try and get the Sultan to come to a decision regarding his attitude on the various proposed boundaries to be offered to Ibn Saud as the eastern limits of his domains I had plotted and drawn out on a map the line joining the points mentioned in my letter to him No.C/65 dated Dhofar 25th April 1936 (copy sent you under my Express Letter of 10th June 3Jo*0-7l). This map I gave to the Sultan who took it away with him and promised to let me have a reply shortly as regards this particular question. I think he will agree to accept as unobjectionable from the Muscat Government’s point of view an eastern boundary for Ibn Saud defined by a line joining the points C.D.E.G.H. and I* 5. This boundary question seems to have alarmed the Sultan especially now that oil concessions are H in the air w and he appears more reluctant to commit himself each t irae the subject is brought up. I hope however shortly to be able to persuade him to agree to the line mentioned in paragraph 4 above. -POLITICAL.Confident ial« EXPRESS LETTER • Prom Polit leal Muscat. To Brit consul Bushire.

THE PALACE, Muscat, 11th May 1937. prom - Said bin Taimur. To - Our Friend Major R.P.Watts, the British Consul at Muscat. After Compliments, ^Vith reference to your letter dated the 25th April 1936, and our reply thereto dated Dhoffar the 24th Safar 1355, and the verbal conversation which took place between us and you on our visit to you a few days ago. Further to what has already been said, and having perused the map which we have taken from you, we would now reply that f so far as Muscat interests and claims would be involved, we would have no objection if the eastern limits of the territory belonging to H.M.King Abdul Aziz bin 3aud were recognised as being defined by a line joinirg the points C.D.E.G.H. and I marked on the map you gave us and which were defined in paragraph 4 of your above mentioned letter. This line, it is understood, would be so drawn as to give Ramalat Mughshin to Muscat and Sabkhat Majora to Sa’udi Arabia. As for the enquiry in paragraph 5 of your letter as to whether we consider that Muscat interests would be adversely affected if (a) the proposed line between points G. and H. were taken further to the South and (b) the Eastern sector of the line between the points G. and J. were taken to meridian 56, we consider that both (a) and (b) would affect our interests adversely and we do pot agree to either of them. What we have stated above is our final reply in this connection. We request, therefore, that this be submitted to our friend the Brit ish Government. We thank the British Government for the trouble they have taken in this matter which concerns the interests of our Government. We would be grateful if, when negotiationswith H*M # King Abdul Aziz in connection with these boundaries come to an end, the Government would send us a document signed by H.M.King Abdul Aziz for record in our office# Your sincere friend, sd.

Question of South-Nastern frontiers was considered by Middle Last Official Sub—Committee on June 29th. It was agreed that suggestion for unilateral declaration by His Majesty's Government need not be pursued, at any rate unless and until it is known that oil companies have decided to start oil prospecting and exploitation in neighbourhood of disputed areas. 2. Meanwhile His ¥iajesty's Government agree with view expressed in paragraph 7 of your despat ch No .47 [of March 27th] that it might be dangerous to allow question to go by default, particularly as regards Northern sector, and they are therefore inclined to adopt your proposal for a communication to Ibn Saud suggesting joint survey of disputed area. While detailed and accurate survey would be long and expensive proceeding, there seems no reason why a rough topographical enquiry and report, accompanied by an accurate sketch map showing main features in their correct positions, should not be produced. This need not take many months. It would probably be necessary, however, to insist on inclusion of representative of heikh of Qatar in the party. 5. If you consider it desirable, you may speak to Ibn Saud in this sense or leave it until later, when it may be possible to put forward more detailed proposal. 4. as regards Southern sector of frontier. His majesty's Government consider that balance of advantage lies in leaving matter in abeyance for the present.

Sheikh of Qatar will certainly not relinquish his rights to his royalty from the Company. The only way, therefore, for out suggestion to be carried/would be for His Majesty*s Government to make payment.The attached papers relate to a meeting on Tuesday next, the 29th June, regarding the Eastern and South- Department. * Sastern boundaries of Saudi-Arabia. When this matter was last under consideration early this year, it was agreed that Mr. Rendel of the Eastern Department of the Foreign Off ice,who was shortly starting on an unofficial tour of the Middle East, should take the opportunity of Gulf the question whether it was possible, without encroaching on the legitimate claims of the Persian Gulf rulers, to offer some compromise in respect of the boundaries between Saudi-Arabia and the territories of Bahrein, and actually flew over the territory (Jebel Nak and Khor-al-Odeid) principally in dispute. He came to the conclusion that there was really nothing more that could be offered to Ibn Saud, and in the conversations which he had with the King at Jedda in March, he endeavoured to persuade His Majesty to accept a settlement which would leave Jebel Haksh and Khor-al-Odeid outside Saudi- Arabia. He unfortunately failed to do so and he further got the impression that the King was not really anxious for a settlement of the boundary question. We are accordingly faced with a deadlock, and it will be for the Committee to consider what, if anything, can be done next. The views of H.M. Minister are given in paras. 6 and 7 of his despatch, dated March 27th. He feels that no progress is likely to be made by further arguments at Jedda, and that the best we can do for the 4.37 ioi* present/ discussing with the Political Officers in the Persian with the Political Resident and the Political Agent, reached with Ibn Saud. Mr. Rendel discussed the matter these rulers, which would enable a settlement to be K0G3 Wt 9696/P 28 5000present is to suggest that a Joint Commission might visit ! the area principally under dispute and examine the physical features on the spot. He also suggests that the question of giving the Saudi Government some royalty on any oil vhich may eventually he extracted from the Jehel haksh area by Petroleum Concessions Limited, the Qatar Concessionaires, should be carefully considered. The Political Resident has been asked for his views on these two points and, subject to his observations, there seems idr ttu‘fxAihjifiut no objection to givinn®*5» sympathetic consideration. , l*id to dtftyitUiUi ' The above deals with the - northerly end of the . Frontier. As regards the next portion of the Frontier, i.e. that opposite Muscat, it does not appear that Ibn Saud is much concerned. In any case, no progress can be made at the moment since, owing to the Sultan of Muscat’s prolonged absence in the interior, we have not yet had a detailed report from the Political authorities in the Persian Gulf regarding his views on the precise alignment of his Frontier. The Sultan has shown a very intelligible reluctance to get down to this question, which is probably not one of any great importance from the oil point of view since the territory in question is mostly inaccessible desert. The third portion of the Frontier, i.e. the southern portion opposite the Aden Protectorate and the Hadramaut is of course, a matter primarily for the Colonial Office, but so far as one can see, it is unlikely that any compromise will be possible with Ibn Saud over this area either. It seems probable, therefore, that the meeting on Tuesday will not detcgfriifpc any very conclusive recommendations. Its main object, no doubt, will be to talk round the subject in the light of whatever Mr. Rendel may have to say as a result of his personal contacts during his unofficial tour. The probable inability to do anything to meet Ibn S aud/Department. 3. Seud in regard to the Frontier question makes it additionally important to meet him in other questions if it is at all possible to do so. One of the most important of these is, of course, the question of . supplying him with arms and ammunition, which is the subject of a separate note. The meeting may perhaps touch on this question, and if so, it is proposed to support the Foreign Office who are, of course, particularly anxious to do anything possible for Ibn Saud in this respect. r i(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAHHIC IHVJESTY' 3 GOVERI'RvIEHT).

Sir, With reference to my telegram No.84 of ^pril 6 th, I have the honour to forward a translation of the statement which Fuad Bey Hamza handed to me on April 3rd regarding the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. As the text is not very clear in certain places I enclose also a copy of the original. 2 . I am unable to identify several of the places named in the statement under head 1 . Most of them would appear to be particular portions of the system known under the general name of Qala'il. This is shown in the maps and is described in Philby 'The Empty Quarter' p.50 as 'the long escarpment of Qala'il. which forms the westward face of the Qatar plateau'. I doubt whether the portions of it named in the Saudi statement will be found in any map. I gather that the Saudi Government have relied on tribesmen for some of their information. 3 . Otherwise the statement is pretty clear so far ac it goes, except for the repeated use of a word which, according to my interpreter, manes 'parallel'. When it is applied to coordinates, it obviously means only that the line follows the parallels of latitude and the meridians but in other v places the sense may be more doubtful. 4 ./ The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G etc. , etc . 1 ., etc .

The Government of the Saudi Arab Kingdom consider that the frontier line which divides them and the Amirate of Y.atar passes through the following places The said line begins at a point on the coast of the sea known as Oohat Salva and follows (literally, runs parallel to) a line extending from the junction of Jebel Dukhan and the neighbouring territory in a western direction leaving the area (literally distance) which is situated on its west and which is located between Jebel Dukhan and Jebel An-Nakhsh to the Saudi Arab Kingdom, and Jebel Dukhan and what is behind it on the east to Qatar. The line then turns to the south and the south-east parallel to the slope of the eastern Qala’il (? eastern slope of the Qala f il), leaving the Qala’il known as Qalalat Ad-Darb, Mashash As-Samim, Al-Mafsal, Al-Maghdar, At-Ta f z, Um-Samra , Ariq-Kashash Ibn-Shafi and the territory situated to the west thereof known as *riq and Qala’il to the Saudi Arab Kingdom, and those to the east of this line to Qatar. The line then extends from Mashash Ibn-Shdfi to Al-’Aql as far as to the coast of the sea leaving Naqiyan Qatar to Qatar and the Khor A 1 'Odeid to the Saudi Arab Kingdom. 2. The Government of the Saudi Arab Kingdom consider also that the said f ontier line which divides them and the Arab A::*irates and Sheykhdoms situated on the Persian Gulf/Gulf runs through the following places: The said line begins at a place cm the sea coast 25 kilometres distant from the Khor A1 ’Cdeid and extends to the south and south-east parallel to the lands known as Majann, Sabakhat-ilatti and Kufat al-Liwa leaving the lands belonging to Kufat al-Liwa to the Arab Amirates and those to the west to the Saudi Arab Kingdom. 3. The said line runs from the limits of the territory of Kufat al-Liwa as far as the intersection of Meridian 56 degrees Last with Parallel 22 degrees North and it then follows (literally, runs parallel to) Meridian 56 degrees Last as far as the point where it meets Parallel 19 degrees North. It then goes direct until it comes to the intersection of Parallel 17 degrees North with Meridian 52 degrees Ji.ast and then goes direct in the western direction along (literally, parallel to) Parallel 17 degrees North until it cuts the line known as the violet line.ADEN, SECRET Downing Street ? 4th March, 1937. Sir 7 I have the honour to refer to your telegram No ,6 of the 12th of January, and to previous telegraphic correspondence, and to inform you that the question of the eastern and south-eastern boundaries of Saudi-Arabia has recentlj' formed the subject of further discussion by the Departments concerned. 2. His Majesty f s Government have reached the conclusion that, in view of certain important Imperial and international considerations which are brieflv set out below, it is desirable that every endeavour should be made to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the question of these disputed frontiers. 3. In the firs + place the contingency must be envisaged that the report of the Royal Commission on Palestine and the subsequent decisions of His Majesty's Government will not give general satisfaction to the peop3e of Palestine, and that as a consequence there may be a recrudescence of disorder in that country on a more serious scale than has hitherto been experienced. Moreover, it is likely that the effects of such developments, in so far as they arise from Arab opposition, would not be confined to Palestine alone, but that the relations of His Majesty’s Government with the independent Arab States throughout Arabia would be adversely affected; and there is the obvious THE RESIDENT AT ADEN.- 2 - possibility th^.t Italian activities in Arabia /'S would be directed ^ in such an event to v/idening the breach. It is of importance that no unnecessary strain should be placed upon the relations between Kis Majesty’s Government and the Government of Saudi“Arabia at such a critical time; and the conclusion of a friendly agreement in this frontier dispute should appreciably improve those relations. 4 . In these circumstances 3 it has been suggested that the position of the frontier negoti?lions should be reviewed $ and that consideration should be given to the question whether some further concession cannot be made towards meeting F-ing rbn Sand s claims both in the more northern area, and in the Aden Protectorate zone. So far as the Protectorsde is concerned $ I shall be obliged if you ^'ill consider whether 9 in the light of this despatch 5 some additional concession might not be m- de in the area between parallels 17 and 1 0 ' 9 particularly to the west Ox meridian 51. It is desirable that the question should be examined from the point of view of the limits of the area over which our tribes have indubitable claims 9 rather than with a view to the exclusion of King ibn Saud from districts of T 'hich the ownership is quite indeterminate. It is realised tha.t the cession of any prt of the territory to the north of the Kedramaut would mean some diminution in the desert area which separates the Protectorate from foreign territory«, and on the retention of which great importance has been laid in t:e past. Nevertheless I feel that the special considerations mentioned above justify me in asking you once again to review the position andreport whether some further concession can be made m Protectorate zone without sacrificing xOCc^l intci^^uo, I have etc, (Signed) W. OPivISBY-GCRE.I COPY . SECRET. i 1 O # JL o O ® B. THE RESIDENCY, ABEIT. 24th Earoh, 1937. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your secret despatch dated 4tn narca, 1937 in which you direct me once again to review c; e position regarding the question of the 'boundary ooovveen Sa’uai Arabia and tne Aden Protectorate, and to report whet.ier so;.;e furf er concessions can be made in the Protectorate zones without sacrificing local interests. 2 . I have consulted Kr. Ingrams, First Political Officer, who is now on special duty in the eastern part of the Protector go, and wno, as you are aware, has made a special anci careful study of the tribes in the Hadhrnmaut district, uis hnowledge of then has been augmented by the personal contact t at ne has had with them during his stay for the last five monti s in the hadhramaut, where he has been actively enr iged in assisting the local tribes to join in a general truce, tne corn of which emphasises their dependence on the Qu aiti n^d ^atniri Buitans. The tribes occupying the area af^ecoed c t v one question of the northern boundary with King Ibn Sa’ud are (from west to east) the Seia’r, the Awamir, the hanahil and the hahra. Of these Seia’r and Manahil are dope .denos oi one lu aiti Sultan and the former are also closel t/ allied u’ith the Kathiri^ the Awamir are part of the Shenafir confederation of which the Kathiri Sultan is the head; und ^he i.ai.ra oelong to txie Sultanate of Qishn and. Socotra. In addition to the four tribes mentioned there are outlying sections of the Kathiris living among the Mahras in the neighbourhood of Sanau and Thamut, about 150 miles to w. e norm e '•.st of t/:.e .’ladhramaut Valley. -4-- 5 “ accordance v/itli t.\e v/inn.es expressed in paragraph 4 of your despatch I have examined the question at iss'.e iren the point of view of the limits of the area over Wi.he.i bnese criles have indubitable claims, hr, Inyrains reports tixat he has no do bt that they not only claim but are in scattered but permanent occupation of the whole of the steppe country up to the desert area. The limit of this steppe countiv may be tnhen to be represented by a line pai all el i,o and about 20 miles south of the line indicated in your telegram No.80 of 1935* The 20 mile wide strip of tei j. itory between taese two lines is the desert area mentioned in paragraphs 4 and 8 ( 2 ) of Mr. Ingrams 1 note of the 19th August 1935 transmitted to you with Colonel Lake’s secret despatch of t.ne 20 th August 1955. This desert area has no permanent inhabitants but is visited after rain for purposes of hunting and grazing by the Hadhramaut tribes I h&lt;xve i.ientioned. It is not frequented by tribes from the north. It should therefore be included in the sphere of the Aden Protectorate rather than in that of King Ibn Sa ! ud, and I remain of the opinion that admission of the latter to it involves a real risk of opening a door for his penetration into Iladiiramaut affairs, and of sacrificing local interests by enabling him to restrict or prohibit the ancient customary rights of our tribes to enter the district. 4. If his Majesty’s Government decide that this risk mus l. be taken in view of the special considerations mentioned in your despatch it will be possible to concede to King Ibn Sa’ud a part or the whole of this desert area, and to limit the British claim to the retention of the steppe country. I recommend most strongly that in no circumstances should any of the latter be sacrificed. To do so would undermine the confidence of the tribes that has been gained by our more active policy in that part of the Protectorate, and would undo much of the very successful political work on1 s S) //h?,ch Hr, In^rTtas hr..s lately been occupied; and it would render very difficult., if not impossible, a peaceful development of the policy indicated in your secret telegram Ho,128 ox the blst December 1956 0 I therefore consider tent the maximum possible concession to King Ibn Sa’ud is a line drawn from t e intersection of the violet line with meridian 48 to a point 00 miles soutu of the intersection of parallel 19 and meridian 52. For the reasons that I have urged on this and previous occasions I mope that it will be ■possible to concede less than This, especially in the neighbourhood of the violet line, which already intersects a portion of the Seia f r country, I trust that His Majesty’s Government will in no event contemplate any further retreat beyond the line that I have now suggested, I have, etc,, (Sgd.)

Citj-Gate House, Finsbury Square, London, 3.C.2. L_. C. 11th June, 1937. Lear Mr. Walton, As agreed between us yesterday afternoon, the ICth instant, I am sending you a short note containing such information as we have on conditions in the hinterland south and south-east of the Trucial Coast. It would appear from this that certain areas which might possibly contain conditions favourable for oil are outside the effective control of the Trucial Coast rulers, with whom we are already in touch and from whom we hope to obtain concessions. The question which therefore arises - that is, with whom we ought to deal in such cases, ana with whom you are willing that we should deal - is one which we cannot long delay facing, and this for two reasons: firstly, the extent of their effectively controlled hinterland eventually affects the value of concessions which the Trucial shaikhs may grant us: and secondly, our field programme in that area for next cold weather must depend upon the extent to which we can hope for access to the inlying areas. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) Stephen E. Gcuring. ? t '«j End. J.C.falton, Esq., C.B., If. C., India Office, Whitehall, Sf . 1. P.S. I am sending a copy of this letter and note to Mr. Rendel of the Foreign Office.384^/37. r,C'F: OK COM) IT I OKS IK TE3 HIKTTBLAKD SOUTH AKD SOUTH-EAST CP THE TRUCIAL COAST. P.C.L. Geologists who worked on the Trucial Coast, generally 'based on Eubai, during the cold weather o± 1936/37, report that not the least interesting area is likely to lie immediately to the west of the Oman mountain range, running south-east to north-west and south to north. The area concerned thus includes presumably the inlying portions ox the territory under the real or nominal control oi the Trucial Coast rulers. The Company is, however, without information as to the distance inland covered by the effective authority of these rulers, as v/ell as their boundaries inter se and the extent to which nomadic or shepherd tribes in the interior are to be regarded as their subjects. In respect of the area, under pa.rticular reference - that is, the crescent west of the Oman ranges - there appear to be other^ possible claimants to powe r. These are, firstly, the Sultan of Muscat and Oman himself, doubtful as it may be how far his authority extends westwards of the mountains: secondly, the Imam of Oman (understood to be in some sort ox relations with Ibn Saud) whose status appears to be quite independent of the Sultan of Muscat: thirdly, the inlying tribes themselves, and in particular the Beni Chittib (who seem to control the Jebel Paiyah area and to owe no real allegiance to the Shaikh of Sharjah, who claims them), the Beni Cha'ab (possibly controlled to some extent by Ras-al- Khaimah), the Ka’um (who oc cupy Ba raimi and Jebel al Aouha), the Abu Shems (occupying Jebel Hafit and part of the Baraimi Oasis). The Company’s position is that it is anxious to send its Geologists to explore this country and, in fact, as much of the/2 . the Truciel and Oman hinterland as possible. Tne Company’s Geologists believe that there are no insuperable physical difficulties in the way of such exploration, which they would probably be able to carry out with the help oi gooa guides and perhaps fairly generous presents to the de facto rulers. It is clear, however, that such movements would require the concurrence of the Political Resident in the rersian Gulf. Prom the Company’s point of view the step most desired would be a comprehensive definition of boundaries and authorities in the area concernedi or, failing this, permission to make its own arrangements for further exploration. The idea under which the Company started - that the hinterland was necessarily under the control of one or other of the coastal rulers - can no longer be entertained. (Intd.)

Sir, With reference to Foreign Office letter No. E. 2683/258/91*of the 10th June# asking that an earljr meeting of the Middle East (Official) Sub -Committee might be called to discuss the question of the south eastern Arabian frontiers, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit to you the accompanying copies of further correspondence With His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda on this question, with a request that copies may be circulated to the members of the Sub-Committee for their consideration at the Sub-Committee’s next meeting. 2. I am to explain, with reference to Enclosure No. I (Foreign Office telegram No. 31 of the 7th May to Jedda) that the Secretary of State thought it desirable, before referring this matter to the Sub -Committee, to obtain Sir Reader Bullard’s views on a suggestion, which + Circulated as Paper No. M.E.(0) 227.had been tentatively put forward in this department, that, in view of the considerations urged in Sir Reader Bullard’s despatch No* 47 of the 27th March, a unilateral declaration by His Majesty’s Government, laying down their own views regarding the frontier, might offer a solution of the problem. Sir.Reader Bullard’s comments on this suggestion are contained in his telegram No* 51 of the 17th May (Enclosure No. 2), but further action on that paper was deferred pending the receipt of more definite information from Petroleum Concessions Limited, as to their intentions with regard to the development of their oil concession in Tatar. It now appears* from informal and unofficial information which has been received from representatives of the Company, that it is improbable that they will undertake even prospecting work in Qatar for some considerable time, and this may therefore render the proposed unilateral declaration by His Majesty’s Government unnecessary. This informa tion was communicated to Sir Reader Bullard in Foreign Office telegram No. 37 of the 9th June (Enclosure No. 3). 3. Meanwhile » a further despatch from Sir Reader Bullard (No. 97 of the 17th May - Enclosure No. 4) was received, in this department on 14th June, supplementing his views as given in his telegram No® 51. This despatch has, of course, crossed Foreign Office telegram No. 37 to Jedda and is therefore to some extent based on premises which are no longer applicable. Mr. Eden considers, however, that the arguments advanced in it are of sufficient general importance for it to be desirable that they should be before the Sub-Committee at its next meeting.4, With regard to paragraph 4 of Sir Reader Bullard’s despatch No e 97, I am to explain that the question of the supply of arms to King Ihn Saud, in response to His Majesty’s appeal as reported in Sir Reader Bullard’s telegram No e 40 of 12th April (of which a copy - Enclosure No, 5 - is enclosed for convenience of reference) has been forming the subject of urgent correspondence with the ’V&amp;r Office and Treasury during the past six weeks. Mr. Eden still hopes that it may prove possible to return a favourable reply to King Ibn Baud’s appeal in this matter - and indeed attaches the highest political importance to doing so. The technical and material difficulties involvediBve, however, proved extremely serious, and it is not yet possible to say how far it will prove practicable to overcome them. 5, As regards the question of giving King Ibn Saud assistance in air matters, which is referred to in the final sentence of paragraph 4 of Sir Reader Bullard’s despatch, I am to explain that on this point the practical difficulties have already proved insuperable, and it has been agreed that the best course will be to explain the position frankly to the Saudi Government in the hope of making them understand that the inability of His Majesty's Government to assist King Ibn Saud in this matter is not due to any lack of goodwill but is based on purely practical considerations. It is proposed, however, to defer this communiccoion, in the hope of being able first to give King Ibn Saud some satisfaction in the matter of arms.-4- So As regards paragraph 5 of Gir Reader Bullard s despatch, 1 am to enclose for convenience Ox reference (Enclosure No. 6 ) a copy of Sir Reader Bullard’s despatch No, 57 of the 7th April, to which reference is made. Colonel Fowle’s reply (his semi-official letter No. oeC-S* of the 26th May to the India Office) to the points reused by Sir Reader Bullard, has now been received, and the India Office are being asked to furnish you with copies for circulation to the Sub-Committee. 7. The point made by Sir Reafer Bullard in the x.ate.c part of paragraph 5 of his despatch ii based on a mis apprehension. The Foreign Office despatch (No. 563 of the 23rd December, 1936) to which Sir Resmier Bullard refers, transmitted copies of semi-official c ^rreopondence regarding an informal request, received by the India Office from the Bahrein Petroleum Company, for the assistance of His Majesty’s Government in carrying cut a survey of the Persian Gulf coast oi Saudi Arabia, \.xth a view to the possible development of a Saudi port at Has Tanura. The objections to this proposal were pointed out by the Admiralty in a semi-official letter, dated 6 th November, 1936, to the India Office, of which, owing to a misunderstanding, no copy was seno to His Majesty s Legation at Jedda at the time. 8 . Finally, I am to enclose copies of Sir Reader Bullard's despatches Nos. 38 E of 11 th March (Enclosure No. 7) and S9E of • 8 th May (Enclosure No. 8 ) which are referred to in-5- ■ paragraph 6 of Sir Reader Bullard’s despatch, and the first of which has an important hearing on the economic aspect of the whole question. 9 .

Your despatch No. 47 /of March 27th: South-Eastern Arabian frontiers/ 7 . I agree as to undesirability of pressing Ibn Saud further for a decision at this stage. But to leave question indeiinitely in the air would be dangerous as (inter alia) Petroleum Concessions Limited may soon begin prospecting in south-western area of Qatar peninsula. If nothing were done to crystallise frontier situation on lines which appear to us reasonable and such as to fulfil our obligations to our Jirab client States, might not Ibn Saud be tempted to extend his influence still further, thus rendering eventual settlement more difficult, especially if Anglo-Saudi relations were to deteriorate as a result of Palestine report? 2 * In these circumstances, would you advocate unilateral declaration by His Majesty's Government - which could, if necessary, be treated as confidential - laying down line which they regard as boundary. This could be done in a friendly note to Ibn Saud, explaining that, while appreciating His Majesty's reasons for not wanting to commit himself on this subject at present, we cannot leave matter m the air. We therefore propose to treat following line as marking what we regard as frontier between Saudi Arabia on the one hand and Qatar and Abu Dhabi on the other.

It would then he explained that His Majesty’s Government do not intend to claim lor themselves or their proteges anything heyond this line, hut propose to treat the territory on the Qatar and Ahu Dhahi side of the line as being under their suzerainty and control, or that of the Arah rulers concerned. It would end hy explaining that His Majesty’s Government desire to record their position in this matter in order to avoid all risk of misunderstanding in the future, hut that, in view of Ihn Baud’s known attitude and in order to save him any possible embarrassment. His Majesty’s Government will not press for its publication for the present. Please telegraph your views.

Iossibillty that prospecting for oil may begin soon in disputed area justifies proposed communication to Ibn Saud. to make to suggested wording except that I should prefer to say that His Majesty's Government will not 'make any public announce ment on the subject' rather tnan 'press for its publication'. 2. To make communication a little less unpleasant I think some such procedure as this essential: First, we should send a reply to request for arms (my telegram 40 of April 12th). We should remind Ibn Gaud of arms supplied in 1929 at a critical moment and say that we do not propose to press for balance of payment, or better that balance has been wiped out. Then we should say what arms can be supplied soon. Any decision about aviation that had been taken by His Majesty’s Government could be included in this communication. .oater we should send a separate communication replying in detail and as sympathetically as possible to protest about being hemmed in (my despatch 46 of March 27th). Declaration about Qatar boundary should be made incidentally. We should offer to show any Saudi representative that Jabal Nakhsh is part of Jabal Dukhan and that description of country given in Fuad's Nothing else justifies it in my opinion. I have no objection letter/letter of April 3rd, 1935 is seriously inaccurate. Amongst arguments rejecting accusation of unhelpfulness \re could mention admissibility of assistance (if actually afforded) refer ed to in your despatch 363 of December 23rd. 3. I realise difficulty about giving Ibn &gt;Saud royalty on Qatar oil but I must again remind you of invidious position described in my despatch 38E of Llarch 11th in v/hich we stand with regard to Ibn Saud in the matter of actual and potential resources of the coast of the Persian Gulf.

(E 3194/258/91). Jto. 97. X (791/430/47). British Legation, Jedda. 17th May 1937. Sir, I have the honour to submit my observations on your telegram No. 31 dated 7th May, in which you suggest that a unilateral declaration about the Eastern frontier might be made to Ibn Saud by His Majesty’s Government. The main points of this despatch are being sent to you in my telegram No. 51 dated May 17th. 2. If it is probable that Petroleum Concessions Ltd. may soon begin to prospect in or near the Jabal Nakhsh area, then that furnishes a strong argument in favour of clarifying the situation. I cannot see any other argument on that side for I do not believe that Ibn Saud would encroach on any territory anywhere else which he knew was claimed by His Majesty’s Government on behalf of some ruler under their protection, unless of course he decided to throw in his lot with the Italians, in which case they would doubtless urge him to adont a ’’forward''policy. I could have wished that the Jabal Nakhsh area might have been left alone for a few months, until representatives of both sides could visit the spot together and the fact that Jabal Nakhsh is part of Jabal Dukhan could be demonstrated to Ibn Saud, but I realise that once a prospecting licence has been granted for a given area the licensee has a right to prospect anywhere within/ The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., ., &amp;c «, &amp;c.&lt; within that area in the absence of any stipulation to the contrary. 3. I agree, then, that we ought to let Ibn Saud know that in snite of subsequent arguments His Majesty’s Government maintain in regard to the boundary between Saudi Arabia and the c^atar Peninsula the position which was explained to His Majesty at Riyadh by Sir Andrew Ryan, and that we cannot admit his claim to Sufuk (Safaq). I think however that the manner in which this is to be done is important, and I suggest that the following procedure be adopted. 4. In the first place we should, I think, make some reply, not connected with the frontier question in any way, to Ibn Saud's appeal for assistance in the acquisition of arms &amp;c. We might begin by reminding him that at a critical moment in 1929 we hastened to supply him with arms to the value of some £30,000, and that in spite of the difficulties which our parliamentary system involves we have recovered from him only one-tenth of the cost of these arms; and we might add that in view of His Majesty’s desire to provide himself with other supplies of modern weapons we do not propose to cress for the payment of the balance due. If we could say that the balance had been wiped out it would be an excellent thing, but I realise that it might be difficult to obtain the consent of the Treasury to that course. 'ye should then give as favourable a reply as possible to Ibn Saud’s appeal for arms which I reported in my telegram No. 40 dated 12th April. It would be a good thing if we could say that we would Provide immediately at least some rifles and machine guns with ammunition, either free or at a low Price, and if we/we cannot do that I fear it will make a very bad impression. If His Majesty's Government wish to assist Ibn Saud with the aviation scheme on which I reported in my despatch No. 51 dated 30th March, this occasion would offer a convenient opportunity for a communication on that point. 5. The communication about the boundary should I suggest be conveyed in a reply to Ibn Saud's protest about being ’’hemmed in' which I sent to you in translation in my despatch No. 46 of March 27th. in a later despatch, No. 57 of April 17th, I left it to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to make the first comments on this rather strange protest, and they may by now have been made. It would seem to be desirable that a reasoned and fairly detailed reply should be furnished, and that the Sufuk - Qatar - Abu Dhabi boundary should be dealt with incidentally. The wording suggested in paragraph two of your telegram under reply seems to be generally suitable, except that I think ,r His Majesty’s Government will not make any public announcement on the subject’’ a better form of wording than 4 ’His Majesty’s Government will not press for its Publication”. We could say that we believe Ibn Baud’s views on Jabal Nakhsh to be based on erroneous information and that we are prepared to send a representative to the spot with a representative of his so that it may be shown conclusively tnat the description of the country on which the Saudi Government are relying and which was given in Puad Bey's letter to Sir Andrew Ryan dated April 3rd 1935 is seriously inaccurate. We might mention as one proof of goodwill (i hone there are others to quote as well) that the pritish Admiralty have recently been cooperating with the (American) Bahrain Oil Company with a view/view to discovering some niece for a Saudi nort at Ras Tanura or elsewhere in the Persian Gulf„ This matter would only he mentioned if the action foreshadowed in the enclosure to your printed desnatch No. 363 ( 3 6304/260/91) dated December 23rd 1936 was in fact taken. 6 . I realise the difficulty there may be in securing for Ibn Saud a share in any oil found in Qatar, even if wells are actually sunk in the disputed area. I would remind you again, however, of the highly invidious situation in which we stand towards Ibn Saud, in that, while he is -Dressed for money, all the actually and potentially profitable carts of the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf are in the hands of small Arab rulers who but for our protection would long ago have been reduced to dependence on Ibn Saud or driven out altogether. This situation was described in my despatch No. 38 E dated 11th March, and although since then, as I reported in my despatch No. 89 dated 5th May, my Soviet colleague has secured an order for payment by monthly instalments of the debt so long due to his Government, and although the talk about the prospects for the working of gold are at the moment a little more optimistic, I do not think the position has changed essentially. The strain that would be put upon Ibn Saud, if oil were found in the Jabal Nakhsh area and he had no share in it would be very great indeed. 7. A copy of this despatch is being sent to Bushire.

He referred to community of interests which His Majesty’s Government claimed ta have with Saudi-jHrabia and suggested it v as to the interest of Great Britain that Saudi Arabia should be as well prepared as possible to defend herself. In reply to questions he stated they had in mind payment by easy instalments, reduction of price, end in general any help we could give them. he specified as most necessary rifles, guns, machine guns and tanks. when I asked whether they needed tanks or armoured cars he said both or either. A. He added that he was authorised to tell me (and Ibn Baud begged ^hat we would not think he was trying to play off one country against another) that on ^pril 10th Italian Minister said that Italian Government could sell them either Italian/Italian or Geriaan rifle and machine guns and wanted to discuss terms. Ihn Saud, who gave us this information out of loyalty, proposed.to keep the Italians in play. 3. I would request most favourable and prompt answers be returned. I fear it would be useless to offer them arms at British commercial prices for they have little if any money to spare for arms. Perhaps we could give them or sell at very low rates weapons now being replaced by more modern types. Addressed to Foreign Office telegram No.40; repeated to Cairo Saving No.4.COPY (E 2439/258/91.) No. 57 . (530/430/40) British Legation, J edda. 7th April, 1937. Sir, The second enclosure to my despatch No. 46, dated 27th March, viz. a translation of a note in which Ihn Saud complains of being 'hemmed in' by His Majesty’s Government on the east, raises questions on which the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is much better informed than I am. More over they are of more immediate concern to the Residency than to this Legation. I shall therefore await such observations as Lt. Col. Fowle may feel it necessary to make, before offering any comments of my own except the general remark that the contents of Ibn Saud’s note suggests that it may be merely a rather wild counter-attack compiled under the pressure of Mr. Rendel’s exposition, which is mentioned in paragraph 16 of the enclosure to my despatch No. 41 of March 23rd, of the strength of the position taken up by His Majesty’s Government in regard to Jabal Naksh and Khor al Odeid. 2. I have written separately about the Qatar frontier in my despatch No. 47 of March 27th. Some time ago Fuad Bey said that some British hand-book ascribed the ownership or the suzerainty of Qatar to Ibn Saud. I s^ld that if one of the hastily-compiled war-time handbooks made such a statement it could not be binding on His Majesty’s Government and Fuad Bey did not press the point. There is no such statement in the Handbook of Arabia, 1917, of which by/ The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P. , etc., .etc., etc.by the way, Fuad Bey proudly displays a copy from time to time. Quite recently Mr- Philby has .rade a similar statement, and he attributes it to one of the handbooks drawn up for the British delegation at the Versailles Conference. Mr. Philby has doubtless told Ion Baud, as he told me, that there is such a book in existence, and that the statement in question shows that His Majesty r s Government took no interest in Qatar until they wanted an alternative air route to the one through Persia and until they thought that there might be oil in Qatar. However untrue this might be it would doubtless help to exasperate Ibn Baud’s feelings of envy on this point. 3. Copy of this despatch is being sent to Bushire. I have. etc», (Sgd.) R.

[E 1869/115/25] Copy No. (No Sir, Ibn Saud and its effect upon policy. 2. in the recent monthly reports sent in from this post reference has been made to the determined efforts displayed by the Saudi authorities to collect money otherwise than by taxation, not only from their own subjects, but also from pilgrims. I he Aviation Society has published regularly in the press during the last few weeks an appeal to pilgrims urging them to subscribe for the defence of their fatherland, the Holy Land of the Hejaz. Then there is the Piastre Scheme, whose main object seems to be the encouragement of local industries. The committee in charge of this project have gone so far as to publish in the Saut-al- newspaper an appeal to Moslems written in ill-spelt English, and to advertise small boxes of dates for pilgrims to take home as “ A Present from Medina.” Other objects for which subscriptions are invited are the sacred well of Zamzam, the Waziriya water scheme for Jedda, the First Aid Society, the Charitable Society, the Asylum for Orphans and the Aged, and so on. The pilgrim guides are required to press these schemes upon the attention of their pilgrims, and for the Aviation Society the guides are under moral compulsion to buy books of 1 riyal tickets proportioned to the number and supposed wealth of their pilgrims, and are left to pass them on to the pilgrims if they can, or to bear the loss themselves. Pilgrims have been subjected to pressure on behalf of these various schemes, but no complaints have been received from British pilgrims. It is accepted that a pilgrim should distribute what he can in charity while he is in the Hejaz, and if there were no societies appealing for his money, it might go to individual beneficiaries or be extorted under various pretexts by the guides. 3. It is easy to deride the thirst for money which underlies these appeals, and the latest Jedda report contrasts the requests for charity with Ibn Sand’s alleged expenditure of over £600 for walnuts and pistachio nuts for his last hunting trip. But it is impossible not to feel some sympathy for him. His personal expenditure is doubtless wasteful in some ways, and it seems hard on a poor country to have to support a royal family, which includes twenty-five princes and a corresponding number of princesses and queens, but there is no reason to think that any economy that would be compatible with the King’s position and oriental methods of accountancy would make a great difference to the budget. 4. The word “ budget ” is only used by convention, for it is probable that the Saudi budget exists largely in the head of the able Nejdi, who is Ibn Sand’s Minister of Finance. Income is irregular and incalculable, and expenditure spasmodic. If the King wants money suddenly for some purpose the Minister of Finance must produce it somehow, and there are demands from the Amirs Saud and Faisal also to be met, and the simplest way to meet essential expenditure is to leave for some future time the payment for services rendered or goods supplied. All Saudi officials, except those who are in position to look after themselves, are permanently in arrears with their pay for periods extending at times to half a year. Many foreign chauffeurs, employed for the State cars, have been glad to recover, before leaving, a third or a quarter of arrears of pay extending back sometimes for two or three years. The Soviet Legation 'are still trying, apparently with no hope of success, to recover payment for oil products to the value of about £30.000, which they supplied to the Saudi Government in 1930. A Polish firm supplied a considerable quantity of arms to the Saudi Government in 1930, and it is believed that the efforts they made to recover the second half of the price were not successful. The difficulties which have beset our attempt to recover the cost of arms supplied by the Government of India at the time of the r981 e—11'2 Nejd rebellion in 1929, are only too well known to His Majesty’s Government. Although considerable sums have been collected from pilgrims during the last two months, there are the usual signs of financial stringency. The Legation even had to appeal to the good offices of the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs for pay ment of the balance due to the Eastern Telegraph Company (Limited) for the period ending the 31st January; the Saudi Government paid £1,000 and left over £2,000 outstanding. 5. The main difficulty is that in spite of his policy of economic development Ibn Baud is still dependent almost entirely, either directly or indirectly, on the pilgrimage as a source of revenue. It is nearly a year now since there seemed to be ground for hope that oil would shortly be discovered in Hasa in commercial quantities, but this hope has not been fulfilled, though it is true that it has not been abandoned. The Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate have discovered a gold mine, or rediscovered an old one, with gold in what would ordinarily be paying quantities, but the water which would make it possible to work the mine on an economic basis has not yet been found. The Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) (Limited), which has begun to prospect for oil along the coastal belt of the Red Sea has no good news to report. It is true that the prospectors have not been at work long, and it must also be remembered that an American company found oil at Bahrein where the Shell Company had given up the search, but the reports from the company’s experienced geologists, who seem to have covered most of the ground, have left the Jedda manager very gloomy. Two other possible sources of wealth can be foreseen at present: that oil will be found in the Rub’-al-Khali, and that somewdiere in such parts of Arabia as are not included in the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate’s concession gold or some other valuable mineral will be found in quantities and in conditions that will repay the working. There can be little in the commercial schemes which are discussed in the Mecca press from time to time. It is not by selling to pilgrims small boxes of Medina dates that the Saudi budget will be made to meet at the back, nor by curing rather less badly the few skins the country has to export. Several grandiose schemes, which in succession raised Saudi hopes, have come to nothing. The chief of these were the Jedda-Mecca Railway, the Saudi State Bank, which the ex-Khedive was supposed to be prepared to establish, and the loan of half a million or so which the Saudi Government hoped they could raise in England on rather vague security. 6. For the present, then, the Saudi Government are living on the pilgrimage revenues supplemented by windfalls, such as advances in respect of the various concessions, the purchase by the Italian Government of an unknown number of camels at absurdly high prices, and consignments of arms, petrol, &amp;c., for which they have never paid. Thus, windfalls apart, Saudi Arabia is dependent upon a source of revenue on which not even the Hejaz alone had to live before the war, for there seems to be no doubt that the Ottoman Government put into the Hejaz, in the way of subsidies and in overhead expenses, more than they ever got out of it. The country being dependent upon the pilgrimage, the size of the pilgrimage is of the first importance. The fluctuations of this manifestation of religious enthusiasm are well known to you. The total of overseas pilgrims this year was about 50,000. In 1927 it rose to 132,000, and in 1933 it fell to 21,000. The number of pilgrims falls in times of economic stress, but it is also affected by national policy and social changes, as in Soviet Russia, Turkey and Persia. No Soviet citizens, and very few Turkish, now come on the pilgrimage, and the number of Persians is diminishing. Statements made recently in the course of conversation by members of the Persian and Afghan Legations in Jedda suggest that their Governments regard the pilgrimage as a useless drain upon the national resources. On the other hand, it seems likely that the increasing feeling of Arab solidarity will help to maintain, if not to increase, the number of pilgrims from Egypt, Syria and Palestine and perhaps Iraq, while in Moslem countries under European rule not only will the authorities be careful not to take any action which might be interpreted as interference with the pilgrimage, but nationalist feeling will probably tend to encourage the pilgrimage by using religious to supplement political feeling. But it seems unlikely that the average number of pilgrims will increase to such a point as to enable Ibn Sand to reduce the oppressive pilgrim dues, which he would doubtless be glad to do not only because he would be exposed to less criticism, but for religious reasons too. aftei most shrii conn Yem . pan- the .

I have redrawn above the familiar picture of Ibn Saud searching year after year for normal sources of revenue, and thrown back time after time on the most invidious, viz., levy of toll upon Moslems making the pilgrimage to the shrine of Allah. It would not be surprising if this disposed him to class his country with the “ have-nots.” And it happens that with the exception of the Yemen, which he refrained from annexing in 1935, partly out of consideration for pan-Arab feeling, but partly no doubt for fear of Italy, he sees around him on the Arabian Peninsula more than one territory which he could absorb but for His Majesty’s Government, and whose absorption would be to his economic advantage. This does not apply to the south, for whatever political attraction the Hadhramaut may have for him, it contains no obvious form of material wealth. But on the Persian Gulf the situation is different. There is one small sheikh in possession of the fine natural harbour of Koweit and a pearl fishery, and in far too favourable a position for smuggling into Saudi territory. Another sheikh so small that Ibn Saud always refers to him by a familiar nickname, not only claims the whole of the Qatar Peninsula, including a hill that Ibn Saud particularly wants for himself, but has granted an oil concession like an independent sovereign. Running down the coast are various insignificant people whose only purpose in life seems to be to bar Ibn Saud from the sea, from any oil that may be discovered there, and from any pickings that might be got out of Imperial Airways. Finally, there is Bahrein, which used to belong to Ibn Saud’s ancestors but now stands more or less on its own feet, and which, moreover, has an oil well gushing away as if in mockery of the miserable seepings in the wells which have been bored in Hasa, And in all these territories His Majesty’s Government have “ interests ” which prevent their being absorbed, as much to their own as to the general advantage, in Saudi iVrabia. Such is the picture which Ibn Saud may be expected to paint to himself. 8. In these circumstances it is reasonable to suppose that although Ibn Saud seems to have decided that on the whole His Majesty’s Government are to be preferred to the Italians as friends, the recognition of our interests in Arabia puts a great strain upon a monarch who is not only ambitious but probably insolvent too. It might be argued that the poorer Ibn Saud is the less likely he is to engage in a policy of adventure, but my own opinion is that on the whole a more generous view is justified, viz., that anything that increases his legitimate revenue is to be welcomed by His Majesty’s Government, and any expenditure that might embarrass his finances is to be deprecated. To increase his revenue is not in our power, for without giving pilgrims money, as the Italians have done this year for propaganda purposes, we can hardly do more to facilitate the accomplishment of the pilgrimage by British pilgrims than is done already. We can, however, apply the second principle to any scheme which comes up for consideration. In my despatch No. 20, dated the 10th February, I applied this principle to the suggestion that His Majesty’s Government might perhaps help in the reconstruction of the Saudi portion of the Hejaz Railway, and opposed it chiefly on the ground that the railway would be a financial liability to Ibn Saud and not an asset. If it could be shown that the railway would not be a burden on Saudi finances, the proposal would, I think, deserve reconsideration. The principle enters into the consideration of other questions affecting the relations of His Majesty’s Government with Saudi Arabia, but it is unnecessary to go into details here. I have, &amp;c. R.

Sir, References have been made from time to time in the monthly Jedda Reports (e.g. para.41 of January 1937) to attempts made by the Soviet Legation to collect a sum believed to be about £30,000 for oil products supplied to the Saudi Government some years ago. I now have the honour to report that my Soviet colleague informs me that after months of negotiation he has received an order on the Banque Misr for the payment every month of one-twelfth of the sum due until the whole is paid off. M. Khakimoff is by no means sure that there v/ill always be funds in hand to enable the order to be honoured, but he says that the order can be discounted by the Soviet Trade Representative in iondon, so that his Government will realise at least part of the debt due to them. He states that sone of the goods to which the crder for payment relates were supplied as long ago as 1928. 2. In my despatch No.64 dated April 16th I deprecated our pressing Ibn Saud for the money which he owes for arms supplied to him some years ago. The issue to the Soviet Legation of an order for the payment of a considerable sum albeit many years after the dates on which the goods were supplied suggests that the financial situation in this country is perhaps a little easier than seemed likely, but the other arguments set forth in my above-mentioned despatch hold good, and I have not changed my opinion that we should refrain at present from pressing/ The Right Honourable Anthony Eden. il.C. , LLP.,1 V \s pressing for the money due from Ihn Saud to His Majesty's Government and the Government of India.

In the course of a conversation this morning, Mr. Longrigg, of Petroleum Concessions Limited, told me that it was not yet decided whether his Comoany would carry out prospecting work in Qatar or not. They would rrobably have done so had it not been for the recent disoute which had developed between Bahrein and Qatar over the allegiance of the Naim tribe in North-Western Qatar at Zubara, which was apparently claimed by the Sheikh of Bahrein. I said that I thought that His Majesty’s Government, who had strong views about the integrity of the Qatar peninsula, would not be at all likely to recognise any claims by the Sheikh of Bahrein over this area. 2. Mr. Longrigg then told me that he thought the indications of oil in Qatar were promising, particularly in the Jebel Dukhan, but he had clearly never heard of the Jebel Nahksh. 3. He went on to make an appeal to me to get the frontier question settled. He said that it was most inconvenient for Petroleum Concessions Limited not to have clear information about the frontiers. They had of course their own map of the Qatar concession, but they understood that there was great uncertainty about what he called the 'blue line' frontier, and it would be a great help to them to know where the frontiers really ran. This did not only apply to the frontier in the neighbourhood of Dohat-es-Salwa (where/(where Mr. Longrigg seemed still to have some hopes that we might claim the original blue line and agree to his Comnany getting a concession to the west of the bay), but also to the hinterland of Abu Dhabi and of the other trucial sheikhdoms. 4. I explained to Mr. Longrigg that in the Eastern Area and in the hinterland of the trucial sheikhdoms other than Abu Dhabi, there was no question of any effective claims by Ibn baud. Tne minor trucial sheikhdoms marched not with Saudi Arabia but with Muscat. Mr. Longrigg said that he had recently written to the India Office on this subject, but that the information which the Company had received suggested that the Sultan of Muscat had no authority at all in such places as the Baraimi oasis„ Here, and particularly further South, (e.g. in a large area centring round the intersection of Parallel 22 and Meridian 56) the only effective authority was that of the Imam (presumably the Imam of Oman), who was virtually independent of the Sultan of Muscat. It would be the greatest help to the Company if the limits of the various territories concerned could be defined. 5. I told Mr. Longrigg that, as regards this Eastern sector of the area, the India Office were the Department cos'inly concerned (which he already knew) , but that it seemed to me that his Company neea not anticipate serious difficulties as all the States concerned were in very close relations with us. A more complicated question was that of the frontier with Saudi Arabia. I could give him no indication when this was likely to be finally settled. I asked him, however, to keep me fully informed of the Company’s activities in Qatar, as this might have a bearing on our handling of the situation. (Signed). G.W..

In order, therefore, to assess the worth of his claims a very brief sketch of the rise of the Wahabi Dynasty, as well as of the Arab Shaikhdoms, is necessary (see Lorimer f s n Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf* Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter VIII, and other authorities)# 4# (a) One has become so accustomed to Ibn Saud's long rule over an ever-expanding Saudi Arabia, together with an impression of a centuries-old Empire skilfully created by his reiteration of * ancestral claims*, that one is inclined to forget how comparatively recently the Saudi (Wahabi) Dynasty was founded. In point of fact this did not occur until about 1760 when Muhammad bin Saud adopted Wahhabism and with its aid rose to power as Amir of Nejd. (k) Kuwait , which was founded in about 1716 by settlers from the •Utub tribe, was by 1756 a Principality of importance# From 1793 to 1795 and in 1808 the Wahhabis made unsuccessful attacks on Kuwait# There is nothing noteworthy in their relations with Kuwait until 1897, when Abdur Rahman, father of Ibn Saud, on being driven out of Nejd by Ibn Rashid, sought refuge in Kuwait with his son and became a pensioner^of Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait. The latter gave Ibn Saud much active assistance in the field and it was from Kuwait as a base that Ibn /3- Ibn Saud succeeded in maJcing himself Amir ol Hejd in 1904. Since that date, up to the present time, Kuwait has remained, as before, independent of Nejd. (c) Bahrain was taken from the Persians in 1783 by the •Utub tribe, whose descendants now rule Bahrain, from zubarah. It was not till 1810 that the Wahhabis exacted tribute from the local Shaikhs and placed an agent there, who, however, was driven out the next year by the Sultan of Muscat and by 1814 Wahhabi influence in Bahrain had ceased. In 1830-31 the Wahhabis again forced Bahrain to acknowledge their supremacy but the Ruler of Bahrain repudiated this two years later. In 1836 the Shaikh of Bahrain undertook to pay nominal tribute to the Wahhabis, who were, however, soon expelled from Hasa by the Egyptians and were therefore cut off from exercising any influence in Bahrain. In 1847, after the expulsion of the Egyptians by the Wahhabis, the Ruler of Bahrain again undertook to pay tribute to the Wahhabis but this was evidently not paid as the question of tribute again arose in 1851, which was the last occasion the Ruler of Bahrain in any way submitted to the Wahhabis. Qatar. Please see paragraph 4 of my letter No. 594-S, dated the 28th June 1934 (copy to India, Jedda and Bahrain under Printed letter No.595-S of same date) • (e) /(e) The Trucial Co&amp;at was held by the Q,awasim (Jowasimee) tribe under one of their Shaikhs well before 1760. The leadership varied from time to time being held sometimes by the Ruler of Has al Khaimah at others by another of the Coastal. Shaikhs, but it was always within the Qawasim tribe. For subsequent history see paragraph 5 of my letter of 28th June 1934 quoted above. (f) Muscat from as early as 751 A.D. was governed by its elected Imams and had relations with various foreign Powers before the rise of the Wahhabis, who did not appear in f 0man until 1800. For subsequent history see paragraph 6 of my letter of 28th June 1934 quoted above. 5. From the above it will be seen that in comparison with Muscat the Wahhabi Empire is a mushroom growth and that this Empire came into being after the other Arab States with the exception of $atar, which until 1810 or so was part of Bahrain. With regard to Ibn Saud*s ’ancestral claims’ to various States. these claims It appears obvious to me personally that gtacimack to any of the Gulf Shaikhdoms are entirely baseless. His claim to Kuwait in particular appears to me nothing short of fantastic. Hot only did his ancestors never hold it but when the Saudi family were ejected from Uejd they had to take refuge with the Shaikh of Kuwait, who helped the present Ruler to regain his throne. Incidentally, it may be remarked that what makes the Blockade especially galling to the Shaikh of Kuwait is that he regards it as a very poor return for the assistance which Kuwait has rendered to Ibn Saud in the past, both /both in this connection and that mentioned in paragraph 7 below, 6« The situation therefore is as Ibn Saud states. He is M henimed in M by the Arab ^tates of the Gulf which he would like to absorb by conquest as he has done the Hedjaz, and he is. prevented from so doing by His Majesty^ Government. But his position is not peculiar* all over the world there are Powers who would like to ‘absorb 1 smaller States on their frontiers, but who are prevented from doing so by the fear of consequences from various directions. Further his position is inevitable. His Majesty*s Government cannot let him conquer the Arab Shaikhdoms (to which he has no claims) because they are under their protec- other tion, and because - apart from/material considerations - there are two British interests of first class Imperial importance connected with these Shaikhdoms, which it would be quite impossible to allow Ibn Saud to acquire control over* the Air Route and the Oil Fields. The former is of course vital to us, and the latter of considerable importance, considering that our only other supply of oil in this part of the world is in a foreign country - Iran. In case of war su^&gt;ly of oil from a neutral Iran might be a matter of some difficulty, and from a hostile Iran might cease altogether - at any rate for a time. This being so it is obviously essential that we should retain control over the Arab Coast in which new Oil Fields, actual and potential, are situated. 7. Hth regard to Ibn Saud‘8 other general complaint* that His Majesty’s Government have not given him that measure of support which he has had the right to expect. From a broad aspect this complaint is outside my sphere, though personally I should have thought that he had received all the assistance /- 6 - asaiatance from ua, both direct and indirect which is humanly possible, but I cannot help quoting one instance of valuable assistance received from His Majesty’s Government which is connected with the Gulf. In the winter of 1929-30 there occurred a serious revolt against Ibn Saud headed by Ibn Dawish. tfhat principally broke the rebellion was not Ibn Saud*s forces, but the prevention by the Royal Air Force of the rebels entering Iraq and Kuwait territories. This action by the Royal Air Force, as far as Kuwait was concerned, was made possible by the request of His Majesty’s Government to the Shaikh of Kuwait, to which he acceded, that he would not allow his Principality to be used as a base by the insurgents, (it was in return for this co-operation by the shaikh that His Majesty’s Government gave him their assurance that they would do their best to induce Ibn Saud to raise the Blockade which even then was in force.) If the rebels had been able to use Kuwait as a base and a source of supply it is quite probable that Ibn Dawish’s rebellion would have been successful,and that Ibn Saud would not now be King of Saudi Arabia. 8. I trust that the tenor of the above remarks do not give the impression that I have any prejudices against Ibn Saud. As a matter of fact my personal feelings are all in his favour as a Ruler, who, with great courage and ability, and faced with many difficulties, is genuinely trying to d 0 his best for his country. I also fully recognise that, however vexatious his actions may sometimes be from the local Gulf point of view, from the broad aspect his firm control of Saudi Arabia is of great advantage to His Majesty’s Government, while his attitude on the Palestine question has of course been most helpful. I am only too willing to co-operate in trying to meet /7 r\ meet him half-way on Gulf questions. For instance the Bahrain Conference (see correspondence connected with Bahrain Printed letter No.c/633-i.a/l3 of the 28 th December 1935) by which the Saudi Government benefitted, was my suggestion, and more recently I was very glad to work with Rend el over a modification of the Abu Dhabi frontier as indicated by the poaition of the Sufuk wells. But as for the general 'hemming in* by the Arab States of which Ibn Saud complains, I see no solution whatever. It is nobody^ fault, it arises from the hard facts of the situation, and like other hard facts, as far as I can see, it will have to be accepted.

E 2124/258/91] Copy No. Sh‘ R. Bullard to Mr. Eden.—{Received April 19.) (No. 47.) Si r? Jedda, March 27, 1937. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a record made by Mr. Rendel of a discussion which we had with Sheikh \ usuf \asin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba on the 19th March about the eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia in and near the region of Qatar. The record is accompanied by two sketch maps made by Mr. Rendel, viz., (1) the Jabal Naksh area,(') (2) Khor-al-Odeid^ 1 ) 2. In accordance with the instructions conveyed in your telegram No. 1 of the 4th January, I had for some time been discussing the southern frontier with Fuad Bey, as neither His Majesty’s Government nor Ibn Saud felt able to give way about either Jabal Naksh or Khor-al-Odeid. The information collected by Mr. Rendel on the spot seemed, however, to be so clear that I fully agreed with him that it would be worth while to make an effort during his stay in Jedda to come to an agreement on this, the most difficult part of the frontier, in the hope that this potential cause of friction, perhaps dangerous friction in time of crisis, might be cleared out of the way. The history of the case subsequent to the discussion recorded by Mr. Rendel is given in my despatches No. 41 of the 23rd March and No. 46 of the 27th March, but for convenience of reference I summarise the relevant portions of those despatches here. 3. At an interview with Ibn Saud on the 21st March Mr. Rendel made an appeal for a settlement of the Jabal Naksh-Khor-al-Odeid-Sufuk (Safaq) portion of the frontier. Ibn Saud repeated his familiar argument that the whole of the coast used to belong to his ancestors and that the present rulers would not deny it. It was true that he had recognised the treaties between the coastal rulers and His Majesty’s Government in the Eladda Agreement, but on the question of the boundaries there was a limit beyond which he could not go. The boundary of Qatar was well known to be Araik (Uraiq) which was in the nufud. The maps which were at hand were examined, but none showed Araik. I said that unless mv memory was at fault I had seen a map on which Araik was shown to the south of Jabal Naksh; if that were so, there would no longer be any disagreement on this point. Ibn Saud then turned to Khor-al-Odeid, and said that in claiming it for Saudi Arabia he was thinking of the interests of His Majesty’s Government as much as of his own. No one else could govern that region. When crimes were committed there it was to him that the people applied for redress. 4. On my return to the Legation I found that in the only map that showed Araik (that enclosed in Mr. RendeTs letter of the 16th January, 1936, to Sir Andrew Ryan) it was in fact shown just north of Qasr-al-Salwa, i.e., exactly where we have proposed that the boundary should run. I also consulted telegram No. 92, which the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf sent to the India Office on the 1st February, 1936. which supports this view. I therefore wrote to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin suggesting that the definition of the boundary given by the King left Jabal Naksh to Qatar. His reply, which is given as an enclosure to my despatch No. 46, dated the 27th March, if confused in some respects, is clear enough in denying that the King admitted that Qatar included Jabal Naksh and in implying that the boundary runs between Jabal Dukhan and Jabal Naksh. I have since discussed the matter with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin as well as one can discuss a subject with a man who admits that he knows nothing about it. He quotes Fuad Bey’s statement of the 3rd April, 1935, a copy of which was sent to you in Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 100 of the 7th April, 1935, and declares that that letter still expresses the King’s views. Now this statement assumes, in its first paragraph, that there is an area lying between Jabal Dukhan and Jabal Naksh, and. although we know, from Mr. Rendel’s observations, that Jabal Naksh [981 t—1] (0 Not reproduced./ \ !/ is only a part of the Jahal Dukhan, which is slightly higher than the adjacent crest, th is difference in our premises will never be settled by looking at maps in Jedda, and I feel that, if the argument is to be pursued profitably, responsible representatives of the two sides will have to visit the spot together and to come to an agreement about the physical features. 5. I have, however, suggested in my telegram No. 24, dated the 25th March, that it is not desirable to try to force a settlement on the frontier question at the present moment. If what seemed to be the overwhelming evidence obtained by Mr. Rendel had convinced Ibn Sand it would have been an excellent thing, but the note which forms the second enclosure to my despatch No. 46, dated the 2/th March, shows clearly that he is not convinced, and that the frontier on the east remains a very sore point with him. Given this feeling, and the difference of opinion about the physical features in the Jabal Naksh, I feel that to continue to urge Ibn baud at present to accept our point of view would be useless, and would go far to counteract the good effect of the conversations which took place dm ing Mr. Rendel s visit. In any case, I think that no decision to continue to pi ess for the frontier we want should be taken until you have had an opportunity to consider the matter in the light of the recent conversations, and I have recommended this in my above-mentioned telegram No. 24. In the meanwhile. I have sent replies to the two communications on this and kindred subjects which oimed the enclosures to my despatch ^\o. 46, but 1 have foreborne to press our claim. Copies of these replied are enclosed. In one I acknowledge receipt of Ibn baud s complaint against being hemmed in by His Majesty’s Government on the east, in the other I transmit to the Saudi Government the information about the position of Sufuk which has been received in Bahrein telegrams Nos. 64 ami 65, dated the 23rd and 24th March, and give my opinion that there is some serious discrepancy between the Saudi information and our own as to the physical features m the Jabal Naksh region. a t ^ at as we have made up our minds about Jabal Naksh and Khor-al-Odeid, Ibn baud has nothing to gain by delay, while we stand to Jose in that a cause of friction is left which might lead to trouble at a time of Vi? 81 !', i ( 0 l l 0t i t u ink i that either these arguments is completely sound. n Saud may feel that he cannot hope to obtain either of the two coveted areas, ut that is not the same as signing the places away in writing and thus belittling himself in the eyes of the Arab world. As to the danger likely to result from an undetermined frontier, I suggest that the fear of such a danger can be exaggeiated^ If there should ever be war in which His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia were on opposite sides, it is not a description of the frontiers on paper that would prevent Ibn Saud from trying to advance to the shores of the 1 ersian Gulf at various points, while if Ibn Saud were on our side or neutral he would not disturb the statics quo. Everything now suggests that he realises that his interests and those of His Majesty’s Government are hound up wi h each ? k nu r We f a '' e unable t0 g ive him all that he asks for we should at least ink, refrain from pressing him to make an admission that we can do without 7. In order that our claim may not go by default, we might surest that a joint commission should visit the Jahal Naksh-Araik area and examine the physical features on the spot. It is beginning to he a little late in theTar for such a task, and we might suggest the end of the year as a suitable time Then I would urge that we should examine carefully the possibility of giving Ibn Saud a roya ty on any oil that may be struck in or near Jabal Naksh on the pretext that the oil-bearing strata must run partly under his territory. In my despatch No. 38 E. dated the 11th March, 1937, on the finances of Saudi Arabia I stressed the poverty of this country and the strain that will be placed upon Ibn Saud if the search for oil and minerals in his territory continues to be unsuccessful and oil should be discovered as it has been at Bahrein, in the territory of some minor Hds rlk should be'done 7 g 0811 reasonabl y done to reduce 8 From correspondence going back to 1904, of which copies have been retened fiom Bushire it is clear that the Government of India have alwavs regarded Khor-al-Odeid as belonging to Abu Dhabi. On the other hand, it seems equally clear that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi never exercised any authority there en, and Ibn baud claims that it is he who exercises authority there now though it seems that the population is very scanty, if, indeed, the area contains anv inhabitants at all. But even if it were possible to induce the Sheikh of Abu f3 Dhabi to give up Khor-al-Odeid to Ibn Saud, I doubt whether the transfer would be worth the making, since it would not give Ibn Saud the port he needs, and we should have made a political sacrifice without gaining the advantage which I think we stand to gain from any improvement in Ibn Sand’s economic position. 9. Copies of this despatch and enclosures are being sent to the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire. I have. &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. Enclosure 1. Record made by Mr. Rendel, March 20. 1937. South-Eastern Arabian Frontiers. SIR READER BULLARD and I called on Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 19th March to discuss the frontier question. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and a secretary from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Muhammad Shaikho) were also present. Sheikh Hafiz interpreted with Sir Reader Bullard’s assistance. I. 2. Sir Reader began by explaining that not long ago. according to the records he had seen, there had been some thirty questions outstanding between Great Britain and Saudi Arabia. These had now happily been reduced—as regards questions of major importance—to three, i.e., the eastern and southern frontiers of Saudi Arabia, the Transjordan fontier. and the Koweit blockade. He explained that I had taken the opportunity of my present journey to make a special study on the spot of the first of these three questions, and suggested that the occasion of my visit to Jedda might usefully be taken to discuss it in the light of my investigations. 3. Sheikh Yusuf replied that, though certain questions might still be out standing, no question at issue could make any difference to the firmness of Anglo-Saudi friendship. 4. I explained that, while it was happily true that Anglo-Saudi friendship rested on so solid a foundation that such local issues were unlikely ever to disturb it, it was, nevertheless .wise to take the opportunity of the calmness and cordiality of our friendship to clear up all outstanding points and eliminate as far as we could all potential causes of local friction. An unsettled frontier, as had been shown over and over again elsewhere, was always a potential danger. It would surely be well, then, to get the matter finally settled and out of the way as soon as possible. 5. With this end in view I had taken the opportunity of the King’s invitation to me to visit Saudi Arabia to go into the whole matter again with renewed thoroughness. I had discussed it with the British authorities in the Persian Gulf, I had gone through the relevant archives at the British Residency, and, in order to satisfy myself personally that we were not making any exaggerated or unjustified claims. I had, in company with Colonel Fowle. Colonel Loch and Captain de Gaury, flown over and round all the disputed points of the frontier on the northern section of the line, particularly the Jebel Naksh and the Khor-el-Odeid. I confessed that I had hoped that the facts would prove such as to enable us to offer some further compromise in regard to these two points. Our subject, as the Saudi Government well knew, was to meet King Ibn Sand’s wishes to the utmost possible extent. But, unfortunately, my hopes of finding our case ill-founded or of devising a means of suggesting some compromise over the more difficult parts of the line had not been realised. II. 6. I then suggested that we should consider the various sections of the frontier in detail, and that we should begin with the Jebel Naksh. I showed Sheikh Yusuf Yasin our latest map of the Qatar Peninsula, and also a sketch map and elevation of the Jebel Naksh and surrounding district, which I had [981 t— 1 ] b 2drawn myself as a result of my observations from the air (copy attached).() I left him a duplicate of this sketch, which showed unmistakably that the Jebei Naksh is geographically an integral part of the Jebei Dukhan and of the Qatar Peninsula. I pointed out that the obvious line for the frontier of the peninsula ran across the flat sand south of the Jebei, and I developed the obvious general arguments against establishing unnatural and unsound frontier lines. 7. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin replied that the King could legitimately claim a great deal more than the Jebei Naksh. All the tribes in this area really owed him allegiance. But he was, nevertheless, prepared to abandon his rights over the greater part of the area, if the Jebei Naksh remained in his possession. 8. I answered that this might perhaps have been an argument if he were claiming the whole of Qatar. But this was not practical politics. We had, by our treaties, guaranteed Qatar and the Trucial Sheikhs against absorption by any other Power, and King Ibn Saud had recognised and accepted this situation by the Treaty of Jedda. The integrity of Qatar must, therefore, be maintained, and we really could not reasonably be expected to accept any claim which would involve its dismemberment. Had any concession in this area been at all possible I could assure Sheikh Y T usuf Yasin that I should have been the first person to urge it. 9. I added that, in all the early stages of this dispute there had never been any question of a Saudi claim to the Jebei Naksh. The claim, indeed, which had only been put forward by Fuad Bey Hamza at an advanced stage of the controversy, had come as a complete surprise to us. Was it worth then risking a settlement for it? IIT. 10. We then passed on to the second part of the frontier, i.e., that between Saudi Arabia and the Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi. This brought us to King Ibn Saud’s claim to the Khor-el-Odeid. 11. I explained that here also I had very greatly hoped that something might have been done to meet King Ibn Saud’s wishes. But my reading of the archives of the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf had shown that the claim of Abu Dhabi to this area was far older and stronger than I had imagined, and that the Khor-el-Odeid had been formally recognised by us for the past sixty years at least —long before there was any question of any Saudi claim—as the property of the Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi. 12. I then gave Sheikh Yusuf Yasm a summary of some of the relevant history notably the correspondence of 1878, 1881, 1890 and 1906 (see attached note, of which Sir Reader Bullard gave the sheikh a copy later), and read him the second paragraph of Sir Percy (then major) Cox’s letter of the 1st December, 1906, to Sheikh Zaid-bin-Khalifa of Abu Dhabi, which Sheikh Hafiz Wahba translated, and which Muhammad Shaikho took down. 13. Sheikh YTisuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahha attempted to argue that King Ibn Saud’s recognition by article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda of our special treaty relations with the Trucial Sheikhs did not imply any recognition of any particular frontiers; but I pointed out that our recognition of a valid claim by such a sheikh to any particular place formed part of our treaty relations with that sheikh, and must be regarded as covered by Ibn Saud’s recognition of our special relations with him. 14. I added that as regards the Khor-el-Odeid itself King Ihn Saud would not be losing anything of any value. The sea here, as I had seen from the air, was a mass of reefs, while the entrance to the Khor was so long, narrow, winding and shallow, that I could not conceive of its being any use to any one as a harbour. But to us and to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, the continued possession of this area had a different importance, which it could not possess for King Ibn Saud. We did not want the Khor-el-Odeid as a harbour; but the land immediately to the west of it afforded the only land passage between Abu Dhabi and Qatar, and it was far more important for Abu Dhabi to retain the caravan route and to keep a coterminous frontier with Qatar, than for King Ibn Saud, who already had good potential harbours at such places as Ras Tanura, to obtain a new fragment of sea coast of very problematical value. But in any case, as King Ibn Saud would be the first to realise, we could not go back on the categorical undertaking contained in Sir Percy Cox’s letter of 1906. ( 1 ) Not reproduced.IV. 15. We then considered the next section of the frontier, i.e., from the point south-west of the Sabkhat Matti where it turns east, to the point where it joins the frontier of Muscat and Oman. I said that in regard to this sector the situation seemed to me rather more hopeful. In their note of the 3rd April, 1935, the Saudi Government had agreed to the Sabkhat Matti and the line of wells described on the latest edition of Hunter’s map as the Qufa Liwa remaining to Abu Dhabi. All we wanted to be sure of was that the wells of Sufuk, which according to our information lay on the caravan route from Abu Dhabi to Doha, should remain, together with the caravan route itself, within Abu Dhabi territory. The discrepancy between our line and the Saudi line in this area, which was in any case slight, was due to Sufuk being marked where it was on Hunter s map. But there was some reason to believe that this marking was inaccurate, and that Sufuk wells and the caravan route really lay rather nearer to the coast. I had hoped to be in possession of accurate information on this point in time to clear up the matter with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin at once. Unfortunately, we had not been able to find the wells during our flight, and I had just learnt that it would be impossible for Colonel Loch to complete the further investigation he had at once embarked upon before well on in the next week. The point ought not, however, to lead to serious difficulty, since we were really agreed on the main principles involved. 16. Sheikh Yusuf said that Sufuk was a Murra well. I replied that we could not accept these progressive claims for the Murra tribe. We had agreed that Banaiyan was a Murra well and given up Abu Dhabi’s claim to it in con sequence. But all our information showed that the normal Murra dira ended well to the south-west of Sufuk wherever it was. If the Saudi Government always claimed as a Murra well the next well beyond the last well we had conceded, there would be no reason why they should not eventualy claim Muscat town. I made as much play as I could of our concession at Banaiyan, in order to show how ready we had been to concede a point whenever careful enquiry showed that the facts were against us. But this was not so now. V. 17. After a good deal of further discussion in which the historical and legal aspects of the question were touched upon, only to be set aside in favour of a more practical solution on the basis of the situation now existing, Sir Reader Bullard explained that he had at first expressed the view that it would be l)est to leave discussions on this part of the frontier in abeyance for the present. But the investigation I had made into the matter had led him to change his mind, and he now agreed that it would be far better to get the matter settled and disposed of as quickly as possible. 18. I suggested that, although we had at first proposed that the frontier question should be dealt with as a whole, we were now more likely to make progress if we took the various sectors of the frontier one by one. The sector between Saudi Arabia and Muscat involved consultation with the Sultan of Muscat, which was not yet completed and would involve further loss of time. The sector between Saudi Arabia and the Hadhramaut area of the Aden Protectorate was still being reinvestigated by the Aden authorities, and I could not yet say what might emerge. But for the northern sector, i.e., the frontier with Qatar and Abu Dhabi, we now had practically all the material we could need, and I greatly hoped, therefore, that a settlement of it could he reached without further delay. I felt sure that, after all that had passed, it would now be best to tackle this frontier bit by bit. 19. Sheikh Yusuf did not demur to this suggestion, but said he must refer the whole matter to the King. He would do this at once and let us know the result as soon as possible. 20. In conclusion, I again urged the desirability of reaching an early settle ment, I pointed out that three years ago the position had been that we were taking our stand on the strictly legal position and claiming the “ blue ” and “violet” lines. As a result of much very hard work and of our great desire to go to the utmost limits to satisfy King Ibn Saud we had eventually agreed to concede a very large area to him and had finally put forward the “ Riyadh Line.” I showed Sheikh Yusuf these lines on the map and emphasised the extent to whichwe had modified our attitude in order to show our friendship for the King. But what was the position of the Saudi Government ? They had put forward, on the 3rd April, 1935, a line, which I showed Sheikh Yusuf on the map, from which they had never retreated an inch. I was no supporter of a policy oi bargaining, and I did not believe in progressive concessions. But now that the new lines were so close to each other as to approximate within a few miles, I felt the time had really come for the Saudi to make some concession too and reciprocate the con ciliatory spirit we ourselves had shown. There was really now very little between us but, as Sheikh Yusuf would realise from what I had said earlier in the discussion we really could make no further concession. Sir Reader warmly endorsed this appeal and the conversation concluded with a renewed promise from the Sheikh to refer the whole matter to the King without delay. G. W. RENDEL. Jedda, March 20, 1937. Appendix to Enclosure 1. Note for Sheikh Yusuf Vasin. Odeid. 1. 1878. Sheikh Zaid of Abu Dhabi was assisted by Her Majesty’s Government to send an expedition to exterminate the pirates of Odeid. The pirates fled before the expedition arrived, but it was made clear that Her Majesty’s Government regarded the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi as responsible for what happened at Odeid and recognised that place as his territory. 2. 1881. Sheikh Yasin bin Thani of Qatar was told, in reply to his enquiries, that Her Majesty's Government could not agree to his rebuilding Odeid “ as the ylace is an appanage of A bu Dhabi.' 3. 1890. The Turks tried to send a mudir to Odeid, but on his arrival at Bahrein, Her Majesty's Government immediately made diplomatic representations to the Porte, on the ground that Odeid belonged to Abu Dhabi, and the Turks abandoned their project in consequence and the mudir was recalled. 4. The correspondence of 1904-6, ending with Sir Percy (then Major) Cox’s letter of the 1st December, 1906, to Sheikh Zaid bin Khalifa of Abu Dhabi, the first twx) paragraphs of which read as follows :— “ Y r ou will remember that on the last occasion on which we met you asked your friend to look again into the question of the reoccupation of Odeid by you and to make a reference to Government in the matter. “ I did as you requested. The Government have given careful consideration of the question and I am desired to tell you that while they recognise that the place is in your territory and are prepared to prevent its occupation by any one else, but yourself they are not satisfied that its reoccupation by you would have any good or peaceful result, and for that reason are not inclined to assist you in reoccupying the place.' Enclosure 2. ( 1 ) Sir R. Bullard to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. Dear Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, Jedda, March 27, 1937. IN your letter of the 23rd March you kindly sent me a note in which His Majesty King Abdul Aziz was so good as to develop the statements which His Majesty had made during the conversations with Mr. Rendel and myself, about the Arab territories on the Persian Gulf and about the question of trade through the ports on the Persian Gulf. I am sending a translation of that note to the Foreign Office immediately and I am sure that it will be considered by His Majesty s Government, like all the communications from His Majesty, with close and sympathetic attention. Yours, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD.» ' f I v Sir R. Bullard to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. Dear Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, Jedda, March 27, 1937. \\ HEN we had our discussion about the eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia on the 19th March, Mr. Rendel said that he was sorry that he had not been able to locate the Sufuk (Safaq) wells in the course of his recent aeroplane visit to that area, but that we expected to receive the details soon. I am now able to inform you that Safaq has been located accurately. It has been found by careful observations that it is 12 miles due south of Ras Asqhaila. If you have Bertram Thomas’s book Arabia Felix and will look at the large map at the end of the book, Safaq should be placed just west of the initial letter “ S ’ in the name “ Sahkhat Matti.” This means that the distance of Safaq from the coast is only about one-third of that usually shown in the maps, including the large map of Arabia of which I had the pleasure of giving you two copies on the 24th March. This letter is sent to complete the record of the discussion. I take the opportunity to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd March, in which you explain the reference which His Majesty the King made to Araik. From this letter, and from the letter to which you referred in our conversation on the 24th March, viz., the letter written by Sheikh Fuad Bey Hamza to Sir Andrew Ryan on the 3rd April. 1935, I have come to the conclusion that the picture which the Saudi authorities have in their mind of the nature of the physical features in those parts is quite different from the one which we have formed as the result of our inquiries and of the observations made by Mr. Rendel and other British officials on the spot. However, at present, I do not wish to do more than record my opinion that a misunderstanding exists on this point. Yours, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT . TO complete the record of the conversations with Ibn Sand which was sent to you as the enclosure to my despatch No. 41 dated the 23rd March, I have the honour to transmit translations of two documents :— (1) A letter from Sheikh Yusuf Yasin in reply to a letter which I had written to him in the sense of paragraph 17 of the record. I had said that a map in our possession showed Araik as between Qasr-as-Salwa and Jabal Naksh, and had asked whether His Majesty's dehnition did not leave Jabal Naksh to Qatar, but Sheikh Yusuf Yasin s letter does not admit my contention, and implies that there is another Araik (Uraiq) between Jabal Dukhan and Jabal Naksh. (2) A note in which Ibn Sand amplifies statements made by him, in the course of the conversations, about his position in regard to the Arab rulers on the Persian Gulf. 2. The questions referred to in these enclosures will he dealt with separately. 3. Copies of this despatch and enclosures are being sent to Cairo, Jerusalem, Bagdad, Bushire and Aden. (Translation.) Dear Sir Reader Bullard, ^ Jedda, March 23, 1937. THE moment I receive'd your Excellency's letter of the 23rd March, 1937, I hastened to put right the point which your Excellency raised. In the interview I had in haste with your Excellency at your house just before noon on Tuesday, the 10th Muharram (22nd March, 1937), I explained to you that I did not believe that His Majesty the King, in his conversation to which you referred, meant Al Ureyq but Dukhan. There was a slip of the tongue. After I left your Excellency I enquired of His Majesty concerning the actual fact, and His Majesty stated that he did not intend that place, which is south of Naksh. but the one' which is south of Dukhan, which makes Naksh within the Saudi Arab Kingdom. During the conversation His Majesty did not think of giving up the claim concerning the frontiers put forward by the Government of His Majesty. His Majesty’s statement was accidental and did not concern the details of the case. The question was not one of discussing the exact position of the frontiers, and I therefore think the question still stands where it did. EASTERN (Arabia). April 19, 1937. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 3.

With highest respects. YUSUF YASIN. [981 t—3]Enclosure 2. Note by Ibn Saud amplifying his Statements about \his Position in regard to the Arab Rulers on the Persian Gidf. (Translation.) I HAVE spoken clearly about the historical stages in the relations between me and the British Government, all of which have been courteous and consistently amicable on my part, and sometimes on the part of the British. But what filled me with misgiving, much annoyed me and affected my honour are the two following points : — (1) The question of the frontiers of Qatar, Oman and other principalities of the Gulf. (2) The question of trade and marine transport. As regards the first point, these territories themselves, as you are aware, were under the suzerainty of my ancestors, and until the time of my grandfather, Faisal, paid an annual tax for the preservation of the relationship of vassal to overlord. But in view of our desire for the continuation of our friendship with the British Government and the said Amirs to whom we are bound by old ties, we have recognised their positions in the Persian Gulf and their principalities, and have respected the treaties between them and the British Government. But it never entered my head that this could be a reason for taking away a part of our territories and annexing it to those territories at a time when every one admits that the peace which those places enjoy is due to God and to us. It is not reasonable that such pressure should be due to suspicion of us or to doubt as to our intentions or our friendship, or to the accusation that we covet a territory which is ours-. For the covetous man does not covet a mountain or an inlet; he covets rather a densely populated country. What we care for is the protection of our honour and the defence of the rights of our subjects and tribes. As to the question of trade, I know that ships call at, and carry goods and all kinds of merchandise to, ports on the Persian Gulf which are less important than mine, and I who count myself the oldest friend of Britain and the greatest of the Arabs am placed at the mercy of Koweit or Bahrain; and whenever the question is raised, it is said that it is one for the shipping companies. I did not believe that friends could treat each other in such a cruel manner. Praise be to God who granted me and my country more power than that of Koweit, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi, &amp;c. Why should ships call at those places and mine suffer deprivation in that no ships call there? I hope you will, as you have stated, consider the situation as it is and a veil will he drawn over the past if its mistakes can thus be corrected. Otherwise you may inform me of the real reasons. I have summarised in this letter what I have told you at length in my conversation. March 23, 1937.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia).

IN my despatch No. 40, dated the 23rd March, I reported that during Mr. Rendel’s short stay in Jedda, from the 17th to 22nd March, we had several interviews with His Majesty King Abdul Aziz. I now have the honour to enclose a summary of these conversations. The conversations themselves and unavoidable hospitality occupied most of the time during the last two and half days, so that there was not time to make a complete record before Mr. Renders departure. 2. It might have been more satisfactory to divide the record up into portions according to the various subjects discussed, and to send each portion separately with a covering despatch, but there is not time to do this before the bag goes, and in any case the subjects overlap a good deal. Where comment seems to be called for I hope to send it by the following bag, and the question of Palestine, at any rate, requires a telegram. 3. In two or three places I have inserted material which may appear to be remote from present-day politics, e.cj., references to Ibn Saud’s relations with the Sherif (later King) Hussein and to his dealings with British officials in the Persian Gulf before the war. I think these references are relevant as showing that the mind of the King is always roving back to the times when, as he thinks, he deserved well of His Majesty’s Government and reflecting that he has got precious little out of it. I am not saying, at the moment, that any bitterness that Ibn Saud feels on this score is justified, but only that it exists. 4. I have been more than six months at this post, but it was not until now that I could come into contact with the man who directs foreign affairs, as he directs everything else in Saudi Arabia, The peculiar position in which foreign representatives are placed in this country is familiar to you, but it may be of use to illustrate it from my short experience. I arrived at Jedda in the middle of last September, and presented credentials to and dined with the Amir Feisal, a purely nominal Minister for Foreign Affairs, who at once retreated to the hills of Taif. The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fuad Bey, was on leave, and did not return until towards the end of November, and for two months I saw no one connected with foreign affairs except the King’s secretary. Yusuf Yasin, who came to Jedda at the end of September to arrange for the exchange of notes about the Treaty of Jedda and connected matters, communicated a long statement from the King about foreign affairs, and retired to the other side of Arabia. Between the return of Fuad Bey towards the end of November and his hurried and surprising departure on leave a few days before Mr. Rendel was due to arrive, I have had occasional interviews—sometimes at tiresomely long intervals—with Fuad Bey, whom there is reason to think that the King does not entirely trust, and who I think has misled me on one or two occasions. 5. I may mention that during the course of the conversations reported in the enclosure the King twice said that he hoped I would pay him a visit at Riyadh. For many reasons such a visit is not to be undertaken lightly, but it may be useful to have the invitation in hand if matters of importance have to be dealt with and no satisfaction can be obtained here during the long interval between two successive annual visits of the King to Jedda, the only place in Saudi Arabia where a foreign representative is allowed to reside. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to Cairo, Jerusalem, Bagdad, Bushire and Aden. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. [981 m—5] B2 Enclosure. Record of conversations in the course of interviews granted by His Majesty King Abdul Aziz to Sir Reader Bullard and Mr. Rendel on March 20, 21 and 22, 1937. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba were present throughout, and the Amir Feisal appeared on two occasions. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and Sir Reader Bullard interpreted. First Interview, March 20. The King began by laying down the principles which governed his life : (1) his religion, (2) his determination to keep his name above reproach, and (3) devotion to his religion and to the interests of his subjects. He was a self-made man, haying started with nothing in the world, and provided that he stuck to his principles he was prepared to go back to nothing. Times were changing, the pristine honesty of the world was declining, but he would never pursue a crooked path. He believed in consulting everyone, but no one could lead him by the nose. He would always speak to His Majesty’s Government frankly and sincerely. All sorts of stories were afloat about his subservience to the Italians, but he could assure His Majesty's Government that they were nonsense. Mr. Rendel said how much the King’s frankness was appreciated by members of the Government in Great Britain, and Sir Reader Bullard said that he was sure that the King was never suspected by His Majesty’s Government of subservience to Italy, and that His Majesty’s Government knew that his policy was directed to what was their object as well as his, viz., the maintenance of the independence of Saudi Arabia. 2. Ibn baud said that he was a Moslem first of all, but he believed that of all the European Powers the one with whom it was to the advantage of the Arabs everywhere to be on good terms was Great Britain. After some talk on these lines Sir Reader Bullard took the opportunity to convey the thanks of His Majesty’s Government for the advice which the King had given to the Mufti of Jerusalem when the mufti appealed for his help recently (Foreign Office telegram No. 12 of the 1st March). The King expressed pleasure at this mark of appreciation of his efforts and repeated what he had said to the mufti (he had advised him to co-operate with the British in maintaining order and to await the result of the Royal Commission), and he said that he had also warned the mufti not to let himself be made an instrument for Italian intrigues. He went on to say that he wanted the whole “ bundle ” of Arab States to be°on good terms with His Majesty’s Government. He was not thinking of Palestine for the moment; that question was being considered, and he trusted that a solution would be found that would be satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government, to the people of Palestine, and to the Arabs in general. No, he was thinking of danger which threatened the Arab world in two places, the Yemen, and Iraq. 3. First the Yemen. The Yemen was in a ferment. The whole country was against the heir apparent. Ahmad, while the Imam said “yes” to everyone but did nothing. When three of the sons of the Imam came on the pilorimao-e recently, Sayyid Husain spoke to the King about the situation in the^ Yemen and &amp;ske&lt;i for his advice. If there was a revolt in the Yemen, what would be the attitude of (1) Ibn Saud, and (2) the Italians ? According to Sayyid Husain and Ibn Saud knew it to be true—the whole population without exception hated Ahmad and the Foreign Minister, Raghib, a Turk who is in Italian pay Thev had asked for the removal of Raghib, but he was protected by Ahmad Thev had sent the Imam a written protest (here the King gave us a cbpy), but without encGt. If the\ were free they would revolt and sweep away both Racdiib and Ahmad, and the Imam too if he opposed this popular movement 4. To this enquiry from Sayyid Husain, Ibn Saud said he had replied that as for himself, he proposed to observe a policy of complete neutrality and non-intervention in Yemen affairs. He had withdrawn once when he might have occupied the Yemen, and he did not propose to reverse that policy If there should be trouble in the Yemen, the most he could do would he to consult other Arab countries if asked by both sides to try to make peace, and to see what could be done to give effect to the request. As to Great Britain and Italy, Ibn Saud had told Husain about the Rome understanding of 1927, and had said that both the British and the Italians had assured him that it was their firm desire thatI the independence of the \emen should be maintained. In conclusion, Ibn Saud declared vehemently that there must be an outbreak in the Yemen—perhaps before the death of the Imam. In that event, what would the Italians do and what would be the attitude of His Majesty’s Government? 5. Mr. Rendel replied that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciated the dangers of the situation in the Yemen. There was no doubt that the Italians had been, and still are, intriguing actively in that country and would be very ready to fish in the waters they had helped to trouble. But while the internal situation was perhaps more dangerous than it had been, he was inclined, for the following reasons and speaking purely personally, to doubt whether the Italian danger was now quite as acute as it had been a year ago. In the Rome understanding of 1927 His Majesty’s Government had made it quite clear, and the Italians had formally recognised, that His Majesty’s Government regarded it as “a vital imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea.” (At this point Sir Reader Bullard gave King Ibn Saud, for convenience of reference, a copy of an Arabic translation of the relevant text, which had already been communicated to His Majesty by Sir Andrew Ryan.) There was, of course, no reason to trust any Italian promises as such, but it was obvious that, in view of the terms of the Rome understanding, any attempt by Italy to establish herself in the Yemen would be a direct challenge to His Majesty’s Government. No doubt Italian hotheads, possibly Italian local officials, cherished designs on the Yemen. But Italian policy would be directed from Rome, and present indications suggested that for European reasons, and in view of British rearmament, Italy was not now anxious to embark on any conflict with His Majesty’s Government, but was rather seeking to establish better relations. Even if this view should prove mistaken, he did not think King Ibn Saud need be seriously disturbed by Italian activities in the Yemen. Saudi and British interests were closely parallel, and it was difficult to see how any development which threatened Saudi independence could fail equally to threaten British interests, so that the probability was that, in any such event. Ibn Saud would, in any case, find Great Britain at his side. At a later interview the opportunity was taken to mention that the Italians themselves seemed anxious to keep the Rome understanding alive, and apparently feared a forward policy on the part of His Majesty’s Government (see Foreign Office despatch to Jedda, No. 182 of the 24th February). 6. Mr. Rendel added that he understood (from Sheikh Hafiz Wahba) that His Majesty wished to know the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards his suggestion for an exchange of information about the Yemen, &amp;c. Mr. Rendel saw no reason why this should not be possible. His Majesty’s Government would be glad to pass on to Ibn Saud any information of interest which they could properly communicate to him. though in doing this they would, of course, be assuming that Ibn Saud was satisfied that there would be no risk of leakage at the Saudi end. 7. Ibn Saud then turned to Iraq. He had good information, for people wrote to him from all parts of the Arab world and he had seen many Iraqi pilgrims, and the reports all tallied with each other. Everyone was suspicious of the new Iraqi Government and regarded it as not Arab. There had been much to be said against Yasin-al-Hashimi, who had even gone so far as to ask Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to tell Ibn Saud to beware of the British Government, but at least his policy was an Arab policy. To the policy of the present Iraqi Government there were two objections : it was communistic, and it was under Turkish influence. The Turks had begun by trying to get possession of the Sanjak of Alexandretta, and their next aim would be to acquire Mosul. 8. Mr. Rendel said that the title of Communist was sometimes misapplied to anyone who favoured economic social reform. He understood that such reforms were long overdue in Iraq, where there was much extreme poverty, and it was possible that Hikmet Suleiman’s legislation was necessary, and was not imposed in any spirit of communism. It might be well, therefore, to reserve judgment on this point until the Amir Saud and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba should have seen the situation for themselves during their impending visit to Bagdad. (Here Ibn Saud said that Hikmet Suleiman did not care a rap for the poor or for anyone.) As to Turkish influence, Mr. Rendel believed that, while the maker of the military coup d'Etat, Bakr Sidqi, and some of his military associates, might be described as pro-Turkish, Hikmet Suleiman showed signs of wanting to shake [981 m—5] b 2himself free of military influence, and the longer he could maintain his Govern ment, the more hope there was that he would become less dependent on the army’s support. As to the attitude of the Turkish Government, a year ago Mr. Rendel would have scouted the suggestion that Turkey might embark on a policy of adventure. In this opinion he had been seriously shaken by Turkey’s Alexandretta policy, but the Turks had not “got away with it” over Alexandretta, and they had, he thought, felt themselves much isolated at Geneva and had retreated from the extreme position they had taken up. The fact that the Turks had received so marked a check over Alexandretta ought, he felt, to make them much less likely to put forward any other similar claims in future. Second Interview, March 21. 9. Ibn Saud said that he wanted to make some remarks under four heads :— (1) His relations with His Majesty’s Government. (2) The Arabs in general. (3) Palestine. (4) The future. The interview went on for over two hours, but never got beyond the first head. Ibn Saud went over the whole course of his relations with His Majesty’s Govern ment from the moment when he first entered into communication with them through the Political Agent at Bahrein, and suggested that their common interests demanded that the Turks should not be allowed to establish themselves strongly in the Arabian Peninsula, and received an assurance that His Majesty’s Government would not allow the Turks to approach him either by sea or through Koweit. He recited his dealings with Sir Percy Cox during the war, recalled the loyalty with which he had offered to help the Sherif Hussein against the Turks, and spoke of the “ guarantees ” which he had received from Sir Percy Cox. Nothing whatever had come of these “ guarantees,” though he had been promised “ all sorts of things.” He had assisted the Arab policy of His Majesty’s Government by communicating to them the written and oral offers which he received from the Turks as an inducement to him to join them against Hussein— offers which he refused, alleging that he could not move against the British because they were his neighbours on the Gulf, and saying that, in any case, he could not join the Turks when they were slaughtering Arabs. At first he even told His Majesty’s Government that he would accept Hussein as King of the Arabs, but later he was obliged to withdraw this offer. He told Hussein that the resources in money and arms which were supplied by the British were being wasted through being dealt out to the various sheikhs according to the number of followers they said they had, and asked that, if he sent his son and some men to help, they should only be given arms for themselves and food to eat, and Hussein had replied that Ibn Saud must be either mad or drunk. Ibn Saud thereupon informed the British Government that he must lay down two conditions : that he would not recognise Hussein as King of the Arabs, though he did not object to his being King of the Hejaz, and that when the war was over His Majesty’s Government should allow him to settle his own scores with Hussein. He had always listened to the advice of His Majesty’s Government, even to his own hurt. On more than one occasion he had fallen out with his chief supporters, the Ikhwan, for that reason, e.g., when he retook Turaba, which the Sherifians had unjustly occupied, and His Majesty’s Government asked him not to go any further; when he refrained at the request of His Majesty’s Government from taking Aqaba, where the ex-King Hussein was staying, and Maan; and when he listened to the mediation of the British agent at Jedda and ensured the peaceful occupation of the city to the disappointment of some of his followers. For all this loyal support, and after all the promises made to him, what had he got? Nothing whatever. On the contrary ! 10. He would put his complaints under three heads :— {a) His Majesty’s Government had not given him the help he needed. (h) Their boundary policy was always squeezing him in. (c) By their Gulf policy they tried to make him dependent commercially on Koweit and Bahrein.W hereas a friend in need of help looked to a more powerful friend to assist him, he had had no help from His Majesty’s Government. Look what His Majesty’s Government had done for Egypt and Iraq ! Those countries might be richer than Saudi Arabia, but Saudi Arabia could, in his opinion, be more useful than either to His Majesty’s Government. 11. After expressing great interest in the valuable historical survey which ^ the King had given, but pointing out that what we had to adopt as a basis was the facts of to-day, Mr. Rendel suggested that one difficulty was that, whereas countries like Egypt and Iraq, which contained rich natural resources, could be developed by commercial enterprises which would earn their own profits, Saudi Arabia did not at present appear to be economically in that category. If, how ever, Ibn Saud had any particular kind of help in mind and would specify what it was, he could be sure that the suggestion would be considered very carefully. Ibn Saud said that there were all sorts of help that he might mention, but he would speak first of aviation, to which he attached great importance. He had sent to His Majesty’s Minister through “ that man ” (pointing to Sheikh Yusuf \asin) a suggestion about the training of Saudis in aviation in Great Britain. As to the Italians, he swore as a Moslem and an Arab that when the Italian aeroplanes arrived, he wished that Allah would destroy the machines and the men in them. Mr. Rendel reminded the King that the failure of other countries to follow our example in reducing armaments had compelled us to rearm, and that the expansion of the British air force was employing to the full all our resources for the manufacture of aeroplanes and the training of men as pilots and mechanics, and that, while this should tend to deter other nations from disturbing the peace of the world and should therefore be of advantage to His Majesty, it made it more difficult than it would otherwise have been to give His Majesty direct assistance in matters of aviation. Nevertheless, if His Majesty would make specific suggestions, they would be examined most carefully and sympathetically. 12. The subject was again referred to at a later meeting the same day. Mr. Rendel repeated his warning about the peculiar difficulties created by the pre occupation of His Majesty’s Government with their scheme of rearmament, and spoke of the necessity for co-ordination of skilled men with suitable machines if time and money spent on training and equipment were not to be wasted, and of the possibility that Saudi Arabia, having a very small urban population among which to find men with a suitable preliminary training in mechanical work, &amp;c., might find it more difficult than, e.g., Egypt, to produce suitable candidates for aviation work. Sir Reader Bullard suggested that, whereas it might suit the Italians to undertake the training of any number of Saudis because of the political effect it might be expected to have, His Majesty’s Government would be reluctant to embark on any scheme that would not have a reasonable chance of success. He also asked the King what His Majesty thought would be the effect upon the Italians of any close relationship between His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia in matters of aviation. Was there any reason to think that this might encourage them to seek to extend their influence elsewhere, e.g., in the Yemen ? It was true that the Italians had themselves wished to identify themselves closely with Saudi Arabia in aviation affairs, but how far was that merely a phase of the war with Ethiopia and their hostility to His Majesty’s Government on that point? The King said that the Italians still wished to be allowed to develop Saudi aviation, and implied that he didn’t care what they thought. He added bitterly that the pilots trained in Italy were no good. At one point in the con versation the King said that if Iraq shook itself free of Turkish influence he would not mind having some Iraqis to help in aviation later on. 13. It was arranged that Sheikh Yusuf Yasin should prepare for His Majesty’s Minister a note of the Saudi requirements in aviation matters. This note, Ibn Saud was assured, would receive the most careful attention. Third Interview, March 21. 14. The King said that he wanted to speak about his future in relation to His Majesty’s Government. He began with a long and rather pointless account of the negotiations for the Saudi-Iraq Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. In so far as it had a point it was intended to show the Iraqis as rather slippery customers. At Riyadh, said the King, Naji-al-Asil suggested to Ibn Saud that6 Iraq should deal with His Majesty’s Government in the matter of Palestine on behalf of Ibn Sand, and that Ibn Sand should deal with the Imam about ms adhesion to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty. Ibn Sand had expressed surprise at this request, and had said that both States must act together in both matters. He spoke of what appeared to be a similar attempt to side-track him in the matter ot securing the adhesion of the Imam to the treaty. He then spoke of the surprise he ^ had felt at the Iraqis wanting to insert in the treaty a reference to the League of Nations, of which Saudi Arabia was not a member, and added that the Imam would never consent to sign anything in which there was a reference to the League. Mr. Rendel explained that members of the League could not assume any obligation which might be incompatible with their existing obligations under the Covenant, and that they were therefore bound to make a reservation to that effect in any treaty involving military assistance, &amp;c. Moreover, Iraq was also bound by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, which, as His Majesty’s Government had pointed out to the Iraqi Government, involved a similar reservation on the part of Iraq. Mr. Rendel said that, of course, such a reservation would not affect a party not a member of the League, and that consequently neither Saudi Arabia nor the Yemen would be affected by such a reservation on the part of Iraq. 15. The King then said that he had often been asked whether the Arab States of the Persian Gulf could not adhere to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty. He had fended off such enquiries, alleging the unimportance of such States, but he would be glad to know the opinion of His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Rendel reminded His Majesty of the position of His Majesty’s Government in the Gulf. They had had relations with the Arab rulers there in some cases for as long as a century and a half, having been compelled to take action in regard to gun-running, piracy, the slave trade, &amp;c. As a result, as had been made clear at the time of the Treaty of Jedda, the foreign affairs of Koweit, Bahrein, Qatar and the Trucial Sheikhdoms were in the hands of His Majesty’s Government, who exercised sovereignty over them in those affairs and therefore could not allow them to enter into treaty relations with any foreign State. Ibn Saud seemed to accept this statement without demur. 16. This subject led to the question of the frontiers. Mr. Rendel repeated the arguments which he used with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 19th March, saying that His Majesty’s Government had made great concessions in this respect, whereas His Majesty was holding firmly to his original demand. In the northern part of the eastern frontier there remained nothing between the parties but the Jabal Naksh and Khor-el-Odeid. with perhaps an adjustment in the Sufuk (Safaq) region that might go some way towards meeting the King’s wishes. Could not His Majesty make some concession here? It would make an excellent impression on the Foreign Office if he could. Ibn Saud repeated his familiar statement that the whole of the coast belonged to his ancestors and that the present rulers would not deny it. Koweit, for instance; all the tribes living in Koweit were really Saudi tribes. It was true that he had recognised the treaties between the coastal rulers and His Majesty’s Government in the Hadda Agreement^ 1 ) but on the question of the boundaries there was a limit beyond which he could not go. The boundary of Qatar was well known to be Araik, which was in the nufud. 17. The maps which were at hand were examined, but Araik was not marked on them. Sir Reader Bullard said that he had seen a map on which, unless his memory was at fault, Araik was shown to the south of Jabal Naksh. In that case there would no longer be any disagreement on that point. 18. As to Khor-el-Odeid, Ibn Saud said that, in claiming it for Saudi Arabia, he was thinking of the interests of His Majesty’s Government as much as of his own, for no one but himself could keep order there. When crimes were committed there it was to him that the people applied for redress. 19. The King seemed very anxious to pass on to another subject. It appeared at first that he was wanting to evade the boundary question, but when the other subject came to be broached it was found to be a question of capital importance. What, the King asked, would happen to him in the case of war? Suppose war began in Europe, or in the Yemen, or anywhere? Could not His Majesty’s Government make some treaty or some other lesser undertaking with him ? It could be secret if they wished. 20. Mr. Rendel said that any such undertaking, and more especially any kind of secret guarantee, was precluded by the British constitutional system. ( 1 ) This reference should be to Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda.which would in any case make its eventual fulfilment uncertain. Sir R. Bullard added that His Majesty’s Government were obliged, as members of the League of Nations, to register all treaties with the League. Mr. Rendel then went on to say, as he had said the previous day, that he could hardly imagine any occasion on which a threat to Saudi Arabia would not be a threat to His Majesty’s Government, and added that this community of interests was a stronger bond than many a treaty. We had given too many promises in the past, under pressure of war in particular, and could not give one in this case. Sir Reader Bullard reminded the King once more of the terms of the Rome Agreement of 1927.^ His Majesty’s Government had recorded in writing that they regarded it as a “ vital imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea.” The King seemed to derive comfort from this conversation. Fourth Interview, March 22. 21. The King said that in this the last conversation before Mr. Rendel s departure he wished to speak about Palestine. The Arabs were now really alarmed by the Zionist policy. They feared that a Jewish Government would be established in Palestine and would include Transjordan in its scope, and they were even beginning to fear that there might be designs on Medina itself, the burial-place of the Prophet Mahomet. Some of these fears might be exaggerated, and due to irresponsible talk by individual Jews, but there was also genuine ground for apprehension, and he himself was very anxious about the question. Great Britain was powerful and could crush the Arab opposition, but he feared that there might be dangerous repercussions in other Moslem countries in which His Majesty’s Government had special interests, e.g., Egypt, Iraq and India. There were many enemies watching for an opportunity to injure Great Britain. The chief of these was, of course, Italy. The attempt that Italy was making to win recognition as the friend of Moslems in general and of the Arabs in particular was well known. The Italians had used the pilgrimage for piopa- ganda purposes, and had done their best to induce him to speak in praise of their pro-Moslem policy. He had resisted this attempt, and he had no belief whatever in Italian professions, for he knew what had happened in Tripoli and in Abyssinia, but there was a real danger from the Italians, nevertheless, if the troubles in Palestine should flare up again. Nor were the Turks inactive. They had many agents in Palestine, who never failed to rub it into the Arabs that the result of their revolt against the Turks was subordination to the Jews. The Zionist policy, as it was being carried out at present, was contrary to British interests, and that was one reason why he was against it. As a Moslem and an Arab he naturally sympathised with the Arabs of Palestine. He had suppressed these personal feelings hitherto out of friendship for His Majesty’s Government, and he could always suppress his feelings if policy required it. But the Zionist policy was not even in the interests of Great Britain. Moreover, His Majesty’s Government must realise that he stood alone, and that he had to think of his position in a Moslem world where he was the butt of much criticism, and where many of his co-religionists would not even admit that he was a Moslem. He felt that he had come to the end of what he could do in the matter of Palestine. 22. His Majesty was assured that his views would be communicated to His Majesty’s Government without delay. . . . 23 Ibn Baud said that he had one last question. Suppose that there was trouble in the Yemen and the Italians asked him about it. as they might very well do; what should he say ? Should he reply to this effect He did not propose to interfere in the internal affairs of the Yemen, and the Rome understanding of 1927, the relevant part of which had been communicated to him by the Italians as well as by the British, seemed to require them both to adopt a similar attitude of non-intervention. Mr. Rendel said that this reply seemed to meet the circumstances exactly.S l ^ THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0 f HIS^UHTAKNKTiqAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia).

Sir, Jed da, February 28, 1937. IN accordance with the instructions conveyed in the last paragraph of your telegram No. 135, dated the 5th December, regarding Mr. Philby's expedition into the Aden Protectorate, I had the honour to send you, in my telegram No. 9 1 1 of the 22nd February, an outline of Mr. Philby’s attitude. I now transmit a full summary of statements which he made to me in the course of a conversation on the 18th February. The collapse of his motor transport and, later, heavy floods delayed his return so long that he had only a few hours in Jedda before leaving for Mecca for the pilgrimage, but during that short time he called at the Legation and he talked freely about Ids journey. 2. As I anticipated, Mr. Philby was in his most heroic Prometheus mood. Indeed, he was even more difficult than I had expected, for to his desire to bring the light of science to mankind is now added a quite ferocious intention to expose the alleged duplicity of His Majesty’s Government towards the Arabs of the peninsula. He asserts that the second part of this programme was added only under the provocation which he considers he received from the Aden authorities. I did not enter upon a discussion of the pledges given or alleged to have been given in respect of Arab independence. I had never studied the McMahon correspondence closely from the point of view of the Arabian peninsula, and. in any case, it would be unwise to treat Mr. Philby as the protagonist of the Arab claims. Moreover, I had in hand the less nebulous argument that Shabwa lay outside the extreme limits ever claimed by the Saudi Government. Mr. Philby’s attitude towards that fact is shown in paragraph 6 of the enclosed record. He professes to demand independence for the Arabs in the Arabian peninsula without regard to the Saudi demands, of which he, however, claimed to be fully aware. He informed me that he had on his maps the two proposed frontiers in the south, the British and the Saudi. In that case, he was aware before he set out for Shabwa that it lay beyond the limits claimed by the Saudi Government. 3. Mr. Philby is unable to see that he treated Ibn Saud badly in obtaining an escort for topographical work and exploration in Saudi Arabia and using it, unknown to his patron, to enter territory outside Saudi Arabia. As to the Aden authorities, he regards their claim to Shabwa as a trespass on territory which was abandoned by His Majesty’s Government in favour of Arab independence in the McMahon correspondence. In that correspondence His Majesty’s Government agreed to recognise “ the independence of the Arab countries ” within the limits laid down by the Sherif Hussein, which included the whole of the Arabian peninsula except Aden and, possibly, the Arab States on the Persian Gulf, but they added the proviso : “ without prejudice to the existing treaties with Arab chiefs.' Probably Mr. Philby would say that His Majesty’s Government had no treaty then and have none now with the Arab chief of Shabwa, and regard that as the last word on a subject of great practical and legal complexity. 1 assume that the observations of the Chief Commissioner of Aden on Mr. Philby’s claims will be recorded in due course. At first sight it seems to me that there is just enough truth in Mr. Philby’s contention to afford a moral shelter behind which he can indulge his personal tastes and feelings and interests to the full. 4. Mr. Philby’s claim that from the political point of view his expedition was on all fours with that of Mr. Bertram Thomas is unfounded. It is true that Mr. Thomas was at the time in the employ of the Sultan of Muscat, but he had no official escort, and the Sultan had never given reason to anyone to suppose that he wished to increase his territory. Moreover, the whole of Mr. Thomas’s route lay to the east of the blue line which at the time of the McMahon [956 y—5]'1 K correspondence represented the legal western boundary of the territories of those Arab chiefs on the Persian Gulf with whom His Majesty s Government had treaties. Mr. Philby would probably say that the Turks had no authority to agree to the blue line, which took no account of their defeat at the hands of Ibn Sand, but he does not know that Ibn Baud has recently admitted that His Majesty’s Government saved him from being crushed by the Turks. fliis admission was made in the message transmitted through Sheikh Yusuf Yasm which I reported in my despatch No. 283, dated the 11th October. But in any case, Mr. Philby could not be expected to forgo an opportunity to use Mr. Thomas as a stick with which to beat His Majesty’s Government. 5. The statements recorded in paragraph 5 of the enclosure left little doubt in my mind that Mr. Philby did enter the territory of the King of the Yemen, and since he cannot accuse the King of encroaching on Arab territory, he will have to find another excuse for the encroachment which the King rightly resented. But he will probably think the purity of his intentions sufficient excuse. 6. Mr. Philby does not seem to have entered the band of territory lying between the proposed British and Saudi lines, but he may have gathered some information about it. In recent discussions with Fuad Bey I have claimed it for Aden and Oman on the ground that the four wells in it which are shown on our maps, viz., Sanau and Thamut in the Hadhramaut hinterland and Shisur and Tadhau in the hinterland of Oman, are not on Fuad Bey’s list of Murra wells, have never been claimed by the Saudi Government by name, and, according to the information in Thomas’s Arabia Felix, lie to the south of the Rub-al-Khali and in the steppe country which rises from the rim of the desert to the crests of the coastal range and are frequented almost exclusively by tribes to whom Ibn Saud lays no claim. It is unlikely that Mr. Philby has collected any better information on this point than Bertram Thomas, who passed through the territory in question and halted at Shisur, but he may make it more difficult for Ibn Saud to renounce his claim by representing the tribes thereabouts as entirely beyond the control of the authorities in the coastal States, but ready and willing to submit to Ibn Saud. Ibn Saud is so much more a statesman than Mr. Philby that I am hopeful that nothing Mr. Philby can say will influence him in this matter, the more so as, having repudiated responsibility for the expedition, he can hardly quote the results to his own advantage. I am more anxious lest the appearance of the promised attack on His Majesty’s Government in Mr. Philby’s next book should drag the question of the smaller Arab States in the Arabian peninsula into the vortex of controversy about the McMahon correspondence. 7. I do not propose to engage in a dispute on pan-Arab politics with Mr. Philby, nor to continue the discussion about his visit to Shabwa. The views of His Majesty’s Government have been conveyed to the Saudi Government, and Mr. Philby has also been informed of those views, and the matter had better, I suggest, be left there. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosure to Aden, Cairo, Jerusalem, Bagdad and Bushire. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. Tmclosure. Summary of Statements made by Mr. Philby about his Expedition to Shabwa and beyond, in the course of a Conversation which he had with His Majesty's Minister on February 18, 1937. IT was quite true that Ibn Saud had nothing to do with the expedition beyond instructing all local officials to assist him. Mr. Philby had defrayed all the expenses himself (and they had turned out to be much heavier than he had expected), though he had financed himself by drawing on Saudi treasuries, where they existed, and refunding the advances through his firm in Jedda. The object of the journey was purely scientific, and he had, in fact, collected a great mass of information which he hoped would be of use to science, and had established the position of over a hundred points. Throughout the expedition the only connexion he had had with Ibn Saud was that, as a matter of courtesy, whenever he was within reach of a Saudi telegraph station he sent a telegram to the King reporting the date of arrival and the probable date of departure.2. To show that the journey had originally no concern with politics, he could state that he had written all he had intended to say about the Hadhramaut before he started back from Shibam, i.e., before the breakdown of one of his cars compelled him to go to Mukalla to try to get a new back-axle. The chapter was colourless, in spite of the fact that he had ‘ ‘ seen a lot of things ' ’ about which he might have written. But after the reception he received when he applied to the Resident at Aden for assistance he had changed his mind. Having been attacked, he proposed to defend himself, and he would add chapters to his forth coming book which would tell the world the facts about the Aden Protectorate. He was prepared to give His Majesty’s Minister all these facts, but he also proposed to give them to the Saudi Government. 3. The criticism directed against his visit to Shabwa was entirely unjustified. His journey was on all fours with that of Bertram Thomas across the Rub-al-Khali. He was quite right in claiming that, apart from the Hadhramaut, his journey lay in unexplored, undemarcated territory. To claim Shabwa and those parts for the Aden Protectorate was fantastic, for no protection was afforded. Nor could the Aden authorities claim the virtue of leaving the people thereabouts to manage their own affairs, for they bombed them. The Aden attitude towards Shabwa was exactly like that of the Italians towards Walwal at the beginning of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, and British policy was no more honest than that of Italy had been. The British were trying to expand at the expense of the Arabs. 4. His policy remained what it had always been, viz., to try to obtain for the Arabs what they were promised early in the Great War. He had challenged His Majesty’s Government to publish the promises made then (the McMahon correspondence), but with their habitual cowardice they had refused. There were plenty of copies in Arabic to be had, but the English correspondence ought to be published. He would tell His Majesty’s Minister a “ secret ” : he used to possess copies of the correspondence in English, given to him by T. E. Lawrence, but they were stolen from him by a clerk of his in Jedda. 5. He was interested to hear (for the first time) that the King of the Yemen had protested to Ibn Sand, alleging that the expedition had entered Yemen territory at Jauf and Marib. He wondered how the King had heard about it. In point of fact, he had not gone to Marib, but had taken photographs and bearings from a height from which it was visible. (Mr. Philby evaded, or at least did not answer, the question whether the height in question was in Yemen territory.) 6. No. it was not quite correct to say that he was asking for more for Ibn Saud than Ibn Saud was asking for himself, though it was near the truth. What he wanted was the establishment of the promised Arab independence in the Arab Peninsula and the elimination of any foreign rule which conflicted with the promises. Mr. Philby claimed to know all about the British and Saudi proposals for the southern frontier of Saudi Arabia and to have the two lines marked on maps in his possession. When His Majesty’s Minister said that in that case he must have known that Shabwa lay well to the south of the proposed Saudi line, he said that the position of Shabwa on the map was a long way out, but he did not deny that Shabwa was even farther to the south than the map shows, and therefore at a greater distance from the extreme limits claimed by Ibn Saud than appeared from the map.(R33) Wt 20935/3704 15,000(2) 9/36 H &amp; Sp Gp 640 Communications on this subject should be addressed to— The Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l, and the following number quoted :— C 7 Rejerence to 'previous correspondence: Letter the Colonial Office of the i V/ Transmitted by direction of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. 7 A copy has also been sent to the ^ 0/ r ^' r~^C , / d , Colonial Office, Downing Street, 14 APR 1937 193 •' RECD. 1 S \PR 1937, .

Given Ibn Baud’s general cordiality and his sensitiveness over frontier question I suggest nothing is to be gained by pressing for a settlement of Quatar frontier at present the more so as I am sure that Saudi conception of physical features there differs considerably from ours. I realise advantage of having fixed frontiers in case of trouble, but it seems to me that in most unlikely event of Ibn Saud being an enemy, frontiers would not save Quatar and that in any other circumstances it is less objectionable to have an undefined frontier than to insist on definition at the risk of offending him. Papers follow by bag. Meanwhile I propose not to raise frontier issue again until instructed by you to raise it. Adaressed to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs No. 24.

Past experience, moreover, shows that the place has been a s ou rc e of c on- si derable trouble to the Shaikh, being used as a o vide letter from the Political Resident in 'the Persian Gulf to the Secretary to the Covtrnraent of India in the Foreign Department, No.232 dated 30th October 1878, and Ho.20 from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Secretly to the Government of India in the foreign Department, dated the 14th January 1379. resort by seceders from hia authority and as a refuge by pirates. If the Shaikh were now again to people the place, 4 it is probable that the settlers would again secede and would form a fresh cause of embarrassment to Shaikh 2aid. 3. From the point of view of British interests there appears at present to be no reason why the Government of India /- \ - 2 - India should lend their support to the enterprise* The sanction of His Majesty's Government has recently been asked to the conclusion of an agreement vide despatch Ho.77 Secret - eternal, dated 3lafe larch 1904, of which copy has been forwarded to you this day. with the 3haikh of ISl Kfctr, and if this proposal be approved, the chances of Turkish encroachments in this quarter w ill in the future be much reduced* There will be no reason for wishing to establish a port to rival those of 1 1 Katr, and Indeed it will probably be inadvisable that the Sha ikh of Abu habi should re-occupy a place which has been a cause of contention between himself and the Binthani family in the past, and the re-population of which might easily become a source of fresh quarrels in the future* 4. I’or the above reasons, the Government of India are inclined to think that in present circumstances the place should be left uninhabited and that, unless there are other strong reasons which have not been mentioned, there are, at the present time, no sufficient advantage in lending any encouragement to the re-ocoupf tion of the place by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, Before passing final orders in the matter, however, I am to enquire whether Colonel Kern ball's suggestion was actuated by any considerations other than those mentioned in his letter* I have the honour to be, Sir, Tour most obedient servant, Sd.

Sir, British Legation, Jedda, 23rd November, 1936. I have received several Foreign Office despatches regarding the possibility that oil may be found in the Ruba* al Khali and the bearing of that possibility upon the question of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. The latest of these despatches. No. 311 U 6686/260/91) dated October 29th, which was amended by Foreign Office telegram No. 125 dated November 9th, asks for my observations, and I now supplement the brief interim reply which I sent to Mr. Rendel in my letter of November 17th. 2. I would suggest, with regard to the assumption in the second half of paragraph 3 of your despatch No. 311, that nearly if not quite the whole of the Aden Protectorate hinterland lying between the frontier Ibn Saud wants and the latest line offered to him by His Majesty's Government lies to the south of the area covered by the definition in Article 2 of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company concession. It is true that the position of the southern end of the Dahana has never been fixed, but such evidence as we have seems to show that a line drawn south 30 degrees east from the southern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana would cut the coast well to the east of Dharbat All, the point of division between the Hadhramaut and Oman. In support of The Rt. Honourable Anthony Eden, MC. , MP., this/ Etc. , etc., etc.2 this contention I would cite Mr. Phirby*s 'The Empty Quarter”, page 344 and the first of the two end maps, from which it would appear that the Dahana proper ends somewhere - perhaps a considerable distance - to the north of Mr. Philby^ 1932 route. It is true that the Rumailah through which Mr. Philby passed is described by him at page 344 as ”generally regarded as a southerly continuation of the Dahna” and on the map as ”sand tract similar to Dahna”, but it is clear from his words that it is not called Dahna (Dahana) and both the statement at page 344 and the map indicate that there is a gap between the Dahana and the Rumailah. Thus it is possible that there is a considerable portion of the area desired by the Iraq Petroleum Company (i.e. any area in Saudi Arabia lying east of longitude 48 east and not already covered by a concession granted to some other company) which lies between the southern boundary of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company concession and the Violet Line - still more the Violet Line as modified by the latest offer of His Majesty's Government. 3. Even if the contention set forth in paragraph 2 above is correct I would not suggest that the Iraq Petroleum Company should be encouraged to apply for the unallotted area. On the contrary, I agree that such an application at this moment would increase Ibn Saud's desire to secure a larger share in the Ruba' al Khali than it suits His Majesty's Government to concede to him and perhaps complicate the issue by inspiring him with the suspicion that His Majesty’s Government have been biassed all along by the belief that there might be oil in the area in dispute. 4. According to the last paragraph of Mr. Rendel's note of October 20 th (Foreign Office despatch No.302 dated October 22nd), Mr. Longrigg proposes to push on with the concessions/3. concessions over Abu Dhabi, Muscat and the Aden Protectorate. It is assumed that if any such concession is obtained before a frontier agreement with Ibn Saud is concluded, it will not be worded in such a way as to imply a unilateral decision as to any area in dispute. I recognise, hov/ever, that this is only a reasonable attitude so long as an agreement is arrived at fairly soon, and that it is not desirable that procrastination should leave a potential oil area either undeveloped or exposed to the encroachment of an American company in virtue of a vague concession from Ibn Saud. 5. The prospects for the negotiations, when they are reopened, are not encouraging. Ibn Saud has been given satisfaction on several points which he had much at heart - the manumission of slaves, the equality of Arabic with English in the Treaty of Jedda, difficulties at Bahrain, and the control of the Legation dispensary and medical staff; on the frontier questions it is difficult for us to go farther than we have already gone; Fuad Bey Hamza*s enquiries about a loan met with a discouraging reception in the City; in the matter of the Hejaz Railway no solution is in sight; and in the three other major questions - Kuwait Blockade, landing facilities for aeroplanes, and the debt due to His Majesty’s Government, we want something from Ibn Saud and have nothing to offer in return. The only important factor that I can find on the other side is Ibn Saud’s undoubted desire to remain on good terms with His Majesty’s Government and it may be that having accepted aeroplanes and technical asoistance from the Italians as a gift he may feel called upon to be accommodating towards His Majesty's Government to emphasise his impartiality. The limitation which the doubt about the frontiers places upon the search for oil and/and minerals may also serve as an inducement to speed in negotiation. I would not place either on one side of the argument or on the other Sheykh Yusuf Yasin f s personal enquiry ahout the training of Saudi aviation personnel in the United Kingdom as I cannot 'believe it to 'be a serious proposal. 6. Fuad Bey Hamza returned to Jedda on November 22nd, while this despatch was being written, and I hope to have an opportunity within the next few days of reopening the frontier questions, beginning with the Nejd-Trans-Jordan frontier, which offers the best prospect of a settlement, and passing at once to the question of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers, where the point of departure will be the position taken up by Sir Andrew Ryan, viz. that he was given reason to expect that a compromise would be proposed by the Saudi Government and that it is for t^hem to produce alternative proposals to those which he placed before them at Riyadh - see, for instance, paragraphs 6 and 9 of the record of his conversation with Sheykh Yusuf Yasin on May 30th, a copy of which was sent to the Foreign Office in his despatch No.160 dated June 1st.

In the meantime it may be useful to give my present views subject to any arguments that Rendel may bring forward. This letter, which I am sending across to Bahrain to catch the Imperial Airways there, should be with you in about 10 days* time, and it can conveniently form a basis of reference for any telegrams v/hich Rendel and I may wish to send. It will also be useful for Rendel to have my views in a concrete form. 3. I note that the War Office and the Air Ministry (as well as the Foreign Office) are anxious to come to terms with Bin Saud with a view to his co-operation in various directions. Bin Baud’s attitude is of course important, but so I must point out is that of the Rulers of the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf, and the importance of the Arab coast, which is now the M Suez Canal of the Air H , and where there are important oilfields springing up, was indicated in ray demi-official letter No.82-3 of the 18th January 1937 to Metcalfe, copy forwarded to you under Printed Letter No.83-S of same date. We must therefore be careful that in retaining the co-operation of Bin Saud, / r who after all is not our protege, we do not in any way sacrifice / ■ ^OI. DeSt ~ 2 MAR 133? rs; C. Walt on Esquire, CB. ,MC., The India Office, London. 1 OFFICE-2 sacrifice the interests of the Arab Shaikhs whom we are bound legally and morally to protect. 3. With regard to a further possible offer which it is now proposed should be made to Bin Saud, I entirely concur in the doubts of the India Office on the subject. As you are aware in this affair we have all along been M on the run'. There was first The Green Line, in two stages, (Foreign Office tele- grajm Bo.8, dated the 16th January 1935, to Jedda), then The Brown Line and The Yellow Line, (Foreign Office tel egram^Bo .70, dated the 1st May 1935, to Jedda}, and finally the ’Ryadh* Line, (jedda despatch No*351, dated the 10th December 1935). ^ All these Lines, variegated in hue as they were, had one thing « in common: they gave more and more territory to Bin Saud. I quite agree that there are occasions when in order to gain that one 1 s object one must bargain, and/the only way one can find out what terms the other side is really prepared to accept is by a series of offers and counter offers, each side lowering its terms until finally a bargain is struck, in exactly the same way when one buys a Persian carpet 1 In the present bargaining over the Arabian •carpet*, as you know, I Inave been far from being intransigent, and have always been ready to agree, as far as possible, to any proposal which could serve to induce the Saudi Government to come to terms. 4. But surely the time has now come for this bargaining to cease ? It is the essence of bargaining that there should be 'give and take', but up to the present it is His Maj esty* s Government who have been doing all the ’giving* and Bin Saud all the ’taking*. Moreover His Majesty’s Government have categorically informed the Saudi Government that their last offer was the final one. The relevant sentence occurs in paragraph /-3- paragraph -13 of the Foreign Office despatch of the 23rd October 1935 to Ryan at Jedda, and reads as followsi- M You should then proceed formally to put forward the new offer which His Majesty’s Government, in the light of the foregoing considerations, have now resolved to make, emphasising once more that it is made with every desire to meet the wishes of King Abdul Aziz to the furthest possible extent, but adding in no ambiguous terms that it represents a final concession which His Majesty’s Government will not be able to increase. I trust that you will thus dispel as far as possible any impression in the King’s mind that, in now putting forward proposals much more favourable to him than the two territorial concessions already offered, His Majesty’s vaovern- ment would be likely to yield still further in response to continued bargaining on his part. As you are aware, this is a point to which the India Office attach much importance 1 *. If after this His Majesty’s Government make another offer, the effect in other areas where we have to negotiate with the Saudi Government will not I imagine be too happy, (though of course that is not my concern), but as regards the Gulf, (which is my concern), I have no hesitation in saying that in my opinion it would be most unfortunate. There is at least one important question, besides the Saudi frontier now under consideration, which we have to settle with the Saudi Government, e.g. the Saudi Blockade against the Shaikh of Kuwait, for the raising of which His Majesty’s Government have a special responsibility by reason of their assurance to the shaikh in 1929 (colonial Office telegram dated the 25th /25th July 1929 to the Political Resident), and there will doubtless be other questions in the future. The Saudi Govern ment are already very difficult to deal with. Only last year, for instance, in the course of these very negotiations over the frontier question, they stated categorically that they had a letter from the Shaikh of Q,atar to Bin Saud, surrendering certain territory to the latter, but when asked to produce it they had to admit, after a delay and waste of time of some six months, that it never existed (vide correspondence connected with Jedda telegram 2Jo.74, dated the 31st May 1936, to the Foreign Office). A further offer now from His Majesty’s Government, after the final offer referred to above, will I that am afraid give the Saudi Government the impress ion^in any ,vith regard to the Gulf negotiations^they have only to stick to their position long enough tn order to get what they want out of us. The undesirability of such an impression is of course obvious. 5. So much for general ccnsideraticns. With regard to the form in which a further offer can now take, this would x seem to be as follows:- (a) Towards the East or South in the direction of Mus c at. (b) Towards the Gulf in the direction of the territories of the Shaikhs of Q,atar and of the Trucial Coast. (c) Rendel*s suggestion of a compromise with regard to Khor el Odeid, such as free transit for Bin Saud. 6. With regard to (a). The position is that the section J-G.H of the Riadh Line was subject to confirmation of the Sultan of Muscat (paragraph 2 of Foreign Office telegram of the 18th November 1935). A further advance on that Line was suggested at the end of paragraph 2 of India Office telegram / l,l'«U|P|fll!#J|lVUJIi li Ml-5- telegram No # 967, dated the 19th March 1936, to the Government oflndia, and was concurred in by the Government of India and myself (Government of India telegram No.757, dated the 23rd March 1936) provided that the Sultan of Muscat agreed, which then appeared likely. I instructed Watts to approach the Sultan and the latter’s reaction is as reported in his letter of the 15th 1936 to Watts, copy forwarded under my Express letter No.543-S, dated the 4th July 1936. Briefly, the Sultan refused to bind himself to any boundary, and I saw nothing for it but to postpone any further approach until he returned to his capital, which I hoped would be last October. In point of fact the Sultan postponed his return for another five months and has only just got back. Watts is for the moment sick at Karachi but can again tackle the Sultan v/hen he gets back to Muscat, which should be within the next fortnight. 7. With regard to (b). As you are aware the question of the frontiers of ^atar and of the Trucial Shaikhdoms has been exhaustively gone into both on the map and on the ground, Loch paying various visits to the Shaikhs concerned as well as flying over the relevant areas, and nothing was withheld from Bin Saud to which he could advance any reasonable claims. I am therefore definitely of opinion that no more territory can be given to Bin Saud in this direction without our sacrificing the legitimate interests of the Shaikhs in question, which naturally I assume is not the intention of His Majesty’s Government. 8. With regard to (c). I see various strong objections to this proposal. U) /-6 (1) We can only make it by pressing the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to give something to Bin Saud without arty quid pro quo whatever, and the effect of this both on him and on the other Shaikhs of the Arab Coast, 'who will of course get to hear of it, would be distinctly prejudicial to our prestige. (2) The granting to Bin Saud of free transit at Khor el Odeid would tend to undermine the position of the Bahrain Government in charging transit dues on Saudi goods entering Hasa. (3) Bin Saud having been given the privilege of free transit at Khor el Odeid would then (if I know anything of his tactics, which from an impersonal point of view I admire) press for a Saudi official to be stationed at the Khor in order to see that this free transit was observed. This would give him to some extent a footing in the Gulf, and a means of extending his influence and authority over the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast, which it is part of His Majesty^ Government’s considered policy to prevent - vide e.g. paragraph 4 (a) of India Office * letter No.P.Z.4535, dated the 12th January 1935 to the Foreign Office. (4) For the moment very little traffic goes through Khor el Odeid in view of the desolate area behind it, and at present the Khor 4s apparently only fit for small craft. But it might be possible by dredging and buoying to make it a passable port for steamers. If at any time oil was struck by the California Oil Company within a reasonable distance of the Coast it might pay them to develop the Khor, ae at present they are considering the development of Has Tanurah, and run /run a pipe-line to it: as we know pipe-lines in these days can cover considerable distances. If this occurred free transit of the oil might mean considerable loss to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. Rend el may of course produce arguments to modify the above views but subject to this qualification they are as stated. I am sending copies of this to Metcalfe and Loch. * sent under Printed letter No.240-S of 20th February 1937*3 V- DRAFT &gt; DESPATCH I 4 1 1 Donning Street* February, 19S7. • 6 or the 1‘Jth oi* January* and to have tae honour to refer to your previous telegraphic correiii'Oiuieace, and to eastern and oouth-e&amp;stern boundaries of Saudi-Arabia has recently formed the subject of further discussion by the Departments concerned. 2.

Moreover, it is likely that the effects oi such developments* in so far as they arise from Arab opposition, would not be confined to Palestine aloii% but that the relations of His Majesty’s Government with the independent Arab States throughout Arabia would be adversely affected; and there is the obvious possibility that Italian activities in Arabia would be directed, in such an event, to widening the breach.

Philby returned just in time to proceed on pilgrimage but he called on me and talked freely. As I feared he is in his most self-righteous and aggressive mood. He says Ibn Sand was in no way responsible for expedition to which that of Bertram Nhomas affords an exact parallel. He had intended to dismiss Hadramaut in one uncontroversial chapter in his forthcoming book but having been attacked by Aden he intended to fight and was adding suitable chapters. To judge by his conversation the line he will take will be that in claiming Shabwa and those parts for Aden Protectorate His Majesty’s Government are violating McMahon’s promises and trying to expand at the expense of nrabs and that they neither protect nor control them and in fact know nothing about them. 2. Philby did not deny that he knew Shabwa lay to the South of the extreme limits claimed by Saudi Arabia. To my comment that he seemed to be claiming for Ibn aaud more than Ibn baud claimed for himself he said this was not quite correct: he claimed promised Arab independence in Arabian peninsula and elimination of any foreign rule which conflicted with promises. 3.

K 7- u SEEN _ • POLITICAL COMMirr^m. 8 MAR Previous i^apers :— at It will be remembered that/the end of 1935 it was decided to make a final offer to Ibn Saud in regard to the boundary question in the hope of reaching a satisfactory settlement (see the note at P.Z.438/36). This final offer was made to Ibn Saud by Sir Andrew Ryan when he visited Riyadh in November 1935, but unfortunately it did not secure the desired result. On the contrary the Saudis accepted it not so much as a final offer but as a basis for further bargaining, and nothing has happened since then except desultory conversations from time to time at Jedda between the Saudis and H.M.Minister. 3643 1000 3.35 2. The Saudis have taken the opportunity of the/_n ^ V the arrival of the new Minister, Sir Reader Bullard, to raise the general question again (see the Jedda telegrams of 29th December at Flag B). The matter was accordingly discussed at a meeting of the Middle East Sub-Committee on February 1st, and in the course of the meeting the War Office, Air Ministry and Foreign Office displayed an unexpected and vigorous unanimity in pressing that the matter should be re-examined in order to see whether some further concession of a generous nature might not be offered to Ibn Saud with a view to retaining and consolidating the friendship of Ibn Saud. They suggested that the retention of this friendship was of vital importance on wideopyoad political grounds in view of the unsettled and dangerous state of affairs in the Middle East. They pointed out that the report of the Palestine Commission will very probably be unsatisfactory to the Arab world, and that H.M.G. may find themselves compelled to take action in Palestine which will incur the hostility of Arabs throughout the Middle East. During the last Palestine troubles Ibn Saud behaved very well towards H.M.G. and exerted a good deal of useful pacifying influence on Arabs generally, and a similar influence may be badly needed again before very long. They also referred to the menace of Italian activities in the Middle East and the desirability of not doing anything which might throw Ibn Saud into the arms of the Italians. 3. All this is very convincing as a general proposition, but it is perhaps doubtful (a) whether further offers on our part to Ibn Saud in respect of the boundary question would have the effect either of promoting an early settlement or of cementing his friendship (they might merely be taken as a sign of weakness); (b) whether there is in fact any further concession which we can offer to Ibn Saud without letting down our own protegees, the Sheikhs of/Minute Paper. Department of Qatar and Abu Dhabi and the Sultan of Muscat. 4. As a result of the divergence of views expressed at the meeting the discussion was inconclusive but Mr.Rendel of the Foreign Office pointed out that he was shortly going to undertake a private tour in the Middle East with his wife in the course of which he was going to stay for a few days with Colonel Fowle at Bushire and with Colonel Loch at Bahrein. He suggested that he should discuss the whole question with these political authorities in the Persian Gulf with a view to discovering whether in their view and in the light of the arguments adduced by the Foreign Office and Service Departments they thought it would be possible and desirable to make any further offers to Ibn Saud. In particular he would discuss with them whether the line already finally offered to Ibn Saud could definitely be regarded as a line beyond which the Sheikhs concerned had really firm territorial claims. such discussions to take place, and of course it would in any case have been desirable at an early stage to obtain the further views of the political authorities in the Gulf. A private telegram has accordingly been sent to Colonel Fowle and Colonel Loch, informing them that they may expect Mr.Pendel to discuss these matters with them and giving them an indication of the provision -al departmental views on the subject (see the telegram dated 12th February, flag C). 6. After his visit to the Gulf Mr.Rendel is going ! on to Jedda, and he will there be able to discuss the matter further with Sir Reader Bullard. In the light of these discussions and of the views expressed by the 5. It was obviously impossible to refuse to allow Political/ 531UB 5000 10/3G(2)/ Political Resident it will be necessary to take a final decision whether any action, and if so what, can be taken in the sense suggested by the Foreign Office and Service Departments. 7. The Colonial Office are of course also concerned in this matter in regard to the northern boundary of the Aden Protectorate. Here also the other departments are anxious to consider the offer of further concessions. The Colonial Office are consulting the Resident at Aden on similar lines. opinion as to the desirability of consolidating oar friendship with Ibn Saad, and can be none now as to the importance of retaining it at the present juncture. We are indebted to him for his successful efforts in inducing the Palestine Arabs to call off the strike last autumn. He is, of course, being courted by the Italians but apparently without much success up to date. Up to the present, indeed, Saudi policy has been based on the principle of friendship with but it might be put to a severe test if there were Arab disturbances in Palestine on a larger scale than last year, or in the event of a European war. sense of the Fiddle East Committee was in favour of a generous settlement with Ibn Saud in regard to his eastern frontiers. The difficulties emerge when concrete suggestions begin to be considered, because we have as a matter of fact already offered everything of importance | which we have to give. The only further points which j the P-0, mentioned were - (1) Jebel Nakhsh, near the base of the Qatar peninsula on its west coast; There has never been any difference of In view of such consideratios the generalMinute Paper.

It therefore seems difficult to believe that anything farther which we coaid offer v/oald make the difference between a generous and a niggardly offer. It will, I think, be a good thing for the political authorities in the Gulf and Mr. Rendel to discuss the matter informally during the latter’s visit We shall then obtain the official views of the Political Resident. iCf. X, 00, 4 3 S€’GN POL:TiO/&gt;L- OOMMiTT^it 8 MAR.4- 3 EASTERN AND SOUTHERN BOUNDARIES OP SAUDI-ARABIA. THE SUB'-CQivIMITTDE had under consideration a copy of a letter from the Foreign Office to the India Office 5 together with copies of telegrams to ana from His Majesty’s Minister at Jeada (Paper No. M.E.(O) 214) ana telegraphic correspondence between the Secretary of State for the Colonies ana the Resident ac Aaen (Paper Ho. M.B.(O) 216). MR. RENDSL said that the present situation in regara to the Saudi Arabian boundaries was full of possible dangers ? and the Foreign Office felt that every effort should be made to bring about an early and definite settlement. He instanced the activities of certain oil concerns working in the neighbourhood of the most controversial portion of the frontier, i.e., the base of t.ie Qatar peninsula. Petroleum Concessions, Ltd. (which was the Iraqi Petroleum Company under another form) had already been given a concession, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, in tne Qatar Peninsula and he understood that operations were likely to begin in the Jebel Nakhsh, which was one of the pojnts most in dispute. He referred to the difficulties which might have arisen when the Imperial Airways air liner ’’Horso” had been forced to land in an area where the frontier was hotly disputed. There were many reasons for settling this frontier question at an early date. One factor was the effect the Report of the Royal Commission on Palestine would have on the Arabs. Even if the Report was consiaered to deal satisfactorily with the claims of the Arabs it was doubtful whether the decision taken by His Majesty's Government would give satisfaction to the Moslem world. If tne Report or the decision of His Majesty’s Government was unsatisfactory to the Arabs, it v/as generally agreed that there would be worse riots inPalestine then those which occurred last summer. The attitude of the independent Arab states to His majesty’s Government was? therefore, very important* It might be that we should find ourselves in an embarrassing position in our relations with Ibn Saud, and it was quite con ceivable that most Arab countries would become hostile to us* There was much material to suggest that if things went wrong over Palestine the Arabs would be prepared to make friends with other countries* It would be better, therefore, to settle the Saudi-Arabian frontier questions before we ran the risk of alienating Arab opinion, and a settlement with Ibn Saud on the frontier question might weigh favourably with him if the Palestine situation developed unfavourably. The arguments for meeting Ibn gaud as far as possible were, therefore, very strong* There were two areas in the northern portion of the frontier which Ton Gaud regarded as most important for his purposes, but on which His i ajesty’s Government had not been able to give way - the Jebel Wakhsh and the Khor al Odaid* It would be difficult to recognise Ibn Paud f !5 claim to the Jebel iTakhsh, as geographically it had always been regarded as part of Qatar and had been definicely Included in the map attached to the Qatar oil concessions* as regards Khor al Odaid, the Government of India had apparently recognised the claim of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi to the territory in this vicinity* It could, therefore, not be given *co Ton Gaud except at the expense of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi* It might also be awkward if Ibn Scud was given an outlet to the Persian Gulf, and in any case it would break the chain of British protected states from Bahrein. -15-It uas, tliorefore, di:Lficu?-t to ^ivo. Ton Sand any concsssions in the two areas specified above. It mir,ht, however ? he possible to offer Ibn Baud free transit in the Jdior al Odaid, although there were some doubts as to whether this was navigable. His fajesty’s Minister at Jedda had put forward for consideration a suggestion that His Majesty’s Government might conceivably offer a further concession at Sufuk and on the borders of the .iden Protectorate. Something might be done in these areas, although difficulty world arise if it was established that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi had a better right than Ibn Gaud to Sufuk area. It was difficult to define claims to territory in this area and Mr. Rondel recalled that whilst we had originally claimed that the wells at Banayinn belonged to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, it was subsequently discovered that this claim could not be established. Concessions in the eastern area of the frontier were not of much interest to Ibn Baud, and concessions on the southern portion affected the question of our responsibility for protecting the Aden tribes. He wished,,however,to impress cn the Gub--Committee the necessity of considering the reasons why it was important to settle the question of the Saudi-Arabian frontiers, and why it was necessary that we should do all we could to keep Ibn Gaud on our side in viev; of the dangerous possibilities in regard to Palestine. Ibn Gaud was a key factor in the Kiddle Hast situation. He had played up very well indeed in regard to Palestine over the last six month.:,, but he could not be expected to continue this attitude if he got the feeling that the /Arabs v/oro not 'jo11ia S'i'aare deal* --C would v/gIcoiag the sufA'esticns of the Gub-CoM'Aittec for dealizid' ^ r i °-' 1 this problcri. IdhUfhif-ju COLOl-TIvL OSBORIdi said that the v/ar Office stronplp sup ao:? fed the Forei';a Office suggestion ior an early settlement of the frontier question. He emphasised that the Far Office took the view that the time had now come when vr e should consider Ibn Baud T s frontiers as a single problem in which Imperial and not local interests p r c dominated. In the past ahere had been a tendency for too much consideration to be given to purely local interests. Strategically, the Middle East was increasing in importance Ibn Gaud’s friendship had been a very important factor during the past year. His friendship would bo even more important in future, and, in fact, without his co-operasion there wos much trouble ahead for us in the hear Hast. The V/ar Office, therefore, felt very strongly that the time had come for us to stop cuibbling v'ith Ibn Sana on I minor matters. It was now nocesse.ry so take a broaaer view and to clear up our frontier disputes with him by saying what we could not give him, for example, 'atar and ICior al Odaid and, unless there are strong reasons to the contrary, to give him what ho wanted elsewhere. Ibn Gaud’s friendship during the next ten years would be of much more importance to us than a few hundred miles of desert or oven oil bearing areas. CAP if. II! HI ILL If 3 said that he could not say whether Xhor al Odaid was navigable without a detailed survey. It might be that a deep-water channel existed.-18- From the strategical point ol view he did not consider that objection need be taken to Ibn baud obtaining access to the Persian Gulf at Khor al Jdaid 9 since he already has an outlet on | that Gulf to the west of the Qatar Peninsula* and his acquisition of a further outlet of doubtful value to the east of that Penin sula would not materially alter the strategical positiono v7ING COMMANDER RUSSELL said that the Air Ministry agreed with the War Office view* Whether Jebel Nakhsh or the Khor al Odaid were included in the concessions appeared to them to be mainlya political matter* but they supported the War Office argu ment that we should give Ibn baud whatever concession was possible* to ensure a final settlement of the frontier question as a whole* As regards the South-V/estern border* however* he hoped that it would be unnecessary to give more than had already been decided upon* MR * REilDEL was some T vhat surprised at the importance which the Saudis were now attaching to the South-western end of the frontier. Luring the discussions in 1935 Fuad Hamza had not seemed muc h disturbed about our proposals in this sector. On the other hand* Philby had of course recently passed through these areas* and this might have somewhat stimulated the Saudis to place their claims higher* Meanwhile, he was not sure that our own case was really quite water-tight in this area* He was inclined to think that a compromise line might still be found somewhere between parallels 17 and 18 at the South-Western end of the frontier, and suggested various possibilities with refer- * ence to the map which was before the meeting. His impression* however* was that if we could get a settlement at the Northern end of the line, the rest of the line ought not to present insuperable difficulties.-19- *r ® v . Meanwhile&gt; in cf‘ the new international situation and the dcnger threatening from Pol-stiue» he felt that the prohlem ou^ht to he dealt with generously and as a whole, and that ''e should endeavour to give Thn Saud as much as ws could, without,however, any undue or unreasonable surrender* MR, CLaUSCN Raid that the India Office would be In agreement with evsrything said in regara to treating this problem on a broad basis* As regards hr* Rendel f s remarks on xhe difficulties resulting from oil concessions, it was necessary to keep in mind that the Standard Oil Company who had been £ ranted the Bahrein concession, hod shown every desire to keep in with his kajesty s Government, nor was it considered that the Petroleum Concessions Limited would cause any trouble* Ion r aud 1 s a.ttj tude to the Palestinian difficulties was outside the sphere of the India Office* It was, however, arguable whether further concessions to him would make him more ready to co-operate over Palestine. He might be more ready to co-operate if he felt that there was still something left for us to offer. The foreign Office and War Office seemed to be of opinion that we should take our courage in our hands and offer as much as we could to Tbn Baud with a view to reaching a final settlement. This, however, was the conclusion reached in November, 1935, before fir Andrew Ryan had his discussions with the Baud!

At that time, we had, it was true, gone a long way to meet Ibn Baud, since we had abandoned the principle of trying to hold him bach against a vacuum, making small concessions one by one, mid h.d agreed only 'oo claim a line up to which our own prot6g6s had some sort of claim. \/c had thus made what appeared at first sight to be a large concession, but we had in fact only done what would have become inevitable in any case, since we Imew that it was neither legally nor practically possible to hoop ibn laud out of territory to which no one else could put forward a reasonable claim.Tv* But tlio situation now v/ac differont ? since tlic v/Iiole inter-national 'baclcoround had chanced. Since Sir .indrev/ Byan’s visit to Riyadh, Italian penetration in AraMa had become a far more serious dancer, and it was by no means impossible that new trouble in Palestine would lead to the Arabian rulers beinp greatly tempted to throw in their lot with Italy. Idoreover, the situation in Europe had become infinitely more dangerous so that it had become more important than it had appeared a year and a half ago to looh at this problem in the light of major Imperial strategy in the event of a European war breaking out. It seemed essential therefore that we should now cease to look at the natter from the local point of view and con sider it mainly from its Imperial and international aspect. If the situation in Palestine deteriorated again - as was very probable - and Arabian and Moslem opinion became hostile to us in consequence, we should bo in a much weaker position than we were in at present to deal with Ibn Saud over this frontier. Would it not then be wiser to try to get a setelement with him now - even if it involved further concessions - than to find ourselves obliged to make possibly much greater concessions to him later and virtually under pressure in the hope of buying back his friendship? IS. CLAPSOB* did not see how anything further could be offered at present. He thought that His hajest 3 r? s Minister at oedda had already been authorised to ask Son As regards the eastern portion of the frontier any concessions v/ould involve us in difficulties with the Crucial coast states, the sum total of which was an Imperial interest which must bo considered.

LiRo RRHDSL was anxious that this question should not he regarded as one where the points of view of different Departments must he at variance with each other* All the Departments represented had the same interest in furthering a solution* He agreed that it might he extremely diffi cult to make further concessions to Ibn °aud, and that it was of course essential to maintain the just rights 01 our proteges*. But it was important to he absolutely sure what those rights were* and essential to avoid any risk of our finding ourselves in difficulties with Ibn Saud in defence of claims which were not absolutely sound. He suggested therefore that the main argument advanced by the War Office representative - i. e* that new Imperial and international considerations now made it essential to treat the question as a whole on the broadest possible basis with a view to making the greatest possible concessions to Ibn Saud without violating our promises to our ownclients - shouli be put to the local authorities. He felt that if these 'aide principles v/ere clearly put before the British authorities in the Persian Gulf, they mipht look at the whole natter from a cone 1 /hat different angle, and it night then be possible to review the claims of our clients and see whether they v/ere in fact absolutely sound, e.g. in the case of the claim of the Sheikh of i,bu bhabi to the hhor al Odaid and to the well at Sufuk, and m regard to the claims of the Aden Protectorate tribes to the wide belt of territory which we were claiming to the forth, of the ’Vadi Hadhramaut.

If the meeting felt that it night do good, he would be very glad to out before Colonel Towle and Colonel Loch 'he considerations which he had advanced, and discuss the whole matter with them on these lines, to see whether anything further could be done. The matter could then oc dealt with by telegraph, and if necessary he could further discuss the Question with Sir R. Bullard on his arrival at Jcdda. Ileanwhile he suggested that the Colonial Office .might like to send a despatch to the Resident at . den drawing his attention to the wide Imperial and international considerations which now made it necessary to make every possible effort to settle the frontier Question cuickly and to make sure of Ibn Sand’s friendship while we still could.

South-eastern Boundaries of Saudi Arabia. His majesty’s Government have carefully considered position reached in negotiations ana see little prospect of reaching settlement, which tney regaru as very desirable, more especially in view of existing international situation in Lea Sea area, unless far more extensive offer is maae to Ion Baud, than that hitherto contemplated. They have never denied that hurra tribe was predominantly under Saudi influence ana propose now to accept Ibn Baud’s authority over this tribe as one of main faictors in the situation. Political Agent, Koweit, has now received information from Beduin with hurra connec tions which shows.(a) that great number of wells on Fuad Hamza’s list are probably nurra wells; (b) that dira of hurra tribe extends in south-east to Babkhat hijora which is not shown on maps but appears on sketch-map furnished by Political Agent as approximately at intersection of parallel 20 ana meridian 54. From this point tribal boundary runs in south-westerly curve to point apparently twenty to twenty-five miles south of Shanna whence it Cent 10 p.m. 9th October, 1935proceeds in north-westerly curve cutting violet line. 2° In these circumstances Jiis Majesty’s Government consider Ibn Saud might now be offered an area which in norths east and south will correspond closely with Murra dira# it is not proposed to offer him sovereignty over hurra dira as such but rather to make latest information basis of new and final offer while advancing positive claims of british proteges as irremovable obstacles to any Saudi demand for extension of this very reasonable and generous proposal. 3o This proposal will entail substantial con cessions to Ibn Saud in northern sector but in south it will not involve (and there is no intention of offering) concession of any territory to south of line running from intersection of violet line and parallel 13 to intersection of meridian 52 and parallel 19 (area north of which has already been offered) and thence to intersection of meridian 54 and parallel 20. This should meet your minimum requirements as set forth in paragraph 3 of Ingram’s note of 19th August accompanying your despatch under reference. 4o His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda will visit Ibn Saud at Riyadh in November and it is very desirable that fresh instructions should be ready before he leaves England about 25th October. Please therefore telegraph at very early date any obser vations on above new proposals.-4- ) CYPPILR TSLEGRAI.l from the Resident at Aden to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

Addressed to the Secretary Of State for the Colonies repeated to the British Minister at Jedda. Your telegram of the 15th March. Aden is concerned only with Boundary line West of approximately longitude 53. In paragraph 8 of Ingrams’ note of 19th August, 1935, forwarded to you with Lake’s secret despatch of the 20th August, 1935, certain principles v/ere proposed to govern our attitude regarding this frontier of which most important was that no steppe land or territory occupied By our triBes to the north of Hadhramaut valley should Be surrendered. I agree with this view and in accordance with it line proposed in your telegram to me No. 80 of 1935 represents the utmost concession that can Be made. Line suggested By Fuad Hamza would violate this principle as it would cut through territory of Mahra Manahil Awamir and Seiar triBes. The first of these is racially and politically connected with Qishn, the second and fourth with Mukalla and the third with Kathiris and prospectively thus with Aden Protectorate. The proposed line in this sector cannot Be ? therefore carried further south without giving Dha footing within outlying Border of Hadhramaut and a possible opening for further extension of his influence that would have politicalljr a disturbing effect on treaty chiefs and their people in that part of the Protectorate. There would also Be a likelihood of interference with grazing and watering rights of triBes concerned. These-6- developraents would thus adversely affect “both Imperial and local interests. I am also strongly opposed to any 'boundary that intersects tribal territory. Our experience, of divided control over Audhali tribe showed it leads to constant discontent and unrest, and I recommend His Majesty’s Government insists on retention of all tribal territory chief(s) of Aden Protectorate intact within our border. 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. 18 th January, 1937.,' V S (COPIES CIRCULATED) Dated Risher, 14th January, 1937» RaceiTed I4th January, 1937, 12—46 point.

Your despatch No. 350 of 9th Docerlber. In conversation on 26th December Fuad Bey who had just returned from Riyadh represented Ton Saud as having said to him that never before had his relations with His Majesty's Government been on so satisfactory a basis. Language was in any case vague but clearly meant to do very friendly. According to Fuad, Ibn Saud seems to think that his attitude over Palestine has convinced His Hajesty’s Government of his sincerity and desire to help. On the other hand Fuad appeared to imply that Ibn Saud had deserved well of His Majesty’s Government and had more than repaid concessions made to him in regard to treaty of Jedda. All this was background to frontier discussion (see my immediately following telegram) which made no advance.-3- From SAUDI ARABIA Decypher. Sir R. Bullard (Jedda) 29th December, 1936 D.

He had no counter r)roi)csals to make to the latest offer of His Majesty’s Government, claimed that southern boundary prouosed by Saudi Government was based on essential needs of tribes, and professed indifference to suggestion that line along longitude 55 east might be moved eastwards, on the ground that the country thereabouts is desert. Taking advantage of the change of ministers he tried the transparent manoeuvre of nretending that His Majesty’s Government had always been most keen about the Khor al-Odaid and much less so about the Jabal Naksh which fjaudi Government regarded as most important.

(2) Meanwhile it should he considered whether His Majesty 1 s G-overnment could afford to offer further slight concessions at Sufuk and on borders of Oman and Aden protectorate. (3) I know the difficulties in the second suggestion and I am extremely doubtful whether such concessions would induce Ibn Saud to make a formal renunciation of the Jabal Naksh, but the alternative seems to be to do nothing.

With reference to our conversation on the subject quoted above I am writing formally to state that I have been instructed by His Majesty's Government to iniorm Your Highness that tney are endeavouring to negotiate a treaty with His Majesty Ibn Saud which would determine amongst other matters the Muscat-S&amp;udi Frontier. fc. The negotiations cover the wnole question of the South and Eastern Frontiers of Sauai Arabia and are part of wider negotiations which, it is hoped, will consolidate the cordial relations existing between His Majesty's Government and Ibn Saud but as parts of the Frontier to be negotiated are of interest to Muscat His Majesty's Government desire to inform Your Highness of the present position. 3.

J* hs regards the definition of the western Boundary of \ his Jtate it will be noted that tho bultan is not prepared to commit himself at present* This does not appear an unreasonable attitude to take up in view of the fact that, as pointed out by His nighness, no attempt has ever been made previously to define the lind boundary of any part of the Muscat Jtate. The difficulty here is probably similar to what I gather has been the case in many other parts of Arabia where Rulers have been asked to work oai2 r\ ou*t a boundary in trhe Western meaning of bbe 'tenn wnich lo them has been hitherto an unheard of proposition. 4 # regards the question of his acceptance or not of the various boundaries proposed to be offered to ibn Saud by His Majesty's Government the Sultan's replies are not satisfactory. It will be seen from paragraphs 4 and 5 of his letter that he is evading the issue for his statement is not a definite reply to the questions asked him. 5. From what I have seen of His Highness I believe tha the real reason for his unwillingness to give a straight forward answer to the points raised concerning the Saudi- Muscat Frontier is chiefly his reluctance to take the trouble to plot on the map the lines of the various boundaries suggested. When discussing the matter with him at Dhofar I showed him on a map I had taken with me the tracings of the three different proposed boundaries and he at once declared he would have no objection to the line described in paragraph 4 of my letter to him No. C/63 i.e. the line joining the ooints C. D. £• G. H. and continued thence to the intersectio T of Parallel 18° and Meridian 46 u fiast, since, as he stated, this came nowhere near the western limits of his State. I offered to leave my map with the various points marked with His Highness but he declared it was unnecessary as he could easily have them plotted on his own large scale map which he has with him at Dhofar. 6. If the Sultan were present in Muscat I think I could persuade him to agree in writirjg to the boundary line mention in paragraph 5 above but I am afraid that until His Highness returns from Dhofar nothing further can be done in the matter for the present. Letters from Dhofar for the next three months can be received by dhows but not despatched except byYour Highziftss, With reference to our conversation on the subject quoted above I an writing formally to state that X have been instructed by His Majesty's Government to inform Your Highness that they are endeavouring to negotiate a treaty with His Majesty I bn daud which would determine amongst other matters the Muscat baud! frontier. 2 . The negotiations cover the whole question of the south and eastern frontiers of baud! Arabia and are pert of wider negotiations which f it is hoped f will consolidate the cordial relations existing between His Majesty's Government and Ibn baud but as parts of the frontier to be negotiated are of interest to Muscat His Majesty's Government desire to inform Your Highness of the present position. G. Ibn baud has made claims in south east Arabia to a wide area the whole of which His Majesty's Government are not prepared to recognise. They,however Y see no objection to recog* nlslng Ibn baud's claim to an area in the Great bands extending Eastwards as far as Meridian 66° mast between parallels 22° and 20 ° and bouth to a line drawn from the latter point to the intersection of Meridian 52° and parallel 12° • 4.

HIS Majesty’s Minister at Jedda presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit to him the record of a conversation with Sheikh Yusuf l^asin on the 23rd April, 1936. Jedda, Ayril 23, 1936. Enclosure. Anglo-Saudi Negotiations: Eastern and South-Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia. I HAVE recorded separately the portion of my first formal conversation with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin yesterday, in which we resumed the discussion of the proposed prolongation of the Treaty of Jedda and connected questions. I have explained in that record that I did not wish Sheikh Yusuf to think that I was confining my attention to that subject because I had taken it first; and that 1 therefore purposely went on to the question of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers. 2. I reminded Sheikh Yusuf that, when discussing the frontier question with me at Riyadh, Fuad Bey had invoked an agreement between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Qatar prior to the Anglo-Qatar Treaty of 1916 and had held that, whatever the position might be now, the sheikh was then a free international agent. He had said that by the alleged agreement Ibn Saud had recognised the sheikh’s right to the Jebel Dukhan and the Araiq, but that the Jebel Naksh had been left to Ibn Saud. Fuad Bey’s contention as to the sheikh’s position before 1916 raised a very difficult legal issue, but my Government, as practical people, wished in the first instance to be informed on the simple question of fact. The Sheikh of Qatar had no recollection of any such agreement. His Majesty’s Government would like particulars of it and a copy. I had put this to Fuad Bey on the 16th March. He had not reverted to the subject. This astonished me. Surely, if the agreement existed, it could be produced at short notice. We had given all our agreements with the Persian Gulf rulers to the Saudi Government and were justified in expecting the information for which I had asked. 3. Sheikh Yusuf was most evasive. It became clear in the ensuing conver sation that he knew very little about what Fuad Bey had said and equally little about the whole business. He suggested at an early stage that the King might have “ allowed ” the sheikh to have certain places. I retorted sharply that I took exception to language of this sort, used as though it rested with Ibn Saud to determine the sheikh’s rights. The sheikh was an independent ruler, who had confided the charge of his foreign affairs to His Majesty’s Government. He was not Ibn Sand’s vassal. 4. At a later stage Sheikh Y r usuf tried to make out that the authority of the Sheikh of Qatar did not extend beyond what he called the Safhat-al-Qatar. This expression being new to me, I asked whether the Safhat included the Jebel Dukhan and the Araiq. Sheikh Yusuf replied in the negative, and tried to make out that Ibn Saud exercised authority in those two areas. I expressed amazement. Fuad Bey had said that the King had ceded those two areas over twenty years ago. Sheikh Yusuf now accused the King of having hung on to them ever since. [706 t—21 /2 t L l 5. Sheikh Yusuf invited me to ask the Sheikh of Qatar whether it was not a fact that Ibn Saud held the areas in question. I said that I should not like to ask the sheikh to bring such an accusation, which I was sorry to hear from the lips of Sheikh Yusuf. As regards the main issue, the sheikh had already been questioned. He held in principle that his rights extended to Salwa, but he was not now claiming that place, as Ibn Saud had taken it. He claimed mp^- emphatically the Jebel Dukhan and the Jebel Naksh, as being in relation to v and the Jebel Dukhan “ as the nose is to the face.” 6. Under further pressure to produce the alleged agreement, Sheikh Yusuf suggested that Fuad Bey would have to be asked about it. I scouted this. luad Bey had invoked an agreement, and I presumed it was either in the archives of the King’s diwan or those of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 7. After some more wrangling, Sheikh Yusuf asked whether the frontier question was to be settled on the basis of Saudi proposals or our proposals, or on what basis. I recited with what patience I could the main stages during the past year. Fuad Bey had informed me of the Saudi desiderata on the 3rd April, 1935. The subject had been discussed in London in June-July. I had taken new proposals to Riyadh. These had been rejected One of the Saudi objections to them was that our proposed boundary ran south of the Jebel Naksh, and Fuad Bey had invoked the agreement for which I was asking. The negotiations must proceed on the same basis as that on which I was about to leave Sheikh Yusuf : one foot before the other, step by step, and not by a flying leap from one end of the room to the other. 8. I was deliberately provocative in this conversation, which I have described only in its main outlines. I irritated Sheikh Yusuf all the more as it was very late and he was longing to get rid of me. He is notoriously most difficult m negotiation and it is desirable sometimes to go for him hot and strong. He irritated me too, so that the conversation, though most friendly in form, was acid at times and sub-acid throughout. My objects were threefold, viz. : (a) that stated in the first paragraph above; (b) to keep it well before Sheikh Yusuf, without making it a main point, that we controlled the foreign relations of Qatar; and (c) to press him as hard as possible about the alleged pre-1916 agreement.

British Legation, 1st June, 1936. Jedda. Sir, With reference to my telegram No, 74 of May 31st, I have the honour to enclose herewith records of my conversations with Sheykh Yusuf Yasin on May 27th and 30th about the question of the Eastern and South Eastern boundaries of Saudi Arabia. I regret the length of these, and I fear other, accounts of my recent conversations with Sheykh Yusuf. The lack of any real continuity between discussions with him and the earlier discussions with Fuad Bey Hamza makes it important that the records should be as full as possible for future reference, especially as I myself shall so soon cease to be concerned in the negotiation of the questions 2 , as I stated in my telegram under reference the most salient feature of the conversations was Sheykh Yusuf s refusal, under obviously stringent instructions from the King, to follow up Fuad Bey’s statement to me at Riyadh regarding an alleged agreement between the King and the Sheykh of Qatar antecedent to the Anglo-Qatar Treaty of 1916. The method employed was somewhat brutal, as the King might have got out of the difficulty in other ways, without letting Fuad Bey down quite so heavily. As a matter of fact, I suspect that Ibn Baud's orders to the Ikhwan not to at issue. enter/ The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C* &gt; M.P etc. , etc., etc.enter the Jebel Dukhan and the Araiq must hove followed on correspondence between Ibn Jiluwi and the Sheykh of Qatar, even though there may have been no agreement. In any case, I consider that it would be a mistake to take any further motice of the incident for two reasons. Fuad Bey will probably be again concerned in the further discussion of the general question and, as he is on the whole better to deal with than Sheykh Yusuf, it would be a pity to do anything on our side to compromise his position with Ibn Saud. Secondly, any clarification of the true position in the past regarding the Jebel Dukhan would have little value, as it would leave intact the question whether the Jebel Naksh is or is not to be regarded as part of the Jebel Dukhan. 3. You will observe that, when explaining to Sheykh Yusuf what had passed in Riyadh, I made no reference to Fuad Bey's strong hint in our private conversation on November 28th that, if His Majesty’s Government gave up the Jebel Naksh, the Saudi Government would give up the Khor al Odeid. I thought it more politic at this stage not to mention Fuad Bey’s suggestion (for the hint amounted to such a suggestion) bf a bargain on these lines. It would in my opinion be preferable, if there is any question of further concessions to Ibn Saud, to reserve this subject; and to reserve it, if possible, until Fuad Bey is again a party to the discussions. 4. It appeared to me, however, important, without particularising too much, to drive Sheykh Yusuf from the position that during the Riyadh conversations the King had insisted on the w'hole of his desiderata of April 3rd 1935 and had produced a reasonable defence of them. The point is of little importance, if His Majesty's Government are still unprepared to make any advance on the proposals which I took to Riyadh. If on the other hand they should decide in due course to offer more for the sake of a settlement, it would be of edvantage to be able to argue that Ibn Saud had on his side weakened on his original desiderata. 5 ./5. In again insisting on the objections of His Majesty’s Government to the letter addressed by Ibn Saud to the Sheykh of Qatar last August, I was animated by the same motive as that which inspired my language to Fuad Bey at Riyadh, as recorded in paragraph 4 of my despatch No.351 of December 10th. A settlement of the main controversy is as little in sight now as it was then and it is therefore as important as ever to keep well before Ibn Baud’s mind the danger he would run, if he tried to interfere with the operations of the holders of the oil concession for Qatar. I thought of showing Sheykh Yusuf on May 30th an extract from the King’s letter to the Sheykh of Qatar, in which he appeared to be using a threat of direct action, if his wishes were not met, but I decided not to follow up at this stage what I had said at the earlier meeting. 6. On a point of detail, I think it may be assumed that the first visit by Muhammad Ibn Nasir to the Sheykh of Qatar, which Sheykh Yusuf mentioned, was that described in paragraph 6 of the Report by Col. Loch enclosed in the Political Resident’s despatch to the India Office No.63-S of February 1st last. My impression is that the same man was the bearer of the King’s letter of August 6th 1935 and that the second visit referred to by Sheykh Yusuf was made in order to deliver the letter, but I am not very clear on this point. You will see that Sheykh Yusuf spoke as though Ibn Nasir’s second visit and the despatch of the letter had been independent proceedings but he could not indicate the order in which they had taken place and he may easily have been mistaken. 7 . i am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to the Government of India, Bushire, Bahrain and Aden. I have, etc. (Signed) Andrew Ryan.Anglo-Saudi Negoti? tions. Eastern &amp; South Eastern Frontier of Saudi Arabia . I had a further conversation with Sheykh Yusuf Yasin on this subject yesterday, the first since April 22nd. Mr. Judd and Ismail Effendi were present. Sheykh Yusuf was alone. 2. The conversation was, as usual, lengthy and at times discursive„ This record gives in a conneeted form all the essentials of what passed. It was clear throughout that Sheykh Yusuf’s language was very directly inspired by the King. 3. i began with a resum e of the position and reminded Sheykh Yusuf that my present instructions were limited to the one point of obtaining information regarding the agreement which, according to Fuad Bey’s statement to me at Riyadh, had been concluded between Ibn Saud and the Shoykh of Qatar before the date of the Anglo-Qatar Treaty of 1916. I had contested Fuad Bey’s view that the Sheykh of Qatar was necessarily a free international agent at that period. This raised a very difficult legal question and my Government had decided in the first instance to request information regarding the facts connected with the agreement, after seeking in vain for any trace of it in their own archives and ascertaining that the Sheykh denied any recollection of such an agreement. 4 # Sheykh Yusuf said that he had consulted the King and had a statement to make. They did not wish to touch on my conversation with Fuad Bey, with whom I or any other British representative could follow up what he had said on his return. The King, Sheykh Yusuf went on, had not in the past recognised any specific limits to the territories of the Persian Gulf rulers, though he always treated/treated thea in a liberal spirit. When the Ikhwan system was being organised he had directed the Ikhwan not to gQ into Dukhan or the Araiq, in order that they should not incommode Ibn Thani. (The use of this name, practically every time he mentioned the Sheykh of Qatar, was one of the minor indications of the fidelity with which Sheykh Yusuf was echoing the King). After the latter had granted the oil concession, the King had sent him a message by Muhammad Ibn Nasir, whom Sheykh Yusuf described as an Ikhwan Sheykh, of Bahrain origin, end who he thought bC're the same surname, A1 Khalifa, as the Sheykh of Bahrain. He had warned Ibn Thani not to allow the concessionaires to start work until the question of the frontier had been settled. He had said that there was no objection to his disclosing this message to His Majesty’s Government. 5. I reminded Sheykh Yusuf that the King had addressed a letter in much the same sense to the Sheykh of Qatar and that it had contained a threat of direct action, if the Sheykh did not comply with the King’s demand that no operations toy the concessionaires should be allowed until the frontier had been settled direct between himself and the Sheykh c&gt;r through the intermediary of His Majesty’s Government. We had taken and still took strong exception to that letter having been sent and to its contents. 6. Sheykh Yusuf said he remembered the correspondence to which I referred. (He was unable to say, when I put the question later, whether Ibn Nasir’s visit to the Sheykh had taken place before or after the sending of the King’s letter). 7. I said that if the threat contained in the King’s letter were carried out, His Majesty’s Government would be bound to protect what we believed to be the territory of the Sheykh of Qatar.8 Sheykh Yusuf eald that the position was well understood. The Saudi Government had reserved their position and His Majesty*s Government had reserved theirs. I observed that on my side I had done more than reserve a position. I had intimated the aonsequences which would ensue in the event of any Saudi intervention in what we considered the territory of the Sheykh of Qatar. We of course made reservations but I must emphasise what I had said in addition regarding the results of any attempt to give effect to the King's threat, having regard to the promise of protection which His Majesty’s Government had given to the Sheykh of Qatar. I reiterated my statement, adding that I was conscious of its seriousness. This, however, was a side issue to our present subject, that of the frontier. I agreed that Sheykh Yusuf should continue his main statement. 9, sheykh Yusuf expressed the doubt as to whether the King had used any threat. Speaking fromnBmcry, I said that the language used in one part of his letter seemed to foreshadow direct action if the sheykh did not comply with his wishes. This language was not categorical but it had conveyed that meaning to the Sheykh and others. I would look up the text and I should be delighted if I found that Sheykh Yusuf was right and all the rest of us wrong. 10. Sheykh Yusuf said that before the oil concession was granted the King had sent an earlier message to Ibn Thani by the same Ibn Nasir. He had said that he had no objection to leaving to Ibn Thani any territory which he could give up without detriment to his own interests, although he did not recognise that the territory in question belonged to any one but himself. His attitude was inspired by friendship for the Sheykh. He had added that the matter required to be dealt with by a special method, as it was the subject of friendly discussion with His Majesty’s/Majesty^ Government. 11. some further conversation ensued about these direct communications to the Sheykh of Qatar. It added nothing material to what had already been said, except that I stressed one point. The Saudi Government might think, contrary to our view, that they were free to address the Sheykh of Qatar direct. It was clear, however, that, if the Sheykh received communications from them, he was not merely free, but under an obligation, to inform His Majesty’s Government of them. I must make this clear, as Sheykh Yusuf had spoken of an intimation by the King to the Sheykh that he might communicate the terms of his second message by Ibn Nasir to His Majesty’s Government; implying that he could send other messages under condition of their not being so communicated. 12, Sheykh Yusuf proposed that we should revert to the discussion of the frontier question, without further reference to (a) Fuad Bey’s statements to me or (b) the question of direct communications. I said that I was quite willing not to pursue (b) but that I could not let (a) go at that. • Fuad Bey had been in Riyadh as Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs. He had received His Majesty's Government's new proposals on behalf of the King on November 25th and had rejected them on behalf of the King next day. I had conceived him to be still speaking as Deputy Minister for Foreign Affair* in our further discussion and I could only suppose that when he invoked a pre-1916 agreement between the King and the Sheykh of Qatar he was still speaking for the King. I was now told that we could pursue the matter with Fuad Bey on his return. This was an extraordinary position to take up and I could only draw my own conclusions from it. These were (i) that the King disavowed Fuad Bey and (ii) that the King did not endorse Fuad Bey’s statement/p St ag a re; woi He dii th£ Goa His Pus cla the In con 1 tha as imp con sub off &lt; rea&lt; the the a It Sauc His 11 Bey’ alt* Cone a lie istatement regarding the existence of the alleged pre-1916 agreement. courKe of further conversation, perhaps a little involved hut clear as to its tenor, Sheykh Yusuf repeated, a little uncomfortably,his statement that he would not touch on what had passed between me and Fuad Bey. He renewed his suggestion that we should get on with the discussion of the frontier question. I took the line that there was nothing we could discuss. The Saudi Government had stated their claims on April 3rd, 1935. His Majesty’s Government had, after much discussion with Fuad Bey and careful examination of the Saudi Government’s claims, propounded a new solution on November 25th, taking the fullest accouit possible of the King’s desiderata. In doing so, they were not stating claims but offering concessions. The King had rejected their offer. 14 • this part of the discussion I made it clear that His Majesty’s Government’s offer was one on which, as I had said in Riyadh, they did not expect to be able to improve, except that I had foreshadowed a possible further concession towards the east of the middle part of the line, subject to the consent of the Sultan of Muscat, if their offer were otherwise accepted. I adverted to Fuad Bey’s reactions, which were, generally, strong insistence on the Jebel Naksh; insistence, though not quite so strong, on the Khor al Odeid; and a suggestion that in the south a line might be drawn somewhere between that proposed by the Saudi Government on April 3rd 1935 and that proposed by His Majesty’s Government on November 25th. was clear, I said, from this reaction of Fuad Bey’s that the Jebel Nakhsh was the most difficult problem, although only one of various difficult problems. Consequently, when His Majesty’s Government heard of the alleged pre-1916 agreement by which, according to Fuad Bey, the/the King had left the Jebel Dukhan but not the Jebel Nakhsh to Qatar, His Majesty's Government had decided to go » into.this firet* They had searched their archives* They had sent Col. Loch specially to Qatar to question the Sheykh. In view of the negative results thus obtained, I had asked Fuad Bey on March 16th for information regarding the agreement. Having received no reply, I had renewed my request very • pressingly to Sheykh Yusuf on April 22nd. Many more weeks had passed and I was now left to draw the conclusions I had stated. All this had taken six months and we were now back at the position on November 26th* I would inform Hie Majesty’s Government by telegr ph of the result of my action on their instructions, which, I repeated, were confined to elucidating the facts concerning the alleged agreement. I added that they would in my opinion be so amazed that they would take some little time to consider the next step. 16. Sheykh Yusuf said that, as I had stated my views, he would like to state his. I agreed but asked whether the views would be his own or those of his Government. Sheykh Yusuf said they would be the views of his Government* I observed that I was quite ready to listen to either personal or official views. The importance of what I had said about Fuad Bey's statement to me about the alleged agreement was that he was not at that point expressing views but making a statement of fact. 17. As it was now late, we agreed that Sheykh Yusuf should reserve his statement for a further meeting on May 30th. 18 This conversation, unlike that of April 22nd was amicable throughout. To give Sheykh Yusuf his due he used great restraint and I did likewise as far as possible. ANDREW RYAN. 28th May, 1936Anglo-Saudi Fropt:* atione . Eastern and South eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. Sheykh Yusuf Yasin called on me this morning. Ismail Effendi, my interpreter, was the only other person present. The following is a somewhat condensed record of our conversation on this subject, which was again fairly long but consisted largely of explanations given by me to Sheykh Yusuf about what he ought to have known, viz. the nature of my conversations in Riyadh. 2* Before hearing Sheykh Yusuf's promised statement, I gsked has permission to make a short statement of my own arising out* of our last discussion on May 27th. I had, I said, looked up my records and found that Fuad Bey’s statement regarding the alleged agreement between the King and the Sheykh of Qatar was made on November 26th, when he had brought me the King’s refusal of His Majesty’s Government’s proposals, not, as I had thought, in a subsequent conversation, it was therefore made in the course of a highly official discussion. On the other hand, I wished to make one point clear in to Fuad Bey. I had used the word 'agreement” so constantly that it might be thought that Fuad Bey had spoken of something in the nature of a formal instrument like a treaty. He had indeed spoken of an agreement, but of one embodied in correspondence between Ibn Jiluwi and the Sheykh of Qatar. 3. Sheykh Yusuf said that he could add nothing to what he had said on May 27th but he noted what i had said and thanked me for it, saying that it was important. I emphasised my anxiety not to misrepresent Fuad Bey in any way. 4-/4 Sheykh Yusuf then made his counter statement @&gt; which was very short. He recalled the Saudi memorandum of April 3rd 1935 and the proposals made by me on November these as final but the King had insisted on his desiderata of April 3rd 1935 and had given reasons in support, i had undertaken to report what had passed to His Majesty's Government, The Saudi Government therefore expected a further statement of His Majesty’s Government’s views. insisted during the Riyadh conversations on his desiderata of April 3rd 1935 and that ho had given reasons in support of them. Both he and Fuad Bey had seemed to aim at some compromise between the Saudi desiderata of April 3rd 1935 and our proposals of November 25thc I had made it clear that His Majesty’s Government were unlikely to be able to offer more, except for the possibility of some further concession east of the line along Meridian 55 degrees East but I had naturally promised to report the King’s views. I had done so and my Government had devoted their attention in the first instance to the matter, which we had discussed at our last meeting (viz, the alleged Saudi-Qatar pre-1916 agreement), 6. I supported my statement that there had been no insistence on the Saudi desiderata as a whole in Riyadh by reviewing with s mie care, with the help of my record, the most important conversations there, that with the King on November 25th, that with Fuad Bey on the 26th and my further conversation with the King later that day. The King had not discussed details but I had understood him to favour a compromise between his desiderata and our proposals. Fuad Bey had insisted on the Jebel Naksh and given reasons why it should be left to Saudi Arabia, besides adducing the alleged agreement which Sheykh Yusuf and I 25th on behalf of His Majesty's Government. I had described 5. I demurred to the suggestion that the King had had/had discussed. He had also pressed for the Khor el Odeid and in this case also had given reasons of a different kind. As regards the line further south, he had clearly contemplated a compromise. On my side I had rejected the claim to the Khor el Odeid. Indeed I had had no authority to foreshadow any inprovement on His Majesty’s Government’s offer anywhere. I had held out a possible hope of some concession east of Meridian 55 degrees, subject to the consent of the Sultan of Muscat, not under instructions to make an offer but as a deduction from the correspondence; and Fuad Bey had seized on this to suggest that a line in that area running along Meridian 56 degrees might form part of a boundary intermediate between that which the King had claimed and that proposed by us. The only other important point Fuad Bey had made had been in connexion with the important to the Saudi Government of not prejudicing the position of the King of the Yemen. (This seemed to puzzle Sheykh Yusuf). 7. I explained that I h d had one further conversation with Fuad Bey on November 28th. This however was private and I was not relying on it. I need only say that it confirmed me in my belief that the Saudi Government were seeking a compromise. 6. I then showed Sheykh Yusuf a duplicate of the map which I had given to Fuad Bey in Riyadh and explained on it more particularly what I had said about the line along Meridian 55 degrees and what Fuad Bey had meant by his reference to the King of the Yemen. 9. Sheykh Yusuf thanked me for my explanations. He promised to study the subject further in the light of them and to speak to me again later. He admitted that his Government, while adhering to their desiderata of April 3rd 1935,had contemplated the possibility of a compromise. 10. I said that I had postponed reporting our conversation/conversation of May 27th until we could complete it, I would now do so. I feared, i said, that the question would go on for a long time, I commended the wisdom of a remark by the King in Riyadh that it did not matter if officials took a couple of years to settle a matter; provided, I added, that friendship remained intact. Sheykh Yusuf echoed the sentiment implied in this addition.

British Legation, Jedda. 2nd June, 1936. Sir Andrew Ryan 1 s conversation with Sheykh Yusuf Yasin on 2nd June, 1936 regarding the Eastern and South Eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia.

Name and Date Subject Copies sent to India, Aden, Bushire and Bahrain.Anglo-Saudi Negotiations* Eastern &amp; South Eastern. Frontiers of Saudi Arabia . Sheykh Yusuf Yasin reverted to this subject, when I visited him this morning. Ismail Effendi and Asad Bey al Facih were present. The conversation on this occasion need not he recorded at any length, so little did it really add to what had passed before. It was entirely amicable. 2. Sheykh Yusuf's object seemed to be to define the position as being that the King, while adhering in principle to his desiderata of 3rd April, 1935, had favoured a compromise between them and our proposals, when I was in Riyadh, and that the Saudi Government had since been expecting the reaction of His Majesty's Government to this suggestion. 3. On my side I took the line that the King seemed to lose sight of the fact that the proposals I had taken to Riyadh were themselves an attempt at a compromise between two extreme views. We might also go back in principle to our original view but we had in fact gone half way to meet the King after study of all the data. After the Riyadh conversations the Saudi Government were certainly entitled to expect a reaction from His Majesty's Government, but Sheykh Yusuf's suggestion that this expectation had not been fulfilled convened me to revert to a subject, which he had been unwilling to pursue in our last two conversations. His Majesty* Government had investigated Fuad Bey's statement about the alleged pre-1916 agreement and, in view of the negative results obtained, had asked for further information. The Saudi Government had taken about two and a half months to reply and the reply had been a disavowal of Fuad Bey. They were now again/ZKj again entitled to expeot a reaction from His Majesty's Government. I had taken steps to obtain it but it would take time as His Majesty's Government could not take a decision without awaiting my full report. 4. After some further discussion on these points, which added nothing material, I mentioned that I had looked up my information about Ibn Nasir's first visit to the Sheykh of Qatar. Its effect was that the King had asked the Sheykh to give up Mashabiyah; that the Sheykh had refused; and that the King had subsequently sent a telegram, in which he recorded the Sheykh's attitude. Sheykh Yusuf knew my views about these direct exchanges and I did not wish to return to this subject. My point was that, if such exchanges had any value, the Sheykh had on this particular occasion affirmed his rights in the area adjoining the southern end of Dohat al Salwa. 5. Sheykh Yusuf, turning to the more general aspects of the whole question, said something about the Amirs taking their line from the King in various matters like Zakat etc. X was not clear as to what he was saying, as Ismail Effendi, who had been translating, was seriously indisposed. Sheykh Yusuf was certainly speaking about the Persian Gulf rulers until he realised that he had dropped a brick. He then used Asad Bey, at my request, to interpret and modified his language considerably. He was speaking, he said, of the tribes, with whom the King s influence was great and who respected his authority in regard to such matters as Zakat and acts of aggression, which he alone could restrain. He explained rather anxiously that in any case he was now only speaking personally and did not wish to follow the subject up. I accepted this but reminded him that Fuad Bey had, when invoking tribal considerations/considerations, limited the Saudi claims to three tribes and part of a fourth, I added that His Majesty*s Government, v/hile unable to regard tribal Diras as such a basis of a territorial settlement, had taken great account of the tribal considerations in framing their proposals, especially as regards the Murra, whom we admitted to be in the main subject to the King's authority, though it was not very long since it had been established. I embroidered somewhat on this theme, but, in view of the nature of this part of the conversation, no further record of what v/as said on either side is necessary.

I expressed surprise and drew obvious conclusion that the King was now disavowing Fuad's statement, considersuion of which had taken six months. 5. Reference by Yusuf Yasin to messages sent by the King to the Sheikh during the past two years gave me an opportunity of re-stating strongly our attitude towards such messages and more particularly the King’s letter to the Sheikh of August 6th last. 4. as regards main question Yusuf Yasin took the line that the King had met our proposals of last November by insisting on his own desiderata of .April 3rd, 1935, and that it was therefore lor His Majesty's Government to make further statement of views. I demonstrated that during the Riyadh conversations the King and Fuad had not insisted on their original desiderata as a whole but appeared to be working lor a compromise between them and His Majesty's Government’s proposals.

The revolt continued during the was, assisted by Turkish propaganda and culminated in a serious attack on Muscat in 1915, by a large force of Omanis, This force which advanced within about 6 miles of the t vwn, w^s driven back by British troops, which were thenstationed at Muscat, 5, In spite of the fact that the Sultan’s control over the Omanis was nominal, he made various abortive attempts to establish his rule over the interior. In 1920, under the guidance of the Political Agent, negotiations were opened f or s tabl izing the situationas between the Sultan and the Omanis. The Imam proving obdurate, the Sultan imp os &lt; a penal tax of 25^ on dates coming down from the interioi This cuased much discont nd in Oman, chiefly directed against the Imam who, still refusing to come to terms with the Sultan, was murdered by his av n subjects. The Sultan, sir Tamar bin Faisal, fatiwrof the present Rule- t „ nuj.er, t hen managed toto secure the election of his father-in-law, Mohamed bin Abdullah al Khalill as Imam. After further negotiations, ae treaty was signed in 1920, which left the Imam supreme in the interiro of ffiman, but stipulated that the Omanis should pay certain dues on their goods entering and leaving the Muscat ports. The treaty is recognised by the Government of India as a most satisfactory solution of the relations between tne Sultan and the Omanis, but - an important point - we are not responsible for its enforcement on either rty* Since the signature of the treaty there has been peace between the Sultan and the Omanis. 6. The predominant personality in Oman until recently was Shaikh Isa bin a a llh al Harlthi . who had been, as the leader of the Hinawi confederation, one of the Imam's principal support ers in the rebellion. But his influence is now declining before that of his son Shaikh Mohammed bin laa al Harithi . 11 was, incidentally, Shaikh Isa who signed the 1920 treaty with the Sultan on behalf of the Imam. 7. The present position as between the Sultan and the Omanis is that though the former still calls himself Sultan of Muscat and Oman, tlie latter to all intents and purposes are independent. At the same time, if they should flagrantly break the treaty or otherwise show hostility towards him, he has the whip^hand of them as the ports, from which they get their goods, are in his hands. 8. As regards a possible rapprochement between Ibn Saud and the Omanis; this might arise if the Sultan at ary time made a threat on their independence, of which, like all mountaineers, they are extremely jealous. The Ibadhi sect to which the Omanis belong has certain affinities with Wahabism. Indeed, some of the Ghafiri tribes, notably the Beni Bu Ali near Sur, are Wahabis. At the same time the Omanis would, possibly, be astute enough to realise that tc put themselves ur.ier Ibn Seud would be to jump from the frying /r* -3- frying pan into tile fire* 9. Ab to your question (b) f on tne range oftne intluence of the Ibadhi leaders; it is* of course, impossible to lay ctown its limits more precisely than by saying that roughly speaking the Omanis control the htrterland and the Sultan the coastal pie in.

AHDRKW RYAS.No. 107/380/8 17th January 1936 (My dear Fowl®), You will remember that when I was discussing the eastern and south-eastern frontier question with Fuad Hamza at Riyadh he suggested that the Sultan of Muscat and Oman would agree to any frontier we might propose between his territories and Saudi Arabia, because he had so much trouble with two personages in the interior viz. A1 Khalili and A1 Kharusi. The implication was that it would pay the Sultan to have a definite frontier, within which his authority would be internationally reco nised. hinterland of Muscat towards Saudi Arabia of quasi- independent authorities might become important, if they were people with wnom ion deua coaj.a nope ior oome unaerB t , a possibility which would depend on various factors, including their religious outlook. I have never, however, been able to get a clear idea of who and what they are, although one sees occasional references, e.g. in Muscat Intelligence greater than that of the Sultan of Muscat. The old Handbook of Arabia Volume I pp. 347-248 gives some account of an Ibadhi religious teacher named Abdullah Ibn Humaid As-Salimi, an Ibadhi religious teacher and his son-in-law Salim Ibn Rashid Al-Kharusi, whom the former had sent up as Imam of Tanuf. I have long thought that the presence in the Report No. 16 of 1934, to an Imam, whose authority seems to be On/ Lt. Col. T.O.w. Powle, C.B.K BushireOn the other hand de Gaury gave me last May the name of the Imam in the Oman hinterland as Muhammad Ihn Abdullah al Khalili. He had got this name not long before from that Libyan Odyesseus, Suleyman Al-Baruni, who had I understand been for a time in the service of the said Imam* My impression is that Ibn Saud knows very little about these gentlemen but that he knows a bit more than he did two or three years ago, when luad asked me, I think in genuine ignorance, whether there was not some other ruler in the hinterland of Muscat. You probably have a good deal more information. I should be grateful for anything you could tell me as to (a) who the people are (b) the range of their present authority and (c) the likelihood of thefc* having or developing any connexion with Ibn Saud. He might like to nobble them, if their remoteness and religious tenets did not make it impossible, in the same way that he nobbled the people in Najran. I am sending copies of this to the Kastern Department of the Foreign Office and privately to de Gaury, who is interested in the matter and was one of the sources ox my present meagre information. Yours sincerely, (Signed) Andrew Ryan. P.S. After drafting this letter I discovered that the enquiry by Fuad, mentioned in the first sentence of paragraph 5 , is much more recent than I thought.

This force which advanced within about 6 miles of the town, was driven back by British troops, which were then stationed at Muscat. 5. In spite of the fact that the Sultan’s control over the Omanis was nominal, he made various abortive attempts to establish his rule over the interior. In 1920, under the guidance of the Political Agent, negotiations were opened for stablizing the situation as between the Sultan and the Omanis. The Imam proving obdurate, the Sultan imposed a penal tax of 25* on dates coming down from the interior. This caused much discontent in Oman, chiefly /directed/ 8 . directed against the Imam who# still refusing to come to terms with the Sultan, was murdered by his own subjects. The Sultan, Sir Taimur bin Faisal, father of the present Ruler, then managed to secure the election of his father- in-law, kohamed bln Abdullah al Khallll as Imam. After further negotiations, a treaty was signed in 1920, which left the Imam supreme in the interior of Oman, but stipulated that the Omanis should pay certain dues on their goods entering and leaving the kuscat ports. The treaty is recognised by the Government of India as a most satisfactory solution of the relations between the Sultan and the Omanis, but - an important point - we are not responsible for its enforcement on either party. Since the signature of the treaty there has been peace between the Sultan and the Omanis. 6. The predominant personality in Oman until recently was Shaikh Isa bln aallh al iiarithl , who had been, as the leader of the ilinawi confederation, one of the Imam’s principal supporters in the rebellion. But his influence is now declining before that of his son Shaikh ^oh.xmmed bln Isa al riarlthl . It was, incidentally, Shaikh Isa who signed the 1920 treaty with the Sultan on behalf of the Imam. 7. The present position as between the Sultan and the Omanis is that though the former still calls himself Sultan of Muscat and Oman, the latter to all intents and purposes are independent. At the same time, if they should flagrantly break the treaty or otherwise show hostility towards him, he has the whin-hand of them as the ports, from which they get their goods, are in his hands.8. As regards a possible rapprochement between Ibn Baud and the Omanis; this might arise if the Sultan at any tiM made a threat on their independence, of which, like all mountaineers, they are extremely jealous* The Ibadhi sect to which the Omanis belong has certain affinities with Wahabism. Indeed, some of the Ghafiri tribes, notably the Beni Bu Ali near Sur, are Wahabis. At the same time the Omani* would, possibly, be astute enough to realise that to put themselves under Ibn Saud would be to jump from the frying pan into the fire. 9. As to your question (b), on the range of the influence of the Ibadhi leaders; it is, of course, impossible to lay down its limits more precisely than by saying that roughly speaking the Omanis control the hinterland and the Sultan the coastal plain.

He evidently knew nothing about the alleged agreement and little if anything of Fuad’s statement to me in Riadh or its implications. I insisted that Fuad had expressly invoked agreement of material importance and that apart from legal aspects of Fuad’s arguments based on it His majesty’s Government were entitled to full information. 5.

Similar copies to India and Bushire.Conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza on March 16th 1936 regarding the Eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. I reverted to this subject in the conversation with Fuad Bey, the general nature of which I have recorded in a separate minute. I said that His Majesty’s Government were studying the reaction of the Saudi Government to the new proposals which I had communicated to the latter during my visit to Riyadh. It would be difficult, as I had then foreshadowed, to modify our proposals but the examination of the matter was proceeding. For the moment, I was instructed to take up one matter, that of the Jebel Nakhah which was one of the most crucial issues, though the others also presented difficulty. 2. I reminded Fuad Bey that he had expressed doubt at Riyadh as to whether the Anglo-Qatar Treaty of 1916 had been communicated to the Saudi Government. He had admitted that this was not of material importance but in any case there could be no doubt on the subject, as this particular treaty had been mentioned specifically in Mr. Jakins* note of December 4th 1927. The Treaty must in fact have accompanied the note, as, if it had been omitted in error, the fact would have been patent to the Saudi Government. 3. I went on to the more important question of the agreement said to have been concluded between Ibn Baud and the Sheykh of Qatar before the date of the Anglo-Qatar Treaty. Fuad Bey’s statement on this subject in Riyadh raised a question of law and a question of fact. His Majesty’s Government had instructed me to elucidate the question of fact, but, in making the enquiry I was directed to make, they were not prejudicing the question of law. Fuad Bey had asserted a legal6. legal theory, to which I had demurred. The question of law was difficult and required further study. 4. As regards the question of fact, His Majesty’s Government had many records previous to 1916. They had no record in their own archives of any such agreement as that invoked hy Fuad Bey at Riyadh. The Political Agent at Bahrain had therefore paid a special visit to the Sheykh of Qatar on January 20th. The Sheykh had affirmed most positively that he had no recollection of any agreement hy which he had given up the Jehel Nakhsh. I summed up the relevant passages in Col. Loch’s despatch to the Political Resident No. C/38-ia/38 of January 25th (see the Resident’s despatch to the India Office No. 63/S of February 1st 1936) about the Jebel Nakhsh being an integral part of the Jebel Dukhan structure (part of it 'as the nose is part of the face') and the position of the Araiq. I suggested that, as the King held that there was an agreement, we should be given particulars of it and might expect to be furnished with a copy. 5. Fuad Bey tried to side-track me by asking whether, if the agreement were produced, His Majesty’s Government would accept it as valid. I said that this was covered by what I had said about the question of law. He himself had expressed a view on this subject, which would not be prejudiced by the production of the agreement. We on our side were seeking necessary information and could not prejudice the legal position either. I added, but only as from myself, that I thought the particulars of the agreement might have an important bearing on its validity, e.g. the date, the status of Ibn Saud at the time and the capacity of Tbn Jiluwi, with whom the agreement was represented as having been concluded.6. Fuad Bey also tried to make out that we were not acting in the spirit of a friendly negotiation with a view to a practical settlement of the whole question of the frontier. I replied that, on the contrary, we were Being very practical indeed in trying to elucidate all material issues. He should take comfort from the fact that difficult as it was for His Majesty’s Government to modify what they had consiaered a handsome offer, they were going carefully into everything raised By the Saudi reaction to it. 7. Fuad Bey at last intimated that he might Be aBle to supply the information for which I had asked, But he gave no definite promise and his whole attitude was guarded to the point of evasiveness. 8. In the course of the conversation, I adverted to the messages reported By Col. Loch in his despatch quoted aBove to have Be^u exchanged Betveen the King and the Sheykh of Qatar, when the King had sent one Muhammad iBn Nasir to the Sheykh. I said that I preferred to regard these messages as a friendly exchange of views as they had passed suBsequently to the Anglo-Qatar Treaty of 1916 and the Treaty of Jedda, after the conclusion of which our treaties with various rulers had Been communicated to IBn Saud By special arrangement and for a definite purpose. I reminded Fuad Bey of the views I had expressed on previous occasions regarding our position in regard to the foreign relations of the rulers. Fuad Bey hinted at, rather than expressed, disagreement with those views, saying that he hoped nothing would happen to prevent the Saudi Government from corresponding with His Majesty's Government regarding the affairs of the rulers. We agreed that the moment was not opportune for pursuing this question, which was dealt with ratherrather lightly on 'both sides, although I had drawn attention to the Ibn Nasir message, with the express object of reaffirming, however incidentally, the views of His Majesty’s Government. It also gave me an opportunity of mentioning the Sheykh’s claim to Mashabiyya, which Fuad Bey said he had mentioned himself in the discussions in London. I showed him a very rough copy of the sketch attached to Col. Loch’s report, referred to above. As this must be sent home by the earliest possible bag, I have not been able to look up all the papers, but I do not find any mention of Mashabiyya in the records of the conversations in London last summer.

On the whole I IsJt itni/J fati* 4 would suggest that it—might- be b-eet-^a vmit for the report which we expect as the result of Watts' projected interview with the Sultan; if there were then any outstanding points of obscurity, we could perhaps try—and g-et Thomas te— elucidate them. yours sincerely, mM. C, WALTON.iNL/i~/v£JD (E 1659/152/91) My dear Y/alton, In connexion v/ith the enquiries which you are making of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf about the hinterland frontiers of Muscat in the neighbourhood of Meridians 5b and 56, you may he interested to hear that I recently got a letter from Bertram Thomas, saying that he might still he able to take on any attractive temporary job we felt inclined to offer him, and explaining that letters addressed to him at the Athenaeum will always he forwarded as he keeps them posted v/ith his address. 2. You may remember that last year Gilbert Laithwaite and I tried to get in touch with him with the idea that he might have been helpful in connexion with the south-eastern Arabian frontiers, but he tells me * J.C. Walton Esq. ,G.B. ,M.C.* me that he never received Laithwaite^ letter, and that it must have gone astray with others when following him about somewhere in China. 3. I am not sure whether the present authorities in the Gulf and Muscat would he at all inclined to welcome Bertram Thomas’s collaboration. On the other hand, he certainly knows more about the hinterland of Muscat, more especially in the neighbourhood of the intersection of Parallel 20 with Meridians 55 and 56, than anyone else; and, even if there were no question of making use of his services on the spot, it is perhaps worth considering whether we might not get useful further information from him about some of the wells and oases wnich have recently formed the subject of discussion. 4. Perhaps you would think over this suggestion, and let me know in due course whether you think it is worth pursuing?

'Tn~this A connection consideration was given to the question of what Sir Andrew Ryan should say in reply to a suggestion by Fuad that there was an agreement between the Sheikh of Qatar and Ibn Jiluwi (possibly before 1916), whereby the sheikh formally accepted Ibn Saud*s sovereignty over Jebel Naksh. The existence of any such agreement is categorically denied by the Sheikh, and the meeting agreed that as a first step Sir Andrew Ryan should at some convenient opportunity ask the Saudi Government for further information about this alleged agreement; saying that H.M.G. have been unable to trace anything of the kind and that in seeking for further information they do not necessarily admit that if the existence of an agreement were established they could recognise it as a valid instrument. sent by the Foreign Office in their telegram of 7th March flagged below (P.Z.1734/36). The meeting also discussed the position in regard \ ' to the Eastern and southern portions of the proposed 3939 5000 7/35 boundary/ * ^* // f &gt; 6 boundary. Here it was felt that,while there was at the moment no reason for departing from H.M.G.'s present attitude of standing fast on the present line as a final puff's offer, there would be every advantage in getting the A fullest possible information; particularly in getting the * position clear about the Sultan of Muscat*s own ideas of his frontier. It will be remembered that when instructions were being issued to Sir Andrew Ryan last November, the Sultan of Muscat was not being in Dhofar. His Highness is still there but it may be possible, even if he is not returning shortly, to get in touch with him. This further information can conveniently be obtained while Sir Andrew Ryan is carrying out his present instructions in regard to the alleged Jebel Naksh agreemert. A telegram (which seems quite suitable) has been drafted by the Colonial Office for issue to sir Bernard Reilly consulting him about the part of the line bordering on * the Hadramaut and Aden Protectorate. It is proposed to concur in this draft (though this is a matter really more for the Foreign Office than ourselves) and a^ draft telegram to the Government of India (repeated to the Political Resident) is now submitted. If approved, it will be put to the Foreign Office for concurrence.

The principal difficulties did not refer to the extreme eastern ■portion of the boundary but to the base of the i^atar peninsula, and the main obstacle to a settlement had 1936* to Jedda.

It might he said that time was on our side, and that it would he better to wait and see how matters developed and not to make any further effort to reach an early settlement. This was a preliminary point which the Sub-Coi.mittee might consider. He wished to say at once, however, that the Foreign Office saw serious objections to such a course. In the first place the longer the frontier question was left indeterminate the more likely Ibn Saud was to con tinue the process of penetration and infiltration which he had so successfully carried out in the past. If a settle ment were unduly delayed there would be nothing to prevent Ibn Saud extending his authority unofficially towards the coast in many directions. We were not in a position to prevent him from doing so, and if we waited too long we might easily find ourselves in some years’ time in a far worse position for reaching a satisfactory settlement than we were in at presents Secondly, the situation had been greatly complicated by recent oil developments. Petroleum Concessions Limited already held a concession in Qatar which they might want to operate, and there was reason to believe that their operations might begin in the south-western corner of their concession in territory which was still claimed by Ibn Saud. The Standard Oil Company of California held a concession, which it was operating, in Hasa. It might well be tempted to extend its operations eastwards into disputed territory, and a very awkward situation might at any moment arise. Again air developments might produce an incident so long as large stretches of territory were under indeterminate sovereignty.. The oil companies had their own aircraft,BBWBMmnMM - 5 - ♦ and civil flights down the Arab coast frequently tool: place. It night be nost embarrassing if in the case of a forced landing or an attack on an aeroplane the question of ultimate territorial responsibility should arise before a frontier settlement was reached. Lastly, continued failure to reach a settlement on this question was bound adversely to affect our political relations with Ibn Saud and to render a solution of other problems more difficult. The foreign Office felt strongly therefore that a further effort should bo made bo reach a settlement as soon as possible. Till] CKAIldLAIT suggested that in the first place the Committee should decide whether negotiations with the Saudi Government should be pursued or not. Hatters of detail could be discussed when this ooint had been decided. HR. Y7ALTC2T said the India Office were conscious of the desirability of a settlement and of consolidating our friendship with Ibn Saud. The Government of India and the political authorities in the Per:ian Gulf, who had had great experience in dealing with Orientals, would, ho thought, agree that the best tactics to employ were to state our terms categorically and, having done so, to adhere to them mid not to yield from one point to another. Concessions to Ibn Saud’c policy of 'squeeze' wore not likely to make him value our friendship. Sir Andrew Ryan’s instructions (para. 13 of foreign Office despatch ITo. 309, already referred to) were to make it clear that our last offer represented a final concession which His Majesty’s Government would not bo able to increase, and the India Office felt that it would be a mistake to continue negotiations by still further concessions, which method was not likely to succeed in bringing about a firm understanding.-4- m WV) }£R. REIIDUL said that there was a difference 'between the preliminary point of deciding whether to continue discussions at all, and the question whether further concessions should be offered. He had not meant to raise the question of further concessions. The question he had intended to raise was v/hethe.r instructions should be sent to Sir A, Ryan to resume discussions with the Saudi Government, or whether Sir A. Ryan should merely be told to play for time and leave the next step to the Saudis. He felt strongly that the first of these alternatives was preferable. As regards the question of further concessions he thought that there was general agreement that, except for a possible modification at the extreme eastern end of the boundary, no further concessions should be offered. HR. HALTOil pointed out that Sir Andrew Ryan in paragraph 7 of his despatch No, obi of 10th December, suggested that there were only two alternatives, either to offer further concessions or to accept a prolonged deadlock and that Sir Andrew Ryan considered that the latter might be no bad thing in all the circumstances. Mr. Walton agreed, however, that, ruling out further concessions, there v/ere still two possible alternatives - (l) to continue discussions in order, if possible, to argue the Saudis round to our point of view, or (2) to acquiesce in a deadlock. In reply to the Chairman he said that either course would be preferable to further concessions. He emphasised, however, the danger of further negotiations, in that the Saudi authorities would try to make our last offer a basis for further concessions. In any further discussions, we should have to be on our guard against this.A discussion then ensued on whether it waiLdbe expedient for His Majesty’s Government to initiate further negotiations or whether the initiative should be left to Ton Gaud. Methods of negotiation were discussed, and it was suggested that the next step might be either (1) To call on Ibn Saud to produce the alleged agreement with the Sheikh of Qatarj or possibly (2) To negotiate parts of the frontier piece meal rather than as a whole. The latter suggestion, however, was not considered to be desirable- As regards the situation which might arise should Jbn Saud be able to produce the agreement referred to, Mr. Hendel considered that his Majesty s Government might find themselves in an embarrassing position if a valid agreement were produced; but the position would be no worse than if the agreement did in fact exist and were not produced. There was every advantage, indeed, in knowing the true facts. The legal position appeared to be that before 1916 the Sheikh of Qatar was legally capable of alienating territory, and if he had alienated the Jebel Nakhsh before 1916 by a valid instrument, the alienation would already have been completed before His Majesty’s Government became formally responsible for the conduct of his foreign relations. Such an alienation would not be vitiated by any subsequent treaty. On the other hand it might be argued that the alleged agreement was invalid, either because Ibn Saud, having already accepted the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire,thereby became bound by the limitation imposed on the Ottoman territories by the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 - i. e. , that so long as he was a vassal of Turkey he was bound by the ‘'blue line.' This argument would have been stronger, however, had we definitely claimed the territory to the east of -F—the blue line either for ourselves or for the Sheikh of Qatar. Again it night be argued that the Sheikh of Qatar was under the general protection of His Majesty r s Governnent long before 1916, and had tacitly accepted that position by allowing His i.ajesty f s Government to negotiate the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914, which obviously closely concerned him. If this contention could be established the Sheikh would have had no right to alienate the Jebel Nakhsh to any other ruler v/ithout All these points could however, best be considered when we had received the Saudi reply to our request for further* e/iaence as to the alleged pre-1916 agreement between Ibn S^ud and the Sheikh of Qatar. The nature of the Saud.i reply on this point would obviously affect our whole handling of the question; and, as this was the most difficult portion of the frontier, he suggested that the issue of further general instructions to Sir A. Ryan should be postponed until this point had been cleared up, and that Sir A. Ryan should be instructed as a first step, merely to inform the Saudi Government that His majesty’s Government, after having made careful enquiries, could find no trace of the alleged agreement between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Qatar, and would therefore be grateful if the Saudi Government could produce further particulars regarding it. This was generally agreed to, but it was pointed out that the instructions ought to be so worded as not necessarily to commit His lajesty’s Government to acceptance of the validity of the agreement if it were found to exist. a saving clause was therefore devised to meet this point and will be found in the condasion. - 6 -~ 'v -’maMBBifct - 7 - The question of the modifications suggested by Fuad Bey^ referred to in paragraph 22 of Enclosure No* 2 to 3ir A. Ryan*s despatch^ which might affect the territories of Muscat and Oman* and the Aden Protectorate were then discussed;, and it was agreed that whilst oir A* Ryan was obtaining the necessary information regarding the alleged agreement 9 it would be desirable for the India Office and Colonial Office to approach the proper authorities and obtain their views on this question* Mr* Seal and Mr* 7aIton pointed out that these modifications seemed very extensive and questioned whether it would in any event be desirable thus to extend what we had told Ibn Baud v/as our final offer. But it was agreed that while there was at present no question of offering any further concession to Ibn Baud it was important for His Ilajesty’s Government to be as fully informed as possible as co the existence and extent :&gt;f any Muscat! and Hadramauti interests in this zone? as such infomation must be a factor in the consideration of the question. CONCLUSIONSs TEE SUB-COLB/IITTilb agreed;- (a) (i) That it was desirable on political grounds that an early settlement of this question should be reached if possible, provided this did not involve the offer of any further concession beyond that referred to in the final sentence of Foreign Office Telegram No. 102 of 18th November, 1905, to 3ir undrew Ryan| (ii) That in the first instance, and as the next step. Sir Andrew Ryan should be instructed to ask the Saudi Government for further information as to the agreement said to have been concluded before 1916 between Ibn 3aud and the Sheikh of Qatar, by w: ich the latter v/as stated to have accepted the former’s sovereignty over the Jebel Naksh.-8- / / TP 7 *!* urnmmmmmmmmm mmn* Sir Andrew Ryan should he instructed to malie it clear at the same time that His Majesty 7 s Government can trace no record of such an agreement 9 and that in asKing for further information regarding it they do not necessarily admit that 9 if its existence were established, they could recognise it as a valid instrument. (iii) That Sir Andrew Ryan should he informed that it is not proposed to furnish him with further instructions on the general question until the question of the alleged agreement, referred to above, has been cleared up. (b) That, in order that His Majesty's Government may be in possession of the fullest possible information when the time comes to issue final instructions to Sir Andrew Ryan, the Colonial Office should again consult the Resident at Aden as regards the southern sector of the line, making it c.fear however that, as matters are, jt is not proposed to offer any further con cession to Ibn Saud. In view however of Fuad Bey Hamza's suggestion (see Sir Andrew Ryan's despatch No. 351 of 10th December, 1935, enclosure No. 2, paragraph 22) that a line might be drawn to run somewhere between the line proposed by His Majesty's Government and that proposed in the Saudi memorandum of 3rd April, 1935, it would in particular be desirable to obtain Sir Bernard Reilly's view's on the question whether any Imperial or local interests would be adversely affected if the proposed line in this sector were carried somewhat further to the south. (c) That the India Office should similarly consult the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Government of India (a) as regards the possibility of taking the line further to the south between points G and H, and (b) as to the suggestion that the eastern sector of the line between points J and G should be taken up to Meridian 55 Bast, pointing out that although no further concession is at present contemplated His Majesty's Government desire to know whether any interest of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman w'ould be adversely affected if the line were taken further to the south or to the east in this area as suggested above.•TN (Notes Item No. 10 is additional to the Agenda which was circulated on the iSth February 9 1936.)-- A-'W'' h (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE S E C R E To MoBo( 0) 200c HE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA.JE STY’S GOVERNMENT) ^ COPY NO COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE STANDING CT?1?TCT AT.

I explained general character of new proposal to Fuad on Novemher 24-th. Cn Novemher 25th I gave him note of them with an illustrative map. Before he could study them I explained to the King personally the basis of the nrcoosals and urged them most strongly on his acceptance. On November 26th Fuad replied on behalf of the King. He described proposal as unacceptable and was specially insistent on inclusion of Jebel Naksh in Saudi Arabia. He reasserted claim to Khor Al Odeid also but less confidently. I was adamant about both but niated line and line which they had claimed on April 3rd in this area. 3 a I renewed to King personally that afternoon appeal to accept proposal of His Majesty’s Government but without success. 4. Fuad’s most important new point regarding Qatar boundary was that we were asking for more for oheykh than he himself had claimed in the past. Fuad maintained that Sheykh had at one time begged Ibn Saud more as a favour than as a right to leave him undisturbed in Teoel Dukhan and Araiq. The King had accepted this at the time and no longer wished to press claim to Araiq which had been made in memorandum of April 3rd but he would not give up Jebel Naksh. Fuad asserted that correspondence guardedly at possible extension of our offer east of line Jo to G. Fuad intimated readiness to consider inter mediate line between ours from G, to K. and on to Violet-4- ■ 'V '■ , ^ u on this subject he tween Sheyldi and I bn Jiluwi was prior to Anglo-Qatar treaty of 1916• He suggested that Sheykh was then a free agent and that agreement with Ibn &lt;T iluwi was therefore juridically binding. lie also urged that Jebel Naksh v/as necessary for defence of Calwa and that a frontier betv:een it and Jebel Dukhan would correspond with natural features 0 5. I resisted these arguments to the best of my ability. My impression v/as that Fuad’s instructions were to keen Jebel Naksh at all costs but that the King would abandon Khor A1 Cdeid in exchange. This was confirmed by non committal personal language of Fuad on 28th November. So I asserted(strongly) position of His Majesty’s (strong) Government in regard to coastal rulers generally and emphasised promise of protection which they had given to Sheyk of Qatar. 7 0 principal advance made so far is that the King no longer approaches matter with the bitterness which he displayed last year at Taif. He realises that he cannot secure all that he asked for in memorandum of April 3rd but he hopes to bargain for better terms than Eis Majesty’s Government have offered. I gave him and Fuad no encour agement to expect further concessions. I told the latter that in any case you were unlikely to decide anything pending receipt of detailed report. 8. Conversations covered wide range of other subjects to which I cannot do justice by telegraph. Full record will follow by next bag. Addressed to Foreign Office No.215; repeated to Government of India No.126 5 Bushire No.243.8261 [581 gg—3] B (3) THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). December 30. 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 3. [E 7574/77/91] Sir A. Ryan to Sir Samuel Hoare.—(Received December 30.) (No. 351.) Sir, Jed da, December 10. 1935. WITH reference to my telegram No. 215 of the 8th December, I have the honour to forward herewith copies of the note, based on your telegram No. 132 of the 18th November, by which I informed Fuad Bey on the 25th November of the proposals of His Majesty’s Government regarding the eastern and south eastern boundaries of Saudi Arabia, together with a record of my conversations on the subject in Riyadh and an annexed note by Captain de Gaury of what Fuad Bey told me about the Araiq area. I have thought it desirable to make the record of conversations as full as possible. 2. When I went to Riyadh I was in some doubt as to whether Ibn Saud was really keen on a settlement of the question or would prefer to maintain his claims of the 3rd April intact rather than agree to any compromise. The impression I got during the discussions was that the King, though out tor a bargain, and a hard one, was genuinely desirous of an agreement. It became moi e and more apparent to me as we went on that the most crucial issue, though by no means the only one, was the Jebel Nakhsh. 3. The form taken by the conversations in Riyadh made it difficult for me to adhere strictly to the'order of the arguments set forth in your despatch No. 309 of the 23rd October, but the record will show that I made full use of them all with the King or with luad Bey Hamza, or with both. 4. I had in mind throughout the first two sentences of paragraph 13 of the despatch just quoted regarding the finality of the new British offer. I was all the more anxious to emphasise the views of His Majesty s Government regarding their position vis-d-vis the Sheikh of Qatar and the other Peisian Gulf rulers, and more particularly to let the King understand that any active interference in the south of the Qatar Peninsula would involve him m a dangerous clash with His Majesty’s Government. The possibility of such interference is to my mind the chief disadvantage that might lesult fiom lea\ing the whole question unsettled, now that His Majesty s Government have made an offer handsome enough to deprive Ibn Saud of any reasonable ground for his former grievence that His Majesty’s Government were trving to den\ hi!» ancestral claims and to come the Turk over him. , . , T 5. You will notice that, although the King made a reference, which 1 preferred to ignore, to his relations with his Arab neighbours, luad Bey did not openly on this occasion contest my arguments as to the effect of our tieaties with the Persian Gulf rulers and article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda. In dealing with this subject I anticipated to a large extent the instructions in your despatch No 334 of the 19th November, which reached me on the 8th December, luad Bey has a far better legal brain than Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, and, instead of sustaining the Sheikh’s thesis, he developed a more ingenious argument of his own namely, that as the Anglo-Qatar Treaty was hot concluded until 1916, His Majesty s Government must respect an alleged earlier agreement, by which the khmkh of Qatar recognised Ibn Saud’s right to the Jebel Nakhsh. \ou will doubtless, instruct me as to how I should reinforce my extempore counter-argument., especially if enquiries on the Persian Gulf side disclose an\ reason for accepting Fuad Bey’s suggestion that the sheikh had before 1916 recognised Ibn Saud s right to the Jebel Nakhsh. , r ^ f 6 1 find that, owing to my lack of preparedness for luad Bey s argument, I overlooked one point, which I think had escaped him also namely, that a former Sheikh of Qatar entered into special relations with His Majesty s Government bv a formal agreement, dated the 12th September, 1868. you may think it possible to make use of this fact, even though the agreement of 1868 did not give His Majesty’s Government control of the foreign relations ot yatar.7. If His Majesty’s Government adhere strictly to the terms of the first two sentences of paragraph 13 of your despatch No. 309 of the ^3rd Octobei, there must, I think, he a prolonged deadlock. That may be no bad thing in all the circumstances. I cannot personally think, though I write with gieat deference to other views that it would really matter much if His Majesty s Government were to agree to a compromise in the southern area, but I am conscious of the great difficulty of giving up the Jebel Naksh. In this connexion it would be useful for me to have for my own use a sketch, showing the limits ot I the oil concession area and of the protection area in the south of Qatar. I was I shown a sketch of this kind in London, but my files here do not seem to contain i definite information regarding the two areas. 8. I would draw attention to two other matters which 1 did not consider it necessary to mention in my telegram under reference. The first is what Fuad Bey said, as set forth in paragraph 20 of the enclosed record, about the position vis-a-vis the Yemeni Government. I trust that you will approve of the general line which I took in regard to this unexpected subject. The othei mattei has to do with the proceedings of Colonel Pelly in and about 1805 (see paragraphs 12 and 13 of the record). This is only important as a matter of convincing Ibn Sand of the good faith of His Majesty’s Government. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department. Bushire, Bahrein and Aden. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure 1.

I ARRIVED in Riyadh late in the afternoon of the 23rd November. Ibn Sand received myself and my staff next morning, but the audience was one of courtesy only. That day, the 24th November, after luncheon, Fuad Bey expressed a wish to have a general talk about the business side of my visit. It had already been made pretty clear that the Saudis fully expected official matters to be discussed during my stay, and Fuad Bey started our conversation on the 24th November by asking me what I had in view. I explained that I had come equipped with instructions on various sub jects and that, as on previous occasions, I should welcome an opportunity of stating to the King in person the views of His Majesty’s Government, although His Majesty would probably wish me to discuss the details with his advisers. I reviewed the questions which had been discussed with Fuad Bey in London in July. I had new instructions regarding the question of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. This. I said, was the most important outstanding question. I would put second the question of Saudi-Koweit economic relations, and third that of the prolongation of the validity of the Treaty of Jedda, with the three connected questions of slavery, arms traffic and the language of the treaty. I had instructions on all these matters. I had instructions on the question of air facilities also, but I thought it might be better to leave that until after my return to Jedda. As for the Transjordan question, the position was that we were expecting a reply to the letter which Mr. Rendel had written to Fuad Bey on the 19th July. 2. This record deals only with the question of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers. In our conversation on the 24th November I explained to Fuad Bey the general nature of my new instructions. I emphasised the position of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Arab States on the Persian Gulf. Fuad Bey might, I said, dislike the pretensions of a non-Arab State to concern itself with Arabian affairs, but they were founded on an historic evolution. We could not contemplate a break in the line of States with which were in special relations. On the other hand, we were sincerely desirous of a settlement of the frontier question, and the new proposals I had brought took the fullest possible account of the desiderata which the Saudi Government had put forward. I stressed the fact that the new proposals were not merely an advance on the offers which His Majesty’s Government had previously made, but were based on a new method of approach to the question, that of readiness to meet Saudi views handsomely when we could do so, e.g., in regard to the country of the Murra tribe, the dira of which proved, in fact, to be much more extensive than we had supposed; but we must at the same time safeguard other essential interests. I pointed out that, in applying this new method, we had gone so far that further concessions could not be expected. I also said that they were subject to the assent of the Sultan of Muscat, whom we had wished to consult, but who was out of reach, when the matter had got to this stage. 3. Fuad Bey preserved the role of an attentive listener. He did not demur to my proposal to give general explanations to the King in person, but was clearly anxious to have our proposals as soon as possible. I thought it politic to promise to let him have on the 25th November a note of our proposals and to show him a map to illustrate their effect. 4. Fuad Bey called on the 25th November shortly before the time fixed for my audience with the King to present the insignia of the G.C.B. We had a short general conversation, which I need not record in detail. Its only interest lay in the fact that Fuad Bey got on to the old familiar theme that His Majesty's Government never considered Ibn Saud sufficiently, and had always returned evasive answers to his professions of friendship and a desire for close collabora tion with them. He spoke of the King’s grievances. I riposted, as usual, by saying how greatly His Majesty’s Government valued the King's friendship, but insisting that we had always believed the best way to consolidate mutual friend ship was to clear up outstanding questions. (I will revert to this part of the conversation when recording separately my conversations regarding the Koweit blockade.) Before we parted, I gave Fuad Bey my note of His Majesty’s Govern ment’s new proposals regarding the eastern and south-eastern frontiers and lent him a eopv of the latest edition of Hunter’s 1 in. = 32 miles Map of Arabia.showing the line now proposed and that which the uf the la^i— dSion'totFuIVCmaniM from Saudi territory.

I reminded the King of our conversations at Taif in July 19^ * then I said Fuad Bey had been twice in London ^ d ^ re h y discussion of outstanding questions. 1 indicated to the K g, e in done to Fuad Bey, the three subjects which I particularly wish P - T&gt;ivadh 4s regards the frontier question, I recalled the Saudi memmai of y the 3rd April and the counter-offer which I had then made. Fuad Bey had said^duringhife subsequent visit to London that the Saudi claims rested on a considered appreciation of tribal considerations, whereas the countei-offei lested on nothfng at all (Fuad Bey grinned). I could not accept this new of ou counter-offer, but I admitted that it was very limited. Aftei Fuad London His Majesty’s Government had studied vei\ taie u &gt; t [ ns he had supplied and had collected information from othei sources. All tnis information led up to the new proposals which I had given to Fua ^ , ey tefore the audience. I wished to indicate the bases on which they rested. They weie twofold.^ ^ hanc ) nis Majesty’s Government were responsible for the foreign affairs of Qatar and the Trucial Sheikhdoms. They had re s l»nsi u ities towards these States. They could not agree to deprive the She klicfQito'i o anv portion of the main block of that peninsula by ceding the Jebel Nakhsh 01 to 'isolate the sheikhdom by agreeing to a line drawn right across the base of the peninsula^ As regards'the I^ior-al-Odeid, they had consistently recognised that U belonged to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. I would not take the King through all the objections to the line his Government had proposed, but I wouW mention two other points His Majesty's Government were not in charge of the foreign affairs of the Sultan of Muscat, but he was bound to them by many ties and they must consider his interests very carefully. Their information legal ding the Hadhramaut tribes showed that their range extended a good deal further noith than the Saudi Government had supposed. 8 I had indicated, I said, the objections to the Saudi proposals of last \pril I now turned to our second basis, which was more favourable to the Saudi Government. We had gone deeply into the question of the distribution of tribes We did not think that an allocation of tribes as such could provide a frontier, having regard to the other historical, political and geographical factois, but we did think that great account should be taken of tribal considei atio s. We had done this in preparing our new proposal, and especially as vegai d s the Murra We had found that the dim of that tribe was, as Fuad Bey had told u , much more extensive than we had supposed. I would give two instances m which we had modified our views. We were relinquishing Banaiyan which we had at first honestly believed to lie m the domain of Abu Dhabi In the south we were willing to concede Shanna. Fuad Bey had given us a hst ol &gt; 1 thl ?[' g b j i ao we n s claimed for the Murra. We had not been able to identify them all, but I believed that, when the King studied our proposal, he would find most of them 11,1 'T'V initiated'to the King that the further we had gone to meet his views the more difficult it would be to increase our offer in any way. 1 ended b) commending it earnestly to his acceptance, saying that it would be \e &gt; unfortunate if, through failure to reach a settlement now we were thrown back on irreconciliable positions, we on our original legal theory, he on his clam. ° f ''To 3 ' The 1 King thanked me for my statement and expressed gratification at the general nature of our new proposals. He used language suggesting fairly clearly.[581 gg—3] B 3 J 'h \ jt 5 though not precisely, that we had now the basis of a settlement, for which he appeared to be eager. He said that he wished to make two points at the outset. He wished for the best relations with His Majesty’s Government. He also wished for the best relations with the neighbour States. He would not pursue the discussion further at this stage, but he wished to emphasise these two points. 11. I said that I quite understood the King’s inability to reply in detail on this occasion to a proposal which 1 had only just communicated to Fuad Bey. I took note with satisfaction of what he had said as regards his desire for good relations with His Majesty’s Government. 1 thought it politic to say nothing at this stage about his second point. As I had been with him by this time for about an hour and a half and it was time for the midday prayer, I took leave. 12. On the evening of the same day, when sitting with the King before dinner, I mentioned Sir L. Felly's journey, in connexion with the route followed by Captain de Gaury and myself. This led the King into a positive statement that Sir L. Felly had reached a definite agreement with his grandfather. He said that the document had been in the possession of the family in Riyadh but had disappeared. Fuad Bey joining in the conversation, I assured them most definitely that there was no trace in any British archives of any agreement other than the Fhn Mana letter, which had been published. One fact 1 said was quite certain, namely, that Sir L. Felly, unlike myself, had come to Riyadh without any instructions. The King said that the Felly mission and the despatch of Ibn Mana were entirely independent. He put the date of Felly’s visit some four years before the death of his grandfather, the Amir Feisal. (The King is clearly wrong in his dates as well as in his facts, but there can be no doubt that he sincerely believes that Sir L. Felly did conclude an agreement on the occasion of his stay in Riyadh.) 13. When Fuad Bey again called next morning, the 26th November, I referred to the conversation of the previous evening about Sir L. Felly’s visit. I offered to give him a note of the transactions at that time, being anxious, I explained, to dissipate any idea that His Majesty’s Government were holding back some agreement entered into by Felly, because it was favourable to the Saudi Government. Fuad Bey brushed aside this offer, and I did not encourage him in a suggestion of his own that it might be possible to give him copies of the actual correspondence. We then resumed the discussion of the frontier question, with Captain de Gaury in attendance. It would be difficult and useless to reproduce the whole of what passed, hut the following paragraphs represent adequately the main course of the conversation. 14. Fuad Bey said he had come to inform me of the King’s reaction to our proposal. He suggested that, although it was based, as I had explained, on new principles, their application was very limited. As regards the Jebel Nakhsh area, he referred to past correspondence between the Sheikh of Qatar and the King, through Ibn Jiluwi, in which the sheikh had asked, more as a favour than as a right, that the King should not claim Jebel Dukhan and the tract known as Araiq. The King had agreed, and, that being so, the King would now be prepared to abandon any claim to Araiq, although he, Fuad, had claimed it in earlier discussions. (This apparently refers to the “ Ariq ” mentioned in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April.) On the other hand, he pressed insistently the Saudi claim to Jebel Nakhsh, and urged that a frontier between the two Jebels would be a rational one based on physical features. As regards the Khor-al- Odeid, he began by saying that my arguments were sound, but presently he went back on the implications of this statement by reaffirming the claim to the Khor, though not, I think, as confidently as that to the Jebel Nakhsh. He tided to make out that our desire to maintain the continuity of the chain of States on the Gulf, however much it might rest on a historical basis, need not now prevent us from letting Ibn Saud have the Khor, which Fuad Bey described as economically necessary to Saudi Arabia, and which at one moment in the subsequent conversa tion he even described as the “ port of the Murra.” We had feared, he suggested, the intervention of extra-Arabian Powers. We need not fear Saudi Arabia. 15. Fuad Bey’s invocation of an agreement between the Sheikh of Qatar and the King gave me an opportunity of asserting our attitude in regard to direct relations between the rulers in special relations with us and Ibn Saud I reminded him of my statement of the previous day, that we were responsible for their foreign affairs and had responsibilities towards them. The question of our responsibilities to the Sheikh of Qatar had recently come into prominence owinoto the grant of the oil concession (which Fuad Bey had mentioned). We had promised the Sheikh protection, and we must be in a position to carry out that promise in any and every contingency, however little we might fear having to do ^ so. I suggested that this was a very real reason for objecting to direct ^ correspondence between the Sheikh and Ibn Sand on important matters. If we promised protection we must have the means of protection, and we must be the judges of what was necessary to provide us with the means. I adverted to the letter which Ibn Saud had addressed to the Sheikh of Qatar some months ago regarding the oil concession and to the subsequent correspondence to which it had given rise. That letter, I said, was in the nature of an ultimatum, backed by a threat, and we had protested as politely as possible. 1 he Saudi Government had taken exception to our protest, and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin had relied on the wording of article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda as defeating it. That article did not, however, stand alone. It had been led up to and it had been followed by the communication to Ibn Saud of our treaties with the rulers mentioned in it, a communication made by agreement, in order that he might have knowledge of the nature of the special relations of which he had taken cognisance in article 6 . 16. Fuad Bey said that the communication to which I referred did not include our treaty with Qatar. I questioned this, and said that it had certainly been intended to include it. It was a published document, and if he had not got it, I could let him have it at any time. Fuad Bey admitted that the question whether it had, in fact, been communicated was of no essential importance, but asked what the position would be if the direct agreement between the Sheikh of Qatar and Ibn Saud, which he had invoked, were antecedent to the Anglo-Qatar Treaty. I said I thought it would make no difference, as, although that treaty had not been concluded until 1916. Qatar had long formed part of the system of States in special relations with His Majesty’s Government. I reminded him, ■ speaking from memory, that, in the note communicating the agreements with the rulers named in article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, we had expressly said that our position did not rest only on treaty texts, but on a whole series of past f transactions. I also reminded him, again speaking from memory only, that Qatar was so much a concern of ours before the Anglo-Qatar Treaty of 1916 that it had, I thought, been the subject of a special chapter in one of the pre-war Anglo-Turkish conventions. The Anglo-Qatar Treaty of 1916 had merely reduced to written form pre-existing arrangements. Fuad Bey suggested that before the treaty of 1916 was concluded the Sheikh of Qatar was free to negotiate direct with Ibn Saud. Later in the discussion I asked whether the direct agree ment about the Jebel Dukhan and the Araiq was, in fact, antecedent to the Anglo-Qatar Treaty. Fuad Bey said it was. 17. I refused to entertain Fuad Bey’s claim to the Khor-al-Odeid. I maintained that, even if it were a means of maritime access to the neighbouring part of Saudi Arabia, no territorial claim could be founded on this any more than Ibn Saud could claim Koweit because it was, or ought to be, a port feeding the Saudi area inland. If the Saudi Government wanted an arrangement about trade through the Khor that was another matter. Fuad Bey enlarged the issue at this stage by saying that, if we reached an agreement about the frontier, it would be necessary to have some sort of frontier arrangements for administrative and suchlike purposes. He quoted the parallel of the arrangements in the treaties with Iraq and Transjordan. 18. I outlined the procedure which His Majesty’s Government had in view. My present object, I said, was to seek an agreement in principle regarding the frontier line. If this were arrived at, it would be necessary to embody it in a treaty, to which His Majesty’s Government would be parties, for themselves and the Sheikhs of Qatar and Abu Dhabi, and to which the Sultan of Muscat and Oman would also be a party. His Majesty’s Government had in view one matter, which came within the scope of what Fuad Bey had just said, but which I had not yet mentioned. I read paragraph 18 of Foreign Office despatch No. 309 of the 23rd October regarding the freedom of tribes to use their normal wells and grazing grounds on whichever side of the frontier they might be situated. Fuad Bey contemplated more general frontier arrangements. I doubted whether the conditions on the frontier now in question were similar to those on the Iraq and Transjordan frontiers, but, subject to the fact that I had no instructions other than' those I had read. I agreed that arrangements appropriate to the local conditions might well be embodied in an eventual treaty.« r i 19. I find that in the foregoing record of the earlier part of the discussion, I have omitted three points of some little importance as follows :— (а) At one moment Fuad Bey gave a definite hint that a bargain might be struck. (б) I reinforced my arguments regarding the special position of our Persian Gulf clients by saying that Ibn Baud was the most powerful ruler in Arabia, and that those other States had only such strength as they derived from their special relations with His Majesty’s Government. Had it been otherwise, I said, Ibn Baud would have before now absorbed Koweit and Qatar. Fuad smilingly asked whether this would harm our interests. I replied emphatically that it would. (c) Fuad Bey threw a question at me about oil possibilities in the Jebel Nakhsh. I told him that I thought there might be oil there, but that we had also reason to believe that there might be oil in the area south west of the Dohat-as-Salwa, and that we had not allowed the discovery of this possibility to deter us from making the Green Line offer at an earlier stage in the discussions. Fuad Bey tried to make out later that in claiming the Jebel Nakhsh so insistently, the Baudi Government were influenced only by considerations connected with the protection of Salwa in the event of raiding, &amp;c. 20. The second part of the conversation related to the south-eastern portion •of the proposed frontier. Before we had got far, Fuad Bey raised the point that the Saudi Government must respect the position of the King of the Yemen. They were themselves ready to waive any claim to tribes in the Hadhramaut hinterland, but they could not prejudice any claim which the Imam might have. I adverted to the fact that the Saudi-Yemen Treaty of 1934 did not deal with the Saudi-Yemen frontier east of Najran. I understood that that was because the Imam had refused to let it be defined lest his pretensions in the Hadhramaut should be prejudiced. After some little general discussion on this subject, I said that it would be hopeless to bring the King of the Yemen into the negotiation of a treaty regarding the frontiers now under discussion, but that the Saudi Government might possibly overcome their difficulty by attaching some sort of declaration to the effect that they did not wish to prejudice Yemen interests. I qualified this by adding that, if such a declaration were made, it should not mention the Hadhramaut as such. We should hold on to the Hadhramaut until all was blue. I added an intimation, speaking quite personally, that His Majesty s Government on their side might have some scruples about possible Yemeni interests in the area between the Violet Line and Najran. Fuad Bey said that no difficulty could arise here, because, while the Saudi-YYmen boundary east of Najran had not been defined, the Saudi and Yemeni Governments had an under standing based on the attribution of tribes in the area. 21. Fuad Bey intimated that our proposed line G-H—Violet Line was unacceptable. He put a general question as to whether I could offer any improve ment on our proposals as a whole. I said that I was not authorised to offer any further concessions in regard to the line south of Qatar, on which my instructions were quite categorical; or indeed in regard to any part of our proposals. I said guardedly, however, that as legalds one portion, \iz., the line J-G I deduced from the^ correspondence, though not from the text of my instructions, that His Majesty’s Government might be prepared to put the frontier in that part ratherjurther to the_east, if it would lead to an agreement, but that in this case it*~would Ye more than ever necessary to consult the interests of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. 1 made it clear that I was speaking only of the area between points J and G and had no sort of authority to go further than our proposal regarding G-H—Violet Line • t. i o t 22 Fuad Bey suggested that there would be no difficulty with the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. Tde would agree to any frontier, because of the trouble he had in his hinterland with two important personages, A1 Khurusi and A1 Khalili. Fuad Bey caught on to what I had said generally about a possible modification of the line J-G. He suggested that, if that line could be transferred to meridian 56° E„ it might be possible to devise a line further on inter mediate between our proposed line G-H—Violet Line and that proposed in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April He thought it would be preferable if this v / //&gt;/wv ns intermediate line could be defined with reference to places rather than to 1 co-ordinates. He was extremely non-committal and explained that he was only throwing out an “ idea ” of his own. Subject to this, he indicated a possible line from say the intersection of meridian 56° E. and parallel 20° N. to run midway through the Ramlat-al-Mughsin and thence to points approximately at the inter-w sections of meridian 52° E. and parallel 18 c N. and of meridian 50 c E. and parallel 17° N. 23. On a review of the whole discussion, Fuad Bey and 1 had to agree that we had not found the basis of an agreement in principle. I said that all I could do was to renew to him and to the King the appeal I had made on the previous day. Fuad Bey said that he had had to overcome great difficulties in his own high quarters in connexion with his own proposals. 1 explained that very great difficulties had had to be overcome on the side of His Majesty’s Government. Their proposal represented an honest effort to reconcile all the interests involved and I must again commend it earnestly to the acceptance of Ibn Saud. 24. My further conversation with Fuad Bey on the 26th November related to the Koweit blockade, but later that afternoon the King again received me and the audience was devoted entirely to the frontier question. Fuad Bey and Captain de Gaury were present. Only the general lines of what passed can be recorded as the King merely skirmished round the outskirts of a position on which he had clearly made up his mind not to give ground at present. He spoke at times with great vivacity, but with none of that bitterness which characterised his utterances to me at Taif last year. 25. I referred to my conversation with Fuad Bey in the morning and expressed regret that the King had found it impossible to accept a proposal which His Majesty’s Government had put forward after an honest endeavour to reconcile all the interests which they had to consider. My only remaining duty, I said, was to renew my appeal that he should entertain it favourably- If this appeal failed I must return to Jedda and report to His Majesty’s Government. What mattered was not that 1 was returning without having reached an agreement of principle, but that His Majesty’s Government would have great difficulty in going further than they had done. 26. The King echoed my regret that a settlement had not proved possible. He proffered the usual assurances that, whether this question were settled or no his friendship with Great Britain was unaltered and unalterable: He referred to the many sacrifices he had made in the past, and had made only for the sake of that friendship. He suggested that it mattered little if officials took a couple of years to settle questions. I find it difficult to recall all that His Majesty said in this connexion, but Captain de Gaury’s recollection is that he intimated that any differences were a matter for arrangement to be arrived at by modifications of view on both sides on an equitable basis. If I was not in a position to modify my proposals, that was my affair, and any delay in the negotiations could not be attributed to unwillingness on his part to reach a settlement. In the course of his remarks, he referred to the advantages of a method of question and answer, but he appeared to intend to leave the application of this to Fuad Bey and himself threw out only one question, of a somewhat rhetorical nature, as to what the fundamental causes of difference were. He made play also with the fact that in the treaty made with him in 1915 His Majesty's Government had undertaken to recognise his ancestral claims. At one moment he suggested lightly that, after all, the whole area in dispute was desert and that His Majesty's Govern ment could easily give him a bit more. 27. After the King had expounded his views on these lines for some time, I observed that, if I remembered rightly, the treaty of 1915 referred to his ancestral claims in named areas. I should be prepared to answer any questions and would now answer the only one he had put so far. The fundamental difficulty was that, though he was the greatest ruler in Arabia, he was not the only one who had ancestral claims. His position was simple, as he had only to assert his own claims. That of His Majesty's Government was difficult as they were in special relations with some of the rulers and in friendly relations, as between independent States, with Saudi Arabia. They had to accommodate conflicting claims and they had done their best to do so reasonably. They did not exaggerate the ancestral claims of their clients, e.p., they did not claim Hasa for Bahrein, merely because it was shown in old maps as belonging to the latter principality.28. This evoked a lively sally from the King who denied that Hasa had 'ever belonged to Bahrein though Bahrein might have belonged to Hasa. I ^replied that I was dealing only in examples. 29. The King asseverated that he and his brothers in religion, i.e., the coastal rulers had not wanted frontiers between them. He emphasised his friendship with them all and especially the Sheikh of Qatar, who would not be where he was had not he, Ibn Sand, helped him against his relatives. 30. I said that modern conditions had made frontiers necessary. New factors had arisen. How, for instance, had the present discussion started ? The King had given an oil concession in Hasa. (The King interposed that it was not he who had given it, but an English company, i.e., by letting the concession go to the Americans. He was poor, he said, and must live somehow.) The United States Government had then enquired what we considered to be the limits of Saudi Arabia. We had given the only reply we could, and had informed the Saudi Government of what had passed. I added that I did not wish to be misunderstood. Oil was not the only factor. Other factors had made frontiers necessary, e.cj., with Iraq and Transjordan. The point was that in modern conditions frontiers must be drawn, if causes of quarrel were to be avoided. 31. The King recognised the necessity for frontiers. He made some obscure reference in this connexion to the circumstances of the Great War. 32. All the King's statements were interspersed with assurances of friend ship. Towards the end he became almost fatherly and begged me not to worry overmuch as all would come right in time. I said that the King was in his own country and I hoped he would live for many years. I was a stranger and should be leaving next year. I should have liked to see this question settled before I went, not to gratify my vanity, but because I should not wish to leave behind me a possible cause of future strife. This sob-stuff elicited further amiabilities from the King, but otherwise left him unmoved. 33. When Fuad called on the morning of the 27th to discuss other business, I arranged to leave with him the map mentioned in paragraph 4 above, after having a copy made of the lines drawn in it. I also asked him for further information about the Araiq area (see paragraph 16 above). I attach a note made by Captain de Gaury from the explanations given by Fuad Bey. 34. On the 28th November Fuad Bey engaged me in a long private conver sation. Before passing to its principal subject, that of the relations of Saudi Arabia with Great Britain and Italy, he begged me to make a further effort to promote a settlement of the frontier question on a basis of compromise. He said, quite personally and non-committally, that if we could give way over the Jebel Nakhsh, he “ thought he could induce the King ” to give way over the Khor-al- Odeid. 35. Most of this record was written as the conversations proceeded in Riyadh, but I have corrected it somewhat and completed it in Jedda. ANDREW RYAN. Jedda, December 7. 1935. Enclosure 3. Descriftion of the Araiq Area given by Fuad Bey Hamza. Araiq, literally The small veins,'' i.e., of Sand. EAST of and within sight of Qasr Salwa are the water holes (Hissu) of Mishabiya. Between Qasr Salwa and Mishabiya is the palm grove of Umm-as-Samra, and this is surrounded by salty low-lying ground (Sabkha), usually called Sabkhat-as-Salwa. further east again is a sandy plain dotted with bushes called the Araiq. Its northern end reaches to near Jebel Nakhsh, and its southern end terminates in the Salama dunes south-east of Sikak. In the Araiq are many water holes, notably— (1) Abu Ghath. (2) Sai (i.e., in the courier road). (3) Ud Abu Samra (the largest group). (4) Jabanin.South of the Araiq is the Mishash-biu-Shah, and east of the Araiq begins the Qalail area, the Qalail being a series of small hills which begin north-east of Jebel Nakhsh. Between ISakhsh and Qalail passes the Hasa-Doha road. (The Mishash water points include the following :— Mishash-as-Samra, Mishash-al-Mifsal, Mishash-al-Maqdar, Mishash-al-Taz, Mishash Umm-as-Samra, and Mishash-bin-Shafi.)f COPY, (E 7574/77/91). -S ill FOREIGN OFFICE, S.VM. 27th January, 1936 Dear Dalton, You will have received under cover of our official letter No. E 7547/77/91 of 17th January copies in print of Sir Andrew Ryan's despatch No. 351 of the 10th Decemher last covering a note on his discussions at Riyadh with Ibn Saud and Fuad Bey Hamza on, airung other matters, the question of the south and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. S. In this letter, which I am writing in Rondel's absence on leave, I propose to deal only with certain points raised in Ry an' s de spa t ch viz : - (a) Fuad Hamza's argument (see paragraph 5 of the despatch) that 'as the Anglo-Qatar Treaty was not concluded until 1916, His Majesty's Government must respect an alleged earlier agreement by which the Sheikh of la tar recognised Ion Saud's right to the Jebel NakshF and (b) the allegation (see paragraph 12 of the note by Ryan) by Ibn Saud 'that Sir L. Felly had reached a definite agreement with his grandfather.' 3. As regards (a) above I think it would be as well if you would consult the Political Authorities in the Persian Gulf and endeavour to ascertain whether any light can be thrown on the alleged correspondence between the Sheikh of patar and the late Ibn Jilawi to which Ryan refers in his telegrain No# 215 of the 8th December last, a copy of which was sent you under our E 7149/77/91, and furnish us with such material as may be available to refute Fuad Hamza’s assertions on this point. on, Ef q. , .

As regards (Id) it appears quite clear from paragraph 110 et oeq. of India Office memorandum P.Z„ 5600/1934, B 437, that there was no such agreement, and, subject to your observations, wo woaId propose to instruct Ryan to reply categorically to Fuad Karas a to that effect. 5. Yrith regard to the insistence of the Saudis on the inclusion of the Jebel ilahsh within the Saudi boundaries, I don’t think there can be much doubt that oil is at the bottom of their anxiety and than considerations connected with the protection of Salva do not really weigh very heavily with them. 6. In paragraphs 26 and 27, Ryan shows that the King attempted to invoice the 1915 Treaty with His Majesty’s Government and their recognition of his ancestral claims, but it is quite clear - as Ryan pointed oat to him - that these ancestral claims referred only to Hejd, Kasa, Qatif and Jubail and the towns and ports belonging to them, and by no stretch of imagination can these be held to extend to any part of Qatar. 7. The outcome of these discussions between Ryan and the Saudi Government will of course necessitate another meeting of the Middle East (C) Sub-Committee, but I should prefer to await the result of your enquiries under (a) above before suggesting a date for the meeting. I hope however that we may all be ready to hold it some time towards the niddle of Februa ry. Yours sincerely, (Signed) J.C. ST3RKDALE BEITKETT.NO DISTR IBUTION , Decyphero Sir A.

I agree that existence of alleged agreement would have to be proved in due course if His Majesty’s Government admitted Fuad’s contention that Sheikh Q. was a free agent for international purposes before 1916 and that a (?direct) agreement concluded between him and Ibn Saud at that time must be considered binding on His Majesty’s Government. It is this question of principle which is troubling me at present. Its importance in my eyes is increased by paragraph 1 of Political Resident’s telegram No. 83 to India Office where he gives somewhat analogous reason for considering position of Sheikh of Koweit as regards foreign relations to be different from that of other states named in Article 6 of Treaty of Jedda. I am sending by oag my comments on this suggestion. Addressed to Foreign Office telegram No. 18, repeated to India telegram No. 8, Bushire telegram No. 7.( 6 ) NO DISTRIBIITION l \\ (E 612/152/^).

Following is for your confidential information: If Sheikh of Qatar had before 1916 concluded a treaty engagement with Ibn Saud by which he had recognised latter’s sovereignty over any specific area such as Jebel Nakhsh, arrangement would have taken effect at once and would there fore not necessarily have been invalidated by 1916 Treaty between His Majesty's Government and Qatar, although the effect on any such engagement of Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 defining the Blue Line is another matter, which would require separate consideration. But it appears from Bushire telegram No. 92 [of February 1st] to India Office that [unless the Sheikh is misleading us) no such agreement exists, and I am therefore inclined to favour course proposed in para graph 2 of Bushire telegram No.113 [of February 6th] to India Office. Main effect of 1916 Treaty would be to supersede as from that year any previous standing arrangements which might be incompatible with conduct of Sheikh’s foreign relations by His Majesty’s Government. But this would not invalidate any inde pendent action taken and completed by the Sheikh before that date. Question of position in regard to Koweit, raised in Bushire telegram No.83 [of January 29th1 to India Office to which you refer, need not affect your attitude as regards Qatar.

I have not so far made use of this despatch as I had anticipated the general line of argument in my conversations at Riyadh and it seemed preferable to continue to treat the question at issue as subsidenary to frontier settlement (see your telegram No. 123). So far as negotiations here are concerned I should still much prefer adherence to this course but it occurs to me that the recent trend of negotiations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq (see correspondence ending with your telegram No.17 to Bagdad) may make it desirable as a matter of more general policy to reassert without delay the views of His Majesty’s Government regarding the position between Ibn Saud and Persian Gulf rulers. Reasons for this would be stronger if His Majesty’s Government's reaction to '^He king's refusal of their frontier proposals is likely to be much longer delayed. ./hat are your views? If you wish me to pursue separately the question of Ton Gaud’s attitude towards Persian Gulf rulers I shall need material for reply to Puad’s argument that we are in any case bound by alleged agreement entered into by Gheykh of Qatar before 1916 (see paragraph 16 of enclosure to my despatch No. a 51} &lt; Addressed to Foreign office No.14, repeated to Government of India no.5, Bushire No.4 and Bagdad No.6.'

Dear vValton, You will have received under cover of our official letter No. E 7574/77/91 of 17th January copies in print of Sir Andrew Ryan^ despatch No.351 of the 10th December last covering a note on his discussions at Riyadh with Ibn Saud and Fuad Bey Hamza on, among other matters, the question of the south and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. 2. In this letter, which I am writing in Rendel's absence on leave, I propose to deal only with certain points raised in Ryan’s despatch viz:- (a) Fuad Hamza’s argument (see paragraph 5 of the despatch) that M as the Anglo-Qatar Treaty was not ’’concluded until 1916, His Majesty’s Government must 'respect an alleged earlier agreement by which the 'Sheikh of Qatar recognised Ibn Saud’s right to the 'Jebel Naksh' and J,C• Walton, Esq.,G.B.,M.C. /(b) X(Id) the allegation (see paragraph 12 of the note hy Ryan) hy Xbn Saud ^that Sir Pelly had ’♦reached a definite agreement with his grandfather^ “ 3. As regards (a) above I think it would he as well if you would consult the Political Authorities in the Persian Gulf and endeavour to ascertain whether any light can he thrown on the alleged correspondence between the Sheikh of Qatar and the late Ihn Jilawi to which Ryan refers in his telegram No.215 of the 8th December last, a copy of which was sent you under our S 7149/77/91, and furnish us with such material as may be available to refute Fuad Hamza’s assertions on this point* 4* As regards (b) it appears quite clear from paragraph 110 et seq« of India Office memoi'andum P.Z* 5620/1934, B 437, that there was no such agreement, and, subject to your observations, we would propose to instruct Ryan to reply categorically to Fuad Hamza to that effect. 5. With regard to the insistence of the Saudis on the inclusion of the Jebel ffeksli within the Saudi /boundaries.-■boundaries, I don’t think there can be much doubt that oil is at the bottom of their anxiety and that considerations connected with the protection of 3alwa do not really weigh very heavily with them. 6. In paragraphs 26 and 27, Ryan shews that the King attempted to invoke the 1915 Treaty with His Majesty’s Government and their recognition of his ancestral claims, but it is quite clear - as Ryan pointed out to him - that these ancestral claims referred only to Nejd, Hasa, Qatif and Jubail and the towns and ports belonging to them, and by no stretch of imagination can these be held to extend to any part of Qatar. 7. The outcome of these discussions between Ryan and the Saudi Government will of course necessitate another meeting of the Middle East (0) Sub-Committee, but I should prefer to await the result of your enquiries under (a) above before suggesting a date for the meeting. I hope however that we may all be ready /to^5. Notes. Register No. Minute Paper. P. z. 438/36. SECRET. POLITICAL DEPARTMENT Dated Dec. 193 Date. Initials. To Under Secretary Secretary of State... /.

CONFIDENTIAL. Section 3. [ E 7574/77/911 Sir A. Ryan, to Sir Samuel Hoare.—(Received December 30.) (No. 351.) Si r Jedda, December 10, 1935. WITH reference to my telegram No. J215 y)f the 8th December, I have the honour to forward herewith copies of the note, based on your telegram No. 13’2 of the 18th November, by which I informed luad Bey on the 25th November of the proposals of His Majesty’s Government regarding the eastern and south eastern boundaries of Saudi Arabia, together with a record of my conversations, on the subject in Riyadh and an annexed note by Captain de Gaury of what Fuad Bey told me about the Araiq area. 1 have thought it desirable to make the record of conversations as full as possible. 2. When I went to Riyadh I was in some doubt as to whether Ibn Saud was really keen on a settlement of the question or would prefer to maintain Ids claims of the 3rd April intact rather than agree to any compromise. The impression I got during the discussions was that the King, though out for a bargain, and a hard one, was genuinely desirous of an agreement. It became moie and more apparent to me as we went on that the most crucial issue, though by no means the only one, was the Jebel Nakhsh . 3. The form taken by the conversations in Riyadh made it difficult for me to adhere strictly to the’ order of the arguments set forth in your despatch No. 309 of the 23rd October, but the record will show that I made full use of them all with the King or with luad Bey Hamza, or with both. 4. I had in mind throughout the first two sentences of paragraph 13 ot the despatch just quoted regarding the finality of the new British offer. I was all the more anxious to emphasise the views of His Majesty s Government regarding their position vis-a-vis the Sheikh of Qatar and the other Persian Gulf rulers, and more particularly to let the King understand that any active interference in the south of the Qatar Peninsula would involve him m a dangerous clash with His Majesty’s Government. The possibility of such interference is to my mind the chief disadvantage that might lesult fiom leaving the whole question unsettled, now that His Majesty s Government have made an offer handsome enough to deprive Ibn Saud of any reasonable gi ound foi his former grievance that His Majesty’s Government were living to denv his ancestral claims and to come the Turk over him. , . . T 5. You will notice that, although the King made a reference, which J preferred to ignore, to his relations with his Arab neighbours, luad Bey did not openly on this occasion contest my arguments as to the effect of our treaties with the Persian Gulf rulers and article fi of the Treaty of Jedda. In dealing with this subject I anticipated to a large extent the instructions in your despatch No. 334 of the 19th November, which reached me on the 8th December. Kiad Bey has a far better legal brain than Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, and, instead of sustaining the Sheikh’s thesis, he developed a more ingenious argument of his own namely, that as the Anglo-Qatar Treaty was not concluded unti 1916, His Majesty s Government must respect an alleged earlier agreement by which the Sheikh of Qatar recognised Ibn Saud’s right to the Jebel Nakhsh. \ou will doubtless instmct me as to how I should reinforce my extempore counter argument., especially if enquiries on the Persian Gulf side disclose any reason for accepting Fuad Bev’s suggestion that the sheikh had before 1916 recognised Ibn baud s right to the Jebel Nakhsh. • n , „ , ‘ 6. I And that, owing to my lack of preparedness for luad Bey s argument. I overlooked one point, which I think had escaped him also namely, that a former Sheikh of Qatar entered into special relations with His Majesty s Government bv a formal agreement, dated the 12th September, 1868. you may think it possible to make use of this fact, even though the agreement of 1868 did not give His Majesty’s Government control of the foreign relations ot Qatar. 8261 [581 gg—3] iCu ICik^u'ikh B7. If His Majesty’s Government adhere strictly to the terms of the first two sentences of paragraph 13 of your despatch No. 309 of the ^3rd Octobei, there must, I think, be a prolonged deadlock. That may be no bad thing m all the circumstances. I cannot personally think, though I write with gi eat deference to other views that it would really matter much if His Majesty s / Government were to agree to a compromise in the southern area, but I am ^ conscious of the great difficulty of giving up the Jebel Naksh. In this connexion it would be useful for me to have for my own use a sketch, showing the limits ot the oil concession area and of the protection area in the south of Qatar. I was shown a sketch of this kind in London, but my files here do not seem to contain definite information regarding the two areas. 8. I would draw attention to two other matters which I did not consiuei it necessary to mention in my telegram under reference. The first is what luad Bey said, as set forth in paragraph 20 of the enclosed record, about the position vis-a-vis the Yemeni Government. I trust that you will approve of the general line which I took in regard to this unexpected subject. The other matter has to do with the proceedings of Colonel Felly in and about 1865 (see paragiaphs 12 and 13 of the record). This is only important as a matter of con\ me mg Ibn Snud of the good faith of His Majesty’s Government. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Bushire, Bahrein and Aden. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure 1.

I ARRIVED in Riyadh late in the afternoon of the 23rd November. Ibn Sand received myself and my staff next morning, but the audience was one of courtesy only. That day, the 24th November, after luncheon, Fuad Bey expressed a wish to have a general talk about the business side of my visit. It had already been made pretty clear that the Saudis fully expected official matters to be discussed during my stay, and Fuad Bey started our conversation on the 24th November by asking me what I had in view. I explained that I had come equipped with instructions on various subjects and that, as on previous occasions. I should welcome an opportunity of stating to the King in person the views of His Majesty’s Government, although His Majesty would probably wish me to discuss the details with his advisers. I reviewed the questions which had been discussed with Fuad Bey in London in July. I had new instructions regarding the question of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. This. I said, was the most important outstanding question. I would put second the question of Saudi-Koweit economic relations, and third that of the prolongation of the validity of the Treaty of Jedda, with the three connected questions of slavery, arms traffic and the language of the treaty. I had instructions on all these matters. I had instructions on the question of air facilities also, but I thought it might be better to leave that until after my return to Jedda. As for the Transjordan question, the position was that we were expecting a reply to the letter which Mr. Rendel had written to Fuad Bey on the 19th July. 2. This record deals only with the question of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers. In our conversation on the 24th November I explained to Fuad Bey the general nature of my new instructions. I emphasised the position of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Arab States on the Persian Gulf. Fuad Bey might, I said, dislike the pretensions of a non-Arab State to concern itself with Arabian affairs, but they were founded on an historic evolution. We could not contemplate a break in the line of States with which were in special relations. On the other hand, we were sincerely desirous of a settlement of the frontier question, and the new proposals I had brought took the fullest possible account of the desiderata which the Saudi Government had put forward. I stressed the fact that the new proposals were not merely an advance on the offers which His Majesty’s Government had previously made, but were based on a new method of approach to the question, that of readiness to meet Saudi views handsomely when we could do so, e.g., in regard to the country of the Murra tribe, the dim of which proved, in fact, to be much more extensive than we had supposed; but we must at the same time safeguard other essential interests. I pointed out that, in applying this new method, we had gone so far that further concessions could not be expected. I also said that they were subject to the assent of the Sultan of Muscat, whom we had wished to consult, but who was out of reach, when the matter had got to this stage. 3. Fuad Bey preserved the role of an attentive listener. He did not demur v . to my proposal to give general explanations to the King in person, but was clearly anxious to have our proposals as soon as possible. I thought it politic to promise to let him have on the 25th November a note of our proposals and to show him a map to illustrate their effect. 4. Fuad Bey called on the 25th November shortly before the time fixed for my audience with the King to present the insignia of the G.C.B. We had a short general conversation, which I need not record in detail. Its only interest lay in the fact that Fuad Bey got on to the old familiar theme that His Majesty’s Government never considered Ibn Saud sufficiently, and had always returned evasive answers to his professions of friendship and a desire for close collabora tion with them. He spoke of the King’s grievances. I riposted, as usual, by saying how greatly His Majesty’s Government valued the King’s friendship, but insisting that we had always believed the best way to consolidate mutual friend ship was to clear up outstanding questions. (I will revert to this part of the conversation when recording separately my conversations regarding the Koweit blockade.) Before we parted, I gave Fuad Bey my note of His Majesty’s Govern ment’s new proposals regarding the eastern and south-eastern frontiers and lent him a copy of the latest edition of Hunter’s 1 in. = 32 miles Map of Arabia.showing the line now proposed and that, which the Saudi Government had asked for on the 3rd April, so far as it could be drawn in from the indications in the Saudi memorandum of that date in the absence of all the geographical information necessary to identify certain of the places named therein. There was no time for discussion, but Fuad Bev manifested disappointment at the exclusion of Sufuk from Saudi territory. I told him that that place was much closer to the Sabkhat-al-Matti than as shown in Hunter’s map and was marginal to the Sabkhat. 5. After the formal G.C.B. audience, I remained with the King to talk business. As he apparently wished the conversation to be private, I asked Mr. Oppenheim and Mr. Ousman to withdraw. Fuad Bey remained in attendance. So did Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and the King's four eldest sons, but they all sat discreetly at the other end of the room. Captain de Gaury acted as interpreter. 6. I reminded the King of our conversations at Taif in July 1934. Since then I said Fuad Bey had been twice in London, and there had been much discussion of outstanding questions. 1 indicated to the King, as 1 had already done to Fuad Bey, the three subjects which I particularly wished to pursue in Riyadh. As regards the frontier question, I recalled the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April and the counter-offer which I had then made. Fuad Bey had said during his subsequent visit to London that the Saudi claims rested on a considered appreciation of tribal considerations, whereas the counter-offer rested on nothing at all (Fuad Bey grinned). I could not accept this view of our counter-offer, but I admitted that it was very limited. After Fuad Bey had left London His Majesty's Government had studied very carefully the information he had supplied and had collected information from other sources. All this information led up to the new proposals which I had given to Fuad Bey just before the audience. I wished to indicate the bases on which they rested. They were twofold. 7. On the one hand, His Majesty’s Government were responsible for the foreign affairs of Qatar and the Trucial Sheikhdoms. They had responsibilities towards these States. They could not agree to deprive the Sheikh of Qatar ol any portion of the main block of that peninsula by ceding the Jebel Nakhsh or to isolate the sheikhdom by agreeing to a line drawn right across the base of the peninsula. As regards the Khor-al-Odeid, they had consistently recognised that it belonged to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. I would not take the King through all the objections to the line his Government had proposed, but I would mention two other points. His Majesty's Government were not in charge of the foreign affairs of the Sultan of Muscat, but he was bound to them by many ties and they must consider his interests very carefully. Their information regarding the Hadhramaut tribes showed that their range extended a good deal further north than the Saudi Government had supposed. 8. I had indicated, 1 said, the objections to the baudi proposals of last April. I now turned to our second basis, which was more favourable to the Saudi Government. We had gone deeply into the question of the distribution of tribes. We did not think that an allocation of tribes as such could provide a frontier, having regard to the other historical, political and geographical factors, but we did think that great account should be taken of tribal considerations. We had done this in preparing our new proposal, and especially as regards the Murra. We had found that the dira of that tribe was, as Fuad Bey had told us, much more extensive than we had supposed. 1 would give two instances in which tj W e had modified our views. We were relinquishing Banaiyan, which we had Mi at first honestly believed to lie in the domain of Abu Dhabi. In the south we were willing to concede Shanna. Fuad Bey had given us a list of, I thought, 162 wells claimed for the Murra. We had not been able to identify them all, but I believed that, when the King studied our proposal, he would find most of them included in our offer. . 9. 1 intimated to the King that the further we had gone to meet his views the more difficult it would be 'to increase our offer in any way. I ended by commending it earnestly to his acceptance, saying that it would be very unfortunate if, through failure to reach a settlement now, we were thrown back on irreconciliable positions, we on our original legal theory, he on his claims of the 3rd April. 10 The King thanked me for my statement and expressed gratification at the general nature of our new proposals.' He used language suggesting fairly clearly,[581 gg—3] b 3 though not precisely, that we had now the basis of a settlement, for which he appeared to be eager. He said that he wished to make two points at the outset. He wished for the best relations with His Majesty s Government. He also wished for the best relations with the neighbour States. He would not pursue the discussion further at this stage, but he wished to emphasise these tw r o points- 11. I said that I quite understood the King's inability to reply in detail on this occasion to a proposal which I had only just communicated to Fuad Bey. I took note with satisfaction of what he had said as regards his desire for good relations with His Majesty's Government. I thought it politic to say nothing at this stage about his second point. As I had been with him by this time for about an hour and a half and it was time for the midday prayer, 1 took leave. 12. On the evening of the same day, when sitting with the King before dinner, I mentioned Sir L. Felly’s journey, in connexion with the route followed by Captain de Gaury and myself. This led the King into a positive statement that Sir L. Felly had reached a definite agreement with his grandfather. He said that the document had been in the possession of the family in Riyadh but had disappeared. Fuad Bey joining in the conversation, I assured them most definitely that there was no trace in any British archives of any agreement other than the Ibn Mana letter, which had been published. One fact I said was quite certain, namely, that Sir L. Felly, unlike myself, had come to Riyadh without any instructions. The King said that the Felly mission and the despatch of Ibn Mana were entirely independent. He put the date of Felly s visit some four years before the death of his grandfather, the Amir Feisal. (The King is clearly wrong in his dates as well as in his facts, but there can be no doubt that he sincerely believes that Sir L. Felly did conclude an agreement on the occasion of his stay in Riyadh.) 13. When Fuad Bey again called next morning, the 26th November, I referred to the conversation of the previous evening about Sir L. Felly s visit. I offered to give him a note of the transactions at that time, being anxious, I explained, to dissipate any idea that His Majesty’s Government wore holding back some agreement entered into by Felly, because it was favourable to the Saudi Government. Fuad Bey brushed aside this offer, and I did not encourage him in a suggestion of his own that it might be possible to give him copies of the actual correspondence. We then resumed the discussion of the frontier question, with Captain de Gaury in attendance. It would be difficult and useless to reproduce the whole of what passed, but the following paragraphs represent adequately the main course of the conversation. 14. Fuad Bey said he had come to inform me of the King’s reaction to our proposal. He suggested that, although it was based, as I had explained, on new principles, their application was very limited. As regards the Jebel Nakhsh area, he referred to past correspondence between the Sheikh of Qatar and the King, through Ibn Jiluwi, in which the sheikh had asked, more as a favour than as a right, that the King should not claim Jebel Dukhan and the tract known as Araiq. The King had agreed, and, that being so, the King would now be prepared to abandon any claim to Araiq. although he, Fuad, had claimed it in earlier discussions.’ (This apparently refers to the “ Ariq ” mentioned in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April.) On the other hand, he pressed insistently the Saudi claim to Jebel Nakhsh, and urged that a frontier between the two Jebels would be a rational one based on physical features. As regards the Khor-al- Odeid, he began by saying that my arguments were sound, but presently he went back on the implications of this statement by reaffirming the claim to the Khor, though not, I think, as confidently as that to the Jebel Nakhsh. He tried to make out that our desire to maintain the continuity of the chain of States on the Gulf, however much it might rest on a historical basis, need not now prevent us from letting Ibn Saud have the Khor, which Fuad Bey described as economically necessary to Saudi Arabia, and which at one moment in the subsequent conversa tion he even described as the “ port of the Murra.” We had feared, he suggested, the intervention of extra-Arabian Powers. We need not fear Saudi Arabia. 15. Fuad Bey’s invocation of an agreement between the Sheikh of Qatar and the King gave me an opportunity of asserting our attitude in regard to direct relations between the rulers in special relations with us and Ibn Saud. I reminded him of my statement of the previous day, that we were responsible for their foreign affairs and had responsibilities towards them. The question of our responsibilities to the Sheikh of Qatar had recently come into prominence owingto the grant of the oil concession (which Fuad Bey had mentioned). We had promised the Sheikh protection, and we must be in a position to carry out that promise in any and every contingency, however little we might fear having to do so. f suggested that this was a very real reason for objecting to direct correspondence between the Sheikh and Ibn Sand on important matters. If we promised protection we must have the means of protection, and we must be the judges of what was necessary to provide us with the means. I adverted to the letter which Ibn Saud had addressed to the Sheikh of Qatar some months ago regarding the oil concession and to the subsequent correspondence to which it had given rise. That letter, I said, wa.s in the nature of an ultimatum, backed by a threat, and we had protested as politely as possible. The Saudi Government had taken exception to our protest, and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin had relied on the wording of article (&gt; of the Treaty of Jedda as defeating it. That article did not, however, stand alone. It had been led up to and it had been followed by the communication to Ibn Saud of oui* treaties with the rulers mentioned in it. a communication made by agreement, in order that he might have knowledge of the nature of the special relations of which he had taken cognisance in article 6. 16. Fuad Bey said that the communication to which I referred did not include our treaty with Qatar. I questioned this, and said that it had certainly been intended to include it. It was a published document, and if he had not got u° U t i et , him ^ ave ^ at an y ti 1116 - Fuad Bey admitted that the questfon whether it had, m fact, been communicated was of no essential importance but asked what the position would be if the direct agreement between the Sheikh of Qatar and Ibn Saud, which he had invoked, were antecedent to the Anglo-Qatar 1 reaty. I said I thought it would make no difference, as, although that treaty had not been concluded until 1916, Qatar had long formed part of the system of States in special relations with His Majesty’s Government. I reminded him, speaking from memory, that, in the note communicating the agreements with the ui eis named in article 6 of the 1 reaty of Jedda, we had expresslv said that our position did not rest only on treaty texts, but on a whole series of past transactions. I also reminded him, again speaking from memory only, that Qatar was so much a concern of ours before the Anglo-Qatar Treaty of 1916 that it had I thought, been the subject of a special chapter in one of the pre-war Anglo-1 urkish conventions. The Anglo-Qatar Treaty of 1916 had merely reduced to written form pre-existing arrangements. Fuad Bey suggested that befoi e the treaty of 1916 was concluded the Sheikh of Qatar was free to negotiate dnect with Ibn Saud. Later in the discussion I asked whether the direct agree- n \^ a n°f 1 t T G J f be P u K han an P the Al 'aiq was, in fact, antecedent to the Anglo-Qatai 1 reaty. Fuad Bev said it was. • V■ j 'u f ' ,se&lt;J t0 entertain Fuad Bey’s claim to the Khoi-al-Odeid I maintained that even if it were a means of maritime access to the neighbouring flvn, ?hAl' dl i Al 'u ia i n0 ^ mtorl \ l1 ‘-laim.could be founded on this any more than Ibn baud could claim koweit because it was, or ought to be a nort feeding the Saudi area inland. If the Saudi Government wanted an arrangement atout trade through the Khor that was another matter. Fuad Bey enlarged the issue at this stage by saying that, if we reached an agreement about thf frontier ^ would be necessary to have some sort of frontier arrangements for administrative and suchlike purposes. He quoted the parallel of'the arrangements n the treaties with Iraq and Transjordan. 18. I outlined the procedure which His Majesty’s Government had in view M\ piesent object, I said, was to seek an agreement in principle regarding the frontier line. If this were arrived at, it would be necessary to emlSdi it m a tieaty to which His Majesty s Government would be parties, for themselves and the Sheikhs of Qatar and Abu Dhabi, and to which the Sultan of Muscat and Oman would also be a party. H.s Majesty’s Government had in view one matter which came within the scope ot what Fuad Bey had just said, hut which I had not yet mentioned. I read paragraph 18 of Foreign Office desn-mh w^onor the 23rd October regarding the freedom of tribes to use thOr'normal wells and grazing grounds on whichever side of the frontier they mioffit be situated nS Bey contemplated more general frontier arrangements. I doubted whether the conditions on the frontier now ,n question were similar to those on the Iraq and Transjordan frontiers but. subject to the fact that I had no instructions other than those I had read, I agreed that arrangements appropriate to the focal conditions might well be embodied m an eventual treaty. e 10caI19. I find that in the foregoing record of the earlier part ol the discussion, I have omitted three points of some little importance as follows : (a) At one moment Fuad Bey gave a definite hint that a bargain might he struck (b) I reinforced my arguments regarding the special position of our Persian Gulf clients by saying that Ibn Saud was the most powerful ruler m Arabia, and that those other States had only such strength as the\ derived from their special relations with His Majesty s Government. Had it been otherwise, I said, Ibn Saud would ha\e beloie now absorbed Koweit and Qatar. Fuad smilingly asked whether this would harm our interests. I replied emphatically that it would (c) Fuad Bev threw a question at me about oil possibilities m the debel Nakhsh. 1 told him that I thought there might be oil there, but that we had also reason to believe that there might be oil m the area south west of the Dohat-as-Salwa, and that we had not allowed the discovery of this possibility to deter us from making the Green Line offer at an earlier stage in the discussions. Fuad Bey tried to make out later that in claiming the Jebel Nakhsh so insistently, the Saudi Government were influenced only by considerations connected with the protection of Salwa in the event of raiding, &amp;c. 20. The second part of the conversation related to the south-eastern portion of the proposed frontier. Before we had got far, Fuad Bev laised the point that the Saudi Government must respect the position of the King of the Yemen. They were themselves ready to waive any claim to tiibes m the Hadhiamaut hinterland, but they could not prejudice any claim which the Imam might have. I adverted to the fact that the Saudi-Yemen Treaty of 1934 did not deal with the Saudi-Yemen frontier east of Najran. I understood that that was because the Imam had refused to let it be defined lest his pretensions in the Hadhramaut should be prejudiced. After some little general discussion on this subject, I said that it would be hopeless to bring the King of the Yemen into the negotiation of a treaty regarding the frontiers now under discussion, but that the haudi Government might possibly overcome their difficulty by attaching some sort of declaration to the effect that they did not wish to prejudice Yemen interests. s I qualified this bv adding that, if such a declaration were made, it should not mention the Hadhramaut as such. We should hold on to the Hadhramaut until all was blue. I added an intimation, speaking quite personally, that His Majesty s Government on their side might have some scruples about possible Yemeni interests in the area between the Violet Line and Najran. Fuad Bey said that no difficulty could arise here, because, while the Saudi-YYmen boundary east of Najran had not been defined, the Saudi and YYmeni Governments had an under standing based on the attribution of tribes in the area. T r- i 21. Fuad Bey intimated that our proposed line G-H—Violet Line was unacceptable He put a general question as to whether I could offer any improve ment on our proposals as a whole. I said that I was not authorised to offer any further concessions in regard to the line south of Qatai, on which m) instructions were quite categorical; or indeed in regard to any part of our proposals. I said guardedly, however, that as regards one portion, viz., the line j_G I deduced from the correspondence, though not from the text of my instructions, that His Majesty’s Government might be prepared to put the frontier in that part rather further to the east, if it would lead to an agreement, but that in this case it would be more than ever necessary to consult the interests of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. 1 made it clear that I was speaking only of the area between points J and G and had no sort of authority to go further than our proposal regarding G-H—Violet Line. 22 Fuad Bey suggested that there would be no difficulty with the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. Tie would agree to any frontier, because of the trouble he had in his hinterland with two important personages, A1 Khurusi and A1 Khalili. Fuad Bey caught on to what I had said generally about a possible modification of the line J-G. He suggested that, if that line could be transferred to meridian 56° E., it might be possible to devise a line further on inter mediate between our proposed line G-H—Violet Line and that proposed in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April. He thought it would be preferable if thiss # intermediate line could be defined with reference to places rather than to&gt; co-ordinates. He was extremely non-committal and explained that he was only throwing out an “ idea ’ of his own. Subject to this, he indicated a possible line from say the intersection of meridian 56 E, and parallel 20° N. to run midway through the Ramlat-al-Mughsin and thence to points approximately at the inter sections of meridian 52° E. and parallel 18° N. and of meridian 50 E. and parallel 17° N. 23. On a review of the whole discussion, Fuad Bey and I had to agree that we had not found the basis of an agreement in principle. I said that all I could do was to renew to him and to the King the appeal I had made on the previous day. Fuad Bey said that he had had to overcome great difficulties in his own high quarters in connexion with his own proposals. 1 explained that very great difficulties had had to be overcome on the side of His Majesty’s Government. Their proposal represented an honest effort to reconcile all the interests involved and I must again commend it earnestly to the acceptance of Ibn Baud. 24. My further conversation with Fuad Bey on the 26th November related to the Koweit blockade, but later that afternoon the King again received me and the audience was devoted entirely to the frontier question. Fuad Bey and Captain de Gaury were present. Only the general lines of what passed can be recorded as the King merely skirmished round the outskirts of a position on which he had clearly made up his mind not to give ground at present. He spoke at times with great vivacity, but with none of that bitterness which characterised his utterances to me at Taif last year. 25. I referred to my conversation with Fuad Bey in the morning and expressed regret that the King had found it impossible to accept a proposal which His Majesty's Government had put forward after an honest endeavour to reconcile all the interests which they had to consider. My only remaining duty, I said, was to renew my appeal that he should entertain it favourably- If this appeal failed I must return to Jedda and report to His Majesty’s Government. What mattered was not that I was returning without having reached an agreement of principle, but that His Majesty's Government would have great difficulty in going further than they had done. 26. The King echoed my regret that a settlement had not proved possible. He proffered the usual assurances that, whether this question were settled or no his friendship with Great Britain was unaltered and unalterable. He referred to the many sacrifices he had made in the past, and had made only for the sake of that friendship. He suggested that it mattered little if officials took a couple of years to settle questions. I find it difficult to recall all that His Majesty said in this connexion, but Captain de Gaury's recollection is that he intimated that any differences were a matter for arrangement to be arrived at by modifications of view on both sides on an equitable basis. If I was not in a position to modify my proposals, that was my affair, and any delay in the negotiations could not be attributed to unwillingness on his part to reach a settlement. In the course of his remarks, he referred to the advantages of a method of question and answer, but he appeared to intend to leave the application of this to Fuad Bey and himself threw out only one question, of a somewhat rhetorical nature, as to what the fundamental causes of difference were. He made play also with the fact that in the treaty made with him in 1915 His Majesty’s Government had undertaken to recognise his ancestral claims. At one moment he suggested lightly that, after all, the whole area in dispute was desert and that His Majesty’s Govern ment could easily give him a bit more. 27. After the King had expounded his views on these lines for some time, I observed that, if I remembered rightly, the treaty of 1915 referred to his ancestral claims in named areas. I should be prepared to answer any questions and would now answer the only one he had put so far. The fundamental difficulty was that, though he was the greatest ruler in Arabia, he was not the only one who had ancestral claims. His position was simple, as he had only to assert his own claims. That of His Majesty's Government was difficult as they were in special relations with some of the rulers and in friendly relations, as between independent States, with Saudi Arabia. They had to accommodate conflicting claims and they had done their best to do so reasonably. They did not exaggerate the ancestral claims of their clients, e.g., they did not claim Hasa for Bahrein, merely because it was shown in old maps as belonging to the latter principality.a 2*. This evoked a lively sally from the King who denied that Hasa had •ever belonged to Bahrein though Bahrein might have belonged to Hasa. I replied that I was dealing only in examples. 29. The King asseverated that he and his brothers in religion, i.e., the coastal rulers had not wanted frontiers between them. He emphasised his A friendship with them all and especially the Sheikh of Qatar, who would not be where he was had not he, Ibn Saud, helped him against his relatives. 30. I said that modern conditions had made frontiers necessary. New' factors had arisen. How, for instance, had the present discussion started ? The King had given an oil concession in Hasa. (The King interposed that it was not he who had given it, but an English company, i.e., by letting the concession go to the Americans. He was poor, he said, and must live somehow.) The United States Government had then enquired what we considered to be the limits of Saudi Arabia. We had given the only reply we could, and had informed the Saudi Government of what had passed. I added that I did not w r ish to be misunderstood. Oil was not the only factor. Other factors had made frontiers necessary, e.g., with Iraq and Transjordan. The point was that in modern •conditions frontiers must be drawn, if causes of quarrel were to be avoided. 31. The King recognised the necessity for frontiers. He made some obscure reference in this connexion to the circumstances of the Great War. 32. All the King's statements were interspersed with assurances of friend ship. Towards the end he became almost fatherly and begged me not to worry overmuch as all would come right in time. I said that the King w 7 as in his ow n country and I hoped he would live for many years. I was a stranger and should be leaving next year. I should have liked to see this question settled before I went, not to gratify my vanity, but because I should not wish to leave behind me a possible cause of future strife. This sob-stuff elicited further amiabilities from the King, but otherwise left him unmoved. 33. When Fuad called on the morning of the 27th to discuss other business, I arranged to leave with him the map mentioned in paragraph 4 above, after having a copy made of the lines drawn in it. I also asked him for further information about the Araiq area (see paragraph 16 above). I attach a note made by Captain de Gaury from the explanations given by Fuad Bey. 34. On the 28th November Fuad Bey engaged me in a long private conver sation. Before passing to its principal subject, that of the relations of Saudi Arabia wdth Great Britain and Italy, he begged me to make a further effort to promote a settlement of the frontier question on a basis of compromise. He said, quite personally and non-committally, that if we could give way over the Jebel Nakhsh, he “ thought he could induce the King ” to give way over the Khor-al- Odeid. 35. Most of this record w 7 as written as the conversations proceeded in Rivadh, but I have corrected it somewhat and completed it in Jedda. ANDREW RYAN. Jedda, December 7, 1935. Enclosure 3.

During the visit Colonel Loch asked the Shaikh for a guide for next day’s flight and two Bedouins were summoned by the Shaikh; when these two men heard what was asked of them they retired to consider the problem and then fled from QATAR.

I explained general character of new proposal to Puad on Novdmber &amp;ith. On Novemtor 25th I gave him note ox them with an Illustrative imp. Before he could study them I explained to the King personally the basis of the proposals and urged them most strongly on his acceptance. 2. On November 26th Fuad replied on behalf of the King. He described proposal as unacceptable and was specially insistent on inclusion of Jebel Haksh in Saudi- Arabia. He reasserted claim to Khcr Al Odeid also but less confidently. I was adamant about both but hinted guardedly at possible ertension of our offer east of line J. to G. Fuad intimated readiness to consider intermediate line between ours from G. to H. and on to Violet line and line which they had claimed on April 3rd in this area. 3, I renews d to King personally that afternoon appeal to accept proposal of His Majesty’s Government but without success. 4. Fuad ! s most important new point regarding Qatar boundary was that we were asking for more for Sheykh than he himself had claimed in the past. Fuad maintained that Sheykh had at one time begged Ibn Baud more as a favour than as a right to leave him undisturbved in Jebel Dukhan ...Dulchan and .iraiq. The King had accept,ea this at the time and no longer wished to press claim to Araiq which had. tee made in memorandum of April 3rd tut he would not give up Jebel Naksh. Fuad asserted that correspondence on this subject between Sheykh and Ibn Jiluv/i was prior to jinglo-^atar treaty of 1913 0 He suggested that Sheykh was then a free agent and that agreement with Ibn Jiluv/i was therefore juridically binding. Ke also urged that Jebel Naksh was necessary for defence of 3alwa and that a frontier between it and Jebel Dukhan would correspond with natural features. 5. I resisted these arguments to the best of my ability. My impression was that Fuad ! s instructions were to keep Jebel Naksh at all costs but that the King would abandon Khor A1 Odeid in exchange, 'his was confirmed by non-committal personal language of Fuad's visit. (strongly) 6 0 I asserted!strong j position of His Majesty's Government in regard to coastal rulers generally and enphasised promise of protection which they had given to Sheyk of ^atar 0 7. Principal advance made so far is that the King no longer approaches matter with the titterness which he displayed last year at Taif. He realises that he cannot secure all that he asked for in memorandum of April 3rd hut he hopes to bargain for better terms than His Majesty’s Government have offered, I gave him and Fuad no encouragement to expect further concessions, 1 told the latter that in any case you were unlikely to decide anything pending receipt of detailed report, 3 0 Conversations covered wide range of other subjects to which I cannot do justice by telegraph.

A meeting had now become necessary as there were slight points of variance between the boundary suggested in the instructions to Sir Andrew Ryan and that suggested by Colonel Loch under the headings (l)^^) anc ^( 3 ) of telegram No. 150 of 4th November, 1935; it was also necessary to agree on certain points which had been left in suspense when Sir Andrew Ryan * s instructions were drafted. Pro nosed boundary line_from the soa to key point 'B'. A discussion ensued on the proposed boundary line from the sea to ke;y point ’B ? (see paragraph 16(a) and (b) of Sir Andrew Ryan’s instructions). Both this line and the revised line suggested by Colonel Loch were shown on a map circulated by Mr. Rendel at the meeting. MR. RENDEL explained that there was little real diver gence of opinion as between the line suggested by the Foreign Office and that suggested by Colonel Looho The latter had emphasised the necessity for leaving certain places, mentioned in his telegram, to the west and north of the Sabhhat el Amra, and more particularly for leaving the route between Doha and Abu Dhabi, which passes to the west of the uabkhat el iunra, on the Abu Dhabi side of the boundary. The Foreign Office sav; no objection to this, although it might mean shifting the line between key points f A’ and f B f rather further to the west than had at first been contemplated. After discussion it was generally agreed to recommend that this portion of the boundary line should now run for about ten miles due south-east from a point, on the coast of the Dohat-as-Salwa situated four miles to the north-east of the point v/here the sea is nearest to Qasr-as-oalwa: thence in a straight line to a point midway between Haluwain and Nakhala. The instructions should make it clear that the places referred to in Colonel Loch’s tele gram should be left on the Abu Dhabi side of the boundary.Continuance of iprorosed bo undary li ne from point , b , v MR. RRNDKL explained that it had always been contem plated that the line beyond hey point ’B f should be so drawn as to leave the whole of the Sabkhat Matti to Abu Dhabi ? that it had long been and/realised that the eventual fixing of key point ’B’ would probably necessitate the establishment of a new key point f C f so as to secure this object. lie had himself suggested in one of his letters to Mr. v/alt on that this key point f C might be at the intersection of parallel and meridian , which would mean a line down to parallel almost identical with that suggested by Colonel Loch - and if anything slightly more favourable to Abu Dhabi. This would secure to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi all the places in this neighbour hood to which he had any kind of claim. hie could see no reason ? however, for prolonging this line in the same direction right down to parallel 22 as suggested by Colonel Loch. Provisional agreement had already been reached between the foreign Office and the India Office for a line running to the intersection of parallel 22 with meridian 5t&gt;. But the Foreign Office had been much impressed with the views of the doverament of India, as summarised in Mr. walton ! s letter of 30th October, and in the light of these views and of the information obtainable from other sources, he felt that the best policy would now be to offer Ibn Saud the line suggested in his letter of 4th November to Mr. Walton. MR. WALTON replied that Colonel Loch's and Colonel Fowle’s recent telegrams showed that the case for admitting Ibn Baud’s authority up to meridian 53 was not established, and that the Bultan of Muscat and Oman might have good claims to the west of that meridian.*MR. RISND&amp;L pointed out that Sir Andrew Ryan was likely to have the greatest difficulty in reaching a settlement with Ihn Saud, ana that the more the line he was authorised to offer Ihn Saud approximated to the line claimed hy Ihn Saud himself, the more hope there would he of an agreement being reached. We could not go any further to meet Ihn Saud’s views, either in the north or in the souttu In this eastern sector, however, it looked as though we should not he sacrificing the interests of any of our proteges hy going somewhat further. There had at one time been two schools of thought - the first aiming at keeping Ibn Saud back as far as possible at all coats, the second aiming at meeting him as far as possible and concentrating mainly on safeguarding the legitimate and reasonable claims of the other \rab rulers concerned. He felt that the time hau come when no progress would he made if the former school were followed. kR. V/ALTOIT said that at previous meetings the Foreign Office vie?/ had been that the eastern boundary should be an intermediate line between the eastern limit of Ihn Saud’s actual jurisdiction and the western limit of muscat. It had never been suggested that Ibn Saud should be given the whole of this vacuum. The idea had been to divide the vacuum so as to leave space for the ultimate extension of actual authority on either side, ana there was no reason now for altering the principle and saying that we could not hold Ibn Saud back against a vacuum. 2 R. RHIT.,EL said he haa never meant to suggest that the whole of the vacuum should be given to Ibn Saua. In actual fact the Sultan of muscat ana Oman only controlled territory running a very short distance inland from the coast, so that even if the line were carried as far as meridian 56, there would still be a d e facto vacuum onthe non-oaudi side of it* Cn the other hand ^ tiiO line which he had suggested in his letter of 4th I:ovember to Mr, ..alton was an attempt to find a line corresponding approximately to the eastern limit of the dreat hands, as shown in Thomas’ map. The Great bands in this area, any rate to the south of parallel bo, and as distinct from the steppe country to the east of them, were a single geographical unit. A line based on the eastern ed^e of tho bands would therefore be more or less defensible. Our information all went to suggest that any tribes in trie a-reat Sands looked to Ibn baud rather tnan to Muscat, whereas it was reasonable to regard the tribes oi tne steppe country as looking towards F'uscat and the coast. Any other line was likely to be more difficult to defend. In reply to the Chairman, he said that tne line claimed by Ibn baud (marked in red on the map circulated to the meeting) appeared to be an arbitrary line in this area, of much the same type as some of the lines which ha a been put forward by Eis Majesty’s Government. Ibn oaud had clearly put his claim as far to the east as possible in order to ensure that any vacuum mignt be on his side of the line. Our object was to divide the vacuum more or less equally. MR. wALT ON, referring to the eastern boundary being on meridian 55 or 55, said that the bultan of Muscat had not yet been formally consulted and that he might have some claim to this area. The Government of India’s suggestion had been based on an informal conversation between the Sultan and Major Bremner, the tenour of which had been misapplied and as a result thereof the Government of India had suggested offering up to meridian 56 e -5-He then recalled the various proposals which had been -6- ^ put forward regarding the eastern boundary. In the first place the Foreign Office had suggested that this boundary should run along meridian 52 and that between meridians 52 and 55 there should be a desert zone. Later the proposal for a desert zone had been abandoned and the eastern boundary extended in stages to meridians 53 and 54 ? and now, subject to confirmation by the present meeting, to meridian 55. This meant that not only uhe original area tut also the desert zone was to be offered in full sovereignty to Ibn Laud. The India Office considered it unsafe to go further east than meridian 55, the main reasons being that they did not yet know what claims the Sultan of Muscat would put forward. They had information that the Muscat tribes had grazing grounds extending into the Great Sands. By going to meridian 55 we were already giving away some territory over which certain Muscat tribes had grazing grounds. If we went to meridian 56 we were giving away considerably larger wedges of the grazing area. It would in any case be necessary to inform the oultan of Muscat before the offer of even meridian 55 was made in principle, as in due course a treaty would be made with Ibn oaud laying down the frontiers between Ibn Saud*s territory, and that of the True!al Sheikhs, etc. If it were decided to offer up to meridian 56 we should definitely have to obtain the consent of the Sultan of Muscat. MR. RLNDLL said that, while he could not accept all that Mr. Walton had said about the recent history of this question, he thought nothing would be gained by pursuing this aspect of the matter. . In point of fuct both the Foreign Office and the India Office were trying to attain the same object, which was, in the general interest of His Majesty’s Government, to secure a reasonable and soundsettlonifent of this question. It had become clear in the course of the summer that I bn Baud felt most strongly about it end that it v/as likely to be a matter of the greatest diffi culty to reach any agreement v/ith him which fell short of conceding his claims. «e could not offer 1 bn eaud more favourable terms either in the north or in the south, and the only sector where we could approximate to his line without sacrificing our own interests or those of our proteges was the eastern sector. Sir A. Ryan T s task was likely to be one of very great difficulty. The only object of the Foreign Office in suggesting further ’concessions’ to Ibn baud in this area was to facilitate Bir A. Ryan’s task, to bring about a final settlement and to avoid the breach v/ith Ibn oaud which was likely to follow if negotiations broke down, and which might have very serious results. From the point of view of our national and Imperial interests, everything was to be gained by reaching a settlement with Ibn Baud, the main tenance of friendly relations with whom was of great importance to us, not only from the point of view of the international situation generally, and of the position in the Middle Fast and in the Red Sea area in particular, but also from the point of view of India and of our re lations towards the Indian Moslems. But we were far more likely to reach a settlement if we made a generous offer now, than if we waited to m?ke it under pressure and in less favourable circumstances later. The Foreign Office, therefore, in urging their present proposals, were thinking only of the general interest of his Majesty’s Government; but they had at no time lest sight of the importance of fulfilling all our obligations towards our _-vrab prot6ges and adequately protecting their interests.MRo WALTON said he shared the Foreign Office view regard ing the necessity for friendship with Ihn Sand and that the suggestion for a general settlement had come from the India Office. Our proteges on the Trucial coast and the Sultan of Muscat must; however, he considered. MR 0 RENDEL then explained that the Sultan of Muscat was an independent sovereign and that we had no right to do any~ tlung regarding his territory unless he asked us to do so* When we had been discussing the eastern frontier against a vacuum,Muscat had not been affected. It had always been realised, however, that Muscat would sooner or later have to be brought in. and now that the interests and rights of Muscat were under direct discussion, it seemed impossible to ignore the Sultan of Muscat altogether. On the other hand, Ibn Saud had put us in a strong position by making his pro posals to His Majesty's Government direct, and it should be remembered that the whole question arose out of the proposed alteration of the boundary originally laid down by the Anglo- Turkish Conventions of 1S13 - 1914, to which Muscat had not been a partya In reply to a question, he added that the maintenance of existing tribal grazing rights etc., was, of course, already covered by Sir Andrew Ryan's instructions, THE CHAIRMAN said that early action v/as necessary in view of the close approach of Sir Andrew Ryan’s visit to Ibn Saud. MR, RENDEL explained that Sir . .ndrew Ryan v/as due to leave Baghdad on the 14th instant and to arrive at Riyadh on the 22nd, It would be possible, however, to catch him by telegraph either at Koweit or Bahrein, whence he expected to leave for Saudi Arabia on 20th November. THE CHAIRMAN then suggested that the Sub-Committee might agree to the new line proposed by the Foreign Office running to the east of meridian 5C°Eo provided that it was ascertained- 9 - ■by urgent telegraphic enquiry of the Authorities in the Persian Gulf that the interests of the Sultan of Muscat would not be prejudiced. MR. WALTON agreed that this could he done, hut said that the India Office were not prepared to exercise any pressure. They would, however, put forward objectively the views held on this question. MAJOR OSBORNE said that some time ago the War Office had suggested that the eastern boundary should run to meridian 56. They still held the same view. He under stood that neither the foreign Office nor the India Office thought that Muscat or Ihn Sand could establish a claim to this area, and asked what would be the position if neither of these two States could establish a claim to meridian 55 or meridian 56. WING COMMANDER PIRIS stated that the Air Ministry sym pathised with the Foreign Office view, and that owing to the great difficulty Sir Andrew Ryan would have in reaching agreement with Ibn Baud, they were quite prepared to agree to the eastern boundary being fixed at meridian 56, provided it could be established that the authority of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman did not extend at any point beyond this meridian. A discussion then ensued on the details of the eastern boundary, and it was agreed that the line should run from point 'B* in a straight line to the intersection of meridian 52°E. and parallel 23°N. Two alternatives regarding the line to be offered south-east of the intersection of meridian 52°E. and parallel 25° N. were considered. Firstly, that the following line might be offered, namely from the inter section of meridian 52°E. and parallel 23°N. in a straight line to the intersection of meridian 55° E. and parallel22°N. thence down to Meridian 55° E. to its intersection with parallel 20° N. Secondly, if enquiries, which the India Office undertook urgently to make oi the Politicai Resident and the Sultan of Muscat, should shew tuat no Abu Dhabi interest would be affected by the first section (below) or that no Muscat interest would be adversely affected by the second and third sections, the following line might be offered in y j --uce of that defined above, namely from the intersection of meridian 52° E. and parallel 2d h. to the intersection of meridian 52° 40' E. and parallel 22° 40’ N. thence to the intersection of meridian 55 o 40’ E. and parallel 22^ H. thence to the intersection of merxdian 55° E. and parallel 20° IT. Finally it was agreed to approve of the remainder of the boundary, suggested in paragraph 16(d) of the foreign Office instructions to Sir .Andrew Ryan (Despatch ho: 30w dated 2drd October, 1905, circulated as paper No: M.E.(0) 914). CONCLUSIONS . THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed:- (a) That it was desirable at the present time to inform the Sultan of Muscat of uie negotiations and to consult him on the point mentioned in paragraph e(ii) below. (b) That the boundary line to be offered to Ibn Sand should run for about ten miles due south-east from a point on the coast of the Dohat-as-SaIwa situated four miles to the north-east of the point where the sea is nearest to Qasr—as— Salwa. (c) ^hat the line should run thence in a straight line to a ooint midway between Haluwain and Nakhala; and that the line should in any case be drawn so as to leave Nakhala, Aqalat-al~Manasir, Farhud, Rimth and Khafus and^ the ^ Doha - Abu Dhabi route (to the west of Sabkhat-al-Axnra) to Abu Dhabi ; _ and Sakak, Anbak (Manuk), Bil DeIrish, Haluwain and Raghuwan to Saudi Arabia.4T sr * r\ (d) That the line should run thence in a straight line to the intersection of meridian 59° E. and parallel 95° N. (e) As regards the line to be offered south-east of the point reached by the foregoing, two alternatives wore considered r~ (i) It was agreed that the following line might he offered, viz: from the inter section of meridian 52° E, and parallel 23° N. in a straight line to the inter section of meridian 55° E, and parallel 22° N., thence down to meridian 55° E. to its intersection v ith parallel 20° N. (ii) It was, however, also agreed that if enquiries, which the India Office undertook urgently to make of the Political Resident and the Sultan of muscat, should shew that no Abu Dhabi interest would be adversely affected by the first section (below) or that no Muscat interest mould be ad versely affected by the second and third se c t ions, the foil ov;i ng line might be offered in place of that defined in (i) above, viz: 1. from the intersection of meridian 52° S. and parallel 23° N. to the intersection of meridian 52° 40 T E. and parallel 22° 4-0’ N. , 2. thence to the intersection of meridian 55° 40* E. and parallel 22° N., 5, thence to the intersection of meridian 55° E. and parallel 20° N. (f) Prom this point (i.e. the intersection of meridian 55° E. and narallel 20° N.) it was agreed that the frontier should run as conditionally provided for in para graph 16(c) of Poreign Office despatch No: 309 of the 23rd October to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, circulated as Paper Ho: M.E,(0) 194, ■ |- 12 - PART II.

II .E . (G) 193 . THE CHAIHHA1T explained that at their 9th Meeting the Standing Ministerial Sub-Committee for ..uestions Concerning the Middle East expressed the view that the question of providing and maintaining road communication between Baghdad and Haifa should be actively pursued. Subsequently the Colonial Office summoned an inter-departmental committee, as a result of which the High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan had been consulted and asked to prepare estimates of cost* It seemed undesirable to consider the present application in detail until these figures had been received and examined. But a preliminary consideration was the political aspect, seeing that the Directors of Palestine Corporation Limited, v/ith one exception were Jews, and it was, he thought, doubtful whether in Transjordan, and perhaps also in Palestine, a Jewish Corporation should be given a concession for the construction of the trans-desert road and a monopoly of the road traffic on this route. In reply to a question regarding the probable attitude of Iraq to this proposition, HR. RENDEL said he considered that the fact that the scheme was put forward by Jews and involved a monoplly of transport in this area would lead to great difficulties with Iraq, and he doubted whether, even if the scheme were strongly supported by us, it would be possible to get the Iraqi Government to agree to it.4 * the in the she the Pal and the the tha who an mak The Sir wh o con tha adv sch pos of to- 13 - THE CHAIRMAN raised the question T/h ether the terns of the mandate would permit the grant of a monopoly of this kind in Palestine and Transjordan. IIH. RENDEL observed that the test was whether it was in the interests of the mandated Territories that such a concession should he granted. THE CKAIEHAiT agreed with this view. The Chairman said there was also the economic side to he considered. The Palestine Corporation scheme envisaged a Government guarantee, and he asked whether the Treasury representative had any views on the scheme. IIP. HALE said he clearly could not give a definite view on the economic side of the proposition at present, hut pointed out that the proposal necessitated a Government loan to cover the whole cost of the project. IIP. RENDEL considered that it would he difficult to secure an income on any capital loan. He did not think it possible to make a transport monopoly for a road running through desert. There would also he strong competition from the Damascus route, HR. BLAXTER said that the scheme had 'been submitted to Sir John Campbell, the Financial adviser to the Colonial Office, who was of opinion that the figures so far provided did not carry conviction and need much further elucidation. He had suggested that it would he advisable for the Colonial Office engineering advisers to examine the proposals. He was critical of the scheme generally at its present stage and was doubtful of the possibilities of getting a return on the capital. HAJOR OSBORNE said the Mar Office regarded the construction of a road as an urgent necessity, hut they were of course, unable to comment on the practicability of the scheme under discussion.-14- WING COMMANDER ITRIE agreed with this view hut stated that the type of road required hy the Air Ministry would cost only £200,000 whereas the one proposed hy the Palestine Corporation was estimated to cost £1 million,, In reply to a question hy the Chairman, MR. RENDER suggested that it would he inadvisahle to inform the Iraqi Gcvernmenc of the project at present, as difficulties might he raised which might prevent our getting a practical scheme through later. He suggested that we should inform our Ambassador at Baghdad of the project, hut that as it might not he proceeded with there would he no advantage in communicating the project to the Iraqi Government, owing to the possibility of an adverse reaction on their part. In reply to a question hy Major Oshorne regarding the possibilities of constructing an extension of the railway from Baghdad to Nisihin, MR. RENDER said that for the present the negotiations had broken down. The French were showing signs of reluctance to link up railway construction with the fortunes of the British Oil Development Company, The Iraqi Government were probably waiting for the conclusion of the general negotia tions regarding the transfer of the Iraqi railways. Y/hen these had been completed - possibly, say, in six months’ time - he v/ould not he surprised if the Iraqis re-opened the question of the Baghdad-Nisihin railway. He doubted whether this question would he affected hy the Daghdad-Haifa road, as he considered the Baghdad-Nisihin line to he inevitable in any case, and that it would almost certainly carry traffic of quite a different type - e-.g. through traffic to and from Europe - from that carried hy a road to Palestine and southern Syria, which v/ould presumably carry chiefly local traffic or traffic to Egypt.-15- THE CHAIRMAN said that ho had only put forward this matter for a preliminary discussion, and that an interim reply to the Palestine Corporation, having been sent, it would now he necessary to examine the project further, in consultation with the High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan.

October 23, 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. |_E 6087/77/91] Sir Samuel Hoare to Sir A. Ryan (on leave). Sir, Foreign Office, October 23, 1935. HIS Majesty’s Government are anxious to take advantage oi your forth coming visit to King Abdul Aziz at Riyadh to resume, and it possible to advance* the negotiations which have been proceeding for a settlement ot the eastern and south-eastern boundaries of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Indeed, it is probable that King Abdul Aziz himself will raise this question with you at an early stage, as I understand that it is one on which he feels strongly; and it is in tact the most important major question at issue between this country and Saudi Arabia at the present time. 2. You will recollect that after His Majesty’s Government had decided not to take their stand, so long as negotiations were proceeding, on a rigid adherence to the legal basis provided by the frontier laid down in this region by the Anglo- Turkish agreements of 1913-14, you were instructed, in November 1934, to open negotiations with the Saudi Government for an agreed settlement of this question by endeavouring in the first place to obtain an exact statement of King Abdul Aziz’s territorial claims. The Saudi Government’s response to your enquiry was delayed for several months, but they eventually furnished you, on the 3rd April last, with a memorandum putting forward a claim to a vast area in South-Eastern Arabia, which was asserted to correspond to the areas frequented by certain tribes owing allegiance to King Abdul Aziz. You were already awmre from the previous consideration which tlis Majesty’s Government had given to the matter that they were unable to entertain such extensive demands, and you therefore proceeded^ immediately to the next stage contemplated in your instruc tions and offered to Saudi Arabia a small strip of territory—the so-called “ green line ” concession—immediately to the east of the 1913-14 boundary. The subsequent departure of the Deputy Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs from Jedda rendered an immediate continuance of negotiations impossible, but the discussions were resumed with Fuad Bey Hamza himself during his visit to London last summer. 3. Despite the offer which was then made by His Majesty’s Government of a further territorial concession (bounded by the so-called “ brown line ”), it unfortunatelv proved impossible to reconcile the divergency between the point of view of His Majesty’s Government (as then agreed upon between all the various departments of His Majesty’s Government concerned) and that of King Abdul Aziz; and, on Fuad Bey’s*departure towards the end of July, the discussions closed in what appeared to be a complete deadlock. 4. It was explained to the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs during the course of these discussions that His Majesty’s Government were prepared, with a view to reaching an amicable settlement, to make limited concessions, to the east of the 1913-14 boundary, of territory which, like that comprised in the areas already offered to the King, could be shown to be predominantly utilised by tribes* or settlements recognising his sovereignty. His Majesty’s Government considered, however, that no satisfactory or durable frontier could be constructed on a purely tribal basis, in view of the shifting- allegiance of the nomad tribes and of their wide and overlapping migrations. Tribal considerations were valuable where it could be shown that an area was predominantly or exclusively frequented by a certain tribe with an exclusive political allegiance, but historical, geographical and strategic considerations would also have to be taken into account. The object of His Majesty’s Govern ment was not to establish a rigid frontier in the European sense, but to work out a boundary as equitable as could be attained from all points of view, which would remove sources of uncertainty and friction by defining the territorial 8167 [12260] blimits within which Saudi Arabia and the other Arab States concerned would respectively be free to exercise full sovereignty. Fuad Bey Hamza replied that his Government considered that the only basis for a settlement was to establish and allocate the grazing grounds in accordance with the political allegiance of the desert tribes concerned. He maintained that the statement of King Abdul Aziz’s demands was drawn up on the basis of the grazing grounds of four tribal groups, in particular of the widespread Ahl Murra tribe, who acknowledged Saudi sovereignty; and, in support of the line claimed by King Abdul Aziz, he communicated the names of 161 wells said to be owned by that tribe. Fuad Bey criticised the concessions offered by His Majesty’s Government as being purely arbitrary and not in accordance with the material facts of the situation in the desert. The Saudi Government had, he said, worked out, after the most searching investigation and enquiry, a carefully plotted and rational boundary which took account of the political and tribal situation, and they were prepared to provide detailed evidence in support of their proposal; he insisted therefore that the next move lay with His Majesty’s Government, and that, if they did not agree with Saudi claims, it was for them to produce a detailed statement of their criticisms. Hitherto, he asserted, His Majesty’s Government had merely replied to the Saudi proposals by the simple counter-offer of an arbitrarily limited narrow area which failed to take account of the material facts. 5. His Majesty’s Government are reluctant to acquiesce in a continuance of the deadlock reached in the conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza last summer, without making any further attempt to reach an agreed settlement. As you yourself have advised, so long as this frontier question remains in its present indefinite state it stands in the way of the general and lasting settlement of Anglo-Saudi differences which His Majesty’s Government are anxious to bring about. Moreover, the rapid development of oil exploitation on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf renders it very desirable that a definite limit should be drawn between territories which would be recognised as being under the sovereignty of King Abdul Aziz on the one hand, and as being under that of the rulers of Qatar, of the Trucial Coast States and of Muscat on the other. You will recollect that only in September last Flis Majesty endeavoured to stop the grant of an oil concession by the Sheikh of Qatar to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, on the ground that part of the concession area was included in his territorial claims. If the frontier is not settled there is a risk that similar difficulties may arise from the exploitation of the oil deposits in the Trucial Sheikhdoms if oil concessions should be granted therein. 6. It is clear, therefore, that every effort should be made, especially at the present critical juncture in world affairs, to reach an agreed settlement of the dispute, to put an end to an uncertain and unsatisfactory situation, and to remove a source of friction which has already had an unfortunate effect upon the general course of Anglo-Saudi relations. With this object in view His Majesty’s Government, after obtaining fresh information from the British authorities of the Persian Gulf and of the Aden Protectorate, have reconsidered the whole question, and they are prepared to go to the extreme limit of concession in the endeavour to formulate new proposals to meet the claims of King Abdul Aziz in the greatest possible measure. They have accordingly decided to authorise you to seek a favourable opportunity during the course of your forth coming visit to Riyadh to resume negotiations in the matter, if possible with King Abdul Aziz himself, but otherwise with his Ministers, and to furnish you with the following instructions for your guidance. 7. You will begin by informing King Abdul Aziz that, as a result of the conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza last summer in London, the whole question of the frontiers in South-Eastern Arabia has been fully reconsidered by His Majesty’s Government, after consultation with the local British authorities in Arabia. In particular His Majesty’s Government have re-examined the boundary claimed by King Abdul Aziz, as described in the memorandum communicated to you on the 3rd April last, in the light of the detailed evidence supplied by Fuad Bey Hamza, of the arguments advanced by him in the course of discussion, and of the further information collected by the British authorities in the areas concerned. You will then express in general terms the earnest desire of His Majesty’s Government to go as far as possible to meet the wishes of King Abdul Aziz in an amicable settlement of the question, laying stress at the same time on the long-standing treaty obligations of His Majesty’s Government towards3 the independent rulers of the Arab States in South-Eastern Arabia. \ ou should emphasise the importance which His Majesty’s Government attach to their historic position in the Persian Gulf, and the impossibility of their agreeing to any solution which might in any way prejudice or impair that position or injure the interests of the Arab States with whom they are in special treaty relations. / ' 1 / 8. At this stage you may at your discretion decide to inform King Abdul Aziz that you are in possession of new proposals by His Majesty s Government. Before describing these proposals you desire, however, to make it clear why His Majesty’s Government, after full and sympathetic enquiry into the material facts of the situation, have not felt able to accept the boundary which the King had himself suggested. You should then proceed to explain in detail the reasons which prevent His Majesty’s Government from accepting the boundary proposed in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April last, developing for this purpose the relevant arguments used in discussion with Fuad Bey Hamza last summer as set out in the records of the meetings. 9. Beginning at the northern end of the proposed Saudi line you should point out the importance which His Majesty’s Government attach to establishing a frontier in accordance with geographical, as well as political and tribal, considerations. The Qatar peninsula forms a clearly defined and sepai ate geographical unit, and it is only reasonable that the frontier between the Sheikhdom and its neighbours should follow the natural division between the peninsula and the mainland. His Majesty s Government have already expiessed readiness to depart from their strict 'legal position by recognising King Abdul Aziz’s sovereignty as extending over the western shore of the gulf known as the Uohat-as-Salwa and over the Ikhwan settlements at the head of the Gulf; but thev could never consent to attribute to Saudi Arabia features, such, foi example, as the Jebel Naksh, which form an integral part of the physical stiuctuie of the Qatar Peninsula itself and have always, in fact, been an equally integral part of the Sheikhdom. An additional factor in regard to the fiontiei of Qatai is the grant by the Sheikh to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, with the full approval of His Majesty’s Government, of an oil concession ovei the Sheikhdom of Qatar. This concession, which was granted on the 11th May last, while not extending bevond the limits of the State of Qatai as claimed b\ the Sheikh of Qatar and recognised as his territory by His Majesty’s Government, does actually extend to the south of the line claimed by King Abdul Aziz (cf. paragraph 5 above); but the position in this respect will be alieady known to His Majesty through the communication which I instructed Mr. Calvert to make by my telegram No. 112 of the 20th September, should you decide to adveit to this development, you should take the opportunity to recall the fact that His Majesty’s Government have formally assured the Sheikh of Qatar of their protection against any interference with his territorial rights. 10. Turning to the problem of the Khor-al-Odeid (to which Fuad Bey Hamza attached special importance), you will explain to King Abdul Aziz that, as Fuad Bey was informed in London, His Majesty’s Government have long recognised officially the validity of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi s claim to the whole of this inlet, and have regarded his territory as extending round both the Khor-al- Dhuwaihin and the Khor-ai-Odeid up to a line, running westwards from the northern side of the mouth of the Khor-al-Odeid, which forms the boundary between the territory of Abu Dhabi and that of Qatar. His Majesty s Govern ment naturally cannot violate or disregard their obligations to these Arab rulers with whom, as the King has recognised by article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, they have long-standing and special treaty relations. Should you consider it wise or desirable' to do so, you are authorised to develop frankly to the King a further argument which was used with Fuad Bey Hamza in London ; namely, that His Majesty’s Government have had for many years a particularly strong interest in the chain of Arab States on the coast 1 between Qatar and Muscat; that the maintenance of this position is an important principle of British policy in the Persian Gulf; and that it would be at complete variance with this policy for them to agree that a powerful State such as Saudi Arabia should acquire a new outlet to the sea on this section of the coast, to which neither political nor geographical considerations entitle it. II Pursuing your reply to the claims put forward in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April, you should explain that a thorough reinvestigation of the [12260] B 2situation has now been made by the British authorities in the 1 ersian Gul in order to ascertain the precise limits of the territory of the sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi in the hinterland of the coastal strip. As a result it has been established that the district known as A1 Aqal, the Sabkhat Matti salt marshes, and the districts shown on the maps as Bainunah, Dhafrah and Quiat-ai-Liwa, all of which lie outside the area predominantly covered by the Ahl Murra tribe, are within the historic possessions of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. His Majesty s Government are accordingly unable to agree to the eastward prolongation of the proposed boundary being carried as near to the sea coast as suggested in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April, since this would m their opinion, be incompatible with their obligation to protect the rights of the Sheikh of \bu Dhabi Similarly, they can find no justification for the extension o± the claims of King Abduf Aziz as far east as meridian 56° since this would result in the inclusion in Saudi territory of the steppe country beyond the Great bands and of the grazing grounds of tribes owing allegiance either to the Sheikh ot Abu Dhabi or to the Sultan of Muscat. 12 You will then inform King Abdul Aziz that the tribal position on the southern fringe of the Ruba-al-Khali desert and in the northern part of the Hadhramaut has also been the subject of detailed remvestigation smce the state ment of his boundary claim was received last April. As a result His Majesty s Government are satisfied that the tribes depending on the Aden Protectorate—and hi particular the A1 Saiar, A1 Manahil, Ahl Kathir and Ahl Mahra-nornially ran-e not only to the edge of the Great Sands between parallels 17 and 19 North, but for some little distance into the sands themse ves. You should explain that His Majesty’s Government were informed by Fuad Bey Hamza, during the course of the conversations in London last summer, that King Abdul Aziz did no claim the allegiance of these tribes, and their enquiries have now definitely shown that the southern and south-eastern limits of the district predominantly frequented by the Ahl Murra (which they understand to form the basis of the Saudi claims in this area) do not extend to the edge of the sands, but he a considerable distance to the north and north-west of the line claimed m the Saudi memorandum^ then proceed formally to put forward the new offer which His Majesty’s Government, in the light of the foregoing considerations, have now resolved to make, emphasising once more that it is made with ever .Y de si r . e to meet the wishes of King Abdul Aziz to the furthest possible extent, but adding m no ambiguous terms that it represents a final concession which His Majestv s Government will not be able to increase. I trust that you will thus dispel as far as possible any impression in the King’s mind that, m now putting forward proposals much more favourable to him than the two territorial concessions already offered, His Majesty’s Government would be likely to yield still furthfei in response to continued bargaining on his part. As you are aware, this is a point to which the India Office attach much importance. You should explain that the new’ boundary which you are about to offer has been carefully wor ’ out and that, while'the geographical, historical and political considerations mentioned in the preceding paragraphs have naturally been taken into full consideration the new proposals also take account of the full and detailed mfor- mation which His Majesty’s Government have now received from thmr local authorities in Arabia regarding the wanderings and habitats of the Ahl Mmra tribe In the light of this information His Majesty s Government are prepared to a-ree in principle to recognise King Abdul Aziz’s claim to the allegiance of the \hl Murra tribe, and they have endeavoured to align their proposed boundary so as to include as far as possible within Saudi Arabia the grazing grounds (“ dira”) exclusively or predominantly utilised by the various nomadic sections 14 As you are aware, the Political Agent at Koweit has recently reported that the Murra ‘‘ dira ” appears to be bounded on the north, east and south by a hne running from a point south of Hofuf parallel to but inland from the neck o the Qatar Peninsula; continuing in a south-easterly direction along the southern edo-e of the Sabkhat Matti marsh ; turning south-south-east at the south-eastern corner of the Sabkhat Matti; running thence straight across the Eastern Rub -al- Khali as far as the Sabkhat Mijora (approximately at the intersection of meridian VP E and parallel 20° N.); and thence sweeping westwards, within the southern limit of the Great Sands, so as just to include the important group of wells atShanna : I enclose herein a copy of a valuable sketch map prepared by Colonel Dickson to illustrate the result of his recent enquiries^ 1 ) 15. You are authorised to make such use as you think best of this infor mation; but you should be careful not to give the impression that His Majesty’s Government have in any way abandoned their objections, as explained to Fuad ^^Bey Hamza in London, to basing the frontier solely on tribal considerations. To do so might only encourage the belief that His Majesty's Government would be prepared to modify their offer in the light of further statements regarding tribal settlements or “ diras,” and might lead the Saudi Government to embark on a lengthy, and inevitably fruitless, argument as to the precise areas covered by tribal migrations. At the same time, you should make the best possible use of the fact that, in their new proposals, His Majesty's Government are offering to recognise the sovereignty of King Abdul Aziz over practically the whole “ dira of the Ahl Murra tribe, even as defined by the information communicated by Fuad Bey Hamza at the time of the conversations in London. 16. After these preliminary observations you should, subject to confirmation by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf of the exact location of key-points A and B mentioned in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) below, and to further tele graphic instructions in regard to the eastern sector of the frontier dealt with in sub-paragraph (c) below, make a formal offer of the following line as the boundary between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on the one hand and the Sheikhdoms of Qatar and Abu Dhabi (in special relations with His Majesty’s Government), the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, and the Aden Protectorate, on the other :— (a) A line starting from a point on the eastern shore of the gulf known as the Dohat-as-Salwa about 4 miles to the north-east of the settlement of Qasr-as-Salwa, running thence in a straight line to a point, which may for convenience of reference be called “ Key-point A,” which will probably lie at the western extremity of the salt lake known as Sabkhat-al-Amra. (b) From this point the line will run roughly due south to a point to be known as “ Key-point B.” This point, when fixed, will be situated approxi mately on the northern boundary of the Murra “ dira) *' as drawn in the light of the latest information in the possession of His Majesty’s Government (i.e., on Colonel Dickson’s map (see paragraph 14 above)). It is proposed to fix this key-point B at some well on the southern edge of the district known as A1 Aqal (i.e., a short distance east of the intersection of meridian 51 c E. with parallel 24 N.) to which a positive claim can be advanced on behalf of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. The Political Resident is still making enquiries as to the precise points at which these two key-points A and B could reasonably and properly be fixed, and further instructions will be sent to you as soon as his reports have been received and a decision has been reached by His Majesty’s Government thereon. (c) From key-point B it is proposed that the boundary should proceed, generally speaking, in a straight line, but so as to leave the whole of the Sabkhat Matti to Abu Dhabi to the intersection of parallel 22° N. with meridian 54° or 55° E. and thence down whichever of those meridians is decided on to its intersection with parallel 20 c N. The Political Resident is being consulted on the question of substituting meridian 55° E. for meridian 54° E., as originally proposed, for this sector of the line, and further instructions will be sent to you on this point as soon as possible. (d) Thence the boundary will run in an approximately straight line, but so as to leave the Sabkhat Mijora in Saudi Arabia and the Rarnlat Mugshin in Muscat and Oman, to the intersection of meridian 52 c E. and°parallel 19° N. (namely the south-eastern corner of the area— the so-called “ brown line ” concession—offered to Fuad Bey Hamza in London last July), and thence in a straight line to the intersection of parallel 18° N. with the “violet line” of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914. (qNot reproduced.17. Your detailed comments on the proposed line, which you may make at whatever stage seems to you most appropriate, should be based on the following considerations : You should make what capital you can out of the small further concession which the new line offers at its northern end, in that it lies considerably east of the so-called “ green line ” which you were instructed to offer to the Saudi Government last April. You should emphasise that, as a result ^ of their further thorough study of the matter. His Majesty’s Government are now prepared fully to admit the Saudi claim to the wells at Banaiyan, to which Fuad Bey attached such particular importance last summer. You should also lay stress on the fact that the sector of the line defined in sub-paragraph (b) of the preceding paragraph represents a genuine attempt to meet the Saudi claim while respecting the territory of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. You will then do your best to make it clear, while not letting it be thought that the line is drawn on a purely tribal basis, that the line now proposed leaves within Saudi Arabia the whole of the Murra dira ” according to the latest information in the possession of His Majesty’s Government (see paragraph 14 above). Moreover, in carrying the boundary as far east as they are now doing. His Majesty’s Government will be recognising the authority of King Abdul Aziz as extending beyond the “ dira ” of the Murra tribe into the southern part of that of the Manasir, who are a tribe predominantly based on territory under the sovereignty of Abu Dhabi. You may then point out that the southern section of the proposed line, described in sub-paragraph (d) of the preceding paragraph, leaves not only the whole of the Murra 1 k dira ’ in this region within Saudi territory, but also the important wells at Shanna, although these are used by tribes from the Aden Protectorate almost as much as by the Ahl Murra. In conclusion, it will be well for you to explain that, although the proposed boundary, like that proposed by King Abdul Aziz himself, is in its eastern and southern sections necessarily artificial, and based mainly on geographical co-ordinates, His Majesty’s Government are satisfied that it represents a fair and reasonable division between the various suzerainties concerned. 18. Lastly, you should make every endeavour to ensure that in any settle ment eventually reached all tribes are left free to use their normal wells and grazing grounds on whichever side of the line they may be situated. 19. Basing yourself on the broad lines of the instructions contained in the preceding paragraphs. I request that you will make every effort to secure the acceptance in 'principle by King Abdul Aziz of the new boundary proposed by His Majesty’s Government. In the event of agreement being reached, they are still inclined to favour the procedure suggested in paragraph 8 of Sir J. Simon’s telegram No. 70 of the 1st May, namely, the incorporation of the new line in a single comprehensive instrument in which the frontier would be defined as being between Saudi Arabia on the one hand and Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Muscat and the Aden Protectorate on the other. This point is, however, premature at the present time, as is also the question of the possible final demarcation of the frontier in the vicinity of the Qatar peninsula. I am, &amp;c. SAMUEL HOARE.mam / V 1 P.Z. 8115/35. Secret. Cypher Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Political Resident in the Persian Gulf;^ repeated to Government of India and Political contained in Loch’s telegram 4 th November, IT0.15C, and your telegram 7th November, Uo.932. offered to Ibn Baud should leave the coast about 4 miles north-east of point on the coast nearest Q,asr Salwa and proceed for about 10 miles in a south-easterly direction to a point ”A' at which it would turn in a more southerly direction to a point ’’B” about halfway betv/een Haluwain and ITakhala. Line from A to B would be so drawn as to leave (1) the Lohah route west of Sabkhat al Amra with the following places to Abu Dhabi, vi z . , Khafuz, Rimth, Farhud, Aqalat-al-Manasir and ITakhala, and (2) Raghuwan and Haluwain to Ibn Baud. From point B line would proceed to point !i C n at intersection of meridian 52° and parallel 23° so as to leave to Abu Dhabi Mijan, Sabkhat Matti and Sufuk. 3. From point C there are two alternatives:- (a) to intersection of meridian 55° and parallel 22° and thence along that meridian to its intersection with parallel 20°; (b) (l) to a point ’’D” at intersection of meridian 54° 40' and parallel 22° 40’, (2) thence to a point ”E' at intersection of meridian 55° 40’ and parallel 22°, and Immediate. 3645. I am much obliged by appreciations 2. H.M.G. have decided that line now to be£ 2 . (3) thence to intersection of meridian 55° and parallel 20°. The object of the second alternative would be to approximate as closely as possible, in one sector of the line at least, to the line suggested by Ibn Saud himself - provided that this can be done without sacrificing the interests of our proteges - and thus to facilitate Sir A. Ryan’s task in reaching an agreement at Riyadh. 4. In either case southern sector would run from last-mentioned point in an approximately straight line to intersection of meridian 52° and parallel 19° (but so as to leave Sabkhat Mijora to Ibn Saud and Ramlat Mugshin to Muscat) and thence in a straight line to intersection of parallel 18° with the Violet Line of Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914 which marks north-west boundary of Aden Protectorate. 5. Since it is contemplated that any line now agreed on with Ibn Saud should be described in treaty to be subsequently concluded as frontier between territories of Ibn Saud on the one side and Muscat (among others) on the other side, and it is desirable not to give Sultan of Muscat any cause to complain that he has been confronted with a fait accompli , it is considered necessary that, if possible before Ryan opens his negotiations at Riyadh, Sultan should be informed that it is proposed to endeavour to negotiate a treaty with Ibn Saud which would determine the Muscat-Saudi frontier. In making this communication to the Sultan, Political Agent should explain that negotiations cover the whole question of south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia and are part of wider negotiations by which it is hoped to consolidate the cordial relations subsisting between H.M.G. and Ibn Saud,but that as parts of the frontiers to be negotiated are of interest to Muscat, H.M.Ct. desire at this stage to inform Sultan of the position. Ibn Saud has advanced claims to a wide area in south-eastern Arabia extending, for example, to meridian 5S C between parallels 22 and 19 and to a line from the intersection of meridian 56° and parallel 19° to the intersection of meridian 52° and parallel 17°. H.M.9. are not prepared to recognise the whole of these claims, which in the south certainly would encroach on territory which they recognise as appertaining to the Sultan. however, see no objection to recognising Ibn Saud’s claim to an area in the Great Sands extending eastward at any rate as far as meridian 55° between parallels 22° and 20° and in the south to a line drawn from the latter intersection to the intersection of meridian 52° and parallel 19°. These are the sectors of the proposed frontier with which Muscat would be concerned. 6. Watts should then ask Sultan what he regards as the western boundary of his own dominions, and should ascertain from him whether it would encroach on territory to which Muscat has a supportable claim or would adversely affect an 2 /Muscat interests if offer now to be made to Ibn Saud were to include the small additional area covered by sectors (2) and (3) in alternative (b) in paragraph 3 above. 7. Please instruct Watts to approach Sultan at once on lines indicated in paras. 5 and 6 above. Matter is very urgent as it is desired if possible to give Ryan definite instructions as between alternatives in para.3 before he leaves Bahrein for Riyadh on 20th November.4. This will mean that reply should he received here, if at all possible, by 17th November. 8. With reference to paras.1 (4) and 3 of Loch’s telegram No.150 and para.3 cf your telegram No.932, H.M.G. do not feel that case is sufficiently strong for allotting the southerly places mentioned to Abu Dhabi and have consequently decided that any rate alternative (a) in para. 3 above can be offered to Ibn Saud. This being the case, please telegraph your views as t o whether any Abu Dhabi interest would be adversely affected by slightly increasing the offer so as to include area covered by sector (1) of alternative (b). 9. Please arrange to communicate a copy of this telegram and, if possible, of your reply to Sir A.Ryan at Koweit or Bahrein.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002a3_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2137</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002a3</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2137</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 6/67(4) 'Boundaries of South Eastern Arabia and Qatar.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1935/1937</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-05-22T11:30:05</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (420 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 421; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
