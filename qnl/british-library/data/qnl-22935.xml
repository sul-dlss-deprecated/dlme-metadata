I said that, so far as I was concerned the matte* did not affect me as I should I hoped be on le.ve, but that I thought that the principle of by whom the reception was to be held should be settled between you and him, before anything was made public.

There should w a fcuecial saat for the Shaikh ana his brothers and sons at some place towards the middle of the Garden. (d) It wixl not be possible to sen t everybody. So I tnink tnat apart from a number of chairs for the Shaikh and Iris party we had better be content with putting the bdanee of the tennis chairs in snail groups/-groups here end there t nd f; ce the feet thet awst people vrill have to walk ebout# (e) The question of serving drinks will be l difficult one* We oust in the first place get large quantities of ice so that there #111 be no question of iuiy one getting hot drinks. With the consider, bie numbers of guests it will be very difficult to serve arinks quickly and I think te shall have to borrow servants from outside though it is a pivctice of which I disapprove. I would suggest the /idviser’s, Steele's, SkriHtshlre 1 s and Skinner's men. (f) It will be wise to put &amp; special person in charge of alcoholic drirucs i*nd cigarettes, other- wise tney will be apt to uisappear. He should have orders to hand them out only to specific people, possibly to the butler and one other who will then distribute them to other serv nts but will h*ve some small cm ok on the consumption. (g) His Hlghnes. will no do.ut leave before prayer time and I think that the majority if not all the ;r:;bs, Indians and Iranians will go to prayer end probebiy will tnen not return. At about id.20 hours the Sloop which will be anchored at the Sloop An chorage of -anamah will turn her search lights on to the Agency. This will be a signal that in a few minutes she will fire a bunch of rockets and the guests will then be invited to come to the sea wail to see the rockets urn will then probably take their leave.

(i) Cloak room arrangements will be necessary* X triink that the best thing is to use the pergola at the cast end of the Garden in a corner of which suitable arrangements can be made. P screen end light end a notice should be arranged. There should be e ladies* cloak room in the Agenoy itself and it would be well to get s lady (perhaps &amp;rs.

The Political /gent and the Assistant Political Agent will be in ciess dress ^hot weather). I nave offered to bring out the guests on board the 'Fetix Jones' leaving the Agency pier (high tide is 2005 hours) at 21.15 hours. The fcenior Naval officer will have a wotor boct «fc the pier also to bring on stragglers.

I mentioned these matters in order to emphasise that it was not merely a question of light-hearted issue of invitations for which we had been asked for a list of names. The matter will be discussed when the Political Resident is here. 3-4-37 / Resubmitted vide P.A's Note dated 3-4-37 above pi.
