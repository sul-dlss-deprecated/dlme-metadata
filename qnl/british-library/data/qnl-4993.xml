His Majesty’s Government arc convinced that the Byrian Government will agree that this is a fair and reasonable solution of the difficulty and will allow the cases to be settled with the minimum of delay and in the gener?ii interest. 3* As regards the juridical position of British subjects in Syria in the future, His Majesty's Government In the United Kingdom recognise that they will naturally com© within the full jurisdiction of the Rational Courts* At the same time His Majesty’s Government are confident that the Byrtan Govenament will be prepared to adopt, with regard to their rjereonal status, the rule which is adopted in the majority of countries, namely that *heir national law should be applied to them. It is true that, in the /United The Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Damascus•I United Kingdom and nearly all other British territories for which *ll3 ^a^esty* s OoverRment In + he TTnited Kingdom are reeponsihlet it is the law of the domicile rather than the law of the nationality which le applied for personal status caaee. But the expression ^domicile 1 * in English law hrs a very special reading and is quite distinct from the conception of residence. 'Domicile' refers to the place which is deemed to he a man's permanent h m© as opposed to the reeideiice which he may establish for even quite a long period elsewhere. Further, every person acquires at hi© birth as hla domicile of origin the domicile of hie jarente a d the English courts require such strict proof that the domicile of origin has been replaced by a new domicile of choice that it is comparatively rarely that they find that the domicile of origin has been so displaced. Consequently in fact the result is that, in the vast majority of cases, a Syrian national in the United Kingdom and the British territories referred to above will in fact be held to be domiciled in Syria and therefore in natters of personal status Syrian law would be applied to him by the courts. Acceptance of this principle would mean that with regax*d to all quest ions concerning marriage and conjugal rights, divorce, judicial separation, dowry, \ paterni y, affiliation, legitimation, adoption, capacity of persons, majority, guardianship, trusteeship and interdiction, succession by will or on Intestacy, distribution of estates, and settlements, and in general family law, British Subjects in Syria would be subject to their national laws, and if with respect to any of the said questions one of the parties should bring a matter before the Syrian Courts, th© said Courts would have to apply the appropriate British laws. The competent British authorities will, of course, furnish to the Syrian Government, in case of need, the necessary information relative to such British laws. 4* His 1 ajoaty's Legation hope that the ministry will be able to communicate to them at an early date the consent of the Syrian Government to a practical solution of these outstanding juridical problems on the above lines. His Majesty's Legation avail themselves of this opportunity to renew to the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs the assurance of their highest consideration.COPY ( F* 11490/491/^9 ) V; - r^s fTTOATT RKJ tTBLIC if rtmrt op porkiwt appairj. »o. 1CH/3.

His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom fully appreciate the desire of the Syrian Government to settle as soon as possible all the pending cases which had been begun before the Mixed Courts in May, 1945, and which have since been suspended, and at the same time they understand the point of view of the Syrian Government which is clearly set out in the Ministry’s Note under reply that,-in the future, the administration of justice should be entrusted exclusively to magistrates of Syrian natignality. For these reasons, while not receding from the contention which they have alv/ays maintained that, on the abolition of the Mixed Courts, the Capitulatory Jurisdiction of British Consular Courts would in strict theory automatically revive until surrendered in a further agreement to be mado between the two Governments, they note that the Syrian Government are not in agreement v/ith this theory and, far from pressing their point of view, they are prepared to join with the Syrian Government in finding a practical and final solution6833 - 2 - which v/ill give the fullest re i co^ftit4on te~4^ independence of the Syrian judicature. His Majesty 1 s Government have accordingly decided to withdraw the request made in the Legation’s Note No. 85 of the 30th March 1936 ? for the appointment of neutral judges to terminate the cases pending 'before the Mixed Courts^ and to suggest instead that these cases should he heard in the Syrian National Courts hut that the judges before whom they would he argued, in all degrees of jurisdiction, should he Syrian magistrates who have had experience in the Mixed Courts and who will therefore he able finally to dispose of the cases on the basis of the existing pleadings and the interlocutory decisions already made, without the necessity of having them translated, thus ensuring continuity of procedure and jurisprudence. His Majesty’s Government are convinced that the Syrian Government will agree that this is a fair and reasonable solution of the difficulty and will allow the cases to he settled v/ith the minimum of delay and in the general interest. As regards the juridical position of British Subjects in Syria in the future, His Majesty’s Government in the U.K, recognise that they will naturally come within the full jurisdiction of the National Coarts. At the same time His Majesty’s Government are confident that the Syrian Government will he prepared to adopt, wi'th regard to their personal status, the rule which is adopted in the majority of countries, namely that their national law should he applied to them. It is true that, in /the7 1 EAT 1 6839 qr Bri tories for -3- the U.K. and nearly all othqr Briti^f;terri which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are responsible, it is the law of the domicile rather than the law of the nationality which is applied for personal status cases. But the expression ’'domicile” in English lav; has a very special meaning and is quite distinct from the conception of residence, 'Domicile” refers to the place which is deemed to he a man’s permanent home as opposed to the residence which he may establish for even quite a long period elsewhere. Further, every person acquires at his birth as his domicile of origin the domicile of his parents and the English courts require such strict proof that the domicile of origin has been replaced by a new domicile of choice that it is comparatively rarely that they find that the domicile of origin has been so displaced. Consequently in fact the result is that, in the vast majority of cases, a Syrian national in this country will in fact be held to be domiciled in Syria and therefore in matters of personal status Syrian law would oe applied to him by the courts of this country. Acceptance of this principle would mean that with regard to all questions concerning marriage and conjugal rights, divorce, judicial separation, dowry, paternity, affiliation, legitimation, adoption, capacity of persons, majority, guardianship, trusteeship and interdiction, succession by will or on intestacy, distribution of estates, and settlements, and in general family law, British Subjects in Syria would be /subject-4~ 6833 I 4 R ; subject to thoir national laws, and if with respect to any of the said questions one of the parties should bring a matter before the Syrian Courts, the said Courts would have to apply the appropriate British lav/s. The competent British authorities will, of course, furnish to the Syrian Government, in case of need, the necessary information relative to such British laws, 4, His Majesty’s Legation hope that the Ministry will be able to communicate to them at an early date the consent of the Syrian Government to a practical solution of these outstanding juridical problems on the above lines.

The Syrian Government, in the general interest and in order to avoid all unnecessary delay and expense in the final decision of the cases pending before the .ixed Courts, are prepared, as an exceptional and temporary measure, to accept the suggestion contained in the Legation’s Note for their prompt disposal before! Syrian magistrates with experience in the Mixed Courts* 3« As regards the personal status of British subjects in Syria, the Syrian Government are jj/x v.pa* ctx uu auopx me principle which is already admitted by the Syrian courts and which is considered at a Principle of international law recognised by the courts of the majority of countries, of the application in such matters of the national law of the person concerned. The Syrian Government have taken note of the statement of the position in Kngland under Snglish law as set out in the Legation’s note, according to which in fact in the majority of cases in Kngland the national Syrian law will be applied to determine questions of personal statue concerning Syrian nationals owing to the special nature of the conception of the domicile as developed in the jurisprudence of the English courts.

The main ot acts of the French at the meeting held at the State Department s vhich Wadsworth also attend ed k v;ere tc find out how far His Majesty’s Government had got in their negotiations with Syria and how far United States had progressed with Syria and Lebanon. Wadsworth dealt with the second point (paragraph 2 of my telegram No. 5728). The French had evidently thought matters were \ much further for v; ard. 2, The main French fears are (a) that although the Lebanese have not as yet shown signs of Wishing to abolish the mixed Courts, they v/ill probably do so once an agreement with Syria is signed and (b) that no guarantees for ensuring the efficient and impartial dispensation of justice appears to be includedEXT 6666 included in His Majesty’s Government’s agreement with Syria, 3. On the first point, the French are attached to a system of mixed courts in the Lebanon which have, they feel, worked well. The State Department had foreseen a gradual elimination of mixed courts in the Lebanon and of the use of the French language, except perhaps for important cases involving precedents. They agree however that the Lebanese will watch the position in Syria closely. On second point the French are doubtful of the efficiency of Syrian courts, their judges being less well trained than the Lebanese, Informed Wadsworth is inclined to agree. The French accordingly ask whether we propose to accept the jurisdiction of the Syrian Courts in cases other than those of personal status without seeking to safeguard ourselves by specific guarantees or by a separate agreement, I assumed after seeing His Majesty’s Government’s draft note that this is so, but would be grateful for confirmation, L. French would have preferred an intermediate regime on the lines of the Montreux Convention, but Wadsworth pointed out that Syria was now an independent State and would be unlikely to agree. When asked what exactly they would propose in these circumstances, the French'ext 6666 • ' . _ ^ . J -3- French hinted that they would have preferred the three Governments to exercise gentle pressure on the Syrian Government for some guarantee that justice would be efficiently and impartially applied - an echo of their desire for tripartite action. But as they concluded that negotiations had already gone too far between His Majesty's Government and Syria for this to be worth discussing in Washington, they propose to refer the matter back to Paris in case the French Government wish to make any further representations in Paris or London. I have emphasised to them that His Majesty's Government wished to conclude the agreement with Syria at earliest possible moment. They were also told that His Majesty’s Legation in Beirut would go over the text of the agreement with the French Minister there before taking action. 5. Both the State Department and French representatives asked if they might be given copies of notes which we propose to exchange and which I have received to-day. May I do this?
