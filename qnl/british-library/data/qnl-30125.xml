Signed this 1st day of October, 1945. By The landing contractors. # By The Director General of Customs, Muscat.The steamer arrived here on the 1-10-45 in the evening no arrangement for landing were made in the evening by the B- 1-Agent On the 2-10-45 work was commenced on the ship at 9 A.M un loading was done from all 3 hatches up to 3 P-M- when hatch No* 1 was closed the other two hatches worked up to 9 P«M« when the B«I» coolies refused £o work 4900 bags were unloaded* On the 3-10-45 work commenced at 9 A-M. all the three hatches worked up to noon when cargo in No* 1 completely taken out* the other two hatches No* 2 &amp; 3 continued to work up to 8 P-M* when the ship started taking over cargo for India. 4300 bags were un loaded- ^ On 4-10-45- work commenced at 8 A.M. The two hatches worked throughout up to 7 P*M. after which ship took the cargo for India* 3560 bags were un loaded. On 5-10-45 work commenced at 8 A.M* there was only one hatch left which worked whole day &amp; unloaded 1466 bags only* The slings working large sise bags of barley take long time to unload as the B*I* coolies were unable to feed the slings promptly. on 6-10-45 work commenced at 10 A.M. Only one hatch is working in which the remaining barley is stored* The landing contractors have sixteen boats available but the unloading being slow as explained above no blame appears to lie f$ on the lendlrg contractor* The steamer is also loading cargo at the same time it is unloading and therefore the unloading has taken longer than it would have taken if the unloading was completed before the loading was started. Moreover the cargo for unloading was not equally distributed in the three hatches as will be seen from the details ofxxBkncriAnf unloading given above- Amin. 6.10*1945*S.S. ,, Barjora M arrived in Muscat on Monday the 1st of October and is not expected to sail before Monday the 8th of October. The cargo to be off-loaded from and loaded on to the ship amounted to some 1500 tons which means to say that approximately 200 tons per day have been handled while she has been in the port. I have discussed the reasons for this slow progress with the Arent of Gray, Mackenzie 8c Co., and it appears that the reasons are as follows: (1) Unloading from lighters for dhows at Customs premises is impossible at low tide. (2) The S.S. ’’Barjora” arrived at Muscat at 4 P*ni. on the 1st but no boats came alongside until morning of the 2nd. (3) Labour shortage due to the fact that aporoximately 900 coolies are now en-route to Masirah and the present draft •at Mas?rah has not yet returned. (4) Coolies at the Customs shed do not work up to the contract time of mid night with the result that dhows and lighters lie off customs premises for long periods during the hours of darkness when no work is performed. (5) The behaviour of boatmen engaged on unloading is un satisfactory^ as they are under-paid whereas merchants for the hire of dhows at the rate of 20 baizas per package.Only 4 baizas are paid for off-loading. (6) The Contractor has no one to supervise the responsibilities ► carried out by his Agents under contract.

Cargo for Muscat was unevenly loaded, 700 out of 1208 tons being in one tsc hatch. (2) Ship arrived at 4 p.m. on 1st No lighters appeared until 9 a.m. on 2nd. (This was taken up with Sultan). (3) Working of hatches is responsibility of P.I. Agents. Agents' coolies struck Y/ork on 2nd. complaining that no arrangements had been made for feeding. (4) Owing to infrequency of shipping stevedoring now offers tio livelihood to coolies who prefer to seek employment elsewhere. Result is inexperienced and undisciplined labour of poor quality. (5) Labour shortage at that time was acute. 900 men had been engaged for Masirah and previous draft of over 1000 had not returned. (6) Captain informed me that apart from (2) he had no complaint against landing contractor for lack of lighters. Landing contract provides however that lighters for off-loading should work upto 12 midnight only. This po'nt was also taken up with Sultan at time but is not yet settled.

'Barjora’ 1 has been unnecessarily delayed at Muscat. On the first occasion, this ship arrived at 4 p.m. on the 1st. October and no lighters came alongside until 9 a.m. the following morning. On the second occasion, the 3.S.'Earjora' arrived at Muscat on the 2oth November at approximately the same time and only one lighter came oi^t to the ship between the time of her arrival and daylight of the following morning. On this occasion, the ship was further delayed on the 29th of November owing to the inability of the Landing Contractor to provide lighters to work the ship after 8.45 p.m. local time. It may be noted here that Landing Contract provides that work shall continue up to 12.00 midnight. The Sultan promised to look into the matter and to try and arrange with the landing Contractor for the un loading of ships to. continue throughout the night. 10-12-1945. /«' -L XL, -A ^ ■ •'' PL 0^ K 1 ‘ (1. . 4c i \TO GRAY, MACKENZIE &amp; CO.

Yours faithfully. Sd/- XXXX Per Pro. Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co. Agents.During low tiaea ws ai'c experienc ing lot of difficulties for unloading general cargo ianaed ex otearners. Due to this our request to the Direct r General of Customs xor either extention of the *\ Customs jetty or building of a god own to store general cargo,is being dealt with since long. ’.lien iW'. N. i-lacleod of Mackinuons Bombay came here during December 1S45 ^/e showed him our difficulties ana he ' iscussed the points with K.B. llaqbul Hussein. When LSr. ^nderson ana ia*. Shuntei caaie here in January last tne Director General of Customs told them that it is the desire of iluscat Government to improve the imports of Muscat and then also the port facalitias were discusseu .and the importance of the extention of Customs jetty, to amble cargo lighters to come alongside during low tides to off loid cargo, or of a godown at Khor jetty, which will enaoie off loading during low tides at Customs, was explained. Since then Bombay Agents insisting of this facility and it is essential that a godown at &amp;hor should Dfe to store c^rgo when necessary during _ow tides to facilitate the cargo boats return back soon to the ship to receive further cargo. Uur 1-st letter in this connection to the Director General of Customs is Ho.BI/P/40 of 12.ci.i7. to which we still await a reply.gt6S4 - 13/3 Political Agency, Muscat. 13th Decenter 1947* you please refer to the enolomxre to your endorsenent No* C./162 dated the 9th Oeoer^ber 1947 on the subject of the unloading facilities at Uusoat* 2* So^jo nonths ago, in June to be exact, the Captain of the 'Duara* complained to me about delays in unloading of cargo at Muscat due to the fact that the cargo barges oannot go alongside the Customs eharf at low tida* He said that Mackinnon Maokensie had oomplainad about this for some tins, but that no attantlon had been paid to thair complaints. I mas aoraavhat surprisad as I have not hitherto come across any correspondence on iqy files on this subject* I agreed, however, to look into the matter* On sy return I made enquiries, as a result of which it transpires that there had indeed been correspondence on this subject exchanged between fecklnnon Mackenzie and the Agent of Qimy iteeicensie in Muscat* The Agent olaiias that he had made representations to the Stata without sueeassf he had not, however, at any time asked for the assistance of tha Consulate in this matter* 3* It is dear that an expensive extension to the Customs wharf could not be made without the sanction of tha Sultan* While agreeing therefore to raise the matter with the Muscat Government at the earliest possible opportunity, I told the Agent of Gray Jlfcokensle and the Captain of the 'Duarn* on his return voyage, that nothing could be done until the Sultan* s return from Ehoffcr* As an alternative to the extension of the Customs wharf, the Captain of the *Dumra H was of the opinion that tha difficulty might be overcome if cargo ma discharged at 2fetrah instead of ‘rusent* This, while creating no special difficulty or expanse would / entail Tha Honourable Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E*, C.S*I., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain* —11 ■— f*—^ -— - 2 - entail the transfer of a large part of the CustoTtis Staff from Jfuscat uo fetrah, a step which the Director General of Cuatoras irtiile agreeing nay be a practical proposition, feels he cannot take until he has referred the natter to the Sultan on his return fron Dh©far. Thus the natter stands. In point of actual fact however whether the wharf is extended or not, or whether the Customs are transferred from .'Jusoat to FJatrah or not, I sincerely believe that due to the fact that in Muscat, the Doctor and barges are invariably waiting for tha ship, the B.I. mail steamers exparience less delay in Muscat than in ary other nort in tr e Persian Gulf. Indeed, during the course of conversation with different Captains of the nail steamers, they have admitted this. The exception is the Captain of the 'Dumra 1 *, Captain Rainer. While socially a pleasant and delightful person, I believe this Captain to be extremely difficult to work with. He is, as is natural^ invanuhly anxious to get away from Port at the appointed time, whether or not he has completed the loading or discharging. Owing to circumstances which are no doubt beyond his control he is unfortunately not always able tc arri/e o r . time* If, therefore, he arrives an hour or two hours late and insists on leaving according to his original programme, it is not altogether surprising that the shore people are not always able to sake up this lost time. From the point of view of the shore, it is held that the fault lies with the Captain, who has given less time than was scheduled in the progrannie for the organisation of the loading and discharging, jhe Captain, however does not invariably appreciate the difficulties of our organising the barge turn over to as to fit the programme into a leaser number of houra, and in conaequenca if the discharge has not been completed, ia inclined to blame the shore people. I wish in no way to make a complaint about the Captain, whose sole purpose I am sure is to perform his duties in the beat intarest of hie Company. I do feel, hwwever, that Captain Rainer not infrequently / showsA I - 3 - ahowB a lack of ayrapatliy and understanding of the Agent's difficulties which mislead him into the belief that delays in the handling of cargo are solely and entirely the fault of the shore people* I believe that this feeling is shared by others in other Pernlan Gulf ports* 4« Almost as important as a regular call to lift cargo is a regular delivery of mails, and passenger service and I would earnestly request that it may be impressed on Hacklnnon and ftfcekensle that even though the 'Da 1 * are not able to spare time to ship heavy and large cargoes they should stop at Muscat for the hour or hour and a half which would be sufficient to pick up and land passengers and mail. £ £ I** ^ S C/C*. i f\&lt; C' £('6(r,— 3/96 '‘ .fctide Memoir rt I told tlie Sultan of the B.I.S.K.
