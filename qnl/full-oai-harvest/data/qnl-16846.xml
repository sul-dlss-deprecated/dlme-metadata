In response, it reports that due to the efforts of ships belonging to the Imam of Muscat, Said bin Sultan, the level of piracy in the Gulf is very low, but it is noted that William Bruce expects the level of piracy to increase once these ships are reassigned to other duties.Also noted is the presence of boats in the Gulf led by Shaik Dervish, brother to Shaik Abdel Russool Khan [Shaikh ‘Abd al-Rasūl Khān], former Governor of Bushire (deposed in 1808). It explains that these boats are attacking any boats belonging to Bushire and murdering any Persian crew members they find.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023685574.0x000048#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
