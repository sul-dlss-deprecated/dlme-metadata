His Majesty's Consul at Ahwas was accordingly instructed to arrange for the administration of the estate to he handed over to the Iranian Courts. It was realised that this procedure would not be in the Interest of the creditors, but account was taken of the fact that they were mainly non-British subjects, and it was considered unwise to adopt in their interests a course which would Involve His Majesty's Vloe-Consul in action Illegal under international and Iranian law. go far, therefore, as the arguments advanced in paragraph 3 of Mr. Consul watkinson's despatch of the 14th February are The Right Honourable Anthony Kden, M.C., M.P., etc., etc., eto. /concerned The Foreign Office.concerned, there would not appeer to he any grounds for reeoneidering the instruotlona contained in Sir Samuel Hoare'a despatch under reference. In paragraph 2, however, of his despatch, iff• Watklnson suggests that the course of handing over the estate to the Iranian authorities night Involve him or His Majesty's Vice-Consul at Xhorramshahr not In Illegal aotion but in most awkward discussions with these authorities* I share to the full Mr, yatkinson's apprehensions on this point* I fear that it is only too likely that some nenber of the looal judicial administration night seek to make capital out of the opportunity afforded by a case in which a foreign eonsular authority has undoubtedly erred. It is clearly most undesirable that this should happen, and I venture therefore to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by paragraph 7 of sir Sanuel Hoare's despatch under reference to suggest tha£ further consideration should be given to the natter before action is taken on the instruotlons Issued to Mr, Vatklnson* 4, I think that the most correct alternative course of action would be to explain the whole story to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and to invite their assistance in finding a solution which would avoid the risk of awkward publicity and of coaplaints from the creditors* There is such to be said for this course and it is quite possible that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs would be syapathetie and helpful. On the other hand, past experience shows that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs are by no aeans always successful in imposing their views or wishes on other Departments, and it is doubtful whether they would in fact be able to prevent publicity if the creditors did raise objections or complain of the conduct of the case by His Majesty's Vice-Consul, I am therefore reluctant to adopt /thisthis course* Mr. Wstklnson suggests an alternative procedure, nasely that the oredltors should be held to be tlaeVberred from reoelvlng any further dividend, since no appllsation for payment has been made sines 1921. I do not Know whether this course would be legal under English law, but I am informed that it would in fact be correct under Iranian municipal law. An Iranian lawyer, to whom the Oriental Secretary to this Legation put the case in outline* without mentioning the precise facta or names, stated that the point in question would be covered by Article 219 of the Commercial Code* a French translation of which I have the honour to enclose. It will be seen that under this article the relevant period of prescription is five years. The lawyer consulted appeared to hold that the prescription applies to all bankruptcies, in the sense that the period of five years runs from the date of the bankruptcy» the receiver's duties are finished in five years, ! and no creditor can claim anything from the ebankrupt after the expiry of that period. If no ereditor applies for sny payment during five years from the date of bankruptcy, he loses oompletely the ehance of obtaining any share, and all sums paid in by the debtor and undistributed at the end of five years rsvert to the latter. Artiele 665, a copy of whleh is also enclosed, appears also to show that the period of preseription is five years, though it is trus that this article seems to apply only to the rehabilitation of bankrupts. 6. Thus undsr Iranian lav it would appsar that the creditors' claims ware already time-barred when the jurlsdletlon of British Consular Courts was aboilshad. If it would be compatible with English lav to take this 11ns thsrs is soma thing to bs said for ths course suggested byMr. Wutkinaon, namely that the eatate should be distributed to Indian charities* This would probably be the aoet effective way of burying the ease In decent oblivion. At the sane tiae there would sees to be serious objections to this course. If any of the creditors were subsequently to dlscorer» possibly froa the benkrupt himself, that further funds had become available but had never been distributed. It would be difficult to justify the action taken, and His Majesty's Vice-Consul might be open to attack both froa the bankrupt and from the creditors* It might be possible in that ease to recover the sum handed over to the Government of Indies but it seems more likely that the sum could not be recovered, since it would have been distributed and there would probably not be any fund which might be drawn upon to repay it. 7. I am therefore driven reInstantly to the conslualon that the best course is that for which provlalon la made under Iranian law, namely, to return the balance available to the bankrupt. Ha may not ba deserving, but nevertheless, if the creditors' claims are tlme^barred and the money available dose not belong to them, it would seem logical to say that it can only belong to the debtor. If the creditors were subsequently to raise objection to this course, I think s logical and even convincing defenee might be mads. Moreover, this course would not prevent Mr; Sequiers, if he is an honest men, froa distributing the available money himself among hia creditors. 8. I venture therefore to suggest for your consideration that, in the light of the observations eontaimec in the preceding paragraphs and in Mr. Vatklnson'a despatch, the instructions already issued to Mr. Vstklnson should be reconsidered, and that he should now be authorised to /arrangearrange for the return of the eua a tb liable to Mr. I am aandlng a copy of thle deapatch to HI* Majaaty’* Consul at Ahwas (n 0 * 8)* I hav* th* honour to b* with th* hlgh**t reapeot, ®lr § Your most obedlant. humble Servant f (Signed) Nevile Butler*No* 10. BRITISH CONSULATE, AH WAS, P^brunry 14th, 1936. Sir, #ith reference to your despatch Ho.36 of Septeaber 11 last, regarding the estate in banicruptoy of Mr. W # N. Be^ulera, I have the honour to request your further consideration of thia case before I taics action ae Lie true ted. 2 After further discussion with His iSnjesty's Vice Consul at Khorraaahahr, I am disinclined to hand over the money to the Iranian Government for the following reasons:- (1) I should at once lay myself open to a query as to why it was not handed over before, which I am unable to answer. (2) The Imperial B&amp;nfc of Iran might be Involved as an accessory for holding the money so long. (3) Explanations might have to be given by this Consulate or the Vice Consulate at Xhorramshahr to the local Court as to why no more was obtained from Mr. Sequeira. (4) Ho copy exiate of the original decision of the Consular Court declaring Ur. Sequeira a bankrupt. (6) The last payment by Mr. Sequelre was actually made to His Majesty 1 * Vico consul at Khorr&amp;m- shahr after he oeased to have jurisdiction in matters of bankruptcy and this fact would have to be Britannic Majesty's Charge d f Affaires, British Legation, Tehran.8 - coamunlcatad to the Iranian authorities If a full statement Is to be made. Pree.uaably the whole dossier would hare to be transferred to then before the Iranian Court could act. (6) The Vice Consul at Xhorranshahr .«j. . 1 . easily be involved In aay protests against the w: 5 oj.f procedure which creditors choce to make to the Iranian courts. (7) A long vista of direct correspondence wita creditors opens up. If, as Is highly probable, they fail to secure payment by the Iranian Courts. (8) This failure Is almost a foregone conclusion. 3. The unlikelihood of proper distribution by the nj. in ourtt* is not a matter on which I desire to lay 1.00 i&gt;ucn stress, i can only quote the analogy of their methods in dealing with the estates of deceased British subjects. Experience of the difficulties encountered by the beneficiaries of such estates or their legal representatives suggests that it would be sheer folly ko hand over the estate under consideration unless s definite agreement exists by which we must do so* With J '^ ut! r^upect i submit that there is no such agreement covering the present ease* 4, t&lt;*urther f it might be claimed by the Iranian authorities that the estate has theoretically been administered by the local Courts since the time when the Consular Court ceased to have jurisdiction, and that, as no olaia has been received by those Courts, payment is now time-barred, and the money therefore would accrue to the Iranian Treasury. 5. The last application made for payment was in fact received in 1921 and the last dividend was distributed in the same year. I consider therefore that payment should be held to be time-barred and the balance of money in hand treated as an unclaimed deposit. The creditors couldbe bo Informed, If necessary, though I can see no advantage in re-opening the quest ion with them after i x. I :&gt;ee oi time and many diaadvantatee. i venture to suggest that His Majesty*a Vine Consul at Khorram- ehfthr might properly be instructed by me, or by the oliourable the i ;&gt; olitical Resident under whose juris diction the affair was initiated, to remit this depooit to the Government of India for disposal, i believe that such moneys are used for charitable purposes.
