Political Resident, Persian Gulf, has reported that all four light lorries supplied to Muscat Levies In 1940 as part of War subsidy scheme have become unserviceable and has reco mmended their free replacement on grounds that stability of Muscat state Is bound up with Muscat Levies, that possibility of Internal disturbances for suppression of which His Majesty’s Government have given Jultan assurance of assistance Is always In the background, and that it Is to British advantage to assist In maintaining Muscat Levies at an efficient standard; on provision of lorries In 1940 transport system of Levies was changed over from animal (camel) to mechanised, and even partial reversion now would reduce their effectiveness. 3. In view of above considerations It Is obviously essential to replace old lorries and ittuM arrangements are being made to sun ply/, new vehi cles (2 lorries 3 ton 4x2 G.s. and two trucks 15 cwt. 4x4 G.S.) from military stocks In India. 4. aiestlon of payment for new vehicles remains to be settled.

It was therefore with the profoundest surprise that I read ^ your predecessor's note, and when 1 after a resume that ^ ] combined mislnformation with ignorance to a degree that I would not htive believed possible in so responsible an officer)! came to the passage 'I found it difficult at the moment to put forward any really valid arguments against your suggestions 4 1 felt that three centuries of effort on the part of India, the industry and enterprise of her merchants, the blood of her sepoys, the daring and resource of her ITavy, the foresight and courage of ^elly, :,obs and Cox and the lives of uhakespeare, bill, iUrdwood, Xorimer, Biscoe and Barrett were utterly wasted, 3, Row • w en after centuries of effort, of treasure / poured 0,K,Caroe Sequire, 0,1,i«, Z,C«b«, beoretary to the Government of Indi^, External ,*tffairs Department, Simla,poured out and patient trade, India ie juat entering upon her reward - it was proposed that this wast legacy which these men hare built up, this fabric which I and my colleagues austain, should be handed over for the sake of a few rupees to men whose interests are not our interests and who would wreck what they did not understand, it was found ^difficult to put forward any really strong arguments against the suggest!one &lt; *« There are at least four nations who would give their eyes to step into our shoes and would spend every cent they could spare to improve and maintain their position but we might «pay half the expenses of the post (the Kesident) so long as an Indian service officer filled It*” i 4 « blnce no reply to my predecessor^ note is on record I earn ot say what action was taken upon it nor what importance was attached to his views* Kore than three years have passed, ] however, and since India's interests have grestly Increased it may not be inappropriate to recapitulate the facts* I agree in the main with Sir Trenohard'e views, but would like to underline oert&amp;in points and expand others and drew atten tion to some fresh material which I hove collected. 5* I appreciate, of course, that it is the duty of the Finance .department to question all expenditure from time to time, and that if any is found to be no longer essential it muiut make way for more urgent ol&lt;*ix»s on the public purse* 1 do not wish to oast any aspersions upon the views expressed by Coates for they were made in good faith and it ie the duty of the technical departments to speak for themselves* One of his predecessors, Christie, once expressed the view to me that Indio had no concern In the Gulf* He very kindly spared me some time, and In half an hour 1 explained to him / exactly3- exAQtly what waa at stake and he was most interested. It will be convenient to have this information summarised and I attach an appendix in which it is clearly set out. 6. Sir Aubrey dealt (a) with Persia proper t and (b) with the Arab side of the Persian Gulf# As regards (a) the full \ papers are not available here# and it ie difficult to sty anything that would not be upset or amended by the conclusion the of^war, but I would be glad to be given an opportunity of expressing my views when the question arises again. The most practical solution appears to be that India should pay for her cwn Consulates plus a donation towards the cost of the legation. iSaoh side would then be free to employ the staff they considered necessary and pay them at the rate they deemed appropriate# much controversy would be avoided# and India could not be debited with unforeseen expenditure. 7. As regards (b) I have a great deal to say. The whole proposal is based on the false premise *that Indian interests on the Arab side of the Gulf have very greatly decreased in reoent years'. They have not . They have very largely increased# as T shall show by incontrovertible facts# and they will grow greater still in the very near future. Then# later# it is stated that 'Imperial interests have entirely submerged any Indian interest which used to exist*. This ie simply not the case, as bir Trenchard points out in his paragraph 4# why should the Air interest be more Imperial than Indian *t loea India send and receive no air mail ' Is it not vitally important that the ^oyal Air Force should be able to rush machines to her help from the Middle East# a reinforcement which becomes simpler arid more potentially / valuable V* valuable every day f a# regard* Oil, the Bahrain and California i\rablan Oil Coiapaniee are American oonoern* which compete with the roiglo*Iranian and ee 11 much of their oil to India, Where is the Imperial benefit here ? *helation« with Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran*# These are conducted through Jiddah, Jbagdad arid Tehran ae beiore, why ahould this affect Indian Interests t The xearl Trade, This, like all luxury trades has been under a shadow for some time, but is now enjoying a revival. It has not 'given place' to Oil as the two commodities are entirely unconnected, but the oil industry is a new-comer which provides lucrative employment for Indians, scope for Indian trade and raw material for the Indian market. 9, How I come to “the question of the Political Resident* 1 , and the doubt that the Toreign Office or Colonial Office would wish to retain him solely to supervise three *»Levantine Service Political Agents*, I scarcely know where to begin. In the first place I assume that the reference is to the levant Consular service (it is a mortal insult to call them levantinee) and if so, I may say that it was abolished several years ago, and that all officers joining the Consular Service have for some time been posted to the 'General*, and the *Par eastern*. The •Far ^astern* covers China, Japan and Siam and the Jutch Cast Indies, and the 'General * the rest of the world. The Gulf would, therefore, be staffed with officers who had quite possibly com# fresh from Curope or the United States (e,g, the last Consul at Basra), who were ignorant of its languages, and who would have only one object in view, namely, to get out of it again as quickly as possible. They might easily have no experience of the Saet, would certainly be utterly ignorant of / l m•5* any Indian vernacular, have no knowledge of and little eyrapathy for Indiana, and would be completely unveraed in the Indian oodea, lawa and adminiatrative experience required for tdtese parts* In fact, I cannot auggeet a surer and swifter method of sabotaging Indian (and British) interests in these parts than to hand over these Agencies to the Consular service# The very existence of the small Arab States and their Indian traders is threatened by Saudi Arabia, Tra&lt;l and Iran at every turn* Is it seriously suggested that Consular officers are likely to hazard their careers, during their brief flight through the Gulf, by countering the marked tendency of the foreign Office to sacrifloe the interests of the email States to the big ones ? 10* Sir Trtnoh&amp;rd, in his paragraph 6, disoue^ed the impossibility of employing Consular officers for this work* He omitted one point, which I mention with some hesitation* The consular Service, especially the 'General*, owing partly to its subordination to the Diplomatic Service, has been under a cloud for some years/and has had great difficulty in maintain* lug Its standard, and a number of the offioere recently posted to this part of the world have been of comparatively humble origin* Whatever their merits and their efficiency on paper, 1 do not think such officers would be suitable for dealing with independent rulers or large British and American oonmunltlea* 11 * Unless I am misinformed, the experience of India at the hands of the Colonial Office has not been very happy, and though they possess able men with some of the qualifications required, yet T am certain that it would be against India’s interests to transfer our control to them* I see nden past /mentioned• 6 - mentioncd in para^mpb 6 of air Tronciiard’a note* The Jolonial Offioe have recently extended their control along the eouthern shore* of Arabia and taken over the adainiatration of the Hadhr&amp;maut, which adjoins the diatant Kuecat province of diofar. The first and much hailed Rtaidant Adviser of this area was a Mr* Ingraffle, now appointed Chief Secretary at Aden* Taat year the Colonial Office paid hie wa^ to Ualaya and Java ao Uiat he might meet the Ar&amp;ba who i:u*4 emigrated there from the Kadhramaut* and* on hi a return, he wrote a a follows in the appendix to lukalla nummary $o*lil for the week ending 9th September 1939. '♦The i\xabe in Malaya and Java whom the Resident Adviser met muat have numbered several thousands ••* The pointe made in the various speeches (27 altogether) delivered by the Resident Adviser were: .** Hadhramaut for the Hadhramia* Vo foreignere to aettlc in the country, either Jews, Indiana or any other race'* | If the Colonial Office were to undertake the reaponelblli* | ty for the Gulf Kr.Ingrama might easily be the first Reaident, and there is no reason to suppose that the viewa which he expressed here over hi a own signature are not shared by his colleagues* 12* dir Trenohard dealt at some length with the question of whether the Foreign Office or Colonial Office would wish to retain a Political Resident solely to supervise •these t&amp;ree officers 11 * The doubt expressed here shows the stupendous ignorance that exists in India regarding the Gulf, the value of the work done in it and its importance to India* Hot merely the Political Resident, but the Political Agents have a greater responsibility and or independence and deal with wider issues than almost any of our posts in India* and it is a curious paradox th*t this should be much better appreciated in White hall, where the late lord Birkenhead, while Secretory of State / for x actually six*«7« for IndHa t once obacrred that he ooneidered the Gulf Reeidency more iMportaiit than at le&amp;st two Tndian lieutenant Govern or ehipi I cannot answer for the Foreign Office, but it is easy to gueee what the attitude of the Colonial Office would be froxn their action at ^den.

It is difficult to obtain statistics regarding Kuwait, but the prospects for India are expLremely bright as an enormous oil field has been discovered and the British Controlled Kuwait oil Company will certainly turn to India for labour and staff and a vast expansion of Indian interest will ensue.

New Delhi,the loth March 1937• n. My dear Coatee, I return herewith the file regarding the division of expenditure between India^aad His Majesty^ Government in Persia and the Persian Gulf. 1 gather from our conversation of this afternoon that your provisional views on the subject are something as follows:- (a) &amp; regards Persia proper, that we should revert to the ich we made some time ago, and ask His Majesty's vernment for a definite reply to which we would uucdjubu uuiiauittoe uouerax aiiu viue uonsuxa, Dirja.xja, ^aoux anu Zahidan/ \Ve might however suggest that Meshed and Sir jand are no longer of any particular importance to Inaia and that we should prefer to hand over Meshed also with Bir jand and maintain simply a Cpnsul as before at Zabul and a Vice-Consul at Zahidan. The other Consulates and Vice-Consuls in Persia, mhich we at present man, namely, Bushire, Kerman, Bandar Abbas, Ahwaz and Khorramsnahr would oe handed over entirely to the Foreign Office and we should cease to have any responsibility, financial or administrative for them. In order to retain some voice in major questions of policy, which fall to be dealt with by the Legation at Tehran^ we would a&amp;ree to pay a proportion net exceeding oneibhird of the cost of the British Legation at Tehran. The existing arrangement by uhich His Majesty's Govern ment and India share expenditure on Diplomatic and Consular Represen tation in Persia would of course ceaae; la) As regards the .arab side of the Persian Gulf, your proposal would be that we should offer to hand over to His Majesty's Government the three Political Agencies of Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait together with the entire expense of maintaining them. The ground on which this would be justified would be that Indian interests in the Arab side of the Persian Gulf have very greatly decreased in recent years, where as Imperial interests nave increased to such an extent m the matter of oil, air route, and relations with Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran, all of which are His Majesty's Government's responsibilities, that they have entirely submerged any Indian interest which used to exist. This is particularly true in the case of Bahrain where the pearl industry in vhich India was interested, has now given place to oil industry. There would remain the question of the Political Resident and there may be some doubt whether with three Levantine Service Political Agents, the Foreign Office or Colonial Office, as the case might be, would wish to retain a Poli tical resident solely to supervise these three officers. Sven if they did wish to retain^ they might obviously desire to put in an officer from an iu non-Indian service and the Government of India would after some time find it increasingly difficult to supply an officer with the requisite experience. Our suggestion, therefore would be that we should find the officer for some time after the transfer and would pay half the expenses of the post so long as an Indian Service officer filled it. 2 . I found it difficult at the moment to put forward any really telid arguments against your su, realise that I cannot commit ei ^estions, but would ask you to er myseif or this Department to resent. If however If however you wish to put something represent the provisional views of ild of course offer no objection. 1 their acceptance at pr on the file on these lines to the Finance Department, I should^of course offer no objection,, propose to discuss the matter with Fowle and it might also be use ful for you to talk to him about it vihile he is here» Yours sincerely, Sd.H.A.F.Me tcalf e* E.T.Coates,£sqr .ICS.

On the cpntrary the Imperial interests quoted by Mr. Coates have definitely increased these Indian interests. To come down to details. 4. (a$ The ^ir Koute y The Persian Gulf is now the 'Suez Canal/ of the Air*, the British Air Koute runs along the arab side, and it is only by this route that aircraft, military or civil, can reach India. It is of course vital to India that in case of emergency: on the North west Frontier, for instance, the K.A.F. in India can be reinforced from areas further west. Under this heading therefore the Government of India have a definite and closest possible interest in the Air Route. It may be argued that to accept this principle would involve the Government of India/ in being 'interested' in the whole of the Route, the Cairo-Bagbdad section for instance. Tjjis argument can of Cuurse be refuted on the grounds of geographical propinquity. Government of India, for example, pay the whole, or half (I do not know which) of the cost of the Kaoul Legation which is situated in a foreign country far beyond the Indian frontier. Naturally, I am not suggesting that the Government of India have the same interest in the Arab side of the Gulf as in Afghanistan, but the principle is precisely the same. A further argument in -tins direction is that - as I understand it - the Government of India in case of emergency are responsible for the military defence of the Gulf Air Route. If troops have to be sent to the Arab side to guard the Ro$£te, or for any other military purpose, they can only come from India. Your mentioned in the course of our conversation, though it is not in your letter to Mr .Coates, that the latter expressed the view that by arrangement with H.M.G. the Government^of India had washed their hands of the entire respsonibility f3&gt;r the Air Route, or any part of it. it would be interesting to see the exact terms in which this arrangement was set forth. lb) Pearl trade. The Pearl industry has not, as surmised by Mr .Coates, 'given place' to the Oil industry. What has happened is that the pearl industry had a slump, like most other induauiea of late years, but is showing some signs of a revival. Last year an exceptionally large pearl was found on a Kuwait pearl banx purchased by the Shaikh of that place, taken by him to England on his visit, and valued under prevailing prices at something like £ 7,000. This is nothing like the price which it would have fetched before the slump, but it shows that the bottom is bv no aBans completely^ out of the pearl market. (c) Oil . Far from the discovery of oil swamping Indian interests, as suggested by Mr .Coates, it has materially increased them. At Bahrain there is now a large oil company employing something like 300 European expert employees. One of our conditions witn tne Bahrain Oil Gom- any is that the proportion of British (including of course British Indians) to other employees should be roughly ^ th9 C0£ W2 o company observe this* There are many posts of varying grades can be, and are being, filled by Indians, and we have % 2J^ oax fXV-iO Wi Oil 0/16 C&lt; w wA —W n . .. there is another oilfield wfiicfi is being exilored with*encouraging ^? 8 ^ ec ^ s# Qatar a third which is about to be worked, and other possible fields on the Trucial Coast, and I n Muscat territory, mhich are being negotiated for. In all these fields tne conditipn as to the employment of a percentage of British employees will be operative, and as these fields develop Indians will find many avenues of employment* Indian communit ies* Quite apart from openings for Indians under the oil companies, there are already, as uhere have been ior many years, Indian trading communities in all the SM&amp;ikhdoms oi the Arab coast. At Gwadur. for example, which though surrounded by British territory i.e. Kalat State, is part of the Muscat State, tnere is a large community of Khojas - followers of His Highness the Aga Khan, and only a few years ago the Government of India (vifro onding with—— '— ) regarded the interests of this community in Iheir troubles with the local Baluchis as a matter of considerable importance. I assume the Government have not changed their views since then. At Muscat, on the Trucial Coast and Bahrain there are other Indian communities. At Kuwait there are only a few Indians, but the number will inevitably increase with the progress oi the oilfield as exolained above. ((0 Trade » Most of the trade on the arab coast is wither with, or through India, and nearly all of it is in the hands of Indian traders. 5. That in the face of the above arguments the Government of India can wash their hands of the Arab side of the Gulf, and like Gallic say they 'care for none of these things*, seems to me quite impossible. 6 . It seems to me/fqually impossible that Government should be prepared to relinquish their responsibilities in the area concerned into the hands of F.O.Consular Officers. 1 have no intention of criticising these officers. I have worked harmoneously with a number of Consular Officers, and during my time as Hesident I have had various members of that Service under'me (as you are aware the post of Vice Consul, Bushire is filled by a Consular officer ) on whom I have always been able to report favourably* For the particular work for which they are trained, trade ana purely consular duties generally, Consular officers are excellent, but for the particular work which they would be required to do on the Arab coast they would definitely not fill the tkll. Much of the important^ work in that area is of a Political or Diplomatic nature: dealing and negotiating with Shaikhs and so forth. Cpnsular,officers generally speaking have no experience of diplomatic work* Not only are they not encouraged to indulge in diplomacy, but they are definitely discouraged by the Embassies and Legations under whom they serve from attempting to do so, the said Embassies and Legations regarding such work as entirely their business and not that of the Consulates, a further, and perhaps more serious objection from the point of view of the Government of India,to the employment of Consular officers on the arab side is in regard to the Indian communities whom these officers would have under their charge. Consular officers know nothing about India or about.Indian manners, customs, or outlook upon life, ihey know no Indian language. They have no sympathy with Indians. They are entirely ignorant of Indian law . ^ J and one of the important duties of the Political Meats on the Arab coast is the administration of Indian law under the various Orders in Council.These remarks are not criticisms: they are statement of facts© There is obviously no reason whatever why Consular Officers in their particular walk of life should have this special knowledge or sympathy, but that they lack it is a serious bar to their employment in the area under consideration, and that it is a disqualification was recognised by Sir Hughe3, &lt; 4 *. Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hucessen, hitaself a F.O.official, vide his suggestions remedying this lack of Indian experience on the part ofTJonaular Officers (vide paras 3 and 4 of my note B dated the 14th March)® His suggestions were made in regard to the present admittedly small Indian communities in Persia who are in these days with the abolition of capitulations no longer in any way under the administration of Consular Officers. In an area such as the iirab side where Indian communities have to many intents and purposes to be actually administered by the local Political Agents, the lack of Indian experience on tne part of Consular Officers would of course be still more serious# 7r To turn to another point in connection with the Gulf® In para 1 of your letter to Mr .Coates occurd the following passage There would remain the question of the Political hesident, and there may be some doubt wiether with three Levantine service Political Agents, the Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, as the case might be. would wish to retain a Political hesident solely to supervise these three officers'# In the course of our conversation we discussed this point, and you asked for my comments which are as follows. If the Government of India (I believe that H.M # Gr. hold a somewhat different view) are really of the opinion that all the Resident has to do on the Arab side is to sit back and “supervise' three officers, then quite frankly I daaa despair of convincing Government of the importance of tne Arao side from any point of view, Indian or otherwise. In point of fact the scope ox the Resident's duties qn that side, lumping together Imperial and Indian interests, is bradlfly as follows, he has under him a territory of about one thousand miles in length, more or less, made up of some dosen Shaikhdoms of various sizes. These Shaikh- doms are now no longer in the 'bead and bludgeon' age: that is £o say in order to gain one's ends one cannot approach their Rulers with a bag or beads in one hand and a thick stick in the other. They have to be negotiated with in exactly the same way as the Rulers of Indian States. The subjects for negotiation are many and various, some of them complicated: agreements as to the ^ir Route, agreements for air facilities for the R.A.F., Oil agree ments etc.,etc.^ In addition to negotiating with these Rulers, the Resident has to ensure that they observe their treaties with Government, and bring pressure to bear if they show signs of failing in this respect. As well as these internal negotiations the Resident has to take a hand in negotiations on foreign affairs connected with Saudi Arabia and Iraq: e.g. Saudi- frontiers, Saudi blockade of Kuwait, Kuwait-Iraq smuggling, Bahrain-baudi transit dues question, and so forth. He has also to see that the interests of the Shaikhs are protected vis-a-vis the foreign powers bordering on the Gulf, e.g# Kuwait bate Gardens in Iraq, the molesting of Arab Bhows by the Persian havy (in the latter connection two cases have occurred in the last two months.,) So much for the Political side of the Resident's work# On the administrative side he has to see that the various Orders in Council in the various Shaikhdoms are correctly implemented by the Political Agents (as you are aware has he nas trie powers oi a Chief Court), and has to look after generally the Indian communities in the various Shaikhdoms in nis area. Things on the administrative side are becoming increasingly complicated and as you are aware in the last few years various King's Regulations nave had to be discussed, drafted, and finally published. All this in itself involves not a little work# Further, exactly tne same problems are now growing dp in the more advanced of tne Shaikhdoms, e.g. Bahrain, as Government have to deal with in India. There is a desire for 'popular Government' as against the autocratic rule of the Snaikhs ( benevolent oh the whole as tx.is is), for education, for medical and qther social services. In,these directions the Resident has to give a tactful, helping and controlling hand.4. (ze IS. In other words, the Resident has to be in himself a sort of Grovernment of India in miniature, and though of course I m somewhat prejudiced on the subject, I am inclined to think that he /t earns his pay* 80 Finally *itn reference to the possibility of the Arab side pf the Gull being at some future date placed under Aden# This is Quite impossible^ Men is quite unconnected with the Gulf, is far removed from it and comnunication between Aden and the Gulf, except for an emergency jir Route is by steamer which takes anytning up to 10 days or a fortnight# 1 am afraid tnat I have made this note a very long one, but the questions dealt with are important and I should be glad to discuss them with you whenever you can spare the time* Sd# T#C.Fowle* 15*3#1937* ISomething on the lines of course ( 4 .) is perhaps the hest e.g. a suggestion to Mr. Caroe v that, now that the war has supervened, it will be best to postpone the further discussion of tfiis controversial question. What are the provisional arrangements about political etc. expenditure in the Persian Gulf in connexion with the war? Has any ratio been agreed upon for any items already dealt with? In any case is not the final incidence to be settled after the war? If so, this might be a further reason for postponing the question of a new allocation of ordinary expenditure till after the war also. -7 mA.INDEXED COHFIDENTTAI..

I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with the letter from the India Office No. P.Zol924/39, dated the 11th of May 1939, and to address you further on the subject oi tne incidence of diplomatic and consular expendi ture in Iran and the Persian Gulf. It may be of assistance in considering this matter to set forth in the broadest outline the main features of the solutions that have hitherto been proposed. The proposals made in the letter from the Government of India in the consular establishments incurred on an average of r e c en t three^/years in Iran and the Persian Gulf should be taken as the Govremment of India* s fixed contrioution, wnich they would not exceed. The i sum worked out to Rs. 9.15 lakhs, say 9 lakhs and was to be subject to review after five years 5 (b) that the Government of India would make a contri bution to the new Bahrain Residency and attached quarters and offices,(a contribution to be London.

His Majesty's Government expressed their agreement in general terms to the limitation of the Government of India's contribution towards the new Bahrain Residency to a figure of 6 lahhs. They suggest, hov/ever, that if the actual expendi ture were to exceed the estimate finally approved the Government of India should meet the same proportion of the excess as that which 6 lahhs bore to the approved estimate. 4. It has been separately agreed that the Residency at Bahrain should not be constructed at present and that no initiative should be taken in the direction of moving the Residency from Bushire vide recent correspondence ending with India Office letter Ho. P.Z.7802/39, dated the 19th of December 1939. ,/e need not therefore consider this question further beyond reiterating that, in the event of the move of5® Having thus disposed of the Residency question I am now to turn to the general problem. It is true that the cost in actual cash of the Foreign Office proposals (based on certain assumptions as to the extent of representation con- sildered necessary for Indian interests in Iran) does not greatly exceed that which would fail to be borne by the Government of India under the proposals made in their letter of the 12 th of November 1937. It is necessary to remember, however, that in assessing the financial effect of any pro posal not only the amount payable but also the return received for that payment must be taken into consideration. The Government of India* s offer, as is implied in paragraph 10 of the letter of the 12 th of November 1937, went very much further than they considered could be justified on the ground of Indian interests in Iran and the Persian Gulf, but was put forward with a view to securing two points of principle to each of which considerable importance was attached, namely - (a) a definition, limitation and stabilisation of India 1 s financial commitments in Iran and the Gulf, and (b) the naintenance of the existing system of administration and control over policy. It is evident that under the Foreign Office proposals the GovJernment of India fail to secure either of these objectives. Any increase in expenditure on the Arabian side of the Gulf, even though occasioned almost entirely by the expansion of Imperial int»ej.ests on ^hao littoral, would fall wholly on Indian revenues. In addition, the Government of India, to whom, as-4- as explained elsewhere in -this letter, policy and affairs in East Persia are of close and direct concern, would under the Foreign Office proposals cease to have the same direct contact with those matters, which would no longer be handled on the spot by officers drawn from their services. It is hardly to be expected that proposals which at the very lowest and on the most favourable interpretation would cost the Government of India more than the figure to which thq&gt;r were prepared to go, yet which fail to secure either of the two principles in consideration of which they agreed to that figure, can be regarded as attractive 0 6 * The Foreign Office proposals amount to this. In Iran His Majesty^ Government would meet all expenditure necessary for, but strictly limited to, the safeguarding of Imperial interests, while India would pay to the extent that Indian interests require. On the Arabian side of the Gulf, where there are admittedly both Imperial and Indian interests, His Majesty^ Government would pay nothing but India would meet the whole expenditure. Put thhs, the essential unfairness to India of the proposals would seem to be beyond argument* 7. The Government of India consider it high time that a satisfactory solution of their claims in regard to expenditure in Iran and the Persian Gulf were treated as a matter of urgency* Nevertheless they are anxious for a reasonable and friendly settlement of this question of incidence which has been outstanding for so many years, and they see in the Foreign Office proposals a basis for that settlement. 3. So far as Iran is concerned, the Foreign Office proposals proceed on the equitable basis of payment in accordance with interest, i.e. each Government pays where and to the extent that its in-cerests require, control following financial liability. They consider, as the Foreign Office themselves recognise, that there is no possible justification forfor the Government of India continuing to pay half the expenditure even for the Legation at Tehran and for consular posts in Persia distant from India, which have, little, if any, bearing on Indian interests. They agree, therefore, that the Foreign -Office should assume full responsibility for the staffing and financing of these posts. The Government of India would see the strongest objection to surrendering their present interest in the east Iran consulates for the following reasons. 3ast Iran, in the first place, is of very great political and strategic importance to Inaia. It marches for about 300 miles with Indian Balucxiistan and for about 400 miles with Afghanistan and the attitude of the tribesmen has to be watched along the whole of this border with a view to possible repercussions both in Indian Baluchistan and Afghanistan. Although the foreign policies of the latter country are no longer subject to the control of the Government of India, a peaceful and stable Afghanistan is essential for the peace of the Indian frontier. The tribes of Bast Iran could cause trouble in Western Afghaiistan, if stirred up by enemy agents, and the stability of the Western part of Afghaiistan is and will remain an important factor in the protection of the frontiers of India as a whole. This is more than ever the case at present in view of the uncertain attitude of Russia. Of the British subjects in East Iran other than Consulate Staffs over 99 per cent are Indians. There is trade between East Iran and India by the Zahidan route where there is a system for the rebate or refuna of customs duties paid on goods imported to Iran through Indian ports. Further Meshed is an important place of pilgrimage for Shias from India. The Government of India are prepared in tliese circumstances to continue to staff and to pay for the east Iran con^ulctx.Oc-, i.e. taie Ahorasan Consulate General with its vice—consulates at Meshed and Zabul, and the Vice—Consulate and n ade—Agency a Zahidan* The Foreign Office would assume full responsibility for the remaining posts in Iran (includingT L.-A !M^&gt;—pp—II I II———C-,. • -...' '. — ; - —— —-•^T’— • 6 - the consulate at Kerman) except the Bushire Residency which, for the purpose of the present reference is considered as forming part of the establishments for the Arab coast* 9* The same underlying principle should in the opinion of the Government of India be applied to a determination of the incidence as between the two Governments of the expendi ture incurred on the Arabian side of the Gulf. It is recog nised, however, that on this side there is not so clearly marked a territorial division oi interests as there is in Persia, and hence apportionment of financial liability on the basis of interest must necessarily involve an attempt at an evaluation of the relative interests of the two Governments. This is perhaps hardly, possible with any pretence to accuracy, but, if an attempt is made to classify interests in the Gulf e.g. defence, the growing oil industry, the air route and communications generally, naval and R.A.F. bases, relations with Iraq, Sa T udi Arabia and the Trucial Shaikhs, a declining pearl industry, pilgrim traffic, Indian employees of oil companies and some Indian trading communities, it is reasonably safe to assert that Imperial interests are certainly not less than Indian interests* There is, in these cases, clearly a decisive case for a substantial limitation of the Government of India 1 s liability in this area. Strong arguments could be advanced for a reduction of that liability below even the 50 per cent which it at present represents in the case of Kuwait. * The Government of India, however, anxious as they are to reach a reasonable and equitable settlement of this question, would be prepared, on the understanding that arrangements in relation to the control of Arab policy remain as at present, to agree i to accept liability for 55 per cent of expenditure. Moreover, « . . — ’ 'in view of the fact that Imperial interests on the Arab littoral 1 a- e grovii.^ while Indian interests are uec«Lining, and in view Ox one imperative need zor making some concession to the strength oj. Indian reeling against the Government of India* s present....7- N prasent unlimited liability on this coast, it seems only reasonable that the Government of Indian commitments should, as urged in our letter of the 12th of November 1937, be expressed in terms of a fixed contribution to be reviewed at the end of a period of five years. 10. It is realised that to fix India's fixed contri bution on the basis of a 55 per cent share of the present expenditure on the Arab coast would, together with the cost of the east Iran consulates estimated at Rs. 2^- lakhs, impose upon India a total contribution which would fall short of the figure of Rs. 9 lakhs suggested in 1937. The proposals put forward by the Foreign Office are from the point of view of the Government of India for the reasons indicated above so exceedingly unsatisfactory that there is, in the Government of India 1 s view, a very strong case for the reduction in question. Again, however, in the interests of a friendly and early settlement, they have no desire to press their case unduly and would be content if their contribution were to be fixed at Rs. 6 ^ lakhs for the first quinquennium. This would amount to approximately 3/4ths of the total expendi ture on the Arab coast (including that on the Bushire Residency) and together with the Rs. 2.g lakhs for ‘the east Iran consulates would m^ke up the total figure of Rs. 9 lakhs ] previously promised. At the ena of the first five years the contribution for 'the Arab coast will be refixed on the basis of a 55 i 45 share of Arab coast expenditure and the cost of the east Iran consulates wall continue to be borne by the Government of India. 11 . The Government of India's proposals may thus be sumnnrised briefly as follows:- (a) The Government of India to staff and pay for the east Iran consulates, the Foreign Office taking over full responsibility for the remaining consulates in Iran. (b) The Government of India to malce a fixed contribu tion of Rs, 6 G- laichs towards the cost of the agencies.,.L \U '&lt;*J i agencies on the Arab coast, this contribution to be refixed after five years for a fbrthl five years on the basis of a 55 of the expenditure then appertaining to these agencies. 12. It will not be impossible, it is contended, to re concile these proposals with the objections raised in paragraph 5 of the Foreign Office letter dated the 17th of March 1939. To meet the first of these, the Government of India would, of course, agree to make no increases in the agencies without the prior approval of His Majesty*s Government. They would go further and, in deference to the Foreign Office* s comments under tales, on the scale of expenditure would atxxx^ during the course of the first quinquennium, a. thorough review of the scale of expenditure on the Residency and the Arab coast agencies. This review would of course have to wait until after the war had ended. If any economies were then to prove practicable, His Majesty* s Government would derive the benefit of them when the contribution comes to be refixed at the end of the quinquennium* if none were possible - and the Government of fear India^that this may well be the conslusion - the Foreign Office would still have the satisfaction of knowing that no effort had been spared, to effect economy in administration. The second objection would be met, to some extent, as the Foreign Office would then be free to staff from the Consular Service the consulate at Herman and the Vice-Consulate at Khorramshahr which have in the past been staffed by the Indian Political Service, although whether, in view of difficulties experienced by the Foreign Office in filling for example the post of vice consul at Bushire from the Consular Service, they will be able to take advantage of this change, remains open to some doubt. The proposals would also, to a very great extent, eliminate the accounting inconveniences of the existing arrangements since any excess over the Government of India's fixed contribution would automatically be met by His Majesty*s Government-9- C iv 7 - i 2 ^ ■■■ / 42 D \J Government. It would be only on proposal^ fo^Qf-idjc^asei in expenditure that there v/ould have to be consultation between the two Governments. 13. The Government of India trust that they have succeeded in putting forward proposals which not only satisfy the requirements of His Maje 3 ty f s Government but will also go far to meet the legitimate demands of Indian taxpayers. They venture to express the view that the order of the sums involved should not, from the point of view of His Ivlajesty* s Government, constitute a serious cause of delay, and they trust that these long outstanding claims will noti promptly be met.

Their views have been / / communicated in a telegram of the 26th October, a copy of / / which is enclosed herewith. The Govern sent of India have subsequently stated that this telegram has been repeated to His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran and also to the Middle East Intelligence Centre, Cairo. 2. With regard to the proposals for the construdtion of the Residency at Bahrein, the present position is that detailed estimates and plans have been communicated to the Treasury for consideration in consultation with the Office of Works. The latest estimate of the cost of the Residency was stated by the Government of India in July to be approximately Rs.20i lakhs, though the possibility of some small reduction in this sum was not excluded. Hitherto the Government of India have declined in any circumstances to/ Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.l.A K-* 2 . to pay more than Es .6 lakhs of the total cost of the new 'building* 'but, even though on this 'basis they would not be affected by any increase in building charges, they suggest nevertheless that a scheme v/hich has never commanded their full support should be reconsidered in the light of present circumstances. On financial grounds alone Lord Zetland feels that it would be inexpedient to proceed aith building proposals which are not urgently necessary at a time when costs are presumably rising and it may be difficult to foresee what relation the final cost would bear to the present estimates. He would propose therefore that further action should be suspended for the present on the proposal for the construction of the Residency at Bahrein. 3. As regards the retention during the war of the Resident’s personal connection with Bushire, it v/ill be recalled that the question of his continued presence at Bushire was under consideration some time before the outbreak of war when it was generally assumed that when war occurred it would be necessary for the Resident to withdraw from Bushire in order to avoid giving the Persian Government any cause for complaint that he was carrying out on Persian soil functions that might be considered incompatible with his residence in a neutral country. There have however been indications recently that there may be less risk of Persian objections to the presence of the Resident on Persian soil in time of war than was supposed. The Persian Government raised no objection when asked to agree to Major Prior’s appointment, and it is reported that the attitude of the Persian authorities at/3. at Bushire at the end. of August was more friendly than for years past* So far as Lord Zetland is aware there has been no sign since the war started of any desire on the part of the Persian Government to demand the withdrawal of the Resident from Bushire and it would perhaps seem improbable that at a time when their anxieties about Soviet policy are acute they would wish to invite a dispute with His Majesty’s Government over a question of this kind. 4. Major Prior, who left Bushire early in September and has fixed his headquarters temporarily at Koweit, has informed the Government of India that he will be obliged to return to Bushire from time to time, and the Government of India for their part think it very desirable tnat he should maintain contact with Bushire. It certainly seems inadvisable to sever, unless this should become necessary, any link which might facilitate the obtaining oi information and the exertion of British influence in Persia including South Persia, at the present time. A further reason for the Resident’s maintaining contact with conditions in South Persia, is the importance, as pointed oul by the Government of India, of having a senior political officer with Persian and Indian experience available in South Persia in the event of a serious threat to the security of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s property, particularly as the measures that might have to be taken in that event in defence of the oil fields might include the despatch cf Indian troops. Lord Zetland, therefore, feei.s that there is force in the considerations advanced by the/the Government of India and. he hopes that Lord Halifax will agree that the Resident should maintain personal contact with Bushire, as proposed hy them. It also seems desirable that any steps that may he necessary should he ta.ken to ensure adequate liaison between the Resident and His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz. 5.

Persian Gulf Residency. As you are aware we have again been considering the question of incidence of Persian Gulf expenditure and expenditure in Iran together with linked question of transfer of Residency from Bushire to Bahrain. Government of India have always regarded transfer of Residency as ol doubtful advantage. Since our* liability is i.’L any case limited to six lakhs of rupees we are not effected by any increase in building costs due to war; but we are naturally anxious not to incur any avoidable expenditure. We have seen no signs as war develops of a desire on part of Iranian Government to make demand that Resident should leave Bushire and both Fowle and Prior have reported that local attitiide of Persian authorities which is now always dictated from Tehran has been more friendly recently than for many years. We suggest therefore that this question now be reconsidered. Apart from financial considerations there are other grounds for postponing move. We think that war developments will/will force on Ills Majesty v s Government a re-orientation of their plans In this quarter. For some time partly as legacy of last, war and partly feel owing to failure of diplomatic insistence at Tehran, Iran, alone of the four Saadahad powers, has been inclined to withdraw further from His Majesty s Government and she has also offered scope to German penetration on considerable scale. Our reports * show that Iran equally with Afghanistan is intensely nervous of ne?/ Soviet attitude and. expects, if she has not already experienced, strong pressure from Russia both political and economic to amend her tendency to comparative autarky. It must at present remain a matter of speculation whether Russian and German pressure will he extended to endeavour to control exports from Persian, oilfields but we suppose possibility of such development must he faced. 3. For these reasons for (sic) we think it important that every effort should be made to increase political and economic influence of His Majesty's Government and Government of India in Iran. Supply of intelligence from Iran is at present lamentably deficient and cannot be improved until British status in that country has acquired added prestige. Iranian Government irsv'fc already asked for India's assistance in obtaining railway materials and. sugar in large quantities and for markets for wool. We shall shortly be addressing you on possibilities of assistance by India :\n the development of trade with Iran as means of increasing political influence. 4. If His Majesty's Government agree that political and economic influence of both countries should be increased then adequate representation of India's prospective/prospective trade and political interests also requires pi&lt; senee oi tne Resident on Persian soil. This is an added argument favour of cancellation of the plans for more of the Residency for duration of the war. In any case during the war we anticipate that the Resident will spend much of his time on tour and to this end we have recently agreed to the provision of special sea transport.

Please see the minutes on P.Z.7846/37 describing the proposals of the Government of India for the future incidence of diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia and the Persian Gulf. Briefly these were (1) that H.M.G. should bear half the cost of expenditure at Bahrein and Muscat now borne by the Government of India entirely; (2) that the Government of India’s expenditure on Persia and the Gulf, excluding Bahrein and Muscat, should be fixed at a lump sum of 9 lakhs which would be stabilised over a period of 5 years. H.M.G. would be liable for all expenditure whether on capital or on revenue account in excess of the Government of India’s contribution. While this arrangement lasts there should be no change in existing administrative arrangements, e.g. the Goverment of India should continue to staff the posts which they now staff in Persia. The financial effect of these arrangements was estimated to increase the liability of H.M.G. by rather more than £12,500. ( 5 ) The Government of India’s promise to pay 6 lakhs for the transfer of the Residency to Bahrein (now estimated to cost 17j lakhs) to be conditional on the above scheme being adopted. Our letter to the Foreign Office putting forward these proposals, issued on the 16th March, 1938. In November the Foreign Office sent us a d.o. letter, putting forward counter proposals, and suggested an Interdepartmental meeting. This took place on the/ 7175 Wt 8900/111 10,000 4.382 . the 14th December, see the note at P.Z.7965, and as the result it was agreed that the Foreign Office should have now done in their letter of the 17th March, P.Z.17D Their objections to the Government of India’s proposals are ( 1 ) that while they provide for the limitation of the Governtient of India’s expenditure they do not provide any guarantee to H.M.G. in respect of increases in expenditure incurred at posts staffed by officers of the Indian Political Service; (2) they do not take account of the Persians’ dislike of the in Persia; (3) they do not eliminate the accounting inconvenience of the present arrangements under which expenditure is shared - on the contrary they would exte the area in respect of which this inconvenient system is in force. The Foreign Office feel, therefore, that the time has come for a reconsideration of the present system and they propose (1) that H.M.G. should take over responsibility ibr maintaining diplomatic and consular posts in Persia without any contribution from India. If the Government of India wish to supplement these aopoint :ents by maintaining additional appointments to serve India’s special interests they could do so at their own expense provided that these aopointments are under the general control of officers of the Consular Service; (2) In view of the substantial saving to the Government of India under these arrangement they, in their turn, should assume responsibility for all expenditure on posts on the Arab side of proceed to state their case officially.

They point out that if their scheme goes through the Foreign Office will no longer he concerned with the expenditure on the new Residency which will he a matter for discussion between this Office / and the Treasury. As regards the financial effect of their scheme ,* the Forel'g^Offl ce point out that, according to their calculations, the Government of India T s contribution under their own scheme iicnyld have been 10.133 lakhs instead of 9 lakhs, while under the Foreign Office scheme it would he 10.533 lakhs. This is not a big difference and as the Foreign Office say it should he possible hy economies to reduce this figure, particularly in respect of expenditure on the Political Residency once it has been moved to Bahrein. The Foreign Office scheme appears to have considerable attractions and v/ill certainly make for simplification. The financial effect is not unfavourable to India and if we can persuade the Treasury that there is a case for a contribution from H.M.G. in view of the imperial interests involved in the Gulf, which we ought to be able to do, it is/ &lt;?V* A / OSJ —r ^/4( J $ ( , £ ^ rw U. ^ ^foi**-* !*&gt;■ Zjfc.

It is proposed, therefore, that we pass on the Foreign Office letter to India with a definite lead in favour of the F.O. scheme. Unfortunately we know from Sir Aubrey Metcalfe’s d.o. letter of the 18th March, P.Z.1924, that the Government of India’b reactions to the F.O. proposals are not favourable. They still maintain their objections to handing over the East Persian Consulates to the British Consular Service but their reasons in present circumstances are not very convincing. Possibly, if they feel such strong objections to placing subordinate personnel from India under members of the Consular Service, they might prefer the idea of having an officer of the Government of India appointed as Counsellor at Tehran, and it is proposed to put this suggestion to Sir A. Metcalfe in a d.o. letter. As regards the transfer of the Political Residency, the Government of India are taking a very obstructive line and the F.O. have some reason to complain of their attitude, even though it may be true to some extent that the move to transfer the Residency from Bushire seems to come more from the F.O. than from the Persians themselves. However that may be it is desirable that s-«&lt;. ujC Mi nut /TF 74^ J. t K474b Wt/ t Vl ^ ^ P. 3 . 1924 / 39 . IKDIn 0??ICE, *HITLHaLI., LONDON, 3...1. 11th i.lay, 1939 . Sir, './ith reference to your letter of the 12th November, 1937» No. N.457-N/37? I am directed by the Secretary of State to invite attention to the Foreign Office letter of the 17 th March (a copy of which was sent to you by air mail on the 3 ^st Maich) on the subject of the transfer of the Residency from Sushire to Bahrein and the incidence of diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia and the rersian Gulf. 2. As v/ill have been seen, the Foreign Office again emphasise the importance, from the standpoint of British relations with Persia, of reaching an early and definite decision for the transfer of the Political Resident’s headquarters from Persian territory before a demand for the transfer is formally made by the Persian Government. Even though it should prove that the x-ersian Government will not alter all raise the issue as early as has been anticipated, nord Zetland would nevertheless, if only by reason of the administrative advantages which would attend the location of the Residency at Bahrein, be glad to see early effect given to a decision which has already been agreed to in principle. As regards the financial issues involved Kis Lordship hopes that the views of the Treasury set forth in Mr. Hale's letter of the 23rd January, a copy of which was sent to Major Hay ..ith my demi-official letter of the 4th February, No. P.' 3 . 311/39&gt; will receive favourable consideration, and that the Government of India v/ill not press the stipulation made in your/ The Secretary to the Government of India, External affairs Department.2 . your letter of the 12 th November* 1937 &gt; which in all the circumstances he finds it difficult to support, viz. that their contribution to the cost of the new Residency should be regarded as conditional on the acceptance by Kis Majesty’s Government of their proposals for regulating the incidence of diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia and the Persian Gulf. As the Government of India will observe, this general question of incidence has already been under the consideration of His Majesty’s Government for a considerable time, and as the Foreign Office point out it seems not impossible that some further period may necessarily elapse before a solution satisfactory to the different financial authorities is found. The transfer of the Residency to Bahrein on the other hand is desirable on political grounds, which are by no means confined to the apprehensions in regard to the Persian Government entertained by the Foreign Office. The Secretary of state suggests that it is in the interests of the Government of India as well as of His Majesty’s Government that the Residency should be located on the ^i.rab shore of tie Gulf, where most of the vorit of the Resident lies and where he would presumably have to be stationed in the event of an emergency. It has, therefore, now become urgently advisable to come to a definite decision to transfer the Residency so that the construction of the new building may commence at the earliest possible date. 3* On the major financial issue the Foreign Office have put forward proposals alternative to those made by the Government of India. After stating, in x-^aragraph 5 o&gt;f their letter, certain objections to the Government of India’s scheme they suggest that His Majesty’s Government should ‘’take over the responsibility for establishing and maintaining diplomatic and/■ Hillat the expense of the United and consular posts in Persia, Kingdom, and without any contribution from India, on the understanding that posts would of course only be maintained in those towns where British consular representation was, in the view of Kis Majesty’s Government, justified by Imperial interests’.’ There would be no objection to certain subordinate appointments being staffed and paid for by India if the Government of India considered them necessary for the protection of special Indian interests. The Foreign Office supply figures to show that the changes resulting from their proposals would effect an appreciable reduction in the Government of India’s present contribution to the shared expenditure, and they suggest that in return the Government of India should assume responsibility for all expenditure on the Arab side of the Gulf. This latter expenditure, however, they do not regard as their concern, and indicate that any question of a contribution from Imperial revenues in relief thereof should be discussed direct with the Treasury. The proposals of the Foreign Office do not, as they stand, entirely meet the requirement of the Government of India that their share of diplomatic and consular expenditure should not exceed 9 lahhs, although they marK a substantial advance in that direction, and if a reasonable contribution could be secured from the Treasury towards the cost of expenditure on the Arab coast it should be found possible to keep the total cost to India within the suggested limit. Moreover, the proposals of the Foreign Office, if accepted, would greatly simplify the accounting complications inseparable from the existing method of sharing the total expenditure in Persia and the Gulf.4. 4. Before making any approach to the Treasury for a contribution in relief of Indian expenditure on the Arab Coast Lord Zetland desires to be furnished with the G-overnment of India’s views on the proposals now advanced by the Foreign Office. He is aware of the objections felt in the past by the Government of India to any general transfer to the / Foreign Office of the rersian appointments staffed from India. He feels nevertheless that the matter should be reviewed afresh in the light of present-day circumstances and he trusts that the proposals of the Foreign Office will receive from the Government of India the careful consideration which in his view they deserve.

Although the Foreign Office proposals follov/ the lines which you criticise in your letter we have felt it necessary to commend them to the careful consideration of the Government of India. Frankly we do not feel wholly convinced of the case for refusing to transfer the superior consular appointments at present staffed from India. It will be seen that the Foreign Office contemplate that the Government of India might continue to man such vice-consular posts in East xersia as they were willing to pay for. 3* Present-day conditions in Persia are in any case very different from v/hat they used to be; and it may also be a question whether the centralisation of the administration has not/ Sir H.-rk. F. Metcalfe, iiOIa. , Obi. , i/IVO. , ExterrialixdT.fairs department. I, vnot considerably diminished the value of the influence v/hich Indian political officers were formerly able to exercise on the local authorities, and whether the 3hah ! s xenophobia and the resulting boycott of British consulates have not operated in the same direction. 4. If this is so, a question which&gt;\jiy be worth consideration, is whether in the conditions of to-day Indian interests would perhaps be better served by asking the Foreign Office for the attachment of an Indian political officer to the Legation, say with the rank of Counsellor, than by keeping our hold on the Consulates. I do Ajot know how the Foreign Office would regard such a suggestion, but if you think that an arrangement of this kind would help, we shoala be ready to put it to them. In any case we hope that the Foreign Office proposals will be examined on their merits as carefully as possible. 5. './ith regard to the Residency the Treasury seem to us to be taking a reasonable line and we very much hope that you will oe aole to get this question dealt with independently of the major issue of diplomatic and consular expenditure, and ^n early settlement reached. '7e ourselves feel that the move/move to Bahrein would make for administrative convenience and economy and we fear that the long delay in preparing for the move may have awkward consequences if war breaks out and the Resident is obliged, as we think would be almost inevitable, to transfer his headquarters to Bahrein. It seems clear that in the event oi war or emergency it would be most important that the Resident should have his headquarters on the Arab side of the Gulf and not be cooped up in Bushire. 6. It is true, of course, that the Foreign Office fears of the Persians raising the question of the continuance of the Resident in .Persia in the near future may be belied, but if they do raise it I am afraid we see little hope of persuading the Foreign Office to take a stiff line on the basis of normal international practice? which after all would hardly justify the exercise of control over the ii.rab coast from headquarters in Persian territory.

O 1 x Thanks for your letter No. 1093/39, dated the 1st March 1939, regarding the question of the incidence of diplo- mtic and consular expenditure in Persia and the Persian Gruif. We were interested to hear of the line which the Foreign Office are likely to take. I have not looked up the papers, but lay impression is that the Foreign Office have been trying for a long time not only to get the Resident out of Bushire but also to secure for their own Consular Service the posts in East Persia. I feel quite sure that any attempt to put subordinate personnel from India into posts in Persia under Members of the British Consular Service would not be a success, whether the personnel were Indian or British, and I think that Jcoa^cI m (5 we have expressed this view several times before. One *vU*»v V'.C*4.&lt;Y difficulty about handing over the Eastern Persian Consulates, VM 3*i«j J/, 1 Meshed, etc. would be that Members of the British Consular Service would have little or no experience of Indian conditions and their work is principally concerned with looking after the interests of British Indian subjects and dealing with Indian officials in Baluchistan. 2 RECo.

The Foreign Office must be well aware point to the normal international practice, which we observe Persia. I realize that you may find it difficult to persuade the Foreign Office to adopt this line, but we hope that you will do your best. 3. I am not quite sure what is meant by paragraph 9 of Baxter’s letter. Presumably it only means that the India Office, who are the Department of His Majesty’s Government senior partners^should take over and defend expenditure in that area from Imperial Revenues and it does not mean that Imperial Revenues should cease to contribute at all as at present to expenditure on the Arabian side. However, all Government the question of Prior’s agrement and we might at ' that we are making no arrangements to accommodate the Resident elsewhere and it seems to us that, if the Persians do make trouble about Prior, we ought to take a stiff attitude and in accepting Diplomatic and Consular Representatives from responsible for policy in the Gulf and on the Arabian side as thisMr. Peel. The Foreign Office letter marks a welcome advance from the position hitherto maintained aififie the Government of India ought to be pleased with their admission that there is^ no reason why India should contribute to the cost of diplomatic and consular represent at i on i,p Persia. It is true that before proposing themselves to pay for the Persian posts they know that one of the most expensive, Bushire, will be transferred to Bahrein where, under their plan, it will have to be maintained by India. We do not admit that H.M.G. have no interest in posts on the Arab side and although the Foreign Office disclaim financial responsibility they leave it to us to negotiate with the Treasury for any assistance towards the cost of these posts that we think we are entitled to. The Government of India will, I think, augEroat that we should make an attempt to get some assistance. There is not a very large gap between India’s offer and what she will be left to bear: it would be met if H.M.G. would contribute half the cost of Indiatspresent expenditure at Bahrein and Muscat, which was one of India’s suggestions. I am not very impressed with the Foreign Office proposal4 that any grants made from H.M.G. should in future be borne on the Vote for the India Office Services^which will mean that the grants will have to be defended in Parliament and before the Estimates and Public Accounts Committees by the India Office. But this will be all one to the Government of India so long as they get a contribution. The Foreign Office proposals certainly seem to be well worth putting to the Government of India.In any further communication on this subject, please quote ^ No. R 1822/527/91 and address— any person by name -^t/The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. AV^ C° 17th March, 1959. ir J- i. 5 With reference to your letter No. P.6.7846/37 of the 16th March, 1938, enclosing a copy of a letter from the Government of India on the subject of the transfer of the Political Residency from Bushire to Bahrein and the incidence of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia and the Persian Gulf area, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to request you to inform the Marquess of Zetland that the Government of India’s views and proposals have now been fully considered in this department and discussed with His Majesty s ireasury. 2. Lord Halifax desires in the first place to point out that although the removal of the Residency to the Arab coast is, in his opinion, highly desirable from the point of view of Imperial interests, this is not, as the Government of India seem to think, the aspect of the question which mainly concerns him. In his capacity as the Minister responsible for Anglo-Persian relations, the practical aspect, i.e. the attitude of the Persian Government, is the important factor. Prom this point of view the removal of the Residency is necessitated mainly by the known unwillingness of the Persian Government to allow the present position, wherein a British official exercising important political functions on the Arabian side of the Gulf has his headquarters in Persia, to continue indefinitely. Lord Halifax wishes in this connexion to repeat his conviction, expressed in Foreign Office letter S 1522/461/34 The Under-becretary of btate, India Office. ENCLOSURE IN AIR MAIL LETTER NO. It i\ *. n FROM SECRET*.;*, POLITICAL AND SECRET DEPT. INDIA QFFIQKE 1522/461/34 of the 23rd May, 1938, that the Persian Government are in fact likely in the near future to insist upon the removal of the Political Resident, and in His Lordship’s opinion it will prove impossible for His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India to arrange for him to remain at Bushire against the wishes of the Persian Government, It is possible that the Persian Government will raise the question in such a way as to permit the transfer from Bushire to be effected in a manner calculated to cause the least possible inconvenience to all concerned. There is on the other hand some reason to fear lest the Persian Government, as a result of some :l incident 1 ' in the Persian Gulf, such as may at any time take place, might retaliate by a public and formal demand for the Political Resident’s immediate withdrawal; and Lord Zetland will no doubt take the view that if, as appears unavoidable, His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India were forced to comply with such a Persian demand, the effect on British prestige and on the Political Resident’s position in the Arab States on the western shore of the Persian Gulf would be deplorable. The sooner, therefore, that His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India are in a position to announce their definite decision to remove the Political Resident from Bushire and to establish the Political Resident elsewhere, the more linely will it be that the Resident’s transfer, when it tak^s plaao t can be represented as the result of a decision reached by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India of their own free will, and not under compulsion from Tehran.3. In these circumstances, and since the India Office are the Department of His Majesty's Government primarily concerned with ensuring that there shall continue to he suitable British representation in the Arab btates of the Persian Gulf, Lord Zetland will no doubt be anxious to proceed as quickly as possible with the necessary arrangements for providing adequate accommodation outside Persia for the Political Resident, There appears to be some danger that the necessarily complicated questions of finance, which have been raised in the Government of India's letter, may hold up the arrangements which have already been planned to provide accommodation for the Political Resident at Bahrein, The task of reconciling the financial desiderata of the Government of India with those of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom is, in the opinion of Lord Halifax, one which will have to be undertaken by your Department, in consultation with the Treasury on the one hand and the Government of India on the other, and since it may be some time before a final agreement is reached between the financial authorities concerned, Lord Zetland will presumably wish to make such arrangements as may be possible to ensure that measures are at once taken, 4 without awaiting the result of the.firfaftcial discussions, for the construction of the n^w buildings required at Bahrein or elsewhere to be started without further delay, 4. The cost of building the new Residency at Bahrein, it will be remembered, was originally estimated at Rs 12 lakhs, and it was proposed that the cost should be shared equally between the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, each of whom would pay Rs 6 lakhs. The proposalT ‘ z - proposal now made by the Government of India is, however, of a very different nature,, It is that the Government of India s share should be fixed at Rs 6 lakhs, and in no circumstances be increased; but the estimated share of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom has apparently already risen from Rs 6 lakhs to Rs Hi lakhs, and may presumably even exceed this sum if the actual cost of construction exceeds the present estimates. In paragraph 9 of this letter it is proposed that any further expenditure in respect of posts on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf, including expenditure on the construction of the Residency buildings at Bahrein, should no longer fail on the vote for Diplomatic and Consular Services, Should this proposal be accepted, this department would not be responsible for the expenditure on the new Residency, and Lord Halifax does not therefore propose to enter into the questions of financial control to which the new proposal of the Government of India gives rise. His Lordship understands that the views of the Lords Commissioners of His Maiesty’s Treasury on this subject have been communicated semi-officially to your Department (in Mr. Hale’s letter of the 23rd January to V Mr. Gibson). 5. Pull consideration has likewise been given to the Government of India’s further proposals regarding diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia and the Persian Gulf whereby India’s contribution should be limited to a fixed sum of Rs 9 lakhs a year, subject to revision after five years. His Majesty’s Government fully appreciate, and are prepared to take into account so far as possible, the Government of India’s wishes in regard to the limitation of their liabilities. The Government of India’s proposals, however, seem to require modificationmodification on some points. In the first place, while ! providing for the limitation, of the Government of India’s expenditure, they do not provide any guarantee to the Government of the United Kingdom in respect of increases in expenditure incurred at posts staffed by Officers of the Indian Political Service. Secondly, they take no account of the difficulties which have arisen in Persia at Consular posts staffed by the Indian Political Service, largely owing to the Persian Government’s dislike of the practice of appointing political officers from India to posts which, in other foreign countries, would be staffed by regular members of the British Consular Service. Thirdly, they do little to eliminate the accounting inconvenience of the existing arrangements, whereby there has to be continual consultation between the United Kingdorr and India respecting expenditure in Persia. Prom many points of view, the Government of India’s proposals seem to be open to exactly the same disadvantages as the ’‘Welby” arrangements of 1900, and would even extend the area in respect of which the present inconvenient system is in force, so as to apply not only to Persia, but also to the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf. 6. Lord Halifax shares the opinion that the time has come for the present system to be reconsidered, but in his view it is now necessary to examine a fundamental reorganisation based on existing facts, without too much regard to past history. 7. As regards Persia, there seems no reason why British diplomatic and consular arrangements in that country should now be different from those in other foreign countries. The special conditions existing before the war no longer apply. The reasonable solution would be for the United Kingdom to take overover the responsibility for establishing and maintaining diplomatic and consular posts in Persia, at the expense of the '''''lited Kingdom, and without any contribution from India, on the understanding that posts would of course only be maintained in those towns where British consular representation was, in the view of His Majesty's Government, justified by Imperial interests. If th^ Government of India wished to supplement these arrangements by establishing and maintaining additional appointments to serve India's special interests, there would be no objection to these appointments being made, and paid for, by India, provided that they were subordinate to and under the general superintendence of Officers of the Consular Service. Thus, His Majesty's Government would pay, as in other foreign countries, for diplomatic and consular representation in x^ersia wherever justified by Imperial interests, and India would pay for additional subordinate posts wherever required by India's special interests. 8. In practice, this scheme would mean that the Consular Service would be obliged to take over the British Consulate-General at Meshed and the Vice-Consulate at Kohammerah. It would be for consideration whether any post need be retained at Kerman, or at Bushire after the withdrawal of the Residency. The Government of India might wish to appoint, and pay for, an Indian Vice-Consul at Meshed, under the Consul-General, in order to help to protect Indian interests in that district, together with subordinate Vice-Consuls at Zabul and Zahidan, also under the Consul-General at Meshed, 9. In return for the very appreciable economies in Persia by which the Government of India would benefit through the acceptance of the proposals contained in the preceding paragraphsparagraphs of this letter, I am to suggest that the Government of India should he asked to assume responsibility for all expenditure incurred at the posts staffed by the Indian Political Service on the Arabian side of the Gulf. The Government of India would then be able in addition to obtain the full benefit of any economies which they may be able to introduce at those posts. Lord Halifax considers, however, that expenditure at these posts is not the concern of the Foreign Office; that the question what contribution, if any, should be paid by the Government of the United Kingdom in respect of these posts is a matter which should be discussed direct between the India Office and the Treasury; and that in ( future any further expenditure to be paid by the* Government of the United Kingdom in respect of these posts, including expenditure in connexion with the construction of the Residency buildings at Bahrein, should be charged to the vote for India and Burma Cervices and defended before the Public Accounts i Cormittee by the India Office. 10. Lord Halifax observes that the proposals of the Government of India are based rn the principle that their liability for expenditure in these areas should be limited in principle to one half of the total, and it appears that the figure of 9 lakhs to which it was proposed to limit their contribution represents an approximate moiety of the figure of total expenditure given in paragraph 11 of the Government of India's letter of the 12th November, 1937. It will be seen from the enclosed statement A that the total expenditure of both Governments on shared services in 1935-6 was approximat £127,000. The expenditure in respect of the Agencies at Bahrein and Mu l cat in 1935-36 is not known, but the average annualannual expenditure shown in the Government of India's letter referred to above is assumed to be approximately £25,000, as f ollows: - Bahrein £9,025 Muscat £12,100 Leave, pass-age and pension contributions and sterling pay £2,600 Miscellaneous charges 600 Civil Works 675 £25,000 The combined total would thus be £152,000, and a moiety thereof would be £76,000. It appears, therefore, that the principle on which the Government of India base their proposal, if applied to the later figures now available, would result in a contribution from India of approximately Ks. 10, 133 lakhs. 11. From statement B enclosed herein it will be observed that on these figures the Government of India expenditure under the proposals set forth in paragraphs 7 - 9 of this letter would amount to £54,000 plus £25,000, or a total of Rs, 10*533 lakhs* 12. This figure of Rs. 10*533 lakhs is, however, based on estimated expenditure in past years, and Lord Halifax does not doubt that it can be very considerably reduced. The Government of India will of course benefit by any economies which they may be able to effect in the maintenance of posts staffed by the Indian Political Service. Once the Political Residency has been removed to Bahrein, it should certainly be possible to reduce by a very considerable amount the sum of £35,000 per annum , whi ;h is quoted as the cost of the Residency at Bushire for the year 1935-36. Moreover, it may be found possible to effect economiesin the expenditure on the Agencies at Bahrein, I.uscat and Koweit, which is at present in each case far greater than that on corresponding consular posts in Persia. 13. These proposals take full account of the Government of India's wish to limit their expenditure on the diplomatic and consular establishments in these territories, and Lord Halifax trusts that Lord Zetland will feel able strongly to advocate their acceptance when transmitting them to the Government of India. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Treasury.

Treasury have concluded; if so, with what resuits? .. Sir Aubrey Metcalfe: (a) and (b). The expenditure incurred by this Department was on account of the pay and allowances of Diplomatic and Consular Officers and their staff, office contingencies and works in Iran and the Persian Gtdf, Kabul, Nepal, Kashear, Jeddah, Addis Ababa and Baghdad. There were also certain payments made under agreements of long standing to the Governments of Nepal and Muscat. (c) The revision of the present allocation of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Iran and the Persian Gulf between the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government so as to relieve the Indian Exche quer to some extent is under discussion with His Majesty’s Government. No other expenditure of this nature is at present under discussion, vide my answer to starred question No. 992, dated the 13th September, 1938. Mr. T. S. Avinashilingam Chettiar: In the Public Accounts Committee report which has been given to us, it is recommended that the matter of the expense of the Persian Gulf should be tacked on to the expenditure of His Majesty’s Government and the Government have said that the solution is in sight. That report was published nearly a year and half ago and I want to know where the matter stands now? Sir Aubrey Metcalfe: I have already explained that the matter is under discussion. I have never said that the solution is in sight. As I explain ed once before, the solution of this question is a matter for two parties. It cannot be an entirely unilateral decision. Mr. S. Satyamurti: Are Government aware that this discussion has been going on. to mv knowledge, for the last 13 to 15 years? Ever since . the Public Accounts Committee of this House was formed, it made a * recommendation, and it has gone on all these years. May I know the reasons for this delay? Sir Aubrey Metcalfe: Mainly the difficulty of arriving at a fresh agree ment with His Majesty’s Government. Mr. S. Satyamurti: Are they so intractable? Mr. President (The Honourable Sir Abdur Rahim): That is not a ques tion. For information, W. T. OTTEWILL. NOTE.— A copy has also been referred to ^ _ Department.

Satyamurti: Then, why have they taken 15 years? May I ask, then, with regard to other matters? Excepting Iran and the Persian Gulf, which have been under discussion for so many years, may I know what are the Indian interests involved in respect of the various other places which my honourable friend has mentioned (except Jeddah), on which we are spending Indian revenues? Sir Aubrey Metcalfe: I shall require notice of that question. Mr. Manu Subedar: Have Government considered the desirability of representing to His Majesty’s Government the question of other expenses incurred from Indian revenues abroad which the Honourable Member re counted in order to relieve the Indian treasury of these charges? Sir Aubrey Metcalfe. Government have felt, that on the whole, it is better to arrive at a decision on one question before taking up the others. Mr. T. S. Avinashilingam Chettiar: May I know the amount of money that is involved in this expenditure? Sir Aubrey Metcalfe: I have some figures with me which were con tained in a statement which I laid on the table in replv to question No. 992 on the 13th September. Roughly, the figures in 1936 and 1937 were about Rs. 30 lakhs. Mr. K. Santhanam: May I ask whether the expenditure with reference to the Residency in Nepal is also under discussion with His Majesty’s Government. Sir Aubrey Metcalfe : No. I have already explained that the only matter under discussion is expenditure in Iran and the Persian Gulf. Mr. Manu Subedar: May I ask why the other items cannot be taken up with His Majesty’s Government? Sir Aubrey Metcalfe: I have already explained that it is better to arrive at a decision on this question first. Mr. Abdul Qaiyum: Why should the Government of India pav this money when the policy is laid down by Whitehall? Sir Aubrey Metcalfe: That, again, is a question of which I shall require notice.* OFFICE, S.W.l. November, 1938, Dear Peel, We have been considering in some detail the India Office official letter No* P.Z* 7846/37 of the 16th March about the transfer of the Political Residency from Bushire to Bahrein, and the general subject of diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia and the Persian G-ulf area* We think that, before sending you an official reply, it would be well to hold an interdepartmental meeting between the India Office, Treasury and Foreign Office to discuss the various questions involved. I will therefore in this letter set out briefly the general line which we are likely *7 ,jl w*o take at such a meeting, and this will perhaps serve as a convenient basis for our discussions. i M 2. In the first place, we feel that the India Office would be wise not to allow all these complicated questions/ R.T. Peel, Esq., M.C7965 i953 questions of finance to hold up the arrangements which are 'being planned to accommodate the Resident on the Arab shore of the Gulf. As explained in our official letter of the 23rd May, we are convinced that the Persian Government will in the near future insist upon the Residents removal from Bushire. It may be that they will refrain from making difficulties until we have to approach them next year as regards the appointment of Fowle f s successor: but it is quite possible that they may take steps before that date. We presume therefore that you have by now considered some scheme for accommodating the Political Resident outside Persia, in case of need, before the new Bahrein Residency is built, and similarly we assume that you are anxious to push on with the construction of the new buildings at Bahrein. 3. As regards the Government of India’s wish to limit their expenditure on the new Residency building to a fixed contribution of 6 lakhs, the Treasury will be prepared to state their views at our meeting. I 0 understand that they are likely to take the line that, if India’s contribution is to be a fixed sum, they must have some guarantee that the works are planned and/L„ 7965 1938 and carried out with due economy. Originally, you will remember, the proposal was that the cost should he shared equally between the Government of India and the Imperial Government, each of whom would pay 6 lakhs. But the present proposal is that the Government of India’s contribution should in no circumstances exceed 6 lakhs, while the Imperial Government’s estimated share has already risen to ll£ lakhs (viz. £86,000), and may possibly be even more than this, if the cost of the whole building should happen to exceed the present estimate of 17^ lakhs. If the Government of India were prepared to meet a substantial proportion (not necessarily 50/o) of the cost, the Treasury would be prepared to allow them a reasonably free hand, but they feel that there would be strong objection to such an arrangement if the Government of India were to cease to have any financial interest in the economical planning and execution of the work. The Treasury will, however, explain their own views in further detail at the meeting. 4. As regards diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia and the Persian Gulf, we have considered ij 7965 L 1538 J the Government of Indian offer of 9 lakhs a yeaT&gt; subject to revision after five years. We note their wish that their expenditure should be limited. But His Majesty’s Government too would want some limit to be placer! on their expenditure, and the Treasury could obviously not be expected to agree to a system whereby the Imperial Government had to pay without question all increases in expenditure incurred at posts staffed by officers of the Indian Political Service. We should therefore have to make it a condition that the Government of India would have to obtain our consent to any increased expenditure at posts staffed from India; and we should similarly have to obtain the Government of India’s consent to any decreases in expenditure at our posts (since the Government of India would v/ant to be safeguarded against having to go on paying a fixed sum for objects which gradually come not to be met)# 5. Thus, in practice, the proposals made by the Government of India would mean the retention to some extent of the present unsatisfactory accounting arrangements by which there has to be continual consultation between the United Kingdom and India about expenditure in Persia# In fact, the new/ \7965 038 j new proposals would, from many points of view Tdc open to exactly the same disadvantages as the 'Welty' arrangements of 1900. Worse still, the new arrangements would apply not only to Persia, hut also to the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf. 6. In these circumstances, we have been considering whether it would not be possible to devise some arrangement which would be more satisfactory from our point of view, and at the same time meet the Government of India’s wish to limit their expenditure, and the sinplest method of approach is to regard the entire position as a new and open one requiring consideration on the merits of existing facts, without too much regard to past history. 7. As regards Persia, there seems to us no reason why our diplomatic and consular arrangements in that country should now be different from those in other foreign countries. The special conditions existing before the war no longer apply. The reasonable solution would therefore be for the Imperial Government now to take over the responsibility for establishing and maintaining diplomatic and consular posts in Persia, at their own expense and without any contribution from India, on the understanding that they/7965 jd) 938 I J they would, of course, only establish consular pb?rts in those towns where His Majesty’s Government think that British consular representation is justified by Imperial interests. If India wished to supplement our arrangements by establishing and maintaining additional appointments to serve India’s special interests, we should have no objection to these appointments being made, and paid for, by India, provided that they were subordinate to and under the general superintendence of our consular officers* Thus, His Majesty’s Government would pay, as in other foreign countries, for diplometic and consular representation in Persia, wherever justified by Imperial interests, and India would pay for additional subordinate posts wherever required by India’s special interests. 8. In practice, this scheme would mean that the Consular Service would have to take over Meshed Consulate-General, and consular posts at Mohammerah, and possibly Kerman. The Government of India might perhaps wish to appoint and pay for a Vice-Consul at Meshed, under the Consul-General, together with subordinate Vice-Consuls at Zabul and Zahidan, also under/7965 i under the Consul-General at Meshed. , * ■&gt; 9* Now that the India Office are aH'S]?' artment of His Majesty’s Government, we feel that expenditure at posts on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf is no longer the direct concern of the Foreign Office. We are concerned, for example, with the question of the transfer of the Residency mainly from its Persian aspect; that is to say, we have, unfortunately, to make it perfectly clear that it will he necessary very shortly to move the Residency out of Persia, hut it is not really the concern of the Foreign Office to deal with the cost of its re-establishment elsewhere. We think that it would he more appropriate in present conditions for the Imperial share of this expenditure to he charged on the vote for India and Burma Services and defended before the Public Accounts Committee by the India Office. 10. It seems to us that the Government of India’s wish to limit their expenditure on diplomatic and consular establishments can be met by a reorganisation of the Persian Consulates on the lines suggested in paragraph 7 above, (which will relieve the Government of India of nearly all their expenditure in Persia,) together/7965 1958 ) together with an understanding that the Government of India shall pay the expenditure incurred at the posts staffed by the Indian Political Service on the Arabian side of the Gulf. 11. I think it would be useful to hold our meeting some day next week if possible, and if you agree perhaps you will kindly let me know by telephone which day you would be ready to come and discuss these problems with us and the Treasury. 12.

Sir Aubrey Metcalfe : (a) There is considerable trade between India and the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf and there are many Indian traders resident in those Ports. There are also a number of British Indian subjects employed by the Oil Company at Bahrein and this num ber is likely to increase if oil is found at other place's on the Arab Coast.

Sir Aubrey Metcalfe : I have no exact information. Mr. S. Satyamurti : Are they in hundreds or thousands ? Sir Aubrey Metcalfe : It is probable they are in hundreds. I can not tell the Honourable Member the number of traders. 1 can obtain the exact information if the Honourable Member wishes. Mr. T. S.

Sir Aubrey Metcalfe : (a) Yes. (b) A settlement in which two parties are involved cannot be decided by unilaterial action on the part of one party to the settlement. The ai rangements for division of expenditure in the Persian Gulf are at present regulated by a Convention arrived at between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in 1904 and this Convention cannot be altered without the consent of both parties. (c) No. The Government of India do not admit that Indian interests in the Persian Gulf are negligible. (d) Does not arise. Mr. S. Satyamurti : With reference to part (b), may I know whether the answer means that while this Government have been doing their best, the delay of nearly eight years after the Public Accounts Committee has made its recommendation is entirely due to His Majesty’s Government’s unwillingness to come to any settlement in this matter ? Sir Aubrey Metcalfe : That, I think, asks me for an expression of opinion. It is not for me to apportion blame between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. Mr. S. Satyamurti : I want to know the facts. I want to know the reasons for the delay and whether the Government of India have been doing their best, or whether they themselves acquiesce in this delay by not pressing the question adequately on the attention of His Majesty’s Government ?

It occurs to us in the first place that the possibility may not be so imminent now that Soheily has been superseded. But I suppose we cannot rule it out altogether on that account. 3. We agree generally with what you say in paragraph 4 about Abu Musa and Tamb, though offhand it seems to us very improbable that the objections we should feel to leasing Tamb to the Persians could be overcome. 4. As regards the move of the Residency, is it not going too far to speak of it as leaving been decide d ? It is true there is general agreement that the move is desirable on political grounds, but the Government of India would not regard themselves as definitely committed until the general financial question has been settled. You will remember writing about 3436^3^- this in your official letter of the 23rd May (E 1 522/461/341 . In the circumstances we could certainly not at present agree that ^ the Minister should say anything that could be regarded by the Persians as in any way committing us to the move to Bahrein. Perhaps we had better wait until the Persians raise the matter, if they should do so. The India Office would then of course like to be consulted as to the reply. Meanwhile we can bear in mind the possibility of its being raised. We suggest therefore that if Seymour receives an enquiry on the point he should in the first instance say that he is referring it home. Possibly/ C.W. Baxter Esq., Foreign Office.Possibly the best eventual reply (though we can consider this if and when the case arises) might be that the desirability of moving the-Resident 1 s headquarters to Bahrein for administrative reasons is already being investigated by His Majesty’s Government. 5. Is there any hope of an early decision on the financial issues raised in our official letter of the 16th March ( P.Z.7546/37) ? Yours sincerely, Sd. R. Peel5.%. 5114/38 COPY OF (ho (E 3987/461/34) FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 19th July, 1938. Dear Peel, I enclose herein an extract from a letter from Butler at Tehran, to Oliphant on the subject of Persian Gulf questions, which as you will see, are likely to be raised by the Persian Government before long. As regards the references mentioned by Butler, copies of Tehran telegram No.78 of the 11th June, of Tehran despatch No.51 of 5th February 1937, and of our telegram to Tehran No.32 of the 5th March, 1937, were sent to you under cover of Foreign Office letters of 18th June, 1938, of 22nd March, 1937 and 6th March, 1937 respectively. 2. It is unfortunate that Soheily is determined to take up Persian Gulf questions with us, since v/e see no basis for an agreement with ^ersia on the questions at issue. 3. The main difficulty is that Persia, as part of any agreement, would be required to give up her claims to Bahrein, Tamb and Abu Musa, and to recognise our special relations with the Arab rulers on the Western side of the Gulf. We can hardly expect Persia to agree to this without at least some counter-concession on our part which the Persian Government could use for face-saving purposes. But there are no suitable counter-concessions which we can give. 4. Soheily probably wishes to obtain Tamb and Abu Musa in return for giving up Persia’s claim to Bahrein. We should hpve to refuse to consider this suggestion, as we have refused to consider it many times before. If he were to make a further suggestion that Persia’s face-saving requirements would be satisfied by being ranted a lease of Tamb, we might consider the question further. But we could not put forward such a proposal without the consent of the owner of the Island, and even then it is very doubtful whether/ R.T. Peel Esq., M.C.f o &gt; ♦ . 2 whether an acceptahle settlement could he reached on this basis. 5. As for the Bushire Residency, Butler asks whether we shall eventually withdraw the Residency (as we withdrew from Henjam and Basidu) without any quid pro quo. The answer, it seems to us, is that we cannot make very much use of our withdrawal from B-q shire as a make-weight in the negotiations, because the Persians can at any moment insist on our withdrawal without any quid pro quo . If we were to try to use our readiness to withdraw the Residency as a bargaining counter in the general negotiations with Persia regarding the Gulf, the Persians would be tempted, if the negotiations were going badly, to call our bluff by insisting n the Residency*s immediate removal. And how would we look then?.* 6. The only point which seems to us to require consideration at the present stage, before Soheily has raised these Gulf questions, is what Seymour, who will shortly be returning to Tehran, must say if and when Soheily raises the question of the removal of the Residency. One possible line of reply would be to say that this is a matter which really need not be discussed, since we have already decided in principle some time ago to move the Residency to Bahrein. The disadvantage of this course would be that it would raise the expectations of the Persian Government; they would at once ask when the Resident was leaving Bushire, and we should thereafter be asked every month or so if we could yet give a date for the Resident*s departure, even if the Persians did not take active steps to make his position intolerable. 7. Another possible line of reply would be for Seymour to say that he knows that the question of removing the Residency was at one time under discussion, but that he does/does not know the result of the consideration which has been given to this question. The disadvantage of this course would he that we should very soon have to make a further communication to the Persians, telling them how the matter does stand, and by that time the Persians might well have formulated a definite demand for the Residency^ removal. We should prob'bly have to rule out the idea that Seymour should allow it to be understood that we have not hitherto considered the question at all, since I understand that our decision to move to Bahrein is very likely known locally. The problem is a difficult one, and we shall be glad if you will kindly let us have your opinion on the best solution. Yours sincerely, Sd. C.W. Baxter(E 3987/461/34) C Identlal . * f Extra ct from letter from fcr« Nrvlle ButX^r (Tehran) No . 539/1/38 datad 15th June, 1933. I have reported in a telegram about the alleged expuleion of Iranians from Bahrein, (Ho. 73 of the 11th June), that Eoheily told me that presently he would have to take up Persian Gulf questions with us. At the Birthday party I said to him something to the effect that happily there was no serious trouble between our two countries. He demurred a little and went on to eay with the greatest geniality that, when he had disposed of various ’questions actuelles’ with other countries that he had found requiring settlement, he would really have to take up Persian Gulf questions with us, and I understood him to say that he realised that it was no good expecting that we would give up Bahrein. I e were then interrupted. BohSlly*s views about the Gulf are discussed in paragraph 4 of Tehran despatch No. 51 of the 5ta February, 1937, and those of His fcajeety’s Government are defined in t’oreign Office telegram No. 32 of the 5th March, 1937. Possibly it is worth thinking now whether anything should be added to them, v e withdrew from Hen.jam and Basidu without any quid pro quo. Ehall we eventually do the same as regards Bushire? In the event of discussions of Gulf questions taking place, we would of course insist on the Iranian Government recognising our special relations with the Sheikhs. I wish that we could, asa m&amp;Ke-weight, (e) promise nithdrawal of the British Residency from Bushire, and (b) give a date and an early one. If a Persian sees his money he gives you an easier price. And I believe that the Shah, who is ageing and in a hurry over everything, would like to see Bushire and Shirax clear of Hesidency traces. In October, 1936, Soheily told me that he had hopes of getting Tamb, and I rather think that Adi said the same to the V inister about Tamb or Bahrein this year. Neither got any encouragement, the Minister replying that we could not make presents of other people 1 s property. I imagine that there would be strong objections to the Sheikh leasing it to the Iranian Government even under strict conditions. Friends in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs tell us that Loheily is wonting very hard and trying to get settlements. He has helped us in the very snail matter of our Berberis in Khorassan. But his energy may flag in the face of Iranian conditions, end very possibly he will not talk about the Gulf again until the Minister is back. I thimc that we must expect him to do so then.on this subject, please quote ! urther communication No. E 1522/461/34. and address— not to any person by name but to— “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office. S.W.l* Foreign Office, 23rd May, 1938* Sir, I am directed 'by Viscount Halifax to request you to inform the Marquess of Zetland that arrangements are being made to examine with all despatch the matters dealt with in your letter No* PZ 7846/37 of the 16th March enclosing a copy of a letter from the Government of India on the subject of the transfer of the Political Residency from Bushire to Bahrein and the connected subject of the apportionment between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India of liability for diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia and in the Persian Gulf area# 2# In the meantime. Lord Halifax is impressed by the fact, as shown in paragraph 2 of your letter, that the Government of India base their views on the question of the transfer of the Residency on the assumption that it is necessitated mainly by British Imperial interests, and that, failing agreement between themselves and His Majesty’s Government on the question, there is nothing to prevent the Residency from being retained indefinitely at Bushire# It is, however, necessary to bear in mind that the continued location of the Residency on Persian soil is dependent on the acquiescence of the Persian Government# Lord Halifax, therefore thinks it desirable at this stage to put on record his considered/ India Officeconsidered opinion, which is shared hy His Majesty s Minister at Tehran, that while it is possible that the Persian G-ovemment will not raise for the present the question of the establishment of the Political Resident in Persia, this cannot be guaranteed; but that, in any case, the whole subject is &gt; certain to be raised whenever it becomes necessary to approach the Persian Government on the subject of appointing a successor to Sir T. Fowle, even though this may not be till the latter part of next year. 3. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Treasury. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, c vo. TV&lt;^&gt;Minute Paper. The Government of India’s letter of the political Department. P. 6775/30 U ~ ^ jj 12th November deals with three connected matters which have hitherto been dealt with more or less independently, viz. the proposed transfer of the Political Residency from Bushire to Bahrain, the claim to a division of the expenditure hitherto borne entirely by the Government of India at Bahrain and Muscat between Imperial and Indian revenues, and the apportionment between H.M.G. and the Government of India of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia. a question that has been discussed at intervals for ten years past. It was actively considered seven years ago in the (unsuccessful) treaty negotiations with Persia, in the course of which the Minister at Tehran made an offer to the Persian Government to transfer the Residency from Persian soil as soon as alternative accommodation was available elsewhere. It was assumed that the Persia^ had strong objections to the location on Persian territory of an officer whose duties were mainly concerned with the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf; and it was hoped that the offer would therefore have a favourable effect on the treaty negotiations. In fact, the Persians neither then nor at any other time seem to have entertained very strong objections to the presence of the Resident at Bushire. The Foreign Office have always urged the proposal to transfer the Residency much more strongly than the Persians have shov/n signs of doing, and for some years they encountered a decided want of enthusiasm on the part of the Government of India and the India Office for the proposed transfer. With the failure of the treaty negotations the proposal fell I. 10,000 9.37 10P ■ Transfer of the Residency to Bahrain . This is into/2 into abeyance for two years from the end of 1933. It was revived at the end of 1935 by the Minister at Tehran during a visit to Delhi and the question was raised officially by the Foreign Office in March 1936. Persian hostility was admitted to be a secondary reason for the transfer, the main ground of which was the growth of imperial interests on the Arab coast (oil, air route, etc. ) v/hich were held to require the location of the Resident on that side of the Gulf. The question was considered by the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee of the C.I.D. on 5th May, 1936, the conclusions reached being that the early transfer of the Residency to Bahrain * was desirable for political reasons, that immediate investigation should be made into the financial aspect, and that the matter should be further considered later in the light of the results of the investigation. Since that date the matter has been investigated by the Political Resident and by an officer of the Indian Public Works Department. The Government of India has said, on the assumption that the cost would be divisible equally between them and H.M.G., they would not be prepared to face a preliminary estimate exceeding 12 lakhs. After much examination the Resident and the P.W.D. expert agreed in October 1936 that the cost be kept within 12 lakhs. This may have assumed that a site would be provided free by the Shaikh of Bahrain; it probably did not cover the cost of a circuit house at Karachi (about £6,000); and it certainly did not cover the matter of accommodation for clericals and menials (v/ho number about 100). There would, hov/ever, be certair. annual savings (about half a lakh) in the cost of telegrams, touring, etc. As for the clericals and menials the Resident considered that there were only two solutions, either for Government to erect the necessary buildings/ P.Z. 1680/36. * K ft r t P.Z.4905/36 P.Z.7633/36 P.Z. 687/37 P.Z.5516/37 P.Z.914/37Minute Paper, Department. . I 3. t buildings, or to arrange in advance that the local landlords should build suitable accommodation. The landlords would however require a guarantee for the payment of rent over a number of years (it was thought they v/ould be satisfied with a guarantee for 15 years). The Government of India refused to consider giving such P. Z. 1149/37 a guarantee; and the Resident said that it v/ould be hopeless, without a previous arrangement v/ith the landlords, to expect that they v/ould be willing to build reasonable houses and charge reasonable rents. The only solution remaining is for Government to provide accommodation, and it is chiefly for this reason that the Government of India now say that the estimated cost of the new Residency will be about Rs. 17-2- lakhs. Of this sum the Government of India are willing to pay up to 6 lakhs, being already more or bss committed to that extent, but 'in no circumstances are they willing to increase it'. We know from private correspondence last summer that the Viceroy had great difficulty in holding the Finance Department to the 6 lakhs, and it may be regarded as quite out of the question to expect that anything more than the 6 lakhs will be forthcoming. The Government of India further make their willingness to pay this sum conditional on acceptance of the scheme they propose for the division of 'diplomatic and consular' expenditure in Persia and the Gulf. The Foreign Office meanwhile continue to urge the need for an early decision on the question of the transfer of the Residency; their P. Z7562/37 latest official letter, dated the 19th November, says 1 that it would be most unfortunate, from the point of view of major imperial interests, if the transfer v/ere delayed for purely financial reasons, and asks for an early «474b Wt 22530/P i ;i44 io,ooo 9.37 iop decision/4 decision 'on the comparatively secondary points of finance which are still outstanding'. It remains to he seen, however, if the Treasury will agree to shoulder al3. the cost in excess of Rs.6 lakhs. It should he added that from our papers it seems that there is very little room left for reducing the present estimate of the cost. The local political authorities, as well as P.W.D. officers, have gone thoroughly into the question, examining such aspects as the possibility of reducing the clerical establishment, amalgamating posts, and planning a building as small as may be consistent with the Resident’s requirements and the dignity of his office. Division of expenditure at Bahrain and Muscat . Hitherto the expenditure on these agencies has been borne entirely by Indian revenues. The Government of India, in their letter of 16th January, 1936, made the claim that in view of the growth of Imperial interests in these territories, H.M.G. should assume liability for half the expenditure. The Foreign Office were officially addressed on the matter in India Office letter of the 6th November, 1936, to which no official reply has been received. The views of the Foreign Office on the manner in which H.M.G. might be willing to meet the claim a re embodied in Mr. Rendel’s demi-official letter of the 32th October dealing with the question of expenditure generally in Persia and the Gulf.

After the war India attempted to secure a readjustment of incidence on the ground that Imperial and Indian interests had come to bear a proportion different from what had obtained in 1900. The leading papers of the correspondence are:- Government of India’s despatch of 13th July, 1922 (P.3135/22) India Office letter to Foreign Office of 7th March 1923 (P.3135/22) Foreign Office letter to India Office of 14th July 1924 (P.2959/24) Government of India’s despatch of 8th October, 1925, (P.3660/25) India Office letter to Foreign Office of 22nd Nov.1926 (P.3460/26) Lord Birkenhead’s letter to Sir A.Chamberlain of 4th April, 1927, and Sir A.

For a convenient summary of the history of the subject reference may be made to the brief pugpared for Lord Birkenhead in March 1927. It may also be found convenienl to recite here the outlines of the various proposals whiclj have been put forward since 1922 dov/n to the Government o: India’s present letter. They are as follows Government of India’s proposals. July 1922 (put to Foreiim Office. March 1925) . The ratio of British to Indian interests in Persia had changed since 1900 and was such as to justify a redivision of financial liability by which India would pay only one-third of Persian d. and c. expenditure. To avoid perpetuating the administrative disadvantages inherent in any system of divided control India proposed that the Consulates in Southern and Easte: Persia, v/hich were staffed by India, should be maintained wholly at India’s cost, and that India should pay one- third of the cost of Bushire and the Tehran Legation.

That arrangements should be made gradually to replace all officers of the Indian Service at Consular posts in Persia (except possibly Bushjre) by Levant service Officers, that entire responsibility for maintenance should be assumed by the Foreign Office as each transfer takes place, and that the Government of India should pay, in full discharge of their liability, an annual contribution. The existing total cost was estimated at £138,000 of which the Foreign Office estimated they paid £66,000. They were not prepared to pay anything more. But they calculated that the ultimate effect of their proposals (leaving Bushire unaffected) would be a reduction of the total expenditure to £116,000. India's contribution v/ould therefore be eventually reduced to £50,000.

No reference was made to expenditure at Kuwait, Bahrain or Muscat. Effect of the proposal: Foreign Office would pay £73,377 instead of £66,000; India v/ould pay £61,357 instead of £69,000. Sir A.Chamberlain refused to accept the proposal, describing it as practically identical v/ith the India Office proposal of March 1923. The financial issue was to him a minor consideration. V/hat v/orried the Foreign Office was a fear of the risk of increasing Indianisation of the Political Department, and therefore of the danger that Indians might be appointed to consular posts in Persia. He pointed to India f s illogical position in claiming that Indian interests in Persia did not exceed one-third, and at the same time claiming retention of the patronage of a number of important consulates. Further, India asserted only a one-third interest in Bushire and yet wished to retain the very expensive arrangement of staffing the Residency from India. Why not hand it over to the Levant Service?

India would then he responsible for all expenditure on the Residency, Kuwait, and Zahidan, while the Foreign Office would be responsible for all expenditure in Persia (except on the Zahidan Vice Consulate). At the same time the Foreign Office would waive their claim to the existing contributions in respect of Siam etc. included at present in the annual settlement. According to the Foreign Office calculations, when their plan reaches its full effect India would save £17,000, since her present share of the shared expenditure, viz. £61,000, would be reduced to the full cost of the Residency, the Kuv/ait Agency, and the Zahidar. Vice-Consulate, viz. £44,000. This saving of £17,000 would be regarded as H. M.

November 1957 . The proposals are aimed at 'defining, limiting and stabilising ' their future financial liabilities towards Iran and the Persian Gulf. They proceed on the basis that H.M.G. accept liability for half the expenditure at Bahrain and Muscat. India propose that their share of expenditure in Persia and the Gulf (including Bahrain and Muscat) should, be fixed at a lump sum contribution to H.M.G. and stabilised at that sum for an initial period of 5 years, after which it could be reviev/ed and if necessary refixecL.

Roughly speaking, on the Government of India’s figures the total diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia and on the Arabian coast of the Gulf is £136,000, X f of which H. M. G. pay £56,000 and India £80,000,. The Government of India’s proposal would therefore transfer /C a liability for £12,500 from Indian to Imperial revenues. No reference is made in the Government of India’s letter to the possibility of their being willing to transfer any of their Persian posts to the Foreign Office. The Viceroy told the Secretary of State privately in August that he was 'definitely of opinion that we ought not to relinquish our present degree of control of the Eastern Consulates, or our present interest in them'. It may be of course that the Government of India are affirming this view when postulating the condition that there should be no change in existing administrative arrangements. (The Persian consulates - other than Bushire -now 10,000 9J37 10P staffed from India are:- Consulate/10. Consulate General,.. Meshed Consulate, Kerman Superior posts Vice-Consulate, Zabul ii it ii i» ti ti Zahidan Bandar Abbas Khorramshahr Possibly all, except Khorramshar, are covered by the term ’’Eastern Consulates”. ) It v/ill have been seen from the forqgping summary that the proposals recently put forward in Mr. Rendel’s demi-official letter of the 12th October are similar to those advanced by the Foreign Office in July 1924. Thei:? essential feature is that India’s claim to a reduction in her liability should be met by her withdrawal from the consular posts at present staffed from the Indian service. Owing to the smaller salaries paid to Levant Service officers and to the smalhr establishments generally attached to them, the posts staffed from India are substantially more expensive than those manned by the Foreign Office. But the possibility of a reduced total expenditure, and of wider prospects for the employment of Levant Service officers, has probably v/eighed less with the Foreign Office than the fear that a most awkward situation might arise if, as the result of increasing Indianisation of the Indian Political Service, the Government of India, perhaps as the result of direct pressure from Indian opinion, should attempt to insist on filling one of the Persian posts by an Indian, whose mere nationality would probably make him quite unacceptable to the Persians. The danger does not seem to have increased since 1924, but it can hardly be argued, in view of constitutional developments, that it has receded. However, as stated above, the Viceroy has reaffirmed the view that India ought not to relinquish her/Minute Paper.

There is therefore no reason to suspend action on the Government of India’s letter in order to ascertain their viev/s on the latest Foreign Office scheme The Government of India’s proposals have at any rate the merit of making a fresh approach in their suggestion that India’s liability should be stabilised at a fixed figure over a period of five years. It can hardly be expected, however, that the Foreign Office and the Treasury will be disposed to accept them - unless the Foreign Office are really so keen on the transfer of the Residency that they think the price worth paying. The proposals would increase H.M.G. *s liability by £12,500. They offer no contribution to a reduction in total expenditure which would follow from the transfer to the Levant Service of some at any rate of the posts now staffed by India. Nor will there result any reduction in the burden of the present accounting arrangements and the discussion of 'fresh items of expenditure.

At first sight it might appear too late for the Government of India to attach any conditions to their offer to meet expenditure up to 6 lakhs on the buildings, hut apparently the Foreign Office themselves think the present a suitable opportunity for reviewing the whole question and arriving at a new arrangement for the division of diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia. It is, I think, difficult not to sympathise with what I understand to be the Treasury and Foreign Office view, that if India wishes to staff the Consulates, etc., with more expensive Indian personnel, India should be willing to pay something for the privilege. If Indian officials were required merely to protect the interests of local Indian populations, I ishould imagine that in present circumstances political opinion in India would have no objection to meeting the cost. There has been a considerable development ofMinute Paper Department. &gt;00 3 37 local Indian representation outside India since 1922, e.g. in South Africa.

Diplomatic and Consular expenditure are preferred two years/years in arrear and the Government of India have therefore budgetted for the normal expenditure during this financial year. 3. As regards figures these have been examined as far as is possible but as the costs of Bahrein and Muscat do not appear in the Diplomatic and Consular adjustments with the Foreign Office the figures for these posts together with those relating to Civil Works and leave and pension contributions generally cannot be checked. While the final result arrived at is probably approximately correct it may be worth while to mention that the figure of Rs.3,54, ; 232 in respect of Bushire in 1935- 6 is about Rs.13,000 less than the actual sum included in the Diplomatic and Consular accounts after making adjustments,e.g. for Civil Wor^scorresponding , to those made in the Government of India’s figure for the previous year. The reason for the reduction of about Rs.4,000 in the figure for the Iranian Legation for 1936- 7 is also obscure. This reduction is not shown in the Government of India’s Revised Estimate in Appendix I to ’Demands for Grants for 1937-8’. 4. A point arises also in regard to the figures for Civil Works. Owing to the exclusion of Bahrein and Muscat costs from the Diplomatic and Consular accounts it is not clear whether the figures for Civil Works now furnished by India, vide paragraph 11, include the cost to India of new works, if any: paragraphs 8 and 9 rather the moiety figure of Rs.9.15 lakhs (or Rs.9.10 lakhs after excluding the cost of the Zahidan Trade Agent). It is also possible that capital expenditure incurred at establishments not in the sphere of the Public works suggest that they do not and in such case, as these costs are not divisible,t he y should have been added in full to . , _ Department/'Vtv*. * A 4 -, LCcnso*-^' Minute Paper.

The saving to Indian Revenues would appear likely to , ^ exceed the sum of £12,500 mentioned in the minute Doth in view of the considerations advanced in the preceding paragraphs and also for the following reason: the total expenditure of £156,000 taken as the basic figure is made up of Indian expenditure £95,000 and foreign Office expenditure £41,000. The former includes charges si&gt;ecified \ z y 00 L under Bahrein and Muscat of £21,000 hut also leave tfu re 'contrihution charges relative to those posts estimated hy this Department to amount to £2,500. Hence on the existing basis the divisible figure is £112,500 allocable roughly India £57,250 Foreign Office £55,250. Adding to the Indian figure the Bahrein and Muscat charges of £23,500 the total at present borne by Indian Revenues is £80,750 and accordingly an offer to pay £67,500 would involve a saving of £13,250. To this should presumably be added the contribution of £487.10.- relating to Iran referred to in the final paragraph of the Government of India letter. 6. On a point of detail it must not be overlooked that the savings referred to at A on page 8 of the minute, under Foreign Office plan, October 1937, would, as far as the contributions relate to Siam posts, accrue to Burma and not India. ^ G/l * Utcr) 3939 5000 7/35 /!/'// 3 2 kxtk te W- * wjt ih luw ctcA* u. ur4U 1U.

The F.O. proposal, however, would not meet the G. of I.’s desiderata under (2) and (3) above. Though the Viceroy is anxious to retain the staffing of the E. Persian consulates, it is a question whether the advantage of these posts to India is comnensurate with their cost. Persian administration is now so centralised at Tehran that it is becoming more and more difficult for the Consuls to perform useful functions. I believe that Sir T. Fowle was inclined to the view that it would really pay Indian interests better to have an officer attached (with the status perhaps of Counsellor) to the Legation at Tehran. In the draft letter we link with the G. of I.’s main proposal their offer to pay Rs .6 lakhs for the transfer of the Residency as being conditional oh the former. But the G. of I. are, as a fact, so committed to the principle of moving the Residency, and to the suggested payment, that it will be difficult in the last resort to insist on the condition. t It should not be overlooked that, as regards Persia, the apportionment of expenditure in approximately equal shares results in the transfer every year of a considerable sum from British/ar£ &amp;&gt;0s'!f A* ’C i+'lfc* yyi+t ) -V British to Indian revenues. This is due to the fact that the Indian service personnel in the posts staffed from India is more expensive than the Levant service personnel in the posts staffed by the F.O. It is this fact which makes the Treasury and the F.O. discontented with the present arrangement and leads them to favour taking over the posts staffed from India. Consequently, while Indian public opinion deprecates the expenditure of Indian money on representation in Persia and tends to minimise or ignore the resulting benefit to Indian interests, the arguments are by no means all on one side in regard to an arrangement which, quite apart from the political and commercial interests involved, results in H.M.G. contributing half the cost of maintaining a number of highly paid Indian-service officers. The G. of I. set great store by their proposal to stabilise their present expenditure at a contract sum for a term of years - 'It is the indefiniteness and the unlimited extent of their possible financial liabilities under the present system which gives the G. of I. the greatest concern, and which they are most anxious to ♦ remove.' This expression of their fears of any great expansion/expansion of expenditure seems somewhat exaggerated. In Persia the tendency has been definitely to a reduction instead of an expansion in recent year^t It is c true that on the Arab shore of the Crulf British interests are growing apace, but this does not necessarily mean any great expansion of expenditure from Indian revenues; new expenditure on specific projects, such as the air route and the transfer of the Naval station from Henjam to Bahrein, has been met from British revenues; the growing importance of Bahrein may require additional British personnel in the service of the Sheikh, but these of course would be paid by Bahrein, though they might be drawn from India; items, such as the appointment of an additional assistant Political Agent or an additional Medical Officer, are the only matters likely to lead to additional Indian expenditure^if India continues to staff and pay for the Agencies. It will clearly not be easy to get H.M.G. to agree to pay half the expenditure on the Arab shore (and, moreover, the whole of any additional expenditure there) while the G. of I. continue (as they are anxious to do) to staff all the posts, to have complete control of administration and the major share of the control of policy. It/It may be desirable to bear some of the above points in mind, as it would be a mistake not to realise that there are strong points in the Treasury case. As a first step, however, it is submitted that we should address the F.O. as in the attached draft, supporting the 0. of I.*s plan, with a view at any rate to startirg a discussion; the F.O. and Treasury may then counter with their own plan (which we have not yet received officially); when we receive the F.O. reply we can consider the best procedure for seeking a solution of the question, whether by conference or otherwise. ' h- y 3/In the course of the discussion with the F.O. and Treasury they will no doubt make proposals on the lines of those already foreshadowed in Mr. Rendel T s d.o. letter. The Secretary of State considers that in forwarding such proposals for the views of the G. of I. we might take the opportunity of asking the latter to consider the question of the value to India of the posts in East Persia which the G. of I. man, and the question whether it would not be to our advantage to surrender them, or some of them, to the F. O. if the latter would agree in exchange to an officer of the G. of I. being selected for some post, such as that of Counsellor, at Tehran; a point for the G. of I.'s consideration in this connection would be whether such direct representation at Tehran would not be of greater service to them in safeguarding Indian interests in East Persia, in view of the fact that the Persian administrative machinery is now so highly centralised.Draft Paper. , -so P.Z.7846/37 The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. / / 12 th Nc^f. ^04 ei****+*Ai&lt;4 lu ihuvtj. 7Z, ^ \h Department. 16 MAR 1938 Sir, tfith reference to the correspondence resting with your letter of the 19th Nov., No.E.6092/649/34» I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, a copy of a letter dated 12th Nov. 1937&gt; from the Government of India on the subject of the transfer of the Political Residency from Bushire to Bahrein and on the connected subject of the apportionment betw r een His Majesty 1 s Government and the Government of India of liability for diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia and in the Persian Gulf area. Copj^ of a supplementary d.o. letter dated 24th Nov. 1937 also enclosed. 2. It will be seen that, in consequence of the necessity to build accommodation forj the clerical and .menial staff, the estimated cost of the proposed Residency is now stated to be about Rs.l7i lakhs. The Government of India, who consider the move of the Residency to be financially unjustifiable at this figure but are ready to acquiesce in the transfer if His Majesty Government regard it in the light of imperial interests as an essential measure, are prepared to contribute to the cost up to the amount to which they regard themselves to be already committed, and subject/ 1 6474A Wt 22530/P 144 10,000 9.37 IOP (subject to the condition referred to below, They state that the sum of Rs.6 lakhs is the utmost that they are willing to pay in any circumstances, and havingregard to the reluctance with which this figure has been agreed to, and to the views held by the Government of India upon the question of any necessity for transferring the Residency from Bushire, the Secretary of State is not prepared to urge the Governmeijit of India to make any increase in their promised contribution. 3* As regards this question of the transfer of the Residency the Marquess of Zetland does not overlook that in their express letter of 6th April 1936 the Government of India were inclined to agree that,on grounds mainly of administrative convenience, the balance of advantage was in favour of the transfer, but subject always to financial considerations. The conclusion^ of the Middle East Committee was that for political reasons the early move of the Residency was desirable, but that the matter should be further considered after the financial implications had been examined. Lord Zetland also appreciates thewider political considerations mentioned cf tl*e . in para.3 of your letter under reply. He suggests, however, that in so far as the transfer of the Residency to the Arab side of the Gulf might be of advantage in connection, for example, with Anglo-Saudi relations, such advantages are mainly a matter/6474a Wt 22530/P 144 10,000 &lt;j.37 IOP that/ Draft Paper Department matter of Imperial, as distinct from specifically Indian interests. He accordingly feels that, having regard to the various reasons for which it is desired to transfer the Residency and the nature of the mere important interests Involved, the RsUS lakhs offered hy the G&gt;of L towards the cos^ would he a fair ; and even a generous, contribution, and he trusts that XX• Lord Halifax saxxrfc&amp;aryxxjiKXL and the L.G. of h-M.T. will agree that it may be so regarded. 4- The Government of India make their willingness to contribute to the cost of the new Residency to the extent of Rs.6 lakhs conditional upon the acceptance of proposals now put forward by them v/ith the object of defining and stabilising their liability to bear a share of the diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia and in the Persian Gulf area. In the years that have passed since this subject was last under the active consideration of His Majesty 1 s Government the growth of Imperial rela-t-Lve ta Indian interests has increased both in Persia ancT^particularly on the Arab coast of the Gulf. The reasons which moved the Government of India in 1922 to clarm a revision in their favour of the division of expenditure resulting from the recommendations of the Welby Commission have become increasingly strong, and Lord Zetland agrees with the Government of India that the time has come to propose.f that the position should he re-examined by His Majesty’s Government. 5* The Government of India, in formulating their own proposals, proceed or. the assumption that the proposal which they have already made that expenditure on the Bahrain and Muscat Agencies, at present borne entirely by India, should be shared equally between Indian and Imperial revenues will be accepted by His Majesty’s Government. Their viev/s on this matter were supported by Lord Zetland in the letter addressed to you on the 6th Nov. * 1936, No. P.Z.7103/36. On the assumption, therefore, that^their present liability for expenditure in Persia and the Gulf area *L)L&lt; ^ MU, limited in principle to one half.the Government of India, with a view to setting a limit to their expenditure over the next five years (a point to which, as will be seen from their letter^they attach great importance), propose that their liability should be fixed at an annual lump sum contribution in respect of expenditure in Persia and on the Arab shore of the Gulf for that period, and that all expenditure whatever, whether on capital or on revenue account, in excess of that sum (with the exception, of course, of expenditure on the construction of the new Residency towards which tney will contribute up to Rs.6 lakhs; should be a charge on Imperial revenues. Taking the average rate of expenditure for the last three years for which accounts A are/Draft Paper Department 6837 Wt 34001/249 10,000 1.38 are available they propose that the contractual sum should be fixed for five years at Rs.9 lakhs, or £67,500 per annum, being approximately half the total expenditure. In return for their undertaking to make a contribution on this scale the G. of I. would expect that no change in the present administration or administrative over that policy and over general policy would be made. 6 . For the reasons set forth in the G. of I.'s letter, Lord Zetland would commend the proposals to Lord Halifax’s favourable consideration and trusts I that it will be found possible to urge their acceptance upon the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. 7.

In the last column of the statement accompanying the letter, the figure relating to Zahidan should be 3,000 instead of 3,675, as the latter figure included the cost of the Trade Agent, which should really be excluded since this is borne entirely by India, not being a diplomatic and consular expenditure. The references to the Zahidan Trade Agency in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the letter may also be deleted. The totals both in paragraph 11 and in the statement attached will also require amendment so as to exclude the figure of £675 from the calculations.

S Transfer of the Bushire Residency to Bahrein * n\jA -v { With reference to the correspondence ending with IMx. Secretary of State*s telegram No.784, dated the 8 th &gt; l March 1937, I am directed to say that it is non estimated that the cost of the proposed Residency at Bahrein will be about Ks.l7i- lakhs. The increase in the estimate is largely due to the fact that it has been found that it will be impossible to obtain accomnodation for the clerical staff locally and that it will therefore be necessary to build quarters for them. 2 . The Government of India have already stated in their telegram to the Secretary of State for India, No .1539« dated the 9th July 1936, that they are most unwilling to conriit themselves to expenditure of more than Rs .6 lakhs on the new Residency, and in fact they regret that they agreed to contribute even this amount. The move of the Residency is dictated predominantly by Imperial interests, vide paragraphs 3 and 4 of the despatch from the Foreign Office to the India Office, l(e r &gt; rr ■ 1 k '!j»a u* • “ * j ; WO/1937 * INDIA OFir \Cc.

In fact, the Grovernment of India consider that the move is not financially justifiable at all at the figure of 17i lakhs. As, however, they have already agreed to contribute up to Rs .6 lakhs, they will make this sum available, but in no circumstances are they willing to increase it. They would also make their agreement to provide this sum, subject to the condition that His Majesty's Government accept the scheme described in later paragraphs of this letter for the future settlement of the question of incidence of expenditure in Iran and the Persian Gulf. Before, therefore, proceeding further with the new Residency and forwarding detailed estimates, as requested in the telegram under reference, the Government of India will be glad to know whether His Majesty's Government will accept the condition stated above and will bear all expenses on the scheme in excess of the sum specified. 3. While examining the incidence of the cost of the proposed newResidency, the Government of India have felt impelled to review their financial liabilities in Iran and the Persian Gulf generally. As the Secretary of State is aware, the Government of India have been endeavouring for many years to secure a revision of the present arrangements governing the division of expendi ture in Iran and the Persian Gulf on the general ground that Indian interests therein do not justify a charge on Indian revenues of more than one half of the expenditure concerned. Officially this question rests with the Government of India Despatch No # 10 of 1925 to which no final reply has been received. It may conveniently be considered to have begun with the Government of India Despatch/- 3 - P ( }Ji ^ f ^0) Despatch No # 5 of 1922 in which the following points were raade:- (a) that the division of expenditure by any rule of proportion involved grave danger to Indian finances, particularly when a conflict of interests^arose between the two partieso Thus, some £ 6 millions had been debited to Indian revenues, to a considerable extent without either her knowledge or concurrence, over a period of 6 years, representing expenditure which could not be considered as falling within the scope of Diplomatic and Consular services, (b) that Indian interests in Iran and the Persian Gulf had declined, and Imperial interests had increased to such an extent that a division of the relevant expenditure in moieties between the two Governments was no longer a just proportion, (c) that in consequence the best course to adopt was to abandon a distribution of the whole expenditure by arithmetical proportion and generally to allocate full liability for specific interests to the Government claiming them, or responsible for them, on a terri* torial basis. 4. In their letter to the IndiaOffice, No. ^ D•6771/480/34, dated the 14th July 1924, the Foreign Office of His Majesty's Government reached the conclusion that it would be impossible to arrive at a precise arithmetical proportion representing the magnitude of the respective interests in Iran of the India and Imperial Governments. They put forward the proposal that administrative control over the Consulates in Iran should rest in them, and that the Government of India should pay an annual sum of £ 50,000/- fixed for five years 'in di scharge/- 4 - discharge of their financial responsibility for expenditure on the Diplomatic and Consular services in Iran*. This proposal was not acceptable to the Govern- o ment of India for the reasons given in their Despatch been made. In the meantime, however, direct Indian interests in Iran and the Persian Gulf have declined of Persian Gulf expenditure from Indian revenues has gained further strength and can no longer be ignored. The Government of India consider that the passing of the Government of India Act, 1935, renders it imperative that the question be reviewed afresh, and that some decision be reached in the matter which will be and make some concession to, the strength of Indian feeling against the present arrangement. 6 . The proposal to transfer the Residency from Bushire to Bahrein is an instance of that conflict of interest between the two Governments which the Despatch oi 1922 showed to be a grave danger to Indian finances. It is a matter of indifference to the Government of India whether the transfer takes place or not. If the scheme eventuates,the Government of India will have paid six lakhs of rupees for no appreciable value received, and will be required to endeavour to justify this expenditure in the face of the serious criticism it is likely to evoke from popular Indian opinion. Under the existing financial arrangement further demands of a like nature may arise at any time (as they arose in ths past), and v —’ v No.lO of 1925 and the recommendations contained in ^ their Despatch No.5 of 1922 were repeated. 'll- 5. Since then no progress with this problem has still further, and opposition in India to the continuance acceptable to both Governments, but which will recognise, it/it is this indefiniteness and the unlimited extent of their possible financial liabilities under the present concern and which they are most anxious to remove. The proposals which follow aim particularly at defining, limiting and stabilising the Government of India’s future financial liabilities towards Iran and the Persian Gulf, and I am to invite His Majesty’s Government to give them their early and most earnest consideration. 7. The proposals which follow proceed on the assumption that the request of the Government of India for relief in respect of one-half of the present expenditure on Bahrein and Muscat which was put forward in their letter No .F.546.IV/33, da ted the 16th January 1936, to the 8 . Broadly speaking, the present financial arrange and the Government of India incur in Iran and the Persian Gulf over and above the expenditure respectively so incurred in 1900-01 is shared in equal proportions.

Statements are enclosed giving details of the relevant charges over the last three yeans for which figures are available. Earlier figures are of no assistance as they show wide fluctuations from year to year. These figures have been (and still are) the subject of a great deal of meticulous accounting and discussion, 10, The Government of India propose that their share of expenditure in Koweit, Iran and the Gulf and their share (presumed to be one-half) of the expenditure in Bahrein, Muscat aad -the Zahidan Trade Agency, should be fixed at a lump sum contribution to the revenues of His Majesty's Government, and should be stabilised at that sum for an initial period of five years, after which it would be reviewed and if necessary refixed. Any expenditure whatever, whether on capital or revenue account, over and above this sum,would be a charge on the revenues of His Majesty's Government. The sum should be fixed on the basis of current charges now being incurred on Diplomatic and Consular representation. The Government of India do not propose, during the initial quinquennial period, to press for any substantial X j ^ 4 ( k t „u. HHC-, reduction in the total amount of their present liability ^ vry C/ ^ the matter. They would in return expect that no chanre tu, in the P reaent administration or administrative policy »or in the location of the control over that policy and over general policy would be made. They contemplate, ih/in fact, no change in any of the existing arrangements. Their present object is to limit and stabilise their liabilities. They would continue to maintain the accounts of the areas in question and would furnish His Majesty's Government with an annual statement in detail of the charges incurred, together with an annual claim for reimbursement of expenditure incurred in excess of the contractual sum* 11. In order to determine the amount at which the contractual sum should be fixed, the Government of India have taken into consideration the charges incurred during the last three years for which figures are available, and, after adjusting them as in the statement enclosed for charges no longer incurred (e.g*, the arms traffic subsidy of 1 lakh per annum to Muscat), have arrived at the following broad estimate of what might be considered as normal charges in respect of each Consulate or -Agency:- Indian expenditure (excluding pay cut Foreign and special non- Office recurring items), expenditure (Average for 1932-33 to 1934-35). £ £ Persian Legation... 325 Shiraz ... 100 Bushire ... 26,950 Ahwaz ... 175 Mohanmerah (Khorramshar) 3,200 Bandar Abbas ... 2,800 Kerman ... 1,975 Meshed (Khorasan).. 12,950 Zahidan 3 ,r&lt;T© -^3,675 20,500 2,200 1,600 2,800 Koweit/Leave, passage and pension contrioutions and Ster ling Overseas Pay- Mi scellaneous Charges (Telegrams and Statio nery Supplies, etc.) Civil works Ispahan Tehran, Resht and Ramadan Tabriz Kermanshah Non-effective Services Less fees, etc. 12,675 2,350 3,600 ]5 t S] S' 96*250- 1,100 4,700 1.500 2.500 2,500 2,100 2,500 (-) 3,100 41,000 287 Total...£ 13^250.

Sir, rf It will be within the recollection of the Secretary of State for India that on the 5th May 1936 it was agreed by the Middle East Official Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence 'that, for political reasons, the early move 'of the 'Political Residency from Bushire to Bahrein is 'desirable.' Since that date the question of the early transfer of the Residency to the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf has formed the subject of considerable official and semi official correspondence and oral discussion, but the nrogress made has not been of a nature sufficient to give practical effect to the recommendation of the Middle East Official Sub committee . 2, Mr, Secretary Eden is well aware of the financial difficulties which have complicated the execution of this most necessary political measure. These have in fact formed the subject of separate correspondence, and notably of Sir Robert Vansittart's letter of the 26th July last to Sir Fiadlater Stewart. But in Mr. Eden f s ooinion the political imnortance of this tronsfer is such that it would be most unfortunate, from the point of view of major imperial interests, if it were involved are on a scale and of an imnortance out of all comparison with the expenditure which the move would entail, more especially when it is remembered that, once the Residency ■■■■■ (gfreiuUndqr-Secretary of State, f SSftk NL DEPT. I India Office.e has been effectively estaDlished at Bahrein, very considerable econonues over such matters as journeys, telegrams, recess, etc. are likely to !e effected. 3. Meanwhile, the importance of establishing on the Arab coast the headquarters of the chief British political authority m the Persian Gulf is steadily increasing. As Lord Zetland is aware, the nositicn and prestige of His Majesty’s Government in the Arabian countries and in the Arabian Peninsula are seriously threatened as a result of recent developments in Palestine. Certain European countries, notably Italy and Germany, are making a determined effort io establish their influence in Araoia at the expense of the position and interests of His Majesty's Government. Much may depend cn the attitude of King Ibn Gaud of Saudi Arabia during the next few years and on the course cf his relations with His Majesty’s Government not least on his eastern frontier, and in so far as those relations are likely tc affect the position of the Arab principalities of the Persian Gulf which are in special treaty relations with this country. The rapid development cf oil at Bahrein, and the grant of a series of oil concessions along the whole length of the Arab coast of the ^ian Gulf, constitute a further reason for strengthening British representation on that coast of the Gulf without further delay. Moreover it is easy to visualise eventualities - such as the death or disappearance of Ibn Baud - where it would become a matter of great importance that His Majesty’s Government should be strongly and permanently represented in this area, and that the chief British political authority concerned should not be resident at a distance from scene of action and j.n a foreign country. 4. Apart from this, Mr. Eden views wncn the greatest the misgiving/misgiving any unnecessary continuance of the nresent anomalous and somewhat humiliating position in which the Political Resident, whose interests and responsibilities are almost entirely concerned with the Arabian coast of the Gulf, continues to reside under the somewhat thin disguise of a Consul-General on the* soil of a foreign country where his presence is notoriously embarrassing and unwelcome. Although Mr. j^den does not wish to attach undue imoortance to Persian susceptibilities, the fact that the Persian Government so strongly resent the continued nresence of the Residency as such on Persian soil does, in his view, add considerably to the difficulty of establishing Anglo-Persian relations on a satisfactory basis, and exnoses His Majesty’s Government to a constant risk of being obliged, as the result of Persian action, to carry out an enforced and humiliating evacuation. 5. There are the strongest political reasons, from the point of view of British relations both with Arabia and with Persia, in carrying out this move with the least possible delay. 6. I am therefore to exnress Mr. Eden’s earnest hope that Lord Zetland will be willing strongly to press the Government of India to do whatever may be possible to expedite a decision on the comparatively secondary points of finance which are still outstanding, in order that the necessary arrangements may be made to proceed with the execution of the transfer at a very early date.

I am most grateful to you for your help about Persian Gulf expenditure.

We have some misgivings about agreeing to meet any fixed proportion of the cost of posts over the staffs and maintenance of which we cannot expect to exert direct financial/ J. C. Walton, Es cj_., C.B., M.C. 130011937' ■ - ■ --'-TICE■■..r '—* i— (59 financial control. This is the system of the Welhy Agreement, which has not proved a very satisfactory instrument in Persia, and which should not, we feel, be extended further in the Persian Gulf unless it is clear that no better system can be found. I need not enter into details beyedd mentioning by way of example that in Persia India *s expenditure grew from £23,894 in 1900 to £61,624 in 1934, while that of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom grew from £21,789 to £42,808 in the same period; and that in 1934 (the latest year for which we have comparable figures) the 'Levant” Consulate at Ahwaz cost £2,700 a year while the subordinate 'India' vice-consulate at Khorramshahr cost £3,000 a year. 3. In addition, while we might possibly agree in principle to accept half the expenditure at Bahrain (including Qatar and the Trucial Coast) we are not yet convinced that the interests of His Majesty’s Government in Muscat v/ould justify our going so far in that case. 4. We feel in fact that the Government of India’s present request, combined with the forthcoming move of the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf from Bushire to/•=*•3 Bahrain, affords an eminently suitable occasion for a complete overhaul of the arrangements for staffing the posts and sharing the expenditure in Persia and on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf, with the double object of removing the disadvantages of dual control in Persia and meeting to some extent the desire of the Government of India to reduce their expenditure in these regions* 5. Our proposal (which is not a new one) is,briefly, that, as a preliminary to a financial settlement, we should all tackle boldly the question of the transfer to the Foreign Office of the Consulates in Persia (not including of course the Political Residency - which we hope and trust will soon be moved - and with a possible exception at Zahedan) now under the control of the Government of India, and should try to reach an agreement in principle to effect their transfer as and when convenient opportunities occur (e.g* when their existing incumbents become due for other appointments and the Foreign Office are simultaneously in a position to furnish suitable officers to take their place - which they could not/not as it happens do right away owing to lack of numbers in the consular service). As each post was transferred to the Foreign Office we would take over full responsibility for maintaining it at our own sole expense, (i.e* it would be removed altogether from the sphere of shared expenditure), and for the purpose of further simplification we would also, when the last transfer had taken place, waive our claim to the existing contributions from India for Siam, etc.,now included in the annual settlement. 6. According to our calculations, the adjustment of expenditure in 1934-5 (India Office letter A.G.1009/37 M.I of the 4th March, 1937) resulted in a final net cost to India in respect of the 'shared” areas (i.e. Persia, Kuwait and, within certain limits, Siam) of some £61,000, and it may be assumed that this figure is fairly representative of a normal year’s expenditure by India under the existing system of dividing expenditure. As soon as the transfer of posts outlined in the preceding paragraph had taken full effect, the present system of sharing expenditure would be terminated and the position of/ _■I iJ eA JJ lA*9 . ly. of the Government of India in respect of what is at present shared expenditure would then he that their responsibility would be confined to the Political Residency wherever situated (as distinct from the Bushire Consular post), the Zahedan Vice-Consulate (for which, we admit, a Vice-Consul from India seems necessary, at any rate for some time), and the Agency at Kuwait, the total cost being, according to our reckoning, some £44,000 a year. 7. The annual saving to India of £17,000 would be regarded as our contribution to a final settlement of the entire question of division of expenditure, including any share which we might be willing to pay of the expenditure at the Bahrain and Muscat Agencies. If such a settlement were reached, no payment in adjustment of shared expenditure would be necessary, and we should all be relieved of the wearisome and wasteflil business of prior consultation and subsequent accounting between the two Governments. 8. Although our proposal is simple enough in itself, there are certain points in the preceding paragraphs/paragraphs upon which some additional comments are possibly desirable. 9. To start with the Residency. In the present letter I take it for granted that it is now definitely settled that the Residency is to be transferred to Bahrain as soon as possible and that all that is holding the transfer up is the provision of the necessary finance. So far as the mere arithmetic of our scheme is concerned it does not particularly matter whether the transfer takes place sooner or later (although there will, I believe and as we have so often urged, be substantial savings when once the Residency has been established at Bahrain, in such matters as telegrams, journeys etc., all of v/hich will under our scheme accrue to the Government of India alone). But from other points of view, we are, as you know, most anxious that the point shall be reached at the earliest possible moment where we can state publicly that the transfer will take place as soon as alternative accommodation can be provided. Every day that passes carries with it the risk of some incident which will lead to a formal demand by the Persian/Persian Government for withdrawal, and, if the Persian Government get their word in first, the whole effect of our departure will he spoilt. Instead of going with dignity and because it is our own wish to do so, we shall go, or seem to go, because the Persians are turning us out. We sincerely hope that as a part of the general settlement it will be possible to reach an early decision about the question of accommodation and thereby pave the way for a public announcement. You know our views too well on this question of the Residency for it to be necessary for me to labour them further here. I should add, however, that our proposal does not in any way invalidate our undertaking to pay half the initial cost of establishing the Residency at Bahrain. 10. The question of the Residency leads naturally to that of the '’India” Consulates. We are well aware that this question is one of some delicacy and that is the main reason why we are writing semi-officially instead of officially. We do not want to rush either the India Office or the Government of India, but we feel that the question cannot be shelved indefinitely, and that the present/present moment, when the whole question of the division of expenditure has been raised by the Government of India, is the time to face it. I will not enter now into the reasons why we think this change desirable. They are, as you know, almost entirely political and indeed psychological. I would only add that, as in the case of the Residency, we feel convinced that it is better to decide upon the change during a period of calm rather than to wait for another crisis and risk being forced into an undignified retreat. 11. Another, and most important, point is the common interest of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India both in Persia and the Persian Gulf. It is neither our wish nor our intention that the arrangements which we suggest should lead on the one hand to any diminution in the degree of control which His Majesty’s Government now exercise over the policy of the Residency, or on the other to any diminution either in the degree of care and attention which the interests of India at present receive from His Majesty’s Legation and Consulates, whether ’’Levant” or ’’India”, or in the extent to which the Government of India are consulted on all/13./ all important matters affecting Anglo-Persian relations. In order to emphasise this common interest we think it might he useful if the settlement eventually reached were to include a token payment of £10,000 a year hy His Majesty f s Government towards the expenses of the establishments in the Persian Gulf, and a token payment of £10,000 a year by the Government of India towards the cost of the establishments in Persia. The appearance of these sums in an inter-Governmental balance sheet would in normal circumstances have no more than a symbolical value, since they would cancel each other out, but symbols have their uses and it is possible to conceive of circumstances, e.g. a rupture of diplomatic relations with Persia, in which they might have a practical interest for both sides. 12. As regards capital expenditure, which for many years has been borne by each government separately, we have no doubt that we could come to some arrangement about our respective titles to the ownership of any property which might be affected by our scheme.mu 13. Finally, and for your most confidential information, let me add that in our opinion there is great advantage in seeking a solution of these problems at a time when the influence of His Majesty f s Government with the administration of the Government of India is still strong, and that it would be a pity to wait until the problems forced themselves into notice, perhaps with unwelcome publicity, through the growing independence of the Indian administration. 14. The Treasury are aware of the terms of this letter and are willing to discuss it jointly with the India Office and the Foreign Office as soon as you have formed a provisional opinion upon our proposal. 15. I am sending a copy of this letter to Hale at -“i the Treasury. Yours very sincerely.Minute Paper. political Department. Mr. V/a n. The proposals in the Viceroy’s private letter of the 19th August indicate a considerable advance on the lines are put forward by the Government of India it would seem that the Secretary of State could conscientiously and hopefully support them. The Viceroy in his letter of the 22nd April seemed to indicate that the Government of India were intending to put up formal proposals to the Secretary of State on the question, and it is perhaps desirable to have these before any approach is made to the Foreign Office. If you agree, it might be suggested that a private telegram should be sent to the Viceroy on the lines of the attached draft. proposed at B in the letter, for the reasonr stated in the It will of coarse be desirable to have an official letter before we approach the other Depts.

I have now been into it with them in some detail and I have given the fullest weight to the considerations adduced by you. In the outcome, our conclusions are, broadly speaking, as follows (a) I am definitely of opinion that we ought not to relinquish our present degree of control of the Eastern Consulates, or our present interest in them. My Finance Department suggested that it might indeed be better that we should take them over wholly and exclude them from the contract scheme, on the ground that H.M. G. might, if we ? continued to share the expenditure, insist on our making ex f ,ra appointments for reasons which did not concern us. I do not myself think that there is the least risk of this, and in any event we should have every opportunity of fightinggg^ppPPI ISs''. 2 . 0. V (*) any such proposal. As regards Bahrein, my Finance Department, if H. M. G. agree to our main scheme of a financial settlement of Persian charges on a lump sum basis, would agree to contribute 6 lakhs to the cost of the Bahrein move. They urge most strongly on me V that the existing 18 lakhs scheme is financially unjustifiable, and should on its merits be negatived on the ground of cost. But they equally strongly urge that if H.M.G. regard the project as of such importance as to be worth carrying through at a higher figure, our contribution should be limited to the 6 lakhs which we originally agreed to contribute and beyond which they never contemplated going; and they are emphatic that any contribution to the transfer should be conditional on acceptance by H.M.G. of our contract settlement for Persian expenditure. With that, I entirely agree. I think that this is a reasonable proposition, and I think that you will share my view too that in thecircumstances which have 'been under discussion between us, this reversion to the original offer of a contribution not exceeding 6 lakhs to the cost of the transfer, etc., of the Residency represents a substantial advance. I hope that this will strengthen your hands in discussions with other departments and make it possible to bring about the desired solution of the financial issue on the contract basis which I have already suggested.* ^ ' Minute Paper. 4 Q56- 'OS^S. Department. \ :U)00 10/31 Sir F« Stev/art , It was agreed in principle in May 1936 that the early transfer of the Residency to Bahrein was desirable for political reasons, and subject to examination of the financial implications. After this, discussion proceeded on the basis that the G. of I- and H.M.G. would share the cost on the condition, laid down by the G. of I., that their share did not come to more than Rs .6 lakhs. The G. of I. sent an officer of the P.W.D., Mr. Croad, to Bushire to discuss the matter with the Resident. Mr. Croad and Col. Fowle agreed that the Residency could be built for 12 lakhs (Bushire telegram of 24th October, 1936), and Mr. Croad submitted tee estimate to the G. of I. Since then the matter has been held up by two obstacles, and I think that the F.O. are only aware of the existence of the first and less important of them. (ijThe scheme submitted did not include accommodation for clericals and menials. Col. Fowle had anticipated that this would be built by local landowners, and that Govt, would only have to pay the rent allowances which they already pay at Bushire; the local landowners, however, were unwilling to take the risk of building unless Govt, gave a guarantee, which the G. of I. are unwilling to give, in respect of rent, and the only other alternative is for the^tt. of I. to put up these buildings themselves, which might cost another 3 lakhs. (tlJ The second and more serious obstacle is that the G. of I.’s ^inance Dept, have now gone back on the view that even as much as 6 lakhs should be paid towards the cost of the Residency, Sir J. Gngg wishing to reduce/tt- r^S reduce the amount to 2 lakhs (Mr. Laithwaite's letter of 16th April - 'flag X). Our views on the question of transferrin^ the Residency and the incidence of the cost are contained in the S. of S.'s letter of 28th June (flag Y). An important point is that if we go back on the understanding that India would pay half (up to 6 lakhs’), this will come as such a disappointment to the F.O. and Treasury after all that has happened^that it is likely to create a bad atmosphere for the reception of the major proposals which we are expecting from India for a new basis of allocation of expenditure m Persia and the Persian Gulfgenerally.FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. 26th July 1937. ^ My dear Stewart, I am not sure whether you know what a keen personal interest both my Secretary of State and I take in the question of the removal of the Residency in the Persian Gulf from Bushire to Bahrein, the general principle of which has already been accepted. I quite understand that owing to unexpected expense on the North West Frontier, the Budget of the Government of India has recently been unduly taxed. But this does not in any way diminish the importance on political grounds of securing the transfer at the earliest possible moment. If, then, a suitable opportunity occurs, I would be grateful if you could find it possible to have a word with Grigg before he returns to India, to enlist his personal support in spite of the difficulties with which he has recently been faced./ ) UU^ U- ^ ^ pAx-' 2^0 c.

I will go into it again with the Foreign Department and my Finance Department, and will let you know. I am very glad that you welcome the general proposition, for I am sure that it is a sound one, though I foresee a good deal of difficulty here over the matter of the Residency, ^s a preliminary view, let me sqy that I feel a good deal of doubt about the desirabilit^ of transferring the Eastern Consulates to the Foreign Office. They are of much less importance than they were, but I am still myself disposed to see advantage in having an Indian 'element on the Persian side of the border so long as there 1 i—■—■— &lt; is this tendency for incidents, at infrequent intervals I * agree, to occur on the Persia-Baluchi frontier. I have no doubt whatever that it is of assistance that our representative on the Persian side should be able to work in closely with people of his own service and his own Depart ment in the Government of India; and my first reaction therefore is rather definitely in favour of keeping Meshed and Deistan. I think I am right,too, in saying that there are not an inconsiderable number of Indian nationals in the area covered by those Consulates, and that if and when there comes a change of the present regime in Persia and2 &amp; frontier and customs restrictions are modified, their number may be materially increased.

You estimate the total at 10 lakhs. (Incidentally, iCii' my advisers are not sure.this is not A- an overestimate).

There are two points, however, which I must make. First, it is possible that if His Majesty’s Governme look favourably on your scheme, they might seek to make the transfer to the Porgpgn Office of the Eastern Consulates in Persia a condition of acceptance. What are the Government of India’s present views on this point? Secondly, I should hardly feel much confidence of success in putting the proposals to the Foreign Office unless I can be assured that the Government of India will not go back on their acceptance (at any rate implicit) of the principle that the Residency should be moved from Bushire to Bahrein and that the cost of the move should be shared. We are already morally committed up to the hilt on this question, and in any case it ts exceedingly difficult to argue that the main reasons for transfer Impr-rial rather( the prestige of the Resident and the efficiency of administration).

For intricate reasons not worth entering into now, India actually pays about £53,000 and H.I'.G. about £52,000 (1934-5 figures). In 1922 to 1926 the question of readjusting the incidence was x under discussion, but after a final unsuccessful attempt by Lord Birkenhead to reach a compromise with Sir Austen Chamberlain, the matter was dropped. At that time the F. O. proposal was that H.M.G. should ultimately bear all the cost (and man all the posts except Bushire) with an annual contribution of £50,000 from India, and that during an interim period H.IP.G.’s share should continue at £66,000 (estimated for 1923-4). (b) Persian Gulf / expenditure is at present met as follows. Koweit expenditure is shared (the total is about £7,800). Bahrein (total about £7,500) and Muscat (total about £11,500) are paid for from Indian revenues. But the G. of I. have already proposed, and we have already put the proposal to the F.O., that in present circumstances Bahrein and Muscat expenditure should, like Koweit expenditure, be shared equally between Imperial and Indian revenues. If this proposal were to be approved, the Gulf would cost H.M.G. and India about £13,500 each ‘(apart from capital expenditure, such as the building of a new Residency at Bahrein). It is understood, however, that the proposal, which is still under consideration by the 47K5 5000 5.86 • C. an 1 .reasury, has caused them to look again into tne whole/whole quest ion of Persian as well as Gulf expenditure, and it is possible, therefore, that the Treasury may propose a revision of Persian expenditure more favourable to themselves,and that we shall in any case have to deal with (a) and (b) together. The Viceroy seems to suggest (page 3 of the extract) that H.M.G. should in future take over full financial liability for Persia and the Gulf, India paying a lump sum (to be revised after five years) of ^75,000 per annum. This would mean that India would pay say &lt;115,000 in respect of Gulf expenditure and £60,000 for Persia - very roughly speaking, i.e., taking Persia and the Gulf together, she would pay nearly as much as she does at oresent, but would have no liability for any increased exoendit are. If this is the correct understanding of the Viceroy's proposal it would certainly seem worth while putting it to H.f.G. when it takes shape. As regards the staffing and control aspect, the Viceroy is anxious to keep the figure up to a point at which it is impossible for the 7.0. to claim uo take ever the Gulf. As regards staffing, we could m any case defend the present arrangements for manning the Gull posts ^rom Inuia on grounds of convenience and experience, iind so long as they continue the 1 . 0 . is the natural channel Ox correspondence with the Gulf, and as such should be aole ^o retain a full share of control and influence in the framing of policy, even though the sharing of financial responsibility might tend to increase the '. 0 . influence ^o some extent.

The G. of I., however, may wish to retain the Eastern Consulates, viz . . Seistan (including Leshed) and Duzdap (Zabul), and there may be difficulty over this. The point was in fact raised by h.li. Minister at Tehran daring the visit of the Persian Foreign Minister to Delhi in 1935 (see papers at flags A); and the '.0. may be expected to press it, if h.M.G. are asked to take over the primary financial responsibility. There remains the question of the capital expenditure on the projected new Residency at Bahrein. This has been under discussion for a long time past, and plans are already far advanced for starting to carry out. Though expenditure at Bahrein is borne by the G. of I., the Treasury (who bear half the cost of expenditure at Bushire, where the Residency now is) have indicated willingness to bear half the cost of a new Residency at Bahrein, on the assumption, of course, to which the G. of I. have not hitherto demurred, that the G. of I. bear the other half. It is very late in the day for the G. of I. to demur to this assumption, which they have hitherto accepted without question. As regards the policy of the transfer of the Residency, it has already been agreed on all hands (the G. of I. included) that it is desirable on political grounds for the Residency to be moved to Bahrein. The F.O. are strongly of opinion that it should be moved without delay (their arguments areconveniently ^awmarised in the riddle East Committee Minutes for May 5th, 1936 (flag B). The G. of I. are apparently not convinced (nor is this Dept, entirely convinced) that the matter is of such immediate urgency as the F.O. think. But there can be no doubt that sooner or later the Residency will have to be moved to Bahrein, and it really seems out of the question for the G. of I., who have (as the Viceroy admits)calready committed themselves very deeply, to withdraw from any financial liability (or confine themselves to meeting a small fraction of the cost). Even if it were decent for them to do so in any case, it seems the worst possible tactics to do so when they are asking for a revision of recurrent expenditure as a ^hole in their favour. Perhaps the S. of 3. might reply to the viceroy that his general idea for a revision of Persian and Persian; Gulf expenditure is one which seems well worth putting to H.i .G., and that the S. of S. will do so if the G. of I. put up a detailed scheme. The Treasury, however, think that the present system is unfavourable to them, and there is always a possibility that they may themselves propose a revision m their own favour; it would no doubt be .as well for the G. of I. to get their proposals in first. While it is impossible to foresee whether H.M.G. would accept the G. of 1.’s proposals, it is possible that if they did so, they might seek to make the transfer to the ?.0. of the Eastern Consulates in Persia a condition of doing so. What are the G. of I.’s views on this point? /* s w *■ P.Z.3275/36.

Minute Paper. Department to do this might well destroy any chance of the general proposals being accepted by H.M.G. Moreover, it is hardly right to suggest that the move is required on Imperial grounds merely, as the main reasons for the removal are (a) prestige - the Resident is in an exceedingly undignified position at Bushire, masquerading as a Consul- General, and the Persians may make his position untenable at any time; (b) convenience and efficiency of administration - he is badly out of touch at Bushire. Both these reasons are as valid from the G. of I.’s as from H.M.G.'s point of view. A draft paragraph will be prepared on these lines if approved.EXTRACT from private letter from Lord Linlithgow to Lord Zetland, dated 22nd April 1937. 4. The question of the incidence of expenditure in the Persian Gulf and the contribution made to that expenditure by India has recently been under consideration here, and I have discussed it with the financial authorities as well as with the Foreign Secretary, as you know, it is a subject which has been the bone of contention for many years, and our latest official proposals are contained in | a Despatch dated so far back as 1925 to which a final /V' reply is still awaited. Matters no doubt might have remained as they were for a little longer had it not been for the proposal to remove the headquarters of the Political .-resident from Bushire to Bahrein at a cost amounting to as much as res.18 lakhs, which has revived, in an acute form, the question of the propriety of a continued contribution by India on the present scale. It has been put to me somewhat forcibly that Indian, interests in the Gulf are no longer quite as they were, and that whatever their present importance, it is more than overshadowed by Imperial interests such as Oil, the Laval and Air Bases, and Arabian politics generally; and that the old arrangement whereby India pays very roughly one half of the divisible expenditure in Persia and the bulk of the expenditure on VI * - 2 - the Arabian shore is no longer fair to her. I an not prepared to go so far as the suggestion which is most strongly urged by the Finance Department that so far as India is concerned there is no reason why H.M.G. should not take over liability for the Gulf (and the Persian Agencies except Seistan and Duzdap). But I do most strongly feel that there is a definite case for an increase in the amount of the Imperial contribution and for safe guarding the financial position so far as India is concerned I am well aware of the course of the discussions which have taken place in the last few years at home in regard to political control in the Persian Gulf, and I know the importance which is attached to the framing of policy in that area by the Secretary of State for India as senior partner and the reasons which led to the decision that he rather than the Foreign office should exercise that responsibility. I recognise equally that in those circumstances there is no point in putting forv/ard proposals which might be regarded as excessive or as unduly controversial, and that we should be unlikely to get a tavourable reply to proposals of such a character in any reasonable time. But I wholly agree with my advisers here that the present position, in which we are exposed to the risk of an unlimited increase in our financial commitments3 4 in the Gulf is unsatisfactory, and in the light of the '^liscussions I have had, 1 am myself strongly in favour of the proposals which we now contemplate advancing officially that pending a suitable opportunity for raising the major question of the controversy of control and ^ financial liability with H.M.G. (a) H.M.G. should accept liability for half of the expenditure on the Arabian side; (b) our commitments in the Gulf shall be limited in future to their present figure as modified by the acceptance by H.M.G. of this increased liability in respect of the Arabian shore (We put forward official proposals to this effect some i „ time ago). The total figure, so far as we can estimate it, &gt; would on this basis be about rts .10 lakhs, and the supple mentary proposal I am anxious to put forward would be that our liability should be stabilized at this figure for an intial period of say 5 years, after which it would be revised, possibly downwards. Expenditure over and above the agreed figure would fall on H.M.G. I would be most grateful if you would let me know what your attitude would be towards proposals of this nature, and your estimate of the probability of their being approved. 1 do attach definite importance to securing their acceptance for 1 do not feel (and I think you will probably agree with- 4 - me) that the present situation is equitable, and I am quite sure that it is only on the basis of a rearrangement such as I suggest that we can avoid serious trouble at this end over expenditure in this area, realising as I do the importance of keeping the Secretary of State for India as the controlling authority in the matter of policy, I am most anxious to avoid the substitution of the F.O. But under the arrangement now suggested, the contribution made by India] revenues would still be of such an order as to make it impossible to challenge the retention of political control by the Secretary of State merely on the ground that India's contribution was infinitesimal in character. Let me go on to say a word about what is perhaps an equally controversial question, and that is the proposal to transfer the Bushire Residency to Bahrein. I have been into this with Grigg, who takes the strongest objection to any contribution such as would be involved in our bearing a 50:50 charge; and who while recognizing that we have gone a long way towards accepting a contingent liability, feels bound to reopen the whole question now that he sees what the figures are likely to be. I will not go into too much detail on this well worn topic. But quite frankly I do notthink that it makes any difference to us here whether the Resident lives in Bushire or not. I have never been in any way convinced by the arguments advanced by the foreign Office in favour of the transfer, and while I recognize after discussion with ^etcalfe that there are strong arguments of convenience forlocating the resident at Bahrein, I cannot I confess regard those arguments as of so substantial a character as to justify expenditure of the order involved. Nor am I or are my Foreign Department convinced by the F.O. arguments based on Persian Policy, though the Minister’s anxiety to be relieved of the presence of the Resident is understandable. I would not myself feel justified in opposing the view taken by the Finance Department here and of my Foreign Department (who, while accepting the argument of convenience as in favour of transfer, do not go beyond that); and on that assumption there is i fear nothing for it but that H.M.G. should bear the cost if they regard it as essential that the resident should be moved. In effect this means that we go back on our previous acceptance of the view that on political grounds he should be moved. If H.M.G. should decide that the move is imperative on Imperial grounds, 1 do not say that we should not be prepared to make some small contribution, perhaps even as much as a couple of lakhs.- 6 - But that is as far as we could go in this particular case, nd that only because 1 recognize that we have after all a certain liability in the light of past correspondence.p * &amp; * ■* Extract from Mr. Laithwaite f s private letter to Sir P. Stewart dated 16th April, 1937. 6. A mighty battle has been raging here about expenditure in the Persian Gulf. It was started by the Finance Department, who on a careful a priori examination of the case reached the conclusion that as India had no interest of any sort in Persia or in the Persian Gulf it was unreasonable that she should pay one penny of its expenditure there’. Aubrey Metcalfe, somewhat stunned by the violence of this attack, replied without much vigour that he found it difficult himself to see what justification there was for any such expenditure, or for the retention of any of our people in these areas. This of course represented a complete volte face from the attitude of the Government of India as submitted to the C.I.D. seven or eight years ago, which is all on record, and gave less than adequate recognition to the strategic and political interests of India in the Persian Gulf area, and Powle endeavoured, though without too much success at that stage, to redress the balance during his recent visit here. There has since been considerable informal discussion with Nixon, Coates, and Grigg himself, and the Viceroy has taken a very close personal interest in/2 2 Og) in the handling of the case and has gone through the 1928 discussions in the Persian Gulf Committee* He has also talked over the strategic aspect with Bartholomew, who was o^ course very strong indeed on the point. As a result I am glad to say that the Finance Department have somewhat modified their attitude, and the Viceroy will prohahly he sounding the Secretary of State in the very near future as to something in the nature of a contract budget based on H.M.G. bearing half the share of the Arabian expenditure; on a fixed budget of (I think) about 10 lakhs, being more or less our present Gulf expenditure, as modified by the acceptance by H*M.G• of a 50 per cent, share of the Arabian expenditure, for a period of 5 years, subject to revision thereafter. This in itself seems to me to be not unreasonable. I think the Office always felt that India was carrying more than she ought to on the Arabian side. But a 50 : 50 arrangement will at once be fairer to her without making it easier for the Foreign Office to challenge the exercise of a predominant political control by the Secretary of State on the ground that his financial contribution is so small, 7. Grigg, however, is most emphatic in his opposition to the removal of the Residency from Bushire, at/3. at any rate at the cost of India, and it was only with the greatest difficulty that he has 'been persuaded to volunteer to pay say two lakhs to the total cost of such removal should H.M.G. decide that on Imperial grounds removal is essential. The Foreign Department equally feel that the arguments for removal are inconclusive, and the Viceroy accepts their view. But here for once one cannot help feeling some little sympathy for the critics.L’r. Wa^fc'on ^ 'A ' ' yf” / Fote on the Incidence of diplomatic ~~ i- * and Consu lar expenditare in Persia . ^ 7 ^ u*vH £ 7t&gt; The position in regard to the incidence of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia seems to be rather worse than might appear from paragraph 2 of your note, and perhaps it is worth while to put the facts again on record. The Y/elby Commission recommended that diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia should be equally divided between H.M.Gr. and the 'lovernment of India and, in carrying out the Commission^ recommendation, it was supposed that on the basis of expenditure in 1900 this result would be approximately reached if India continued to make an annual payment to H:M:Gr. of £2,400 (remnant of general contribution £2,000 plus contribution for Kerman £400). Thereafter all increases or decreases of expenditure were to be shared between the two G-overnments. The Covernment of India f s annual payment was reduced by £1912.10.0., on the transfer of Kerman from the foreign Office to the (Governmentyd of India so that it now stands at £487.10.0. Owing to miscalculations made at the time ana to the figures on which the settlement was based, this arrangement has worked out very unfairly for India and the position is that India, instead of receiving from the Foreign Office an annual payment of about £1000 towards the equalisation of the 1900 expenditure which she would receive if the Welby Commission’s recommendation (i.e. equal division of expenditure) were being carried out, actually continues herself to make an annual contribution to the Foreign Office of about £500. The resulting overpayment^ made by India amounts to £3,087.15.10. per annum, which is arrived at as follows Indian expenditure £23,894.11.9.

The question of a revision of the incidence of expenditure was much discussed in 1922 and succeeding years. The G. of I. in a despatch dated 13th July, 1922, proposed that India should bear all ordinary expenditure at the eastern Consulates (Meshed. Sistan etc., Kerman and Bunder Abbas), one-third of that at Bushire and one-third of that at Teheran, asdr that Imperial Revenues should bear the remainder ; end that India should man the eastern Consulates and also Bushire. The Foreign Office in a letter of 14th July, 1924, proposed that H.M.G. should ultimately man all posts except Bushire and bear the cost with a con- tribution of £50,000 a year from India, subject to H review after five years, and that v/hile this ultimate solution was being worked up to 7 the share of expenditure falling on H.M.G. should continue at £ 66,000 (estimated for 1923-4). The G. of I. and the India Office (letter to F.O. of 22nd November, 1926) adhered to their original proposal and the question lapsed for the time being. From the Indian point of view it was cionsidered to be of considerable political importance that the eastern Consulates and Bushire should continue to be manned by the Indian service and remain under the administrative control of the G. of I. A small change in regard to the question of incidence has been made provisionally as a result of the discussion of the main question; new capital expenditure at the eastern Consulates and Bushire is provisionally charged to the G.. of I. while similar expenditure at Tehran and the other 415b 3000 10/31 posts/Minute Paper.

The climax was reached, from the Government of India’s point of vier, when the Secretary of State in Council'committed them against their will to contribute a 'ioiet Tr o^ the loan of ££,0G0,0C0 promised under the abortive M Curzon Agreement M of 1919. As a result, Council nassed a. Resolution 'that the whole question of the incidence of expenditure in Persia,, as between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers, should be further investigated; and they recommended that, as a preliminary, the matter should be examined by the India Office in' consultation with the Government of India.,.'’ The Government oi India were invited in August 1919 to submit their views in the first place, and did so in a despatch dated 13th July 1922. Put briefly, the view expressed was that though the original Imperial and Indian interests in Persia which the V/elby Commission in 1900 had icunc. to be of equal relative importance, justifying an equal division of expenditure, remain unchanged, new Imperial interests, in which India has no share,- nave h rown u ? in the past twenty years to an extent wnicn upsets tne original balance between these interests and Indian interests: the principal examples citec. were the Imperial Bank of Persia the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and the emergence of Iraq as a State under British mandate. The Government of India were ledto the opinion that the present ratio between Imperial and Indian interests inP.180/23 in Persia was such as to justify a division of expenditure in future in the proportions 2 Inperial, 1. Indian. Puj simply to divide the combined o uOuals ox British and Indian expenditure on a new oasis would perpetuate the administrative disadvantages inherent in any system of divided control: they therefore recommended that for the future the Consulates in Southern and Eastern Persia which lie in a preponderatinyly Indian sphere of interest, and axe staffed by India, should be maintained wholly at India f s cost; the remainder should oe stafied and maintained by the Foreign Oifice at its sole cost; and the cost of the Legation and the Consulate-General at Bushire, both Ox which serve Imperial and Indian interests jointly, should be divided in the proportion 2 Imperial: 1 Inrian. Tne Indiana posts being more expensively i^intainea tlian the British, this proposal was more favourable to the Imperial exchequer than a simple redistribution of cost on the new basis would have been. These views were put to the Foreign Office, in a letter dated 7th March 1923. At c-bout tne sa.te time the Minister in Teheran suggested that it would make the Persian Branch of the Levant Consular service more attractive, and therefore more efficient, if the number of superior posts open to its members were increased hythe transfer to the Levant Service of certain of those staffed by the Indian Political Department; end pointed out that such transfers would lead to economy of public funds, since the Consular Services standard of establishment is less expensive than the Indian. The Minister suggested also consideration of the question of the ultimate unification of the Persian Consular Service, i.e. the transfer of an. posts in Persia to the Levant Service, though he freely admitted that there were • some places, especially those in which there is a large Indian community, where an Indian trained officer could hardly be dispensed with, and also that the existing system of a Consular body derived irom two separate services, though an anomaly in theory, works quite well in practice. On the 15th January 1924 the Foreign Office replied to the India Office letter of 7th March 1923 soaring that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs could not accept the principle underlying the proposal that expenditure should be divided nenceforth on a 2:1 basis, and seeking to show that India is still interested in Persia. At the same time the Foreign Office urged the need for reducing the expenditure borne by Imperial Funds. To this the India Office responded on 10th March 1924 by a brief recapitulation of the ar-usients previously advanced, and a request for the reasons rhy they, and India's desire for a more equitable divisionP.2959/24 xStatements actual exper in 1923-24 1 since been r and the tabi; stataments £ are based or instead of t estimates or the Foreign based their calculations jzfihese figur more correct 171,000 and respectively.

The India Office expressed willinaness to enter into oral discussion, ’out asked as a preliminary for some staterr.entof the Foreign Office's position. This request the Foreign Office again evaded in their letter of 14th March 1924, and proceeded to call an interdepartmental conference which duly met on the Tth ’iay 1924. At this meeting the Foreign Office (and Treasury) made no effort to dispose of the considerations previously adduced in correspondence by the Government of India and India Office; but, instead, sprang on the meeting an entirely new proposal, which was later set forth in an official letter dated 14th July 1924. The India Office representatives at the meeting contented their opinion on the new scheme. This scheme may be summarised as follows:- xStatements of the actual expenditure in 1923-24 have since been received and the tabular statements appended are based on'these, instead of the estimates on which the Foreign Office based their calculations. jzfthese figures should more correctly be 171,000 and £§7,000 respectively. x Tu assumes that the total expenditure on Diplomatic ana Consular representation in a normal on uhe present system, (1523-24 estimates being taken for the purpose) would be £138,000, and that unuer tne present so-caliec. 'half and half” system 0 ., c.ivision India would contribute, on adjustment b $ * £72,000 and the Foreign Office ,266,000. The proposal is that arrangements should■■ aexceT)t a-oparenuly Bushire, Tout this is not cloar. x see comment above as to the inaccuracy of this finure. H be made gradually to replace all officers of the Indian service at Consular posts in Persia by officers of the Levant service: that the entire responsibility for the maintenance of the posts should be assumed by the Foreign Office as each is transferred to the Levant Consular service, and that the Government of India should pay, in full discharge of their liability, a yearly contribution. The Foreign Office T s present contribution x is assumed to be £15,000 per annum. They are not (or were not in 1924) prepared to pay more than that. But they are prepared to continue to pay that, end they calculate that when all the posts are staffed by one Levant service the total annual cost will be reduced to £115,000. Thus when the transfer is complete, India’s contribution would be reduced , oy progressive economies as more and more posts are transferred, to £50,000. (If Bushire also were to •;6 oransferrea, the Foreign Office estimate that the total annual cost might be reduced to £ 97 , 000 : in that event India’s contribution would presumably be scaled down lower still.) This scheme the Foreign Office believe to be the only way'to effect a substantial reduction of e:,peiidi uure from Indian Bevenues without a correspondingly substantial increase of expenditure ' ron Imperial Funds, a contingency which the then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, at any rate, stated that he was not prepared*to contemplate.7 P. 3660/25* There are obviously several respects in which this scheme may be subjected to criticism; but as a first step the Secretary of State without offering any observations himself, asked the Government of India for their comments, on 25th August 1924. The Government of India replied fourteen months later in a despatch dated 8 th October 1925, after consulting officers serving in South and East Persia, - a process which no doubt took some time. Briefly, they rejected the scheme. Their rea.sons for doing so were (O The point at which India's contribution woula be reduced to £50,0C0 will not be reached for aany_years, and the relief that India will receive in the meantime will not be great. ui) Even when that point is reached India will oe paying nearly half the total, which is a share greater than the Government of India consider equitable, for reasons already stated.

This would give either party free scope for and some incentive for economy in its sphere. At this stage an impasse seemed to have been reached. The Government of India r s views, as stated in October 1925^ have now been communicated to the Foreign Office, with a letter (dated 22nd November 1926) pressing for reconsideration of the proposals previously put forward by this Office, and it is just oossible perhaps tha,t the im^a.sse may be solved by the acceptance of the proposals by the Foreign Office. But there is, it is feared, little chance of this; and the Government of India have informed the Secretary of State that, if the Foreign Office cmnno c os pei suaceci uo accept their proposal as it stands, they would be prepared, in order to :ecure a settlement, ,( a ) 'k° a Sf e f&gt; reluctantly, to continue to oear one-naif, instead of one-third; of the cost o.: ^ uhe Residency and Consulate-General at Bu shire.

Actual expenditure in 1923-24, the year on the estimated expenditure for which the Foreign Office have based their calculations, amounted to £132,222 . If LIo hammer ah had been staffed, as the Government of India agree it should be in future, by the Levant service, this total would, it is estimated, have been reduced to £131,234, this sum hasbeen increased by (a) £1200 in respect oi one auditional cost oi the f, Lee Concessions M to against aonorma.! credits appearing in the account for 1925-24.

On this basis India would continue to pay very nearly one half of the total, very mch more than the third share which, it is argued, represents her logical contribution. (4) IT, in order to secure acceptance by the Foreign Office of the Government of India's proposals, it should prove necessary to offer to coiiuribute uo the Foreign Office for 3 years a fixed annual sum representing the difference between what India pays now and what she would have to pay underthose proposals, the annual sum required under scheme (2) would be £7,721 which might be rounded off to £7,500 or even £7000 since the Foreign Office have assumed their present expenditure to be £ 66,000 instead of £65,656 - actual expenditure in 1923-24; and under scheme (3) £2,732 which might similarly be rounded off to £2500 or £2000. A detailed statement 'A” is attached showing how the expenditure actually incurred in 1923-24 (modified by transferring Mohamnerah to the Levant Service) would be divided under the Government of India’s original proposals, i.e. scheme (2). A similar statement 'B' showing the modification caused by the division of expenditure in connection with Bushire in moieties (i.e. scheme 3) is also attached. In neither case do the figures include * the sum of £3500 per annum which, as explained above, has been added for the purpose^ of calculating the sum to be divided in future. It is suggested that in discussion with the Foreign Office ( 1 ) the arguments for the Government of India’s proposals, which the Foreign Office have never attempted to controvert on their merits, might again be pointed out, on the chance (very remote, it is feared) that the Foreign Office and Treasury my, on reconsideration, agree to accept the Government of India’s proposals as they stand; ( 2 ) assuming that this fails, the offer mightbe made,if India’s proposals are accepted otherwise, to pay for three years a fixed annual contribution in aid of Foreign Office expenditure of an amount approximately equal to the difference between what India pays under the existing system of division and what she will pay under the new system - say, (taking the 1923-24 figures used in this note) £7000 or £7500 a year; (3) as a last resort the offer might be made to bear one-half instead of one-third of the cost of Bushire. (2) , which the Government of India in their telegram of the 25th June 1926. expressed their willingness to agree to only in the last resat , is here put before (3), because it is felt that (3) alone would probably not secure an agreement witn the Foreign Office, whiek (2) alone conceivably might. Also.(3) is really the larger concession of the two, and it is undesirable to make it if it can be avoided. The cost of (2) alone is roughly £22,000, spread over three years. The cost of (3) alone would be, on present figures, roughly £5,000 a year, continuing indeiinitely. The cost of making both concessions would be £7,000 or £7,500 a year for three years, plus £5000 a year thereafter. /:Statement showing portion of expenditure for 1923-24 which will fall on India if the Government of India’s proposals for the division of Persian Expenditure are accepted, with the r j-lficaticn that India hears one-half instead of one-third of the cost of Bushire.Statement showing portion of expenditure for 1923-24 which will fall on India if the Government of India’s proposals for the division of Persian Expenditure are accepted, with the r tdficaticn that India hears one-half instead of one-third of the cost of Bushire. 7 (2^h- &amp; .719 i ]p39 I rieno . &amp;5C1 I &lt;s MEMORANDUM ON THE CONTRIBUTIONS MADE FROM INDIAN AND BURMA REVENUES TOWARDS THE DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR EXPENDITURE OF HIS MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT BURMA OFFICE 1938(mJ) 'jay MEMORANDUM.

In a letter to the Government of India, dated 31st No. 339/B/36 March, 1937, the Government of Burma agreed to accept, with (915) effect from 1st April, 1937, the future liability for the annual contribution of approximately £2,488, formerly made P.Z.3233/37. from Indian to Imperial Revenues in respect of the consular expenditure of His Majesty’s Government in the Chinese province of Yunnan and in Siam, This contribution is composed as follows* ~ £ Fixed annual contribution in respect of Tengyueh (Homein) (Yunnan) 410. -. -. Fixed annual contribution in respect of Chiengmai (Siam) ..... 1000. -. -. Moiety of expenses at Lakhon (Nakawn Lampang) (Siam) and of additional expenses at Chiengmai - average over 4 years 1931-32 to 1934-35 - ••&lt;&gt;»«• 1077.19.11. £ 2487.19.11. 2. The above contributions, however, which are in respect of consular posts situated close to the China-Burma and Siam-Burma boundaries, form only one element among the contributions which have been made annually by the Government of India, since the early years of the 19th century, towards the Diplomatic and Consular Expenditure of His Majesty’s Government. These contributions, which have varied very considerably both in amount and composition from time to time and to which there is no parallel in the case of other parts of the British Empire, were investigated by the Royal Commission on the Administration of the Expenditure of India, presided over by Lord Welby, which presented its Final Report to Parliament in 1900, and the Report of this Commission, relevant extracts from which are reproduced in Appendix I to this Memorandum, provides perhaps the most convenient starting point for an examination of these contributions in general and in particular of the origin and raison d’etre of those particular payments for which the future 1 iability has been transferred from the Government of India to the Government of Burma.2 II. THE WELBY COMMISSION. h Appendix I 3. It will be observed from its Report that the Commission discovered in historical circumstances 5 connected inter alia with the East India Company's interest in oriental trade, the explanation for the imposition upon Indian revenues of contributions towards Diplomatic and Consular expenditure which had no parallel in the relations of His Majesty's Government with other parts of the British Empire, and that while they recognised the defensibility of the principle of apportionment, they considored that the rate of apportionment required constant revision. v 4. The two chief items of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure to which the Government of India contributed in the 19th century and to which the Welby Commission, therefore. Appendix I referred, were the Legation and Consulates in Persia and the China Consular Establishments. The history of the Government of India's expenditure on Diplomatic and Consular services in Persia, from the establishment of the Mission in 1810 until the Foreign Office Conference (1891) fixed the Government of India's contribution at £7*000, is summarised in paragraph 242 Appendix I of the Commission's Report. The Commission declared that in the case of this expenditure it was desirable to adopt a general principle of division which would put an end to endless disagreement and discussion, and they therefore suggested that as both countr'ies admittedly had a large interest in Persia, the charges of the Mission and Consulates should be evenly divided between them. Appendix I No.95 of 1889 No.312 [Financial] of 1888. 5. The history of the expenditure, first of the East India Company and later of the Government cf India, upon the China Consular Establishments, is summarised in paragraph 243 of the Commission's Report. In a despatch dated 26th March, 1889, the Government of India informed the Secretary of State, in response to a despatch asking for their views, of the amount they considered they might reasonably be required to contribute on account of the Consular Establishments in China, ’^e are unable to admit', they wrote 'as a matter of course, that any share of these charges should bo borne by India, and we believe that no share cf them is charged against other British Colonies whose interests are similarly protected. It will be admitted that England would be obliged 5 in her own interests, to keep up these Establishments, whether she held India or not. The number and cost of the Establishments are determined by the English Governmentj the members of the Establishments are appointed by the English Foreign Office; they take their orders direct from England; ani they are primarily occupied in protecting English interests, 6 . v In these circumstances wo consider that England should meet the whole cost of the Diplomatic and Consular staff, excepting only such additional expenditure as can clearly be shown to be due to the Establishments being required, to some extent, to look after Indian as well as English interests. This additional expenditure, if any, is Appendix I Appendix I x Marginal references to Appendices and Paragraphs are references to appendices and paragraphs of this Memorandum,believed to be small, but in view of the fact that India has hitherto paid a portion of the cost, we do not object to a yearly payment of £ 10 , 000 , though this sum is, we believe, much larger than would bo found to be due on a direct application of the principle we have just stated.' 7. In 1891, however, the Foreign Office Conference fixed the Government of India’s contribution under this head at £12,500, and the Welby Commission rocommended that this sum should be confirmed in view of the recognised interest of India in the China trade generally and the opium trade in particular. They further recommended that this sum should be reviewed after 5 or 6 years in the light of the conditions then existing. 8 . The Welby Commission also referred in paragraphs 248 and 249 of their Report to two further contributions made by the Government of India towards consular expenditure, namely, the contributions in respect of the Jeddah and Chiengmai Consulates, upon neither of which had the Government of India raised any question. They pointed out that while the former was made in consideration of the number of Indian pilgrims passing through Jeddah on their way to Mecca, the Chiengmai post had originally been established entirely at the Government of India’s expense for the protection of British Indians in Northern Siam. .9. The Report of the Welby Commission, however, was not unanimous and, among the many reservations made, some related to the question of the Government of India’s contributions to Diplomatic and Consular expenditure. ”lt is clear' wrote Mr. T.R, Buchanan, M.P., for instance, 'that India should be relieved of all charges for Missions and Consulates in Persia, China and other places. Elsewhere throughout the British Empire these duties are Imperial duties, and their expenses defrayed from Imperial funds. No valid reason can be adduced for placing an exceptional burden in this respect on India.' 10. Sir W. Wedderburn, Mr. W.S. Caine and Mr. D. Naoroji, on the other hand, who submitted a separate Report, agreed with the recommendations of their colleagues regarding the Government of India’s contributions to Diplomatic and Consular expenditure, but expressed the opinion that in all cases where British Colonies and Dependencies in Australia and the Far East were also interested, they should be required to pay their share.THE POST-WELBY SETTLEMENT. Appendix I 17th July 1900 Appendix II. 11. The Welby Commission recommended (vide paragraph 364 ^ of Final Report) that, by way of liberal treatment of India, the following grants should be made by the Imperial Government to the Government of India £ In aid of the charge for the India Office 50,000 Half the military charges for Aden Increased contribution to the charge of the Persian Mission Half the cost of the transport of troops to and from India 130,000 108,000 5,000 11th Septembe] 1900 Total £293,000 and the method whereby the Commission’s recommendations in this respect should be implemented, formed the subject of correspon dence between the India Office and the Treasury which is reproduced in Appendix II to this Memorandum. 11th August, 12. It will be observed that, after pointing out that the 1900 sum of £108,000 on account of half the military charges for Aden should have been stated as 10.8 lakhs of rupees or £72,000, the India Office suggested to the Treasury that the opportunity might be taken to put an end to certain minor payments made annually by the Government of India to Imperial revenues, and thereby to simplify the accounts between the two Governments. The payments referred to were as follows:- £ On account of Mission to Court of Persia 7,000 On account of HoM’s Consular Establishments in China 12,500 On account of Consulates at Jeddah, Homein (Tengyueh) and Basra 1,787 Subsidy to Eastern Telegraph Company on account of the Zanzibar - Mauritius Cable 10,000 Total £31,287 The India Office suggested tha+-. the recommendations of the Commission might be implemented by relieving Indian revenues as follows:-£ Political charges (including Telegraph Subsidy) Transport of troops Share of Aden expenses Total 31,287 130.000 100.000 £261,287 They added that Lord George Hamilton was 'prepared to accept that sum as satisfying the equitable claims of India under existing circumstances in respect of the subjects referred to the Royal Commission', 13. In their reply, the Treasury informed the India Office that the Secretary of State for War had agreed to contribute, as proposed by the India Office, £230,000 annually from Army Funds towards the cost of the transport of troops and towards the military charges for Aden. With regard to the payments which the India Office had suggested should be foregone by the Imperial Government, the Treasury agreed that the opportunity should be taken for putting an end to those payments so far as circumstances justified, and that for their part they were ready to give up the Indian contribution of £10,000 per annum towards the subsidy for the Zanzibar-Mauritius Cable. It was pointed out, however, that the other payments were appropriated in aid of the Diplomatic and Consular Vote, and that the Foreign Office had therefore had to be consulted with regard to the India Office proposals. 14. The Foreign Office, it appeared, had informed the Treasury that Lord Salisbury was prepared to agree that 'the contribution of £12,500 towards the establishments in China should no longer appear as an appropriation-in-aid of the Diplomatic and Consular Vote, and that the £7,000 now furnished by India towards Imperial expenditure in Persia should be reduced by £5,000’. 15. With regard to the contributions from Indian revenues towards the maintenance of various Consulates in Persia, China and Siam, the Foreign Office suggested that these small payments should be merged in one general contri bution 'which, however much reduced, might still be regarded as a share of the Imperial expenditure in China, Persia and Siam'. They accordingly suggested that the Government of India should in future contribute £6,000 per annum to the Diplomatic and Consular Vote, this sum being arrived approximately as follows:- £ Remnant of general contribution for Persia 2,000 Existing contribution for Kerman 400 u ii ii Jeddah 790 u n n Basra 1,400 u u it Chiengmai (Siam) 1,000 n it u Home in (Tengyueh) (Yunnan) 474 Total 6 , 0 6411th October, 1900 6 . 16. The India Office accepted the proposals, put forward by the Treasury and the Foreign Office regarding both the relief to be given to Indian revenues and the contribution to be made from Indian revenues in-future towards the Diplomatic and Consular expenditure of His Majesty T s Government, so that the relief to Indian revenues was finally fixed as follows:- Transport of troops 130,000 Aden 100,000 Zanzibar - Mauritius Cable 10,000 China Establishments 12,500 Persian Mission, etc. 5,000 Total £257,500 r Paragraph 4. 17. It had previously been agreed between the India Office and the Treasury, that any arrangements which might be made as a result of the consideration of the recommendations in the Report of the Royal Commission on Indian Expenditure, should come into force on 1st April 1901, up to ™hich date the payments by India would remain unaltered. 18. It will be observed that the contribution of £6,000 which it had been agreed should in future be made annually from Indian revenues towards the Diplomatic and Consular expenditure of His Majesty's Government., included two of the contributions, namely those for Momein (Tengyueh) and Chiengmai, for which the liability has now been transferred from the Government of India to the Government of Burma. Before investigating the origin and ra ^ S011 &lt; ^ &gt;e ^ re these particular contributions, however, it will fee convenient briefly to trace the subsequent history of the other items which composed the Government of India’s fixed contribution, namely the contributions in respect of the Persian Mission and Consulates (£2,000), Kerman (£400), Jeddah (£790) and Basra (£1,400).THE PERSIAN MISSION AID CONSULATES (INCLUDING KERMAN) AND THE PERSIAN GULF. 19. In accordance with the recommendations of the Welby Commission, the cost of the Diplomatic and Consular Services in Persia has in theory been shared equally, since 1900, between Imperial and Indian revenues. In practice, however, owing to certain miscalculations made at the time and to the figures on which the post-Welby settlement, in the case of Persia, was based, a slightly greater share of the expenditure has fallen upon Indian than upon Imperial revenues. 20. The fixed contribution of £2,400 in respect of the Persian Mission and Consulates (including Kerman), which after 1900 was included in the annual contribution of £ 6,000 made from Indian Revenues to the Diplomatic and Consular vote, was later reduced by £1,912. 10s. Od. on the transference of Kerman from the Foreign Office to the Government of India, so that it now stands at £487«10. Od. This sum, which continues to be included in the annual adjustment between the India Office and the Foreign Office, is still intended to equalise, as between His Majesty*s Government and the Government of India, the cost of the Diplomatic and Consular services in Persia as it stood in 1900. 21. This remnant of the Government of India’s fixed contribution, hov/ever, now forms but an insignificant part of the total annual expenditure of the Government of India upon Diplo matic and Consular Establishments in Persia and in the Persian Gulf. All new expenditure of this kind incurred since 1900, both in the interior of Persia and on the Persian side of the Gulf, has been shared in roughly equal proportions by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, while similar expenditure incurred on the Arab side of the Gulf (except at Koweit) has been borne entirely by Indian Revenues. The arrangement may be summarised as follows:- 22. The Legation at Teheran and the Consular posts in Northern and Western Persia are maintained and paid for in the first instance by the Foreign Office and staffed in the case of the Consulates, from the Levant Consular Service, while the Consular posts in Eastern and Southern Persia^, and also the Residency at Bushire, are maintained and paid for in the first instance by the Government of India and staffed by the Indian Political Service. The two annual bills are adjusted subsequently, so that, of their combined totals, one half (actually rather less) is paid by His Majesty’s Government and one half (actually rather more) by the Government of India. Using the figures for the financial year 1934-5 the arrangement works as follows :- £. s. d. £. s. d. Indian expenditure 3435 62,776. 12. 1 Indian expenditure at 30th September 1900 23,894. 11. 9 Consulates-General: Bushire, Meshed. Consulate: i\erman.

New works are generally paid for by the Government which mans the Consulate or Agency. P.Z.7846/37. 23. The Welby Commission recommended, in paragraph 356 of their Report, that the British Foreign Office should not create or add to the Establishments and Services under its control without the consent of the Government of India, and vice v ersa , that the Government of India should not add to the Establishments and Services under their control without the consent of the Foreign Office. A convenient working arrangement was eventually reached, however, under which reference was not made in practice to either Government when the sum involved was less than £100. It will be observed that the actual expenditure of the Government of India is considerably greater than that of the Foreign Office, the difference being due inter alia to the higher rates of pay etc., of the staffs provided by the Indian Political Service. 24. With regard to the posts on the .arabian side of the Persian Gulf, the cost of the Agencies at Bahrein and Muscat is borne entirely by the Government of India, expenditure at the Koweit Agency being shared equally with His Majesty’s Government and included in the annual adjustment in respect of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure. All the posts on the Arabian side of the Gulf are staffed by the Indian Political Service. 25. In the years following the Yfar, the Government of India tried to secure a general re-adjustment of the incidence of expenditure in Persia and the Persian Gulf as between Imperial and Indian Revenues on the ground that the ratio between Imperial and Indian interests in those regions had changed since the moietj principle was adopted on the recommendation of the Welby Commissic ’’The interests of Great Britain and of India in the country” wrote the India Office to the Foreign Office on the 7th March, 1923, 'had till then been common, and so for as apportionment is possible, equal, centering as they did, during the century preced ing the date of the Commission, firstly, in the maintenance of British influence in Persia as forming ultimately a means of defending Great Britain’s position in India against possible attack from or through Persia, and, secondly, in the protection and encouragement of Persia’s import and export trade with Great Britain and India”. 26. Yfhile it was admitted that the factors which might be assumed to have led the Welby Commission to recommend an equal division of expenditure in Persia had remained practically unchanged, it was pointed out that during the intervening yearsnew interests of great importance had grown up, connected inter alia with the development of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and other big concessionaire companies and with the emergence of Iraq as a state under British Mandate, which were almost exclusively Imperial as opposed to Indian in character, and which had, therefore, upset the ratio upon which the recommendations of the Welby Commission as to the incidence of expenditure in Persia had been based. 27. The Government of India's attempt to secure a settle ment of this question in their favour did not, however, meet with success and the question remained dormant until it was recently revived. The Government of India's latest proposals for a settlement, designed to ’’define, limit, and stabilise” India's financial liabilities in Persia and the Persian Gulf, were transmitted to the Foreign Office in a letter dated 16th Larch, 1938. ”ln the years that have passed since this subject was last under active consideration by His Majesty's Government”, wrote the India Office, ’’the growth of Imperial (as compared with Indian) interests has increased both in Persia and also, and more particularly, on the Arab coast of the Gulf. The reasons which moved the Government of India in 1922 to ask for a revision in their favour of the division of expenditure resulting from the recommendations of the Vfelby Commission, have become increasingly strong, and Lord Zetland agrees with the Government of India that the time has come to propose that the position should be re examined by His Majesty's Government”.10 • v - JEDDAH . 28.

In a letter to the Foreign Office, dated 11th January, 1923, the India Office pointed out that the standing Indian Page 7o contribution of £4,087*10.Od* (i*e. £6,000 less £1,912*10*0d* as a result of the transference of Kerman to the Government of India), which for many years had been made in adjusting diplo matic and consular expenditure, still included an item of £1,400 in respect of the Consulate at Basra and that presumably such expenditure had ceased with the declaration ox war against Turkey in 1914, or shortly afterwards* 'If this is so, n they wrote, ’’the Indian contribution towards the expenses of the Consulate should apparently have been discontinued from the date of cessation, and refunds are due to Indian funds on account of a part of the year 1914-15 and of the three subse quent years* For 1918-19 and the following years the contri bution of £4,087*10*0d., should apparently be reduced to £2,687*10.Od.” P.972/23* 30* In their reply, dated 14th March, the Foreign Office stated that the Treasury had agreed to the refund of £1,400 per annum for the three years ended 31st March, 1918, in respect of the contribution made by the Government of India towards the cost of the Consulate at Basra, and that the Government of India’s general contribution for subsequent years would be reduced to £2,687*10*0d*SIAM AND YUNNAN 31. The two remaining contributions included, in 1900, in the Government of India’s fixed annual contribution of £ 6,000 in respect of diplomatic and consular expenditure, were the contributions in respect of Chiengmai (£1,000) and i.Ioniein (Tengyueh) (£474), for which the liability has now been trans ferred to the Government of Burma, and the origin and raison d’etre of these contributions will now be examined.

Between 1871 and 1876 two proposals were under con sideration with the object of securing adequate protection for British subjects in the frontier provinces of Siam;- (1) The establishment of a 'native agent*’, subordinate to the authorities in British Burma, at Zimmay (Chiengmai). (2) The appointment of a British European officer as Assistant Political Agent there. In 1876 a dacoity near Chiengmai on a British subject, Moung Bike, brought matters to a head and in a letter dated 18th June, 1877, the Government of India expressed the conviction that the only effective means of securing prompt and proper disposal of suits in Chiengmai in which British subjects were plaintiffs, would be by the appointment of a resident British Vice-Consul under the orders of the Consul-General at Bangkok. They intimated their readiness to defray the entire cost of such an appointment from Indian Revenues, the Vice-Consul to have a salary of Rs.5,000 a year besides the necessary establish ment. This proposal was passed on to the Foreign Office, who agreed that the Government of India should nominate such an officer, if he were appointed, provided they undertook to select an Englishman for the post. 33. A final decision in the matter was deferred, however, pending the result of a mission by a Major Street to the Court of Siam with the object of enquiring into the state of affairs in Siam generally and in the frontier provinces in particular. The general results of this mission were communicated to the Secretary of State by the Government of India in a letter dated 28th January, 1880, and their recommendations regarding the appointment of an officer to reside at Chiengmai were set out in a second letter of the same date. They pointed out that for geographical reasons Chiengmai was in much closer inter course with British Burma than with Bangkok and that the appoint ment of such an officer, which had been repeatedly recommended on commercial and political grounds since 1860, was more necessary than ever in view of the increase in trade between Burma and Siam and the constant complaints of the want of proper protection of traders. 34. The protection of British traders was not, however, the only justification for the appointment of an officer at Chiengmai; it was also considered necessary as a means of con trolling the activities of British subjects in the province.13. 24th March 7th August For under the Imperial Treaty of 1855 with Siam and the Order in Council of 28th July, 1856, British subjects were exempted from the civil jurisdiction of the local Siamese Courts and, subject to certain restrictions and limitations, from their criminal jurisdiction also* This exemption had been largely confirmed by the Treaty of 1874 between India and Siam which applied to^ the three northern provinces of Chiengpiai, Lakon and Lampoonchi only, but it was later discovered that the provisions of the 1874 Treaty were in some respects inconsistent with those of the Treaty of 1855* The rights enjoyed by British subjects in Siam under these Treaties encouraged them, in practice, to put forward very high pretensions on the ground of cheir nationality* ’’The appointment of an English officer to reside permanently at Chiengpiai, n wrote the Government of India, however, ’’would effectually remove most of the existing grounds of complaint and we strongly recommend Your Lordship's sanction to such an arrangement*” 35* It was pointed out that one possible solution of the problem, favoured by Major Street himself and by the Chief Commissioner of British Burma, was to endow such an oixicer with definite judicial powers but that, as he would be concerned in his judicial capacity almost exclusively with British Burmese subjects who were amenable to the Acts and Orders oi the Government of India, this would make it almost essential for tho appointment to be made by the Government of India and the officer placed in subordination, in his judicial capacity, to the Chief Commissioner of British Burma* It was pointed out, moreover, that such a solution would not really be practicable unless the entire control of British diplomatic relations with Siam were transferred to the Government of India. 36* The alternative solution, favoured by the Government of India themselves, was that an officer without judicial functions should be established at Chiengmai as Vice-Consul under the authority of the Consul-General at Bangkok, with the right of intervening in any case in which British interests might be injuriously affected* The Government oi India pointed out that, in the light of Major Street's report, it appeared that 'the mere presence of a British officer would suffice to restrain the illegalities and irregularities of the Siamese officials in the disposal of suits in which British subjects are concerned, to check the extravagant claims oi our own subjects, and to facilitate and promote all trade operations'• 37* In forwarding a copy of the Government of India's 1880 despatch to the Foreign Office, the India Office drev/ their attention to the fact that some revision of the Imperial Treaty of 1855 and/or the Indo-Siamese Treaty of 1874 might be necessary before the judicial problem at Chiengmai could be entirely solved and they suggested that, pending the completion of this lengthy process, a British officer should be deputed to Chiengmai as Vice-Consul without judicial functions. It was added that the Secretary of State for India was not disposed to support the suggestion that the entire management of diplomatic relations with Siam should be transferred to the Government of India, a measure which did not appear indispensable 'either for the organisation of effective judicial arrangements at Chiengmai or for the expediting of correspondence on questions affecting the interests of Her Majesty’s subjects in British Burma'. 38* The Foreign Office replied that they were prepared to authorise the Consul-General at Bangkok to despatch a Vice- Consul to Chiengmai upon the understanding that he should■FT 1 ’’™’'' 14. exercise his functions 'under the exclusive charge and control of Her Majesty’s Agent and Consul-General at Bangkok'. The 24th August India Office informed the Foreign Office in reply that they had no objection to such an arrangement 'provided it is not intended that all correspondence between the Vice-Consul and the local authority in the adjacent districts of British Burma is to be carried on through the circuitous and • • • sometimes wholly inaccessible channel of Bangkok* 39* 'The questions which arise at Chiengmai almost exclusively affect natives of British Burma or merchants resident in that province^ and, while the communication with Paphoon, the headquarters of the British Deputy Commissioner, is short and easy, with Bangkok it is long and difficult* 40. 'Unless, therefore, the Vice-Consul at Chiengmai is to be in full and free correspondence with British Burma, though of course subordinate to Her Majesty's Representative at Bangkok and taking instructions from him in all questions of a diplomatic nature and involving reference to the Siamese Government, Lord Hartington can anticipate from the appoint ment no advantage proportionate to the expense which it will entail upon Indian revenues.' 11th October 41* In reply to an enquiry as to whether the total expenses of the Vice-Consulate at Chiengmai would be accepted 24th November as a charge on Indian revenues, the Foreign Office were informed that 'the expense of the establishment and office contingencies which, in the opinion of the Government of India, may be necessary, as well as the Vice-Consul's salary, will be met from Indian revenues'® It was added, however, that it was extremely doubtful 'whether the Government of India would be prepared to agree to include amongst the expenses of the Consulate properly chargeable to the Indian Treasury, any pay ment on account of outfit to the Vice-Consul according to Consular Regulations'* It was further added that 'it will, of course, be understood that previous to the deputation of any gentleman from the Consulate at Bangkok to Chiengmai, the name of the officer selected will be submitted by Her Majesty's Agent and Consul-General for the approval of the Governor- General of India in Council, as arranged in the correspondence which passed in 1877'. The letter concluded as follows: 'It will also be understood that, as the arrangement is made for the purposes of the Government of India, who defray the whole expenses, it will be open to them to terminate it at any time if they find it necessary to do so**’ 42. It is interesting to find that Sir Louis Mallet, then Under Secretary of State at the India Office, noted on this correspondence as follows: 'I do not like this arrange ment. It is irregular and inconvenient that our Government should take upon itself the whole charge for an officer (and establishment) appointed by another Government and directed and controlled by that Government© The officer may be incompetent or insubordinate and the Government of India will be able to do nothing but remonstrate through the Foreign Office who will probably support their agent® Only one thing is certain - that India will have to pay an indefinite sum which the Foreign Office will have no interest in controlling. I think it should be a • • • condition of such an arrangement that the officer paid by India should be an officer of the Government of India.' 43.

In a letter dated 14th March 1881, the Government of India acknowledged the receipt of the Secretary of State's despatches and commented on the arrangement made as follows: 'The Vice-Consul at Chiengmai is to be paid from Indian revenues and his office has been established principally (if not wholly) for the protection of the interests of British Indian subjects. He must therefore be in constant corres pondence with the local authority in the adjacent districts of British territory and if he were obliged to do so through Bangkok • • * through the medium of a Consulate that is not well acquainted with Indian interests, and that has conse quently shown, occasionally, little regard for them, his utility in fulfilling the objects of his appointment will be largely curtailed* We trust that in any subsequent arrange ment which may be made with reference to the establishment of the-Vice-Consul and the definition of his duties, these con siderations may carry weight with Her Majesty’s Government . 45* The Government of India thereupon communicated with the Consul-General at Bangkok in accordance with the procedure agreed upon and the results of the ensuing corres pondence were communicated to the Secretary of State in a letter of the 26th August. Their concrete proposals were as follows:- Rs • Salary of Vice-Consul 6,000 per annum.

With regard to the filling of the post, it appears that Mr• Palgrave, then Consul-General at Bangkok, against whose behaviour the Government of India had constantly to remonstrate with the Foreign Office, disregarded the arrange ment whereby he was to submit for the Government of India's approval the name of the officer he proposed to depute to Chiengmai• The Government of India, however, while drawing attention to the irregularity of Mr* Palgrave's action, 'which might not improbably occasion inconvenience', stated that they had no objection to the appointment of Mr* Palgrave’s nominee — Mr* E*B.

The scheme for a fixed annual contri bution was, however, turned down by the Treasury, the Government of India being informed in a despatch dated 4th November• 55 • Meanwhile the India Office had been informed by the Foreign Office of a proposal that an Assistant to the Vice-Consul at Chiengmai should be appointed* The proposal was referred to the Government of India in a despatch dated 10th June and they replied on 11th September as follows: n The appointment of an Assistant to the Vice-Consul would * * * carry with it many advantages; and, if the arrangement could be made without additional cost to Indian revenues, we should be disposed to support Mr• Satow^ proposal. If, however, any considerable cost to Indian revenues is involved, we cannot in the existing state of the finances recommend the appointment.' The Foreign Office were therefore informed that 'the Secretary of State was not prepared to sanction any additional charge being incurred by India by an increase to the Consular establishment at Chiengmai.' 56. In the meanwhile further discussion had arisen between the India Office and the Foreign Office in connection with the payment inter alia of the furlough salary and travelling expenses due, under Consular Regulations, to Mr. French, who had recently been appointed to succeed Mr. Gould as Vice-Consul at Chiengmai but who had not yet proceeded to the post being entitled, after 5 years’ service at Bangkok, to a year’s furlough. The Foreign Office requested that the India Office should pay to Mr© French upon his arrival in this country the sums due to him under Consular Regulations on the ground that 'no funds have been placed by Parliament at the disposal of this Office for the Chiengmai Establishment.' The India Office pointed out in reply that, in the first place, Mr. French had earned the furlough to which he was entitled by service under the Foreign Office and that, in the second place, the Secretary of State was not prepared to abandon the principle that no payments on account of the Chiengmai Vice-Consulate should be made in this country by the India Office. In conclusion, however, it was suggested that the India Office might be prepared to make the necessary advances if the Treasury would withdraw their previous objections to the adoption of a fixed annual payment from Indian Revenues in respect of Chiengmai. 57. The views of the India Office were passed on by the Foreign Office to the Treasury who replied that it was important to determine whether the objections of the India Office were to payment in this country or to the payment itself of certain charges incurred in connection with the Chiengmai Vice-Consulate. 'If this' (i.e. the latter) 'be the ground of objection', wrote the Treasury rather curtly, 'it would be much better for the Secretary of State to hand Chiengmai, with its patronage and charges, over to the India Office entirely. 58. 'Parliament has provided nothing whatever for Chiengmai, but has been told that India pays for it. No risk must therefore be run of a charge being thrown on the Consular Vote in respect of this Vice-Consulate through the refusal of the India Office to pay certain expenses.' 9th February No.l4(Politica of 1887.

If, however, the objection of the India Office was only to payment in this country, the Treasury expressed their readiness to sanction the necessary advances by the foreign Office. They saw no reason, however, to alter their previous decision with regard to the proposal that India should dis charge her liability in respect of Chiongmai by a fixed annual payment. 60. The India Office appears to have been convinced by these arguments and to have reconciled itself, for the time being, to the responsibility for all the expenses incurred under Consular Regulations in connection with the Vice- Consulate at Chiengmai. The Foreign Office were accordingly requested to issue instructions for the advance to lir. French of the sums to which he was entitled and they were informed that the Government of India would bo instructed to refund these expenses 'at the rate fixed annually for the adjustment of transactions by the Imperial and Home Governments, on application being made to them by Her Majesty’s Minister at Bangkok.' The necessary instructions were conveyed to the Government of India in the Secretary of State’s despatch of the 10th February. 61. Before long, however, a further subject of dis cussion had arisen. In a letter of the 5th August 1887, the Government of India informed the Secretary of State tha^, in obedience to instructions from the Foreign Office, the Consul- General at Bangkok had preferred a claim for the refund of certain fees appertaining to the Vice-Consulate at Chiengmai, which had been credited to the Government of India. They expressed the opinion that 'as the whole cost for the main tenance of the Vice-Consulate is a charge upon this country, any income derived from fees should be credited oo Indian Revenues.' The Foreign Office were informed that Viscount Cross entirely concurred in this opinion and they were reminded that this principle had already been admitted in the case of the Zanzibar and Jeddah Consulates, where, the charges being paid equally by the Imperial and Indian Governments, the fees were likewise divided. The Foreign Office pointed out in reply, however, that in addition to the sums allotted from Indian Revenues for the maintenance of the Chiongmai Vice-Consulate, there were certain expenses in connection with that establishment which fell a.rom uime uo time upon Imperial funds and were not claimed from the Government of India, while, moreover, the officers in charge of the Vice-Consulate were earning pensions payable by the Imperial Government for services rendered to the Government of India, which bore no proportion of these expenses. They suggested, therefore, that in the circumstances and consider ing the small amount of the fees involved, they should be credited to the Consular Vote. This suggestion was referred to the Government of India in the Secretary of State’s des patch of 30th November. The Government of India replied, on the 14th February 1888, that, on the understanding that no claim would be made upon Indian Revenues in respect of the pensions of the officers who had discharged, or who might thereafter discharge, Consular functions at Chiengmai, they would raise no further objection to the credit to the Imperial Government of the fees levied at the Chiengmai Vice-Consulate, and the Foreign Office were informed accordingly. 62. In the same year the Government of India drew the Secretary of State’s attention, in a letter dated 27th November, to the unsatisfactory character of the arrangements made with regard to Chiengmai and communicated in the SecretaryParagraph 60. 16th January 1889 22nd February No*8(Political) of 1889. 19th September No .59(Political) of 1889 of State’s despatch No.14 (Political) of 1887. It will be remembered that it had been agreed that in all the arrangements in connection with Chiengmai* Consular Regulations should pre vail and that the necessary payments should be adjusted locally between the Minister at Bangkok and the Comptroller- General in India. The Government of India now pointed out that as they were not in a position to check the various items in the claims preferred to themr, or to verify thav the Regulations of the Consular Service had been complied v/ith, the arrangement was most unsatisfactory from their point of view. 63. In forwarding a copy of the Government of India’s letter to the Foreign Office, the India Office took uhe opportunity of pointing out that it was more than 3 years since Mr. French had been appointed Vice-Consul ab Chiengmai but that he had not yet proceeded to the post, which was still in the hands of Mro Archer, as acting Vice-Consul® In their reply the Foreign Office had to confess that the arrangements at Chiengmai were even less satisfactory than the India Office imagined, for Mr• Archer, the acting Vice-Consul, was now entitled to furlough and they proposed that a Student Inter preter should be sent up temporarily from the Consulate- General at Bangkok in his placeo In forwarding a copy of this correspondence to the Government of India, under cover of his despatch of 7th February, the Secretary of State wrote as follows:- ,! Should your Excellency’s Government consider that the temporary nature of the appointment to the Vice- Consulate at Chiengmai operates to the disadvantage of Indian interests, I should be prepared to consider any proposals which you may submit with a view to securing a more permanent representation of the office of Consul at Chiengmai. It was pointed out in the India Office that the Government of India appeared to be getting a very bad bargain at Chiengmai and that the time might not be far distant when the Vice- Consul at Chiengmai would be dispensed with ’and the chief political authority in those regions vested in an officer of the Indian Government resident in the trans-Salween Shan States o” 64o The Foreign Office, however, were no less dissatis fied than the India Office with the Consular arrangements in Siam which, in practice, gave rise to constant friction and difficulty, and in the following autumn they revived the suggestion, this time with Treasury consent, that the Chiengmai Vice-Consulate charges should be transferred to the Consular Vote and that India should discharge her liability by means of a fixed annual contribution© The sum they proposed was £1,450 (equivalent to Rs=21,090), based on a statement of the total expenditure claimed from India from, the date of the establishment of the Vice-Consulate down to the 31st March 1888, and it was suggested that the sum should be subject to revision after five years. 65. The Foreign Office proposals were referred to the Government of India in the Secretary of Ctase's despatch of the 24th October, the Government of India being asked at the same time ’’whether, with a view to ensuring a more adequate representation of Indian interests at Chiengmai t it might not be desirable, if the Siamese Government offered no objection thereto, that Your Excellency’s Government should nominate the officer to be stationed at that place who would, in this case, be in direct communication with you but still under the orders of the Minister resident at Bangkok in respect of his Consular ’No .38 (External) of 1890 5th June 27th October |iIo.72(Politica] of 1890 No .34(External of 1891 12th Larch Foreign Office to India 0ffic&lt; 14th April • India Office t&lt; Foreign Office 25th April • No •27(Politica! of 1891.It -will be the arrangements Lons should pre- adjusted 3 Comptroller- v pointed out le various items that the Dmplied with, heir point of So •SS(External) of 1890 ent of India’s took the han 3 years 1 at Chiengpiai which was still sul« In their he arrangements the India Office ul, was now Student Inter- Consulate- .ng a copy of under cover ■ of State wrote iment consider ;o the Vice- .ntage of Indian ly proposals . more permanent ingmai*” It rovernment of .n at Chiengmai in the Vice- md the chief i an officer of ilween Shan 5th Juno '27th October Ho • 72 (Po 1 it ic al) of 1890 Ho .34(External) of 1891 io less dissatis- irrangements in ; friction and 'evived the bhat the msferred to the her liability by jm they proposed a a statement of the date of the he 31st March i be subject to referred to the 3 s despatch of ng asked at the more adequate ai t it might not ed no objection ould nominate the Id, in this case, under the orders t of his Consular 12th March Foreign Office to India Office 14th April • India Office to Foreign Office 25th April • Ho •27(Political) of 1891* functions. The altered political condition of Upper Burma may perhaps, in your judgment, render such a change expedient'. 66. The Government of India, however, were not inclined to favour the latter suggestion. 'We are, on the whole,' they wrote on 8th April 1890, 'satisfied that the present arrangement should be allowed to continue. Chiengmai and Bangkok politics are so intimately connected that the attempt to place the Vice-Consul at the former place in direct relations with us would probably create inconvenient compli cations'. At the same time they expressed their readiness to accept the principle of a fixed annual contribution, the sum they proposed being Rs.14,500, to be paid by bills drawn by Her Majesty’s Minister at Bangkok upon the Calcutta Treasury, in order to avoid an increase to Home Charges. They also asked that the sum decided upon should not be subject to revision, for 'the Government of India will have no voice in sanctioning the future expenditure of the Vice-Consulate and it appears to us obviously undesirable that we should be liable to bo called upon hereafter to agree to a contribution which fluctuates in proportion to expenditure over which we have had no control'• 67. The Government of India’s counter-proposals were transmitted to the Foreign Office with the suggestion that any arrangement reached should be subject to reconsideration at the expiration of ten years. The Foreign Office met the Government of India’s proposals half-way with a request for a contribution of Rs.17,844, to be subject to revision after five years, and this request was transmitted to the Government on India in the Secretary of State’s despatch of the 27th November. 68. The Government of India pointed out in their reply, dated 18th February, 1891, that the sum proposed by the Foreign Office still included Rs.2,824 on account of the pay of the Student Interpreter at Bangkok, which they were not prepared to accept as a charge upon Indian revenues. The Foreign Office had argued that the payment had been forced upon the Imperial Government by the establishment of the Chiengmai Vice-Consulate and the large amount of Indian work devolving upon the Legation, and that India ought therefore to bear the cost. The Secretary of State, however, supported the Govern ment of India in this matter and the Foreign Office were in formed that the Secretary of State was prepared to sanction the payment of an annual contribution not exceeding Rs.15,020 towards the expenses of the Chiengmai Vice-Consulate, the sum to be subject to revision at the expiration of ten years, or five years if Her Majesty’s Government preferred the lesser term. 69. The sum of Rs.15,020 suggested by the Government of India was accepted by the Treasury and it was agreed that the new arrangement should have effect from the 1st April, 1891, and that it should hold good for five years. The Government of India were informed of the agreement reached in the Secretary of State’s Despatch of the 30th April. The annual contribution to be paid by the Government of India had been calculated as follows:-12th August 29th June 20th August 1st September Charges paid direct by the Government of India (excluding Outfit Charge of Rs.2,000) for four years 1884-5 to 1887-8. 53,235 Charges paid in Bangkok or London, and recovered by Bills drawn on Calcutta during the same period 13,092 66,327 Deduct.

Mr. Archer, the Acting Vice-Consul at Chiengmai, had suggested, in a despatch to the Foreign Office, that it was desirable to obtain a full and continuous supply of information on the course of events in the North Eastern Provinces of Siam, and in particular on the activities of the French on the borders of Indo-China. He, therefore, proposed that the Vioe- Consulate at Chiengmai should be elevated to the rank of a Consulate, and that its jurisdiction should be extended to Fo.ll(p 0 litica: cover the North Eastern Provinces, including Luang-Prabang. 1894.

Later in the same year the Foreign Office forwarded to the Indian Office a copy of a despatch from Mr. Scott, late Charge' d ! Affaires at Bangkok, enclosing a Memorandum on the necessity of establishing periodical district courts in different parts of the Consular district of Bangkok© In his despatch to the Government of India of 7th December 1894, the Secretary of State pointed out that / 'the main grounds on which the establishment of such period ical district courts is urged, are the ill-treatment of British subjects in the provinces by native officials and the difficulties attending the investigation of such cases, and also the depredation by British subjects, not amenable to Siamese jurisdiction, of teak timber being floated down the Menam river to Bangkok. 74. ”As it is understood that nearly all these British subjects are British Indians' (Mr. Scott had stated that there were probably between 3,000 and 4,000 Burmese and Shans engaged in ruby and sapphire mining in one district south-east of Bangkok alone) 'it is likely that the Foreign Office will in the event of any addition to the Consular establishment in Siam, require this Office to contribute towards the expenditure which the increased Consular staff will entail'. 75. The Secretary of State ! s expectations were soon fulfilled in the form of a request by the Foreign Office for a contribution from Indian revenues towards the expenses of a round tour of the districts in question by Mr© Black of the Consulate General, Bangkok, for the purpose of trying or investigating cases in which British subjects were concerned. The Government of India, however, to whom the Foreign Office request was referred in the Secretary of State's despatch of the 4th January, refused, in a letter dated 1st May, 1895, to admit either the necessity for the holding of periodical consular courts in the districts in question or the liability of Indian revenues for any portion of the expenses of Mr. Black's tour. With regard to the question of district courts, the Government of India forwarded a copy of a letter from the Chief Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Burma to the Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Depart ment, arguing that no case had been made out for the necessity of such periodical courts, either for the pro tection of British subjects or for their punishment. These arguments, which were described in the India Office as 'not very conclusive', were passed on to the Foreign Office, who replied by forwarding copies of two further despatches from the Bangkok Charge d'Affaires, 'showing', as they claimed, 'to what extent the Government of India are interested in the objects for which Mr. Black's recent tour was undertaken and in the establishment of new Consular posts in certain districts in Siam'© In the first of these two despatches, Mr. De Bunsen urged that 'in so far as Mr© Black's journey is political' (i©e. the investigation of French activities in Cambodia) r the Indian Government are served by it not less than the Home Government: in so far as it is judicial the Indian Government is exclusively interested © © . © © and in so far as it affords facilities for registration, a large Burmese population will profit by it' © He added, more-over, that the Consular staff which barely suffices to get through the business of the Consulate at Bangkok might be reduced considerably but for the British Indian population of Bangkok which is much given to litigation and engrosses almost the entire time of the courts'.

No *45(External) of 1896* 247-3-S-l dated 9th January 76* The Government of India, however, to whom the matter was again referred in the Secretary of State*s des patch of the 24th October, refused, in a letter dated 11th March 1896, to modify their previous decision, relying once again on the opinion of the Chief Commissioner of Burma, given in a letter to the Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, that so far as the interests of the people of that Province were concerned, a case had not been made out 'for saddling Indian revenues either with a share of the cost of Mr* Black’s tour, or with part of the cost of the establishment of periodical consular courts.' 77* The Government of India's letter was commented on in the India Office as follows 'There is no clear and well-recognised rule indicating the cases in which Indian revenues should be liable to con tribute towards expenditure incurred for, or in connection with. Imperial establishments outside India* Probably it would be impossible to formulate one* The consequent wrangles are very unsatisfactory, and there is a danger that action required by the interests of the two countries (England and India) taken together, may be neglected because there is a dispute as to which shall bear the cost' • 78* It seems to have been realised that the question of the incidence of this tour was of some importance as a precedent, and a note on the question prepared for the 16th April Political Committee contained the following observations: 'One objection to over-ruling the Government of India in this matter is that we are dealing piecemeal, not only in the case of Siam but also in respect of Western Yunnan, with the question of Indian contributions towards the expenses of the establishment of new Consulates and the extension of consular supervision* We have just agreed to pay a moiety of the salary and the allowance of the Consul to be appointed to Momein in Western Yunnan* 'As soon as the revision of the Burma-China Convention of 1894 is effected, further Consulates in Western Yunnan will be established and without doubt the Government of India will be called upon to bear a share of the expenses* 'Again, as a result of the Anglo-French Agreement of 15th January, we must anticipate the creation of additional consulates in Siam, and a consequent demand on Indian revenues for a contribution towards the expenditure so entailed* 'It is, therefore, suggested that the Foreign Office should be informed that the Secretary of State wishes to reserve his decision pending a consideration of thefinancial questions involved in the establishment of new Consulates in Western China and Siamo 6th May 25th June No «47(Political) of 1896. 2nd February 1897.

A compromise was eventually adopted, however, and the Foreign Office were informed that although the Government of India were not of the opinion that Indian revenues should be burdened with a share of the cost either of Mr. Black*s tour or of the establishment of periodical consular courts in Siam, the Secretary of State was willing 'as a special case, not to be treated as a precedent”^ to make a contribution of £100 from Indian revenues towards the cost of Mr« Black*s tour, 'in view of the circumstances and of the fact that the interests of a large number of British Indian subjects were affected by it'. The Foreign Office*, in accepting the Secretary of State's offer, acknowledged that by this con tribution he had met in an equitable manner the claim made on the India Office for half the cost cf the expenditure incurred on account of Mr© Black*s journey, but expressed Lord Salisbury*s regret at the refusal of the Government of India to bear any share of the cost of the establishment of con sular courts in Siamo The Government of India had been informed of the Secretary of State’s action in a despatch dated 7th May© 80« Meanwhile, the arrangement made in 1891, under which India contributed a fixed sum of Rs.15,020 towards the expenses of the Chiengmai Vice-Consulate, had expired on the 1st April 1896 and the Foreign Office, therefore, approached the India Office with regard to the renewal of the arrange ment for a further period© It will be recalled that in their letter of 8th April, 1890, the Government of India had asked that India’s fixed contribution in respect of Chiengmai should not be made subject to revision, on the ground that the Government of India would have no voice in sanctioning future expenditure on the Vioe-Consulate, and that it was not right that they should be called upon to agree thereafter to a contribution which fluctuated in proportion to expenditure over which they were to have no control* The Government of India's anxieties on this score proved to have been well justified for the Foreign Office now suggested that India's contribution should be increased to Rs.18,830. It appears that, although the Government of India had refused in 1894 to agree to contribute towards an increase of £150 in the salary of the Vice-Consul at Chiengmai during the currency of the existing arrangement, the Treasury had in fact sanctioned an increase of £200 which had taken effect from the 1st April, 1896© The Foreign Office now proposed, therefore, that the whole of this increase-, together with a due pro portion of the Non-Effective Chargesshould be charged to Indian revenues and continued till 31st March 1901, and that the Government of India’s contribution under various other heads should also be increased in accordance with the average actual expenditure of the previous five years © It is not surprising that these proposals should have given rise to the usual unseemly wrangling© The Foreign Office were informed that as the additional expenditure in respect of the Vice- Consul’s salary had been provided for in the English and not27 nent of new sm answer that towards these fc it will be a ia is iramed- with these d, however, and h the Government revenues should f lir.

No.591 - 3 S - 6 dated 18th May. 81. The Foreign Office proposals for the future were, at the same time, referred to the Government of India in a despatch dated 25th February, and by the Government of India to the Chief Commissioner of Burma, who was asked for his opinion as to 'whether, so far as purely Indian interests are concerned, the Chiengmai Vice-Consulate might not now be withdrawn'• In their reply to the Government of India, the Government of Burma declared that the political information supplied by the Vice-Consulate to the Government of India (under flying seal through the Government of Burma) had been mainly of an Imperial interest. The Reports had dealt, for the most part, with the proceedings of the French which, since the definition of the frontier between Burma and the French possessions on the Mekong, were of diminished interest from an Indian point of view. The Lieutenant- Governor would not, therefore, be prepared to advocate the retention at the cost of Indian revenues of an establishment at Chiengmai for the sole purpose of supplying political information. 82. The Government of Burma went on to point out, however, that while the nature of the Vice-Consul’s duties, under the treaties and agreements in force between Great Britain and Siam and under the Siam Order-in-Council of 1889, had not materially altered, the increased influx of British subjects due to the expansion of trade had doubtless rendered these duties more onerous. 'The legal business of the International Court' they wrote 'which deals with cases wherein British subjects are concerned under the provisions of the Treaty of 1883, has risen steadily from 59 cases in 1889 to 287 in 1895, and the amount claimed in civil suits from Rs.1,05,228 to Rs.10,11,416. The trade of the Con sular district not only with Moulmein and the Shan States, but even with Bangkok, is to a considerable extent controlled by British Indian subjects'. In view of these consider ations, they concluded, the Lieut-Governor was of the opinion that the Vice-Consulato at Chiengmai could not be withdrawn without serious detriment to the interests of the British Indian subjects (numbering several thousand) engaged in trade in the district, and that the Government of India should equitably pay a considerable share, though not the whole, of the expenses of the Vice-Consulate. 83. In their letter of the 15th June, 1897, the No.83(External) Government of India endorsed the views put forward by Sir of 1897. Frederic Fryer. As regards the supply of information of a political nature, they pointed out that there was now a British Political Officer, with an escort, at Keng Tung, and that expenditure from Indian revenues on the retention of an establishment at Chiengmai could not be justified on political grounds. They recognised, however, that in the interests of British Indian traders, the Government of India might equit ably continue to bear a share of the expenditure at Chiengmai, and they expressed their willingness to renew their previous contribution of Rs.15,020 until the 31st March, 1901. 'We are' they wrote 'decidedly opposed to any increased liability on this account being thrown upon the revenues of India'• 84. It was pointed out in the India Office that the Government of India’s arguments, at any rate on political28. 27th July. 11th September No.78(Political) of 1897. grounds, were not well put. The Mekong boundary settlement, for instance, had been of clear benefit to India and had made possible a reduction in inixitary expenditure. The Foreign Office were informed, however, of the Government of Indians views and of their offer to continue their former contribution and they replied as follows:- The Lords y Commissioners of the Treasury share Lord Salisbury’s regret that a decision should have been taken by which Indian revenues will no longer bear a fair proportion of the in«* creased expenditure on the post. Under the circumstances, however. Their Lordships have had no alternative but to agree to the offer of the Indian Government and have accord ingly sanctioned the acceptance of the same contribution as heretofore, namely Rs.15,020, for the period ending March 1901” . The Government of India were informed in the Secretary of State’s despatch of the 30th September that His Majesty’s Government had reluctantly accepted their offer. 85. It appears that, before the expiration of this further five year period, at the conclusion of which the Government of India’s contribution in respect of this post became merged in their general fixed contribution towards December.

In a letter dated the 23rd November, 1895, the Foreign Office drew th^ attention of the India Office to the provisions of Article XIII of the ’’Convention between Great Britain and China giving effect to Article III of the Convention of July 24th, 1886, relative to Burmah and Thibet”, which had been signed in London on March 1st and ratified on August 23rd, 1894, and suggested that as the proposed establishment of a Consulate at Manwyno was largely on account of Indian interests, the Government of India might equitably be invited to bear a moiety of all the expenditure involved. They added that Her Majesty's Minister, Peking, had recommended a salary of £800 Per annum for the post and allowances for wages and contingencies of £100 and £50 respectively. . December. 87. In their reply to this letter, the India Office quoted the following extract from a Report by Captuin H.R. Davies on a journey he had made in Yunnan in 1894-5:- ’’There is one point in the recent Convention between Great Britain and China which calls for notice. By this Convention it is agreed that a British Consul shall be placed at Manwyne (Manwaing) • This place must have boon decided on as the residence of a Consul under a misapprehension as to its importance. It is a village of only 100 houses, which has no trade in itself. Momein is the place from which nearly all the trade from Bhamo comes”. It was therefore suggested that as negotiations were in progress for the amendment of the Convention, an attempt should be made to have Article XIII modified so as to enable the proposed Consulate to be established at Momein instead of at Manwyne. 88. The insertion of Manwyne in the Convention had, as a matter of fact, not been due, as suggested by Captain Davies, to a misapprehension as to its importance, for it appears that at one time during the negotiations preceding the conclusion of the Convention, the Chinese Government had agreed to the establishment of Consulates both at Momoin and at Yungchang Fu, but that they had later withdrawn! their consent in respect of these places. * ”It is agreed that His Majesty the Emperor of China may appoint a Consul in Burmah, to reside at Rangoon; and that Her Britannic Majesty may appoint a Consul to reside at Manwyne; w and that the Consuls of the two Governments shall each within the territories of the other enjoy the same privileges and immunities as the Consuls of the most-favoured nation. Further, that in proportion as the commerce between Burmah and China increases, additional Consuls may be appointed by mutual agreement, to reside at such places in Burmah and Yunnan as the requirements of the trade may seem to demand. The correspondence between the British and Chinese Consuls respectively, and the chief authority at the place where they reside, shall be conducted on terms of perfect equality*”30.

Pending the necessary modification of the 1894 Convention, the Government of India were asked, in the Secretary of State’s Despatch of 6th December, for their views on the proposal that Indian revenues should be charged ’’with a moiety of the salary and allowances which it is intended to attach to the post'. Their reply, dated 11th March, 1896, was to the effect that while they admitted “the principle of joint liability” in respect of the proposed Consulate, they would prefer to have the expenditure estimated and to make a stipulated annual rupee contribution rather than to pay a fixed proportion of the cost. They pointed out that a similar arrangement had already proved convenient in the case of the Chiengmai Vice- Consulate . 90. The Foreign Office were, therefore, informed that “upon the establishment of a British Consulate at Momein, Lord George Hamilton will be prepared to charge Indian revenues with a moiety of the salary and allowances which it is proposed to assign to the post, namely £475 or Rs.7,600 at an exchange of Is.3d. the rupee”. It was pointed out in the India Office at the time, however, that with the example of Chiengmai before them, the Treasury would be likely to demand a contribution towards the Non-Effective Charges also, and that the Government of India appeared to have accepted an obligation in this respect by admitting the principle of joint liability. 91. The India Office offer was referred by the Foreign Office to the Treasury, who enquired whether the statement of the Indian moiety in rupees was intended only as an illustration. 'We presume' they wrote 'that the actual payment will be governed by the rate of exchange annually fixed for the settle ment of claims between the Home and Indian revenues'. The Foreign Office were informed by the India Office in due course that the rate of Is.3d. had been adopted by way of illustration and in order to give some idea of the probable cost to which the India Office would be willing to agree and that any contribution that might be agreed upon would be made either in sterling or preferably in India by meeting Bills drawn by the Consul on the Controller-General, Calcutta. 92. A despatch from Her Majesty's Representative, Peking, dated 28th October, 1895, and copied to the India Office on 18th December, had thrown some light on the objects with which it was proposed to establish a Consul in Western Yunnan. 'I do not anticipate' wrote Sir Nicholas 0’Conor 'any immediate settlement of British traders in Yunnan of a nature to necessitate that the Consul should reside the year through at Manwyne. Apart from the situation and climate, which I understand to be particularly unhealthy in the hot season, it would, I think, be useful to keep in view the stipulation in Article XIII of the Convention of March 1st, 1894, referring to other places in Yunnan, which the requirements of trade may open to British enterprise, and I would therefore, suggest that the Consul might not be fettered to his post at Manwyne, but should be given freedom to travel at appropriate seasons to Tali, Yunnan Fu and Ssu-mao, and other considerable trading centres, where he cou d not fail to gather information of value to our merchants* I am all the more anxious to press this point on Your Lordship’s attention, in that I hear from a private source that French goods are becoming much more common than formerly in the markets of Yunnan and Kweichou'.

It will also be recalled that the Convention of 1894, under which the new post in Western Yunnan was^to be established, had been designed to give effect to Article III of the 'Convention of July 24th, 1886, between Great Britain and China relating to Burmah and Thibet', and that its object was, therefore, the delimitation of the Sino-Burmese frontier and the regulation and development of the growing trade between the two countries. 94. Meanwhile, the negotiations with the Chinese Government for the modification of the Convention of 1894 had been pro ceeding, and an 'Additional Agreement' ms eventually signed at Peking on the 4th February 1897, ratifications being exchanged on the 5th June. In this Instrument the following addition was made to Article XIII of the original Convention:- 'The Chinese Government agrees to allow the Government of Burma to station a Consul at Momein or Shulling-Fu as the Government of Burma may prefer, instead of at Manwyne, as stipulated in the original Convention, and also to station a Consul at Ssu-mao. British subjects and persons in British protection may establish themselves and trade at these places under the same conditions as at the Treaty Ports in China. The Consuls appointed as above shall be on the same footing as regards correspondence and inter-course with Chinese officials, as the British Consuls at the Treaty Ports'. 95. In a despatch dated 5th May 1897, the Foreign Office had informed Her Majesty’s Representative at Peking that pro vision had been made in the estimates of the current year for a Consul at Momein, and that, pending the ratification of the Agreement of the 4th February, they would be glad to receive his recommendation for filling the post. The India Office were later informed by the Foreign Office that a Consul had already been appointed and ms under orders to proceed to Momein. 96. Towards the end of the following year, the Foreign Office forwarded to the India Office a statement of expenses incurred in respect of the Consulate at Momein during the year 1897-8, with the request that the Secretary of State for India would issue instructions for the transfer to the Diplomatic and Consular Vote of a sum of £308.16.lid., being a moiety of the total expenditure. It was explained that although the Consul’s outfit had not been taken into account in estimating the annual contribution from Indian revenues, it ms a necessary charge and payable on appointment in accordance with the Regulations, and the hope was expressed that the Secretary of State would not object to its being included in the computation, seeing that the * 'The frontier between Burmah and China to be marked by a Delimitation Commission and the conditions of frontier trade to be settled by a Frontier Trade Convention, both countries agreeing to protect and encourage trade between China and Burmah.' x Consul’s outfit £265. 0. 0.

It was pointed out in the India Office that as the Government of India had accepted the principle of u Joint liability' in respect of the Momein Consulate, a contribution towards the Consul ! s outfit appeared to be admissible, and the Foreign Office were informed that instructions had been given for the transference of the required sum to the Paymaster-General. 97• In September 1899, the India Office were informed by the Foreign Office that owing to representations by Mr. Jamieson, Acting Consul at the post, it was proposed in future to use the name Tengyueh, instead of Momein, in all official communications. 98. On the 1st December 1899, a sum of £406.8,10d. was transferred by the India Office to the Diplomatic and Consular Vote in respect of expenditure incurred at Tengyueh during the year 1898-9. The expenses incurred at the post during the year 1899-1900, however, amounted to £l,030.1.5d., and the Foreign Office therefore suggested that as a moiety of this sum was in excess of the limit of £475 agreed to as the contribution from Indian revenues, a sum of exactly £475 should be transferred to the Diplomatic and Consular Vote in respect of that year nn d this was agreed to by the India Office. 99. It will be recalled that in the fixed annual contri bution of £6,000 from Indian revenues towards diplomatic and consular expenditure generally, which was agreed upon as a result of the recommendations of the Welby Commission, the contribution in respect of Tengyueh was stated to be £474 and that the present contribution, for which the liability has now been trans ferred to the Government of Burma, amounts to only £410. The reduction appears to have come about in the following way. 100. It will be remembered that the actual items comprising the general contribution suggested by the Foreign Office in 1900 amounted to £6,064, but that for convenience the contribution was fixed at tho round sum of £6,000. After certain of the items, namely tho contributions in respect of Kerman and Basra, had been eliminated, and when the remaining sum came to bo analysed later on into its component parts, the combined contri bution in respect of Jeddah and Tengyueh was held to amount to £1,200. The combined contribution in respect of these two posts should, however, have amounted to £1,264, (i.e. £790 plus £474) but the odd £64 appears to have been subtracted, for no obvious reason, from this particular item of the general contri bution. In 1929 the Foreign Office were asked for their views as to the relative allocation, as between Jeddah and Tengyueh, of this joint contribution and in their reply referred to corres pondence in 1910 in which the Government of India* s contribution in respect of Jeddah had been held to be £790. It therefore followed that the contribution in respect of Tengyueh amounted to only £410 and this is, therefore, the sum for which the Government of Burma have accepted the liability. Paragraph 1.

In addition to the fixed contributions of £1,000 and £410 in respect of Chiengmai and Momein respectively, the Government of Burma have agreed to take over from the Government Paragraph 1. of India the liability for a moiety of the expenses incurred at the consular post at Lakhon and a moiety of certain additional expenses incurred at Chiongmai, and the origin of these additional contributions in respect of consular expenditure in Siam must now be investigated. P.2565/04. 102. On 21st April, 1904, the Foreign Office forwarded to the India Office a copy of a despatch from Mr. Stringer, Consul at Chiengmai, in which stress ms laid on the increasing trading and other interests of British subjects in the Chiengmai district of Siam and two alternative methods were suggested for their protection and development:- (a) The posting of Consular Assistants to Chiengmai, Chiengrai and Lakhon, (b) the establishment of a Vice-Consul 'at Lakhon, who should pay regular visits to Chiengrai and other important centres. The Foreign Office declared themselves in favour of the second of these alternatives and in asking the Government of India for their views by telegram the Secretary of State for India added: m Ne shall presumably be asked to pay cost on Chiengmai precedent if appointment is sanctioned”• The Government of India replied, P.1115/04. on 17th June, as follows: ”We think that Vice-Consuls should be posted both at Lakhon and Chiengrai but if only one officer be appointed we would place his headquarters at Chiengrai to allow of constant touch with Keng Tung and the French frontier.' On P.2974/04. 6th August the Foreign Office informed the India Office that the Treasury had sanctioned the appointment of one additional Vice- Consul to the Siam Consular Establishment, to reside at Lakhon or Chiengrai, together with the estimated cost of maintaining a Consular Establishment at either of these two posts, the approxi mate expenses amounting in all to about £900 per annum; it was added that the cost would be taken into account in preparing the annual statement of expenditure for division between the Imperial and Indian Governments. The Government of India were accordingly I\io.95 [Political] informed, in the Secretary of State’s despatch of 2nd September, of 1904, No,38, [Secret] of 1905. P *3565/05. that a moiety of the cost of the proposed new post would be chargeable to Indian revenues. 103. Intermittent correspondence on the subject of consular arrangements in the Chiengmai district continued, however, to be carried on throughout the next two years. In deference to the Government of India’s view that consular officers should be stationed both at Chiengrai and Lakhon, the Foreign Office eventually decided to transfer to Lakhon a Consular Assistant hitherto stationed at Nan. In view of representations from Mr. Paget, the Consul-General in Bangkok, however, as to the political importance of the post at Nan for the purpose of watching the proceedings of the French in Upper Siam, the Government of India were asked in the Secretary of State’s despatch of 24th November 1905, whether they were prepared to reconsider their previous refusal to contribute towards tho cost of a thirdr 34.

Consular Assistant to be stationed at Nan, which they had announced in their letter of 18th May. The Government of India referred the matter to the Government of Burma who pointed out in their reply, dated 19th February, that the importance of Nan was political while that of Lakhon was commercial. 'At Nan 15 -wrote the Chief Secretary 'information may be obtained of the doings of the French, but there is little ordinary consular work. At Lakhon there are many British subjects and there is, presumably, a considerable amount of judicial work and of business connected with the registration of British subjects and the issue of certificates It appears, however, to His Honour that the political importance of Nan, whatever it may be, is more of a British than of a British-Indian interest . The Government of Burma, therefore, suggested that if it were decided to station a consular officer at Lakhon as well as at Chiengrai, the Government of India might equitably bear half the cost of the additional appointment but that in no case should the Government of India bear any of the cost of establishing a consular officer at Nan. In a letter to the Secretary of State dated 29th March, 1906, the Government of India expressed concurrence in the Government of Burma* s attitude and announced their willingness to bear half the net cost of the consular appointments both at Chiengrai and at Lakhon. The Foreign Office were informed accordingly in a letter dated 29th May. P,2809/10. P.4843/13. * Paragraph 69 P.2846/07. P.823/07. 104. On March 27th, 1907, the Foreign Office forwarded to the India Office a copy of a despatch from the Embassy at Bangkok pointing out that in practice there had proved to be very little consular work to be done at Chiengrai, where the number of British subjects was small and British trade practically non-existent, and urging the transference of the Consular Assistant from Chiengrai to Nan, where many British subjects from Burma held important interests in the teak forests and a considerable proportion of the general import and retail trade was in British hands. 'If' wrote Mr. Wood, the Assistant at Chiengrai, 'for some occult reason the Government of India are determined that a consular officer must be kept idling about at Chiengrai, I have the honour to suggest that it is most undesirable to meet their wishes by abolishing the Nan post'. The matter was referred to the Government of India who replied that, while they did not desire to press for the retention of a Vice-Consul at Chiengrai, they still considered that a consular officer at Nan was not required by Indian interests. P.869/14 No.35 [Polit of 1914. P.3305/07. P.1451/07. 105. On July 12th, the Foreign Office put forward a further proposal, namely, that on the abolition of the Vice-Consulate at Chiengrai, a Vice-Consul should be appointed at Chiengmai, who would be able to visit the Western districts every two years. 'As the tours in the Western district are made purely in Indian interests.,' wrote the F reign Office 'I am to enquire whether the Government of India -would be willing to contribute, out of the saving effected at Chiengrai, a fixed sum, say £350 or £400, towards the maintenance of the new post and to cover all outgoings.' Reference was once again made to the Government No.94- [Establishme: 1914. P•4939/22. P.2855/09. of India who replied that they agreed to contribute £350 a year towards the cost of an additional Vice-Consul at Chiengmui 'on the understanding that he will visit the Western districts.' This annual contribution in respect of the Vice-Consulate at Chiengmai was intended to include provision for inter alia a house allowance of £60 for the Vice-Consul pending the building of a Vice-Consulate, and it was, therefore, later reduced from £350 to £320 (i.e. by a moiety of £60), after the Government ofP,2809/10.

India had contributed a moiety (£868) of the cost of acquiring a site for the Vice-Consulate and erecting a suitable building. 106. In November, 1913, the Foreign Office informed the India Office that it was proposed to erect, at a cost of £1,500, a new Consulate building at Chiengmai in place of what had formerly been the Vice-Consulate building, which was considered unsatisfactory. The latter had been built between 1884/88, entirely at the expense of Indian revenues, and India had also borne the whole cost of its maintenance till 1891 when the post had been transferred to the Consular estimates on the adoption of the principle of a fixed contribution from Indian revenues. The Foreign Office now suggested that in the cir cumstances the cost of erecting the new Consulate building should bo met out of Indian funds. In their reply to the Foreign Office, dated 16th January, 1914, the India Office pointed out, however, that when the annual contribution from Indian revenues on account of Chiengmai was fixed at Rs.15,020 (£1,000 approximate) a sum of Rs.1,004 (£67) had been included as representing (476 for annual maintenance and 4% for renewal) on the total original outlay (Rs.12,548 = £836) on erecting and furnishing the Consular building. 'It would thus appear inequitable' they continued 'that the Indian exchequer should bear any proportion of the cost of renewing the building on its present scale but as the estimated cost of the new Consulate exceeds by some £664' (i.e. £1,500 less £836) 'that of the original building, the Secretary of State in Council is prepared, in the special circumstances of the case, to contribute one half of this excess, namely a sum of £332, towards the proposed expenditure*' 107. The Foreign Office accepted the contribution offered by the India Office, but in their reply, dated 5th March, they enquired 'whether, in view of the increased value of the Consulate after rebuilding, tho Marquess of Crewe would be prepared to increase tho contribution of the Indian Government in respect of the maintenance and renewal from £67 per annum (Q% of £836) to £120 per annum (being Q% of £1,500). This suggestion was referred to the Government of India in the Secretary of State’s despatch of 3rd April, in which it was suggested that an alternative arrangement would be for India to pay half the actual cost of repairs year by year and half the cost of renewals as they become necessary. It appears to have been overlooked that the fixed annual contribution of £1,000 still purported to include the 8% allowance on the cost of the original building to cover maintenance and renewal and that under the proposed alternative arrangement, unless the fixed contribution were reduced by £67 to £933, India would, in effect, be paying twice over for a certain proportion of the cost of maintaining the Consulate. The Government of India, however, in their letter of 30th July, agreed to the adoption of the proposed arrangement and half the actual cost of ordinary repairs and half the cost of renewals as they occurred thereby came to be paid annually by the Government of India, under the head 'Addi tional Expenses at Chiengmai.' 108. In a letter to the Foreign Office, dated 11th January 1923, the India Office pointed out, with regard to the sum of £320 claimed annually by the Foreign Office as the Indian contri bution towards the cost of the Vice-Consulate established at Chiengmai in 1906, that this post no longer appeared in the Foreign Office list of salaried consular officers and that the list for October 1913 was the latest list in which it had appeared as being filled. It transpired from subsequent correspondence36. P.1448/23 P.3088/23 that the post of Vice-Consul at Chiengmai had in fact been abolished in 1913 and that since that date India had, therefore, been making a present of £320 a year to Imperial revenue. It was pointed out by the India Office that the payment had been made definitely and explicitly for the full time services of a Vice-Consul at Chiengmai and that it had been intended to represent a moiety of the cost of that appointment. 'If, however,” they wrote ”a definite statement of expenditure, such as pay of clerical staff or menials, which can be considered to appertain definitely to the Vice-Consulate as opposed to the Consulate, is furnished for the years in question, Lord Peel will be prepared to consider the acceptance, as e. charge upon Indian revenues, of a moiety of such expenditurej” It was eventually agreed that the Foreign Office should make the necessary refund (approximately £1,413) to Indian revenues in respect of the extinct Vice-Consulate and that in return a sum of £126 (approximate) should be accepted as a charge upon Indian revenues, being a moiety of the sum spent on the salary of a Burmese clerk who had been appointed in 1916 to perform some of the work previously performed by the Vice-Consul. A moiety of the salary and allowances of this Burmese clerk continues to comprise a further item under the head ^Additional Expense at Chiengmai”, the liability for which has now been accepted by the Government of Burma.

It appears that after the erection of the new Consulate building in 1913/14 portions of the paddy land which surrounded the former Consulate building (i.e. the original Vice-Consulate building) and some of the old materials from the building itself were sold from time to time, a moiety of the proceeds being credited to Indian revenues. Finally, what remained of the building appears to have been sold during the financial year 1921/22 for £70 (approximate) 0 During the financial year 1926-7 the Foreign Office sold, without obtaining the Government of India’s consent, the Vice-Consulate building at Chiengmai whose erection had been sanctioned in 1910 and of which the Government of India had contributed a moiety of the cost. A moiety of the proceeds of the sale (£830.17.2) was, however, credited to Indian revenues. There now remains in Chiengmai, therefore, as the joint property of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, the Consulate building whose construction was sanctioned in 1913.37. X.

With the exception of a 50/£ contribution by H.M.G. towards the Vice-Consul’s travelling allowance, the whole cost of the Consulate-General at Kashgar, where a Consul-General and a Vice-Consul are stationed, is borne by the Government of India. With regard to the staffing of this post, the present position is that the Consul-General is a member of the Indian Political Service, while the Vice-Consul is a member of the China Consular Service.

It will be remembered that, as a part of the settlement reached as a result of the recommendations of the Welby Commission, the Treasury and Foreign Office had agreed to 'forego'^the annual contribution from Indian revenues in respect of the China Consular Establishments which had been fixed by the Foreign Office Confer ence (1891) at £12,500. P. 3554/23. 117. In a letter dated 17th September 1923, however, the Foreign Office informed the India Office that the amount of the Government of Indian 'contribution' under this head had recently been under discussion between the Foreign Office and the Treasury, and they proceeded to put forward a reasoned case for an increased contribution from Indian revenues. They pointed out that the Welby Commission had recognised that the prime factor in determin ing what proportion of the expenditure should be borne by the Government of India, was the relative interest of India and Great Britain in the trade with China. If, they argued, India’s trade with China had maintained the same proportion to Imperial trade generally as existed in 1899-1900, they would see reasonable grounds for asking the Government of India to increase the amount of their contribution, in view of the depreciation in the value of money, and the consequent increase in the cost of maintaining diplomatic and consular establishments. Figures showed that, although Indian trade with China had on the whole failed to main tain its former proportion, chiefly, it was to be presumed, owing to the opium restrictions which came into force in 1918, the propor tion of Indian trade with China had fallen off only slightly since 1900 as compared with Great Britain’s. The Foreign Office, therefore, expressed the hope that the Government of India would agree to raise the amount of their contribution from £12,500 to £20,000 per annum. 29th November. 118. This proposal was referred to the Government of India, who telegraphed in reply, from the Foreign and Political Depart ment, as follows:- P.1009/24. 'India’s contribution of £12,500 a year on account of Chinese Consular Establishments apparently ceased with effect from 1st April 1901, and unless the contribution has been revived under later arrangements, regarding which the Government of India does not appear to have any information, the proposals contained in Foreign Office letter of 17th September last would seem to call for further examination.” 2nd April 1924 119. In their reply to this telegram, the India Office referred the Government of India to a telegram despatched to their Finance Department on the same date, in reply to a separate enquiry on the general subject of contributions from Indian revenues towards consular expenditure. The passage in this telegram relating to the China Consular Establishments was as follows :- Since 1901 India nominally contributes nothing, but has all along been regarded by my predecessors and the Treasury as con tributing £12,500, nominal surrender of this contribution being part of contribution made by Treasury at request of this Office inNo. 15 (Finance) of 1924.

The views of the Government of India on the Foreign Office proposal were communicated to the Secretary of State in a despatch dated 10th July. The very existence of the payment, they declared, had been overlooked owing to the fact that it was not shown separately in the annual accounts, and they expressed their gratitude to the Foreign Office for drawing attention to a payment which had originally been based on considerations, namely, the East India Company’s monopoly of British trade with China and the Indian opium traffic with China, neither of which remained valid. In a short historical summary they pointed out that before 1834 the expenses of the Consular Establishments in China were not a direct charge on Government revenues (either British or Indian) but were recovered by means of a duty imposed on all British tonnage and goods entering Chinese ports. These expenses were thrown on the general funds of the Empire in 1834, when it was decided that it should be divided between India and Great Britain in the ratio of 1 : 2. 'Apparently” wrote the Government of India 'the East India Company’s monopoly of British trade with China led to the decision that a share should be paid by the Company'• 121. It might have been proper, they argued, to make a trading corporation like the East India Company pay the charge which was originally in substitution for a duty levied on all British ships entering Chinese ports where British Superintendents were stationed, but it was hardly correct to impose it on the Indian taxpayer. 'it appears all the less equitable' they continued 'when it is seen that it is the carrying trade, so largely in British hands, rather than the Indian producer that requires the protection and assistance of the British Diplomatic and Consular Officers in China, and the direct commercial assistance or intelligence that India receives from them is very slight, and has been so since the final extinction of the opium trade. 122. lt We must also point out that the levy of such a charge seems to be contrary to the general practice of the British Empire. In no case, so far as we know, has a Dominion or Colony been required to contribute to the cost of British diplomatic and consular establishments in foreign countries, and if we may make a comparison, India’s interest in China is surely not stronger than Canada’s in the United States of America. Moreover, the levy of a charge of this sort appears to be contrary to the spirit of Resolution 4 (A)(1) of the Imperial Economic Conference, 1923, H in accordance with which the services of His Majesty’s Commercial Diplomatic officers in foreign countries are placed at the disposal of the Governments of the Dominions and India. 123. 'So much for our commercial interests in China; as for political interests, it is no exaggeration to say that they are confined to Chinese Turkestan, the Burma frontier, and in a more remote degree to the Inner Tibetan frontier, but these special interests are, we think, not inadequately met by our upkeep of the Kashgar Consulate-General, and our contribution to the Tengyueh Consulate. Y/e have no voice whatever in shaping 35 A copy of Resolution 4 (A)(1) will be found in Appendix III to this Memorandum, together with relevant extracts from the Proceedings of the Imperial Economic Conference, 1923.40 policy in China (except in the particular case of Tibet, on •which account we maintain at our own expense a considerable staff) and we cannot doubt that if the question of our financial liability were to be decided dispassionately on its ^ ^ merits, the decision would surely be that India's liability is no more than that of any one of the Dominions.” 124. The only argument for the continuance of the contribution which the Government of India were prepared to recognise, was a historical one, namely that India had made such a contribution for 90 years, but they urged that the Secretary of State should endeavour to induce the Foreign Office and the Treasury to agree to its cessation. 125. It was suggested in the India Office that a distinction had to be drawn between treatment of the case:- P.6491/29 (1) on the merits, as between England and India alone, and (2) with reference to the treatment by England of other members of the Empire. As regards (1) - in view of the importance and growth of India’s trade with China, of the proximity of the two countries, and of the increasing political interests attaching to the Pacific, there was a strong case for the continuance of the contribution, the question of the amount being, of course, subject to examination. Unless, therefore, Indian expenditure on Tibet, Kashgar and Tengyueh was considerable, the Government of India’s claim to exemption from contributing towards the cost of the China Consular Establishments generally, would have to be based solely upon the exceptional treatment of India as compared with the Dominions, and the Resolution of the Imperial Economic Conference. P 3148/24. 126. In forwarding a copy of the Government of India’s despatch to the Foreign Office, the India Office wrote as follows ”The Secretary of State in Council agrees with the Government of India that, in view of the treatment accorded to the other Dominions and Colonies of the Empire, of the terms of Resolution 4 (A)(1) of the Imperial Economic Conference 1923 to which they refer, and of the fact that the Kashgar Consulate in whole, and the Tengyueh Consulate in part, are maintained from Indian revenues, which also bear the cost of a considerable staff for dealing with Tibetan affairs, the annual contribution of £12,500 made by India towards the cost of diplomatic and consular establishments in China, should now cease, and he would propose accordingly, that the rebate of this amount afforded by this Office to the Treasury in the division of the cost of the Secretary of State’s establishment^ should terminate on the 31st March next.” 127. The question was continually blocked, however, by the Foreign Office and the Treasury, on the ground inter alia that it could not be considered apart from the larger problem of Indian contributions to Home Effective and Non-Effective No. 11 (Finance) military charges, until it was raised again by the Government of 1929- of India in a despatch dated 4th July 1929. They declared P*4828/29. themselves unable to agree that it was either necessary or right41 ( 2&lt;*4 that consideration of this question should be suspended in the manner proposed. 'There can be no connection of any kind' they wrote 'between the question of India’s obligation to contribute towards the cost of training British troops to be employed in India on the one hand, and the liability of India to contribute ^ towards the cost of British diplomatic and consular representa tion in China on the other hand.' After reiterating their former arguments against the continuance of the contribution, they suggested that the Secretary of State would be justified in giving notice forthwith that the contribution would be discontinued after the current financial year. 128. It was pointed out in the India Office that the Secretary of State was not in a position to act in the manner suggested by the Government of India owing to the fact that the Government -of India’s contribution took the form of a rebate on the Treasury contribution towards the expenses of the India P.6491/29. Office. The India Office approached the Treasury, however, in a letter dated 11th December, in which they endorsed the Government of India’s contention that the contribution could no longer be justified on any ground of principle. 12 9. 'From the point of view of commercial interests' 1 , they wrote 'there seems to be no reason why His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom should require from India alone a contribution tov/ards the cost of the services which are placed freely at the disposal of the other parts of the Empire, and the anomaly of doing so is increased by the Resolution No. 4(A)(1) of the Imperial Economic Conference of 1923, which formally recorded the offer of His Majesty’s Government to place the services of His Majesty’s Diplomatic and Consular Officers at the disposal of the Governments of the Dominions and India. For this reason the comparison of the amounts of Indian and British trade with China.,, appears to have little relevance to the question of the contribution at the present time, whatever may have been the case at the date of the Welby Commission. I am to point out, however, that according to trade statistics compiled in this Office, the total value of the direct trade of Great Britain, Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements, and of India, with China, for the average of the seven years from 1922-3 to 1928-9, was about £112,000,000, and the Indian share of this amount about £12,100,000, the proportion of the Indian trade to the total thus being slightly less than one ninth. 130. 'India’s special political interests in China, on the other hand - which incidentally must also be regarded as in some measure British interests - are almost exclusively confined to the two border provinces of Sinkiang and Yunnan, and to Tibet. As regards these areas, India bears the total cost of maintaining the Consulate General in Kashgar, which in the budget estimates for 1929 to 1930 amounts to Rs.102,000 (say £7,650). An annual contribution of £410 is made towards the cost of the Consulate at Tengyueh. To safeguard relations with Tibet, a certain additional cost is imposed on Indian revenues in connection with the staff employed in the frontier state of Sikkim and elsewhere. The cost of relations with Sinkiang and Tibet thus already falls exclusively on Indian revenues, which also make a contribution towards consular expenditure in Yunnan. In these circumstances, there is evidently no justification from the political point of view for a separate contribution to the cost of Diplomatic and Consular Services in China proper, more especially as it has never been the practice, so far as Mr. Benn is aware, for any of the Dominions or Colonies, whatever their special interests, to42. P.5105/32. P.5105/32. 12th January 1933. contribute to the cost of the diplomatic or consular services maintained in foreign countries by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom; and the fact that some of the Dominions may now maintain services of their own, in countries where they consider that their interests warrant such expenditure, does not offer any p justification for imposing on Indian revenues c. contribution towards expenditure over which the Government of India have no control and which has very little relation to any Indian interests.” 131. ”0n all grounds, therefore,' they concluded 'Mr. Benn considers that there is a clear case for discontinuing the contribution, and he accordingly proposes that the rebate of the Treasury contribution towards the cost of the Secretary of State’s Establishment hitherto afforded in respect of the China contribution should cease forthwith.' 132. The question continued to be blocked by the Treasury, however, until 1932, when they agreed that, as from the 1st April 1933, the grant-in-aid of the expenses of the India Office should no longer be abated by £12,000 (not £12,500) in respect of the China Consulates. 133. In the meanwhile the Government of India had drawn the Secretary of State’s attention, in a letter dated 3rd August 1932, to the fact that for reasons of economy, the British Government had recently made certain reductions, by way of cuts in pay etc., in the cost of those diplomatic and consular establishments towards which the Government of India contributed, and that the Government of India were therefore entitled to a corresponding reduction in their contribution. It was admitted that the Government of India’s share would be automatically reduced in cases where they paid a proportion of the actual expenditure, and that their suggestion, therefore, only referred to those cases in which they paid a fixed contribution. 134. In their reply, the India Office reminded the Government of India that the fixed payments made at that time by the Government of India towards the cost of diplomatic and consular expenditure were as follows :- On account of Chiengmai £1,000. 0. 0. On account of Jeddah 790. 0. 0. On account of Tengyueh (Momein) 410. 0. 0. On account of Persia, (remnant of general contribution) 487.10. 0. TOTAL £2,687.10. 0. They pointed out that the contribution in respect of Persia, which was still intended to equalise expenditure as it stood in 1900, could not possibly be affected by the present proposal. With regard to the other items, they reminded the Government of India of the enormous rise in the cost of salaries and other expenditure connected with the Consulates which had taken place since the time when the amount of the Government of India's contribution had been fixed, and gave it as their opinion that there was a grave risk that if the question of a rebate were raised with His Majesty’s Government, they might reply with a request for an increase, which it might in the long run provedifficult to resist. For this reason, therefore, and in view of the insignificance of any saving to Indian revenues which was likely to be effected, it was suggested that it would be preferable not to make any approach to His Majesty's Government in the matter.SUGGESTED CONTRIBUTIONS FROM INDIAN REVENUES. 135. From time to time the Foreign Office have made unsuccessful attempts to obtain further contributions from Indian Revenues towards the cost of various Consular posts at which it was claimed that a considerable proportion of the work was done either on behalf of the Government of Irdia or the Government of Burma, or on behalf of Indian or Burman British subjects. The following in star ce s of this kind may be cited:- REVIVAL OF BASRA CONSULATE Paragraph 30. 136. It will be remembered that the British Consulate at Basra, in respect of which the Government of India had formerly made an annual contribution of £1400 to Imperial Revenues, had been closed in 1914 on the outbreak of war with Turkey and that in 1923 the Foreign Office had agreed to refund the contributions which had continued to be made from Indian Revenues in respect of the post and to make the necessary reduction in the Government of India’s basic contribution towards diplomatic and consular expenditure in the future. P.1893/24. 137. On April 26th, 1924, however, the Foreign Office informed the India Office that the question of re-establishing a British Consulate at Basra was under consideration, and they enquired whether the Secretary of State for India would see his way to reviving the former contribution made by the Government of India towards the maintenance of the post. 138. The Foreign Office enquiry was referred to the Government of India, who replied by telegram as follows:- P.3350/24 ’’The approximate number of Indians in Basra is 400 as against 200 other British subjects, but the value of Indo-Iraq trade for the last 3 years was 6^ millions sterling as against 16-|- for the United Kingdom. ”Gn commercial grounds Consular representation is necessary, but we consider that India should not be asked to contribute towards the Consular expenditure unless the Dominions do likewise, such contributions being contrary to the spirit of Resolution 4(A)(l)^ Imperial Economic Conference, 1923. ”lf necessary, we should prefer, as matter of principle and in spite of expenditure being possibly greater, to appoint, as in Jeddah, our own representative, either Vice-Consul or Agent under Section l y ~ of Indian Emigration Act’’. P.4876/24 139. The issues raised by the Government of India’s telegram were considered in the India Office in conjunction X 'The Governor General in Council may for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of emigrants in any place outside British India, appoint persons to be agents in such places, and may define their powers and duties.”Paragraphs 116-134 P. 4876/24 P.1103/25 r (lu) 45 o with the somewhat similar issues involved in the Foreign Office proposal that the Government of India’s contribution in respect of the China Consular Establishments should be increased. It was pointed out in the course of a lengthy discussion that the two cases were not exactly similar and that whereas, in the case of the China Consular Establishments, the Government of India’s appeal to the spirit of the Resolution of the 1923 Imperial Economic Conference might be held to be valid, in view of the fact that the principal ground on which the claim to that particular contribution was based, was the extent of India’s trade with China, there existed in the case of Basra considerations apart from the value of Indo-Iraq trade which might legitimately be held to justify a contribution from Indian revenues towards the cost of the post. It was suggested that the Government of India were importing into the Resolution of the Imperial Conference, which had clearly contemplated ’’give and take” arrangements, a significance which it had never been intended to bear, and that His Majesty’s Government had never meant to imply that they would continue to maintain existing Consulates and establish new ones entirely at their own expense, even in those cases where a large part of the Consular work was carried out on behalf of the subjects of the Dominions or of India, as, for example, at Basra, where the number of resident Indians was twice as great as the number of other British subjects and at least a third of the Consul’s time would be taken up with purely Indian matters. It was further suggested that the fact that India paid for, or contributed towards, certain posts (Kashgar, Persia, Tengyueh and the Vice-Consulate at Jeddah) could be justified on the ground that they existed entirely, or almost entirely, in Indian interests. 'But for India, His Majesty’s Government might not consider that other British interests justified the existence of some of these posts, whereas there are probably no Consular posts which it would not be worth while to maintain except for the interests of some one of the Dominions.' 140. The question was accordingly referred back to the Government of India in a telegram dated 9th March, 1935, from which the following is an extract 'l have carefully considered your arguments but am not satisfied that adequate case has been made out for refusal of contribution. I cannot regard argument based on practice in Dominions as necessarily conclusive in all cases, irrespective of their particular merits. I consider that merits in this case differ from those in case of Chinese Consulates where I am prepared to support your view that Indian contribution should cease. Admitted extent of Indian interest at Basra and in Persian Gulf generally, as well as fact that up to 1914 whole cost of Basra Consulate was borne by India, seem to me to justify contribution from Indian revenues towards cost of reviving Consulate. Contribution might conveniently be fixed for the present at moiety of cost on analogy of division of Persian Consular expenditure ' 141. In their reply, the Government of India evaded the principle at issue. 'Wo have reconsidered the question carefully’ they telegraphed 'in the light of your remarks and still feel that it would be unwise to introduce into Iraq moiety system with all its draw-backs in principle and practice and possibilities of indefinite expansion, and should be glad if you could see your way to endorse our offer to provide, possibly at higher cost, our own representative in recognition of our admittedly important commercial interests in Basra'.46 15th July P.2793/29 142. It was pointed out in the India Office that the Government of India’s offer to appoint their own representative at Basra, irrespective of cost, appeared to be based on no principle but that of separatism pure and simple and that it raised serious issues. It was decided, however, to pass it on to the Foreign Office without any expression of the Secretary of State’s views. ’'The Government of India' wrote the India Office 'express a general objection to making contributions in such cases, so long as the Dominion Governments are exempted from bearing any share of the cost of Consular representation. They recognise, however, the extent of Indian interests at Basra, and on this account are prepared, if His Majesty’s Government should so desire^ to appoint their own representative, as at Jeddah, either in the capacity of Vice-Consul or of Agent under Section 7 of the Indian Emigration Act, 1922.' 143. The question remained dormant, however, so far as the India Office were concerned, until 1929, when the Foreign Office informed the India Office that a British Consulate had been re-established at Basra. No mention was made either of the suggested contribution from Indian revenues or of the appointment of a representative by the Government of India.Paragraph 132. F 7282/32 P, 7535/32. P.3233/33 Paragraph 5. Paragraph 120. YUMANFU Al'ID CHUiJGKIIJG 144. After agreeing to waive the contribution of £12,000 from Indian revenues towards the general cost of the China Consular Establishments, the Treasury suggested, in a demi-official letter dated 28th November 1932, that the Government of India might justifiably be asked to share the cost of the post at Yunnanfu and to make an appropriate contribution in respect of the work done in Indian interests at Chungking. They recalled that the Charge d'Affaires at Peking had written in July, 1925, as follovrs:- u It should be remembered that His Majesty’s Consul-General at Yunnanfu acts in the capacity of a liaison officer between the Government of Burma and the Government of Yunnan and it would be hardly an exaggeration to state that approximately half of the duties performed by that officer consists of correspondence with these two administrations, concerning frontier and other matters.” 'With regard to Chengtu, it should be noted that His Majesty’s Consul-General, together with his Vice-Consul, whose duties include an annual visit to Tachienlu on the Tibetan Border, are employed as intelligence officers for the Government of India in all matters appertaining to Tibet'. It was pointed out, however, that the position had been modified since 1925 by the closing down of the Chengtu Consulate and the transference of the work formerly done there on behalf of the Government of India to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Chungking, who had on his staff a Tibetan interpreter at Tachienlu. 145. The Treasury proposals were referred to the Government of India, who were informed that the cost of the Consulate-General at Yunnanfu amounted to approximately £3,200 per annum and that £220 per annum would be considered by the Treasury an appropriate contribution from Indian revenues in respect of Chungking. 146. In their reply, dated 17th May 1933, the Government of India invited attention to their letters of 26th March 1889 and 10th July 1924, regarding the contribution from Indian revenues towards the cost of Consular Establishments in China. 'it does not appear to the Government of India' they wrote 'that the amount of work done by the Consulates- General at Yunnanfu and Chungking on behalf of India and Burma is more than can reasonably be expected from British Consulates elsewhere to which India is not called upon to contribute, and it certainly does not appear that any extra establishment is required for the performance of additional work on behalf of India or Burma. 'Public opinion in this country' they added 'is strongly against India bearing such charges, especially as no Dominion or Colony has been called upon to do so', and they therefore regretted that they were unable to accept the Treasury’s suggestion.F.3654/33 147. The substance of the Government of India’s reply was passed on demi-officially to the Treasury, who replied that although they could not accept the Government of India’s view on the question, they did not feel that any good purpose would be served by pursuing the question further at the moment.49.

In a letter dated 24th March 1936, the Government of India informed the Government of Burma that in their opinion the payment of approximately £2,488 hitherto made annually from Indian revenues in respect of consular * expenditure in Yunnan and Siam should, after Separation, be debited to the revenues of Burma. Before accepting the liability for this annual payment, however, the Government of Burma enquired through correspondence with the British Legation at Bangkok and the British Consulate at Tengyueh, whether any grounds existed for dividing the contribution in future between the revenues of India and the revenues of Burma. 149. In a letter to the British Minister at Bangkok dated 27th January 1937, the Government of Burma pointed out that in recent consular reports mention had been made of the considerable number of Indian traders in parts of Siam and enquired whether the work done at the Chiengmai and Nakawn Lampang consulates on behalf of natives of India, as distinct from Burmese, could be held to justify a division of the contribution in respect of these posts between the Government of India and the Government of Burma. 150. In his reply, dated 9th March 1937, Sir J. Crosby enclosed a memorandum by Mr. Coultas, His Majesty’s Consul at Chiengmai, who is also Superintending Officer for the Consulate at Nakawn Lampong, regarding the volume of work performed at those two establishments in respect of Indian and Burmese British subjects respectively. M Since the reason given for the proposed transfer is that the services rendered by the consulates to British Indian subjects, as distinct from Burmans, will not differ in nature or extent from those provided for British subjects by non-subsidized consulates,’' wrote Mr. Coultas ”it is to be inferred that the subsidy was originally granted (l) because of special services rendered and (2) because the demand for such services came almost exclusively from British subjects of Burman (including Shan) origin. 'The special services referred to include:- (a) Duties of consular officers in connection with the working of the international court system which demanded frequent attendance in the Siamese courts: (b) Exercise of Consular Probate Jurisdiction: (c) Investigation of complaints against local Siamese administration: (d) Touring the district for purposesconnected with (c), necessitating the maintenance of elephant and pony transport: (e) General political supervision. 'Although, numerically, British subjects of Burmese and cognate races seem always to have exceeded those of Indian50 race, it cannot be said that the nature of the consular services rendered differs in any important degree as between representatives of each category. Moreover, although the special services enumerated above have been partially discontinued, consular duties in Northern Siam retain an almost exclusively political character. At the same time the composition of the British subject population remains overwhelmingly Indian and Burmese (Shan). In the circumstances there would seem to be a justification for the division of the subsidy between India and Burma in the numerical ratio of the resident population It is suggested that an equitable division of the subsidy as between the Governments of India and Burma might be assessed for the present in the proportion of 1 to 7. 1 ’ 151. Sir Josiah Crosby, however* suggested that the simplest plan would be for the Government of Burma to become responsible for the subsidy in its entirety. He added, moreover, that the number of European British subjects in the north of Siam was negligible. Mr. Coultas had estimated the number of natives of Burma residing in the Chiengmai consular district on the 1st March 1936, at 16,899. 152. Sir Josiah Crosby also forwarded to the Government of Burma a copy of a despatch from the British Consul-General at Bangkok and of a Memorandum by the acting British Consul at Songkhla, regarding the character of the consular work performed at those posts. With regard to Bangkok, Mr. Bailey drew attention to the very large number of Indians resident in his consular district, whom he estimated at not less than 100,000 and possibly as many as 200,000, and to the comparatively small number of Burmans and Shans. M I should say” he wrote ’’that Indian business takes up one-sixth of office time. I am of the opinion that there is no case for a payment of a subsidy from Burma for Bangkok; I think that the best measure of assistance that India could give, especially in its own interests, would be the appointment of an Indian agent to be attached to His Majesty’s Consulate-General who could visit the Provinces from time to time.' Sir Josiah Crosby, however, did not endorse Mr. Bailey’s recommendation. 153. In the case of Songkhla, Mr. Whittington stated that while the work performed on behalf of Burmese was negligible, British Indians numbered 75$ of the British population of his consular district and accounted for certainly not less than one half of the official business which he transacted. The special work performed in the consulate for British subjects he described as follows:- (1) The protection of the legal rights of British subjects in accordance with treaty provisions including:- (a) the scrutiny of certain cases brought before the Siamese courts, and (b) the registration, at the consulate, of British subjects. He added that as a result of treaty revision this work would probably largely disappear in the near future. (2) The investigation of petitions, both those arising out of (1) above, end those concerned with complaints against Siamese officials or private persons.51. (3) The provision of travel facilities by the issue of passports and emergency certificates. It was estimated that the latter service, performed for the most part on behalf of the many Indian traders resident in South Siam who travel frequently between Siam and Malaya, consumed two-thirds of the time and energy of the consular staff. 154. Other general consular functions such as the protection of trading interests and the performance of notarial duties, performed on behalf of British Indian subjects, accounted for not a little work. 155. In view of the information supplied by Mr. Whittington, Sir Josiah Crosby concluded that while a contribution from the Government of Burma towards the expenses of the Songkhla consulate was not called for, there seemed to be a good case for a grant of a subsidy by the Government of India. 156. Meanwhile a similar enquiry had been addressed by the Government of Burma to the British Consul at Tengyueh, regarding the character of the consular work performed there, and they had been informed in reply that no work was performed in the consulate on behalf of Indians, as distinct from Burmans, which differed to any extent from work performed in unsubsidized consulates. 157. In view of the information supplied from Bangkok and Tengyueh, therefore, the Government of Burma agreed to accept, with effect from the date of separation, the liability for the annual contribution formerly made from Indian revenues towards the cost of the consular posts at Chiengmai, Nakawn Lampang and Tengyueh. R.M.J.H. Burma Office. October, 1938.52 APPENDIX I . EXTRACTS FROM THE FINAL REPORT OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE EXPENDITURE OF INDIA, 1900. CHAPTER III . I. APPORTIONMENT OF EXPENDITURE BETWEEN (page 90. ) THE UNITED KINGDOM AND INDIA. x Para. 231. We proceed to discuss, in the third place, that branch of our reference which directs us to inquire into the apportionment of charge between the Governments of the United Kingdom and India for purposes in which both are interested. We are somewhat embarrassed as to the meaning of the phrase. The United Kingdom is, in one sense, interested in the whole Government of India, and it may be said that India is interested in the Government of the United Kingdom, but this can scarcely be the meaning of the reference. SETTLEMENTS, MISSIONS, CONSULAR AGENCIES, &amp;c . (page 91.) Para. 235. The class of charges which come next most obviously within the terms of the reference, comprises the contributions to missions and consular agencies, the administration of settlements (such as Aden), and subsidies for lines of communication in which both the United Kingdom and India are interested. The countries in which the diplomatic and administrative charges arise, extend from Arabia to China, and there is no doubt of the interest of India in many questions of policy connected with them; but it must be admitted that the imposition upon India of contributions towards the cost of these services connected with these places, has no parallel in our relations with other Colonies and dependencies. Canada is extremely interested in our diplomatic relations with the United States, very many, and probably the most important of the questions arising between us and the States, having their origin in Canada; but no contribution has over been made by Canada towards the cost of the Embassy at Washington. Historical circumstances explain the origin of the present arrangement. When the East India Company was a semi-independent power with a monopoly of oriental trade, it had its diplomatic agents in the East, just as it had an army and a navy, ond in later times sufficient justification for some apportionment of the charge has been found in the direct Marginal references in this Appendix ore to Paragraphs and Pages of the Final Report of the Yfelby Commission (Cmd. 131 of 1900).53 interest Indi^ has in the development of commerce in the East and in the maintenance of uninterrupted waterways. We recognise the defensibility of the principle of apportionment, but the rate of apportionment requires constant revision, first in the light of the proportion which home trade with the Far East bears to Indian trade with the same; and next in consideration of the growing interest of Australian Colonies in the maintenance of the Red Sea route. THE PERSIAN luISSION . (pages 92-3^ Para. 242. The Persian Mission was established in 1810, and was maintained at the charge of Great Britain until 1823, when it was transferred to India. From 1823 to 1831 it was wholly supported from Indian funds. In 1835 it was re-transferred to the British Foreign Office, the Indian Government contributing £12,000 a year towards its cost. In 1859 another change was made, and the Mission and the Consulates at Tehran, Tabriz, and Resht, were placed under the Government of India. The cost of the Mission was then estimated at £15,000 a year, towards which Great Britain paid £3,000, and £2,000 on account of the Consulates. In 1860 the Mission and the Consulates were re transferred to the British Foreign Office, and from 1860-1 to 1879-80 India contributed £12,000 towards the Mission, leaving the Consulates at the sole charge of Great Britain. In 1880, on the recommendation of the Select Committee which inquired, in 1871, into Diplomatic and Consular Establishments, the Indian contribution to the Mission was reduced to £10,000, and that rate was paid till 1890-1. In 1891 it was decided at the Foreign Office Conference, which, under the presidency of Lord Salisbury, examined various questions at issue between the two Governments, to reduce the contribution to £7,000. The Treasury consider that contribution too small, and the Indian Government consider it too great. The Treasury has made a calculation of the charges incurred by India c.nd Great Britain respectively for the Mission and the Consulates in Persia, including the telegraphic establishments, but exclusive of the subsidies to steam service on the Tigris and Korun. They estimate the Indian charge in 1891 at £24,600 and the British charge at £16,400. Sir H. Waterfield states the average expenditure of India on the Persian Mission and Consulates during the three years 1893—4, 1894-5, 1895-6, at £30,522; of Great Britain, at £21,824. The two Governments are not agreed as to the extent of their respective interests in Persia. It is, in our opinion, desirable to adopt a general principle of division which will put an end to these discussions. Both countries have admittedly a large interest in Persia, and we think that the charges of the Mission and Consulates should be evenly divided between the two countries. We think, also, that the British Foreign Office should not create or add to the establishments and services under its control without the consent of the Government of India, and vice versa, that the Government of India should not add to the establishments and services under their control without the consent of the Foreign Office. Lastly, the charge as made up for division should bo complete, including outfits, pensions, and all contingoncios, to which the Government of India sometimes demurs.THE CHINA CONSULAR ESTABLISHMENTS. (page 93.) The East India Company bore the -whole expense of diplomatic and consular intercourse with China as long as it enjoyed a monopoly of British trade with China. In 1834 that monopoly ceased, and it was decided that Great Britain should thence forth pay two-thirds and India one-third of the cost of the superintendents of trade, who were to represent diplomatic and consular interests in China. India paid in consequence one-third of the charge from 1834 to 1875, subject to some deductions 0 The opening up of China and increase of trade led to an increase of the diplomatic and consular establishments, and., apparently* one-third of the divisible charges would now amount to about £20,000 a year. In 1876 the arrangement was revised, and from that year to 1889 India paid a fixed contribution of £15,000 a year. The Indian Government, however, considered this contribution excessive, and they desired to reduce it to £10,000. The Treasury maintained, on the other hand, that £15,000 was a fair contribution. The question was referred to the 'Foreign Office Conference' in 1891* and the Conference split the difference, reducing the contribution to £12,500, a rate which was to continue in force until 1899-1900. Thus the interest of India in the China trade has always been officially acknowledged, and it must be borne in mind that India depends for a considerable proportion of her revenue on the opium trade with China. She has so far a special concern in efficient representation at the ports in China where opium is imported. It is impossible to apportion such interests between Great Britain and India with mathematical accuracy. We think that the decision of the Foreign Office Conference should be maintained, that the contribution should be fixed for a certain period, say, ten years. If the conditions of trade should in the meantime change, and if there should arise in consequence a difference of opinion between the two Governments, the point, when the date of revision arrives, should be submitted to the arbitration which we suggest in another section of our report. The present arrangement might be allowed to remain in force for a period of five or six years. THE JEDDAH CONS ULATE. (page 95.) The Indian Government agreed, in consideration of the number of Indian pilgrims passing through Jeddah to Mecca, to pay half the charge of the Consulate at Jeddah. The contribution varies from about £400 to £700 a year, and no question arises upon it. We may observe that India does not actually pay half the charge, as she declines to include in the account various consular charges, such as travelling, leave, and outfit allowance s. THE CHIENGMAI CONSULA TE. (page 95.) The consulate was created in 1883 for the protection of British Indians in Northern Siam. It used to be wholly maintained from Indian Funds. It was transferred, in 1891, for convenience sake, to the British Consular estimates, on condition that India should bear the cost. It appears, however, that in actual fact she does not bear the whole cost. No question is raised by India upon this charge.lonopoly whence- \ III. APPORTIONMENT OF CHARGE.

China Diplomatic and Consular Establishments . - We have recommended that the decision of the Foreign Office Conference in 1891, fixing the contribution of India to this service at £12,500, should be upheld; that the amount of the contribution should be fixed for periods of (say) 10 years; that if, when the time of revision arrives, there should be a difference of opinion between the two Governments as to the amount, the point should be submitted for the arbitration suggested in paragraph 317; and that the present arrangement should remain in force for a period of five or six years.

By Sir James Poile, K.C.S.I. (page 144.) China Consular Establishments. India pays £12,500. No change recommended. I did not dissent from this conclusion. But this payment is really a relic of a long extinct trade monopoly, and I think that the British Government might very well resign it.56. 3. By Sir Andrew Scoble, K. C.S.I., Q«C., M.P .j and Sir Robert Mo wbra y^ Bart. 3 M.P . (page 1^6^ We have signed this Report, subject to the following reservations. 2. The occasion for the separate representation of the interest of the East India Company in Asiatic diplomacy having ceased on the transfer of the Government of India to the Crown, we can see no reason why India ;hould any longer be called upon to pay any contribution to the cost of our diplomatic and consular establishments in the East. We think the conduct of the external foreign affairs of India should be transferred to the management and charge of the British Foreign Office; while the internal foreign affairs of India (including Afghanistan) may fairly be left to the management and charge of the Government of India. 4. By Mr. T.Ro Buchanan, M.P. (p&amp;g© 147•) The principal payments made by India to the Imperial Exchequer may be thus classified I. Diplomatic and consular charges, chiefly in Persia and China, amounting to upwards of £43,000 per annum. There is one common feature in these charges. They are payments paid from time to time for a short term of years after long negotiation and correspondence between the two Governments. When the term expires the same negotiations and discussions are resumed. The last word in all cases is and must be with the Home Government. India always protests, and there are few of these charges in the justice of which she has acquiesced. These irritating negotiations, which Lord Salisbury has described as ’’squalid” and Lord Northbrook as a ’’scandal”, are an unmixed evil. And it will be a great gain, political as well as financial, if some of these charges, and the most contentious of then, can be done away with altogether, and others placed on a more stable foundation. (page 148.) It may be laid down as a cardinal principle that within her own borders India shall pay her own way, and that she shall provide not merely for her own internal government and protection, but generally for her defence against external as well as internal foes. No grant-in-aid from Imperial funds should be made to the Indian Government for Indian purposes within India itself except on very rare occasions and under very exceptional circumstances. 7fere such a practice to arise, it would seriously lessen the financial responsibility and administrative independence of the Government of India. On the other hand, payments made by the Indian to the British Exchequer should also be exceptional, and in each case need special justification. The test of their fairness or unfairness may be taken to be whether they are or are not payments for Indian services or purposes in India. Of course there are paymen-cs, such as the purchase of railway and other stores by the Indian Government in this country, about which there is no question. It is the four main branches of payment noted above that demand attention.57, I, Diplomatic and Consular Charges. - Applying the above test, it is clear that India should be relieved of all charges for Missions and Consulates in Persia, China, and other places. Elsewhere throughout the British Empire these duties are Imperial duties, and their expenses defrayed from Imperial funds. No valid reason can be adduced for placing an exceptional burden in this respect on India. REPORT BY SIR W. WEDDERBURN, Bt., M.P., Mr. W.S. CAINE and Ifc. S.' TOffOTT With reference to minor expenses, such as Aden, (page 188.) diplomatic and consular establishments, subsidies, etc., east of the Red Sea, we are willing to accept the view taken by our colleagues. But we think that in all cases where British colonies and dependencies in Australia and the Far East are also interested, they should be required to pay their share. The self-governing colonies have recently shown a strong desire to identify themselves with Imperial interest, and even to share in the burdens; and we are of opinion that if, under these circumstances, they are unwilling to contribute to the charges now in question, and if the Imperial Government is not prepared to insist upon its claim, it would be unbecoming to make an exception in the case of India, and to exact from her a contribution in disregard of her protest.58 APPENDIX II. CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA IN COUNCIL AND THE TREASURY ON THE SUBJECT OF THE REPORT OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON INDIAN EXPENDITURE, 1900, No, 1. India Office to Treasury, F.3418, 17th July, 1900, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to draw the attention of the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury to the proposals of the Royal Commission on Indian Expenditure, regarding the apportionment of charge between the Governments of the United Kingdom and of India for purposes in which both are interested. According to paragraph 364 of the Report of the Commission, the total amount of the annual charges to be transferred from the revenues of India to those of the United Kingdom would be approximately £293,000; but this includes a sum of £108,000 sterling as one half of the military charges for Aden, which should have been stated as 108,000 tens of rupees, so that a reduction of £36,000 must be made. The total amount of relief which India would receive, if all the recommendations of the Commission were adopted, would therefore be, not £293,000, but £257,000 a year. I am desired to express Lord George Hamilton’s confident hope that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury will accept the unanimous opinion of the Commission, in so far as it is in favour of relieving the revenues of India to that extent. As regards the heads under which the relief should be given, I am directed to make the following suggestions. It appears to Lord George Hamilton that this opportunity might with advantage be taken to put an end to certain minor payments that are now made by India, and thus to simplify the accounts between the two Governments. At present the Secretary of State in Council pays £7,000 a year on account of the Mission to the Court of Persia, £12,500 a year for Her Majesty’s Establishments in China, and £1,787 as contributions towards the expenses of the Jeddah, Momein, and Busreh Consulates, making a total of £21,287 for political charges. He also pays a subsidy of £10,000 a year to the Eastern Telegraph Company on account of the Zanzibar-Mauritius cable• I am to suggest that for the future all these contri butions might be foregone by the Imperial Government. His Lordship assumes that £130,000 will be allowed as half the cost of the transport of troops to and from India,and will be defrayed by the Imperial Government, in accordance with the proposals of the Commission. With respect to the Military Charges for Aden, Lord George Hamilton desires me to suggest that the sum to be granted from Imperial revenues might equitably be fixed at £100,000 a year, being slightly in excess of the share which the Commissioners considered that the Imperial Govern ment should bear, but on the other hand, somewhat less than the sum (£108,000) by which they apparently intended that India should benefit under this head. If these suggestions are accepted by the Lords Commissioners, the total amount of relief to be received by £ ♦Political charges 21,287 Telegraph subsidy 10,000 Transport, moiety 130,000 Share of Aden expenses 100,000 £261,287 India will be £261,287* a year, and Lord George Hamilton is prepared to accept that sum as satisfying the equitable claims of India under existing circumstances in respect of the subjects referred to the Royal Commission.

The Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury have carefully considered, in communication with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for War, your letter of the 17th July, 1900, relative to the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Indian Expenditure in favour of the transfer of certain annual charges from the revenues of India to those of the United Kingdom; and I am directed to request that you will submit to the Secretary of State for India in Council the following reply.61. 2^r After the necessary correction of the figure given by the Royal Commission for half the military charges for Aden, their recommendations are that the following grants be made by the Imperial Government to India:- The modification of these proposals suggested in your letter under reply consists in the substitution, for the direct contribution in aid of the charge for the India Office, and for the £5,000 increase of contribution to the Persian Mission, of the following:- military charges for Aden (making the the total £100,000) The waiver by the Imperial Government of certain minor payments nov/ made annually by India 1. Subsidy to the Eastern Telegraph Company on account of the Zanzibar-Mauritius Cable 10,000 2, Persian Mission 7,000 3. Establishments in China 12,500 4, Consulates at Jeddah, Momein, and Basra 1,787 This sum, together with £72,000 representing half the military charges for Aden and £130,000 representing half the cost of transport of troops, makes up a total of £261,287, as compared with the £257,000 recommended by the Royal Commission, beyond which my Lords are not prepared to increase materially the contribution from Imperial Funds. Secretary of State for War informs my Lords that he is prepared to make an annual contribution from Army Funds, towards the cost of the transport of troops and towards the military charges for Aden, of £230,000, to commence as from 1st April, 1901, His lordship, however, points out that the Royal Commission recommended that the capitation rate, which forms the basis of the contribution paid by India for Home Effective Charges, should be revised in five or six years, and he proposes therefore that the contribution of £230,000 should remain in force for a similar period. My Lords concur in this proposal. There remains to be considered the suggestion that the Imperial Government should forego the payments now made by India to the extent of £31,287 per annum, as set out above. In aid of the charge for the India Office Half the military charges for Aden Increased contribution to the charge of the Persian Mission Half the cost of the transport of troops to and from India £ 50.000 72.000 5,000 130,000 Total 257,000 Additional grant in respect of the £ &amp; 28,000 31,287 59,287 With reference to the above proposals, theMy Lords fully share the opinion of the Secretary of State in Council that it is desirable to take the opportunity of putting an end to these payments, so far as circumstances justify, with a view to simplifying to that extent the accounts between the two Governments; and, for their part, they readily agree to give up the Indian contribution of £10,000 per annum towards the subsidy for the Zanzibar-Mauritius cable* As regards the other payments by India which are now appropriated in aid of the Diplomatic and Consular Vote, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has expressed his views in a letter dated the 11th ultimo, of which I am to enclose a copy. It will be seen that the Marquess prepared to forego the following sums:- For establishments in China For the Persian Mission (the sum recommended by the Royal Commission) 17,500 of Salisbury is £ 12,500 5,000 £2,000 per annum would thus continue to be payable by India in respect of the Persian Mission. The Foreign Office letter points out that £1,787 does not correctly represent the existing contributions for Jeddah, Momein, and Basra Consulates, which should be £2,664 per annum, and suggests that India should continue to pay a lump sum of £6,000 (to include the remaining £2,000 in respect of the Persian Mission, and the present contributions (a) for the Consulates at Jeddah, Momein, and Basra, and (b) for the Consulates at Kerman and Chiengmai). My Lords concur in this suggestion, which would have the result of making the total concession to India about £500 more than the £257,000 per annum recommended by the Royal Commission. My Lords trust that the Secretary of State in Council will be able to accept the above proposals as satis fying the equitable claims of India, under existing circum stances, in respect of the subjects referred to the Royal Commission* I am, &amp;c. (Signed) E.W. Hamilton. Enclosure in No. 5* Foreign Office to Treasury. 11th August, 1900. The Marquess of Salisbury has given careful consider ation to your letter of the 26th ultimo, and to the proposals of the Secretary of State for India with regard to the with drawal of certain contributions hitherto made from Indian funds towards Her Majesty*s Diplomatic and Consular Establish ments in China, Persia, and Turkey.63. I am directed by his Lordship to state that, in view of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Indian Expenditure, he is prepared to accept the arrangement as modified by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, viz*, that the contribution of £12,500 towards the establishments in China should no longer appear as an appropriation-in-aid of the Diplomatic and Consular Vote, and that the £7,000 now furnished by India towards Imperial expenditure in Persia should be reduced by £5,000. Yfith regard to the payments for the maintenance of Her Majesty*s Consulates at Jeddah, Momein, and Basra, I am to observe that the sum of £1,787 does not correctly represent the amounts supplied by India for that purpose. The figures appear to have been taken from the Appropriation Account for 1898-99, which, amongst other things, only included a half-year*s contribution in the case of Basra. The items now stand as follows:- £ For Jeddah 790 n Momein 474 (maximum) Basra *•• •.. ... 1,400 £2,664 I am also to point out that contributions have hitherto been received from India towards the expenses of two other consulates, viz:- £ For Kerman ... ... ••• 400 (maximum) ” Chiengmai 1,000 1,400 Lord Salisbury entirely concurs in Lord George Hamilton’s view that it is very desirable to put an end to the minor payments which are now made by India, and thus to simplify the accounts between the two Governments, and he gathers from the expressions contained in your letter that the Lords of the Treasury are of the same opinion. The periodical revision of these assessments gives rise to some inconvenience, and to much lengthy correspondence. If the Secretary of State is asked to forego so large a sum as £17,500 for the benefit of the Indian Exchequer, there seems to be no sufficient reason for disputing the exact figures at which the half share to be borne by India on account of each individual consulate should from time to time be fixed. More over, these special payments are apt to attract attention, and to give rise to adverse comment and criticism, relating as they do to places affected by so many diverse political considerations, and situated so far apart on the Red Sea and the Shatt-el-Arab and in remote provinces of Persia, China and Siam. It appears to his Lordship that the desired simpli fication of accounts can best be effected by merging the smaller payments in one general contribution, which, however much reduced, might still be regarded as a share of the Imperial expenditure in China, Persia, and Siam. I am therefore to suggest, for their Lordships* ‘ con sideration, that the Government of India should for the future64 contribute £6,000 per annum to the Diplomatic and Consular Vote, this sum being, arrived at approximately as follows £ Remnant of general contribution for Persia £ 2,000 Existing contributions for Jeddah 790 n n M Home in 474 ' « 11 Basra 1,400 2,664 11 M Kerman 400 ” M Chiengmai 1,000 1,400 £6,064 The total amount at present paid from Indian revenues is £23,564, and the saving to India by reducing this sum to £6,000 is £17,564, as compared with £17,500, the figure mentioned in your letter* I am, «Scc* (Signed) T*H.

A discussion on some aspects of these questions took place during the preliminary consideration of the work lying before the Conference at the Second Meeting, held on the 4th October, 1923. CO-OPERATION IN RESPECT OF COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE . With regard to commercial intelligence, the Conference had before them a memorandum on Co-operation between Home and Dominion Governments in respect of Commercial Intelligence I.E.C. (23)-5 3€ . The Chairman pointed out that the Imperial War Conference in 1917 recommended that the services of His Majesty’s Trade Commissioners should be placed at the disposal of the Governments of the Dominions and India. There had now been established a commercial diplomatic service in foreign countries, and attention had been paid -to the development of the commercial side of the work of the Consular Service. It was now proposed that the services of commercial diplomatic officers, and of senior consular officers in certain countries where no commercial diplomatic officer is stationed, should be made available to the Governments of the Dominions and India in the same way and to the same extent as the services of the Trade Commissioners had already been made available. The principle His Majesty’s Government had in mind was the principle of mutuality, and they hoped that the services of commercial representatives of the Dominions might in the same way be made available to British traders in areas where there was no commercial representative of the United Kingdom. x Printed below. CONFIDENTIAL. I.E.C. (23)-5 miORANDUM CONCERNING CO-OPERATION BETWEEN HOME AND DOMINION GOVERNMENTS IN RESPECT OF COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. In connection with the general question of closer co-operation between the various countries within the British Empire, consideration has been given to the possibility of extending the facilities for the supply of commercial inform ation required by the Governments of the Dominions and of India. The Commercial Intelligence Services overseas maintained by His Majesty’s Government are the Trade Commissioner Service withinthe Empire and the Consular and Commercial Diplomatic Services in foreign countries. The Trade Commissioner Service . Occasion was taken at the Imperial War Conference of 1917 to call the attention of the representatives of the Dominions and India to the measures which were being adopted at that time to extend and strengthen the Trade Commissioner Service. As a result of a resolution passed by that Conference, the Governments of the Dominions and of India were invited to utilise the services of His Majesty's Trade Commissioners should they desire to do so. The duties of Trade Commissioners in the matter of co-operation with the Governments who utilise their services have been laid down as follows (a) To reply to commercial enquiries which may be addressed to them by traders or by the Governments represented, and to suggest suitable local agents for producers or manufacturers in the part of the British Empire represented. (b) To notify the Government represented of changes in the Customs Tariffs or other regulations affecting its trade. (c) To report ary openings for trade or contracts open to tender which might interest producers or manufacturers in the part of the British Empire represented. (d) To circulate or distribute in the area in which they are stationed, official literature relating to the trade, agriculture, and manufacture of the part of the British Empire represented, and (e) Generally to watch over the trade interests of the part of the British Empire represented in the area in which they are stationed. The Consular Service . As the result of an arrangement made in 191^ with the Government of Canada and subsequently extended to the other Dominions, Dominion firms are at liberty to apply direct to any of His Majesty's Consuls for information as to the possibilities of sale of Dominion products, the method under which business is conducted and the best means of getting into touch with markets. Under the terms of the agreement. Dominion Trade Commissioners are also at liberty to apply to His Majesty's Consuls for advice and assistance. The agreement did not, however, provide for Governors-General, Dominion Government Departments, or High Commissioners, communicating direct with Consular Officers. On one or two occasions when this point has been raised by a Dominion Government or a High Commissioner, attention has been called to the inconvenience which would be caused by direct application from Dominion Governments or their official representatives in the United Kingdom addressed to Consular Officers for information on commercial and similar questions.It has been pointed out that: (a) The desired information can in many cases be supplied by the Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade (which Branch is now merged in the Department of Overseas Trade) or by the Diplomatic Missions abroad, thus avoiding unnecessary demands on the time of the Consular Officers, and (b) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should, as far as possible, be in a position to know the . amount of work which is being placed on individual Consular Officers. It has, however, been made clear that no objection is seen to direct communication between a Dominion Government and Consular Officers outside Europe taking place on exceptional occasions when time was of importance and where a distinct saving of time would result from direct communication, though it has been requested that all communications with Consular Officers in Europe should as hitherto be carried on through the Secretary of State for the Colonies. In cases where it is merely a question of obtaining commercial information there is of course no objection to a High Commissioner bringing the matter directly to the attention of the Department of Overseas Trade. Commercial Diplomatic Service . The question of the Governments o£ ^he Dominions and India making use of the services of commercial diplomatic officers by means of direct correspondence was not raised, as in the case of the Trade Commissioner Service, during the Conference of 1917, very largely because it was considered premature to do so whilst the Service was undergoing a process of complete reorganisation, and whilst it was not yet possible to gauge with any accuracy the amount of work which would be thrown upon the newly appointed officers. The reorganisation of the Service has, however, new- been completed and in 1921-2 arrangements were made with the Government of Canada and later suggested to the other Dominion Governments under which Dominion firms and Trade Commissioners would be able to apply to Commercial Diplomatic Officers for similar assistance to that which they receive from Consular Officers. It is still considered desirable that enquiries which the Governments of the Dominions and India or their official representatives in the United Kingdom wish to address to ccaumercial diplomatic officers stationed in Europe should, in the first instance, be transmitted through the regular channels to the Department of Overseas Trade. Little or no delay will result from the maintenance of this procedure, and in many cases the supply of information required will, in fact, be expedited owing to the information already being within the possession of the Department. If, however, the Governments of the Dominions and of India think it would be of advantage to them. His Ma je sty * s Government will be glad to make arrangements under which the services of commercial diplomatic officers outside Europe can be utilised by them in the same way and to the same extent as the services of His Majesty's Trade Commissioners are at their69. * disposal. Similar arrangements could also be made in respect of Senior Consular Officers in extra-European countries where there are no commercial diplomatic officers if this is desired. RESOLUTION 4 (A) (1) OF THE CONFERENCE . 4. FURTHER STEPS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF MUTUAL TRADE. (A) Imperial Co-operation in respect of Commercial Intelligence. It was decided to adopt the following Resolutions: (i) Comraercial Diplomatic and Consular Services. 'This Imperial Economic Conference takes note of the offer of His Majesty’s Government to place the services of His Majesty's Commercial Diplomatic Officers in foreign countries at the disposal of the Governments of the Dominions and India and of the Colonies and Protectorates in the same way and to the same extent as the services of His Majesty's Trade Commissioners within the Empire are already at their disposal. It notes that His Majesty’s Government propose that as regards countries outside of Europe the Governments should utilise direct the services of Commercial Diplomatic Officers or of senior Consular Officers where no Commercial Diplomatic Officers have been appointed, but that no communications which it is proposed to address to Commercial Diplomatic Officers in European countries should be trans mitted in the first instance to the Department of Overseas Trade. 'The Conference, recognising the importance of all possible steps being taken to strengthen the mutual co operation of the several parts of the Empire in matters of commercial intelligence with a view to the development of Empire trade, welcomes the arrangements proposed by His Ma j e sty * 1 s Gove rnme nt. 'It also welcomes the offer of the Governments of the Dominions which had appointed Trade Commissioners in countries overseas to make a similar arrangement for the utilisation of those officers by Governments of other parts of the Empire.
