Anderson writes that the Government has approved of Kemball’s proceedings. Enclosed with Anderson's letter are two further pieces of correspondence:1. A copy of memorandum no.1444 of 1855 (folio 289), signed by Anderson, dated 9 April 1855. The memorandum relates to naval resources in the Persian Gulf for the suppression of the slave trade. Anderson writes that Sir Henry Leeke, Commodore and Commander in Chief of the Indian Navy, suggests that three small sailing vessels and one steamer would be required to suppress the trade in the Persian Gulf, and three small sailing vessels and two steamers at the Aden station. To completely prevent the trade outright, Leeke suggests that eight sailing vessels and four steamers would be required.2. Letter no.295 of 1855 (folio 290) from Leeke, dated 11 April 1855. Leeke’s letter states that, at the present time, the Indian Navy does not have any vessels available for despatch to either the Persian Gulf or Red Sea, to assist in the suppression of the slave trade.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x00004a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
