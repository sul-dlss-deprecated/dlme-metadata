In obedience to your noble order and in the service of the public interest I have formed the present cabinet. It was known that the task of this cabinet is confined to the dissolution of the chamber of deputies and to the holding of new elections in accordance with the pirovisions of the new electoral law. The cabinet has carried out its task relying on God and the assistance of Your Royal Highness. General elections were completed and the results have shown that the overwhelming majority of the pupulation supports the independents who constitute the majotrity in the new chamber of deputies. As the Electoral Law has been applied for the first time certain objections have been lodged against certain electoral prosecutions and it was natural to refer these objections to the authorities concerned appointed by the law; these are the inspec tion committees, judges and presidents of the courts of appeal. The judges and the presidents of the courts of appeal have submi tted thefr reports which corroborate that the elections have been carrid out in accordance with the provisions of law.fclJUMW F 212 As the task of the cabinet came to an end by the completion of the elections, I submit my resignation to my Lord His Royal Highness the Exalted Regent in order to give way to the formation of a cabinet supported by the majority of the chamber of deputies. I hereby take this opportunity to express to my Lord my extreme thankfulness and the thankfulness of my colleagues for the noble assistance and sympathy extended to us while carrying out our duties, asking His Highness to accept our respect and praise. NHRI AS SATD, Dear Nuri as Sa’id, I received your letter of resignation of 11 March 1947, and while expressing my deep regret for your relinquishment of the post of Prime Minister, I have to express to you my extreme appreciation to you and your colleagues for the valuable efforts you exerted for the well-being of the country. It is to be known that your resignation shall not affect your esteemed position and that the country will not be deprived of the benefit of your aptitu le and the results of your experiences in the various circumstances and conditions.
