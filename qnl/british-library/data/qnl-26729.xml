You mentioned in your letter of February 6th the decision of Klfl£ Ibn Sauci that no Kuelim from the Iiidian .rmy should be included in the Military Mission which is in^ to lauai Arabia. This passed compleltly unnoticed here so rar a» I can ascertain. I do not think thal Ibn laui intended to make &amp; gesture of defiance to the Interim Government; but rather that he has always been proud of his association with Britain and is not prepared to see that watered down by the inclusion of representatives from a country for which he hcs little regard. His knowledge of Indians must be mainly confined to the traders in the Persian Gulf ana the pilgrims to Mecca# and it is perhaps not unnatural that his reaction to the proposal should have been what it was.so as to seal it and cover the old address (or address panel) and posr mans.

British Military Mission to Saudi Arabia . With reference to Sir W. Crofts note of 14th October, it is correct that about two years ago, Ibn Saud asked us to send a Military Mission of Sunni-Moslems Arabia. The Government of India were prepared 'aeoap favourable but the proposal fell through owing to complications with the Americans. When the matter was taken up again recently the Foreign Office, after being consulted, stated in their letter of 1?th September that they did not think thegp could sufficiently strong case to justify our asking the Government of India to supply Sunni-Moslem Indian officers from the Indian Army. As a result of General Dempsey*s recommendations, however, they have now changed their view in Sir Orme Sargent's letter of 10th October. /k- Wfi’ ^ ^ (lc*r is 17 ** 'y I Dtr, ) , A draft telegram to the Government of India is now submitted.about Sunni Moslems for the British Military liission in Saudi Arabia. I am not sure if this is your affair or Military; if the latter, mil you please pass it on? When in Cairo I used to be strongly in favour of introducing Indian Moslems into Saudi Arabia, and deprecated what appeared to be timidity on the part of the Foreign Office. I think this was chiefly in connection with a Financial Adviser. The Government of India had an excellent Moslem whan they were prepared to make available, but the Foreign Office seemed to be afraid of annoying the Americans by playing one of our strong cards, which consists of the fact that we can produce Moslems when the Americans can’t. The Foreign Office seem now to have changed their minds on this subject, as regards the Military Mission, but I don’t know how the matter is looked at from our point of view. 14.10.A6 5 OCT 1946 )*171 ) u I r Foreign Office, S.W.l. loth October, ■ 10116 / 222 / 25 .) 4fi bee^ &amp; ./ill you please refer to General augden's letter to General layne of the 1st October on the subject of the inclusion of a small Sunni Moslem contingent in the British Military Mission to Saudi ^rabia. \'1e had previously informed the India Office (Baxter’s letter to Donaldson of 17 th September, under reference G 8895/222/25) that we did not propose to asx you to pursue the matter with the Government of India. In view however of the strong recommendation now made by General Dempsey, we wish to revise our altitude on the subject. It is clear from General Dempsey’s report that the inclusion of a small Moslem contingent in the Mission would be of the greatest assistance to the Mission in the fulfilment of its duties. -• ot only would it help the Mission to maintain a quick ana easy liaison with the Saudi military authorities, who may be expected to spend much time in Mecca, where non-Moslems may not go, but it would also clearly be desirable that the Gaudis should have an opportunit, of seeing the type of Moslem officer wiiich Bri cish training has proaucea in India. /e believe moreover that the inclusion of such a contingent from the Indian Ariny would redound to the advantage of India, for it should help to enhance the reputation of the Indian Army, and therefore of India itself, in a country vhich must always be of importance to India so long as Indian Moslems in their thousands make the pilgrimage to Mecca. /./e Sir Y/illiam Groft, K.3.G., C.I.B.,**•*'- ^ $ i ^ 3S55V • A t &gt;- , ^ «&gt; ;/e wish therefore to support General Sugden’s request that yon should approach the Government of India and press them to furnish a argali- aunni ^csler contingent for the fission. 1 am sending a copy of this letter to General Gugden•On.fro*: Colonel J.L.

Please refer to correspondence ending witji Calthorpe's letter Wi/lQ95/lAiD 4 of 19th August to Lev/is, on the subject of including Sunni Moslems in the British Military Mission to Saudi Arabia. I have not previously pressed this matter strongly, but we have now, as a result of a visit by CGS HELP to Saudi Arabia to discuss details, received a very strong recommendation from General Dempsey himself that a small portion of the Mission should be composed of Sunni Moslems. I must, therefore, ask you to reconsider the matter. General Dempsey recommends that they should comprise (a) at least one instructor (Major or Captain) (b) three assistant instructors (Sergeants) (c) a Medical Officer (d) batmen for the officers above. I see from Lewis' letter of 16th July that, after being unofficially approached, CGS India held out little hope of Indian participation in this Mission. I njustv-say that I find it a little difficult- to appreciate the troubles which are foreseen over the request that the officers provided should be Sunni Moslems.

As Sir D* Monteath says, a similar proposal to send a British Military Mission tp Saudi Arabia ms considered about two years ago,&lt;rt the request of the foreign Office ^ me asked the Govemaent of India Aether they could make SuJBii Moslem Officers available (Ext. 1119/^4) and the Govemaent of India replied indicating their willingness to do this (G-ovemment of India telegram No. 3757 of 1st April, 1944-)* Complications then arose owing to the Americans wishing to take a hand and the proposal eventually came to nothing• In the present instance we have had nothing officially frcm the Foreign Office on the subject. I hax&gt;pened, however, to see a casual reference to the proposal about a month ago and rang up the Foreign Office to say that if they wanted us to help in getting the Government of India to release Indian personnel, tbsy would, no doubt, let us have the background. The Foreign Office* said that they thought it preferable to have British personnel rather than Indians and I did not, of course, pursue the matter. If we are now to take the matter up with the Government of India, we must presumably have a request to do so frcm tbs Foreign Office. The Govertment of India might think it worth their while to assist in this matter but if so they will presumably wish to be formally associated with the Mission. The .Yar Office argument about Middle East Oil seems a little far fetched/‘ ' fetched.

To: Secretary to the government of India, War Department. Sir, i am to in;orm you that H.M.G. propose that part of the assistance which they wish to give to King Ibn Saud should take the form of a Military Mission to Saudi Arabia, and to enquire whether the Gove&gt; nment of India would be willing to provide a proportion of the personnel for the Mission. It will be realised that Middle East oil is of considerable value to India and the importance of Saudi Arabia will increase in consequence. In which case the Government of India might secure considerable benefits from representation on the Mission. ihe proposed organization of this Mission is attached. It is intended that the Head of the Mission, the G.S.G.l and the Gommandant of the Officers School should be British, and that the remainder, consisting of 16 officers and 25 I.O.Rs should be seconded from the Indian Array. We are inlorraed that King Ibn Saud wishes a high proportion of Sunni Moslem personnel to be included in the Mission. It is understood that it is not the policy to select individual officers by religious sects, but i^ is requested that so far as possible Sunni Moslem personnel may be provided in order to facilitate the work o' the Mission, since such personnel would be 'persona grata' with the Saudi Arabians and he able to visit Holy Rl«ces such as Mecca to do business with the Minister of Defence should he be detained there. The Mission is to be paid for by H.M.G. and details regarding 1 rates O; pa^, , terms of service, etc., will be considered when your i agreement in principle is obtained to the seconding of Indian Army personnel for this purpose. It is hoped, that, notwithstanding the impending constitutional changes in India, the Government of India will agree to be represented on the Mission and to provide the necessary Sunni Moslem personnel. An early reply is requested in order that the remaining details may be considered.C.-in-C. o o7\ Military Mission to Saudi Arabia 1.

This Mission will be paid for by H.M.G., and War Office proposed that the Staff should consist of (a) British Army personnel - 3 Officers and 1 B.O.R. (b) Indian Army personnel - 16 Officers and 25 I.O.Rs. The War Office is anxious to meet King Ibn Saud* s request for there to be a high proportion of Sunni Moslem personnel on the Staff of the Mission.. 3. This proposal was referred demi-officially (flag D) to G.H.Q.(l) who replied (flag K) to the effect that if an official application was received for the provision of this staff it would be necessary to advise the Government of India to turn it down in view of the extreme shortage of officers. In regard to the Sunni Moslem personnel, it was stated that it was contrary to your policy to select individual officers by religious sects. 4. The War Office was accordingly informed of G.H.Q.(l)*s views, and was asked if the matter should be dropped. 5» It appears, however, that the War Office attaches great importance to this Mission, and to the provision of the required personnel. In a further D.O. (flag A) they have asked us to take up the matter officially suggesting thatj- (a) the Indian Governnent might like to be represented on the Mission owing to the value of Middle East oil to India, and the fact that the importance of Saudi Arabia will increase in consequence. (b) The Mission would derive value from having Sunni Moslem Officers as the latter, besides being 'persona grata” with the Saudi Arabians, would be able to visit Holy Places such as Mecca to do business with the Minister of Defence should he be detained there.-I —From: Brigadier R.'H.A.G.

(/•), General headquarters, India. /yy \iaA\V ■Reference the attached letter fro;;i the War Office on the subject of a Military Mission to ^ing Ibn Saud, about which I spoke to you the other day. The-War Office propose that this Mission, which is sent on behalf of would be paid by H.M.G. It is not, as I first thought, entirely Indian,in that the Head of the Mission, the G,l, and the Commandant of the Officers School, would be British. The remainder of the Mission, with the exception of one clerk I..A.C.C,, would be Indian, consisting of 16 Indian Army Officers and 25 I.O.Rs. These should, if possible, be of Sunni Mohommedans. We are asked to let the War Office know if the C. in C. would agree in principle to seconding Indian Army Officers for the purpose. We are also asked if we can give bbm Ibn Saud an indication that we can supply Sunni Mohommedans for a reasonable time. Providing India remains within the Commonwealth I do not see why she should not accept this liability on behalf of H.M.G. in view of the prestige which she is likely to gain from it. It appears to be more a matter for acceptance by the Government of India than C. in C., and I suggest you take Sir David Monteath*s advice as to the method of approach to the former. 28th June, 1946Whitehall 9400 Extension 200. The War Office, (la .0.4) Whitehall, S.W.l. BM/16 93/l (1,10 4) SECRET ft. 1946 It has 'been agreed between the various Departments concerned that part of the assistance which we wish to give to King Ihn Saud should take the form of a Military Mission, which would he paid for by KLG. The proposed organisation is attach'ed, and is baled on the rather sketchy information we have been able to extract from the Saudi Arabians. They are not very clear what they want except that, being strict Moslems, they v/ant a high proportion of Sunni Moslem personnel in the Mission. in this respect, about which I believe George Tangle has already spoken to you. It means a commitment of 16 Indian Army officers and 25 IGR s. The head of the Mission, GSQ I and the Qoiiimandant of the oTTice rs s'cHooi would oe British. ' for King Ibn Saud and to‘meet his wishes in regard to Sunni Moslems. Details in regard to rates of pay, terms of service etc can be dealt with later, but v/e would like to know whether the Commander-in-Chief India would agree in principle to seconding Indian Army officers for the purpose. A further point also arises. We would want to have a fair indication, before offering Ibn Saud the mission, whether we are likely to be able to supply Sunni Moslem officers for a reasonable tim e.- In the light of impending constitutional changes in India it occurs to me that we might in the near future be confronted with a demand from the Indian Government for the return of these officers and other ranks. Gan you give me an indication on this point ? 7e will, of course, if you think it Naturally we must turn to you for assistance We are most anxious to provide this mission Colonel J.L. Garter, M.C., vVar Staff, India Office. / necessary ...necessary? make it clear to King Ibn Saud when offering the mission that we are not free agents in the matter and that we cannot guarantee always to provide Sunni Moslems. This would cover the possibility of a future Indian Government electing to withdraw from the British Commonwealth, in which case, we would have to make other arrangements for providing the mission. '.7e hope to get the T all clear 1 from the Foreign Office soon, and I would be grateful for an early expression of your views.

Minster to SAUDI ARABIA considers that the Mission should be aaministratively self contained and to this end, the minimum staff which will be essential has been included above. It is assumed, however, that Batmen, Clerks, Cooks, Drivers, Interpreters, Mess Orderlies, Orderlies and Sanitary Dutymen will be found from local personnel, but if this is either undesirable or impossible, an increase in IOR and NCs(E) will be required up to the normal scales for these posts. 3 . Until further details are known as to the desirability of employing local peisonnel and their availability, it is not possible to forecast whether an administrative staff larger than that already proposed will be required; the establishment as above should, therefore, be regarded as a purely provisional one.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002bf_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2164</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002bf</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2164</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 6/91(2) 'Saudi Arabia: Policy of H.M.G.
