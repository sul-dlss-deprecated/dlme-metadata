The main topics of discussion in these minutes are British policy in Palestine and future British policy in Mesopotamia.The second half of the file contains correspondence received by Curzon regarding the workings of the Eastern Committee, which inherited the responsibilities of the Middle East Committee (ff 10-21). The correspondents are as follows: Maurice Pascal Alers Hankey, War Cabinet; Edwin Samuel Montagu, Secretary of State for India; Robert Cecil, Foreign Office. The letters discuss the dissemination of the committee's minutes among military representatives, the frequency and attendees of committee meetings, and whether the committee should be severed from the War Cabinet and absorbed by the Foreign Office's recently created Middle East Department. One letter touches on Anglo-Persian relations.Also included is a note by Curzon, dated 27 October 1918, regarding a memorandum from the advisory committee of the Foreign Office's Eastern Department (ff 17-18).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Meetings</topic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>War Cabinet, Eastern Committee</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>War Cabinet</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>War Cabinet, Middle East Committee</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Middle East</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Mesopotamia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Palestine</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign policy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001491.0x0002a7#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
