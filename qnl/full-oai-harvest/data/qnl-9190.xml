The papers show that British officials were reluctant to press for the stores to be allowed in duty-free in case the Persians renewed their demand made in 1932 for the complete evacuation of the Henjam base.The file contains approximately five folios of diplomatic correspondence in French between officials of the British and Persian Governments.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Henjam</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Naval supplies</topic></subject><subject><topic>Naval bases</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000181#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000181#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
