IaJ Koverabor* 1947« fo JVora time to time we receive* from the Ministry of Civil Aviation, requests originated by foreign aviation companies for permission for aircraft on charter flights to land at aerodromes in the Arab States of the Gulf* We usually pass such notifications on to yoii*by tele pram* 2* We understand that the procedure in force is that the foreign company concerned requests permission from the Ministry of Civil Aviation to make their flight, with landings at certain specified aerodro :es* In the case of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf the Ministry of Civil Aviation say that they inform you direct by telegram if the aircraft is British or Dominion, but aslc us to notify you if the aeroplane belongs to a foreign company. They also state that you are the sole channel of communioation between the Ministry of Civil Aviation and aerodromes concerned. However, they agree that it is normal for a foreign company making a flight firstly, to ascertain that the aerodrome or aerodromes concerned re capable of receiving the type of machine they are usin; and, secondly, for the pilot of the aeroplane to request permission to land at the next aerodrome before leaving the one from which he started. 3. In the case of commercial charter flights, it is not necessary, I think, for the permission of any of the Gulf Rulers to be obtained for landings at aerodromes in their territories. You may, however, none the less consider it desirable that we, or the Ministry of Civil Aviation, should continue, as at present to notify you by telegram in all cases. Would you kindly let us know whether you consider the pr sent procedure satisfactory, or whether there is any variation which you would wish to suggest* Lt.Col.Sir Rupert Hay, XDXa., The Residency, Bahrein.

The difficulty here was, initially, that H atm a lan a al r field, the civil airfield near Colombo, will not take Skymasters, and it was thought possible that, provided the Ceylon Government r-v-roed in principle, we should have to ask them if tiiey would agr e to the Dutch using Negombo, a R.A.F. station in the island. ^ny-Coronander Cox said trial he thought the H. / • *ould be abl e to nan die one landing each day, but ne *ould confirm this (see Note 1 below). 6. Mr* Retcliffe-Cousins pointed &gt;ut ths t the Inoian objecti to the Dutch air service had ostensibly been on the grounds that it 'ms b mill tary service, and it was only very rec^itly that tne Ditch had desig nated a civil sir carrier. The Government of India had not yet had time to grant an operat ing permit for this Dutch civil airline, even if they ^visaed to do so. The Chairmen sug ested that we should inform the Indian Gov rnment of our ap roach to the Ceylon Government (which *e were forced to do under our obligations as signatories of the Chicago Agreements) • 7* After discussion it was finally agreed that the Foreign Office should draft a telegram for despatch by the India Office to the Viceroy, suggesting that he might consider it d e si r j-b 1 e to in fa m th e Go v ; ma en t of I n di a of the Dutch approach, explaining that we felt obliged to grant tne rights re nested (subject to reference to Ceylon) and on airing whether in th-se circumstances the Government of India wished to maintain their own position. It was felt th? t the Government of In dir might be influenced by the fact that tne police action in Indonesia hadcevsed end taot the Dutch would be precluded from transporting arras by a civil air service. Meanwhile, the Colonial Office would infona the Gov m- ment of Ceylon of tne Dutch re uest and the action we proposed taking to meet it.t o £0 xhwa // ,* Mt) This docxament mtist 'ba paraphrased If the conanimleatlon o£ Its contents to an^r person outside G-OTeraiaent Service la authorised^ Typej^ ^ ^ PHO M Q&amp;YLQN (Sir M* Moore) TO S&gt; 0? 8a 0 00LQHIE3 .

Ranee, now acting as Political Agent Bahrain, suggests that it is desirable that the specific route to be followed by private aircraft along the Arab Coast of the Gulf should be designated. Personally (apart from forced landings) I cannot imagine anyone, other than perhaps a more than usually avid concession or notoriety hunter, wanting to land in the desert. 3. As for Bahrain, its only landing ground is at Muharraq and Article 4 of the l, Air Navigation Regulations for Civil Aircraft** lays down that no aircraft shall use as 'a place of landing or departure 11 any place other than the land aerodrome at Muharraq or the water aerodrome at Manamah; this might be brought to the notice of fliers on the route. 4. As you know, the only other serviceable aerodromes on the coast are at Sharjah (for “land* 1 planes) and Dubai (for 'sea** planes), and pending a decision as to whether these landing places are to be maintained in the future or not, it is advisable, in my opinion, to refrain from designating them the air ports which may be used on the Trucial Coast. ,,1 FILE COPY; GOVERNMENT OF INDIA- XA b/ Department.

Conditions have, however, now changed somewhat, owing to the improvement in aircraft and in conditions on the Arab coast generally, and you will see that the Political Resident now sees no strong objection to these flights being permitted. 3. We should accordingly be glad to have your views on the reply to be sent to the Political Resident. If it is decided to permit flights in future it will be necessary to arrange for intending flyers to be informed of the passport and visa requirements* Incidentally, with regard to paragraph 2 of the Political Resident*s telegram, I am not dear how Bagdad and Teheran cone in on the question of granting permission for aircraft to land at Bahrain and Sharjah. 4.

Sir, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to request you to inform the Air Council that the Saudi Arabian Minister called at the Foreign Office on the 16th September and said that he had received instructions from King Abdul Aziz to make a communication to His Majesty’s Government in the following sense. 2. King Abdul Aziz had lately been asked by His Majesty’s Government on more than one occasion for permission for aircraft to pass over Saudi Arabian territory. King Abdul Aziz had for his own part no objection at all to giving permission and was only too glad to be able to assist His Majesty’s Government in such matters. Unfortunately, the passage of such aircraft was noticed by his subjects, among whom were tribesmen whose knowledge of the outer world was small and whose suspicion of all things foreign was considerable. Although holding no sympathy with the views of such persons, King Abdul Aziz was bound to take into account their criticisms, which were to the effect that the passage of aircraft was a sign that he had sold his country to the British and that permission ought not to be granted. In these circumstances, His Majesty’s Government would avoid placing King The Secretary of the Air Ministry— King AlDdul Aziz in an embarrassing situation if they were to make requests for permission for flights by aircraft on very rare occasions only.. 3. The Saudi Arabian Minister was informed that the message would be forwarded to the proper quarter, 4, Copies of this letter are being sent to the India Office, Colonial Office and War Office. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,No. 1232. (E 5438/4668/65) 28th September, 1938. Sir With reference to Sir Miles Lampson's despatch No. 885 (697/1/38) of the 26th July regarding a proposed flight round the Arabian peninsula by Hassan Anis Pasha, I have to inform you that permission for the flight over the Aden Protectorate and along the Persian Gulf must be withheld* 2 0 In the opinion of the Air Officer Commanding at Aden, the range of the aircraft which Anis Pasha proposes to use is insufficient for certain stages of the route between Mukalla and Marbat, while there is no wireless telegraph or other communication between Mukalla and Muscat. The route proposed, which is the Royal Air Force strategic route, has not hitherto been used by civil aircraft anil the Royal Air Force cannot accept responsibility for a search if Anis Pasha is overdue. Moreover the only fuel along the route is the Royal Air Force strategic reserves, which are limited. 3. As regards the Persian Gulf it is the policy of His Majesty's Government to discourage private flights in this region. The Rulers of Kuwait and Bahrain have expressed to His Majesty's Government their unwillingness to allow any private aircraft to fly over or land in their territories. The Sultan of Muscat has not been willing to commit himself to/ C. H. Bateman, Esq.., C.M.G. , M.C., etc., etc., etc&lt;&gt;, Cairo.— to a general prohibition,, but it is certain that he would in most cases refuse permission^ ^ 4, I request fhat you will therefore inform the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in whatever manner you think best that conditions are not suitable for a flight of the kind proposed in those parts of the route which lie in the Aden Protectorate o^ the Persian Gulf States, I am with great truth and regard., P'ir, Your obedient Servant ?

There is, hov/ever, a connected point which I should like to 'bring to your notice. The Kov/eit, Bahrein and Muscat Civil Air Navigation Regulations all provide that aircraft shall not fly over or land in these territories except under a special authorisation issued by the Ruler concerned. King*s Regulations which were issued subsequently make the Air Navigation Regulations binding on persons who come under our jurisdiction and also set out the penalties to be applied in the event of breaches of the Air Navigation Regulations. But in the case of Koweit no penalties are laid down in the case of Moslem foreigners (who come under the jurisdiction of the Sheikh). The reasons for this are stated in Mr. Clauson f s letter to Mr. Rendel at the Foreign Office of the 2nd August,1935, No. P.Z.4701/35. Although therefore, effective action could be taken against Anis Pasha at Bahrein or Muscat it would appear that as things stand at present nothing could be done if he or any other Moslem foreigner made an unauthorised landing at Koweit. Now that aviation is becoming more popular in Moslem countries it is fl*.

Dear peel, We are sending you officially, under the same number and date, a copy of a despatch from the Embassy in Cairo regarding a proposed round-Arabia flight by one Hassan Anis pasha. 2. As you will gather from Lampson’s despatch, Anis Pasha is not altogether persona grata to us in view of his association with the National Flying- Corporation (which may have German backing) and his activities against Misr Airwork. This in itself is hardly perhaps, a reason for refusing him facilities which would be accorded to any other private applicant. But if we could legitimately withhold the desired permission on some ground of general application we should not be sorry. 3. I am sending a similar letter to Cowell, and a copy to the Air Ministry.

The normal procedure for dealing with this application would be for me to deal with the flight to Palestine myself and to consult the other competent British authorities direct regarding the flight over territories under their control.

Hassan Anis Pasha is described in No. 13 in the list of the leading personalities in Egypt, enclosed in my despatch No. 598 of May 21st, and Your Lordship will be aware of his recent activities in organising in company with Nabil Abbas Halim the National Flying Corporation, which has formed the subject of correspondence from this Embassy during the last few months, the last reference being in my letter to Mr. Kelly No. 226/4/38 of July 13th. 4.

I have only to add that in June last year, Hassan Anis Pasha informed a member of my staff that he proposed to make a circuit by air of Arabia. It was gathered that his chief interest was in the possibility of making his fortune by acting as a purchasing agent for the Imam of the Yemen of various mechanical stores and that he had been commissioned by the Imam to purchase arms on his behalf on which he fore saw a very considerable profit. He wished to know whether, if he dealt in business of this sort, he would get into the bad books of His Majesty f s Government. A non-committal answer was returned to the Pasha and nothing more was heard of his proposed flight. He is now reported to be in extreme ly difficult financial circumstances. 5. In the course of his conversation reported in the preceding paragraph, the Pasha stated that he was receiving assistance from the Royal Air Force for the flight which he proposed to make last year. I do not know if this was true, but in view of this statement I am sending the enclosed letter to the Air Officer Commanding regarding the flight now proposed. 6. I further enclose a copy of an interim reply which I have caused to be sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty^ Ambassador, Bagdad, His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, the Governor of Aden and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and Jerusalem. I have etc., (Signed) Miles W. Lampson. Ambassador.No. 697/1/38. BRITISH EMBASSY, ^ ALEXANDRIA. 26th July, 1936. Sir, I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding a proposed flight by Hassan Anis pasha over Arabia, Iraq, Palestine and Syria, together with copies of my reply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and of a despatch to the Foreign Office on the subject. 2. As stated in paragraph 4 of my despatch to the Foreign Office Hassan Anis pasha in the course of his conversation at this Embassy in June 1937 mentioned that he was being assisted in the flight which he then proposed by the Royal Air Force. I do not know whether this statement was correct, but it would be interesting to know whether Hassan Anis pasha has approached the Royal Air Force about the flight which he now proposes to make.

City Gate House, Finsbury Square, London,E.C.2. 28th April, 1938. Dear Symon, Reference our telephone conversation of this afternoon. Our Managing Director, Mr. Skliros, is going out to Baghdad in a week or ten days, and while in Baghdad he proposes to make an occasional trip to Bahrain in connection with certain negotiations which may then be in progress. He could probably secure a seat on the Imperial Airways plane from Baghdad to Bahrain without any difficulty, but equally probably he would find it impossible to get a seat for the return journey from Bahrain to Baghdad because so many people will be flying home from India and Persia about that time. In the circumstances he is very anxious to obtain permission to use one of our own planes to take him from Baghdad to Bahrain and back from Bahrain to Baghdad, as occasion may arise. The plane he would use would be a twin engine Dragon Rapide owned by the Iraq Petroleum Transport Co. Ltd., and of British registration. These planes are piloted and serviced by Imperial Airways* pilots and engineers and they fly regularly on the Company’s business in Palestine, Transjordan and Ira^. It would be equipped with wireless. If the necessary x^ermission is to be obtained from the India Office, Mr. Skliros would be greatly obliged if you would put the necessary machinery in motion. But if it is some other authority to whom we should apply, perhaps you would be good enough to put me on the road which would lead to the necessary permission being obtained with the least possible delay.

So far as His Majesty's Government are concerned they would have no objection to occasional prospecting flights of this nature being made, provided always that the Company adhere to any local civil aviation regulations and that, should they intend using any landing ground in that area they take steps to ensure that there is no likelihood of hostilities on the part of the local inhabitants. Before any survey is made over Muscat territory the Political Agent, Muscat, should be informed.

The Government of India do not wish to prescribe any special conditions as to the route, but the normal requirement to arrive at and depart from a customs aerodrome wil] apply. In view of the long range of the aircraft, tney deem it desirable to advise that the pilot should follow the normal route between Rangoon and Allahabad rather than a direct crossing of the Bay of Bengal. The Governor General in Council is also pleased to exempt her from the operation of rule 6(1} of the Indian Aircraft Rules, 1920, in so far as that rule requires her to carry a certificate of airworthiness in respect of the air craft which she intends to fly. 2. The Government of India note that two small hanu cameras wil be carried by Miss aarhart, and should she desire to take any aerial photographs in India and Burma, I am to say that the Governor General in Council is pleased to permit her to do so provided that no photographs are taken of prohibiten areas, palaces, mosques, sacred places, and Royal Air Force ana Army landing grounds. 3.

As regards proposal to fly from Karachi to Aden, this will presumably involve crossing the Arabian territories of Muscat. If you and the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf (to whom a copy of these papers is being sent) agree, I propose to suggest that U.S.Ambassador should be informed that no flights over the Arabian territories of Muscat are permitted without special authorisation from the Sultan and that there is no hope of permission being obtained from His Highness at the present time for private flights in this area, In view of the fact that so far as I am aware the Sultan (unlike the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit) has not actually requested His Majesty’s Government to refuse any application for private flights over his Arabian territories, the Resident will no doubt consider the advisability of approaching His Highness with reference to the present case (if he is back in his coital) and obtaining specific authority for such refusals.

Government’s policy to avoid the development of civil flying in the areas under review, there appears to be a considerable difference between the use of aeroplanes by a company of this nature, whose air activities would be entirely local and to some extent controlled by the Resident or his representatives in the Persian Gulf - and private flying as such by individuals. in i^rinciple to Petroleum Concessions Limited operating aircraft in Qatar, subject to the provisos contained in paragraphs 7 and 8 of your letter, and provided the air survey company to be employed is a British firm of undoubted repute, entirely under British direction, and employing only British nationals or natives of Qatar.

In our telegram of the 8 th April we asked the Political Resident for his views on the Company’s proposal, and I now enclose a copy of his reply dated 14th April. 2, The position under the various concessions (or draft Concessions) is as follows:- (*) Qatar . In Article 3 of the Commercial Concession, the Company 'shall explore the State of Qatar minutely 'by any method which is Best in its opinion. Ur Under Article 10 tfeey entitled to import aeroplanes free of duty. Under Article 6 it 'has,the right to use all the means of transport required for its operations in accordance with this agreement, excepting aerial transport, which, on every occasion arising for it the Company must obtain the Sheikh’s permission and consent thereto'. Under article 6 5973 5000 3.37of the Political agreement any right given hy the Company under the Commercial agreement to utilise means of transportation hy air is made subject to any general regulations for civil aircraft made hy the Sheikh on the advic^ (ffuu au a* tjU' ue tyahtA tuiul+fia**) of H.M.G. Under Article 5 the Company \ gives a general undertaking at all times to pay due deference to the advice of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. f^J lrucial Coast States. Under wr Article 9 of the^Debai Commercial Agreement (whicn^is a common forw agreement for the Trucial States as a U (fU h'fUl) whole) the Company has the right to i import aircraft free of duty. Under Article 11 the Company has the right to construct, maintain and operate aircraft and buildings and landing places for aircraft. It may also instal and operate without hindrance all such means of transportation by land, air and water as are necessary for its operations under the Concession. Under Article 6 of the Political Agreement any right given to the Company by the Commercial Concession to utilise means of transportation by air, is made subject to any general regulations for civil aircraft made by the Sheikh on the advice of H a nd to any instruc tions which may be issued by the Political Resident in the Persian/ * f* Mt*! TwM CinJ- Stic?J ,, 4 -- UfW K. J: ■ • Draft Paper. 5973 5000 3.37 Department. Persian Gulf. There is also in Article 5 the general undertaking to pay due deference to the advice of the Political Resident and his subordinates. (c) Muscat. The present idea is that any Muscat Comrnercial concession and / /v Political Agreement would be on the same lines as those in regard to the Trucial Coast States. 3 It is clear, therefore, that so far as aerial transnort is concerned, the Company has, or will have, the necessary rights under the Commercial concessions. In the case of Qatar the necessity for the previous consent of the Sheikh is clearly laid down, as Colonel Fowle points out in his telegram, while in the Trucial Coast draft concessions, the previous consent of the Sheikh is not bJT. specifically required: fhe Company wild- presumably consult the Sheikh beforehand in any case. &lt;C As regards aerial survey , there does not appear to be any specific provision in the Commercial Agreement, but presumably it may be taken that 'transportation'' includes survey. ti t The position under the Political Agreement^ is that in regard to Qatar H.M.G./H.M.G. have an indirect control over the Company^ actions in tills matter, while on the Trucial Coast (and in Muscat) they will have the specific right to issue instructions through the Political Resident* Apart fromy'What io actually laid down in the Political Agreements, however, it is presumably open to H.M.G. in practice, provided they act reasonably, to permit or not to permit thle use of aircraft by the Company in this area, and the Company seem to recognise this fact in their letter of the 24 th ^March. We now come to the question of the precise answer which should be given to the Company. As you will see, the Resident does not appear to see any objection in principle to the use of aircraft for transport or survey by the Company, but v/hile he would allow it at this stage in Qatar, he is inclined to think that it is papornaturc for the Company to consider using aeroplanes fftr ■frhe present on the Trucial Coast or in Muscat. On the question of principle there does not seem to be any reason why we should dissent from the Residents view. We are, of course, concerned to avoid any development of private flying on the Arab Coast, and we are also indirectly concerned with the security ofDraft Paper. Department. the Company’s operations and employees. On the first point there is obviously a clear distinction between private flying as such, and the use of aeroplanes by a Company holding a concession from the Ruler in question. Moreover, we have already agreed that the Kuwait Oil Company may use aeroplanes for its operations. On the second point, there is no reason to suppose that the Company’s employees would be running any more risk by flying than they would by going about on land. In fact I suppose it is probably the case that flying would actually be safer than going about by land. In the case of survey, particularly, the fact that the aeroplanes would do the job in such a very much shorter time than a land survey is. X, KXlk /uu tli no doubt, an argument in their favour from the security point of view. It might, however, be a good plan, if the Air Ministry agree, that we should tell the Resident to consult with the local air authorities as to the suitability of the aircraft and other equipment ItWMf 5973 5000 3.37 which the Company to use^ We would accordingly propose, if the other Departments agree, to inform the Company that H.M.G. see no objection in principle to the use of aircraft for transport or survey, provided that (a)/(a) the consent of the neleTOni- Sheikh is obtained beforehand and the area over which the Company would propose to fly explained to him; (b) that the Resident or the Political Agent is kept in close touch with the Company’s plans and is consulted as to the suitability of the aircraft , *4. if and equipment (e.g. wireless), ^ As regards the specific proposals £ ft of the Company, we would propose to info nr them that they migjkt go ahead as soon as „ &gt; 7 / 11 &lt;/*' • they like vrith ‘the Sheikh of Qatar^y but that they should take steps to ensure that the Ml aeroplanes not operate in any area further south than the Resident or Political Agent woul# feel to be safe, in view of the claims of Ibn Saud to some of the territory in this area. We would, however, suggest to ^ Oulonel Pawlcjln advice^ that they should not for the present take any steps in regard to the Trucial Coast or a fortiori in regard to Muscat, for the reasons which Colonel Powle gives. cf. As the Company asked us on March 24th for an early reply we should be most grateful if you would kindly let us have an answer as soon as possible.

In addition, we are hoping to obtain an Option or Concession from the Sultan of Muscat very shortly. Our experience with geological reconnaissance in this part of the world to date has shown that the lack of water, the lack of roads, and the difficulty in obtaining supplies makes progress extremely slow. In other parts of the world it has been found that an aerial survey can often give more useful results than reconnaissance on the ground, and that such results are obtained in a tithe of the time. We would therefore like to investigate the possibility of arranging aerial transport for our geological parties working in these areas.

Rickett did not land at Bahrain or Sharjah on out ward journey but on return journey landed at Sharjah, on October 4th, on ground of engine trouble. 4. Rickett then telegraphed asking for release of aeroplane as he was travelling home on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer, Jodhpur, for immediate treatment for duodenal ulcer haemmorrage for which he had had two blood transfusions before leaving London. 5. In the circumstances I felt compelled to release aeropj.ane and in any case it would have been undesirable to let him remain on the Trucial Coast. 6 . I have checked up on his statements. Resident Jodhpur states 'Rickett consulted Ward professionally and/and left for Karachi with his knowledge'. Engine trouble is reported to have been bad ignition and dirty plug. It is not easy to determine whether engine failure and plea for release of aeroplane are genuine. 7. Eickett and party stated at Sharjah that they were interested in the place and nothing more and asked for* cars but were told that they could not go about owing to small-pox. Rickett talked of Ibn Baud's gold fields and asked if bits of gold were f j-i id in black sand in any places. Shaikh did not see the party.

B&gt; Minute Paper. political Department. /y / * Please see the note on P.Z.7277/36 below about Mr. Pickett’s recent flight down the Persian Gulf and his landing at Shargah. From the Bushire telegram dated 16th October,which has since been received, it i-s evident (as one would in any case have suspected) that Mr.Pickett’s talk about himself being ill and his machine being in need of repair was all bluff. He has successfully got away with it this time, and it is only a question what action, if any, is possible to prevent a repetition of the incident. 2. Colonel Loch in his telegram suggests^that in future Mr.Pickett should be refused any request for travel documents for the Persian Gulf area, and that his aeroplane should be refused clearance for this area. As regards the second proposal, there seems no point in dealing with the actual a.eroplane. Presumably Mr.Pickett is quite likely to sell it or to use other aeroplanes for future flights. It will no doubt be sufficient to take action against Mr.Pickett himself. 3. It is accordingly proposed to suggest to the Foreign Office that he should in future be refused any endorsements or visas for the Arab States in the Persian Gulf. Colonel Loch’s recommendation also includes Persia, but this is a matter which we must presumably leave to the decision of the Foreign Office. Sven if it were likely to do any good it would hardly be logical to suggest that Mr.Pickett should be refused endorsement for Persia (e.g. for Tehran or North Persia) merely on the ground that he violated the Air Navigation Regulations on the Arab side of the Gulf. 4.

In this connexion the Turkish press (who gave him and his aeroplane plenty of publicity) stated that his visit here was for the purpose of ’’negotiating the exploitation of” the oilfield near Sinop in which Yunus Nadi is interested - please see our despatches 291E of 23rd May and 358E of 27th June. &lt;Ve hear that when the United States Embassy were asked to get authorisation for the ^lane to fly over Turkey, they were not told that Rickett was the name of the passenger. We hear also from the United States Embassy that Rickett was met at Yesilkoy aerodrome by Yunus Nadi so that there seems to be something in the Press statement.

The need for specifying appropriate penalties has since been felt and after consultation the Foreign Office, Air Ministry, Goverijnent of India and Political Resident, drafts have Ly 'iZ /‘dttf now been prepared. It was originally proposed that the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit and the Sultan of Muscat should issue Regulations strrd at the same time^king T s Regulations under the respective Orders in Council ehou-i-d a-lso—b-e issued. In the opinion of the Resident and the ^ 33*l/ Jr Government of India, however, it is only necessary to advise the Ruler himself to make a Regulation in the case of Muscat, as, in the case of Bahrein, foreigners come under the Order in Council, whilst in Koweit all foreigners except Moslems come under the Order in Council. The penalties proposed are those provided for in the respective Orders in Council, but the Political Resident considers that it is preferable to lay down that the ?z ^r/ 3 r penalty of imprisonment should only be imposed in the case of default of payment of a fine. It was also suggested that one penalty to be enforced might be a refusal of refuelling facilities. It was, however, pointed out that this penalty would be superfluous as the Regulations provide for the confiscation of the aircrafts . ,f~ &gt;i &gt;\of' ' r O-rdfrt ■ Com//X »r ^ 1Z. 330 ) It is submitted that the draft Regulations may be approved and forwarded to the Foreign Office for concurrence and issue. 3939 5000 7/35 ’X Legal/ Xr /lr/' / (M) !

The first object of the proposed Kin^s Regulations is to provide ’’for securing the observance of any treaty or arrangement for the time being in force relating to any place within the limits of this order or local native law or custom whether relating to trade, A j commerce , revenue or any other matter” (in this case the 0 ** C- 7 fWvX , w Civil Air Agreements).

We have had various examples of this lately. The Political Resident in framing King’s Regulations in regard to arms traffic and pearling at Bahrein inserted a clause specifying penalties. The Government of India, however, cut out these clauses, maintaining that the penalties were automatic under the Orders in Council.

The Marquess of Zetland agrees with the Government of India and Political Resident in the Persian Gulf as to the desirability of such Regulations and has no observations to make on the drafts as amended by the Government of India, except that he does not think it advisable to adopt the Government of India’s suggestion in regard to the specific insertion of 'aircraft', at any rate in its present form. If aircraft are separately specified as an addition to the category in question, it would appear to suggest that aircraft would not be included in the expression 'goods, receptacles/receptacles or things” which however are the only objects in respect of v/hich for feiture can be authorised under the terms of the relevant paragraphs of the Orders in council. If the wording submitted by the Resident is to be altered, His Lordship v/ould prefer to let it read 'goods, receptacles, or things (including aircraft)”. 3. Since the regulations provide for the confiscation of the aircraft, His Lordship considers that it would be superfluous to include, as an additional penalty, the refusal of refuelling facilities. 4. If Mr. secretary Eden agrees with the terms of the proposed King^ Regulations with the modifications suggested, and subject to the observation^ of the Air Ministry to whom a copy of this % letter is being sent, I am to request that the usual steps may in due course be taken with a view to the formal allowance| of the Regulations. Copies of the draft Regulations in the modified form suggested are enclosed for facility of reference. The Foreign Office will, however, no doubt consider whether, as may appear preferable, the Regulations should be issued under Articles 83, 70 and 78 of the Koweit, Bahrein and Muscat Orders in Council respectively without th$I the draft enclosed. (In this connection reference is invited to Lord Monteagle f s letter of 29th May, 1930, No.E.2722/2722/ 91). 5. I am to observe that the Secretary of state, in his letter of 4th February, No.P.z.463/36, suggested that a King’s Regulation might be issued under the Bahrein Order in council to regulate the possession and traffic in arms. If Mr. Secretary Eden concurs in that suggestion and takes steps to allow the Regulation, the present proposed King’s Regulation under the Bahrein Order in Council will, of course, become No.2 of 1936 and not No.l as stated in the Political Resident’s draft.

Part III.— Criminal Matters. 15. — (1) Subject to the other provisions of this Order, the Code of Criminal Procedure and the other enactments relating to the administration of criminal justice in British India for the time being shall be applicable to Kuwait. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf shall hold and form a Court, to be called the Chief Court, which shall have all the powers of a High Court of Judicature : the Political Agent at Kuwait shall be deemed to be the District Magistrate and Sessions Judge; the Judicial Assistant to the Political Resident shall be deemed to be the additional District Magistrate and additional Sessions Judge; and the powers of the Governor-General in Council and of the Local Government under those enactments shall be exercisable by the Secretary of State, or, with his previous or subsequent assent, by the Governor-General of India in Council. Notwithstanding, in any case triable by a subordinate Magistrate under Chapters XVI to XXIII inclusive of the Indian Penal Code if both the complainant and defendant are Muhammadans and are acquiescent in such procedure, the Political Agent may order the case to be tried by a Qazi, a representative from the Agency attending to record briefly the proceedings. In such suits the judg ment passed by the Qazi shall not be carried into effect until it is ratified by the Political Agent, and the Political Agent shall have power to revise the finding and sentence as if the Qazi were a sub ordinate Magistrate, or to return the case for retrial to the same or another Qazi. The sentence of the Qazi when ratified by the Political Agent, shall for all purposes be regarded as if it were the decision of the Political Agent in the District Court.9 (2) Any jurisdiction exercisable by the Chief Court in criminal matters under this Order may be exercised by the Judge of that Court either within the limits of this Order or elsewhere. 16. In cases in which the Code of Criminal Procedure requires . the sentence of a Court of Session to be confirmed by the High Court, the sentence shall be referred for confirmation to the Governor-General of India in Council instead of to the Chief Court. Where a person subject to the Order is accused of the com mission of an offence, the cognisance whereof appertains to the Court, and it is expedient that the offence be enquired of, tried, determined, and punished in a British Possession, the accused may (under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, section 6) be sent for trial to Bombay. The Chief Court may, where it appears so expedient, by warrant under the hand and seal of the Political Resident, cause the accused to be sent for trial to Bombay accordingly. The warrant shall be sufficient authority to any person to whom it is directed to receive and detain the person therein named and to carry him to and deliver him up at Bombay, according to the warrant. WTiere any person is to be sent to Bombay, the Court before which he is charged shall take the preliminary examination, and shall bind over such of the proper witnesses as are British subjects in their own recognisances to appear and give evidence on the trial. 18. — (1) The Political Resident may from time to time, subject to the directions of the Governor-General of India in Council, by general order under his hand and seal, prescribe the manner in which, and the places at which, sentences passed by the Court are to be carried into execution in Kuwait, and may appoint any- building or place specified in the order to be a prison for the purposes of this Order, and such persons as he thinks fit to be gaolers, keepers or officers of any such prison. (2) If at the place at which any Court is held there is no place or building appointed as a prison in accordance with the preceding sub-Article of this Article, it shall be lawful for any Court, by ordei or warrant under the seal of the Court, temporarily and for the pur poses of any particular case or cases, to appoint any place or build ing specified in the order to be a prison for the purposes of this Order, and such persons as the Court thinks fit to be keepers in such prison. (3) A warrant under the seal of the Court shall be sufficient autho rity to the person or persons to whom it is directed to deliver and detain the person named therein according to the warrant at any prison appointed in accordance with the preceding subWrticles of this Article. 19. — (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 20 of this Order, the Political Resident may, by warrant under his hand and ■ I... ~tto 10 \ « 9 it Jt r Ci JL iUi. c ie\ r oO i seal, order any person convicted by the Court and sentenced to imprisonment, to be sent to and detained at any prison in Kuwait specified therein. Such prison may be a place appointed in accord ance with the provisions of sub-Article (1) of Article 18, or a place appointed temporarily and for the purpose of the particular case. (2) The warrant of the Political Resident shall be sufficient authority to any person to whom it is directed to carry and delh^r up the person therein named and to receive and detain him at^!e prison named, according to the warrant. (3) In any case where a person sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one month is detained in a prison temporarily appointed in accordance with the provisions of sub-Article (2) of Article 18, the Court by which the sentence was awarded shall report the case and the circumstances thereof to the Political Resi dent for his directions. (4) Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 20, the Political Resident upon the receipt of such report, may make an order under sub-Article (1) of this Article, or may direct that the sentence shall continue to be served at the place where the prisoner is at present detained. 20. — (1) Where an offender convicted before any Court under this Order is sentenced to imprisonment, and the Political Resident proceeding under section 7 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, authority in that behalf being hereby given to him, considers it expedient that the sentence should be carried into effect elsewhere than within the limits of this Order, and the offender is accordingly sent for imprisonment to a place outside the limits of this Order, the place shall be either a place in the Presidency of Bombay, or a place in some other part of His Majesty’s dominions, the Govern ment whereof consents that offenders may be sent thither under this Article, or a place in which by treaty, grant, usage, sufferance, or other lawful means His Majesty has jurisdiction, provided that if a person is not a British subject he shall only be sent under this Article to a place in His Majesty’s dominions. (2) A warrant under the hand and seal of the Political Resident shall be sufficient authority to any person to whom it is directed to receive and detain the person therein named and to carry him to and deliver him up at the place named according to the warrant. 21. —(1) In cases of murder or culpable homicide, if either the death or the criminal act which wholly or partly caused the death happened in Kuwait, a Court acting under this Order shall have the like jurisdiction over any person to whom this Order applies who is charged either as a principal offender or as an abettor as if both such criminal act and the death had happened in Kuwait. (2) In the case of any offence committed on the high seas or within the Admiralty jurisdiction by any person who at the time of committing such offence was on board a British ship, or by anyBritish subject on board a foreign ship to which he did not belong, the Court shall, subject to the provisions of this Order, have juris diction over such person as if the offence had been committed within its jurisdiction. (3) In cases tried under this Article no different sentence can be passed from the sentence which could be passed in India if the crime were tried there. *'*4) The foregoing provisions of this Article shall be deemed to be adaptations, for the purposes of this Order and of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, of the following enactments, namely :— The Admiralty Offences (Colonial) Act, 1849; The Admiralty Offences (Colonial) Act, 1860; The Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, Part XIII; and those enactments shall apply accordingly, and be administered in Kuwait. 22. W here a person is convicted of an offence the Court before which he is convicted may, if it thinks fit at any time before he is discharged, require him to give security to the satisfaction of the Court for his future good behaviour, and for that purpose may, if it thinks fit, cause him to come or be brought before the Court. 23. (1) Where it is shown by evidence on oath, to the satis faction of the Court, that any person to whom this Order applies has committed, or is about to commit, an offence against this Order, or is otherwise conducting himself so as to be dangerous to peace and good order, or is endeavouring to excite enmity between the people of Kuwait and His Majesty, or is intriguing within the limits of this Order against His Majesty’s power and authority, the Court may, if it thinks fit, by order under its seal, prohibit that person from being within the limits of this Order, during any time therein specified, not exceeding two years, or alternatively may require him to give security for his future good behaviour. (2) The Court, by order in writing under its seal, may vary any order of prohibition (not extending the duration thereof), and may revoke any order of prohibition or removal. (3) The Court shall forthwith report the order and the grounds thereof to the Chief Court, which shall forthwith report to the Governor-General of India in Council every order made under this Article, and the grounds thereof, and the proceedings thereunder. 24.— (1) If any person to whom this Order applies fails to give security for good behaviour or for keeping the peace when lawfully required to do so, or fails during the continuance of the security to keep the peace or be of good behaviour, or fails to comply with an order of prohibition made under this Order, the Court may, if it thinks fit, order that he be deported from any place within its jurisdiction as prescribed by this Order.(2) If the order of deportation is made by the Court, it shall forthwith report to the Chief Court the order and the grounds thereof. (3) Thereupon the person ordered to be deported, unless the Chief Court thinks fit otherwise to direct, shall, as soon as prac ticable and in the case of a person convicted either after execu tion of the sentence or while it is in course of execution, be re moved in custody under warrant to the place named in the warr^.

Subject thereto, the expenses of deportation shall be de frayed as the Secretary of State, with the concurrence of the Treasury, or the Governor-General of India in Council, with the previous or subsequent assent of the Secretary of State, may direct. (6) The Chief Court shall forthwith report to the Governor- General of India in Council every order of deportation made under this Order, and the grounds thereof, and the proceedings there under. (7) If a person deported under this Order returns to Kuwait without permission in writing of the Chief Court, or the Governor- General of India in Council, or the Secretary of State (which per mission the Chief Court, or the Governor-General of India in Council, or the Secretary of State respectively may give), he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two months, or with a fine which may extend to 1,000 rupees, or with both.

The next step is, therefore, to prepare a draft of the Regulations to be issued by the Sultan of Muscat, and draft Kings Regulations in respect of Bahrein, Kuwait and Muscat, on the lines^agreed demi-officially with the Resident and. the Government of India.

Dear Clauson, In Renders absence on leave I am replying to your letter, No. PZ 4701/35 of the kind August about the penalties to be imposed on aviators breaking the Air Navigation Regulations for the Arab States in&lt; the Persian Gulf. ki. We agree generally with the proposals you have worked out in conjunction with Fowle. As regards Muscat, we think that it is clear that the only way to proceed is to induce the Sultan to make a regulation with the appropriate penalties, which he will have to enforce himself on those foreigners who come within his jurisdiction. From a practical point of view it is, of course, essential that the Political Resident should approve the substance of the regulation and the penalties contained in them, but this point will be safeguarded if the regulation is drafted by the Resident and if he M.J. Clauson, Esq.can subsequently ensure that the Sultan would consult the Political Agent before taking any action against a foreign aviator. 3. In order to deal with persons under our own jurisdiction we agree that a King's Regulation will have to be made under Article 78 of the Muscat Order-in-Council, a translation of the Sultan of Muscat's Air Navigation Regulations being annexed to it, and the King's Regulation stating that they are binding on the persons specified in Article 8 (l), (&lt;0 and (3) of the Order-in-Council. The Regulation should then prescribe the penalties for breach of the conditions governing air navigation, and Beckett points out that it is important to note that the possible penalties are limited by the terms of Article 79 of the Order-in-Council, which should be borne in mind in preparing the draft. 4. We agree that it is not necessary at the present moment to do anything as regards the Trucial Sheikhdoms. The only one of these where it seems likely that we may have to make air navigation regulations in the fairly near future and therefore to prescribe penalties of thissort is probably Qatar; we should presumably be able to do this in the same way through a King’s Regulation, in accordance v/ith the provision for issuing King’s Regulations which will doubtless be embodied in the prospective Qatar Order-in-Council on the lines of Articles 83 - 85 of the Koweit Order-in-Council. 5. We agree with your proposals in regard to Bahrein and Koweit, but Beckett points out that the King’s Regulations must of course be drafted so as to conform with the provisions of the Order-in-Council under which they are made, namely Articles 70 and 71 in the case of Bahrein, and 83 and 84 in the case of Koweit. 6. We notice that your proposals allow for the penalties being those authorised by the respective Orders-in-Council (with the exception of penalties for foreigners in Muscat where the Sultan will issue a special regulation), but we are not clear as to how you intend to bring in the possible refusal of re-fuelling facilities. It will presumably be easy for the Sultan of Muscat to include this among the penalties imposed by his own regulation, but the Orders-in-Council do not appear to contain any provision which could be held to cover a penaltypenalty of this sort, (although the mention in them of 'forfeiture” would presumably cover the actual seizure of an aeroplane). It would seem however that the refusal of re fuelling facilities must be dealt with by some order binding- on the authorities of the aerodrome where the refuelling would take place i.e. not as part of the penalties but in the other part of the regulations. 7. We agree that the next stage should be for the Resident to be invited to prepare drafts of the necessary regulations, and we presume that you will let us see them as soon as they are available.)u&amp; AIR MINISTRY, GWYDYR HOUSE, WHITEHALL, LONDON, S.W.1. /l September, 1935.

My dear Fowle, Would you please refer to the papers forwarded by the Air Mail of 8th July under No. P.Z. 4626/35 regarding a proposed flight by an Italian machine from Rome to Sharghai, via the Arab Coast? I now enclose a copy of the reply which the Foreign Office sent to the Italian Embassy on 8th July from which you will see that owing to a misunderstanding the Italians were informed that it was 'contrary to the policy of His. Majesty's Government to authorise private civil flights' along the Arab Coast. The position is of course in fact that the prohibition is one imposed by the Arab rulers themselves; and it is undesirable that there should be any misapprehension on the point. We understand from the Foreign Office (Southern Department) that they may have a convenient opportunity soon of making matters clear. 2 ./ The Hon. Lieutenant Colonel T.C. Fowle, C.B.E., H.B.M.

Although it might have been more in accordance with our facade policy that the penalties should in each case be laid down by the Rulers themselves, we are inclined, on reconsideration, to agree that it will be sufficient to proceed at present as suggested by the Resident and the Government of India.

FLIGHTS OF PRIVATE AIRMEN OVER ARABIAN LITTORAL.188/9/35. *% p i, 16th April, 1935* My dear Bailey, You will remember that in October 1933 the Iraqi Govern ment agreed to have notices put up at Rut bah, Shaibah and Bagdad airports warning private aviators not to fly over the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf* The text of this notice is as f oilows* It is understood that private airmen are not allowed to fly over the Arebian Littoral of the Persian Gulf between Kuwait and Sharjah. Private airmen passing through Iraq on their way to the Persian Gulf are hereby warned accordingly and advised that they should apply to the competent authorities, failing which they will be considered to be flying without authorisation and will subject themselves to difficulties in their flight over the said Littoral. This rule has recently been broken by an airman flying from India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has therefcr e asked the Government of India to put up a similar notice in Indian airports, the text of which is as follows* S Viat0rs P^* not permitted to fly over the Arabian Goa- P ersl an Gulf. Any such aviators doing so will be considered as flying without authorisation and will be liable to be dealt with accordingly. Colonel * owle* s draft is shorter and in some ways more satisfactory than that at present posted up in Irao,, and as it furthermore seems desirable that the notices on the matter should be everywhere the same, you might consider the possibility of subs- ' tutin g the new draft fof that at present in use. «11 you let me know if you find it possible to act on this suggestion ? Yours sincerely, Sd. C.H.BATEMIN. y.s. bailey esq,.■■■■ (E 2678/17/91) My dear Gilbert, 1 In your letter No.p.Z*2693/35 of the 26th April to me you asked for our views on the Resident’s suggestion that an amended notice about the prohibition of private flights along the Arab Coast should be posted up on the Bagdad and Shaibah aerodromes* the 3rd April (a copy of which was sent to us under cover of your P.L. No.P.Z.2693/35 of the 24th April) was sent to the Embassy at Bagdad and I have no doubt they will let us know v/hether they think Powle’s suggestion practicable* Remembering, as you do, the difficulty with which the Iraqis were persuaded to put up the present notice, I am myself inclined to think that they will refuse to put up an amended notice as drastic as Powle’s draft. In any case, I think we I see that a copy of Fowle’s express letter of should J.G. Laithwaite, Esq., C.I.Eshould do better not to approach them until the necessary penalties have been devised: but, when that has been done, it is just possible that the Iraqis will bow to a fait accompli and help us to make our control of the route effective. In the meantime it seems to me worth considering whether the principal thing is not to get the various air-touring organisations (the Automobile Association, the Aero Club etc.) to make it quite clear to British air tourists (who make up 90% of the traffic through the G-ulf) that they must not follow the South shore• C^at the Air I am sending a copy of this letter to Bertram Ministry.

Class (a) comes under the jurisdiction of the Sultan, who would doubtless consult the Political Agent in taking suitable action. As regards Class (b) the Muscat Order*in“Council does does not contain any general clause making tne breacn of local regulations a punishable offence under the Grder- in-Council. A King’s Regulation under Article 78 (b) of the Order would therefore be necessary. 3. On the Trucial Coast and C^atar there are at present neither local Air Regulations nor an Order-in-Council. The introduction of both into these areas would involve difficult and lengthy negotiations with the several Shaikhs, and in view of the fact that private aircraft have little inducement to land in this area, I do not think that either Air Regulations or an Order-in-Council is called for. , / J.G.Laithwaite Esquire,C The India Office, London- 2 - 4. In Bahrain and for all practical purposes in Kuwait (since breaches of the Air Regulations by Moslem foreigners are not likely to be frequent) both British and Foreign subjects fall under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent. As the Orders-in-Council contain no general enabling claAse, King's Regulations under articles 70 (b) of the Bahrain Order in-Council and 83 (b) of the Kuwait Order-in-Council would oe necessary. 5. As regards the penalty to be imposed (paragraph 4 of your letter) it seems necessary to advise only the Sultan ot Muscat (who will have to deal himself with foreign subjects) to make provision for a fine of Rs. 1,500/- In the case oi British subjects in Muscat and all persons in Bahrain and Kuwait the penalty is already provided in sub-sections (2) and (3) of Sectons 79, 71 and 84 of the Muscat, Bahrain ana Kuwait Orders-in-Council respectively. In addition to the penalties prescribed in these Sections, forfeiture of the machine could be prescribed in the King's Regulations tnem- selves.

My deal’ F'owle, Would you please refer to Metcalfe’s demi- official letter to you, F.104-L/33, of 6th February,of which he sent a copy to me, about the sanctions to be applied in the event of breaches of the Air Navigation Regulations in Bahrein, Koweit, etc.? You may care to have these interim observations. 2. The regulations in question are based on the discussions which we had here in the spring of 1934 and at which you (and also Prior) were present. My recollection is that at that stage we rather shirked this question of the penalties to be imposed and thought we could leave the matter open until we had further experience - possible difficulties about jurisdiction being one of the points which appeared to require further consideration, particularly in regard to the Trucial Coast. But it now looks on the whole as though we should do better to face the issue and endeavour to provide some The Hon’ble Lt.Col.T.C.Fowle,CBS., OOPY SEN'T BY AIR Bushire. appropriate/* 2 . appropriate penalty. So far as the actual Montaigu case is concerned I am rather inclined to thinlc that it may he simplest to let it drop (since, as you will remember, it was on the one hand impossible not to give Montaigu a reasonably friendly reception, as he was a Director of the I.P.C.,while on the other he was, in fact, gate-crashing, as the other groups had not been anxious that any representative of the French interests in their company should be present at the discussions at Bahrein. It seems unlikely in these circumstances that even if we did make representations to the I.P.C. they would carry us much farther forward). 3. As regards the nature and scale of any penalty to be provided, the Air Ministry inform us demi-officially that in this country an offence against the Air Eegulations is punishable by a fine not exceeding £200, or by imprisonment not exceeding six months, or by both a fine and imprisonment. Under the Indian Aircraft Code (Clauses 10 and 11) a fine not exceeding Es.1000 may be imposed in India. Under the Bahrein and Koweit Orders in Council we / 4.we iiave jurisdiction over foreigners and over their property within the limits of the Orders (in the case of the new Koweit Order aircraft are definitely specified, and, if effect is given to a proposal recently mentioned to you that a revised Bahrain Order should he prepared, we could make similar provision in the case of Bahrein), Prima facie , therefore, though we have not considered the matter closely, there would seem to he no obstacle, assuming that the local ruler had first agreed to the imposition of penalties on such lines as we might decide to recommend, to the making of King’s Regulations under Article 70(h) of the Bahrein Order and Article 83(h) of the Koweit Order n for securing the observance... of any native or local law, or custom, whether relating to trade,commerce,revenue, or any other matter', i.e. in this case, such penal provisions for a breach of the Air Navigation Regulations as might he made by the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein. The Orders in Council in question further provide that such King’s Regulations may provide for forfeiture of goods (e.g. in this case the offending aircraft) and that breaches of the King’s Regulations may he punished by imprisonment :not exceeding three months or by a fine not exceeding Rs.1500, or by both imprisonment and a fine. Subject/4. Subject to closer examination it looks on the whole as though it would be possible for us to advise the Rulers to make provision for a fine of up to Es.1500 (alternative punishment of imprisonment of forfeiture of the aircraft being kept in reserve for use in particularly flagrant cases). 5, Muscat is, of course, in a different position, since the extent of our jurisdiction over foreigners and their property appears bo be governed by Article 8 (3),(4) a,nd (5) of the Muscat Order in Council, and our jurisdiction over foreigners is for practical purposes confined to cases where the Government whose subjects they are has 'agreed 'with Eis Majesty for or consented to the exercise of power or authority by His Majesty'• It looks at first sight as though we have no jurisdiction at all over property belonging to foreigners in Muscat. Subject to these reservations the arrangements for making King's Regulations under the Muscat Order in Council are similar to those in the case of Bahrein and Koweit. It would appear in these circumstances as though any penalties laid down for the contravention by persons other than British subjects or individuals covered by the Order in Council of the Muscat Air/Air Navigation Regulations would have to he imposed by the Muscat authorities themselves, but difficulties in securing that they should on our advice make provision for appropriate penalties on the same basis as referred to above in the case of Koweit and Bahrein would not presumably be serious. 6. The Trucial Coast and Q,atar are, of course, as Metcalfe points out, more difficult because of the absence of an Order in Council giving ex-territorial rights to British and foreign subjects. But (save possibly in Qatar) the point is perhaps of less immediate active importance, since, at this stage at any rate, there are perhaps likely to be fewer attempts by or inducements to private civil aircraft to endeavour to land there than in the case of Bahrein,Koweit,or possibly Muscat. 7. The quite provisional suggestions put forward above may we hope facilitate consideration of this question. the Once we have received your views and those of/G-overnment of India we shall be prepared to take the question up with the Air Ministry and Foreign Office at this end.Mr. Laithwait e I talked to Mr. Burkett of the Air Ministry about this (Mr. Bertram is at present abroad). He said that in this country an offence against the Air Regulations was punishable by a fine not exceeding £200 or by imprisonment not exceeding six months, or by both a fire and imprisonment. He suggested that penalties we have jurisdiction over foreigners and over their property within the limits of the Orders (in the case of There seems, therefore, to be no obstacle to making King’s Regulations under Article 70(b) of the Bahrein Order and Article 83(b) of the Koweit Order 'for securing the whether relating to trade, commerce, revenue or any other matter”, i.e. in this case the Air Navigation Regulations laid down by the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein. It is also laid down under the Bahrein and Koweit Orders in Council that such King’s Regulations may provide for forfeiture of goods (i.e. in this case the offending aircraft) and it is also prescribed that breaches of King’s Regulations may be punished by imprisonment not exceeding 3 months or by a fine not exceeding Rs.1500 or by both imprisonment and a fine. It seems, therefore, that we shall have to be content with a penalty of Rs.1500, but this seems quite adequate since\it will be seen from the attached copy of the Indian Aircraft Act (Clauses 10 and 11) that in India a fine not exceeding Rs.1000 is considered atfequate. No doubt the usual punishment to be imposed in these cases would be a fine, but the power to d~b~e imposed Bahrein and Koweit. Under the Bahrein and Koweit Orders in Council the new Koweit Order aircraft are definitely specified). observance of any native or local law or custom impose/2 . impose imprisonment or forfeiture of the aircraft could be kept in reserve for use in particularly flagrant cases. In the case of Muscat the position is more difficult. The extent of our jurisdiction over foreigners and their property in Muscat appears to oe governed by Article 8(3), (4), (5) of the Muscat Order in Council (copy attached). It will be seen that in general jurisdiction over foreigners is confined to cases where the Government whose subjects they are has '• agreed with His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of power and authority by His Majesty' 1 . We appear to have no jurisdiction at all over property belonging to foreigners in Muscat, afu*. Subject to the above, the arrangements for making King's Regulations under the Muscat Order in the Council are simila.r to those in the case of/Bahrein and Koweit Orders. I am not quite clear as to the position of foreigners in Muscat^ (in practice there fl^'~'* &lt; * y ’P ro t )a t )1 y' are no European foreigners^there), but it seems possible that any penalties laid down for the contravention a of the Sultan's Air Navigation Regulations would have to * W* V C, ; t . b — ^ be imposed by the authoritjesof the Muscat Government ^ 1 L j - itself. The case of Muscat, however, does not seem to t; y I.i w be so urgent as those of Koweit and Bahrein and the matter might be left over for future consideration. We might now write to the Foreign Office and the Air Ministry consulting them and setting out the position as explained above before taking the question up with the Resident and the Government of India? r/3Vf -Jr STATUTORY RULES AND ORDERS, 1915.

( „ould you please refur to the correspond ence ending with your printed letter !lo.l072-v of 34, dcted the 2lst Hoveraber 1934, sending us copies of correspondence which you had with His M Josty’s Charge d* Affaires, ifeighdstd, regarding the litncilng of a French aeroplane In Bahrain without permission. It appears that to this case no penalty was actually Imposed upon the French avla&amp;or for his breach of the Air navigation Regulations for the territory of liahrato (copy received here from the India Office under covor of their No.F.Z.4121/1934 of 3rd August 1934). From a study of the Regulation.; referred to above together with those for Kuwait, and also of those more recently promulgated for the territory of Muscat (vide enclosure to your Despatch Ko. 1042-3/34, dated the 9th November 1934, addressed to His Majesty's secretary of state for India) It seems clear that no penalties have to fact been prescribed for breach of these regulations. In all three cases Regulation Ho. 14(111) merely states , i ~ * that 'if any person contravenes or falls to cccr ly withwith these negulatlona or any provision thereof he shall he dealt with according to the law*'. The difficulty is one of general application to Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat, while similar difficulties may also arise In the case of aharjah which is a regular aerodrome, and jxjssihly over the other /jrah states cxi the Trueial Const and in Tatar, In the event of landings In those places. persons contravening the regulations now in force In Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat will presumably always he Europeans or other foreigners who are not subjects of the Shaikhs, end it would therefore appear possible for us to issue a King’s Regulation under the ordersin-Council in force in each ahaikhlaa, prescribing penalties for breach of the air regulations by foreigners. I am to ask for your views as to whether such a Regulation should now be Issued and if so what penalties could suitably be enforced thereby. In this connectIon I forward for your information a copy of the Indian Aircraft Act which provides penalties for breach of aircraft regulations in India. It will be seen that the offence out of v/hich the present discussion arose is similar to that penalised by section 13 of the Act. 2. with regard to Sharjah, Tatar and the Trucial Coast generally there is of course no OrderOrder-In-Oounc11 in force giving extra-territorial rights to British and foreign subjects. rhe position is explained in your d|3ml-offIclal letter to Laithvaiite No.l869-B, dated the 4th December 1933. In these Bhaikhdoms theoretically no doubt British and foreign subjects are under the shaikhs’ Jurisdiction, but In actual practice we would not permit a British or foreign subject to be dealt with by the uulers. In this area presumably the best we could do would be to treat each case as it arises on its merits after coming to an agreement with the Shaikh concerned for the discourage ment of flights by foreign aircraft. In the case of Uiarjah of course we already have mi agreement which is confined to flights by British aircraft only, and therefore by implication discourages flights by other aircraft.

We enclose a copy of Lepissier*s reply to our letter of protest. In view of the welcome which he says was extended to Montaigu at Bahrain, we thought the incident might be considered closed, and therefore -held up a drait to you which we had prepared on the subject. In due course, however, we received from Bushire the despatch No. 1071-S of 21st November to which you refer. As requested therein we communicated to the Iraqi Government the air clearance document given Montaigu at Shaibah, asking for an explanation (cf. enclosed copy of our note, dated 10th December). No reply has yet been received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but we are sending them a reminder. We also enclose a copy of our despatch of 28th December to Bushire informing them of the action taken, expressing regrets at the trouble caused all round by Montaigu’s behaviour and suggesting that, if the particular case were to be pursued further, the India Office might take it up with the Iraq Petroleum Company, of which Montaigu is a Director. As Bushire were apparently under the impression that the Consulate at Basra had been at fault in giving Montaigu a visa without reference to Bahrain (cf. paragraph 2 of their despatch) we thought it necessary to insert a paragraph putting the matter in its proper light. Yours ever, CHANCERY. Eastern Department, Foreign Office.S^ri No. 716. His Majesty’s Enibassy present their compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and have the honour to inform them that on October 22 nd last Monsieur de Montaigu, a French national, arrived at Bahrain from Iraq, without authorisation, in his private aeroplane. 2. This gentleman had been provided by the Customs authorities at Shaibah air port with an Air Clearance Document, the original of which is enclosed herein, and which is endorsed ’Bahrain direct’. As the Ministry are aware, the flight of private aeroplanes over the territory of Bahrain is not permitted, and His Majesty’s Embassy will be glad to learn the circumstances in which the authorities at Shaibah air port furnished Monsieur de Montaigu with the document in question. His Majesty’s Embassy avail themselves of this opportunity to renew the expression of their highest consideration. British Embassy, Bagdad. 10th December, 1934. •(275/13/34) British Embassy, Bagdad. 28th December, 1934. (S 2 S) Sir, With reference to your coniidential despatch Xlfris No. 10 71-s of 21st November, I have the honour to tr£/nsmit to you herewith a copy of a note which I have addressed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting information as to the circumstances in which the authorities at Shaibah are port supplied M. de Montaigu with an Air Clearance Document endorsed ’Bahrain direct’. The reply of the Iraqi Government will be transmitted to you in due course. 2. In paragraph 2 of your despatch you raised the question of the visa supplied to M. de Montaigu by His Majesty’s Consulate, Basra. It has been ascertained from Mr. Hendry, who was at the time in charge of that Consulate, that M. de Montaigu did, in fact, conceal from him that he intended to proceed to Bahrain by air. 3. I note that the visa rules framed by Mr. Consul Selous, in collaboration with a previous Political Agent, were intended to facilitate travel between Bahrain and Basra of genuine Bahraini and Basra merchants only. There is, however, no clear indication of this intention in the rules, which might, I consider, be re-drafted with advantages; and I trust that you will agree that no blame attaches to the Acting Consul, Mr. Hendry, who was not aware of any circumstances making the grant of a visa undesirable. 4./ The Honourable The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.4. I fully realise the necessity for authorization in the case of flights to Bahrain, and I would suggest that, if this particular incident is to he pursued further, the hest course would he for the India Office to take up the matter in London with the Iraq Petroleum Company, of which M. de Montaigu is a director. Although the fault seems to have lain exclusively with him, I am very sorry indeed that His Excellency the Shaikh of Bahrain and you yourself and Colonel Loch have heen put to so much trouble in the matter. I have, etc. (Signed) F.H.Humphrys.I enclose copies of correspondence noted in the margin 1. Letter dated the 24th October 1934, from 0.

It will be seen from the correspondence that Montaigu applied to the Embassy for permission to fly to Bahrain and was informed that special permission for the flight would have to be obtained from the Political authorities in the Gulf. In spite of this M. Mcntaigu proceeded to Basrah, and concealing the fact from the Acting Consul there that he was travelling to Bahrain in a private plane, procured a visa for that place 'under false pretences'. I think it would be a good thing if the matter could be reported to the headquarters of the Iraq Petroleum Company as suggested by Humphrys. I am sending a copy of this letter to Humphrys and Loch.

In fact once we allow exceptions the rule will probably have to go to the board. In connection with Bahrain please see my Express Letter No. 982-3 of 8th August 1933, and in connection with Kuwait my Express Letter No. 1390-3 of 11th December 1933. 2. It is unfortunate that Monsieur de ^ontaigu succeeded in avoiding the regulations which were being applied at Baghdad by obtaining a visa from the British Consular Officer/at Basrah. H© may have withheld the information that he intended to fly to Bahrain. In this case he may have been granted a visa under the rules framed by Mr. Consul Selous, in collaboration with a previous Political Agent at Bahrain, for use in the passport section of the British Consulate at Basrah v ie q copy enclosed. This was a useful working arrangementi mmmm intended to facilitate travel between .Bahrain and Basrah of genuine Bahraini and Basrah merchants with out a previous reference to the Political Agent and I certainly think that it might continue. It was not meant, however, to he applied to foreigners in general, such as M. de Mentalgu - whose case is covered hy paragraph 7 of foreign Office Circular Bo.

I note that the visa rules framed by Mr. Consul Selous, in collaboration with a previous Political Agent, were intended to facilitate travel between Bahrain and Basra of genuine Bahraini and Basra merchants only.

Apart from the political complications caused by the activities of aviators such as the Mr* M* iison /referred 'he *i£ht Honourable sir John :imn, 0 * c.8* z*, K.C.V*o., etc*, etc., etc*referred to in the second paragraph of your despatch Ho. 611 # Air Headquarters are particularly anxious to avoid the rislc of an aviator heing forced down and lost at some inaccessible spot on the Arabian littoral and obliging the Royal Air Force to undertake troublesome and expensive search operations. 3« It was not anticipated that the Irani Government would make any difficulties about acceding to this request, but in view of the unreasonable attitude which they adopted in reply to the note free His Majesty’s Embassy Ho. 294 of June 7th, Mr* Ogilvie-Forbes felt obliged to correct the misunderstanding under which they were labouring, and with this object the note Ho# 377 of July 80th (referred to in the fourth paragraph of your despatch No. 611) was addressed by His Majesty’s ^iabassy to the Ministry of Foreign /iffairs. It was not until June 84th that Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes received from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf a copy of his despatch No. 663-3 of June 14th to the Government of India, which showed that the Shaikh of Bahrain was the only ruler who gave formal notice of his objections. It was, how ever, made elear in the third paragraph of the note of July 20th that it waa the rulers of States concerned who did not p^nait flights over their territory, and although the Ghaikh of Bahrain has hitherto been the only one to give formal expression to hie objection to unauthorised civil flights over hi® State, th© attitude consistently adopted by the other Ruler© appears to amount in fact to a refusal to allow them to fly through their territories. I do not think in any case that it would have been advisable to have had notices posted (as suggested by the Officiating Political Resident in his express letter) warning aviators that the Shaikh of Bahrain did not permit civil aviators to fly over his territory since the effect of singling out Bahrain might have been to give readers of the notices the ijapreesion that a difference /existedexlateA tm attltwi* of that aad ±ba othar Aral) StatMi la tna t-alf, and that thare «aa aa otojaation to flights over the latter. 4 . m spite of the note of •nily 80th frsn Hia i.ajesty's iabasay the Ira^i overniient sere disposed at first to aaln- tain their previous attitude. -*• a result of ay pereonal intervention with the rine ^Anlster they have now changed their ainde* and 1 have the honoar to enoloae a aopy of a note fron the Kinistry of Voreiffa Affaire, eowsunioatlng a copy of the notice which the authorities have been instructed to post in ths traffle offices of ths aerodrome® oo.wjcrned.

In view of the contentiousness of the issue 1 do not think it advisable to revert to the natter with a view to Indueiiv. the Xregi Qevcraaowt to alter ttie terws of the notice, whioh do not appear to conflict with the policy outlined in the second paragraph of your despatch he. 611. 6 .

It proved that at an earlier aate (June 7th) the Ambassador, at the request of the A.O.G., had informed the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs that 'permission could not he obtained hy civil aviators to fly along the ^radian coast of the Persian Gulf, as this route is at present open only to aircraft of Imperial Airways and the R.A.F.', and suggesting that notices containing a warning to this effect should he posted in the traffic warnings of the civil aerodromes at Autbah, Ghargah and Baghdad West. Notices of this nature are open to objection in any event as being inconsistent with our facade policy, but apart from that they were ill- received by the Iraqis, who refused to take any action on the lines suggested. A copy of the correspondence, which we have now received from the Air Ministry, is on P.Z.6025. It will be seen that the Embassy returnedr 4 2 to the charge on 20th July with a modified form of ^ notice, which, however, is still inaccurate, since it refers to the ’’rulers of the states concerned on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf”, whereas we have in fact secured a prohibition only from the Sheikh of Bahrein. 2. The Foreign Office have prepared the draft instructions to Baghdad after informal discussion. Colonel Fowle thinks that we should now instruct the Resident to obtain a letter from the Sheikh of Koweit similar to that already obtained from the Sheikh of Bahrein, but would not take any action as regards the Trucial Coast at the present stage. He agreed that action might be postponed in the case of ioiscat, firstly because of the Sultan’s absence in Dhofar; secondly because the position here is less simple, owing to the fact that there is no serious objection to the use of Gwadur on the Persian route by private fliers. 3.

Dear 19th September, 1933. 5 jasr ¥ith reference to your letter (K.5165/11/91) of the 14th instant, in the light of discussions which took place when the policy which was to be adopted to govern civil aviation generally on the Arabian Coast route was under review, we agree that whatever is done in practice,control must at any rate appear to rest with the sheikhs concerned. That being so, any action which might tend to give the Iraqi’s or anyone else the impression that we are exercising this control directly is open to objection and to that extent we are in agreement with your views. We think, however, that there could be no objection to the Political Resident, through the Ambassador,and acting on behalf of the sheikhs concerned, asking for notices on the same lines as those proposed by the Air Officer Commanding,to be posted at Iraq civil air stations, and would be glad to have your views on this alternative suggestion. A notice on these lines and referring only to private fliers could hardly, in our view, be wrongly interpreted by Foreign powers. After the unfortunate episode of Wilson’s flight, we agree with the A.O.C. Iraq that something should be done to make the prohibition of private flights more generally known, and in particular that it should be brought to the notice of private fliers before they leave Iraq if they are going in an easterly direction.

In addition to the above consideration the Ministry will readily appreciate that the geographical and climatic features of the North Arabian coast, together with the necessity for flying over long stretches of open sea, render it essential that this route should not be open to civil aviation in general, and should be restricted to military or commercial aeroplanes suitably equipped and supported by an adequat 3 ground organisation* It is therefore desirable in the interests of the safety of life /thatthat aviators should he warned that tliey are not allowed to fly along this route* A warning such as that sugrested would, moreover, be in the interests of the Iraqi Government themselves since ignorance of the present position would inevitably load to aviators being turned back and forced to return unexpectedly to Iraq, thereby causing probable inconvenience to the Iraqi authorities* 5* His Iiajesty f s Embassy trust that in the light of the above explanations the Iraqi Government will now see their ?/ay to post at the three civil aerodromes the necessary notices of warning* 6* His Majesty's Embassy avail themselves of this opportunity to renew the expression of their highest consideration.

Please see departmental note dated 2nd June, flagged K below, and the report now submitted by Colonel Fowle (P.Z.4071/33) on kr. Ivaurice Wilson’s recent flight along part of the Arab Air i^oute. The report speaks for itself. It is, however, satisfactory that the Political Agent, Bahrein, should be of opinion that kr. Wilson's action was taken more or less in good faith. 1 2. The interdepartmental conferences attended by Colonel Fowle in the spring of this year agreed that in present circumstances private fliers, whether British or foreign, shoulu be excluded from the Once/E xtract frcm prirate and peraonal letter - Colonel Fowle to Mr&gt;Laithwaite, dat ed iTth June 1935^ I am sending you by this mail a copy of a letter which I have written to the Government of India on the subject of Mr.Morris Wilson’s escapade, (please see my Printed letter No. 664-S of 14th June 1933). You will see from Loch’s letter that he thought Mr.M.W. acted more or less in good faith. However, he was undoubtedly a nuisance, and we must do our best to stop repetitions of such incidents. I think the way I suggested is the best, pending the regularization of the Air Route by proper agreements with the Shaikhs concerned. I do not propose to get the necessary request, that private aviators should not land in their territories, from the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Sultan of Muscat, as this might lead to delay. The Shaikh who is not very amenable these days might raise difficulties, and the Sultan is away at Dhofar and is out of touch, and in any case Gwadur, which is the only part of his territory concerned, is on the Persian route, and any private aviators using that route must, I imagine, land there.CONFIDENTIAL.

Prior to 1946, the correspondence is concerned with the British policy of maintaining a strict prohibition on flights by private aviators and on chartered flights by airlines. From 1946 onwards, the correspondence is more concerned with facilitating private and chartered flights through the aforementioned states; British restrictions on private aviation had to be lifted once Britain became a signatory of the Chicago Convention (1944).Specific measures covered in the file include: British efforts to convince the rulers of Bahrain, Kuwait, and Muscat, to delegate to them the authority to refuse private aviators access to these territories; a subsequent effort to obtain, from the Shaikh of Bahrain, permission to grant access to Bahrain to private flights; and measures taken to notify aviators of the restrictions in place (prior to 1946) on private flights through the Arabian Coast Route.Another topic covered in the file is the introduction of sanctions for breaches of the Air Navigation Regulations for Bahrain, Kuwait, and Muscat. The sanctions were specifically aimed at deterring private aviators from using the Arabian Coast Air Route without prior authorisation. The file therefore includes copies of draft notices of the introduction of King's Regulations in 1936 under the Kuwait Order in Council (folio 374, final edition on folio 364), the Bahrain Order in Council (folio 375), and the Muscat Order in Council (folio 376). It also includes a draft notification of regulations to be introduced by the Sultan of Muscat and Oman (folio 373).Copies of a number of orders in council have been included in the file:The Kuwait Order in Council (1935): see folios 399-414The Bahrain Order in Council (1913): see folios 415-427The Muscat Order in Council (1915): see folios 428-441The details of a number of flights, or proposed flights, made by private aviators are recorded within the file, either as a result of an unauthorised landing or a proposal to fly through Arabia. This includes the following: the landing of Maurice Wilson at Bahrain in 1933, the landing of Mr de Montaigu at Bahrain in 1934, the landing of Francis William Rickett at Sharjah in 1937, a proposed round the world flight by Amelia Earhart in 1937, and a proposed circular flight round the Persian Gulf by Hassan Anis Pasha in 1938. From 1946 references to private flights become much more common, and the details supplied much more brief. However, basic itineraries of proposed flights (including details such as dates, times, and stopping points) can still be found within the file.The French language content of the file consists of a small amount of correspondence received from the French Embassy in London, and a single letter from the Belgian Embassy, also in London.The main correspondents in the file are as follows: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent at Bahrain, the Political Agent at Kuwait, and the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat. There is also correspondence with officials of the following departments: the Air Ministry, the Foreign Office, the India Office (the Commonwealth Relations Office from August 1947), the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India (External Affairs Department from 1937), and the Ministry of Civil Aviation. It also includes correspondence with British representatives from around the world, a few letters from various oil companies, and diplomatic representations from Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and the United States.There is no correspondence in the file for the years 1939-45.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Francis William Rickett</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Bahrain Air Navigation Regulation (1936)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Muscat Air Navigation Regulation (1936)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Private flying</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commonwealth Relations Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Civil Aviation</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Amelia Mary Earhart</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Hassan Anis Pasha</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Maurice Wilson</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Bahrain Order in Council (1913)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Kuwait Order in Council</topic></subject><subject><topic>Muscat Order in Council</topic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Kuwait Air Navigation Regulation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000207#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
