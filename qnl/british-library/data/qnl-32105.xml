I now enclose herein a copy of a letter from the Admiralty in which the question is discussed whether or not it is to be assumed from the charts enclosed in Sir John Ward’s letter that the Persian Government intend to establish a second light on Tanb* 3. It seems most likely that the reason why Tanb is included in the charts is that given in paragraph 2 of the Admiralty’s letter, namely that, as a light is already established there, account has simply been taken of its existence and its continued maintenance assumed as part of the general scheme. Moreover, since the charts were presumably obtained in confidence from the Aga Gas Company at Stockholm there would be objection to asking the Persian Government what their intentions are in this particular respect.

M e were of opinion that if an aero-marine ligst •' reT were to be xst installed • •••• •••installed? the extra cost, both initial and recurring, should be borne by the Aero Companies concerned. The Committee observed that on investigating this question, the share to be borne by the P.3.L.3. Pund, both initial and recurring, may be considerably reduced. .4. After a lengthy discussion on the financial position of the Fund, the Committee decided that the f oil owing matters be referred to the Govt, of India for favourable considerations (a) That, owing to the already large excesses in the Surplus Fund, no further additions be made .hereto. The receipts and expe nditure of the P.G.L.3. Fund should be balanced in the future, with an opening and closing balance for each year fixed at Rs . 30 , 000 /- . (b) That the Surplus Fund be restricted to Rs.six lakhs, the amount in excess being refunded to the Shipping that helped to build up the fund. fith reference to para. 4 of Commerce Dept, letter 1 To. 306.IAII (4)/37 of 25th September 1937, the Committee remarked that there was no question ot refunding any of the surplus revenue to the Trade darried, as the fluctuations in the rates of light dues levied do not affect the rates charged by the Shipping Companies on. the trade carried* The Committee were however desirous oi knowing u basis of calculation by which Government fixed the Surplus Fund at Rs. six lakhs. (c) That any new initial outlay required, e.... for the purchase of Lightships, etc., be provided out of the Surplus Fund, depreciation thereon being paid out of ooe working expenses . (d) That an early decision be reached in the matter of levying lightdues on shipping entering Bahrein. 5. The Committee observed that the financial position of the current year as explained, to them showed uhat even allowing &amp; rebate of 5 pie&gt; Per ton, the Fund could afford to lay by Rs .59,000/-, which definitely Proves that the lirhtdues are levied at a higher rate than necessary6 . The Committee decided to consider the Budget Estimates for 1938-39 when replies ha,ve Been received from the Govt, of India on the points raised above. 7 . Tr.

It will be seen from this correspondence that nothing has yet been definitely settled in regard to placing a light on Stiffe Bank, but that Sir John Ward feels unable to agree to the Shatt al Arab light-vessels being moved from its present position# As the Flag Officer for his part states that it is essential that the Bahrain light-vessel shoald remain where it is, the only solution would appear to be th. ,, as suggested in the correspondence, an additional light-vessel for reliefs should be provided. 3 I am sending a copy of this desnatch to the Government of India.

Advisory Committee, it should be noted that this was a recommendation only. Government of India letter No. 306 -M.Il(20)* 37 dated 20/1/38 appears to contain definite instructions to be given effect to in the event of there being no objection to the course namely - the exchange of the Kais Island Lightvessel with that marking the Palinurus Shoal and placing the latter on Stiffe Bank. 3. There is, however, very strong objection to the proposal to effect a temporary exchange of the Bahrein Lightvessel, attention to which was called in the minutes quoted, and both my Committee and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, consider such a course highly undesirable. 4. Under the circumstances, therefore, I suggest the following procedure to be adopted on receipt of information that the Iranian Light on Kais Island is functioning - (a) Shatt-al-Arab Light temporarily replaced; (b) Shatt-al-Arab Light placed on Stiffe Bank; (c) Kais Lightvessel placed in position formerly occupied by Bhai‘t“'9-I'' i ^^ a ^ ) * • -it the necessity of even This procedure will obviate temporarily/temporarily removing the Bahrein Lightvessel. 5.

Memo: In reply to your letter No. PG/663 dated 11th February, 1938, and the Government of India letter No*306-M.II (20)-37, dated 20/1/38, it is considered that the removal of the Shatt-al-Arab Light Vessel and its temporary relief by a buoy would be a worse evil than if the same procedure were adopted in the case of the Bahrein Light-vessel; on account of the great amount of shipping using the Port, and the fog and dense sand storms which prevail* In addition to which, I would like to dock the Shatt-al-Arab light before placing her permanently on the Stiffe Bank. I am also quite certain that the Anglo Iranian 0 Co. would not like the idea of the temporary replacing of the Shatt-al-Arah light vessel hy a huoy at this time of the year. (Signed) J.C. #AHD.

The opinion of Representatives of Shipping Companies and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, is very strongly averse to the removal of the Bahrain Lightvessel, even as a temporary measure, with which opinion I am in full agreement. If you are unable to make arrangements for the temporary removal of the Shatt-al-Arah Lightvessel (such as the normal annual relief), will you please investigate the possibility of placing a Light Buoy on Stiffe Bank, as a temporary measure, until a Lightvessel is available. In this connexion, the Committee have suggested that it might be advisable to obtain a spare Lightvessel for purposes of reliefs. I shall be glad if you will favour me with your remarks on the above proposals at an early date. (Signed) Captain, R.I.N. for Rear-Admiral.i/38.

LIGHT ON STIffFK BANK, In reply to your letter dated 12th March a buoy on Stiffe Bank is not considered practicable. The least water on the Bank is 15 fms.» consequently the excessive weight of moorings plus sea growth would seriously reduce the buoyancy of the buoy. All three lightvessels are due this year for docking and overhaul; consequently the light float normally used as a relief vessel is required. I agree with the Committee that the provision of an additional Lightvessel for reliefs is necessary. The light float now used as a relief vessel is not considered an efficient substitute for lightvessels in open waters. (Signed) J.C.

In paragraph 4 of Mr. Seymour’s despatch No. 49 (204/3/58) of February 10th, of which he was good enough to send me a copy, he stated it would be of interest to have Sir John Ward’® views upon the suggestion that the technical questions involved in the new arrangements for the lighting and buoying of the Persian Gulf, should be settled by a oeetin, of qu&amp;lifi; d experts on the British and Iranian sides. Mr. Morgan has discussed the matter with Sir John lard, who thinks it unlikely that the Iranian authorities would consent to any such meeting and adds that, according to his information, the lights which are being erected in the Gulf are being supplied by reliable firms and that great care has been taken in their si lection. 35 . sir John lard also states that the Iranian authorities have so far acted in conformity with the suggestions made at Tehran in 1935 at the meetings which he attended at the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the effect that due notice should be given of the installation of lights and of the times at which they were to be tested 4.

I am to enclose also copy of a despatch which has been addressed to His Majesty's Charg'd d'Affaires at Bagdad requesting him to ascertain unofficially from Sir John Ward whether he considers that the proposed meeting of qualified experts on both sides is in the present circumstances desirable or essential. 2. Lord Halifax considers that no useful purpose would be served by pressing the Persian Government any further at this stage on two of the three points referred to in paragraph 3 of Mr. Seymour's despatch, namely co-operation with the Bombay Lighting Committee of shipowners, and the limitation of dues to the amount necessary to cover the operating costs and the depreciation of the lights and buoys in service, although he would see no objection if Lord Zetland thinks it desirable, to asking His Majesty's Representative at Tehran whether, in his opinion, it would, be advantageous to address ' ^^r-Secretary of State, India Office.address to the Persian Government an acknowledgment of the assurances already received on these points on the lines originally suggested in Mr. Eden’s despatch No.50 of •2nd February 1937 to Tehran. With regard to the third point (the dues payable by Admiralty oilers) he is inclined to think that it may be better to take no further steps for the present, but he would prefer to defer reaching a definite opinion until he has received the observations of the Admiralty. 5. Similar letters are being sent to the Admiralty and Board of Trade, and a copy of this letter is being sent to the Dominions Office.

With reference to my despatch Ho. 441 of the 29th Hovember, 1957, I have the honour to enclose a copy of a note which I have received from the Iranian Government regarding the installation of new lights in the Persian Gulf. It will be seen that this note refers to communications from His Majesty^ Legation concerning both the general question of the future policy of the Iranian Government with regard to lighting and buoying services in their territorial waters, and the particular question of the provision of adequate warning of the introduction of any new lights. 2. In so far as concerns prior warning of the entry of new lights into service, this note, though less precise than might be desired, is fairly satisfactory. But as a reply to the representations made by His Majesty f s Legation on the general question of lighting and bouying in the Gulf, it is disappointing. The only part of its contents applicable to the general question is the repetition in writing of the assurance already given orally that no steps will be taken for the removal of an existing light until the light which is to replace it is completely ready, and even this is a little ambiguous seeing that the removal devolves upon British authorities. 3. The note contains only the most indirect referenc to Mr. Butlers letter to M. Ansarie of the 13th March, copy/ he Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C. , M.P., • t • 9 etc etc etc.ILi-LpU- © copy of which was enclosed in my despatch No. 100 of the same date. The Iranian Government have never replied to this letter, nor given any answer regarding the three points mentioned therein which were not covered by the now abandoned draft Protocol, namely co-operation with the Bombay Lighting Committee of shipowners, the dues to be paid by Admiralty oilers, and the limitation of dues to the amount necessary to cover the operating costs and the depreciation of the lights and buoys in service. Nor does the note refer to the suggestion made in accordance with the instructions contained in your despatch No. 411 (E 6192/HV^4) of the 2nd November, 1937, that the details of the new arrangements now necessary might be settled by a meeting of qualified experts on both sides. f 4. I am not entirely clear that the piecemeal taking over lights now contemplated by the Iranian authorities may not possibly render such a meeting of experts unnecessary. When therefore the Counsellor to this Legation reminded the Head of the Third Political Section orally of the various points left unanswered, he abstained, on my instruction, from pressing this particular proposal. I enclose a copy of a letter in which Mr. Butler set out the points he had raised in his conversation, and I should add tnat he ascertained definitely from M. Zenjani that the Ministry s note under reference was intended to be the repxy that M. Adi promised me should be sent to Mr. Butler’s detailed letter to M. Ansarie of the 13th March, 1937. As regards the meeting of experts it would be interesting to know whether Sir J. Ward considers this proposal in the present circumstances desirable or essential; as regards Mr. Butler's unanswered letter X have noted the views expressed in/in paragraph 6 of Mr. Chamberlain's letter to the Admiralty, PZ 6 i 3 l&lt;.. dated the 15th September, 1937, of which a copy was sent to * * /jg me under cover of your despatch No. 376 of the' 7th October, 1937, (E 5787/111/34). Pending further instructions, I do not propose to press the Ministry of Foreign Affairs further on any of the above matters. 5. Another minor point raised in the correspondence with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on this subject to which the note makes no reference, is the provision of the further information regarding the Iranian lights at Bushire and Oais Island, ?/hich was requested in a memorandum from His Majesty 1 s Legation of the 17th December, 1937, a copy of which was enclosed in the letter from my Chancery to the Political Residency No. 560/9/37 of the same date (please see my despatch to you No. 467 of the 17th December, 1937). A further attempt will be made to obtain the details required from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, to His Majesty f s .Ambassador in Bagdad, and to His Majesty’s consular officer in Bushire. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) H.J. Seymour.Translation of note-verbale from the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (3rd Political Department) to His Majesty 1 s Legation, Tehran. No. 41759/3915 of the 9th Bahman 1316 (29th January, 1938). Memorandum. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Imperial Government, in reply to the aide-memoire of the 29th Shahrivar (20th September 1937) and the memorandum No. 617 of the 26th Azer 1316 (17th December 1937) of His Majesty^ Legation concerning light houses and lights in the Persian Gulf and also with reference to Mr. Butler* s letter No.176/25/37 of the 4th Aban (26th October 1937) addressed to His Excellency Mohsen Rais and to verbal discussions which were held previously on the subject, have the honour to state that according to information received from the competent quarters, instructions have been issued that whenever a new light or buoy is installed a warning notice should be issued beforehand in order to prevent any danger to navigation; that until new lights or buoys are completely ready no steps will be taken for the removal of the former lights or buoys; all warnings and notices will be prepared by the naval force of the South and will be given by the said Force to the representatives of the shipping companies and to the Basra Port Department; and particulars will, at the same time, be communicated to the Legations concerned through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, together with the necessary copies of the notices. As regards the light-house at Kish, according to information received from the competent quarters, the maker’s representative who was mounting the light lighted it in order to test it and make ready for delivery, but later was immediately stopped in order to prevent any danger or mistakes arising# (Seal)(204/4/38). 10th February, 1938. My dear Friend, In the course of our conversation on the 8th February we agreed that it would he useful that I should put on paper the points that I mentioned to you arising out of the Ministry’s Memorandum of the 29th January (No* 41759/3915) on the taking over by the Iranian authorities of certain lights and buoys in the Persian Gulf* 2* I told you that His Majesty’s Legation had noted with appreciation that the Southern Naval Forces intended to arrange that a warning notice should be given prior to the entry into service of each new light or buoy. In this connexion I reminded you of paragraph 3 of our Note No. 617 of the 17th December, suggesting that information regarding the height above high water , and also the candle-power as seen from the sea of any new lighthouse should be included in the notice to mariners. You referred to the notification given as regards the Qais Light, of which you were kind enough to give us a copy in a memorandum, dated the 1st December, 1937, I have looked again at this and see that the height is given, but that there is no reference to high or low water, and that the candle-power is not stated. It would be a convenience to shipping if these were specified in the notifications* 3* I expressed the hope too that, among the recipients of the advance notices of new installations, Southern Naval Gommand would be kind enough to include H Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr, especially as the copy promised to His Majesty’s Legation can hardly arrive very early* The notice about the Qais light dated the November reached the Legation on the 4th December, whereas njani, we/ Ministry of Foreign Affairs, T ehran.we are anxious that the shipping and officials interested should receive a clear month's notice if this is possible* 4. The Ministry memorandum of the 29th January under reference did not allude to a suggestion made at the end of the communication that my Minister left with His Excellency M* Adi on the 29th November, to the effect that qualified experts should meet to settle locally in advance any technical questions that may possibly arise. I drew your attention to one such, namely a passage in the Ministry's memorandum which reads rather as if the Iranian authorities would in due course remove the existing lights and buoys when they are no longer required; whereas this work is really the responsibility of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. Also, Sir J.Ward is a man with many responsibilities, and I expressed the hope that he would be given notice well in advance before the removal of a light or buoy is desired. 5. As I said in our talk. His Majesty's Legation have no doubt that the Commander of the Southern Naval Forces has most of these points, perhaps all of them, in mind. At your suggestion I have committed them to paper, my Minister would of course appreciate it if the Ministry could inform him that regard will be taken of them. (Sgd. ) N. Butler*NO. 131.

You w r ill remember that at the meeting at this Office on the 7th October 1935 (of which the minutes were sent to Baylett on the 15th Octoher Ho. P. Z. 7234/35j the Board of Trade representatives agreed that proposal (1) in the Conclusions should he put to the Government of Ind^a on the understanding that the latter would consult the Advisory Committee at Bombay.

Guttery, Esq. , Mercantile Marine Department, Board of Trade, S.W. 1.2 . 1956 (of which a copy was sent to the Board of Trade on the 13th January No. P.Z. 231/36), replied that while the Advisory Committee were of opinion that if the Kais lightship is maintained in its present position no light on Stiffe Bank is needed, they (the Government of India) agreed with the conclusion that a light should he placed on the Stiffe Bank 'by the readjustments proposed in the Conclusions of the India Office meeting. 3. It appears from Sir John Ward’s letter of the 20th September that nothing more has happened - possibly the Government of India may have been waiting for a further move from this end - but in view of the prospect of a Persian lighthouse replacing the Kais Island light ship in the near future and of the troubles that have already arisen in connection with its irregular and unnotified testing, it seems desirable that the Government of India should now be urged to consider the question of making the suggested adjustments forthwith. 4.

Bear Sir John, We have had a letter from the Foreign Office about the eorjaunication that has been received from the Persian Government sowing that they do not, after all, want to buy the lights and buoys on the Persian side of the Gulf from the Government of India but that they are going to make their own arrangements* The Foreign Office have suggested that if we want to consult you on the technical and administrative aspects of the question we should write to you direct. You will remember that we had a meeting at the India Office in October, 1935, about the desirability of maintaining a complete chain of reliable route lights under our own control with particular reference to the possibility that a Persian controlled lighthouse on Qals Island might prove ultimately unreliable. It was accordingly suggested that in order to forestall the Persian Government in lighting the Stiffs Bank, pending the release of the ; .]ais Island light vessel, a lighted buoy should be substituted for the Bahrein light vessel which should be established at Stiff© Bank. it nel Sir John Ward, MCE.,C.M.G.,C*I*E* , B.S.Q. , Tanooma, Beal*was further suggested that when the Qais Island light vessel became available it should be brought up to the &gt; ii_.f,-i4 Shatt-el-Arab and the Shatt-el-Arab lighthouse either to K replace the buoy at Bahrein or to replace the Balirein light vessel at Stiffe Bank so that it would again be available at Bahrein* These suggestions were put to the Government of India who in January, 1936, agreed that they should be adopted* We have, I think, heard no more about it and I presume that no action has yet been taken for any such readjustments* Perhaps you would kindly oonfim this* ie should also be very glad to know what your present views are about the desirability of making some such changes as were suggested in 1935* Presumably we cannot be sure that the Hothouse which the Persians are puttin * up on Qais Island will be efficient, and if it is, in fact, likely to prove necessary in the long run for the Persian Gulf lighting service to establish reliable route lights in the neighbourhood it may be desirable to do it as soon as possible, particularly as the Persian Government at one time showed some disposition to place a light vessel themselves on the Stiffe Bank*We shall, of coarse, be consulting the Government of India on the general question in the light of the new eonxnunicati on fro® the Persian G-overnment and in doing so it might save time and trouble if we could let them have any views which you may feel disposed to offer at the present stage, particularly on the points I have mentioned.

Immediate. 15th September, 1937 /ft Sir I am directed by Mr. Neville Chamberlain to invite a reierence to Foreign Office letter n 5190/111/34 of the 4th September, enclosing copies of two telegrams from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, reporting the decision of the Persian Government henceforth to undertake sole responsibility for the necessary lighting and buoying installations in Persian territorial waters in the Persian Gulf and their request that the necessary steps may be taken for the removal from those waters of the lights and buoys belonging to the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. 2. Although the present decision of the Persian Government takes no account of the protracted negotiations for the conclusion of a Protocol whereby they would have taken over the lights and buoys of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service, and empowered the Persian Gulf Lighting Service to act as their agents, at any rate for a time, for the maintenance of those lights and buoys, Mr. Chamberlain is satisfied that the Government of India have in the main no choice but to accept this3. Tne lights a ad buoys which the Persian Government desire to see removed are presumably those enumerated in d-ninex I co the araft protocol enclosed in Foreign Oifice despa tcii to Tehran No.50 of the 2nd February, 1937 copies of which were sent to the India Office under cover of Foreign Office letter 7733/159/34 of the 4th February. ^• Of these lights and buoys the only one which serves to mark the main shipping route through the Persian Gulf is presumably the light-ship off yais island. The eventual disposal of this light-ship will no doubt depend on whether or not the new light which the Persian Government have apparently already installed on Qais island will be suiticiently powerful to render unnecessary a light in the neighbourhood of the island (but outside its territorial waters) or on Stiffe Bank. This is a technical question with which the Foreign Office are not immediately concerned, and the only point which Mr. Chamberlain wishes to make is that however this question may be answered, it should, in his opinion, be answered in such a manner as to leave the main shipping route independent of Persian co-operation, or at any rate of Persian favours. If, for example, the new light on Qais island seems likely to prove an adequate substitute for the existing light-ship, it may be possible to dispense with any other light near the island or on Stiffs Bank for so long as the new light functions properly. But should this light for any reason cease to function properly, he would be reluctant to contemplate making any representations to the Persian Government on the subject. The proper remedy in such a case would, he considers, be for the Government/✓ / Government of India themselves to provide in the area such lights as would he necessary for the proper navigation of, the main route up the Persian Gulf. In this connexion it must he remembered that if no light is placed now on Stiffe Bank by the Government of India a light may be placed there by the Persian Government. 5. Of the remaining material Mr. Chamberlain understands that it could all he removed fairly easily^ and either utilised elsewhere or placed in reserve, with the exception of the bases of the flashing-light at Henjam and the light-house at Jask and of the beacon at Jask, none of which are presumably of substantial value. 6 . As regards the three points referred to in paragraph 4 of Mr. Seymour’s telegram ho.119, on which the Persian Government have been asked to give assurances, it is possible, as Mr. Seymour suggests, that the promised Persian reply to Mr. Butler's letter to M.Ansarie of the 13th March (see Foreign Office letter b 1739/11/34 of the 13th April) may contain some responsive observations. Mr. Chamberlain feels sure, however, that there is little likelihood now of persuading the Persian Government to agree to an exchange of notes containing assurances eicher about consultation with shipowners or the scale of dues. As regards the scale of dues, Mr. Chamberlain feels that it will be necessary to rely for the present on the assurance contained in M.Motamedy’s letter to Mr..cutler of the 20th June, 1935 (see Foreign Office letter B 4382/159/34 of the 1st August, 1936), with at the most an acknowledgement on the lines suggested in Foreign Office despatch ho,50 to Tehran of the 2 nd Feoruary and to have recourse to diplomatic representations in the event of/Iof the Persian Government charging dues at an excessive rate. These dues will no doubt be levied at Abadan in respect of the dais island light and any other route lights which the Persian Government may hereafter establish, and at the individual ports in respect of the lights and buoys at those ports, and if the recent Perso-Iraqi frontier treaty comes into force no international questions should arise by reason of the levy of such dues at Abadan. As regards the dues to be pc'id by Admiralty tankers enjoying the benefit of the lights and buoys, it may be necessary to pursue this question further w .th the Persian Government on the lines indicated in Mr. Butler’s letter to M.Ansarie of the 13th March, although it may equally be better tactics to wait until the Persian Government not only begin to levy dues but attempt to levy them on Admiralty oilers at some unacceptable rate or in some unacceptable manner. These, however, are all matters which can be more fully considered when the written Persian rep3.y is received. 7. It has been possible to discuss the situation informally in the Foreign Office v r ith Colonel Sir John ward, who will be in this country until about the 27th September and whose address is Tanooma, Beal, dir John oard is not likely to be in London before his departure except on Tuesday, the 21st September and should one Inuia Office desire to consult him on the technical and administrative aspects of this question, it is suggested that a direct communication should be sent to him at that address. 8 . As regards the reply to be made to the Persian Government’s present communication, nr.Chamberlain suggests, subject to the concurrence of the marquess of Zetland that Mr. Seymour should be instructed to iniorm Ghe Persian/Persian Government orally .that the Government of India regret a decision which means that the time and trouble alreaoy taken in working out a scheme to meet that Government’s own request will be wasted, but are prepared co remove tne lights and buoys in question v/hen tne new installations are in place and ready to function, and when adequaue no bice 01 the impending changes has been given to shipping, Mr. Chamberlain would, moreover, propose to authorize Mr. Seymour to put forward the suggestion mentioned in paragraph 4 of his telegram No.119 that outstanding points regarding the removal of the present lights and the substitution of a service administered by the Persian Government might most satisfactorily be settled by qualified experts from both sides meeting for the purpose. 9.

The question arises out of the establishment by the Iranian Government ,T for testing purposes” of a flashing light at Kais Island which is only worked at irregular intervals; as you will see that the Company also advise that a light has been installed at Bushire which also, as appears from a subsequent navigational warning issued by that Government, operates at irregular intervals.

We have just received advice that apparently as from 1st August a light has been observed flashing on Kais Island, the flash apparently being every 5 seconds compared with the flash of the existing light vessel off Kais Island of one flash every 10 seconds. Enquiries of the Iranian Naval Commandant at Khorramshahr elicited that this new light house has been installed by the Iranian Authorities and is only working at irregular intervals for a short period for testing purposes. We were also advised that a light nas also been installed d Bushire. Upon obtaining this information we understand the Port Authority at Basrah, which operates the Persian naif nights on behalf of the Indian Government and for some time past the Iranian Government issued a navigational warning as xollows.

He reminded me that Mejliso haa recently approved accession of Iran to an Internationa agreement regarding a uniform system of marine lighting. 1 said that I would inform Governments of India and the United Kingdom of the Iranian Government's decision not to con clude draft protocol and would inform them also that a reply giving particulars of Iranian Government’s proposal would be communicated to us 6 I again emphasised the importance of not making changes without proper notice to all concerned and pointed out the disturbance to shipping, costs of freight and insurance which might be caused* I also verified that the phrase quoted above about removing material belonging to Persian Gulf Lighting Service was loosely used and that the Iranian Government were talking about lighting of their own coasts and waters and. of nothing else.

I transmitted to rt^r Government a copy of monsieur ; otamedy *s letter together with some further explanations which he gave to dr. Loxley in conversation on the same date as Me letter on the six points enumerated in it. His Majesty’s Minister has now received the views on His Majesty*® Government on these point® and hm mked me to convey them to you. 2. As regards Point 1 in Monsieur otamedy*® letter* Hie Majesty ’» Government do not wish to press for the revised Preamble referred to. They are- willing to accept that originally put forward by the Iranian Oovemmani in a draft Protocol which was sent to this Legation under cover o.f a letter from Monsieur potamedy dated iugu. t 24th 183b (let Ohahrivar I3i4)* three textual amendments however Bern required.

B »t quite aeeur.tely given. iss'i will find at the beginning of a further revised draft Protocol enclosed herein the original Iranian preamble amended to meet the above three points. regards rolnt 2 1 Bis Majesty’s Oovernumnt have carefully considered the vie% of the Iranian 0overnment that the option to terminate earlier the proposed $ years arrangement as regards (a) the maintenance of the tight® and Buoy®, (b) the lea»e of ..ais lightship, m&amp; (c) the mintanance of this lightship t should rest with the Imperial Government only and not with the Government of India also. His ia^esty 1 ® Government are willing to accept the Imperial Government’s point of view. This involves certain drafting alteration® in articles 8(1} , 5(i) and 5(i) of the draft Protocol communicated to monsieur ^oiamedy in my letter of March 18th (2?th isfand 1334). Also seeing that there would be obvious objection to arrangement (e) above being terminated apart from (b), paragraphs (i) and (11) of Article 6 require modification® to provide for the termination of (c) only if (b) ceases to be operative. You will find all the required alterations made in the revised draft now enclosed. 4. The above two points refer to the draft protocol hitherto drafted in .french. as I explained to none tear Motesuedy at the end of my letter of March iSth ( 87 th Kef and,, it i. not the praetiee of my Government to sign agreement, of this kind drawn ap in French. It will therefore evontoally be necessary to trajialute the whole of the fl na l t,.xi Protocol into Snglleh and no doubt into Feral m *lm&gt;, for signature. 5. Point 4 in Monsieur ^otaasdy 1 ® letter refers paragraphs 3 to 6 of the second Explanatory *° te an Kxehange of Kota.) which I comrrunicated to him with my letterof March 18th (87th Karan*). The* P «r agPaph8 give the reaaona for the keen desire of the Government of mau that amr trm transfer of the i*t«fit* gM ha® taken, place f the Iranian authorities should continue to consult the committee of interested ship-owner® whom Qolonel f**a ^ h ^n in the hahit of consulting- through the Chairman of the Lighting Committee in Bombay in the regard to the lighting service in the 1'ersia.n and Ostan Sulffep both a® to the location of lights and as to the question of dues. UU Majesty 1 ® Government expreaeed the hop© that the imperial Govemment would be willing to exchange note® indicating their readiness to give sympathetic consideration to the views of these shipowners. 6* His Majesty 1 ® ^over?wnt now welcome the statement in .lanaieur mt&amp;m&amp;y * s letter that every useful suggestion coming from Mimm® shipowners will be attentively examined. They still hope« however» that the Imperial Government will agree to embody this expression of their intention in an exchange of notes. 7. Point b concerns filers in the service of the British Admiralty* the existing practice and the attitude of Hi® Majesty’s Government are explained in paragraphs S to 10 of my letter to Monsieur Jo tarn© dy of larch iBth (yTth island) At present no dues are levied on these oilers?* but a sum equivalent to what would have been paid by ordinary shipping is paid over by the Admiralty to the Government of India. The Admiralty offered, after the Lights and Buoy a Have been transferred, to make? similar to the Imperial Government based on the volume of Blue Ensign tonnage (i.e. vessels Admiralty-owned ami on Admiralty service&gt; enjoying the benefit of the Lights ami Buoys at *h© rut* three pie® per registered ton, on the understanding tsia higher rate would not be charged subsequently. 8./8. Momsieur .iofmedy's letter of .-une soth (aoth Khordad 1318} stated in reply that the eoale of fees whioh may be levied on uiler* belonging to Hie -^jetty's (Jovernment win net be greater than the dues ordinarily levied on other ships. 9 . Hie Majesty’s Government have given careful consideration to this indication of the Imperial Government's attitude. They do not recognise that m a natter of internetionssti Xaw y any ri ht exists to ooliect cfuesj such a® those now in question from froverntjent Oiler©. The British Admiralty have, however, no wish to adopt an unreasonable attitude, and it was for this reason that their offer of a Itt&amp;sfi sum payment was made, die Majesty** Oovern'ient now renew this offer. As regards any possible future changes In the rate of payment the Admiralty realise that revision either up or down may In the future be justifiable and they suggest that it should, be left that either party may raise the question of a possible revision of the rate at any time. for their part His Majesty f s Government would always be prepared to give full consideration to any reasonable case put forward| it being understood, however, that this agreement does not necessarily imply that the same rate will be paid by Admiralty oil ere as by ordinary commercial ©hipping but that a different rate may, il appropriate, be agreed between the parties. 10 . I should explain further that His Majesty*8 Government contemplate that the payment will be made annually on the basis of the Blue Ensign shipping In question which used the ahait-el-Arab during the preceding year. ?ne present arrangement is that the Government of India tender a statement in February of each year showing the names of Admiralty tankers »aieh entered anti left the Shatt-el-Arab during the twelve months from the 1st i&lt;oveahei to the October/ y 4October (10th Abenmah to 9th Abanmah) preo.ning, together ,nh the relevant dates and a statement In each case of the net registered tonnage and the amount of the light due# to be paid. It would be convenient If « similar statement of account for each period of twelve months from the let April to the $ U t aarch (12th Farvardin to nth Farvardln) Inclusire could be rendered each year by the Iranian Oovernment a# soon as possible after the letter d&amp;te. Mm raje^ty *% Oovernnent nl nee rely hope that their revised offer and the arrangements as explained in the two preceding paragraphs will be acceptable to the Imperial Government. The offer U reciprocal in the sense that in Great Britain Government ships, whether belonging to British or Foreign Government# have t unless carrying cargo or passengers for freight of fares, been exempted since i9l9 (Order in Council of July 30th 19.19) from the payment of dues in respect of lighting. And more recently under Articles 9 and 10, and paragraph 6 of Annex 2 to the Momtreux Convention of July 20th 193$ (29th fir 1313), naval auxiliary vessels, including such Admiralty tankers, are exempted from the payment of any dues or chargee whatever. 12* As regards Point 6 in monsieur Motamedy*8 letter, it was suggested in the first three paragraphs of the second Explanatory Hot© which accompanied my letter of Aaroh 18th (27th its fund) that the signature of the Protocol transferring the .'Lights and Buoys to the Imperial Government should be accompanied by an Sxchange of notes embodying the Assurance given on behalf of the Imperial Ministry of Finance during the discussions of April 16 th to April 20th v-j'SS (26th to 30th Farvardine 1314) that duos would not be levied on international shipping at a rate greater than is necessary to cover the coot# of operating the light* in question and the amortisation of/of the capitml invested. 13. Monsieur mtmrn&amp;y'* letter stated in reply th^t m tne fixing of dues fall vithin the eompetenca of each State, no fon^nl obligation could be undertaken, but that the policy of the Imperial Government remained m declared, namely that the seals e S dues would be related to the cost of adiitlnistering the bights and In any ease would not be regarded by the Imperial Government as a source of revenue. 14. His Majesty*£ Government recognise that this matter is within the competence of the at&amp;te concerned, nevertheless it would be by no means without precedent to give a formal undertaking of the kind suggested. A similar undertaking as regards dues figures for example in article 3 of the Statute of Freedom of transit of I9Ei f of which the Imperial Government, like Hie Majesty’s Government, are signatories. The principle that dues should not exceed the costs in respect of which they are levied is to be found also in paragraph 4 of \imex 1 of the recent ontreux Convention regarding the dagtsie of the Straits. - is •ajesty * Government arc aware that the Imperial Government have demonstrated in the course of their present negotiations *Uh the Government of Iraq a® 'regards the Sh&amp;it~ei-4rah, t..ieir attachment to the shove principle. pevertheles* Ule ‘njeety*8 Sovemment believe that, a* at yontreux, it v,&gt;uj.d be of peal utility to place on record this sound principle, and they suggefit the met nod of an exchange of ntte concurrently with the signature of the protocol transferring the Lights and Buoys to the Iranian Government. 18. 3y virtue of this Protocol the imperial Government will receive considerable benefits from foe .ovemme India./India* His Majesty 1 s Government feel that -‘hey can reasonably hope that the Imperial Covernment on their side sill be ready to facilitate the introduction of the ne* system by placing on record the assurances they have already given with regard, to this question of the relation of dues to expenses and the .question of consultation with the shipping interests concerned, i®* y° u would care to discus© orally any of the questions raised in this letter, either Hr.

Butler's despatch Ho.327 of the 26th June 1936 (71/20/36) on the subject of the transfer to the Persian Government of certain lights and buoys in the Persian Gulf, I now transmit to you a revised draft Protocol together rith a note explaining the alterations v.hich have been made in the text as a result of M. Motamedy's letter of 20th June to Mr. Butler and of his subsequent conversation with Mr. Loxley and. ox further observations by the Government of India. These points, and the rest of the six points raised in M. i'Jotamedy’ s letter, are also dealt with below. 2 * P oint 1 . Omission of full preamble . His Majesty’s Governi.lent are prepared to adopt the Form of preamble originally put Forward by the Persian Government. its text needs, however, to be amended in certain particulars. For instance, the correct French translation oF 'Government oF India' is '’Le Gouvernement de I’Inde', and the phrase 'il a ete convenu u ce qui suit' is exceedingly clumsy. In this latter connexion it would be preFerable to substitute the words 'ont ’’convenu de ce qui suit' aFter deleting this word 'Entre' in the First line. But since the protocol, although negotiated in French For the sake oF convenience, will be signed in English, or in English and Persian, these need not be regarded as major points. A more important question is the use oF the phrase u 8 a Majeste Britannique'. This phrase should iF possible be avoided and you will observe that His Majesty’s correct title has been substituted provisionally in the draFt protocol. Majesty’s Seymour, Esq., C..M. G. , C.V.,0. , et c., etc., etc., Tehran.Majesty’s Government are nrem-ppa k prepared, however, as an exceptional case, o accept '- S a Majeste Britannique' (or rather 'Hi s 'Britannic Majesty'), should the adoption of any alternative rendering for any reason prove a source of difficulty. 3.

T hie suggestion can oe accepted without qualification with regard to (a) and (b), but m view of the objections which exist to the termination of (c without the termination of (b), Article 5 has been redrafted so as to provide for the termination of (c) only in the event of (b) ceasing to be operative. 4.- I shall be glad if you will now endeavour to reach final agreement with the Persian Government upon the text of this Protocol, with a view to its early signature. Point 5. The lighting of Stiffe Bank. There is no need to mention this point further, as the Persian Government have now been duly informed of the Government of India’s intentions and further representations might merely be a source of irritation to them. It can no doubt be discussed later by Colonel Ward and Colonel Bayendor. 6* Point 4 . Consultation v/ith shipowners . The statement contained in M. Motamedy’s letter, which is satisfactory as far as it goes, seems to be all that His Majesty’s Government are likely to obtain in the way of an assurance on this point. I gather, however, from the record of Mr. Loxley’ s conversation with M. Motamedy enclosed in Mr. Butler’s despatch that the possibility of the Persian Government repeating this statement in an official exchange of notes is not absolutely excluded, and it may be worth while asking • • •asking whether they are willing tn rtn ,, nl . . . . S0 - Should they prove unwilling, it will he necessary *. necessary to rest content with M Motamedy's statement. in that „ in that case, however, I consider, sub jGct to your observations tvi + erVf.tions, that you should take a suitable opportunity at or about the tino r-r-u^^ _ be time when the Protocol is signed of placing it on record, in writinrr +&gt; 10 + +-u • m writing that this statement has been noted. This should, so far as no-ible a ° P°^ible, be done in such a way as to avoid giving the impression that the communication in question is an acknowledgement of M. Motamedy’s letter as a whole, since there are points in that letter which His Majesty’s Government clearly cannot accept, even though they may not wish to embark upon any argument regarding them. I ma y add that it is- immaterial whether this point and the more important point about dues (see paragraph 11 below) are dealt with in the same exchange of notes; or alternatively in the same letter, or are dealt with separately. Point—5. Contribution to lighting and b uoying expenses by A dmiralty oilers . In this connexion I would draw your attention to the observations under this heading contained in Foreign Office letter E 4832/159/34 of 1st August 1936 to the Admiralty (of which a copy was enclosed in my despatch No.321 of the 4th August). I have since received the reply of the Admiralty, who adhere to their view that the levy of light dues on Blue Ensign oilers is inconsistent with customary international courtesy, and consider that so long as the whole of the Shatt-el-Arab opposite Abadan remains Iraqi waters the only power which the Persian authorities would possess for the enforcement of the payment of any dues which they may decide to levy would be to withhold the supply of oil. The Admiralty are, however, anxious firstly to avoid any conflict with the Persian authorities which might lead them to interrupt the supply of oil, and secondly to keep the dues at the lowest possible level. They therefore suggest that on this point thethe reply to the Perqinn ^ erslan Government should be lines: the following jco by o u-overnment that as a matter o f International law the Persian Oovernment Admiralty have no wish to adopt an unreasonable attitude, 'and it was for this reason that their offer of a lump 'sum payment was made. As regards any possible 'changes in the rate of payment, the Admiralty realise 'that revision either up or down may in the future be 'justifiable, and they suggest that it should be left that either party may raise the question of a possible 'revision of the rate at any time. por their part the Admiralty would always be prepared to give full 'consideration to any reasonable case put forward; it 'being understood, however, that this agreement does not necessarily imply that the same rate will he paid by Admiralty oilers as oy ordinary commercial shipping but ,f that a different rate may, if appropriate, be agreed ’’between the parties.” The Admiralty express the view that if the Persian Government were to accept t ^is arrangement it would be clear that the Admiralty liability depended upon contract, and that therefore the rate, of payment could not be raised without their consent. 8 . They also suggest that it would be advisable to make it clear to the Persian Government that the payment will be made annually on the basis of the Blue Ensign Shipping which used the Shatt-el-Arab during the preceding year. Such an arrangement for payment would tend to minimise the risk that an individual ship might be held up in order to secure the Payment 'from the Master of dues at an increased rate. The present arrangement is that the Government of India render a statement in February of each year showing the names of the Admiralty ...Admiralty tankers whi ch entered and left the Shatt-el-Arah during the twelve months from the 1st November to the 3i s t October preceding, together with the relevant dates and a statement in each case of the net registered tonnage and the amount of the light dues to he naid it w pa a. it would he convenient if a similar statement of aer'mTn’f t, oi account for each period of twelve months from the 1st April to the 31st March inclusive could be rendered each year by the Persian Government as soon as possible after the latter date. 9 * In additi on the Board of Trade draw attention to the fact that (a) in this country Government ships, when not carrying cargo or passengers for freight or fare, are hy virtue of section 5 (2) of the Merchant Shipping (Mercantile Marine Fund) Act, 1898, and the Order in Council of J^th July, 1919, exempt from the payment of light dues, and that (h) under Articles 9 and 10 of paragraph 6 of Annex 2 to the Montreux Convention of 20th July, 1936, naval auxiliary vessels, which would include Admiralty tankers if normally employed on fleet duties, are exempt from the payment of dues. Copies of the documents referred to hy the Board of Trade are enclosed. 10 . I shall he glad if you will, if you see no objection, take an early opportunity of discussing this question further with the Persian Government on the lines suggested hy the Admiralty, making use at your discretion and in such manner as you think best, of the observations of the Board of Trade, and of conveying to them the information contained in paragraph 8 above. If however you consider that it would he preferable to make the communication suggested hy the Admiral t , r in the form of a simple statement of the Admiralty’s intentions, without pressing for an explicit acceptance, you should xefer to me for further instructions. 11 * • • •1U ^U£ances_aW_dues. ^ Tae little likelihood that d ■ mS t0 that the Per slan Government will moaifv their present attitude on thio on this question, hut i shall be if you will, unless you see strong obiectinn , ^ b OD3eotlon » make one further effort m such manner as you think best to oest to secure from the Peroian Government m the_form of an exchange of notes some confimation of tt. aaao r a„ 0 aa a , y ta v= glv , n .

Should the Persian Government he unwilling to modify their present attitude, I consider, subject to your observations, that you should take a suitable opportunity at or about the time when the protocol is signed of placing it on record in writing that their earlier statements have been noted. This communication might state that the substance of paragraph (g) of the draft heads of agreement drawn up after the discussions of 6 th and 20th April, 1935, as well as paragraph 6 of M. Motamedy's letter of 20th June, 1936, to Mr. Loxley, have been brought to the notice of His Majesty^s Government and the Government of India, who have noted with satisfaction that dues not be levied on international shipping at a greater rate than • • •than is necessary to cover the cost of the service • . tne services involved, and will m any case not be regardpri regarded by the Persian Qovernment a^ a sounce of nevenue. 13.

Motamedy (i. e . that it is hopeless to press for a formal exchange of notes). On the other hand the Admiralty letter of the 42nd September, (a copy of which was sent to the Government of India on 24th September*) suggests that another shot should be made at the Persians on the matter. A further consideration is that when the file was last submitted to the Deputy Under Secretary of State (P.2. 583/36) a rather definite line was taken ('it is essential to validate this assurance, if possible, by a formal exchange of notes.') and approved. In these circumstances, it may be best to agree with the Foreign Office that M. Motamedy 1 s assurances may be accepted as sufficient, but to link this agreement with a hope that another shot will first be made at an exchange of notes if H.M.Minister thinks it would be my good. Apart from this, the only difficulty which now ixists is in regard to point 2. The Government of 'ndia’s telegram seems to overlook the fact that in .rticle 2(1) of the draft protocol Col. Ward is .escribed, not as Port Director at Basra, but as director of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. Therefore hen 'Col. Ward or his successors' appears later in the rotocol, it should mean his successors, not as Port irector, but as Director of the Gulf lights. I have iscussed with the Eastern Department (Mr. Lambert) and ,2. we agree that it might be best to leave out mention of Col.

Phis mi^fat be anyone, e.g. the Flag Offic®** Commanding the Royal Indian Navy or the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, whom the Government of India might so appoint m the event of CoL Ward ceasing to be Director. The other points raise no difficulties for us. The attached draft letter to the Foreign Office is accordingly submitted.

A copy of the Exp? ess LS Letter to which the telegram replies was forwarded to the Foreign Office on the 31st August. In the light of his consultation with the Government of India, the Marquess of Zetland has the following remarks to make. (1) He has no objection to the omission of the preamble to the draft Protocol. (2) He appreciates the Government of India f s anxiety not to guarantee the continued employment of the Basra Port Director in the administration of the Persian Gulf Lights. But it appears to him that their object could be achieved t■by the omission of Colonel Ward's name from Article 2(1) of the draft -Protocol, the substitutionfbr his name, wherever else it appears, of the title ”le Directeur du Persian Gulf Lighting Service”, and by , the omission, both in Article 2(1) and elsewhere, of the phrase ses successeurs”• Unless the Government of India (to whom a copy of this letter is beingsent) take any exception, this solution might be suggested by H.M.

(4) He agrees that the assurance in M.Motamedy’s letter regarding consultation with shipowners may be accepted. Should however the Persian Government consent to exchange notes regarding light dues (see ( 6 ) below), they wouldno doubt be prepared to include an assurance on this point. (5) He has no observations to make regarding a contribution in respect of Admiralty tankers. (6) He fears that Mr. Eden is probably right in thinking that it will be necessary to accept the assurance in regard to light dues given in M.Motamedy’s letter, but he would welcome a further attempt, as suggested in Admiralty J letter/5036 5000 7.36 )raft Paper.

There is also a certain advantage in encouraging the Persians to prolong the interim arrangements us long as possible. The duestion seems, however, to be primarily one for the Government of India. If they do not wish to be bound for the full term of five years, the solution might be to provide for termination of any of these items at any time by the .Persians and at any time after, say, 3 years by the Government of India on, say# £ months notice. £• .;..i,qit on ...i tlffe dank.

Uy Lords adliere to their view that the levy of light dues on the Blue Ensign Oilers is inconsistent with customary international courtesy. regards the question whether the lersians will In fact have any power to levy the dues upon Admiralty oilers, it appears to their Lordships that ©o long as the whole of the 3 hatt~©l-Arab opposite Abadan remain© Iraqi, the Persians would have no right to levy dues upon shipping lying alongside, since it would not come within their Jurisdiction. In these circumstances it would seem that the only power which the Persian authorities would possess for the enforcement of payment of the dues would be to withhold the supply of oil. My Lords are, however, anxious, firstly to avoid any conflict with the Persian authorities which might lead them to interrupt the supply of oil, and secondly ^eep the dues at the lowest level possible. they therefore suggest that on this point the reply to the Persian Government should be as follows h.m. Government do not recognise that as a matter of the right Admiralty attitude, of a lump international la* the Persian Uo.ernment have to collect the dues from oilers, oat me have no wish to aaopt an unreasonable and it was for this reason- sum payment was made# that their offer regards any possible futurefuture changes in the rate of payment, the admiralty realise that revision either up or down may ln the future he Justifiable, a „ d the y suggeat that u ^ be left that either party may raise the question of a possible revision of the rate at any time. For their part the Admiralty would always be prepared to give full consideration to any reasonable case put forward; it being understood, however, that this agreement does not necessarily imply that the same rate will he paid by Admiralty oilers as by ordinary commercial shipping but that a different rate may, if appropriate, be agreed between the parties. (In this connection see the second complete paragraph on page 7 of report of Mr. Lesley's interview with M. Motamedy on 80th June). If the Persians accepted this arrangement it would be clear that the Admiralty liability depended upon contract, and that, therefore, the rate of payment could not be raised without their consent. My Lords also suggest that it would be advisable to make it clear to the Persian Government that the payment will be made annually on the basis of the Blue insign Shipping which used the Shatt-el-Arab during the preceding year. Such an arrangement for payment would tend to minimise the risk that an individual ship would be held up in order to secure the payment from the Master of dues at an increased rate. me present arrangement is that the Government of India render a statement in February of each year showing the names of the Admiralty tankers which entered and left the Shatt-el-^rab during toe 12 raontos from toe let Hovember to toe -Ist, October preceding, together with toe relevant dates and a statement in each case of the net registered tonnage and the amount of to light «••••»•light dues to he paid. it u woala be convenient if a simUar statement of account for each neriod to eriod 12 months from the L« April to to. ai„ in. lu .U. „ ala i. reMtl , ia b» to.

My nords consider that a Partner endeavour should be made to ftaem** «« ‘ secure an assurance in an exchange of notes. My Lords suggest that a reply might be made to the effect that it is not without precedent for states to give a formal undertaking of this kind, and reference might be made to the undertaking regarding dues in article 3 of the statute of Freedom of Transit of 1921, which the Persian Government have themselves accepted. It might also be pointed out that they will receive under the protocol considerable benefits at the hand of the Government of India and it is only reasonable to expect that they will not make the position of the Government of India, vis a vis the Indian ship owners, difficult by refusing a formal assurance on this point.

I agree with you that a lighted buoy is psychol ogically a different thing to a light vessel, and that it would not matter much at what stage of Iranian activity at Qais we were to place a buoy at Farur Shoal. I am not even absolutely convinced that, even if we were to place one there after the Iranians had begun to operate a light house on Qais, the Iranians would inevitably leap to the conclusion that our action was dictated by lack ol trust in their own efficiency. Prom conversations with Bayendor I have formed the impression that he favours a multitude ox lights - doubtless the less good a seamen you are, the “nore lights you like to have, and I think it might be possible t explain to him guite tactfully that, despite his magnificent lighthouse at Qeis, we think it would he a .o^d plan a buoy at Parur Shoal as well.

With regard to the six points raised by the Persian Government, I am to offer the following preliminary observations;- (1) (Omission of the preamble). There appears to be no objection to this omission, if the Persian Government prefer it. The objections of the latter are presumably mainly concerned with the words ’’desireux de part et d’ autre d’assurer la reglementation du service de certains feux, bouees et balises dans le golfe Persique et le golfe d’Oman 1 ', but they may also dislike the mention of ’'Plenipotentiaries’/ and in any case they may naturally feel a preference for their own original drafting* It is not essential that it should be stated that the representatives signing the instrument are ,, Plenipotentiaries ,, for the proposed protocol in the main deals with matters of routine administration, regulates no matter of principle, and imposes obligations rather than ter-Secretary of State, India Office.

It is to be presumed that the Government of India will have no objection to retaining the actual management of the lights and buoys in their own hands for so long as the Persian Government will let them do so e If so, they may see no great objection to committing themselves to doing so for five years. Similarly, it is possible that the Government of of India would be willing (were the leasing^the light-vessel to the Persian Government not in question at all) to keep the lights vessel stationed at Qais island for so long as no alternative light existed. If so, they may see no great objection to undertaking the obligation to do so for five years. So long, again, as the light-vessel remains at Qais island the Government • India would presumably prefer to maintain it themselves father than otherwise. If so, they may again see no great objection/years fl objection to undertaking this obligation for five Conversely, if the Persian Government were to exercise their rights of terminating on reasonable notice either (a) or (b) before the end of five years, the Gove* of India would not be placed in a position of any greater difficulty than would have been the ease if the ■cne Persian Government had decided (as they might well have done) to take ' 1/0 ove r the management of the lights and buoys, and to dispense with the light-vessel, from the outset of the new regime. The objections to the termination of (c) without the termination of (b) might be somewhat greater (although the Government of India do not seem ever to have stated that they would be unwilling to lease the light-vessel, except on the condition that they maintained it) 0 If the Government of India were to attach great importance to this point, it would be possible to leave the existing provisions for denunciation unchanged so far as Article 5 is concerned (or alternatively to give the Government of India the right to terminate the operation of this article only In the event of Article 3 ceasing to be operative), but it would be preferable not to make distinctions c It should be borne in mind in regard to all three cases that in the event of any difficulty arising from the failure of the Persian Government to pay for tho services rendered^ this would amount to a breach of the agreement and should in practice effectively relieve the Government of India from their obligations. (3) (The lighting of Stiffe Bank), It does not seem necessary to discuss this point further with the Persian Government, at apy rate in connexion with the Protocol. No a greement with the Persian Government is necessary in order to enable the Government of India to place a light at Stiffe Bank, which/which is not in Persian waters, while at , h e at the same time the Persian Government, who have now had fair. naa fair warning of the Government of India's intentions mia-ht &gt;, hv prrnr , f ^ + ' 6 merel y irritated, by efforts to make them agree in advn-no gree in advance not topiace a light there themselves. The r&gt;nint ^ ihe point is one which might usefully form the subject of discussion between Colonel Ward and Colonel Bayandor, as part of the normal cooperation in lighting and buoying matters which it is to be hoped wijl prevail in future. (Consultation with shipowners). it seems most improbable that the Persian Government intend to repeat this assurance in an exchange of notes, and in Mr. Eden's opinion it will be necessary to rest content with the statement; in M. Motamedy f s letter. (5.) (Contribution to lighting and buoying expenses by Admiralty oilers). The question whether further representa tions are necessary seems to depend on whether or not the Persian Government will in fact have any power to levy dues upon the Admiralty oilers. If not, the point is purely academic, that is to say the Admiralty will literally be in the position of making an ex-grati a payment which the Persian Government will have no alternative but to accept, It will not in that case be necessary to do more (if it is necessary to do anything) than repeat, as a statement of intention or fact, that the Admiralty will make such and such a contribution, since there will be nothing to be gained by pressing the Persian Government to say they will not ask for a certain Concession in the future, if in fact it makes no difference whether they ask or not. If, on the other hand, the Persians likely to be able to compel the payment of dues, by direct or/or indirect methods, the position will he different The question^ see.s therefore to t Ura upon the extent ^ these oilers are exempt from the payment of dues under ' international law and oustom&gt; regard also ^ ^ fact that the Persian Government (i) cannot legally coneot dues except in their own waters (which may however m future include an anchorage off Ahadan) and (ii) are in a posiUon to bring pressure to bear on a company (the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company) with which the oilers are ir ^ oners are m close connexion when in the Persian Gulf, (6} It seems clear that the Persian Government will not repeat the assurance about dues in an exchange of notes and Men considers it will be necessary to accept the assurance in M. Motamedy r s letter, 3 * I am to request that Mr, Eden may receive the observations of Lord Zetland upon the points raised in Mr, Butler 1 s despatch, 4 . Similar letters are being sent to the Admiralty and Board of Trade, and a copy of this letter is being sent to the Dominions Office. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,^ ■ \&gt;M 582/159/34) Ho. 327 ( 71/201/36) N British Legation, Oulhek, 26th June, 19o6, Sir, Acting on the inetruotlone in your telegram No* 42 0f_the_14th Pehruary Jaat on the euh^ct of the transfer to the Iranian Ooverment of certain lighte and buoys in the Persian Gulf, I addressed to the Iranian Government on March 18th the following communications, copies of which (with the exception of (2)) I have the honour to enclose herein:- ij a semi-official letter to Monsieur lotemedy ; li) a c °Py of the revised draft Protocol and the draft exchange of notes; Hi) a memorandum explaining our reasons for the changes introduced into the Persian draft; iv) a note explaining our suggestion that certain assurances desired as to rates of dues and as regards consultation with British shipowners should he embodied in an exchange of notes. 2* The first and covering communication, the letter to Monsieur otamedy, deals with certain points which I was instructed to bring to the attention of the Iranian CJovernment, including the intention of the Government of India to place a light on Gtiffe Bank, and the admiralty’s conditional offer of an ex-gratia payment In respect of Admiralty oilers using the shatt-el-Arab. I was allowed some discretion as regards the time of communicating these two points to the Iranian Government. It seemed test from the points of view and clarity and candour to table our complete proposals. 3. it Honourable toony Eden, M.C. , M.f., ®to«, ©to., etc., The Foreign Office,S - In Pal “ agraph 12 0f ** to AMieur I .«*g.at„ d as next step a oon^ereation between hla and «r. i/oxley. oneieur Motaaedy fen in with thle&gt; and Qn handle to Mr. Loxley on SOth June Mb reply t 0 ^ le tter, gave him eome much-needed elucidation of its meaning.

These documents indicate six points on which the views of the Iranian Government differ in varying degree from those or His Majesty’a Government and the Government of India f and it must, I think* he assumed that they show the Iranian Government 1 e position with sufficient accuracy for working purposes, though the difference as regards oint 2 between onaieur ilotamedy 1 &amp; letter and hie oral explanation of it is conspicuous, 8, This point and point 1 affect the draft Protocol, and I should he glad to learn whether it is possible to meet the views of the Iranian Government, 6, As regards point 8, I have, as instructed informed the Iranian Government of the Government of India's intention to place a new light on Stifle Bank, I do not suppose that anything that Colonel Bay end or might say to Colonel Uarti would or should deflect the Government of India from their intention. But a conversation between these two authorities on this point and on the contents qj paragraph 8 o onaieur Motaaedy *8 letter might be beneficial# It would t.eem probable that the cost of new lights apparently contemplated by the Iranian Government would react on the duet chargeable to British shipping. In am oaae the new light proposed by thethe Government oi' India was not intended to figure in any written agreement between the two Governments. 7. On points 4 and 6 I was Instructed to make a special effort to secure acceptance of His Majesty* &amp; Government’s desiderata in an exchange of notes. As regards point 4 I concur with Mr. hoxley’s comments in his record. The Iranian Government regard point 6 as coming within their exclusive competence and argue that therefore no formal obligation can be accepted. If, as I suppose, I should continue to press for an exchange of notes to cover this matter (as well as point 4) I should be grateful for some appropriate precedent that should carry weight with the Iranian Government. 8. As regards point 5, the conditional offer of the Admiralty, I should be grateful for further Ins time tions. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India ho. 101 and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad Ho. b0. I have &amp;c*, (Signed) Hevile Butler.71/16/36, IBth inaroh, 1936 , ay dear Friend, In your letter or the 20th August last you sent ioxley a draft text of the proposed protoool between the Government of India and the Imperial Government in regard to the transfer to the latter of certain lights, ■buoys etc*, in the Persian Gulf. 2. % Minister referred this text to the Foreign Office and to the Government of India* After careful study a revised text was drafted and I now have pleasure in sending you a copy herewith. Full explanations of the reasons prompting the revisions are contained in an explanatory memorandum, which also I enclose. 3 . In one respect, however, the present version differs in substance from the one which you prepared. Article ? in your draft provided that the Imperial Government should have the right to purchase the waie Island light vessel, if they so desired, at a later date. This article has, however, been omitted from the new draft, as the Government of India regret that they cannot undertake to sell the lightship since they are lihely to require it for use elsewhere when the Imperial Government cease -o rent it. 4. You will probably recollect that it was only at the meeting between yourself, Colonel Bayendor, Colonel Ward and Mr. Coxley, which took place on the 20 xh ug u last, that Colonel Bayendor sieur Motamedy, Ministry fox Foreign Affairs.Ooverment might eventually n nd it deairable to puroha.e the lightship. ..arlier aisoussions had been on the subject of SSmn* the lightship until such time as the Imperial Government had erected a lighthouse on yais Island and you will see fro* Mr. Knatchbulx-Hugessen’s note No. 458 of the 9th August last (17th Mordad, 1314) that the Government of India were onl^ prepared to rent the lightship on condition that they should have the right to remove it and use it elsewhere, outside Iranian territorial waters, at the conclusion of the transitional period under Colonel Ward's management* 5* You will see therefore that even before Colonel B&amp;ywndor made his suggestion the Government of India were proposing eventually to make use of the lightship again themselves* ‘ihey much regret that their own needs make it impossible for them to,agree to sell the vessel to the Imperial Government. 6. You will see too that the Government of India propose that there should be an exchange of notes as well as the protocol* ’these notes (the suggested text of which I enclose) would deal primarily with the question of uues bu they also aafte mention of the collaboration which they are most anxious to see secured between the lighting author! of the Imperial Government and the shipowners chiefly interested. A full explanation of their proposals is contained in a separate memorandum, a copy of which I aj.,-o 7. I do not think that there is anything else to say about the protocol or the exchange ©f notes? but there one more ^ueetion which has not as yet been discussed between us. 6»8. At present the British Atoiralty pay a certain sum to the Government of India In respect of oilers flyi 4 the Blue Ensign (i.e. Admiralty owned oilers on Admiralty Eervloe! in return for the -benefits received from the latter's lighting and buoyliifc service, ’ails sum la not regarded as a payment of dues, but is rather in the nature of an gratia payment. It is, however, computed on the basis of the dues which would have been payable had Admiralty oilers been liable. 9 . I am now authorised to inform you that, when the proposed transfer of lights and buoys takes place, the Admiralty will be happy to make a similar payment to the Imperial Government based on the volume of Blue Ensign tonnage benefiting fro® the lighting service at the rate of three ( 3 ) pies per nett registered ton. This offer is made, not because the Admiralty consider that as a matter of international custom such dues should be paid, but because they realise the exceptional nature of the traffic. Their offer is also made on the distinct understanding that the Admiralty will not subsequently be called upon to pay at a higher rate. 10. I should be very glad to learn that the Imperial Government are reary to accept the above? offer* 11* There is one final point which I think I should biing to your notice. At the meeting held last August, when the of the Imperial Government purchasing tht ,als I&amp;l tu. light vessel was under discussion, Colonel Bayendor mentiored that. If they bought It, they might move it tvo . it-, prexsrt P and moor it on Stiff® Bank. I have etnoe learnt that Government of India themselves propose to pi t fttire that Colonel Stiffe Bank at an early date ana I . +ni»ir Intention* Bayendor would be interested to hear3! • M 12 * 1 eXi;ect that » rheJl you have had time to study the present proposals, you would like to discuss them with someone from the Legation. If so, would you please telephone to noxley V He has been, as you know, present at all the discussioxis and is ^u courant with the whole question. He would be happy to come and talk thing© over any time that suits you. Id, I am already in receipt of full powers authorising me to sign the protocol; bo, if you agree to the latest text, there need be no delay. You will, however, note from the explanatory memorandum on the revised draft protocol that it is not the practice of asy Government to sign such agreements in French, so that we shall have eventually to translate it, (signed. revile Butler,(*) Tha wori 'reritaiiieiaent' .eama to be uanece**^ since it le incluaed in the word 'entretien' end doe* not supper *** &amp; feepuri,te eetim^te in &amp;mw.x 2.

His oral explanations were much mors lucid than is his written word. He said that there were six main points which the- Iranian authorities wished to raise* Other points of wording or of minor detail might occur to them later, ©o he could not go so far as to say that, with the exception of those six points, the Iranian Government accepted our draft as it stood; but in any case there was nothing else of any importance* pint X * Thay consider that, as the Protocol covers such a limited transaction, it is unnecessary to have a preamble* Their own draft (which went to the Foreign Office under cover of our despatch Bo* 377 of August 36th 1935) had not included any such preamble, and they would prefer that we should follow this uodel* I said that I thought that our little preamble was accurate and harmless enough, and that bo ^ a - C; P^a-./ble was usual in international agreements; but lOtamedy ® , k u0 ^ to his point and said that, while such a preamble wo have been appropriate had the agreement been one scope designed to regulate the whole ,ues vion Ox lilh «a buoying i» th. c«ir, t»« *.«»« *'■* *“ case it was quite superfluous. 1 r#frained ir0W ^ the point further as I was doubtful whether it -as of any real importance* Point g*/Point 8.

Island Lightship which is not covered by Article 3 at all feut by Article® S and 5* Their point is that we have agreed (a) to lease them the lightship until auch time as they have erected a lighthouse on shore and (b) to authorise Colonel Ward to operate both the lightship which they are leasing and the lights and buoys which they are purchasing until such time as they are amficiently equipped to take over the task of operation th-. ruselve®# If we now rea rve the right to denounce this arrangement, there ia a risk that they may find themselves landed with a lot of purchased li hte etc», before they are in a position to maintain them {Article 2) or with a leased lightship which they are equally unable to maintain without our help (article )# If we terminate the arrangement laid down in article 3, the risk is rather a different one, namely that their projected lighthouse may not be ready and that Qais Island may be left unlighted* Motamedy was by no means very coherent at this stage and I was quite unsuccessful in trying to get him to keep the three separate points clear in his own mind. But I am pretty sure that the above is what he meant. I aaid in reply that the Government of India could not be expected either to lease the Iranian Government or to lend them the service® Colonel/i 'i h j Colonel ». ra indrtlni,.!, »o th . t . liMt ^ n,e ye.-. h« ^ s «iS 5 , tot orep end .to,. , M „, j aougllt ^ ^ CO,.™™,, or Inal. » 0 ^ a fM „ airnmit to £K&gt; £ dSi lniti© to PlfiCO Oft ! nrn&amp;l 1 Place oolonel bard at their digposal t&amp;T 90 long a period aa five years i. 4 yt5ar ®» curing which time circumstances and arrangement.) might alter considerably, or to promiae to lease the llght.hlp for so long. After all, celonel ard would be giving hie eervioes very much as a ; ®' ° - , as he would be receiving no payment at all from the Iranian overnaent in return, and as for the lightship we had already explained that the Government of India would later require it for their own use elsewhere and they might very well find that they would want it before the expiry of the maximum period of five years laid ,wn l* 1 the agreement. i-'or these reasons it seemed to me that the Government of India would wish to reserve for themselves the right to terminate the interim arrangement before the full live years expired# At the same time I knew that I could assure Monsieur fotamedy that the Government of India would never ta*ce any step that might lead to any dan; or to shipping; and regarding the matter in a practical spirit, I felt sure that there was no need for the Iranian authorities to feel the slightest anxiety that the interim arrangement would be terminated wi i.^out provision having been made for the continuance oi the lighting services# Monsieur Motamedy nevertheless continued to insist/ ^1.meist that the termination hy u. at relatively short notice of the arrangements laid down in articles 2, 3 and 6 might create considerable difficulties for the Iranian authorities. They fully appreciated that the Government of India would desire to f ix . ^ to these arrangements and they had no wish to dispute the suggested period of five years! but they felt that they should only be terminated earlier at the request of the Iranian Government # I did not press the matter further as I thought that Hi# Majesty • s Government and the Government of India might perhaps see no objection to falling in with the wishes of the Iranian Government on this point. Point 3 . is also badly expressed, in the letter. What Monsieur Motamedy is referring to is the statement in paragraph 11 of our letter to him of larch 18 th last that the Government of India are proposing: to place a light on Stiff© Bank at an early date, and the point which he is trying to make is that the Iranian Government take the view that in waters near to their own shores, and in which they are interested iron the point of view of their own shipping, it is for them and not for anybody else to make the necessary lighting arrangements • The Iranian authorities consider that additional lights are desirable in the Gulf and they are therefore making arrangements themselves to put lights on Stiff® Bank, at Kas rfutaf, etc. Monsieur iotamedy even went so far as to murmur that,/that, if the Government of indie «,.♦ ,, , iaia « light on Stiffe Ban^ now, it would have to he removed as soon as the light Which the Iranian authorities ordered was reader. I reacted rather firmly to all this, and explained to Monsieur Motamedy that Stiffe Bank was nowhere near Iranian territorial waters but out in the middle of the Gulf; that it was therefore absurd for them to regard it as their own exclusive pigeon; that we were really far more interested In it than they or anyone else, since the overwhelming majority of shipping usln^ the C-uif was British; that we had made it abundantly clear at the meetings held in the spring of 1935 that we intended to continue to maintain a series of route lights outside Iranian territorial waters; that it would be the greatest mistake in my opinion to introduce more or less political considerations into what was the purely practical and humanitarian Question of ensuring the safety of lives and shipping at sea, that it was equally a great mistake to have more lights than were necessary, as the cost of their maintenance represented a burden on shipping and that it seemed, I refrained from s&amp;yin downright folly but used some rather milder expression, for them to think of ordering a light on their own once they knew that the Government of Indie were placing one on Stiffe Bank in the near future; that the whole question of the location of lights must he settled, not in a spirit of competition but In one of practical co-operation, between all the intereated authorities; and that I thought that the proper way/ed seriously by anybody. Monsieur Kotamedy agreed cordially that queations o; this aort were auoh beat aettled direct between Colonel Ward and Colonel Bayendor, but he did not •eem inclined to modify his original statement of principle* direct and I fear that we nay run up against a certain amount of obstinacy on this latter based on amour propre* roint 4 m This refers to the final paragraph of the proposed exchange of notes and is satisfactory so far as it goes. Monsieur otamedy nsde no suggestion that the Iranian Government would be unwilling to repeat this assurance in a formal exchange of notes# but in view of the attitude which he subsequently developed to me under point 6 (below) it is possible that they nay refuse to commit themselves further. The present assurance in any case represents a considerable advance from the line taXen up last summer by Colonel Bayendor whose sole suggestion was that if ship-owners had any complaints to mme, they could always address them to the Iranian oveminent through the British Legation in Tehran* Refers to paragraph 9 of our letter to Monsieur 4otamedy of March 18 th* • haw ^.t amounuS that/thet the Iranian Government consider that they ere entitled to levy dues on Blue Kn.lgn oilers and that they are unahle to give them any preferential treatment. But they undertake not to discriminate against them in any way. X told Monsieur Motamedy that, as Mr. Butler had said In his letter the Admiralty were not of o inion tnat dues should be paid by such vessel© as a matter of international customs and what they had offered was a voluntary contribution which they were willing to make because they realised the exceptional nature of the wPSafic* j© should now have to refer to them the point which onsieur otamedy had dust made to me and I could give no guarantee as to how they would view it; but, speaking personally, I thought that a mere promise not to charge Admiralty oilers at &amp; higher rat© of duty than ordinary merchant vessels would be regarded by the Admiralty as a niggardly and even ungracious response to their offer. Monsieur Motamedy then seemed to imply that the standpoint expressed in his letter did not exclude the possibility of giving Admiralty oilers more favourable treatment then other vessels; it merely meant that under no circumstances would they be subjected to less favourable treatment, hut he was by no means clear, and when he half-suggested that some concession might he possible, u farmed the impression that he was speaking without authority* In view of the second pare raph of Mr. Kiel's v « Ath 1935• of which a copy letter to Mr. beal of '.camber 4th laoo, was/■ ' I wa B sent to ub under cover of Foreign Office despatch No. 610 of December 6th, I thought it best not to Bay any more at this £0Mi_6. Refer* to the other half of the proposed exchange of notes, namely to the assurance about dues. Monsieur Jotamedy stated that as a matter of principle the Iranian ttovernment could not £ ive us the assurance for which we had asked, as they considered that all citiestians of taxes, &amp;a@s and other charges levied by a Government for any purpose fell within the exclusive co ipetence of that Government. nevertheless the Government had decided that their lighting charges would be fixed in relation to their expenses, and that they would in no way regard then as a source of revenue • He had stated this quite clearly in his letter and the letter would serve as a written assurance for us. Further than that the Government could not o. X feel that the conversation was of some use in that Monsieur lie, tamedy made clear many points in the letter that would otherwise have been obscure or even misleading. I think; that I have recorded his explanations correctly, but he is always apt to be vague when it comes to points of exact detail and on »ome of the matters which we discussed (notably points 2 and 5} he did not seem to be by any means clean in his own “ lnd * I have on the other hand not the slightest confidence that any useful purpose was served bj eny 4 ntninedy was beiug transferred my observations# donsieui otau y to a new Department two days later and wasX if ^ oCt-oc, IV reply to this letter should be ^ addressed to— THE SECRETARY, Board of Trade, f Great George Street, Westminster, S.W.l, the following reference number 3d:— M. 11082/36. f^r oFTEiDR ■ 4 ' / N i * r&lt; 5 ? / i yj/Ust'C a n c: ^ U U u J | q x q / Great George Street, Westminster, S.W.l. 22nd August, 1936. kf £Sli ' ^' 11 The Board of Trade present their compliments to The Secretary of State for India in Council, and beg to transmit herewith for information copy If a letter of to-day’s date which they have caused to be addressed to The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W. 1, Reference to previous correspondence (if any): ^ V E: CLOSURE lN(Alft MAIL -LcVTui mo. 3(T 3/- v-36.

To place a light-vessel there beforehand/ .1 'JULB30.beforehand might suggest to them that we did not trust them to run their lights well, hut to do so afterwards would he proof positive of the fact, and might mate them think that they had gone to unnecessary expense into the bargain. A lighted ouoy however is psychologically a different matter and subject to Butler's views I doubt whether it would matter much at what stage of Persian activity at Qais we were to place one at Farur Shoal or elsewhere in relatively close proximity to Qais. 3* 1 may add that X once took the same view, ahout a light-vessel at Stiffe Bank as about one at Farur Shoal, But since the Admiralty have said that a light at Stiffe Bank would not do away with the necessity for a light at Qais or in its vicinity r and since this view could presumably be convincingly expressed to the Persians if the need arose, the point has lost its importance. 4.

Shah Allum shoal is a small isolated shoal and can be avoided with little difficulty by a detour in either direction, without adding more than a few miles or so to the distance run. ffe feel, therefore, that a light buoy on this shoal would be somewhat in the nature of a luxury, and cannot be considered in any way essential.

Please 1 7»l Department ^ L ht kk 4 4424 5000 1.36 see the Bahrein Petroleum Company*s letter below in which suggestions are made for lighting and buoying arrangements in the Persian Gulf. The idea of placing a light buoy on Shah Allum Shoal was raised by colonel Ward last year (see papers in the bound volume below P.Z.321/35). as it had no direct bearing on the question of transferring lights and buoys to the Peislans, the matter was not pursued at the time, although it was recognised that such a buoy would be of considerable help to vessels making for Bahrein. Farur Shoal, of course, came up in connection wit? the proposed negotiations with the Persian Government and it was suggested that a light might suitably be placed there with the object of maintaining a complete chain of reliable route lights outside Persian territorial waters. You will remember that the Admiralty^stated that it would be necessary to have a light either at Qais or Farur Shoal even if a lightship were placed on Stiffs Bank. This state of affairs will be realised if the present plans are carried out, i.e.*the transfer of the Bahrein Lightship to Stiffe Bank and maintenance of the Q,ais Lightship in its present position under the terms of the Protocol*which the Persian Government are now being asked to sign. Under the Protocol, however, the lease of the Lightship for the Persian Government ends after five years and unless the Persians in the meantime have made arrangements to light Qsis island, i.e. the proposed lighthouse, it will be necessary to take some steps to light Farur Shoal. On the whole the obvious course seems to be to wait for the trme being before placing a light/whether the Persians do, in !* I'U i light on parur Shoal to see fact, place a lighthouse on Q,ais Island. But if the Admiralty or the Government of India felt strongly that it was preferable not to depend upon the Persians and to establish a light buoy immediately on Farur Shoal, I do not think there is any objection to this course. As regards action to be taken on the Bahrein Petroleujja Company*s letter, 1 suppose the ultimate decision as to whether any effect is to be given to their suggestion lies with the Bombay Advisory Committee. Before referring the matter to India, however, we might consult the Foreign Office, Admiralty and Board of Trade to see whether they have any views to express. A draft letter is attached accordingly.^ l [I % raft Paper. 4.9^ ■&gt; • v*' Department. H.L.Baggallajr Esq., F.O.

The suggestionswhich Mr. Hamilton puts forward seem prima facie to be reasonable. The possibility of lighting Shah Allum Shoal was put forward last year by Colonel Ward (see his letter of 8th December enclosed in Baghdad Despatch of 13th December, 1934, 110.706). Although it was realised that such a buoy would be of considerable value to vessels making for Bahrein, the matter was not pursued at the time as it was not directly connected with the immediate problem at issue, i.e. the transfer of control of lighting arrangements within Persian territorial waters to the Persian Government. The possibility of lighting Farur Shoal did, of course, arise in connection with tii*# questiony and ae-ft-resttlir ef the meeting held at the India Office on 7th October, 1935, the Admiralty stated that even if a light were placed on Stiffe Bank it would be essential to have in addition a light at Q,ais or on Farur Shoal Seal»s letter ( of h 25th October Wo.M* 04720/35) • jf ) j I L 1 ji 599 5000 2.36 - Jf j J i— —*— — Persian Government accept the draft Protocol transferring to them the lights, buoys and beacons now maintains^ by the Government of India in Persian territorial waters, the Qais lightship will remain at its present position for five years, and ii/ therefore seems dj!' unnecessary to have a light on Parur Shoal as well* At the end of five years it may, however, be necessary to put one there if the Persians have not in the meantime made their own arrangements for lighting Qais.

In the absence of Mr. Ballantyne from London, The Bahrein Petroleum Co.Ltd. has asked me to convey to you certain suggestions which would be helpful to all ships navigating the southe-ly and southeasterly portions of the Persian Gulf. These suggestions are the result of recommendations made by the masters of several ships which have had occasion to call at Bahrein. The suggestions are as follo?/s:- (1) That a first class lightbuoy be located on Shah Allum Shoa.1 (Lat.L6-25.5 Long.52-3J*0) ♦ This shoal is shown on the chart (B.A. 2837 B) as being covered with only two and a half fathoms of water. It lies almost directly in the path of vessels traversing the route between Kais and Bahrein Lightvessels, and is a definite hazard to navigation for vessels on this route. Such a buoy would also materially benefit vessels bound to and from ports in the northern part of the Gulf. (2) That a first class lighted buoy be located on the southern edge of Farur Shoal. Vessels pass between Farur Island and Farur Shoal, a matter of six miles, and though Farur Island is visible under reasonably good night conditions for three or four miles, the danger of getting too near the Snoal (2g- fathoms) is apparent. It is believed a buoy on.the Shoal is more desirable than a light on the island. The installation of this aid would be of benefit to all vessels navigating the Gulf from any direction. You will appreciate, of course, that these suggestions are of~e-ed in the interests of all shipping in the Persian Gull. M.J.Clauson Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.

I know that Ward suggested an at interdepart mental masting in tns autsoian (see your despatch Ko. 61-3f/55/54) of bdrd October last) that perhaps the reason why the Iranians wanted to buy the light- was to save thsmsslvst the troubling of ereot- ia ^ a lighthouse on -fais Island. :%ard may, of so-ores, have picked up some evidence as to this at &gt;asra or ‘ horraaghahr, but no hint has ever emerged in convsrsa- tion here that the Iranians are not going- to build a light house and Charles Batsman’s letter of the 29th November to Victor seems to show that Ward now thinks that the Iranians are in fact going ahead# **• I shall be seeing J»iotume&amp;y in a few days time (after Bo kusj toy © talk about the protocol and I *111 tac.rly him then.

The protocol in its final form, which the Persian Government will now be asked to accept, will be found immediately below. 1 ^ ^ The main points of the Agreement are briefly the following.* ^feat the Persian Government will purchase at the Government of India* s valuation all the lights and buoys maintained in Persian territory or territorial waters (Clause 1) except the Q,ais Lightship which the Persian Government will lease temporarily from the Government of India (Clause 3); that the lights and buoys and Qais Lightship will be maintained temporarily by Colonel Ward at the expense of the Persian Government (Clauses 2 and 5). To turn to more technical details, the period for the interim arrang ernents, whereby the Q,ais Lightship will be leased to tbe Persian Government and whereby Colonel ward will perform the services of maintenance,has been fixed at five years, either parly reserving the right to break the arrangement at six months’ notice in accordance with the Government of India* s aiggestion. The Foreign Office in their explanatory note below have suggested that an initial period should be fixed before the denunciation by either party at six months’ notice can come into effect. They have suggested that this initial jeriod should be one fcar, which seems quite suitable and it is submitted that we should accept. The -^.ovioiOK**. lease and maintenance are, of course, separate and can be denounced, if desired, at different times. As regards insurance and the premiums which the Persian Government are to pay, the Foreign Office have pointed out that the estimate provided hy the Government of India for the insurance of the crew seems very small. I do not think, however, that it is worth while referring the matter back to India as they state quite clearly in their telegram at P.Z. 281 that the rate is calculated, per ton and not per man, and the figure though apparently small must therefore be correct. To turn to a more important point: the protocol as it stands does not provide for the permanent maintenance by the Persian Government of a light on Qais Island. In view of the transfer of the lights and buoys to the Persian Government, it was thought desirable to maintain a separate and selfcontained route of lights outside Persian territorial waters. With this object, it was decided at a meeting held at the India Office in October (see P. Z.7234/35) 1lo establish a light on stiffe Bank. This scheme the eventual use of the present Qais Lightship after its lease to the Persian Government had expired. It had originally been contemplated to sell the Qais Lightship to the Persian Government with a saving clause that it should not be removed from its present position unless other/Minute Paper.

Our means of forcing the Persian Government to maintain some light on Q,ais Island disappeared with a decision not to sell the t r Qais Lightship to the peraans. But the conclusions of the meeting were based on the that it was not necessary to maintain lights both at Stiffs Bank and on Qais Island. This view was subsequently denied by the Admiralty (see their letter at P.Z.7760/35) but there is nothing we can do new, to alter the situation. It is to be hoped that the Persian plan to build a lightship on Qais Island will materialise; there seems some hope of their doing so - see Mr. Batemans letter at P.Z*152/36. The inclusion of the words n a condition que^dit bateau-phare sera maintenu dans son emplacement actuel” in Article 3 at any rate ensures that the lightship will not be moved during the period in which it is leased to the Persian Government. It is submitted, therefore, that we should concur in the terms of the draft pr otocol and agree to the steps which the Foreign Office now propose to take, which consist in - (1) asking the Persian Government to accept the protocol and sign it; (2) to inform the Persian Government that we do not propose to sell the Q,ais Lightship, (3) to ash the Persian Government to Si^e assurances that they will ^ “ h !t?L ns es; dues out of proportion to their P (4) ^that the Government of India a £® Jf 0p0SinS K 1 c to place a light on stiffe Banh.

But for reason(s) given in your express letter, and as there is no guarantee that Qais light will not be moved, we agree with your conclusion that a light should be placed on Stiffs Bank by readjustments proposed in conclusions of meeting at India Office.

Under these circum stances, I took over custody of the Keys and Stores of Henjam Light, until such time as arrangements can be made for a man to attend the Light, for the purpose of cleaning the glass. The re is an Iranian Naval Petty Officer stationed permanently at Henjam, who on interview appeared to be of the average intelligence, and if the Iranian Government have already takeover this Light, I would suggest that arrangements are made with the Government that this man, or another rating nominated for the purpose of attending the Light* '’Hearchus' is proceeding to Henjam next Cruise, and any rating so nominated could be shown fully what his duties would consist of On arrival at Jask enquiries were made of the astern Telegraphs Co. (which is in the charge of an Indian, both European Officers having loft) as to when the Company were closing down kcre and what arrangements they intended making with regard to ^0 finding and cleaning of Jask Light. They informed me that M definite date could he given with regard to closing down U*certain amount of secrecy exists with regard to this tranter that until the Office was transferred the Co. would continue to Provide a man for attention to the Light, and when the transfer did take place, they would inform Basra Officially through&gt;2~ through their Head Office in Karachi. In my W/T Message Ho* 6/11, X suggested that arrangements were made with the European Representative of the K#L*M.

Under these circumstances, I would suggest as at Ken jam, that the Iranian Govt, is approached with a view to nominating a man for this duty, or for the payment of the present man, who is quite willing to carry out the duties, and is quite efficient. The rates of pay for these attendants is K^mm Rupees 5 &amp; Jask Rs*!8 per mensem, these amounts at present being paid by the Telegraph Company through their books and collected direct from the Government of India.

QOMIJMElIM * 15th November, 1935, My dear Hendel, May I refer to a semi-official letter, 1^3856/354- addressed to Clauson on the 33rd July, on tbe subject of Persian lights and buoys- A copy of this letter was sent to you, Ih# Admiralty have recently had under consideration the question of the contribution which pay at present direct to the Government of India, which is dealt with in paragraphs 4 and 5 of ?ay letter under reference. Phis contribution, although it is not regarded ae a payment of dues but rather in the nature of an ex gratia payment, is computed on the basis of the dues wMou would have been paid by oilers flying the 31u@ Ensign U.e«, Admiralty owned oilers on Admiralty service) if they had been liable. T , In/In paragraph 5 we expressed the view that w@ ought not to agree to pay a subvention such as this to a foreign government, is, however. Blue Ensign tanker tonnage amounts to something like ono-tenth of the total tonnage using the ihatt ©1 Arab, it seems likely that the estimates which Colonel hard has furnished to the Persian Government will be thrown out unless a part of the Admiralty subsidy is paid, directly or indirectly, to the Persian Government* he have therefore considered the possibility of arranging with Colonel hard that charges raised by him on the Persian Government for services rendered should be reduced by an amount roughly proportional to the Admiralty subsidy. Inis however, is open to the objection that it ’would mean that Colonel hard would virtually have to cook his accounts 1 , which might place him, or his successor, in a very embarrassing iK)sitign ^^any^tima. ffurihermora, , withhold the proportionof the payment which would be the share of the at the reduced rate, this would falsify the estimates which Golonel Ward has furnished, The fact that we pay a subvention on account of dues is no secret, and it is possible that we should be faced, sooner or later, with a request for payment. If the Persians found out that we had all along been paying the Government of India on the new reduced, scale, our position would not be a very dignified one, We feel, therefore, that it is probably best to grasp the nettle firraly and to tell the reman Government that we are prepared to make an ex gratia payment based on the Blue Bnsign tonnage using the Shatt at the rate of 3 pies per ton, adding that this offer is made, not because we consider that as a matter of international custom such dues should be paid, but because we realise the exceptional character of the traffic in the Shatt el Arab. Also that it is made on the distinct understanding that the/Illtrie Admiralty will not be expected to pay at my higher rate in the future. he should be very glad to receive in due course the views of the foreign Office and other interested Departments on this question. I am sending copies of this letter to Olauson at the India Office and Grinshaw at the iioard of Trade. ✓ lours sincerely. E. A. SEAL.'r .04720/35. -t COHFIDE NT i AL».

The Admiralty feel that there is a possibility that the statement in para. 2, to the effect that if a light were placed on Stiffe Bank a light at Qais would no longer be required, requires some qualification if misunderstanding is to be avoided. We have always regarded a light at Qais or in its vicinity (i.e. on Farur Shoal) as essential whatever happens at Stiffe Bank. If you will refer to Admiralty letter M. 0173/35 of 31st January you will, see that the Admiralty originally suggested that the Qais rornbie Esq. . *opy sent cy air maii. Light... untie Esq., INDIA OFFfCE, S.W.l.t' Light vessel should be moved to Farur Shoal. ** Subsequently, in deference to the views of the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, and the Commander-in-Ghief, East Indies, we agreed that a light vessel on Stiffs Bank, with a lighted buoy , at Farur Shoal, would be acceptable (Admiralty letters M. 01682/35 of 19th March, and M.01923/35 of 9th April). The Advisory Committee in Bombay were of opinion that the Qais Light vessel should be moved to Farur (letter from Flag Officer Commanding Royal Indian Navy dated 28th May, No.P.Z. 4797/35). I am sorry if we did not make it clear at the meeting that the Admiralty view is that a light at Qais or on Farur Shoal is essential, even if Stiffs Bank is lighted. The Bombay Advisory Committee, (in the letter I have quoted above), thought this light should be a proper light vessel, but, as pointed out above, we have agreed that...i. 04262/35 5 Sir, 1 am cosimndea by ly Laras aommissioners of the Admiralty to refer to Foreign Office letter No. dated 30th September, 1935, on the subject of the transfer to the Persian Government of certain lights buoys and beacons at present mintsiinm by the Government of India in Persian territory or territorial waters. Tht question raised in paragraph 2 of your letter whether the Qals light vessel should be sold to the Persian Government was dealt with at a meeting held at the India Office on the 7th October. My Lords are in general agreement with the conclusions reached by this meeting as recorded in the note forwarded with India Office letter P.3.7234/1935, dated 15th October. The conclusions of this meeting also dispose of the matters raised in paragraphs ?, 8 and 9 of your letter under reference. With regard to the. question of obtaining from the Persian Government undertakings to the effect that dues shall be moderate and that the shirring interests eff ected fey the dues will be consulted. My Lords desire to offer the comment that the view originally expressed by the Admiralty was that the Persian Government should only be allowed to take over the Qais light vessel in return for an agreement not to charge excessive dues. This view was expressed in a semi-official letter M.03504/34 dated 22 Member, 1934 addressed to Mr. Rendel pntl.ffomary of State, fJt &amp;IGN OFFICE. 3.W. 1. It • • . * &lt;It seems to Their Lordships that now that the Rire 0 f the vessel to the Persian Government has been tentatively srrsnred, the Government of India might be put it a false position in relation to shipping interests if the Persian Government started to charge unreasonable oues. it foaid appear that the Government of India had not merely assented to en arrangement which involved an unnecessary increase of dues, but were taking an active part in it by maintaining the light vessel on behalf of the Persian Government. Having regard to the fact that an informal undertaking such as has so far been made would not be binding upon a subsequent Persian Government, My Lords still attach great importance to an undertaking without reasonable oues being on record, and they suggest that Vr. Knatchbull-Hugessen should be given a free hand to do the beat he can to secure a written agreement, either in the protocol or in an exchange of notes, whichever he thirds the Persian Government are most likely to accept. dories of this letter are being sent to the India Office and Board of Trade.

Lighting and Buoying in the Persian Gulf. 2. Please see record of a meeting at the India Office on 7th October with Colonel Ward, copy of which is enclosed herewith. 1 should be grateful if you could consult Bombay Advisory Committee and let me have your views in due course with as little delay as possible on proposal to place a light on Stiffs Bank by making the arrangements suggested in the conclusions set out at the end of the record. importance of maintaining a complete chain of reliable route lights under our own control has already been fully recognised by G.of I. and Bombay Advisory Committee (vide your telegram No.1568 of 27th June last) and we can have no guarantee that a Persian light house on Q.ais Island will always be reliable. It is understood from Colonel Ward that if light is placed on Stiffe Bank light at Q,ais will no longer be required. It is desirable to reach a fairly early decision on this question in/iiii. I w in view of risk that Persians may be seriously contemplating putting a light on Stiffe Bank themselves and there seems much to be said for proposal to forestall them by making interim arrangements suggested in (l)(a) of the conclusions of the meeting. There is indeed remote possibility that if G.of 1. decide to light Stiffe Bank at an early date and consequently decline to sell Q,ais li &amp; ht vessel to Persian Govt, latter may not after all proceed even with erection of lighthouse at Q^ais Island (vide Colonel yard’s remarks on page 6 of record). This would of course he highly satisfactory r as Persians would then have no excuse for collecting dues in respect of route lights ifr I after date on which they cease to hire Q,ais lightship. 3. With regard to P.0.letter under reference I am inclined, subject to your concurrence, to agree generally with views expressed in that letter, except that I should be disposed to press Persian Govt, to confirm by exchange of notes undertakir in regard to dues already included in . provisional agreement enclosed in Tehran I despatch of 2nd May unless it is quite ^ clear that they will not now in any circumstances consent to do so. Subject to your views I also propose to concur in J form of draft protocol and exchange of notes enclosed in P. 0 .letter, subject to J g ! • ; ' i ^-io-or modification in Protocol mentioned below/-aft Paper Department. 3761 5000 5.05 below, in which p.0» have concurred. Paras. 7 and 8 of Protocol will of course be of no effect if G. of I. agree to proposal mentioned above for lighting Stiffe Bank and consequently decline to sell Q,ais light vessel to Persians. 4. Draft Protocol at present provides (Article*5) for maintenance of light vessel in its present position as long as Col. Ward continues to be responsible to the Persians for its upkeep, or (Article 8) until they have made other arrangements for security of shipping in this neighbourhood. To guard against any possibility of Persians dispensing with services of Col. Y/ard and then * possibly claiming that they are free to move vessel, possibly to Stiffe Bank, in virtue of some makeshift arrangement at Q,ais, I-.O. have agreed to insertion of words condition que le dit b&amp;teau-phare sera maintenu dans son emplacement actuel' at. end of first sentence of Article 3. This would have effect of preventing Persians from moving vessel at all during interim period during which they hire it from G. of 1. Consequential amendment would be made in Article 8, part of which would then be redundant. 5 . as regards provision in Article 4 for/ ‘s— for insurance of q,ais v e ssel - please let me have figure for insurance premium for insertion in that Article unless you prefer alternative rendering 6 . dur.tlin of int.rl. arrangements envisaged hy protocol (vide paragraph 2 on page 2 of explanatory- note enclosed in F.O. letter), G- of I. if they accept arrangements suggested above in regard to lighting of Stiffe Bank will no doubt wish, to resorv© right to terminate obligation^ to lease Qais light vessel to Persians after fairly short period, say 2 or 3 years. 7, I should be grateful if you could telegraph your views on P.0» letter and enclosures as soon as possible, as P.0» are anxious to conclude Protocol with Persians without further delay. I presume there would be no objection to informing Persian Govt, at once in sense of proposal (2) of conclusions of meeting at 1.0. in advance of decision on question of lighting Stiffe Bank. 8.

It was consideration whether we ourselves would have to place another route light in the Gulf if the q.ais light vessel were handed over to the Persians and if at Mr. CLA.USON read out the two relevant passages from Foreign Office letter Ho. E. 5374/33/34 of 30th September to the India Office which dealt with tnis question . j 4 -'hct fhe persists Na-d told Him s-t Colonel Ward said that tne .. r-r huving the Oais lightship and Tehran that they thought of buying putting/2. putting it on the Stiff© Bank. In his view, however, it wa s not practicable to put the present Q.ais lightship on the Stiffe Bank. The vessel was too small and unsuitable for the depth of 15 fathoms on the Stiffe Bank. If we ourselves decided to place a lightship on the Stiffe Bank he would suggest that the Bahrein lightship should be used for this purpose. Alternatively he understood that the Persian Gulf Lighting Service had funds in Bombay which might possibly be enough for the purchase of a lightship. Even if a new lightship were purchased he thought that there would probably be no necessity to increase the present dues charged by the Persian Gulf Lighting Service, though of course the Persians would no doubt charge dues of their own for the Q,ais lightship if the latter were handed over to them or for their Light House at Q,ais Island if in fact they erected one. There had, he thought, been some misunderstanding in regard to his own proposals on this subject. 'What he had suggested to the Persians at Tehran was that they might charge a due of 3 pies. To the Government of India he had suggested that his own organisation should simultaneously reduce their own dues by a similar amount. His own organisation and the Persian organisation would both collect their dues from all ships entering the Shatt-el-Arab . Basra and Abadan were to intents and purposes the same for this purpose and 4./ t of the shipping in the Shat t-el-Arab went to Abadan. explained that, in fact, his officers did not visit ’p in the Shatt in order to collect their dues, bu^ mer called upon the various shipping agents to P a ! U P- practice this was found to work very well. Colonel Ward said that he had recommended to the Persians that t y should charge separately in respect of lights at harbours on the Persian coast. -As regards the hat transfer/3. transfer of the lights and buoys to the Persian Government Colonel Ward said that the first day of any month would suit him for this purpose. He had suggested that on his return to Basra, he might invite Lieut.-Colonel Bayendor, the Commandant of the Persian havy, to go a trip with him in the 'Nearchus 1 ’ in order to show him the lights and buoys which the Persians were buying. He had no intention of taking Bayendor over to the Arab coast of the Gulf. He expressed the opinion that the Persians would probably allow him, Colonel Ward, to look after their lights and buoys for them, even at Bandar shapour. This would be ideal from his point of view since he would no longer be troubled with passport difficulties etc. when he visited lights on the Persian coast of the Gulf. But as regards the dues he did not know whether the Persians would accept his suggestion lor a 3 pie rate. If the Persians collected their dues themselves, which he felt sure they would, it would cost rather more and they might have to raise the rate to 4 pies, although he Lad informed them that the Basra port Autnoiities at present made no charge in respect of collection. ±he Persians h assured us that they would not charge more by way of dues than was necessary to cover the cost ox the maintenanc the lights and Colonel Ward was optimistic tnat they intended to keep this assurance. MR. CLAUSOK hinted that the India Office and the Government of India might not be in a hurij na,.d , r&lt;^-rror'nm pt 1 t uniess they lights and buoys to the Persian u- • t 4 - -Tvnrr’ the Persians, viz. obtained their political desidera^, a formal assurance about the dues to be G •a +&gt;,q+ there was a danger that if COLOHEL WARD said tnat tnere • , x 'u • the Persian Government, the sold the Qais lightship to the 1 ei .. + -ni are it upon the Spiffs latter might at once ask him P Bank/Bank.. Bayendor had said that this was what the Persian Government iniynt wisn to do 0 it might possibly be desirable for us to anticipate this Persian move by putting a light on the Stiffe Bank ourselves. He could 5 of course 9 tell the Persians that the Qais lightship would be unsafe on the Stiffe Bank and that if they put it there they would certainly lose it. MR. SEAL suggested that a provision should be inserted in the protocol which it was proposed to conclude with the Persian Government that the Qais lightship should be maintained in its present position throughout the period during’ which the Persian Government hired it from us. MR. BAGGALLAY said that the present draft protocol provided that the lightship must remain where it was while Colonel Ward continued to maintain it and also until the proposed Persian lighthouse on Qais Island was ready. CAPTAIN BRANDON said that in the opinion of the Board of Trade a lightship was not required on the Stiffe Bank so long as there was an adequate light at Qais Island. He saw no reason why we should put a lightship there just because the Persians had made a casual suggestion that they mi^ht do so. It had been said that we would not be able to relj- on the Persians looking after lights and buoys efficiently, but he thought that we ought to give the Persians a chance and see whether, in fact, they proved inefficient. He pointed out that the Egyptians had proved themselves perfectly capable of running a lighting service efficiently. COLONEL WARD said that his Persian pilots were nioo class, and that the lights in the Gulf were manned by Indians, He was not satisfied that if lights were left to be managed altogether by the Persians they would be run efficiently, and that was why he had previously suggested moving tne Qais light vessel to a new position outside Persian tern tonal waters. If, however, the Persians allowed Britis supervision/5 0 supervision 9 that is if they allowed his own organisation to supervise the running of their lights ? he would then be quite confident that they would be looked after satisfactorily 0 By way of illustration he instanced the problem of supplying rations to the personnel of light vessels in bad weather and the recent breaking adrift of the Bahrein light vessel. In order to meet emergencies of this nature he had two ships available which were suitable for work of this kind» Would the Persians be prepared to maintain ships for the same purpose? If 9 however 9 they allowed him to do work of this kind for them it would fit in with the rest of his organisation and would not involve much extra costo MR. SEAL said he thought that there was a world of difference between allowing the Persians a completely iree hand to run their own lights 9 and employing non-European light-keepers under European supervision as in Egypt and. Malaya 9 or for that matter in the Gulf itself under the present regime. It had often been stated that the Persians had no sense of responsibility in practical matters such a.o this, and Colonel Ward had confirmed his impression that the Persian Government could not be trusted to keep then light keepers up to the scratch. Under European supervision the^ knew that there would be !, the devil to pay if anythin en' wrong owing to carelessness or neglect, he also emphasised the political importance of keeping the initiative in connection with these lights, and recalled that poll considerations had played a large part when the seivice originally started by the Government of India, He therefore suggested that the Persians should be told that ohe Government of India intended to use the Qais light/lio'ht vessel themselves when the Persians had finished using it and that they also intended to light the Stiffs Bank. COLOKdL WARD said that the easiest way to light the Stiffs Bank would Be to put the Shatt-el-Aral light vessel on the Stiff® Bank and Bring the Q,ais light vessel up to the Shatt-el-Arab in exchange. MR. CLAUSOK also suggested that we might now tell the Persians that we were douBtful if, after all, we should he aBle to sell them the qais lightship, and that in any case the latter would Be unsafe on the Stiffs Bank. MR. HAYLETT said that the Board of Trade would see no oBjection to this suggestion Being put to tne Government of India. MR. BAGGALLAY said that the position was tha tn the Persians on a were about to rent the Qais lightship n the latter had erected a light provisional basis until -cm*ir,d The Persian Government, house themselves on Qais island. to nut a light vessel on the Stiff® might then propose to put a 6 i 4 f thev could get it, or Bank - the qais light vessel, some other vessel if they could n , s . , d , d n ot think that the Persians COLONEL WARD said he di - i i^ht vessel* h e Tfould want to purchase any 0 ° th. real reason why they had suggested that perhaps tha real • n i p-Ht vessel was to save offered to Buy the qais ■ light ho use at themselves the trouble of put ib„ ^ ^ tende rs for qais. The Persian Government had ca ^ . r of ,t furnished a light house, But they had, in ± • ' - irrl to Be able to submit insufficient data for any tenderB - + d tliat we should put it to the MR. CLAUSOH suggested . not desirable to pu -r Tnriia whether i^ VvaS Government of /7» a light on the Stiffe Bank Both in order to have a complete chain of route lights under our own supervision and because Colonel Ward was of opinion that we should not be able to depend indefinitely on the efficiency of a Persian light house. It might be desirable, in view of the desire expressed by the Persians to light the stiffe Bank, to take this action soon. The question was v/hether we should be able to light the Stiffe Bank until we were free to take away the Qais light vessel to replace whatever light vessel it was decided to put on the stiffe Bank. COLONEL WARD suggested that as an interim arrangement it would be possible to borrow the Bahrein light vessel ion the Stiffe Bank replacing it temporarily by a lighted buoy, later, when the Persians had erected their light house at Q,ais, if that ever happened, tne Bahrein light ship could be brought back to Bahrein, the shatt -el-Arab lightship placed on the Stiffe Bar* in its place, and the Q,ais lightship removed to the Shatt. MR. SEAL suggested that we should accordingly teii he Persians definitely that we should not now be prepared o sell the qais lightship because we would require it , . ■ lighting of the Stiffs urselves in connection wxth the ng ^ sank when they had finished with it. . + wol) i d be quite legitimate MR. BAGGALLAY thought it tfoda ;o- inform the Persian Government that we should need ^ais light vessel for our own purposes in due course. MR. HAXLETT said that the Board of Trade still fel • 4 -v, o-i ion that thes® dissatisfied in regard to the n , a+p in vie w of the fact that there arrangements would create, 4-0 i i oht over and above would be in existence an extra rou ^ • -Urn - i.e. there would be a those essential to navigation light/8 . light cit (^&amp;is BTi d a ligiit on Stifio Eanic• This must necessarily mean tha.t shipping would have to for one light more than it required. The Board of Trade would not, however, object to the scheme being put to the Government of India on the understanding that the latter would consult the Advisory Committee at Bombay. It was pointed out that the scheme would not involve any increase in the dues charged by the Persian Gulf Lighting Service, the only increase being in respect of dues charged by the Persians for the light house on Qais Island, if the latter ever materialised. COP CLU SI Oh S. It was finally agreed that the Government of India should be asked for their views, after consultation with the Bombay Advisory Committee, on the proposals set forth beiow, bearing in mind the practical importance of maintaining a complete chain of reliable route lights under our own control, and the possibility that a Persian-controlled lighthouse on Qais island might prove ultimately to be unreliable.

He v/as not satisfied that if lights were left to he managed altogether hy the Persians they would he run efficiently, and that was why he had previously suggested moving the duais light vessel to a new position outside Persian territorial waters. If, however, the Persians allowed British supervision, that is if they allowed his own organisation to supervise the running of their lights, he would then he quite confident that they would he looked after satisfactorily. By way of illustration he instanced the problem of supplying rations to the personnel of light vessels etc. In order to do this he had to maintain two ships to visit the various lights. Would the Persians he prepared to maintain ships for this purpose? If, however, they allowed him to do it for them it would fit in with the rest of his organisation and would involve no extra cost. MR. SEAL suggested that the Persians should be told that the Government of India intended to use the Q^ais light vessel themselves when the Persians had finished using it and that they also intended to light the Stiff© Bank. COLOHEL WARD said that the easiest way to light the Stiffs Bank would be to put the Shatt-el-Arab light vessel on the Stiffs Bank and bring the QMais light vessel back to the shatt-el-Arab in exchange. MR. C LADS ON also suggested that we might now tell the Persians that we were doubtful if, after all, we should be able to sell them the Q.hais lightship and that in any case the latter would be unsafe on the Stiff© Bank. Mr./MR. HA.YLETT said that the Board of Trade would see no objection to this suggestion being put to the G-overnment of India. MR. BAGGALLAY said that the position Y/as that we were about to rent the Q^ais lightship to the Persians on a provisional basis until the latter had erected a light house themselves on Q,^ais Island. The Persian Government might then propose to put another light vessel of their own on the Stiffe Bank. COLOREL WARD said he did not think that the persians^want-etfc* to purchase^ another light -vessel. He suggested that perhaps the real reason why they had offered to buy the Q&gt;yais light vessel was to save themselves the trouble of putting up a light house at Qftais. The Persian Government had called for tenders for a light house, but they had, in fact, furnished insufficient data for any firm to be able to submit tenders. MR. CDAUSOH suggested that we should put it to the Government of India vrhether it was not desirable to put a light on the Stiffe Ban* both in order to have a complete chain of route lights under our own supervisicn and because Colonel Ward was of opinion that we should not be able to depend indefinitely on the efficiency of a Persian -£ight tfouse. it might be desirable, in view of the desire expressed by the Persians to light the Stiffe Bank, to take this action soon. The que was whether we should be able to light the Stiffe Bank until we were free to take away the ^ Tesse to replace whatever light vessel it was decided to put on the Stiffe Bank. COLOMSL WARD suggested that as an interim arrangement it would be possible to borrow the Bahrein 1 1 crht /light vessel for the Stiffs Bank replacing it temporarily A hy a lighted buoy. *fche lightship could tfowa be * brought to Bahrein, Later when the Persians had - - - J erected their light house, if that ever happened. / MR. SEAL suggested that we should 4aw tell the Persians definitely that we should not now be prepared to sell the Q\ais lightship because we would require it ourselves in connection with the lighting of the Stiffe Bank when they had finished with it. MR. BAGGALLAY thought it would be quite legitimate to inform the Persian Government in this sense. MR.

CONCLUSIOHS. It was finally agreed that the Government of India should be asked for their views after consultation with the Bombay Advisory Committee on the following proposals:- (1) To move the Shatt-el-Arab light vessel on to the Stiffe Bank and bring the Q,kais Island light vessel i^ck to the Shatt-el-Arab to replace it as soon as we were free to remove the QMais light vessel ..rom its present position. (2) to borrow the Bahrein light vessel provisionally t • &lt; 2 &gt; To borrow the Bahrein k fc fl for the Stiffs Bank for the interim period during which , .r ^ :&gt;rr, / we / 4 Akw™ '' ■'Xu.we were unable to make use of the lightship.

A re-draft of the Protocol has accordingly been prepared and a copy of this re-draft is now enclose Lord Zetland's consideration. A note explaining the reasons for the principle changes is also enclosed. most of changes involve points of drafting only, but one or two involve points of principle upon which the views of Government of India will be required. The most important of these is the question whether or not the Government of India are willing to enter now into a covenant to sell the Qa light-vessel Mer-secretary of State, India Office. B COPY SENT BY AIR of c-^||o|-^&lt; fcb ■ ulio('vr tAlight-vessel at some future date, or failing that, to agree upon the price to he paid should a sale eventually he arranged. 3. No attempt has been made in re-drafting the protocol to deal with points (1) and {2) of Tehran telegram No. 12 saving of August 26th, i.e. the possibility of obtaining from the Persian Government undertakings to the effect that dues shall he moderate and that the shipping interests affected by the dues will be consulted. Sir Samuel Hoare is aware that these are questions of great practical importance, and that His Majesty's Government are entitled, and indeed under a moral obligation to the British shipping companies concerned, to keep constantly before the Persian Government the necessity, not only of maintaining an efficient lighting service, but also of reducing their dues to the lowest possible level and of consulting the shipping interests paying these dues. But it does not in his opinion follow that His Majesty's Government can insist upon including in a Protocol kind now contemplated a formal assurance regarding dues, and still less a formal assurance regarding the consultation of foreign shipping interests. This Protocol deals with certain .. ^hiin-ations upon the two parties business transactions; the g with the possible exception of are clearly laid down&gt; and* . whether or not they have Article 8, no doubt can arise as letter or in the spirit. The been fulfilled either m ti • ^ the Persian Government, additional undertakings required of however, are of quite a different character. 4 . The most that can be hoped for from the Persian Government in the matter of dues is a declaration of their intention to abide by a general principle - since HisMajesty's Government have no means of compelling the Persian Government to adopt any particular scale of dues - and it would always he difficult to furnish conclusive legal proof that the Persian Government had failed to live up to this principle. In the long run, therefore, the observance of the principle would have to depend, not upon any legal obligation, hut upon the Persian Government's sense of international responsibility. Furthermore, the responsibility would remain the same, whether the Persian Government formally notified their acceptance of this responsibility or not; and if they were to adopt the attitude that it was naturally their intention to abide by international standards in this matter, but that they alone could judge whether their own actions conformed to these standards and that in tne meanwhile they did not feel called upon to give any formal undertaking on the subject n Hpnied that this would third party, it could hardly he denied . , . ^v-n^rted from any other state he the answer which might he expe in similar circumstances. 5. in the matter of the consultation of shipping interests also, the most that can be hoped for is a declaration by the Persian Government of their intention to abide by a principle. But in that case, the princip ■ i rather than a general, principle, for would be a special, rather t ^ ld that any Government is under an obligati cannot he said that any „ . V its waters in consultation with a committee to light and huoy its wauex + . ln an other country. It of ship-owners situated i - . , difficult to establish conclusively moreover, he even more v. ^ fniled to carry out its that the Persian Governmen a PR tablish 1+ SU ch a committee than to establish undertaking to consul certain scale i-hiiitv of contradiction that a cer beyond the possibility 01 ^of dues was higher than the circumstances required. As practical measure, the best course for the shipping interests concerned to adopt would seem to be to form a committee of their agents in Bushire or Mohammerah 'and to arrange for this committee to keep in touch with the local Persian lighting authority, either directly or (if this proves difficult), through the British Consular authorities. 6. For these reasons, Sir Samuel Hoare is convinced that the objects which His Majesty's Government have at heart, i.e. the efficient and economic administration of the Persian lighting and buoying system, are most likely to be attained, not by pressing the Persian Government to enter into formal, though abstract, commitments regarding matters which lie wholly within their competence as an independent state, or by relying upon these commitments assuming that it were possible to secure them, but, on the one hand, by taking every opportunity which may present itself of maintaining . +v . +hp Persian Government and their friendly contact with the Pero V, ■ + • « in regard to matters of lighting and buoying, local authorities m regara - bv inai^ing strong representations if an and, on the other, oy making v^niri the Persian Government when the occasion arises, should t + international standards. fail to conform to accepts . . „ nnt feel able to do more than instruct Accordingly, he does not fee Accordingly, ^ ^ GovernBe nt Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen t « that assurances regarding dues and the consultation • + atS should be embodied in an exchange of shipping interests ^ ^ encl0 sed herein. on the lines of those of whic object the Persian Government may not J it is conceivable that ^ ^ Hoare to an exchange of notes m this for ^ ^ ^ ^ ( feels hound to record the opinion tha , i stake from every point of view to it would be a serious mis - h0hold up the transfer of the lights and buoys, that is to say the signature of the Protocol, while the question was being further pursued* 7 # At the end of paragraph 4 of his despatch No.372 of August 23rd (of which a copy was enclosed in Foreign Office printed letter E 5445/33/34 of September 10th), Mr. Knatchbull- Hugessen asks what attitude he should adopt in the event of the Persian Government desiring to acquire the Qais island light- vessel with a view to placing it on Stiffe Bank or at some other port on the international shipping-route. This question has been discussed in an entirely unofficial manner with Colonel Ward, who recently called at the Foreign Office to discuss other matters. Colonel Ward is understood to hold the view that as a matter of practical seamanship it would be extremely dangerous to place this light-vessel on Stiffe Bank, and that the light-vessel to be placed there must be of a larger and more modern type. The plan he would apparently recommend would be to forestall any Persian W PLOW o„ stiffs B.«* .t • «« *»' ““ no. „«, op intOPOsa fof, B.hP.in, •»* «» »* eventually oitheP toe S .l. i.lmi llgM-va.a.l. op .o- oth.P light-veeeel p.poha.od with tM ppoo.ad. of flag placed »..n„l&gt;il. o» the site at B.Op.Ip. »'■* -atter. .Uoh 11. out.ida th. oo.p.t.»« of tM BoP.igP Of tea, „ that if some such scheme is feasible, but Sir Samuel Hoare feels that- i ■ p,+ ci-Mffe Bank (and any other key it would be far better to lig -..nther ■ v ^tuning route) without delay rather points on the international PP f letting a situation develop in which th than run the risk of let,ti g 4 .v, + „ • ond the Persian Government were both Government of India and tn . . n , + Tt is true that if the action upon lighting the same point. -&gt;■ ^ndered it unnecessary for the of the Government of India aont the i -v oht— vessel on Stiffe Bank, the Persian Government to place c*»pk from motives Persian Government might never e eof amour-propre to place a light-vessel at some other point on the international route where the presence of a light was not really necessary. But however deplorable this might be from the point of view of the probable increase in dues, the light-vessel in question wou ia at least not be a potential danger to navigation. 8. in the meanwhile Sir Samuel Hoare considers that if the Persian Government revert to the question, Mr. Enatehbull Hugessen should inform them frankly that it is the intention of the Government of India to place a light-vessel on St'f Bank in any event, and should for the rest do his best to persuade them to rest content with a light-house on Qais island and not to embark upon further schemes for the lighting of the international route, at any rate until they nave taken oil i'ViPip own lights 8.nh hno^s mid over the maintenance of all tneir own x b o-n-i *mnr*p in lighting and buoying matters; have gained some experience m e&gt; « jt* oil &lt;=&gt;i ho avoid raising the and should urge them, failing &gt; dues on international shipping in conseque notwithstanding this advice, the Persian Government appeare disposed to proceed with some such scheme and to have forme the intention of using the Qais island light-vessel m connexion with that scheme, it would be open to the Governmen of India to decline to sell the vessel.

It is extremely difficult to understand the basis of Colonel Lard’s proposals. He has apparently assumed on the revenue side that the Persians will collect dues at the rate of 3 pies per ton on all tonnage entering or leaving the port of Basrah, irrespective of whether they are going to Persian pores or to Irapi. it is not stated whether it is intended to make a corresponding reduction in the dues collected by Colonel Card’s organisation, or whether (as is perhaps more lively judging from paragraph 5 of his letter) he has fixed on the rate of 3 pies because it is the existing rebate off the standard rate, which is understood to be 1 anna per ton in and out. If this is so, it would presumably mean an increase in the total dues payable by shipping. Moreover, towards the end of the letier Colonel hard suggests that the Persians may introduce separate dues at the individual ports to cover the port lights, be think that this is the proper course for tnem to la.ve, but obviously such an arrangement would throw the whole of Colonel hard's calculations out. It would inen only be necessary/ . J. Clauson, Bsq., INDIA OFH®, S.f.l.necessary for the Persians to collect at Abadan or fS Mohammerah a sufficient sum to pay for the Xais Island light vessel, and any other route lights that they may subsequently establish. At the present time the Admiralty are paying a lump sum annually towards the cost of these Persian Gulf lights, based on the dues which would have been paid by blue ensign oilers if they had been liable. This arrange- ment has been explained to the Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom, and must he well-known to the Advisory Committee in Bombay, upon which shipping and other interests are represented. It is, therefore, too much to hope that this arrangement will remain unknown to tne Persian Government. The Admiralty do not think that we ought to agree to pay a subvention such as this to a ioreign government. The arrangement could perhaps be justified as it stands as a recognition of the political desirability of maintaining the lights in British hands, (it may be remembered that originally the lights in the Gulf were established entirely at Government cost, very largely for political reasons), ou, the payment of a part of our contribution to the Persian Government would be a very undesirable precedent. For the above reason we thimc it would oe unwise ttoi an, suggestion should he nade either that the Persians theiaselves raise dues in the lhatt, or tha. one existing dues should he divided with then. In the agree,.ent reaohe at Tehran, the Persian Sovernnent undertoox to refund uo Colonel sard the cost of maintaining the lights until they were/were ready to do so themselves, and it would seem to be preferable to take them at their word, and to make no suggest ion about how the money snould oe raised. he also note from Knatchbull-Kugessen 1 s telegram ho.222 that the suggestion has been made that bard should proceed to Tehran to negotiate the financial and technical details. In view of his letter to Kerr, we fear that he may overstep the mark unless he has explicit instructions, at any rate as to the financial arrangements. I am sending copies of this letter to Rendel at the Foreign Office and G-uttery at the board ox Trade. Yours sincerely,agree with the proposal for the retrieval of ^aais Light ship to a position to the West of Farur Shoal but consider it essential to provide another Light'wessel to be stationed on Stiffe Bank in order to afford facilities for east bound navigation. I am in accord with these views. 5. The matter was further discussed at a meeting of the Advisory Committee held on 27th Jay 19 35 and the views put forward above were confirmed. 6 .
