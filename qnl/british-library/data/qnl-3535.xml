Stannus then goes into greater detail regarding the imports and exports at Bushire. He states that an extraordinary deficiency in the exports can be explained by the fact that they have not been as carefully recorded as the imports. Stannus discusses the pearl trade and speculates on the possibility of Persian opium being introduced to the Chinese market. In addition, he provides summaries of the trade of other Persian ports.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054395.0x000065#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
