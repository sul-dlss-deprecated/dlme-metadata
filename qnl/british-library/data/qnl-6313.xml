Ibn Hithiain was fcoing, to spend all Raaedhea in Riyadh. Half al-Fuqa of the Sahabah sept of the Mu^ahah aubaection of the Ilwah Mutair was also there but no other Ikhwan shalklis. Ibn Hurpaid had not visited Ibn Sa'ud but had been corres- ponain*. with him. He had demanded that Ibn Saud should aend a son or other oloae relative and his standard with the Ikhwan force, but this Ibn Sa'ud absolutely refused to do, saying that it would mean eae regular war with British, and that vre would institute a blockade of all his ports and starve them out. He also refused a request for rifles but sent him 10 boxes of ammunition, 10,000 dollars, 200 oamel loads of dates and rice, and other presents, and said he wished him well. Ibn Huai&amp;ld was said to be leaving Ghatghat for Shaqra, 90 miles south of Artawiyah, on the 2 bth February, and was inviting ail to meet there for a huge raid. The 7th February was the date fixed x’or the concentration but they might not actually move before the k&gt;rd February.

Ail money, arras and ammunition are in his hands and as Ibn Saud has not controlled them he cannot help thinking that his behind Akhwan. Ibn Saud is such a big man that all major affairs affecting him quickly become known in Bahrain in spite of QUHAIBI, and as there is not even a whisper to support the story that Ibn Saud is being coerced, he can hardly believe it.

The Iraq tribes should not take the offensive until such roof is co/plete, but I see no re son why they shoul not make prep rations in case of such *n offensive. The king and the irime Minister h&lt;ve accepted this view. The former however desires to send private messengers to v rious leading chiefs in Nejd in order to soert in the real facts and find out whether they have reall,: decided to join against Iraq.

Your telegram no. 116 of 28th February. I am entirely opposed to counter raids of Iraq tribes, objection^ to which were clearly set out in part two of your telegram No. 104 of £2nc February. further object- •ions to such a course are (l). that it would finally remove any jgxxb prospect there may be of Ibn Baud succeeding in re -establishing control and stopping raiding and (2) that it would definitely convince Ibn Saud that our air action was designed n6t as means of punishing raiders but as instrument of Faisal’s personal hostility towards him. Objections appear to me to apply equally to preliminary steps which Faisal wishes to take. Cnee the idea of counter raids is mooted amongst tribesmen and ^reparations are authorised it seems almost certain that action by tribeuraen will be precip itated, particularly as the Government of Iraq cannot be relied upon to exercise effective restraining influence. You will understand that there is no intention of ruling out employment of tribal levies to assist in defence of Iraq under the control of Air Officer Commanding as was done at the time of the Turkish menace, but if Air Officer Commanding considers he can usefully organise and co-ordinate tribes-raen for this purpose and if he desires to do so it should be clearly unuerstood that they must be wholly under his control.

He says that Ibn Humaid started from G-hatghat according to programme, but only got as far as Shams (70 miles west by north of Riyadh) when he was overtaken by Khalid bin al-Wai (the member of the SharXflan family who joined the Ikhwan and is now one of tne lea m, Ikhwan in the Hijaz), who had arrived in Riyadh a few days earlier, and who now went to Ibn Humaid to try to dissuade him from acting contrary to the wishes of Ibn Sa'ud. He evidently suceeded in his mission, whether by pursuasion or t ireats, as on 5th March Ibn Humaid went back to Ghatghat, His standard was still at Shams but the general opinion was that the raid would nojt ta&lt;ce place. He heard that Dawish was at Artawiyah and his standard about 25 miles south of Safah# No meeting between him and Ibn Huaaid had taken place.

Please refer to telegram No. 11 from British Consul, Jeddah ,to Foreign Office. The fact that Ihn Baud should leave' _dadh and go to Mecca would, as Consul states, normally he read as a sign that the King was confident in improvement of situation. On this occasion I do not think that it can he so read. Evidence before us suggests the following. Ihn Saud is unquestionably still head of his own house ( and in the opinion of the Lhaikhs of Bahrain would he even without the doubtful tribes; but there are strong units which he cannot control on certain points in which he also has sympathy with them, and one of these points is the Iraq and general frontier question, in which is included our aeroplane action. Ke have news from tihreo different quarters that the taibeh are out on the raid. The latest report is that they have eleven banners out or several thousand men and that Dawish is to meet Ibn Humaid at Ai-tawiyah. It is no good for the moment our con- -sidering the obwious justice of our claims regarding the frontier wells. Ibn Gaud is confronted not with the justicejustice of the case but with the view held by his tribes and to this is added his own feeling against the Sharif ruler of Iraq and Lhe perhaps unavoidable idea that the Sharif ruler has the ear of the British officials at his apparently not sorry to have the excuse that he cannot control a movement which will show his strength on the frontiers of Trans-Jordania and Iraq and which will demonstrate the danger of a rising which he can use as a political argument. get a meeting with someone from London to whom amongst other points he will reiterate his complaints that the whole trouble has been brought about by what he maintains is the incorrect attitude of Iraq. Our attack across the frontier has enabled him in his letters to shelve the quest* -ion of the attack on Busaiyah and to drag a red herring of our action against the treaties. tfecca sonner than he intended to avoid the constant press- -ure of his tribes to join openly with them. He desires to keep in with Great Britain but he must keep in with his -position but one which in the long run he can probably con -trol since Bedouin warfare unless held together from out- -side is apt to peter out. defence measures for we are in greater danger of raids than we were but we can hope the danger will not be maintained since without ammunition from Ibn Saud the tribes cannot continue attacks for long on a big scale. court Thus while he has to ride** the wave he is It may even be said that he has gone to tribes To do both is at the moment a difficult pro- In the meantime wo cannot relax our XiSSIiiSNTTelegram T. xxxxx vrom secretary of Gtate for the olonies.

Their general view is that in order to avert anything in the nature of a prolonged struggle it is desirable that special emissary should be placed in touch with Ibn Gaua at the areliest possible moment provided it can safely be done. It might be of advantage if the officer selected for the purpose is not directly connected with the recent controversy.

Reliable intelligence from 1 uwait shows (1) that Ibn Kumaid, with the Ataiba tribe are probably joining Dawish and preparing for raid starting about 7th March from neighbourhood of 8KA.GRA, whence they could not reach Iraq, frontier under one week. (2) that Ibn Baud disbanded force collected by the Governor of Hasa to attack the lutair on throat from Humaidf that if force was used against 1'utair he would support % Dawish (3) that Ibn Baud is distributing presents widely and generously presumably in order to retain the allegiance of tribes, but is giving arms to no one and ammunition only to Kumaid. (4) that there is no sign that the Ajman, from whom the main threat to Kuwait would come, are at present joining 15)S' @ ^3 (5) that the *jman tribesmen report that the Mutair are much depressed by casualties inflicted in air punishmen The conclusion appears to be that the main danger at present is from the Ataiba, whose attack would probably de directed against the Anezeh tribe, and that Ibn Gaud has not yet associated himself with raids but that he is (xm ?)able to do anything practical to restrain them. 2 HIGH COimiGSIONSE.Telegram P.

Nejd tribesmen have, accodtding to Hafiz Wahbah, accused Bin Sana of inciting the British offensive against Nejd. He earnestly reiterates his previous suggestion viz. that His Majesty’s Government should give Bin Saud a written assurance that if peace is restored and punishment inflicted by him the fort of Buxaiyah will be demolished. An assurance would also be necessary that if I bn Gaud takes punitive action against tribesmen and any of them fly to Iraq, or Kuwait we will surrender the fugitives to him. Vtith these two written assurances Hafiz ^ahba thinks Bin Gauci could get tribesmen under control and chastise Faisdl al Bawish and his followers. Hafiz Wahbah lays stress on urgency of action in the above sense. If they delay it may become impracticible. I have no sufficient local data to judge whether the two above mentioned assurances would indeed enable ibn Saud to recover control over the tribes- -men^ and punish the guilty. I can only estimate the situationsituation as viewed from Cairo. But if there is a fair chance that such would he the result itosm of these assur- -ances I think they should he considered. 4 - t hnvfl -roGGived from j-olitical Resident, Persian Gulf, it wouM appear that gravity of situation has already decided His Majesty's Government to notify Ihn Gaud of their intention to suspend air action which as has so dangerously excited :'ejd tribes.

Air Council are anxious to authorise Loyal Air v orce in Trans-Jordan to carry out reconnaiss- -ance flights for from 70 to 100 miles into Nejd territ- -ory. They represent that unless this authority is given raiders, who can move 50 to 70 miles in a night, can assemble on ia other xi&amp;ax frontier and be v»ell into Titans-Jordan by daylight before they can be found. I appreciate force of considerations raised by Air Council but there is objection to infringe- -ment by Royal Air Torce of Nejd Trans-Jordan frontier as recognised by Hadda agreement unless clearly justified by recent violations of frontier by Nejd tribes. So far as my information goes no such violations have taken place. Putting ourselves in the wrong if we were tn first to take initiative in crossing. Further con- -sideration is that extension to Trans-Jordan of sphere of active conflict with Ikhwan may finally destroy all possibility of an early settlement with Ibn Saud. Above summarises political arguments which appear to me to, tell strongly against Air BinistrylS proposal. .hether local situation is such that political arguments must give way to military necessit- -ies is question which I must leave to you or your dis- -cretion. If you consider circumstances to be such as to necessitate action proposed by Air Minister in spite of political objections you may authorise Loyal Air fforee to proceed, accordingly. 3 :GR'.'TKm OF 3TAT S.

Can we toake it app- -ear not as a weakness or if as a weakness as one done out of our strength and as a concession to our friend Ihn oaud ? The question is largely one for Irag to consider with an open mind. The object of the Busaiyah fort and the other forts projected is to maintain peace on the frontier.

I am doubtful whether in the present circumstances the Bahrain - Riyadh route would be advisable and 1 agree with Iraq that area away from Wahabi centre is desirable, indeed I am doubtful if in present excited condition of their minds anything else would be possible. The point will be to get Ibn Saud to Jeddah in existing circumstances, but with of position I think it may be possible provided we give him something to spread amongst the tribes both to calm them and as a reason for going to see our emissary.

Letter from Ibn Sa’ud received in which he expresses regret at r/hat has happened, recapitulating events and stating that while the Mutair were acting in a way of which he could not approve, at no time were they beyond power in his own country, that he had Dawish ringed and boycotted with his food supplies stopped so that he had to try and get food at Kuwait, but that the conduct of the 'Iraq people in invading his country and bombing Innocent and guilty alike had forced his hand, had made it impossible for him to finish punishment he was ready to inflict, he regretted that the impatient ones had got out of his control and v were proceeding somewhere out of his ken, 6 e ss That he had now information as to what was happen- ing there /V? A?- fear they should be included in the bombing. That the only way that lie could see out of the difficulty was (l) the maintenance of the 'Ufqair Protocol and the destruction of Busaiyah; {2) the mutual refusal to shelter * criminals; (j) the prevention of officials from mixing with the tribes and causing sedition; and (\) the British Government to hold responsible those who had caused the happenings on the 'Iraq frontier and punish them. That he agrees that a settlement could better be reached by conversation with the Resident than by correspondence, and that if the Resident saw no objection to the meeting even at a time that he was unable to arrest the reoel8,who are headstrong, he was ready to fix a time and place for a meeting to resolve the present difficulties.

I agree that there can h© no question of admitt* -ing that the Government of Iraq have in any way infringed treaty obligations nor is there any intention of negotiat- -ing a new treaty 'between Iraq and Nojd or of amending the existing agreements, but it is clearly in the interest of both States that the misunderstanding as to the meaning of iT the phrase M in vicinity of border” in Article III of Uqair f Protocol should be cleared up and a definition of words agreed upon in an exchange of notes. I would suggest that the words might be defined as meaning within an a»ea of (say) twenty miles from common frontier or from limits of neutral zone. Moreover, if we are to have a satisfactory and lasting settlement with Ibn Sand something will probably have to be done to save his face by giving him some apparent concession. I would suggest that when defining the meaning of Article III as above it might be intimated to Ibn Baud that there would be no objection to his construct- -ing posts similar to the Iraq posts at Busaiyah and Salman on the Nejd side of the frontier. I should be glad to have your comments on the above suggestions as soon as possible. You will realise that there would be little object in sending Claytor entirely or any other British emissary to Ibn Gaud with^empty hands. ms.

No. 40-T Hepeatod Dated 15th March 1928 Your telegram No. 124 and Baghdad telegram No. 144 With imminence of raids and present general position it is doubtful whether Ibn Baud can do anything to alter matters for the moment but it stands out that he is still the ruler of Nejd and local Arabs refuse to believe that the Akhwan can stand without him. King Faisal said to me at Baghdad that the difficulty of Ibn Saud^ position lay in his attempting at the same time to rule a people by means of fanaticism and to maintain relations with civilised peoples on his frontiers. This difficulty has at the moment forced his hand. has no desire for this raid as such and that he wishes to support of this it is confirmed from several sources that he had definitely collected men to punish Faisal bin Dawish and I also have information that when the Shaikhs of Shargah and of Has al Khaimah sent and went respectively to him with complaints he replied that these matters con- -cerned the British Government. It appears to me still as always that the basis of all argument with Ibn Saud and of all our action on maintain relations with the British Government The necessity of an emissary to him is greater than it ever was. It is clear that Ibn Saud In/*\ /^v 0 ) on our part as Ion?, as his treaties exist is that the Kuler of *)aj&amp; must prevent raids and he responsih].© for all losses incurred if raids occur. The result of present anti- -cipated raid will show if the above argument is tenable. 1 think it will be so notwithstanding his apparent inability to prevent this raid. If however this is incorrect the treaties ±n are in this respect useless and new ones must be made per- -mitting defensive forts on frontiers. jiy the time that Clayton reaches Ihn Saud the present crisis will be over and thus no concessions to meet present troubles but a permanent adjustment will be required. As regards Article III of the l{qair treaty I do not think any mileage can be stated but the nearest wells to frontier would he those indicated. Ihn Baud refers to wells used by his people: these would have to be determined and defined and equally those used and required hy Iraq. If tribes suffer heavily in this present raid task of readjustment will he easier. BBSIDHTT.Telegram From To Hepeatod No. 135. iu //f . ocretax*y of Gtate for tUe Colonies, London.

C/84 dated 5th Ramazan 1346 (26th February 1928) contain ing the telegram received by you from the Hon’ble the Poli tical Resident in the Persian Gulf for transmission to mo. Ac request you to communicate our following reply to the said telegram to the Hon'ble the Political Resident quick ly to enable him to forward it to H.B.M’s Government by the quickest medium. We regret for the extent to which the present state of affairs has reached as a result of the continued viola tion of our treaties by those who are in Iraq and it ap pears that up to this moment we see that the essence of the matters we have broached to H.B.M’s Government in res pect of the present state of affairs is being avoided. We therefore here sum o^ our previous observations on the contents of the latest reply from H.B.M’s Government: 1. The tribesmen of Mutair are not all guilty and it is not an acknowledged fact that Dawish had got out of control or that he had announced his insubordination against us. In fact Dawish in company with a few men of the Mutair tribesmen did deeds in the Iraq territory which were not according to our orders, nor do we acknowledge them. But Dawish in our country is under our orders and authority at all times. 2. H.M’s Government ask us for assurance in taking steps to punish the Dawish and prevent raids. It is very strange to receive such a demand again while we have al ready assured the British Government (in our previous let ter te which we request that a reference may be made) befere transgressiens were made by those in Iraq upon our territories by using British aeroplanes. And as a result ef the measure we teok all transgressiens were breught tean end. Ag a further result of our steps taken against the Dawiah he was forced not to make further raids and to settle in his own country. He was beycotted by all the Nejd people and blocxaded by the Government (the Uejd Gov ernment) which prevented supplies of foodstuffs reaching him or being sent to him. Hence had had no ether alterna tive but te write to the huler of Kuwait in order to ar range with him ”i!/iusabilah' te purchase his supplies from Kuwait. Ve have not given hawish the last blew to retalia te for all he has dene as were awaiting the result of the negotiations as we have already mentioned. In spite of all these measures about which the British Government knew quite in time those in Iraq did not step doing what their aspirations actuated them te do rather than settling dif ficulties by the best method. They on the other hand en croached and committed heinous acts from which human hearts shudder. They bombed Aneza the Harb and L&gt;hammar within eur north western limits and bombed others in eur north eastern limits and all those who are bombed were innocent persons. 3. The principle which is rementiened in the last let ter and which was mentioned in seme of the previous letters and which makes the British Government give the right of pursuing or punishing the Nejd subjects within Hejd terri tory by the officials of the Iraq Government or any other authority in the world (ether than by Hejdian) for whatever crime that the Hejd people may have committed in any part of the world. This principle is net admitted by an inter national law and is not allowed by the Bahra and Jeddah Treaties. It is a principle whidh we oanmet admit te be legal in any manner whatever.

Aq a result of the warnings of the aero planes and their bombing our territories and their bombing our soldiers who were guarding the frontiers we had to withdraw the garrison on the frontier because it was diffi cult for us to soe our soldiers engaged in fighting the British Mr korce. After we withdrew our soldiers from the frontier zones our information of the happen^ings and activities of tribesmen in those parts very much decreased. 5, The British Government demanded from us to take the responsibility upon our shoulders in order that they sheuld stop their measures that they were taking. »e have inferm- ed the Gevernment previously that we were prepared to take such a responsibility upon our shoulders of protecting the Iraq frontiers on three conditions and which we repeat here and add a fourth one to them which has cropped up as a result of the last misconduct. They run as under I. That the protocol of Uqair should be honouredp and the ill-omened fort at Busiyah should be demolished and none be built on the frontiers, II. That we undertake mutually with the Iraq Government not to shelter any criminals that will take refugo from one of the two countries in tho territories of the other. III. That officials sheuld be prevented frero mining with eur tribesmen and instigating them to run away and cause sedition. IV. That the British Government should take steps t© held responsible these persons who caused the happenings en the Iraq frontiers and punish them for what they had committed. Unless these feur conditiens are fulfilled I do not see any way for stepping the present excitement. On reference teIt? all that we have written and explained t* the British Government about the exact fact of the situation it w^uld clearly De seen that what we have proposed is the only ef fective remedy for these troubles and that is by which all rights and undertakings can be fulfilled• That the settlement of these affairs can better be reached by conversation with the H©n'ble the Political Resident than by correspondence is a thing we agree upon.

Political Resident's telegram No. 47-T. Following points emerge from Ihn Baud's * letter (a) He has no intention himself of declaring jehad. W (h) He alleges that iUTAIR at all events are out of his control. (c) Still alleges indiscriminate homhing of innocent and guilty as reason for his inability to punish MUTAIR. (d) He hints that further raids on Mesopotamia will take place as 'impatient ones are proceeding somewhere.' (e) He further hints that such raids will continue unless his four demands are acceded to. (f) He appears to imply that he is not going to Kejaz otherwise he would hardly have offered to meet the Resident. emphasise and keep on emphasising that there has Been no after raids of January 27th in Kuwait territory and of -uary and 2nd February a few bombs were dropped in the Nejd territory in order to frighten them into obey warn- beings were hit but only four or five camels killed.

Government cannot accept this vide pages 7 and 72-74 of Clayton*l f Report, fiddle Hast No, 7. (3) Remand for prevention of officials mixing with tribes is unintelligible unless it either amounts to demand that Iraq officials shall not travel in desert zone to keep in touch with their own tribes or to reiteration of allegation that RAIIAllgllAH of ARARAT afi properly a Nejd tribe ana that Iraq officials, should not correspond with them even when in Iraq territory. This has fully and repeatedly been dealt with in correspondence ending with my letter to Ibn Saud :o, 8,0.279 of 3rd February 1928, copy forwarded with my despatch Secret A of 3rd February. (4) The demand is of course absurd as the bombing ini in Nejd territory was suggested by H.L*s. Government themselves. I fear therefore that whoever meets Ibn Saud will find himself confronted by deadlock as he can only repeat arguments already repeated for years. The principal result to be hoped for from is the meeting wisdtxjbie that Ibn Saud will be convinced that H.f *s. Government cannot accept his demands as now stated and that the consequence of the continuinance of the present state of things will be serious both for himself and his tribes.

I bn Gaud's letters are special pleading and t do not represent finality. U) I have always been of the opinion that he / approved of a demonstration against Busaiyah to strengthen his political case of difficulty of restraining tribes hut that destruction of fort and killing of garrison put him in wrong position. His continued objection to fort and the provocation it gave his tribes is his best defence against Lis responsibility for attack on it f which is otherwise indefensible. (3) His desire to prevent shelter of political criminals is understandable if impossible and point can only be met by conversation. (3) He probably refers to Faisal’s intrigues, which we know have taken place. If we can satisfy him that these do not have the countenance of British officials in Iraq, without actually admitting that they have taken place we shall probably satisfy him. Both sides intrig- -ua. Oriental diplomacy without intrigue is a contra- -diction in terms. '(4) He knows perfectly well that bombing could not have taken place without the sanction of His Majesty’s Government. His object is fairly obviously to have a bolt hole. If we do not punish the people who crossed his frontier how can he punish his people for doing the® / 3 &lt;£ same thing ? He naturally slurs the point that his tribes Grossed the frontier and attacked Iraqi. Face to ^ lace this point would he pushed home every time he attemptec to evade it. Ibn Gaud is however Dictator of Nejd. If WM. some tribes have got out of hand it is only temporarily. The Ikhwan are practically his regular army. They depend on him for their money, food, clothes and even the clothing of their women. .ithout him they have no ammunition and must raid in Hejd for a living. Unless they get tired of him and murder him he is the dominant factor in the country. Thus as long as he is there no one fclse can maintain order and with him only can we deal. e must recognise him. Thus it is worth meeting him and deciding (luostions but in doing so we must also recognise his diff- -icultios without allowing him to bluff us with them. Hence my endorsing Cairo*s suggestion vide y my telegram 8-T of 10th^ ?Jarch that if he would accept full responsibility wo should if Iraq could agree dispense with the new forts. otherwise forts are obviously necessary. But conversation with him will clear this point. In the meantime Bin Gaud may write accepting the invitation to Jeddah but his letter and present circum* -stances do not suggest that he could do this in the immed- -iata future nor would conversation there do much good if he did not know what was happening here. I now think that with all the evidence at hand a meeting on this di&amp;e would be better. If you have not decided to sana Clayton I would suggest that I should hold meeting this side with Bourdillon present with watching brief to represent Iraq. I would try and get Ibn Gaud to Ujair, would have wireless set on launch and would be in immediate touch with you and HIGH Commissioner.

(7.2.28) From Abd el kziz ibn Abdurraiua&amp;n al Faiaal To His Excellency the British Agent and Coneul 9 Jiddah. After greetings and reepects 9 We hare received your letter dated the 16th January, 1928, lio, 40/40/9 and were much gratified at the friendly spirit expressed by the British Government to meet our desire to solve the difficulty between Us and 'Iraq and some questions in the Persian Gulf. We are also glad to note that they selected Colonel Haworth, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, to discuss with Us suoh questions. We wish that we could meet Colonel Haworth to eettle euoh questions, but it is regretted that the situation has changed since Our first letter and even since that to Your Excellency of the 2nd Shaaban (25*1*28). This wae due to the precipitation of officials * 'Iraqi and British * in 'Iraq. tion of the injustioe we have met with through the Britleh Government officials in 'Iraq and Transjordan pursuing the Bherlfs* policy which has produced and will etill produce and friendly relatione existing between Hajd and the Government of Great Britain. We will summarise as follows: (1) We wish to assure the British Government that we are, before everything, true to Oureelvee and u ur people and that suoh loyalty led Us into friendly relatione with the British Government from the commencement of Our political career being confident of the fact that they are true to their promisee and that they guard their intereeta which, ve believe, de not run counter to the interests of Our We therefore wish that you would convey ae soon as possible to His Majesty's Government the following conmunica- the worst results in neighbouring countries and in the good country• 2 • country and people. hare been true and firm in Our friendship as the British Oorernaent well knows. H would not allow Our confidence in the British Govurorient to lessen in spite of doubts occasioned by the actions which we will plainly set forth in this letter. ttajd entertained friendly relations with the British Government. Bajd is, as all people and the Arabs know, the heart of Arabia, the protector of the race, its religion, character and credit anO known ae such to all wise Arabs. The Turks and M. Hussein worked against hajd but everything was discovered and the menace to hajd removed. The Arabs got in touch with Bajd but h&amp;jd would not permit any intervention on the part of other Arabs lest relations with the British Government might be impaired. The attitude of the British Government with the Gherifs, however, gave rise to doubts among the people Of iiajd. These can be summarised as follows. (2) After Faisal*s arrival in ’Iraq the treaty of SI Muhamraerah was forwa rded to bs and We refused it believing that the * Iraq people had no frontiers behind Ks Bhutt, but that all the Arabs behind Ghutt, JGz Dhafir and Gniza etcet era have always been in submission to the Governor of Bajd. The people of ’Iraq used to pay *K 1 Khawa* (tax?) to Ba^d for crossing such frontiers both in the days of Gur forefathers, of A! Br Baahid and in Our own days. At the meeting of Uqair, in asking Us to recognise some frontiers they had decided upon, the British Government were considerate, sympathetic, difficult or even threatening by turns. Although unsatisfied We accepted the frontiers on a ondition I- f• 3 •* *r condition that crinking from the water should bo free and that building over the wells and the neighbouring plaoeo should be prohibited. The rueetlng left be with the impreeolon that Britain inclined towards the 1 Iraq side rather than to Cure. (3) Faisal In * Iraq prepared parties of bhammar and others against Uo till ®ur country was about to become a prey to their plunder. We protested and had a reply, but none of the guilty were puni»hsd by imprisonment, beating or warning and no robbed property was returned to its owners. Abdullah did the some thing In Transjordan and there came the agreement of Bahra and Hadda, but raids against Us never stopped. Neither did We find the British officials in f Iraq and Transjordan so enthusiastic in defending v ur right to h&amp;va the criminals punished as they were in their defence of 1 Iraq, a defence which can only mean aggression of our country and homes. We, on Our part, have killed a number of Our subjects for the sake of ’Iraq and have restored to the 1 Iraq Govern- merit part of the robbed property. Those whom were punishing ran away to * Iraq and where they were welcomed as the British officials saw and observed. (4) That passed, and then came the trouble over the infraction of the third clause of the Uqair .Protocol, we protested and notified those in 'Iraq of the consequent rssult^. They did not give our protest a listening ear,but delayed the reply too long so that one of Gur subjects, ^ Bowelsh, started committing the acts that the Transjordan and 1 Iraq Arabs repeatedly committed against °ur Arabs right up to the time of id Boweish 9 s raids against 'Iraq. We have restrained the people of ttajd and compelled them to be patient and to hats the action of £d Doweish who has been whas been treated In the most cruel manner and besieged from all directions. the only action for punishing hi* *• delayed is the sending out of an expedition against him. We delayed carrying out that until we could coae to an agreement to the effect that if a criminal runs away to 1 IreQ he will not be accepted there. (5) Affairs became quiet and calm, and then the briti*ii Government threatened Us that they will punish '-'ur subjects within Our frontiers. We explained to them the bad results of tuch action and that We were prepared to discuss the question of settling the difficulty by negotiation and that there was no need for ouch action. The 1 Iraq Vernier then declared that he wished to causa an expedition to advance against hajc, but We gave no heed to his statement, confident that as all those in ’Iraq well know, an advance towards U&amp;jd will only result in the same way as the action of the Turks when they advanced with the people of 'Iraq and their Arabs, Uhammar, Xbn Kashid and Syrian and Palestinian troops; and hajd was surrounded from all sides, from the Persian Gulf, ’Iraq, Hijas and Yemen. The said expedition returned by the grace of God 'md with His help. We do not think the officials in 'Iraq will take such risks. (6) We heard on the 9th Shaaban that aeroplanes dropped procInflations onOur frontiers warning Our subjects to withdraw four days distance from the frontiers as aeroplanes would drop bombs in that area. ( 7 ) On the 11th Oh&amp;aban we heard that aeroplanes had dropped bombs on Our soil and on Our frontiers on ealm and peaceful subjects, thus carrying out the wishes of those in * Iraq, satisfying their thirst for rancour and wreaking the revenge In their hearts against innocent and peaceful people. Such action^uoh action broug ht about (l) a^greselon against Our independence, (2) injury of peaceful and quiet people, (3) the lighting the fire of disturbance anew in liajd, and, ( 4 ) caused the friend of Britain who ie trying to lessen diffloultleii and who ie working for peeoe and e&amp;lnneee in the Arabian Peninsular to be placed Ira a faloe position in the eye* of Hie nation and people. The people of liajd, after such actions, began to have doubts about Us, that We are deoeiTing them, while We are only one of them and sharer of their joys and sorrows. Can such results be considered satisfactory by our friend the British Government for the sake of the hatred of Pais&amp;l and Abdullah in * Iraq and Transjordan ? Were *e not desirous not to Impair the British Government’s political procedure, We would have actually shown them the standing of those two men among the Af&amp;bs. Let the British Government close their eyes a little and they will see how the face of the Arab countries will alter after a short time* Wo do not wish to be exalted or to act unjustly, but V?e require Our religion anti honour to be safe in Our country. For the Insult which has befallen Uy and the B&amp;jd people through the latest action of the British officials in 'Iraq, that disgraceful and reprehensible action, was the greatest blow to the friendly relations between Bajd and Britain.

It seems most unlikely that attack will now take place but if tribes begin to move we should have ample news of fckrxx* their intention. Also Ibn Gaud will have seen them and presumably he would now himself warn us if their intentions seemed hostile. Thus as long as one sloop remains at Kuwait and the other in the north of the Gulf with the cruiser within 24 hours recall I think we can with safety agree to dispersion of Navy from Kuwait if you agree.

I trust the following observations will not he considered heyond my province. I feel assured that Ihn 3aud is even more anxious for peace than we are. Present unsettled con- -ditions contain seed of danger to him and I am certain that a mixture of sympathy with firmness will produce result that we require. But it is necessary that neither we nor he should forget that origin of trouble was the attack on Busaiyah and that he is quite wrong in his belief that no wells exist between that place and the frontier. Thus the whole groundwork of his contention is without foundation and he has no right to object to the existence of the fort or to demand its not being occupied. Its destruction now might be misunderstood. While we desire that Ibn Gaud should rule ana should control his tribes we cannot forget that he, and still more so his tribes, are Orientals and that therefore if we find it assists our object to meet him in any way ( for instance that the fort should not bo occupied to enable him to show that he can control his tribes) it is necessary that he should completely realise that it is a friendly gift from our strength to strengthen him for our common object and not a concession through weakness or a desire to placate tribes of whom we are afraid. I(&amp; Xb! I have 'been strongly against any crossing of his frontier for punishment of tribes until I bn 3aud himself had failed mainly because I considered this policy was wrong as policy unless we were forced to it by cognate circumstances but also because I realised that it assisted Ibn Hand to obscure the main issue viz. his own responsib ility towards us. As long as we desire to hold him responsib le for Arabia it is necessary for us to strengthen him not to weakeii him, but in doing so we must pin him to the underlying groundwork of omr policy which, as far as the present issue is concerned, is his responsibility for the actions of his tribes. This line of argument may result in certain modifications on his stating his difficulties but such modifications should be to a common end and be clear in their intention. It may also be stressed that raiding is largely economic and part of the normal life of the tribes, thus only man who can prevent it is Ibn 3aud. I still think that a Frontier Commission of an officer from us and one from Ibn Saud ( which officer from us should not be the Political Agent, Kuwait) to watch the frontier and adjudicate would be worth the money until the frontier becomes more settled.Telegram From To liepeated Ko. 1X88.

I think It is a good thing that this last section of Armoured Care is leaving Kuwait now, as there is little or no fear of any further trouble from the Ikhwan for the next few months. There is no doubt whatever that the Shaikh and the great majority of the people of Kuwait are really grateful for the protection which we have given the*, k theory, apparently started by some “poll tic Ians” in ’Ira&lt;», that we never voluntarily leave a place we go to, and that our coming to Kuwait in the guise of protectors would cer tainly mean that we would take It over, found few supporter in Kuwait itself^ and it would indeed be a pity if ideas of this sort were to gain credence through our stopping on too long. I shall be very much interested to hear whether this move means that some satisfactory news has been re- celved regarding the Jiddah Conference. Personally X sn -lj. be extremely surprised if an agreement is arrived at - and still more if it is kept - unless we are prepared to give Ibn Sa’ud a subsidy. The fact that Xbn Humaid and Dawish refused to meet him in Buraidah shows that he has still no real authority over them, and I think he is too honest &amp; sian to agree to terms, the fulfilment of which he knows he cannot enforce. In my opinion the most economical policy would be to give him a subsidy, by msans of which he mightregain hia loot authority over the tribes. It would not */ to be very large, or permanent, and would aertainly be cheaper than continued Frontier operations similar to those of the last few months. Still, I hardly thinfc this is a polloy likely to appeal to His Majesty's Government. It is difficult to foretell what will happen if the Jlddah Conference does break down; Ibn 3a*ud will certainly avoid an open breach with us if he possibly can. I have heard a suggestion from Arab - or rather, from ‘Iraq - sources that he will probably try intriguing with some other European power, but I doubt if there is anything in that. As we are not likely to take any unprovoked action, it seems probable that, if no agreement la arrived at, or if Ibn 3a'ud agrees to terms which he cannot enforce, the desert will remain quiet until the autumn, and that raids similar to those of the past spring will start again then. I consider ahy renewal of raiding in the near future improbable, not only because of the difficulty of moving large parties when grasing and water is scarce, but because the grazing is so bad further south that it is of vital importance to the Mutair that they be allowed to remain in peace round Hafar, etc., for the next month or two, and it would be easy for us to prevent this if active operations were in progress# The Shaikh of Kuwait is certainly not optimistic about the future. Hot only is he very anxious to get the Machine Guns and Lewis Guns referred to in my telegram No.^6 of t?th May, but he is strengthening the town wall, and has just completed one new tower on it, which I understand Is only the first of several.
