The memoranda stress the need for economy in the use of paper and other stationery by all government employees due to war-time conditions, which had caused domestic shortages in paper production, increased costs and difficulty in securing imported stationery requisites. The memoranda announce a reduction in stationery budgets and provide detailed practical instructions for staff about how to both limit their use of stationery and reduce their need for government printing and publications.The file also contains Office Order No.11 dated 6 February 1942, compiled and circulated by the Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to all Residency and Agency staff in the region. This document contains detailed instructions on the economic use of paper and other stationery by local staff, when carrying out their normal duties.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Office services</topic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Stationery</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0000d9#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
