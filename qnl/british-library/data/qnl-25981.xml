For this purpose they found it convenient to revive the ancient Zoroastrian feast of Mehrgan, which occurs in the Persian calendar on a day close to that on which the party was formed five years ago. There are many myths and legends about the feast of Mehrgan but the oldest seem to associate it with the completion of the divine creation of the world and the inspiration of mankind with the spirit of God. The party organisers have, however, been at pains to make it clear that they attach no religious significance to the festival but wish it to be observed solely as a national political anniversary. 2. The celebrations began on 2nd October with a luncheon party to foreign journalists, followed the next day by an evening reception attended by the Prime Minister, members of the Cabinet, senior officers of the services and the principal officials of the various ministries. On Friday, 4th October, there was a mass meeting of the party and of workers’ unions in the main square of the capital, which was well organised and orderly. A special 10-page edition of Rahbar, official press organ of the party, was published to commemorate the anniversary and the editor claims that 120,000 copies were sold. All members were urged to subscribe one day’s pay to party funds. 3. The occasion is appropriate for a brief review of the present position of the Tudeh Party. During the early months of the current year, after the formation of the Government of Qavam al Sultaneh, the strength and influence of the party developed rapidly, but during the last three months it has encountered set-backs in spite of the inclusion of three Tudeh leaders in the Cabinet at the beginning of August. 4. In the province of Khuzistan (which includes the A.I.O.C.’s oilfields and installations at Abadan) most of the party’s agitators have for the time being been banished or shut up and martial law has imposed severe restrictions on party activities of all kinds; in Shiraz and Isfahan also, martial law has been declared with discouraging consequences for the party’s organisations. In Kerman the Tudeh has been curbed and though still active in Meshed it is faced there with persistent opposition from the Persian Democrat Party. In Gilan and Mazandaran the “oppression ' exercised by Government officials is the subject of constant complaint in the Tudeh press. 5. On the other side of the account must be entered the sustained vigour of the party headquarters in Tehran, the vitality of its chief organs of publicity, the Tehran newspapers Rahbar and Zafar and its eight provincial journals, the efforts of the Minister of Education (Dr. Kishawarz), through his numerous nominees, to teach the Marxist gospel in the schools throughout the country. Many party men have also been appointed to work in the Ministries of Health and Commerce and Industry. The Tudeh Party is well organised, resourceful and full of fight and determination and may well succeed in overcoming the official opposition which at present bars the way to further expansion.

Copies of this despatch are being sent to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Moscow and Bagdad, Air Headquarters, Iraq, British Middle East Office, Political Intelligence Centre Middle East, Government of India and all con sulates in Persia. ' ’ ir '“ ■' Report on Events in Persia during the Three Months ended 3(PA September, 194ft DEVELOPMENTS during the period under review have confirmed the determination of the Government of the U.S.S.R. to expand its influence and that of the Communist Party throughout Persia. The principal .developments were the formation of a new Cabinet to include members of the Tudeh Party and various political manoeuvres in preparation for the general elections; inconclusive negotiations with the newly-constituted authorities of Azerbaijan; disorders in the concessionary areas of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and unrest amongst the Arabs of Khuzistan; a tribal revolt in the south; spasmodic affrays and negotiations with rebellious Kurds; the precautionary visit of British warships to the Shatt-el-Arab and the concentration of British troops at Basra; violent Persian reactions to these measures; and a continuous press campaign against His Majesty’s Government, British officials and British interests in general in Persia, culminating in a request for the withdrawal of His Majesty’s Consul- General at Ahwaz. The most immediate objective of the U.S.S.R. is to bring about the election of a Majlis which will be disposed to co-operate in every way with the Soviet Union and in particular to ratify the Perso-Russian oil concession in North Persia as agreed by the Prime Minister Qavam-es-Saltaneh, when he visited Moscow in the spring. Early in July the Prime Minister launched a new political party, to be known as the Democrat Party of Persia, with a programme to cover all fields of internal reforms and a foreign policy which was to have good relations with all friendly Powers, provided that the sovereignty and independence of Persia are respected and that there is no interference with the internal affairs of the country in the name of friendship or on the pretext of protecting Persian independence. This party has not attracted very general support amongst prominent Persians, though lip-service has been paid to it bv Government officials, and by various influential tribal chieftains. The leading members of the party, in particular Muzaffar Firuz, whom the Prime Minister permits to pose as its chief protagonist, do not inspire confidence. The reply of the Tudeh Party to this was to form a United Front by fusion with a former group known as the Iran Party. At the beginning of August, Qavam formed a coalition Government, in which leading members of the Tudeh Party were given the portfolios of Education, Health and Commerce, while a new Ministry of Labour and Propaganda was established under the unpopular Muzaffar Firuz, who had formerly been Political Under-Secretary of State and assistant to the Prime Minister. An official state ment of the aims of the new Government placed a ban on contact by Persians with foreign embassies or consulates, who were asked to co-operate. No official I have, &amp;c. J. H. LE ROUGETEL. Enclosure [ 83 — 40 ]•vrg'T;- --rw- 2 communication was made to any foreign mission on the subject of the ban and therefore no cognizance has been taken of it by this embassy, but instructions were given to consuls in the provinces to exercise increased discretion in their contacts with Persians. The boycott has been observed by the Persians in some towns and not in others. Before and since the reorganisation of the Cabinet, the Prime Minister has carried out a series of arrests of extremists, both Right-wing and Left-wing, and of personal enemies accused of plotting against his Government. These included the Minister for Commerce, who was said to have arranged, without the knowledge of Qavam, for the Shah’s sister to visit Moscow. Further arrests followed the discovery of the intended revolt of the Bakhtiari and Kashgai tribes. The persons arrested included Bakhtiari Khans and the General Officer Com manding in Khuzistan, whose treatment by the civil authorities led to the resigna tion of the Minister for War and of the Chief of General Staff, subsequently withdrawn after a public apology had been made by the Prime Minister. In July, after a short strike at the Agha Jari oilfield and a partial strike at Abadan, called by local Tudeh leaders, a general strike was declared on the 14th throughout the A.I.O.C. area, the ostensible reason for which was a demand for Friday pay. Trouble was also stirred up by the Communists amongst the Indian artisans in Abadan. In spite of the declaration of martial law by the Governor-General of Khuzistan, under instructions from Tehran, the strike went on for three days, during which serious clashes occurred in Abadan between the members of the local Tudeh Party and Arabs. There were casualties on both sides, but especially among the Arabs, and two Arab contractors were deliberately murdered and dismembered. Little damage was caused to company property or installations, but a state of extreme alarm was caused. It was evident that the whole outbreak was of a political nature and not a genuine labour dispute. Moreover, all the points at issue between the management of the A.I.O.C. and the workers were under discussion in Tehran before a Government Commission set up under the new labour law which expressly prohibits strikes without prior reference to the commission. Production of oil was brought temporarily to a standstill. As a result of these events, H.M.S. Norfolk and H.M.S. Wild Goose were ordered to lie off Abadan in the Shatt-el-Arab after previous notification to the Persian Government who immediately protested, stating that if the arrival of these vessels was connected with the strike it would be considered an unfriendly act. A violent press campaign was also launched against His Majesty’s Government. In view of the likelihood of further trouble in the oilfields and refinery, it was subsequently decided to send an Indian Brigade Group to Basra. This was announced by the Government of India in a broadcast from New Delhi on the 3rd August, which stated that the force was for the protection of Indian, British and Arab lives in South Persia, should circumstances require. The announce ment called forth an immediate protest from the Persian Government and another outburst in the press. The return of the troops to India was demanded, since adequate security measures had already been taken by the Persian authorities, and in any case the strike was considered to be an internal affair not calling for armed foreign intervention. The Persian Government were informed that there was no truth in the report that orders had been given for these troops to enter Persia and soothing assurances were given to the Prime Minister to the effect that the firm action taken by the Persian provincial authorities during the recent disturbances was greatly appreciated and that His Majesty’s Government had every confidence in the intention of the Persian Government to prevent further disorder. The Governor-General of Khuzistan, armed with special powers bv the Government, had, in fact, acted to the best of his ability in a most satis factory manner in the teeth of strong opposition from those under the influence of the Tudeh Party. In fact, the arrival of British reinforcements probably strengthened the Prime Minister’s hand in dealing with the agitators besides having a beneficial effect on the morale of the staff of the oil company A Government commission was sent to Abadan to investigate the causes of the riots It was composed of persons of strong pro-Tudeh sympathies who devoted themselves to manufacturing evidence to prove that the A I O C and British agents were responsible for the disorders and for the organising of Arab resistance to the Central Government and hostility to the Tudeh Party \ s none of the persons arrested had been punished and some of them had been released by the end of August, a protest was made to the Prime Minister and he was asked that the venomous press campaign against the company and the British which3 had continued unabated since the time of the strike in most ot the Tehran and provincial papers, should be stopped. It has increased in violence since then, jpari passu with Moscow radio and the Soviet press. The labour law referred to above provided for the organisation of trade unions and for commissions to decide on minimum wages, labour disputes, workers’ welfare funds and other social benefits. The Labour Counsellor of His Majesty’s Embassy in Cairo has paid two visits to Persia during the past three months and has assisted, along with representatives of the A.I.O.C., at meetings of the commission to fix wages and allowances and later in the deliberation of the Supreme Labour Council, which first met during September. Mr. Audsley has also helped the Ministry of Labour in drafting trade union regulations. It has been announced that three French experts aie to be employed by the Ministry to work out schemes for workers’ welfare funds. All this is looked upon with some misgiving by the Minister for Finance, since increases of wages on a large scale cannot but lead to inflation and increased cost of living, and the necessary currency is not available. Moreover, the Treasury has had to ask for an advance of £1 million from royalties payable by the A.I.O.C. to finance purchase by the Government of this year’s grain crops, and other means are being devised to try to force the Imperial Bank of Iran, and other banks who are much less affected to deposit without interest with the Banki Melli a percentage of their public current deposits and to take up Government securities in order to finance public works. Efforts have continued throughout the period under review to clear up out standing differences with the Azerbaijan Administration. These are in the main, the control and organisation of the armed forces to be maintained in the province and the evacuation by the Azerbaijanis of the town and district of Zendjan. A delegation has been in Tehran for some time, but their efforts have been abortive. For practical purposes Azerbaijan is independent of the Central Government. Tehran newspapers are not allowed to circulate in Tabriz and strict control is exercised over the movements of all travellers to and from the province. The Tabriz Administration has its own internal difficulties with the Kurdish Com mittee in Mahabad. The Kurds do not acknowledge the jurisdiction of Tabriz and there has been friction between the two as to who should control Rezaieh. The Kurdish nationalist movement and the unsettled state of affairs in Kurdish Azerbaijan have made it necessary for the Persian Government to keep a division of troops in the Senneh-Saqqiz area for defensive purposes. The extent of con cessions made to Azerbaijan has led to imitative demands from other parts of Persia. Requests for provincial autonomy have been put forward in Khuzistan, Pars, Isfahan and Kurdistan. In Khuzistan the movement was aggravated after the strike at Abadan in which, as already described, Arabs were the victims of Tudeh savagery. It subsequently found expression in appeals against Persian tyranny to the Iraqi Government and to the Arab League. Early in August a mutual defence pact was signed between the Bakhtiari and Kashgai Khans aimed against the Tudeh Party, though professing loyalty to the Government in Tehran. It became known during the middle of the month that they were plotting to seize Isfahan and Shiraz to destroy the Tudeh organisation in both centres and thus to forestall the possibility of a general election which would in all probability put that party in power. At the beginning of September the two joint Governors of Bakhtiari were summoned to Tehran and His Majesty’s Consul at Isfahan reported that this certainly meant that the tribal plans were known, that the seizure of Isfahan was unlikely to succeed as the Bakhtiari, who had asked for British assistance, were almost without arms and that it was doubtful whether the revolt would take place. One of the Khans answered the summons and divulged the whole plot to Muzaffar Firuz, who then told a press conference that Abul Qasim Khan Bakhtiari had all the time been acting as a stool-pigeon for the Government and listening in to the conspiracy. However this may be, Firuz fled to Isfahan and arrested the other Governor of Bakhtiari and various members of his family. Martial law was declared in Isfahan and there has been no more trouble there. Firuz extracted “ confessions ” from certain of the persons arrested, which were alleged to implicate certain British officials. On the 31st August, martial law was proclaimed in Shiraz. Khosro Khan Kashgai was called to Tehran by Firuz and was informed of the allegations of Abul Qasim Khan. After the arrest of the Bakhtiari leaders, he was again summoned to Isfahan, but his brother went instead and the Minister for Labour threatened to send a force of Caucasians against the Kashgai. The tribes of Fars, however, proceeded with their plans and on the 20th September it wasx — CT—, reported that the Kashgai under Naser Khan were waiting to take Shiraz. They had also formed an alliance with the tribes of the Persian Gulf who were prepared to occupy Bushire. The Governor-General of Kerman, who is a former Deputy for Shiraz, and the Governor-General of Pars were instructed to negotiate with Naser Khan, who demanded the release of the Bakhtiari leaders, removal of Government officials from the province of Pars, dismissal of the Tudeh Ministers ^ from the Central Government and the arrest of the Tudeh Party leaders in Pars.* Further demands were telegraphed to Tehran, which aimed at local autonomy on the lines of Azerbaijan. The Persian Government seemed disposed to concede some of the demands and the punitive expedition, which had left Isfahan, was held at Abadeh. The Minister for War in the meantime asked the military attach^ of this embassy what policy His Majesty’s Government wished the Persian Government to take with regard to the tribes, but was told that his question had been referred to His Majesty’s Government. By the end of the month negotia tions had broken down. The Government delegation had returned to Tehran and the tribes were advancing towards Shiraz, which w r as surrounded by the rebels. Some days before Bushire had been cut off from the hinterland and severe fighting had taken place at Kazerun, the key-point on the Shiraz-Bushire road. Bushire surrendered to the rebels under Fathollah Haiyat Daoudi on 29th September, after a defence brought to an end by lack of water. The Persian Air Force took part in the proceedings, but the Persian navy unfortunately arrived too late. At the end of the month it was reported from Kermanshah that a sympathetic revolt with similar aims was on the point of breaking out in West Persia. The principal aims of His Majesty’s Government during this time have been to endeavour to neutralise Communist activities and to prevent political sabotage in the oilfield areas. Strong pressure has been maintained on the Prime Minister to suppress subversive activities in the oilfields and to ensure that legitimate labour disputes are settled in the proper legal manner. The Prime Minister has responded satisfactorily. Various appeals have also been made to him to control the Tudeh press, but this has proved beyond his power, though he has issued instructions to check abuse of foreign Powers in public speeches. Our publicity has aimed at influencing Persian public opinion in such a way that the full support of the Prime Minister could not be given to the Tudeh Party before the elections and that the advantage of genuine democratic and free institutions might be prefersed to the methods and principles of communism. While it has been made clear to the Persian Government that responsibility for security and for the protection of foreigners and their property and for removing agitators lies with them, it has also been pointed out to the A.LOG. that their labour policy requires overhauling. In addition to the assistance of Mr. Audsley in advising the Persian Govern ment, this embassy and the oil company on trade union and labour matters, the British Middle East Office in Cairo has arranged for visits during the past three months by Mr. Crawford, agricultural' expert, Mr. Pridfe, Health Counsellor, and Mr. Sinclair, Telecommunications Attache, who have given valuable advice to the competent departments of the Persian Government. Contracts have also been given to the British firm, Sir Alexander Gibb and Partner, for important irrigation schemes, and a provisional arrangement has been made under which the British Overseas Airways Corporation are authorised to operate services to Tehran. Hurricane fighter planes supplied to the Persian Air Force arrived together with technical experts for their erection and main tenance. Persian Army and Air Force personnel took part in the Victory Parade in London. Relations with countries other than Great Britain and U.S.S.R. have been of comparatively small importance. Endeavours were made to pick a quarrel with the Iraqi Government for alleged sympathy with Arab aspirations in South- West Persia. Both the U.S.S.R. and the United States were thanked for their assistance in obtaining a seat for Persia at the Paris Conference. The Prime Minister has expressed a hope that His Majesty’s Government will sponsor the application of Persia to become a full member of the Peace Conference for determining conditions of peace with Germany and Japan. The situation is thus most disturbed and the wisdom of having adequate forces at hand to protect our interests in South Persia if required has been amply proved, but whether the Prime Minister will succeed in maintaining his policy of “ balance ” is still an open question. 6[This telegram is of particular secrecy and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on.] CrpH^iVOTP CABffluT DISTRIBUTION FRGi, 1EHRAN TO 1DREIGN OFFICE Mr. Le Rougetel. ^ t , No. 1,969 . p.m. 4th December, 1946. 4th December, 1946.

The Prime Minister makes light of this warning and says that it was just what might have been expected but he fears Firuz is out for mischief. /He■ - 2 - He is particularly disturbed by two intercepted telegrams from Firuz to Javid in a cypher which is not held by the Persian Government. 3.

Article is headed: ’’They wish to make Persia a war base against the Soviet Union,” Imperialism of ximerica afraid of the failure of its plans seeks in every way to mislead the people of Persia on political and social questions. The policy of Byrnes, Churchill, and Bevin is directed by the E is or bowers and Montgomeries. American policy aims today at the military encirclement of the U.S.S.R. and the establishment of air, land and sea bases from which the U.S.S.R. can be attacked. Persia has a fecial importance for American warmongers. If they can establish air and military bases in Persia they can threaten directly the oilfields of the Caucasus and the factories of the Urals. The present so- called impartial Government of Persia has invited these enemies of our great and friendly neighbour to come from thousands of miles away and has placed the army and gendarmerie in their hands 0 The people of Russia suffered terribly in the last war u What reason have we to bring their enemies here to threaten them with new disasters?

It is contrary to the policy of His Majesty’s Government to interfere in Persian affairs but since I have bo ni asked for my views I believe that any Government is entitled to Mice what steps it considers necessary wichin its own territory to secure the orderly conduct and the freedom of the elections. This is in accordance with Article 2(VII) of the Charter. I am therefore averse to the immediate notification of / the- 2 - of oho Security Council about matters of Persia's internal jurisdiction. 2. It is not cl.._.r to me in what exact terms the message given by the Soviet Ambassador was couched (Tehran telegram to Foreign Office No. 1934). If this message was merely an expression of Soviet views as to tho likely consequences of the Persian Government's decision, I do not consider that it is necessarily a formal notice of che Soviet Government's intention to intervene in Persian internal affairs. If the Soviet message was delivered as a note surely the first step is for the Persian Government to send a reply in accordance with normal diplomatic practice. The reply would presumably follow the lines of what the Persian Prime Minister has already said to the Soviet Ambassador (Tehran telegram No. 1929 paragraph 2). If the Soviet message was delivered orally and appeared to be a threat, th. Persian Government should ask for it in writing. I would then see no objection to its publication by the Persian Government together with the Persian Government's reply. The Persian Prime Minister should then await the Soviet reply or any fresh development in Azerbaijan before deciding on the HeXt Step. 3* You may if pressed speak to the Persian Prinw / MinisterMinister in tho foregoing s^ns^.

I saw the Prime Minister this evening and asked him for a fall account of the Soviet Ambassador's demarche on 28th November. The Prime Minister said that these representations were oral and were to the following effect. 2. It seemed clear from recent proclamation that the Persian Government intended to send armed forces into Azerbaijan and the Soviet Government had therefore instructed M. Sadjekov to say H in a friendly manner” that such action would precipitate disorders not only in Azerbaijan but also on Soviet frontier. They therefore suggested 'in a friendly manner' [grp. undec: ’frontier] Cypher/OTP CaBINMT DISTRIBUTION Moscow Angora Saving British Middle East Office 'o Saving .gdad Saving \ \ ddddddd woulcl/r~~ r. - 2 - O o 134 . would be in danger if t he ad were no.t sent. in.

Djavid had replied in the name of Provincial Council to the effect that despatch of aimed forces to Azerbaijan was unconstitutional and a breach of their agreement with Persian Government. The Government had today telegraphed rebutting these contentions and denying the right of Provincial Council to express an opinion in such a matter. They had warned them tiiat if despatch of these forces were resisted consequences would be very serious. I asked tne Prime Minister whether I had ♦ correctly reported him in paragraph 3 of my telegram No. 130 to you. He concurred in second sentence but demurred at the xirst and it was clear that he did not wish to commit himself to a definite interpretation of the ooviet Ambassador's remarks. I pointed out that in the absence of some such interpretation as I had attributed/- 3 - r / (£J r ' 3 *' 1 01 'Z A OS 0 i attributed to him it was difficult to undersrtand the / c 1 «. O a urgency of his enquiry of the Slfate Department about relerence to the Security Council. The Prime Minister said that he did not intend to make such a reference at this stage. Subject to Cabinet approval he proposed to reply orally to the Soviet Ambassador on lines indicated in my telegram No. 1929 paragraph 2, to send troops into Azerbaijan and to notify the Council if, and only if, subsequent developments made it clear that the Soviet Government was intervening against Persian forces. In that event it would not advance matters to invoke the Soviet Government's recent demarche and therefore he did not propose to ask the Soviet Ambassador to confirm his remarks in writing. 5* While I was v/ith him the Prime Minister received a telegram from Moscow which he read to me. It contained an account of parallel representations by Dekanosov to Firouz which were distinctly stern and stated that disorder in Azerbaijan or on the Soviet frontier would be a matter which the Soviet Government could not disregard. 6. It will, I think, be fairly clear from the above that the Prime Minister has shifted his ground since he spoke to the American ambassador two days ago but that he still contemplates despatch of forces to Azerbaijan as soon as necessary dispositions are complete. 7. In reply to my enquiry the Prime Minister informed/informed me that operations in AzeiJ^ijan would not ^ ^ ^ i j (repeat not) entail a postponement of elections elsewhere.

The Prime Minister returned to Tehran last night and received me this morning. He was very optimistic about the election prospects and expressed the view that Tudeh were unlikely to secure any seats in Gilan, Mazanderan or Kharassan. 2. With regard to Azerbaijan he readily admitted the force of argument developed in paragraph 2 of your 757*7 telegram No. 1221 and explained that he was now con sidering an alternative to his plan of appointing in spectors. Even if the latter were joined by neutral observers it was, he thought, doubtful whether results would be conclusive and such observers could not be appointed without a renewed appeal to the United Nations. Such an appeal could hardly be effective if it were made before the issue had been further clari fied i.e. before some further step had been taken to reveal continuance of action taken by Soviet inter vention in Azerbaijan. With this end in view, he was /now« « « mm** . mm • wmmmmtm* EXT 7891 now seriously considering coition c^n the following lines. Within the next few cloys o proclcnation would be node to the effect that the Governnent proposes to send certain armed forces 'with all constituencies in order to ensure free and untrammelled polling throughout the country. There would be no reference to any particu lar province but it would be made abundantly clear that any attempt to obstruct activities of the forces . in question would invalidate election in areas where such obstruction occurred. 3. The Prime Minister thought Azerbaijans may either (a) deny the right of the Government to send in forces or (b) refuse to admit them or (c) admit them and then deny them all freedom of action. In any of these three events it would be clear they were ^nyj-n g authority of the Central Government and an appeal to the United Nations would [gp^wadec] if it could be shown that this defiance was due to Soviet pressure*. The Prime Minister said that he hadd not yet decided how this vital point could best be brought out. If the course indicated at the end of the preceding paragraph were adopted it would, he explained, be necessary to cover the rear of the supervisory force for Azerbaijan with a much larger force which could be used if required to occupy the territory where the Government's authority had been defied. In other v/ords it might eventually become necessary to launch a full dress campaign in order to demons'crate Soviet stiffening of Azerbaijan military potentialities. The Prime Minister was clearly reluctant to commit himself to such a plan but I suggested the following alternative.

This event brings no real change to the position of the political parties in the country. The Azerbaijan Democrats and the Tudeh have always worked in the closest harmony, the Democrats of Kurdistan have never been anything more than a shadowy reflection of the Azerbaijan separatists and the two other parties are so obscure and unimportant that little or nothing is known of tnem. 3. The flourish of trumpets with A'hich the Tudeh Party have announced tne adhesion of these parties to the 'freedom front' is, I suspect, a device to divert attention from their failure to force the Democrat Party of Iran (the Prime Minister’s Party) to join this 'front' on terms which would have subordinated it to the will of tne Tudeh.

I am afraid that summary of Prime Minister's broad- ^ cast contained in my telegram No. 1754 did not bring out the fact that he referred specifically and at some length to Soviet interference and only asked us to take note of the fact that it is in the interests of good relations that 'the authorities of His Majesty's Government' should refrain from interference. As will be seen from tie full translation in my despatch No. 452, emphasis was in fact on Soviet interference and reference to His Majesty's Government a characteristic example of Qavam's 'policy of balance'. 2. Although the impression is certainly conveyed that His Majesty's Government might conceivably interfere it would, I consider, be unwise for us to construe it as an£V r insinuation that intervention has ^tn »11 i: m'j 2 - i.e. as giving the lie to your recent statement in the House of Commons. It would, I suggest, be more effec tive to point out that this warning to His majesty's Government is quite redundant and an invitation to our critics to resume agitation against us which has now begun to subside. 5. If you agree this approach to the Prime Minister I could then go on to develop the points made in your tele gram No, 1221, bearing in mind that the Prime Minister is now well aware of Russian intentions but still disposed to over-rate his own powers of resistance and to give way as soon as pressure is applied. It would, I am sure, be helpful if I were to seek an opportunity of speaking to the Shah on similar lines. 4.

This passage suggests that British officials have been and are interfering and, what is more, since there is no mention of Soviet interference, suggests that the British alone interfere in Persia's internal affairs. This' passage^seems to me most offensive. We carefully investigated the allegations against Mr, Tro'tt and found that they were baseless. The Persian Government ' ' s' s- accepted our assurances on this point and dropped their request for Mr. Trott s recall. The statement which the Secretary of State made on this subject was agreed in advance ^ with the Persian Government and contained a categorical ^ ^ ^ statement about the instructions given to British officials not to interfere in Persia’s internal affairs. It is therefore highly unsatisfactory that the Prime Minister should insinuate, as he has, that intervention has ^ S' ■ ' &lt;- recently been going on and ought to be stopped. You should say that we particularly resent being singled out for S S' mention when everyone, including the Prime Minister, is s ^ s ' , aware that the real threat to Persian territorial integrity ^ r y s- is not to be found in South* Persia at all, but in Azerbaijan, ^ ^ ^ and that Persia's principal problem has for some time been and still is, how to protect herself against falling s' y~ y partially or completely under Soviet domination.

In SHORT NOTICE QUESTION AND ANSWER Mr. M. R. Masani: Sir, I would like to state that this question was put last Friday: otherwise it would appear partly pointless. Mr. M. R.

Mr. H. Weightman: (a) Government are aware of the existence of the strong feelings of sympathy and indignation to which the Honourable Member refers. (b) Government understand that an appeal has been made to the Security Council of the United Nations Organization by the Persian Goverr^ent themselves. Mr. M. R. Masani: Since India is unfortunately not represented in the Security Council, will the Government of India convey to the British Govern-, ment the public opinion in this country that if small defenceless nations like Iran are to be left helpless against their powerful imperialist neighbours, the continued existence of the United Nations Organisation will become meaning less? Mr. H. Weightman: Sir, Government have sensed feelings of urgency, alarm and indignation in all parts of this House and in the country generally and they have represented these feelings to the Government in the United Kingdom as a member of the Security Council. Prof. N. G. Ranga: Has the attention of the Government been drawn to an article of the Purposes and Principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which states that all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or the use of force against the territorial integrity or political inde pendence of any State and, if so, will Government take the earliest possible steps before the Security Council actually meets to make all the members of the Security Council aware of the great anxiety felt by India about what is happening in Persia in her relation with Soviet Russia and of the threat involv ed in the same to India’s own territorial integrity on account of the inter national rivalries that are being carried on in Persia? Mr , H. Weightman: Sir, I think the answer to that question is really implicit in what I have just said. India is not a member of the Security Council and is therefore not seized of this matter, unless of course the question comes before the General Assembly of which she is a member. Consequently, since the Government in the United Kingdom is a member of the Security Coun cil. the Government of India have taken care to .draw the attention of the Government in the United Kingdom to the feelings which I have mentioned in my reply to the last supplementary question. Mr. Abdur Rahman Siddiqi: Will the-Honourable Member kindly inform the House whether the presence of Russian troops in North Persia was arranged at the Yalta Conference? Mr. H. Weightman: I am not quite sure what the Honourable Member means. Is he inquiring whether an arrangement was made at Yalta that Russian troops should be brought into Persia? If so, the answer is ‘No’. Mr. Abdur Rahman Siddiqi: I am suggesting that Russian troops are in Persia because the two other members of the Big Three had agreed to it. Is there any truth in this suspicion? Mr. H. Weightman: None whatsoever. Mr. Ahmed E. H. Jaffer: Is the Government of India so helpless in the matter? Cannot something substantial be done instead of merely represent ing Indian feelings to His Majesty’s Government?

If the inspectors report unfavourably, showing that electoral abuses have been prevalent, the Persian Government, if they attempt to disqualify the returned candidates as suggested by Quavam, will almost certainly be faced with strong Russian pressure for the admission to the ivlajlis of an Azerbaijan bloc of deputies, who would represent nothing but the success of Soviet interference and,, allying themselves with the Tudeh, would virtually control the new kajlis. In order to protect Persian unity and independence it will be the duty of the Persian Government to resist such Russian pressure and, if it is maintained, Persia may have to consider a fresh appeal tp the United Nations to protect herself from Russian interference in her internal affairs.FROM TEHRAN TO FOREIGN OFFICE .

Chief points were, elections must be held and intrigues to stop them defeated. Oood relations with Russia must be strengthened but it was to be ftoped that the Soviet Government v/ould put a stop to unfriendly broad casts from Moscow. Mutual goodwill and friendship inspired Anglo-Persian relations and it was important that all necessary steps should be taken to maintain law and order in the area of the A.I.O.C.'s operations. ut the same time it was to be hoped that in the interests of strengthening good relations between the two countries, all British officials in Persia v/ould carefully abstain from any interference in Persia's internal affairs. With the U.3.^. the happiest relations had been established and America's economic help was hoped for. All countries should understand however that the basis of good relations with Persia was scrupulous abstention from interference in Persia's internal affairs. Let no one try to bully pers ia. 2. Extensive internal reforms were intended includingthe elimination of political teaching from the schools and the expansion of educational facilities throughout the country, the continued application of a programme for the distribution of state lands to the peasantry while preserving the proper rights of private property together with energetic measures to improve the standard of living of the agricultural population and the proper regulation of relations between workmen;, and employers, 3. The i rime Minister concluded with a repudiation of the Tudeh Party's claim to be the only freedom loving party in the country.Y 4R | [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on. ] Cypher/OTP C ABK ST DISTRIBUTI ON, FROM TmUti TO FOREIGN OFFI CE, i/Ir.

Repeated to: Moscow, Washington and copies[sic] to: Middle East Office, Bagdad and Government of India. W:W:W:¥:W IMPORTANT . LIGHT. 7*73 My telegram No. 1747. The Prime Minister's plan for controlling legality of elections by means of inspections will clearly give him complete discretion to recognise candidates or not. He may have convinced himself that he will use this pov/er of veto to prevent imposition on new Majlis of a Communist phalanx from Azerbaijan but many of his countrymen do not feel equally confident that he will do so. I share their qualms and I fear that if under present conditions elections are held in Azerbaijan the Prime Minister will e unable to resist renewed Soviet pressure to which he ill then be exposed and vail end by allowing 21 Azerbaijani democrats to sit in the new Majlis which will be dominated by them and Tudeh. He will thus be Jrepeating on a much larger scale the mistake which he i now admits that he made in bringing Tudeh Ministers to l his last Cabinet. 2. The consequences of such a step may well be irreparable and it is therefore not surprising that many of those who are opposed to indefinite postponement feel very strongly that there should be some clear guarantee thatthat polling in Azerbaijan will n ot be ra$ fignisecl as legal until the authority of the Central Government has been reasserted there e.g. by despatch of crack garrisons to key points in the province. Religious leaders have now issued manifesto embodied in my immediately following telegram and I understand they did so as a result of Prime Minister's refusal to consider their request for postponement of polling in Azerbaijan subject to some such guarantee as above. If this is really their attitude I find it quite justifiable although of course insistence on guarantee of this kind may well precipitate open secession of Azerbaijan, In my opinion however the Iranian Government may be wise to eradicate the risk of losing this rich province rather than to allow Azerbaijani Communists to enter the new Majlis and by so doing to jeopardise their national independence. 3. My'present inclination is therefore to seek an audience of the Shah and to tell him that while elections should be held as soon as possible in other provinces they should not be held in Azerbaijan until the real effects of guarantees have been obtained that they will reflect the true wishes of the population. Do you authorise me to speak in this sense when acting on instruction in your telegram No,1172? 4.

Although disapproving since it indicates that Qavam will probably have to abandon his progressive internal policy, it is not violent. Importance of the article lies in the emphasis which it places on British activities. Its tone is best judged by the fact that it repeats previous stories about the role of Trott and Gault in the Kashgai revolt without even referring to the various official denials which have been made. While there is no mention of the American attitude, the article makes out that the change of Government is the result of British pressure.

It criticises the committee recently appointed to supervise elections on the ground that it is composed exclusively of members of the Prime Minister's own party. 3.

Governor General informs me that Mamassani, leader of Hussein Quli Rustam, with 700 tribesmen has come to help his nephew Malik Mansur Bashti and is now at Du Gunbadan. Together they are defying warnings of divisional commands. The latter has given them an ultimatum expiring October 16th morning, to the effect that if Malik Mansur does not submit and hand back the rifles he has taken from the gendarmerie, bombs will be dropped on his fort at Basht. 2. Governor General is most anxious to avoid future hostilities. He suggests that the arrival of Mamassani at Du Gunbadan which is part of Gach Saran area and is in fact adjacent to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's landing- ground, is a direct threat to the oil area and therefore would justify a last minute attempt by Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to persuade Malik Mansur either to submit and hand over the rifles or at any rate to retire with Mamassani to Basht. He requests that Anglo-Iranian Oil Company be asked to send Jeacock or Fowler both of whom know the parties concerned personally to deliver such a message at once*r EXT 7102 4R j - 2 - 3* It is true that Malik Mansur is in many ways dependent on Anglo Iranian Oil Company and v/ould probably pay more attention to what they say than to Persian Government's messages.

I felt bound to express appreciation of these assurances but I asked the Prime minister if he were really convinced that the Tudeh party (even if in a minority) once they were returned at the polls would carry out their undertaking to respect his authority. From his reply it was clear that the Prime Minister is not convinced on this point* He asked whether I had any suggestion to make c I warned him that the Coalition to which he had agreed bore a sinister resemblance to other Coalitions with which I am familiar. It seemed to me that he had a choice between two evils- On the one hand there might be a recrudescence of disorder and on the otter an order rooted m disorder v/hich would be repel'enl to the vast majority of his countrymen. There could be no doubt which would produce more unpleasant consequences. 1 made no positive suggestion but if you consider any can usefully be made it is now open to me to do so. I have no doubt that by concluding this electoral pact the Prime Minister/,.,(J5o) - 3 - Linister believes he will obtain a majority for his own party which he could not hope for otherwise* He may well be right but I veiy much doubt whether any majority he may secure will prevent Tudeh from dominating the next Majlis.

It was recognised that any statement issued should make it clear beyond any ‘question of doubt that from now the public recognised that all allegations and insinuations which have been made about Trott and other British officials were entirely without foundation. 2 . I said, however, that I was quite prepared to explore possibility of finding some alternative fonn of words for sentence at (a) and eventually agreed to suggest to you substitution of following 'the Persian Government have accepted His Majesty’s Government's assurances and regard matters as closed. H 3. Early this morning M. Nikpay telephoned to say that Prime Minister would agree to this formula if following words were inserted M and should no firmer indications be revealed regard matter as closed.' Addition of this reservation completely changes the sense of the whole statement. It implies that there was substance in the charges brought but that for the time being Persian Government are prepared to overlook this. I therefore refused to consider it. 4. Later on I spent an hour with the Prime Minister and used every argument to persuade him to drop his reservation. He admitted force of my remarks but was unable to agree. Discussion was resumed this afternoon between 0. G. and M. Nikpay with Cabinet in session in an 0 adjoining room and in the end Prime Minister suggested /thethe following formula: ’’The Persian Government have accepted His Majesty's Government’s assurances v/ith goodwill and case may therefore be regarded as closed.” 5. Unsatisfactory as it is I fear we cannot hope to extract a better agreed solution from the present Persian Government. The only alternative would presumably be a unilateral statement by His Majesty’s Government on entirely different lines which would in no way commit the Persian Government and therefore would not carry the same weight with world opinion.r~~ IND EXfcO EXT 7099 W( [This tclcgrcu.L is of! part icsecrecy and should be retained by the a at ligrtT^d recipient and not passed on] Cypher/OTP Mr.Le Rougetel K o, 1656 • o;jh-^ DISTRIBUTION XRCM TO gORUKa OIVIGS,.

This demand was definitely rejected at a Cabinet meeting on October 2nd, the chief opponent being Minister of Finance, Hajir, supported by Minister of Commerce. Eskandari, who is a member of Tudeh party. 2. Two days after this decision, the Soviet Ambassador saw Eskandari and protested strongly against his attitude. There is little doubt that Soviet Ambassador had been informed by Muzaffar Firuz. The American Ambassador who claims to have proof of this tells me he intends to take the Prime Minister very seriously to task on grounds that, in the circumstances described his retention in office of Firuz is tantamount to a surrender of sovereignty. 3, Allen feels particularly strongly about this question and this is hardly surprising for, according to my information, Pan-American Airways are now .Tanning to initiate a service to India via Angora Tabriz and Tehran.

You should remind him of the assurances which Kis majesty's b-overnuent have given of their desire to see a strong, united and independent Persia, and you should impress upon him that it is surely contrary to Persia's interests that, at a time when the soviet Government are showing signs of impatience, the rersian Government should alienate the sympathies of Kis majesty's Government by maintaining quite fantastic charges (apparently based on the lying statements of an arrested plotter) against one of the most experienced and reliable British representatives in the country. You should go on to say that Kis majesty's Government can no longer postpone making some public statement which will make their position in Persia clear, but that if the rersian Government are not prepared to drop their request for hr. Trott's recall, and tne matter must therefore continue to be a subject of negotiation between the two Governments, then the statement will of course have to take a very different form. 3.

I think that reply to Minister of War, if indeed any reply is necessary, should be non-committal, even at the risk of discouraging a potential organiser of resistance to Russian pressure. It is not for us to advise him on Persian internal affairs, or to provide him with a plan on which to base his military operations in Pars. Nor can we hold out much hope of 'British support' for him whatever this may imply if he attempts to force his Prime Minister to adopt a policy displeasing to the Russians, for we should presumably find it more than difficult to implement such promises. 2. Moreover, we do not think that the time has yet come when Qawam must be replaced. He seems up to the present to have been standing up to the Russians fairly well, and the fact that he has now been forced to agree to the holding of elections does not necessarily mean that he will in future be completely under Russian control. In any case is there any successor who would do better? 5. In these circumstances it is felt that no reply need be sent to the Minister of War for the present, and that the matter can be reconsidered after publication of the statement proposed in my telegram No. 1137 [ of October loth ].T 75 ' I O i [This tclGgraa is o^ 1 partic^^r secrecy and should be retained by the authgri-&amp;e4-roGip-ient and not Cypher/OTP Mi*.

The Shah spoke again to the .Vnerican ambassador at a reception on October 8th on the sane lines. He also said that he strongly suspected that Britain and Russia, no natter what night be said to the contrary had agreed upon the creation of spheres of influence in Persia, that this decision dated from the Moscow Conference- of last December and that Dr.Millspaugh had been instrumental in bringing it about. IJlen derived the impression that the Shah is casting about for some pretext to shift the responsibility, which must be his, deciding whether or not to replace Qawam and appoint a caretaker Government to hold elections. ..lien spoke to the Shah on lines I had suggested but ma.de it clear teat he was speaking for himself and not for me. 2. -The Shah told the Military Mttachd on October 7th that under present conditions it v/ould, in iact, be impossible to hold the elections, and I have no doubt that he is thereby seeking to console himself for having signed| To, 0 1 - 2 - signed the electoral decree. There is, of course, no substance in this thesis as a quorum of the new Majlis can be elected in constituencies at present under effective government control.

There is little doubt that Prime Minister is under increasing pressure to agree to formation of a ‘‘common front agamic reaction‘‘ i*e e to an electoral Cartel with Tudeh parry for the purpose of contesting elections. 2r. Muzaffar Firuz told me last night that the Government would be satisfied with 60 per cent of the ; seats in new Majlis. vi/hile he was careful to avoid saying so, it was plain from context that he must be discussing with other parties represented in the Govern ment a percentage formula for nomination of candidates in new Majlis. He refused to be drawn about dates but said elections would not be postponed merely in order to facilitate xeturn of candidates from areas v/hich are not in communication with the capital. 3. It-»2~* 3. It seems clear from the above that Prime Minister will agree to return of a Majlis under effective Communist control. In so far as elections are not held (or recognised) in remoter constituencies, but are so held and recognised in Azerbaijan, the forces of extreme Left may be even stronger. In any case there can be little doubt that whether Qawam remains in office or not he is about to surrender any real power he may nave had and wittingly or unwittingly to set the seal upon establishment of a puppet Government in this country.

L The Shah saw American Ambassador on October 5th and gave him a similar account of Q.‘s attitude.

Is he simply fishing for United States financial and economic assistance, or do you think that‘he really wants to modify his policy and take a tougher line with the Azerbaijan local government and extreme left wing elements? The pursuit of such a course would of course be likely to incur the displeasure of the Soviet Government and it would be of some interest to know v/hether Qawam is in fact prepared to face this prospect. 2 . I should also welcome your observations on the motives behind Qawam‘s decision to attend the United Nations assembly. Does he consider that, in spite of the tribal rising in the south the situation in Persia is now sufficiently stable to peimit of his absence for a certain period, or is it possible that, on the contrary, Qawam foresees increasing difficulties for himself so long as he remains in office and is therefore preparing to with draw gracefully and hand over to somebody else?% [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed onj Cypher/OTP G^BIN^T DISTRIBUTION FROM t ehr:,r to foreign office Mr, Le Rougatei.

An important three column article by the well-known Middle East commentator Lutski on the continued presence of British troops in countries of the Middle East appears in official Izvestiya of September 12th. 2. Lutski declares that the exact number of British troops in this theatre is unknown, as the British (jovernment and press prefer to keep it secret but that they may be estimated at 200,000 men in Egypt, more than 1,000,000 in the Sudan, Ethiopia and Libya, 60,000 in Palestine, 150,000 men in Transjordan and not less than 100,000 in Iraq plus the new reinforcements. 5. Lutski then makes the usual charges that the British are maintaining their military installations in Persia, Syria and the Lebanon, that they occupy Bushire, Bahrein, Persian Baluchistan and Khuzistan, that British1 6328 naval bases control the Eastern Mediterranean, the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, that the whole Arab East is covered with a thick network of air bases and that the Arab armies are essentially off shoots of the British army. 4. Lutski states that the peoples of the entire area are unanimous in demanding the evacuation of British troops. In order to prove that this continued British occupation is a violation of the Arabs wishes, he summarised the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations on familiar lines and points to the popular demands in all the Arab countries for the withdrawal of the British. 5. He then asks when [sic: ?what is] the purpose behind retention of British troops in the Middle East? Clearly the occupation of these countries 300 kms. from Britain cannot be of vital importance for the defence of Britain's frontiers. Nor can it be to maintain her colonial empire since the enslavement of one country does not justify the occupation of states that lie on her path and if British colonial mastery over India is impossible without occupation of the Arab East, then it follows that Britain should liberate India. In fact, as British statesmen claim that India is now independent, they have no argument to justify their actions in the Middle East. 6. Attacking the argument that the British are occupying the Middle East in order to protect the Arabs, Lutski declares that there is no one to defend them against [?gp, omitted] except Britain herself, stories about/about the threat of Soviet expansion in the Arab Sast are ludicrous and fabricated by British reactionary circles in order to conceal the real expansion of British imperialism. 7. Lutski discovers the real purpose of British occupation in a statement by Drew Pearson that the iliddle East is one of the most important places d* armes of the ’•third world war”, where according to New Statesma_n , Britain aims at creating with the help of the United States of America an anti-Russian bloc. 8. This policy is attributed to you by further quoting from New Statesman to the effect that a year after your coming to power, the conclusion must be drawn that you are continuing the imperialist struggle against Russia and maintaining the Gurzon and Churchill traditions in this respect. 9. New Statesman , is then quoted as condemning the disastrous consequences of this policy and as arguing that it is still possible to achieve the mutual under standing of the Big Three, on the basis of which the Kiddle East may be developed to the advantage both of the Arabs and the Great Powers. 10. Lutski’s article concluded that United Nations Organisation is called upon to organise lasting peace, and that the Middle East peoples and the whole world expect from United Nations Organisation that it will seriously study the problems of the Arab countries and insist on their independence and the withdrawal of foreign troops, and thus ’’liquidate the threat to general/f EXT I 6328 ! * l • 4 - general security which the militarist policy of Britain has created In this part of the world”, 11, Text of Lutski's article follows by bag..

This article sums up the increasingly violent campaign against us in Middle East, following those on continued presence of British troops in Egypt (my ^ telegram No. 29 22), Palestine and Transjordan (my telegram * No. 2956)^ and Iraq (my telegram No, 5001). 2. These articles seem in the first place intended to prepare the ground for discussion by Security Council of Gromyko's demand for evacuation of troops from non enemy territories. They form part of the general campaign on the same lines, which also covers British and American land, air and sea power in Greece, Turkey and the Aegean, American troops in China (itself the subject of a major campaign lasting several weeksEXT ' 6326 see Far East weekly summaries), American naval 'expansion 1 ' in Pacific, Atlantic and even Mediterranean, American 'hemisphere defence' plans in Latin America (see Chancery letter of 11th September to South American Department), and American concern with the Arctic. Basic themes common to all are (A) insistent demand of the local population and of progressive forces in Britain and America for the evacuation of troops, (B) threat to peace and security created by their continued stay, and (C) need for U.N.O. to intervene in order to protect democracy and sovereignty of countries concerned. 3. Throughout these articles, Soviet Union poses as champion of sovereign independence of small nations against British and American imperialism, encourages them to bring their demands for withdrawal of British and American troops before U.N.O. 4. For purposes of internal propaganda Soviet Union is made to appear as encircled on every side by vast war preparations of imperialist Anglo-Saxon powers. Latest series of articles about Arab world goes further than any other post-war Soviet propaganda in openly alleging British military preparations for a campaign against Soviet Union and her satellites from Middle East theatre. Lutski’s article indeed suggests thatr EXT 6326 ; , ~ | - 5 that no other explanation could account for the mintenace of over 600,040 [sic] men in Middle East, and that British and American press admits as much, 5, d subsidiary object may be to provoke us into correcting exaggerated Soviet figures for British troops in Middle East, although I can hardly believe that the Soviet Government are so ill-informed on this point as their propaganda suggests, 6, This propaganda campaign against British and American militarism which is shown as directed against the Soviet Union is the most bitter and consistent which I can recall in the eighteen months I have been here. It would indeed be disturbing had we not been progressively conditioned over the past six months, in interesting feature is that there is no longer any attempt to play us off against the Americans or vice-versa, as in the past, We are both attacked with equal ferocity for the same reasons and represented as part of a joint inglo-Saxon bloc to a greater extent than ever before, 7, Assuming, as I think we in Moscow must on the evidence available to us, that this propaganda is not designed to prepare the way for [grp. undec.] Soviet act of aggression, its object seems to be twofold. On the one hand it fits, with the current local alarmist military rumour on which I have reported separately, into the internal campaign of disciplinary re- ihdoctrination.r EXT 6326 indoctrination, of hostility to the outside uorld and of increased efforts for that successful accomplishment of the five year plan. On the other it may frighten those with weaker nerves in Britain and America into advocating renewed appeasement of the Soviet Union in Paris and elsewhere. Relative silence over Turkey compared with explosive comment on Rrab world may be ominous in this [grp. undec.]. To judge by wireless reports of Hr. Henry Wallace's speech yesterday and by some recent British press reactions e.g. New Statesman proposal for a new deal over the Dardanelles and the Middle East generally, the Russians may be achieving some success in their second as well as in their first objective. They will I fear be much encouraged by President Truman 1 s endorsement of Henry Wallace's ill-considered and badly-timed remarks.

The last tune His Majesty received me was on the l 6 th May. an * audience which I reported in my telegram No .680 of that date. good ^ deal has happened. He lax ions between the Shah ondthe Prime Minister have been strained and Princess Ashraf’s visit to Moscow gave rise to rumours that the Soviet Government + off a g ainst - each other. I have little doubt that the Shah was piqued by our new and obvious reluctance to intervene in Persian internal affairs and that in consequence he was ready to lend an ear to stories which were current and no doubt were planted on him, about a deal between ourselves and the Soviet Union, by which we had surrendered our interests in Persia in return for ’'compensation * 1 elsewhere. If I am right in this/' the despatch of British-Indian troops to Basra must have compelled the Shah and many of his subjects to revise their views. ■i* However this may be, a few days ago I received an invitation to dine with the Shah informally at his Summer Palace last night. Dinner was preceded by an audience at which the political situation was discussed but there were no leadinp 1 questions such as His Majesty has put to me on previous occasions, uring the rest of the evening the conversation was of a general nature and very friendly. Altogether His Majesty kept me for hours and no one else was present. He opened the audience by ? ha h ? d n( ? t seen me f or a long time.

I said that I was sure His Majesty need have no qualms on this score. The inoependence of this and all other sovereign states was one of the most important aspects of the maintenance of law and order in ^ rl(i which had always been and I was sure would continue to be, the overricing concern of His Majesty^s Government.

As hov/ever the Persian Governoient are aware, His Majesty's Government have recently been seriously concerned at the increasing activities of the extremist elements in the Tudeh party, which were behind the recent disturbances and strikes in the oilfields and also the anti-British demonstrations at Meshed and elsewhere. His Majesty's Government have noted however that the Persian Government have not so far shown s r 1 themselves ready to take effective action to curb these extremists activities. For example, the perpetrators of the outrages ol the 14th July, during which a number • ✓ s' of Persian subjects were murdered, still go unpunished, while nothing effective has Deer done to curb the violent attacks in the Persian press on His Majesty's Government and on the Anglo-Iranian Oil Companyc It is the hope of His Majesty’s Government that they will see the Persian Govern- S' S' S’ ment taking increasingly effective measures to remedy the / S s situation. Such a course would have the full approval of His Majesty's Government, who for their part are doing *S s' v everything possible, in the oilfields area, to remedy such grievances as the workers may have and to facilitate the task of the Persian authorities in restoring and maintaining order. A satisfactory response from the Persian Government should prepare the way for a steady improvement and strengthening of Anglo-Persian relations.

Repeated to : Jerusalem Red Star of September 8th publishes a 2-column article by Colonel Tolchenov entitled 'Transjordan and Palestine as a British military training ground in the Near East' in which the writer maintains that British rule in Iraq, Palestine and Transjordan is not explained so much by their economic importance (despite Iraqi oil) as by their strategic importance at the junction of 3 continents. 2. Tolchenov claims that both before and during the war Britain converted Palestine and Transjordan into gigantic strategic bases, and by constructing barracks, roads, railways, airfields and ports indicated that she was preparing a base in the Middle East 'suitable for action in any direction'. 3o The inaction of 2 British armies and the Polish army of General Anders at a critical stage of the war against Germany, continued military preparations in Transjordan, the presence of a garrison exceeding 60,000 troops in Palestine, the recent arrival of British and Indian troops in Basra, and the suppression of any move ment towards independence, are all then quoted by Tolchenov to show that Britain is trying to realise wider aims than the maintenance of her economic and political positions in the Middle East countries. 4. Tolchenov declares that this expansionist policy is creating a centre of unrest in the Middle East and is far from being dictated by a desire for peace in this area, he concludes that any aggressive act attracts the attention not only of the countries against which it is directed, but of all other States vitally interested in universal peacce IMPORTANT Cairo Bagd ad New York (for Sir A.

It was quite clear from what he said that no appreciable progress has been made in negotiations with the delegation from Tabriz. The Prime Minister said that both Dr, Javid and Mr. ohabastari were disposed to be co operative but were prevented from making any concessions by Pishavari. Main points of difference at present were refusal of Azerbaijanis to permit re-occupation of Zinjan and district which had been agreed with them in June, and re—organisation of military command. The Prime Minister is determined that not only Commander-in-Chief but also Brigade Commanders shall be selected from officers of the regular army. So far Azerbaijani delegation has refused to budge on either point. 3.

Rahbar and Irane Ma are quoted for the allegations that he left Persia without a passport or permission of the Persian Government, that 'every one knows' who arranges these iourneys which are used against the Govern ment. and that the British Ambassador’s statement making maintenance of order in Khuzistan a Persian Government responsibility is hypocritical and at variance with the facts, 3. Report continues with the charge that the Persian Government, far from combatting the interference of imperialist elements, is actually leaving Mesbah Fateni free to suppress the Trade Unions and their leaders. Protests by Rahbar against this policy are then given, and report concludes with the hope expressed in Keihan that the Prime Minister will apply his declaration for bidding association with foreigners to Sheikh Abdullah, whose journey points to the existence of a 'comprehensive plan regarding Southern Persia'. 4. Press of 23rd also prints short Beirut Tass message quoting A1 Rayadli to effect that fresh British and Indian troops are due to arrive in Basra, and will be sent to the Turco-Iraqi frontier. 5. The situation in Khuzistan also figures in Izvestiya International Review of 23rd, where it is claimed that events in Southern Persia ar^ an internal affair of Persia 'If one disregards the artificial attempts to give them a foreign policy complexion', 6. Familiar charges against the xinglo-Persian Oil Com pany follow, leading to .the accusation that the British Government used events in Khuzistan to interfere in Persia’s internal policy. Despatch of troops to Iraq is described as a flagrant breach of the Anglo-Iraqi treaty of 1930, while once again the 'Pro-British Istanqlal Party' is accused of initiating a provocative campaign for the Union of Khuzistan with Iraq. 7. Article then asks why Britain does not bring her /disputedispute v/ith Persic before the Security Council, especially since it v/cs the British who secured tne reten tion on the Council’s agenda of the Persian question when it concerned Soviet-Persion relations. The answer to this question is found in the alleged statenent of a Foreign Office Official that Britain would take unilateral action if her interests were threatened, and would not^ consider herself obliged to consult the Security Council owing to the tine factor. 8. Fron this ’’lordly and contenptuous attitude”, the conclusion is drav/n that British diplonacy respects the organs of international security only when she can use then as a weapon to inpose her will on other states.

The Prime Minister said that in any case he had not thought of staying away for long. 3. Ns regards future policy the Prime Minister said that he now intended to insist on a final settlement with Azerbaijan. Until this was achieved there could be no question of a general election. He felt he could now rely on the army and was prepared if necessary to use force.

He has informed the State Department of this reply and seemed to be impressed with the Prime Minister's determination to force a decision within the next week. 4. My own feeling is that the Prime Minister merely wishes to know where he stands with regard to U.M.O. now that he is re-opening discussions with Pishevari. He no doubt wishes to continue playing for time but must be under increasing pressure from the Russians to announce the general elections and as a prelude to take represen tatives of the Azerbaijani Democrats into the Central Government, is stated in my telegram Ho. 804 I believe this is the main issue outstanding between Tehran and Moscow and the Soviet Government may well be unwilling to accept the recent Cabinet reshuffle as a substitute for the real thing. The Prime Minister however may try to avail himself of the refusal of Pishevari to collaborate with him as nullifying his deal with the Soviet Government and therefore as a pretext for postponing the elections indefinitely. If, as now seems probable, he has to fight the elections on a joint platform with Tudeh, his reluctance would not be difficult to understand. iJLl my information is to the effect that he already regrets his decision to bring them into the Government.

The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company has now appointed a Public Relations Officer to conduct publicity towards both its own employees and the Persian public but since he is located in Abadan he will only be able to handle the first satisfactorily. 2. Apart from the necessity of publicity &amp;r the benefit of A.I.O.C. employees, I consider it most important that both firms should keep the public informed of the essential facts regarding their position and activities in Persia and also be able to provide factual contradiction of the constant mis statements made about them. 3 .

But formal reimposition of ban on contact with foreign Embassies which was enforced tacitly during the rdgime of Reza Shah is a gross breach of diplomatic usage.

In fact, however, its effect will be to hold the ring for the Communists and their various agencies who are plainly quite responsible to the Soviet Embassy. Communist organ :i Rahbar n publishes this morning/mi 'll.'jjjM tmm i 1 morning a statement by the Central Committee of Tudeh party to the effect that three Tudeh Ministers who have joined the new Government were nominated by them for that purpose. This seems to dispose of any suggestion that the Prime Minister has imposed his views upon Tudeh, rather than vice versa (see my telegram No. 1224). It therefore follows that there would have been no question of isolating foreign Embassies unless such a step were designed to facilitate Tudeh activities. 2. Pending your instructions I do not propose to contest the right of Persian Government to impose this ban, but I am considering very carefully what immediate Members of British'Council organisation - including British Institution and'its various^branches - who are ^ and should'receive identical treatment.' In order to decide to contest the order, 'we may find .ourselves / action should be taken. - / Unless His Majesty’s Government ' ' .

I have now had an opportunity of discussing this proclamation with my American colleague. He agrees with me that the issue of such an order without any official warning or intimation to the heads of missions here is extremely discourteous and he does not propose to take cognisance of it until he is directly informed. He also agrees that its effect will be to clear the way for Communist activities but he thinks that the Prime Minister himself may be chiefly concerned to forestall the charge that members of his Government are ‘‘taking their instructions from Soviet Ambassador’ 1 . 2. As regards relative merits of accepting or contesting the ban his natural instinct like my own would be to contest it. On the other hand the Soviet Ambassador will, no doubt, accept it with alacrity and will then be credited with an innocence which he certainly does not deserve as regards interference in Persian armistice affairs. Mr. Allen and I on the other hand will be decried as incurable meddlers. In other v/ords our true rdles will be reversed.- 2 - 5. American Ambassador had not made up his mind whether the ban should be accepted, contested or ignored, I agreed with him that we could and perhaps should ignore it so long as we did not receive any fom of official intimation but expressed a view that sooner or later we shall be obliged to adopt a definite line and to tell Prime Minister what it is. Balance of advantage seems to me to be in accepting the ban provided Persian Government do not apply it in a grossly partial or unreasonable manner e.g, that all genuine cultural bodies are exempted* Minister of Education Kishavarz has informed the American Cultural Attache that it is not intended to apply ban to cultural organisations. 4. The American Ambassador's general impression is that although the ban has been more publicised than it was under Reza Shah or other totalaterian regime, it is for that very reason to be taken less seriously, but on this point I prefer to reserve judgment.

Since I came into Office it has been my aim to bring about a spirit of unity and co-operation between all progressive element in the country. It is for this reason that I have reformed by Cabinet and have brougnt into it new elements representing progressive parties. The principal aims of the programme of reform on which Government will now embark are:- (1) A progressive national economy with encourage ment to Persian capital to undertake the development of Persian industry and agriculture. ' (2) The assignment of a more appropriate part of the national revenue to public education health industry and agriculture• (3) The revision of all legislation not in harmony with progressive principles of the Charter of the United Nations. (4) Execution of embezzlers of public funds and summary execution of armed bandits and disturbers of the pe ace. (5) The prosecution of traitors and by creation of special courts for the rapid execution of justice. (6) The regularisation of the relations between landlords and peasants by means of special legislation applicable to all parts of the country. (7) The acceleration of agricultural reform of the division of State lands among the peasants. (8) The radical reform of the financial position of the country. (9) The elimination of unemployment and the amelioration of the working conditions of factory workers by means of the strict application of the labour law. 3. My foreign policy is based on the strengthening of sincere and friendly relations with all foreign powers of particularly the U.S.S.R. Great Britain and United States on the basis of the Charter of the United /NationsNations and of mutual respect on the maintenance of world peace and on the protection of the vital interests sovereignty and^ integrity of Persia. I am determined to prevent all interference by foreign governments in ne internal affairs of Persia. In consequence the following points must be strictly observed. ( a /‘ ^or the future all contact with Embassies and Legations is prohibited to all Persians except state officials whose duties require them to enter into relations with foreign missions and vifoo have been authorised to do so by their official superiors. Those who contravene this injunction will be at once dismissed. (b) Persons not in Government service and who have no business to discharge with Embassies and Legations must in future abstain from all contact with foreicri missions. I I look to accredited foreign representatives to idie staffs of Embassies and Legations and to Consuls of friendly and Allied Governments to abstain from all relations with all unauthorised persons and to observe the spirit of 1he above injunction, so that the ties of xnendship may be strengthened and all misunderstanding avoided. It will be clear that my decisions have been taken solely in order to strengthen the national spirit and to prevent activities which unhappily, have become (iuring £ )as ' fc years. I am determined to uphold the above principles with all necessary severity.FILE COPY I* feVV 1 I* 1 lb [This telegram of part^ retained by the &gt;, v 13V i o [CITHER]. of pary-^ular) secrecy and should be jithor iseu r eciD ient and not passed on] CABINET DISTRIBUTION,, FROM KHOR RA^ISHAJ-IR TO TEHRAN .

These statements added that the members of the commission were Colonel Zarghami from the Ministry of War, Police Colonel Turuj Amin and two senior officials from the Ministry of Justice. 2. This commission is, in all^probability, the one which the Prime Minister told me on July l8th that he intended to send to Khuzistan.

On the evening of July 4th at Tudeh meeting speeches were delivered from balcony of shops opposite this Consulate General to crowd of about 1,000 persons. Speakers freely used abusive language against the British, accusing them of interfering in the affairs of the country and attempting to maintain strangle-hold on Persia by giving their support to reactionaries and traitors. Tudeh propaganda has recently been giving special mention to men like Kifai, Amir, Taimur Kalali and Qureishi of Meshed, Ardeshir of Bujnurd, and Marandi, Manager of Anglo-Iranian Oil Company all of whom are vilified as tools of the British. Anti-British slogans have appeared in posters pasted on the walls. British indifference to all this being interpreted as weakness. Mr. Le Rougetel 12th July 1946.2* Public opinion about Hizb-I-Democrat is that Qawam is aiming dictatorship with the hacking of Russians. Fact that man like Rahimidan has been entrusted with formation of this party in Khorassan has curbed zeal of those sections who intended to join under misapprehension that the new party was an attempt by the Prime Minister to throw off shackles of Russian influence in Persian politics, and form a party that would in the course of time over-whelm Tudeh. 3. Aga Marandi is shortly proceeding on leave, and his successor as manager of Anglo-Iranian Oil Company has arrived in Meshed.

Mr. Northcroft then urged Agha Mesbah Fatemi to return to Khuzistan as quickly as possible. Agha Mesbah Fatemi, who seemed to be well informed on present conditions in Khuzistan and the action being taken by the Iranian Authorities in Tehran, told Mr. Northcroft that it would not be advisable for him to return to Khuzistan until he had received a copy of the Decree of the Council of Ministers giving him authority to declare martial law anywhere in Khuzistan at his discretion. He stated that this Decree had been opposed by Aghai Mozzafar Firouz and the Minister of Commerce and Industry. It had, however, been issued by the Council of Ministers (the only minister who refused to sign being the Minister of Commerce and Industry) and communicated to the O.C. Troops Ahwaz. Aghai Mesbah Fatemi expected to obtain a copy of this Decree on July 6 th, in which event he would fly to Abadan by Iranian Airways on July 7^. The Governor General also informed Mr. Northcroft that he had obtained the Prime Minister’s agreement to the Chief Justice and two Interrogators at Ahwaz being changed. The necessary instructions in regard to this matter had been sent by the Prime Minister* s Office to the Ministry of justice and Aghai Mesbah Fatemi is engaged in following this matter up. 2. The Governor General infonned Mr. Northcroft that both he and Aghai Aramesh (Under-Secretary to the Minister of Commerce and Industry) had given the Prime Minister a full account of the serious state of affairs in Khuzistan and had informed the Prime Minister that the reasons for this state of affairs were entirely political. As a result, the Prime Minister had instructed Aghai Mesbah Fatemi to take strong measures at his discretion to prevent disturbances. The Prime Minister also told the Governor General that the following action should be taken (a) the agitators, Ali Gmid (Ahwaz) and Najafi (Abadan) must be expelled from Khuzistan: (b) a Governor should be appointed to Agha Jari: (c) the Gendarmerie forces at Agha Jari should be increased: (d) a Police force should be put into Agha Jari. 3 , Aghai Mesbah Fatemi stated that he was very glad to have had the opportunity of visiting Tehran since, in the course of his talks with the Prime Minister, he fully realised that the Government*s policy was not (as circumstances had led Government officials in Khuzistan to believe) one of propitiating the Tudeh Party at any cost. A. The4. The Governor General stated that on returning to Khuzistan he expected to bring the situation there under control. He proposed to do this mainly by taking a strong line with agitators and arresting anyone who makes or threatens ~Nto make trouble. 5. Aghai Mesbah Fatemi infomed Mr. horthcroft that Colonel Mohtashami (Police) had excused himself from being transferred from Burujird to Abadan for family reasons. The Governor General, however, expected to be able to replace Lt. Colonel La^li by Colonel Mohtashami in the autumn. 6 . Mr. Northcroft asked the Governor General if he considered that the Government forces in Khuzistan were adequate to deal with any eventualities. Aghai Mesbah Fatemi said he thought they were quite sufficient; he explained any lack of action in the past by the fact that the Government officials were uncertain about the policy of the Central Government and were anxious to avoid getting themselves into trouble. 7 . Mr. Northcroft told the Governor General that the General Management in Abadan is anxious to give him as full information as possible with regard to their difficulties and to co-operate closely with him so that he can be in a position to afford the necessary protection to the Company^ employees and property. Aghai Mesbah Fatemi said he was sure that the General Management would continue to co-operate closely with him in the future as they had done in the past and he on his part would do everything possible to prevent breaches of the peace. 8 . The Governor General said he would try to pay a courtesy call on H.E. the British Ambassador and Colonel Pybus. If, however, he should be unable to do so, he would be glad if Mr. Northcroft would explain to them that this was due to lack of time. Mr. Northcroft said he would pass this message on to H.E. the British Ambassador and Colonel Pybus.

I have just learnt that Russian Consul visited the Governor of Abadan yesterday and stayed with him three or four hours. It is said that he told the Governor that he had information that a number of British officers had been left behind in Abadan after the evacuation of British troops and were no*// employed in A. I.O.C.. He wanted to know their names and details about them. The Governor replied that he had only recently arrived and had no information about them. The Consul then made enquiries about Arabs in this area and what connexion they had with Iraqi Arabs. He said that Chief of Court was not satisfactory and that he was to be recalled to Tehran. The Governor replied he had just received orders from Tehran to the effect that the Chief of Court should proceed to Tehran forthwith. The Consul then asked if the Governor had received any instructions from Tehran about Armenians wishing to change their nationality. The Governor replied he had not although in fact he had received secret instructions from Tehran to the effect that every facility was to be extended to the Armenians in the event of their wishing to change their nationality. 2. I understand that the Russian Consul also called on certain A,I,0.C. officials but I will check up on this and report further. [Note by Comms.

IN Persia the Tudeh (“ Mass ”) Party has emerged as the best organised and most vocal political party. My colleagues may be interested, therefore, to see the last published programme of the party. The programme is dated 1944 and no detailed programme has been published since, but it may be expected that a new programme will be published before the forthcoming parliamentary elections. The text of the programme forms the annex to this paper. The programme contains many praiseworthy although ill-defined proposals for the reform of conditions in Persia, and is designed to appeal to the progressive sections of Persian public opinion. I am sure that my colleagues will feel in sympathy with many of the objects of the Tudeh programme and will agree that it should continue to be our policy to encourage their realisation wherever possible. This is, of course, in accord with His Majesty’s Government’s general policy in social and economic matters in the Middle East, and His Majesty’s representatives in Tehran have in the past frequently urged on successive Prime Ministers in Persia the necessity of introducing such reforms. With regard to the Tudeh Party, I must point out that it must be judged by its practice and not only by its programme. Its activities in Persia have recently given cause for the gravest concern. The party has been used by the Russians as their instrument in Persia for subverting the authority of the Central Govern ment and for promoting the Secessionist Movement in Azerbaijan. The party’s leaders have willingly lent themselves to this, and the success which they have achieved has been largely due to the intimidation of the Central Government by the Soviet representatives in Tehran, and during the occupation by the Soviet Military Authorities in North Persia. At present the influence which the Tudeh Party has in the labour movement in South-West Persia is being used at Soviet instances to undermine British influence there. I am considering as a matter of urgency means of winning the labour movement over to us. I should add that the present Persian Prime Minister has just formed a new political party called the Democratic Party of Persia. This party also has a progressive programme which in the main is similar to the Tudeh Party’s and goes into rather fuller detail than does the Tudeh programme. I propose to watch progress of this new party and to give it every encouragement if it shows itself sincere in applying its policy of reforms. Extract from the Tehran Newspaper “ Rahbar of the 28th February, 1944. giving the Tudeh Party Programme for the 14th Persian Parliament. THE Tudeh members of the Majlis have published their programme. They have no personal interests, but have entered the Majlis to consolidate the happi ness and protect the forgotten rights of the nation—to spread the voice of Iran E. B. Foreign Office, S.W.l, 17th July, 1946. ANNEX. 13440 [32153]2 other freedom-loving Deputies, a stronghold for the defence of the nation s rights. Of course, it cannot be expected that all the hopes of the Iranian people will be accomplished in the present session; therefore the Tudeh members have based their programme on the minimum of the reforms necessary, these are:— 1. To defend to the utmost the independence of Iran and the integrity of its soil. True independence is indissolubly linked up with economic independence^ They therefore support the extension of new national industries, the acquisitioi^ of economic and vital sources and the use of the natural resources of Iran. Economic independence is essential to political independence. 2. All Iranian soil should be in the hands of Iranians. 3. “Freedom for all, bread for all, education for all, hygiene for all.' Freedom in its true sense should rule in this country, especially freedom of assembly. Parties should be persona juridica. These four principles should not be exclusive to a favoured few but within the reach of every individual. 4. Strengthening of the force of the country, and protection of the people against poverty and injustice. Tudeh members will bring before the Majlis projects for combating alcohol, opium, prostitution and venereal disease, for pecuniary help to the poor to enable them to marry, and to persons with large families, in order to further the increase of the population. 5. Combating the corruption, peculation and bribery with which the country is riddled. To this end, bread must be assured, men must be free, and education and hygiene universal. The maximum penalties for bribery and embezzlement must be enforced, especially in the case of high officials. The following are the measures which the Tudeh members desire the Majlis to pass. They are regarded as minimum demands :— Labour Law .—To establish proper relations between employer and employed; to ensure that the worker can resist any diminution in his pay; to see that his wages are not stopped in case of sickness, and that compensation for injury shall also be paid to him. Employment Law .—The Civil Service Law is obsolete; it does not consider the younger generation or the honest men. A radical revision, and the cancella tion of illogical regulations are necessary. Employees in private establishments should be assured of their future and of just treatment. Election Law. —This should be revised. Tudeh oppose the project to deprive illiterates of the vote. Because of the redistribution of population the old electoral districts are no longer valid and should be revised. The number of electors in each district should be established before elections start, to prevent trickery. Election period should be reduced to the minimum and elections should begin and end at the same time all over the country. Judicial Reform. —Abolition of special courts such as the Administrative Court (Diwan-i-Kifar) and the Financial Tribunals; and revision of the competence of military courts. Total annulment of laws and regulations damaging to the country; and especially of the wrong interpretation of article 72 of the fundamental law, which has prevented the independence of judges. Revision of the Penal and Criminal Courts Law. Simplification of Judicial Organisation Laws. Agricultural Re/orra—Purchase of Crown lands and large properties from owners by Government, and handing over of them to farmers against payment in instalments. Amendment of Agricultural Law to ensure just division of produce between landlords and peasants. An improvement project spread over several years; extension of husbandry and industrialisation, enhancement of economic strength; repair of old aque ducts and conduits and digging of new ones, generation of electric current, extension of road making and farm lands. Strengthening of National Economy. —Adjustment of taxes, taking into account the resources of the majority of the nation. Reinforcement of Government monopolies. In particular, Tudeh members oppose the sale of factories to persons when, in the decision of the 13th Majlis, such sale would be against the national interest.3 Reinforcement of internal industries. Encouragement of commerce, to increase exports. Limitation of rates of profit and prevention of speculation. Amendment of Municipal Laws .—^Extension of municipal vote to all individuals. Direct election. Election of Mayors by, and from among the members of, municipal councils. Extension of powers of municipal councils in drawing up their budgets, and in reforms and matters likely to secure the public interest; and also in solving local problems outside the competence of the Government. EducatiAyn .—Project for the bringing into force as soon as possible of free universal education. Stress is laid on the reformation of school curricula, with regard to civic education and the fostering of the democratic spirit and true patriotism. Military ,—Reform of military organisation, leading to the formation of a strong national army to maintain internal security and the independence of Iran. Hygiene. —A Bill for the extension of hygiene, especially in villages, and free medical care for poor people. Tudeh members of the Majlis will not cease their efforts to protect the rights of the nation. To-day all lovers of freedom must unite and co-operate for the happiness of Iran. The Tudeh Deputies will co-operate with all other freedom-loving Deputies for the reforms the nation needs.■ ,&lt;&gt;ot' INDEXED FILE COPY 0 // C This tel^grau is of particular secrecy and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed i n] i cypH-s ] c^;., :r ,: .j ?o ? :j,*|f 1.0. 179 83rd July, 194fi.

Paruqif who acted as spokesman, commenced by saying that the Indians had many grievances against the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and that they were unable to obtain any real satisfaction through the many representations they had submitted to their ielfare Officer, ,u 5 hgar i^li; that Indiana who made a haoit of making complaints were adversely reported on and often found themselves transferred to other localities. Their grievances included such matters as the Club, Welfare, General treatment, Accommodation, Transport, Increments, xo &gt;d, Medical, tj.., and they had therefore decided to form an Indian Labour Union with the intention of placing their demands before the Company* I attach a copy of a letter I received from Faruqi yesterday morning by i post during the actual discussions which explains their grievances Ht more length. I pointed out firstly that they were in a foreign country and had no legal right to form a Union until regulations had been issued under the lav/ governing the formation of Unions, and secondly that it would not be in their interests to form a Union which would.give the impression that it had a political background and was in any way com with the Tudeh movement. I said that I had received reports to the effect that a number of Indians had been attending the fudeh meetings and could only conclude that they had allowed themselves to become imbued with Communist ideas. Faruqi admitted that this was in some measure correct and that although they had no real intention of allying themselves with the Tudeh *&gt;arty, many of them felt that this was the only way to obtain redress; they had no one else to turn to and they could not go on living under the present conditions. The,' hotly denied that they were in any way connected with the GonfiTiunist activities; all they were concerned about was the amelioration of Indiar Labour conditions. I then told them that I had been informed by the Anglo-lranian Oil iny that it was ted that the Indian employees had certain grievances, but that they were not serious and that in any event Indian Labour was much better off than rersian. It vas the Company 1 ® policy, and quite rightly, to concentrate on improving conditions for their Persian Labour in the first instance, and then to turn their attention to general improvements for all Labour. This would not necessarily mean that nothing would be done o the Indians in the near future; every attempt would certainly be lade to improve their lot: but it must be borne in mind that it would not be possible for the Company to do everything at once, and that it would take time to bring about any tangible results so far o.s the ,r concerned. Jhey readily admitted tnat there was much force in hese arguments. I then pointed out that one 01 the main concerns of the ConsulAn ^horrwtehklr was the welfare of the Indian Community in '2* « m Plojr and tnat this was the first occasion on which they had th^t£ hea the tc 1Tly knowledge. How was the Consul to know egr ere in difficulties J.f they never approached him?Consul was in daily touch with the senior officials of the A*!• 0«0« and with the local authorities, and by virtue of his position he could use his influence to safeguard their interests. They should not go away with the idea, however, that every complaint which they put before the Consul would necessarily be taken up with the Company and remedied, that was beyond the Consuls power, and in any case the Consul would be bound to act ;.iore in the role of an arbitrator keepin, the interests of both the Company and their employees in mind* Wow that they had approached me I would do everything in my power to assist them in their efforts to ootain redress of legitimate and grievances* 3y associating with disruptive elements certain Indians had merely given themselves a bad name and had caused grave concern both to the AIOC and myself. Now was the time, I argued, for them to prove their loyalty to the Company by co-operating with them and taking up a completely different attitude with regard to their grievances. If they were to show a change of heart I was tiure that the Company would be only too willing to let bygones be bygones and do their best to improve conditions for them. If they continued to rely on revolutionary tactics as a means to attain their ends, they vrould only succeed in bringing endless trouble on themselves and their fellow employees in this countr, • Furthermore such methods might well result in certain agitators' being dinrnissed as undesirables, and these elements might possibly find things difficult for them on their return to their native country. They would only have themselves to blame in such an' eventuality. I concluded my argu lents by impressing on them that they should do their utmost to uphold the great traditions oi' their homeland, and set about removing once and for all ny unfavourable impressions that some of them had been instrumental in creating in ‘these areas. 4. I am glad to be able to report that the four representatives admitted wlioleheartedl, that they had been wrong in the past. They never, fully appreciated the fact that the Consul was here to help them; it was the general impression amongst the Indians that the Consul merely assisted the AIOC in removing undesirables etc. etc. They assured me that in future they would co-operate fully with the Company and cease to associate with the Tudeh. .ould I however come to their Club next Friday and have a talk with some of their fellow workers? I replied that I would be happy to do so. They also agreed, on my suggestion, that if they were in any doubt while drawing up a list of grievances, they would come and discuss them with me. Faruqi then asked if I could give them an assurance regarding the protection of Indian lives and property. I replied to the effect that His Iiajesty f s Government were naturally concerned with the safety of ail British and British Indian interests. b. Immediately after this interview, I went across to the aICC offices in Abadan and discussed the matter with some of the senior official' of the Company. On my advice they have agreed to take no further action against Furuqi for the present and to wait and see if he is prepared to honour the assurances he had given. Faruqi had also stated that they would give the same assurances to the Company and I suggested to the Company that they would be well advised to make sane gesture to show that they appreciated this change of attitude. Certain officials of the i.I.O.C. are ps a li impossible to accede to various requests. There is the case of the Labour Offiet r, i.shgar ,11 for instance. The .nlOG will hear nothing against him and consider he is a most reliable and efficient man. They do not appear to pay enough attention to the other side of the picture. The AlGC admit that he passes on /certain.. • •certain grievances and that they often as not have to reply with a definite NO* vhich is then communicated to the men# »ith the changing tines, I doubt whether this procedure is sufficient. by which the Indian workers grievancee are dealt with, and I ^ hesitate to give any definite opinion in the natter; but I intend to explore the possibilities of advocating some improvement in the present system and will report developments in due course* . nee writ in the above, the a ICC have informed me that Faruqi paid a visit to some of his Tudeh friends last night# For some reason /rtiich is not yet apparent, they refused to back any of his schemes# There are a number of loyalists amongst the Indians, and it is thought that Faruql is now most concerned about his own safety# He had already expressed this fear in an indirect vay . discretion is the better port of valour and has submitted his resignation, and so has his [tenant# The A IOC are naturally relieved at this turn of events and are taking steps to send them off to hasra in the near future, and if possible to fly Faruqi back to India from there. 7# The A ICC have welcomed my suggestion that I should pay a visit to the Artisan’s Club# They say that they had already suggested that the Indians should form a Committee for the express purpose of tabulating their grievances and that this offer had been tume \ down fuimEiarily by Faruqi who at that time \ms relying on 'ucleh support. They also refainied me that their long term policy is eventually to replace Indian Labour v/ith • This is in accordance with their Agreement with the *ersian Government who periodically bring this fact to their notice* Indian labour is very highly pai in comparison with iersian and it is recognised by the majority of Indians that this high rate of pay is a of recompense for the fact that the Company are not able to ’concentrate more on improving their living e&lt; tions* 8* In the m ime, it is hoped that from now onwards there will be a change for the better in the relations between the A IOC and their Indian Labour; but only time will show if a change of heart really takes place* y of thi de« .7 Oalhlf the Honourable the *olitieal esident in the iersian Gulf; and to His Majest, ? oas -&lt; eneral at ^hwaz* I have the honour to be ( ,g ., . , illoujiby ^horr *.nr. . :r-.COPY IP w ' P t j -iV X 51 03 &gt; The Consul British consulate, orrarashahr* •Abadan 26th June 1946 &lt;*3 &gt;ir.

My telegram No. 1090. I saw the Prime Minister this morning as arranged. Owing to his recent illness I had not seen him since July 1st. Though still weal: he is obviously convalescent* 2. I began by deploring the recent disorders on properties of the Anglo-Ironian Oil Company but expressed appreciation of the firm manner in which the situation had been handled on July 11-th but for which the casualties might have been a great deal more numerous. Referring to the Persian Government's note of last night about the arrival of His Majesty's ships in Shatt el Arab (my telegram N o. 1100 to F oreign Office). I said that so far as I was aware they were not in Persian waters but in view of the large number of British lives and the extent of British property in the area we are bound to provide agaist all contingencies. In spite of the good start made by local authorities we were by no means out of the wood yet.

Repeated to Middle East Office Cairom - 2 - but v/as a deliberate challenge to legally constituted authority. Whatever the Governor General’s reasons r.iay have been for releasing on Monday the Political ring leaders arrested on the previous night the affect had undoubtedly been to v/calcen his authority and I expressed the hope that the Priuc Minister in whatever way seemed best to him would see that it v/as speedily reaffirmed (I understand that Governor General did in fact agree to release of these prisoners under pressure fromFirouz). 5. The Prime Minister essired me most earnestly that ho had done and would continue to do everything possible to support and strengthen Governor General’s authority and provide absolute security for all British lives and property in this area. He enumerated measures already talc on (my telegram No. 1071) said the situation was already well in hand. The Military Governor had intimated that further reinforcements were unnecessary but never theless an additional battalion was already on its way. While the evidence so far adduced against prisoners released had been insufficient to warrant their continued detention he was far from satisfied of their innocence and was sending a special commission to Abadan to investigate their case. It seemed to me that the Prime Minister trod delicately at this stage but I thought it was wiser not. to pin him down, ns regards the two ships his note of last night had, he said, been intended to remind me of the legal position and it seemed to me that he was faintly apologetic at this. He then went on to ask for early withdrawal of both vessels from Shatt el nrab. Their presence was superfluous and they were weakening rather than /strengthening-o- stron^thcning his hrjicl. ‘i. I thcailiocl the Priac Ilinistor for his assurance and without co'U-iittin^ aysolf undertook to transmit to you his mussaye about the ships. I assured him that nothiny could be further from our intention than to ayyravate the present situation or to infrinyo Persian sovereignty. At the same time it was only natural tha,t v/g should feel compelled to take every possible precaution to protect British lives and property until law and order had been completely and C demonstrably restored. In response to my enquiry the Prime minister assured me most emphatically that he had no intention of instructing the Governor General to suspend martial law. Governor General had, he said, complete discretion in this matter. He spoke with such emphasis that it would have been superfluous to press him for an assurance that Hisbah Fatimi would be retained in office. Indeed I fear that further in sistence on this point at present stage might do Hisbah Fatimi more harm than good. 5. General impression which I derived was that Prime Minister is really anxious to vindicate authority of Government in Khujistan but is not yet strong enough to enforce his will on his subordinates particularly on Moussafir Firouz. As a result, the situation, though improving is still incalculable* Foreign Office please pass to Government of India and Washington as my telegrams d ,2 and 325.

Following is text of supplementary Questions and lUisweP^T 1 ^ [Begins] . . . Mr. Warbey : Has the Foreign Secretary made any representations to the Persian .Government regarding the repressive-'character of this new labour law, which seriously-curtails the right to strike and would not be tolerated in this-country in peace-time. Mr, Bevin s ,1 have not interfered with the'''Persian Government at all, and it is not my intentions to do so. I think it is better for all other Governments to allow them to exercise their own powesfs* Sir W. Sm ithers: •• Can the Right Hon. Gentleman say to what ex'teh(fiftiese troubles are caused by the intrigue.and propaganda of the Soviet Government? Mr. Bevin : I have not enquired into it ( . Mr. Galla cher: In view of the situation which has developed will the Foreign Secretary consider publishing the reports of the delegations sent over to study the trade union position. Mr. Bevin: I will look into it, but I have not had time to read it myself? Since I became Minister of Labour, and since I have been Foreign Secretary I have taken every step open to me to see that proper conditions are observed in the oil areas of Persia. Mr. A. Lewi s: Would it be creating a precedent to malce representations to a foreign Government where British interests are involved? Mr, B evin: It is not improper, but I think that when labour Taws have been carried by the Government at the request of the workers in the country, I ought not to interfere* Mr.^JCeeling: Is the Right Hon. Gentleman aware that IHe fhgTo-Iranian Oil Company have the reputation of being the best employers in Persia. Mr. Beviji: I am not prepared to say what is the best,‘'but 1 aim prepared to admit that in all the companies in Persia there is room for improvement.

The exchange of telegrams between the Transfer Office and the Persian telegraph office was discontinued about 10 months ago, but the Transfer Office had not been closed, and it was suggested therefore that since it no longer serves a useful purpose and is the subject of misrepre entation, it should be closed at once. The Government of India have replied that they are see .ing information regarding the present arrangements at .ahidan, but that in the meantime instructions have been issued for the closure forthwith of the Transfer Office.

(Ref. ray telegram No.945) Foreign Office, Whitehall, S.A.i.fN °£x&amp;o REPORT OR IHCIDENT AT AGHA. J, AROLO XRARIAN OIL COMP ARY ON JBN&amp;i. On the morning of 26th Juno a light lorry f whilst ^ proceeding through Agha Jari, ran off the road and capsized, with the result that about seven men were injured* They were taken to the dispensary in Agha Jari, and in spite of all efforts on behalf of the Persian doctor, Latiff, one of the injured, who had received serious head and body injuries, died. 2* The Fields Superintendent, Mr* Goodall* had been notified at once of the incident and had offered to send out a surgeon at once to the dispensary* There was however no time for such action* 3, During the course of the above proceedings a large crowd had assembled in and about the dispensary, and the Persian Staff Representative, having advised Mr. Goodall that the man had died, claimed that he had not been given medicine. In a very heated manner he requested Mr. Goodall to visit the dispensary, which the latter agreed to do. On his arrival lie found that the 0.0. Gendarmerie was present but was quite ineffective to maintain order amongst the crowd. The doctors present coiifirmed that all the necessary medicines and instruments to treat the injured man were available. Having satisfied himself that everything possible had been, and was being done, Mr. Goodall returned to his office. 4* After lunch on the same day, however, Persian Staff Representatives burst into the office of Mr. Goodall. After raving in an incomprehensible manner, the chief representative called a crowd from the verandah and the situation became ugly. The O.C. Gendarmerie had again been sent for by the Company representative, but was quite ineffective. The main complaints being voiced were the shortage of water, housing, and the refusal of the Company to ameliorate the condition of the workers. At this stage, and quite by chance, the O.C. of the Troops from Dehbehan, Colonel Parsitabar, arrived and was hustled. He was requested to leave the premises, and when he refused to do so, was seized, forced out of the office and placed into a car which drove him away* Mr. Goodall, at the same time, was manhandled but managed to release himself* He was ordered to leave and threatened with death if he refused to do so* He managed, by addressing himself directly to the workers, to restore order* 5* It should be added that, during the course of this disturbance, the Persian workmen stated that they did not owe allegiance to the Central Tudeh Party or to the Unions in Abadan or M.I*S. but intended to take control themselves. 6. The above facts were reported to the headquarters at Abadan* The Management considered it desirable at a late hour on Wednesday to wake up the Under-Secretary fbr Commerce, M. Aramesh, who happened to bo in the area, together with the designated Director-General fbr Labour, Aghai Kaviani, and Aghai Saqaffi* The Company representatives pointed out that the disturbance threw a vivid light on the lack of FILE CCP.V 1 [ OIL-FIELD OF SDNESIAY, 26TH /securitysecurity in the oilfield area and stated that they wore seriously considering closing down at Agha Jari and evacuating women and children forthwith ffom the area unless positive steps could be taiaen to reassert the authority of the Government* The Under—Secretary agreed entirely with the viev/ of the Company and undertook to explain the circumstances to the Prime Minister immediately on his return to Tehran on 27th June* He meanwhile instructed Aghai Kaviani to proceed to Agha Jari to investigate the incident and restore order* Aghai Kaviani did not in fact proceed to Agha Jari as directed, but it is understood that Aghai Bagaffi went instead of him and will submit a report to his Department*RLfc. oUr * 1 * ‘ * '} x.ep Of \ ! , (•'. f -j 1 A o I v/ / ”? 9 yv 4-^&gt;e [This telegram is Vr’^particursT^ecrecy and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on] lU [CYPHER] CtiBINET DISTRIBUTION D. 9.16 1946. lU^tUSHala, l£Uh&lt;ruly7 1946.

General strike in Khuzistan oilfields. According to reports received from Khuzistan the situation is as follows. A general strike of the workers of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company began on July 14th. Martial law was declared by the Persian Government authorities at 0800, the work of removing strikers pickets was begun and measures were taken to ensure the maintenance of essential public services. During the evening of July 14th following the lynching of an Arab merchant there was a clash between local Arabs and Tudeh supporters resulting in casualties at present reported as 17 killed and 150 wounded, and in the destruction of some property. During July 15th the strike continued but no further development has been reported. M. Muzaffer Firuz representing the Prime Minister, M. Aramosh the Acting Minister of Commerce and representatives of the Tudeh party arrived at Abadan in the evening. Although friendly discussions were in progress regarding conditions of abour no demands were presented to the Company by the workers efore the strike began and it therefore seems clear that it has ~en organised for purely political reasons.

I also enclose a copy of a telegram from His Majesty’s Consul at Zahidan reporting another sudden outburst of religious fanaticism. 3. In each instance the local Tudeh Party seem to have played a sinister part; and to have done their best to exploit the situation to create dangerous disorders. I have the honour to be wi th the highest respect, Sir, Your meat obedient humble Servant, (Sgd.) J.H. Lb KOUGKTbL The Right Honourable Ernest Bevin, His Majesty’s Principal Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, LONDOF, M.P., ol Sta S.vV.l.7./ 5Zg Ho. 16 (014B/37/46) Sir, r Bl ■ ' 4813 4R Mr wt.l %-» #*'» • British Consulate-Qoneral, AHWAZ. 26th June, 1946. In continuation of my recent telegram concerning the riot at Ahwaz on Friday last, the 21st June, I have the honour to submit to ^ ,ar Excellency a detailed report giving all the details I nave succeeded in obtaining hitherto concerning that event. 2. At about noon the landlord of a house in the Pahlevi Street of Ahwaz raised an outcry by shouting ”0 Islam, 0 religion ana other similar expressions, implying that Islam was in danger from infidels, and Incited a crowd of hawkers and loafers standing by (as Is u sm al in that crowded street on Fridays) to attack the upper store,/ ol tre houa e. With remarkable alacrity they began to destroy all the property in the upper storey, tearing up all the books and smashing the windows, the chairs and even the doors. It appears * i a^ tenants of the upper storey were well known as sympathisers with the Kasravi movement, which, in spite of the assassination of its leader Kasravi in a Tehran Court of law early this year, evidently still exists here and carried on propaganda. It will be remembered that the Kasravis are said to be iconoclasts professing contempt for most if not all of the traditions of the country: they say that all ancient Persian literature such as Sa’adi, Hafez, and Ferdausi ought to be destroyed, and their enemies say that they also advocate the abandonment of Islam. The landlord had previously discovered that his tenants had been burning some papers in their rooms, and imagined what they had been destroying was copies of the Qoran. 3 . At the same time a party attacked the book-shop of a certain Qmid, situated in the same street. Omid, who is no relation oi the notorious Tudeh agitator All Omid, has had dealings with this Consulate-General on various occasions and held a certain stock of our publicity material, amounting in value to about 67 tor a ns. TLe\ destroyed all his property, including his books, his stationery, and even the door of his shop. 4. Another party attacked a house owned by a certain Seyyid Jamal \ Jazayeri, situated in a neighbouring street. This man, although the son of a mujtahid, has the reputation of being a strong supporter of , the principles of the Kasravi sect. His house was similarly treated. Nothing was taken away but everything was broken and tom. Some neighbours complained that their belongings were also broken. 5 . Finally, a photographer’s shop named 'Farhang' owned by a certain Sanehi, situated in the 'Falakeh' square near the Karun bridge and not far from this Consulate-General office, was broken Into and its contents destroyed. The proprietor is known as a Kasravi supporter. 6 . The police appear to have done their beat to stop these disgraceful attacks: one Police Major received a slap in the face. Some troops were also present, and the rioting, which had started about 12 noon, was all over by about 2 p.m. It is reported that during the disorders shouts of 'Long live the workers’ party' were heard, and a man named Zand, an active Tudeh member, is said to have told the Police officer that if he attempted to threaten them with revolvers they had Tommy Guns which they were prepared to use. I also hear that a man named Ra’isi, formerly a prominent Tudeh party official but now in bad odour with the party owing to some embezzlement of party funds attributed to him, was heard endeavouring to make a speech saying it was useless to break such articles, and it would be much better to vanquish Mr. Churchill and his followers. No damage to life or limb is reported.7. Three announcements were quickly printed and circulated in the town of Ahwaz* A roneoed statement by the '’Free men of Ahwaz' (a name used by the followers of Kasravl) complained about this savage action against them and compared it to similar action taken against the Kasravis in Tabriz and Abadan, proving that it was the Judeh Party which was responsible. The two other statements emanated from the Tudeh and the Sa^det parties. Stripped of the usual bombastic and meaningless anfractuosities their purport was as follows: The Tudeh manifesto blamed the Sa f adat party on the ground that they had staged an Arab demonstration at Ahwaz on that day: it also quoted a letter from Xli Omid (calling him 'rafiq' - 'comrade' - a word which connotes'a Russian sympathiser) dissociating himself from that demonstration. The Sa f adat party*s manifesto of course accused the Tudeh Party of the entire responsibility for the riots, and scored an easy point by pointing out that the riots took place from 12 noon to 2 p.m. on the 21st June, whereas the Arab demonstration did not even start till 5 p.m. and moreover took place about two miles outside the town where the riots took place. Finally the Sa f adat party mentioned with pride that it is a Persian party, and its members are neither 'rafiqs' nor 'misters'. 8 . Investigations and interrogations are still going on in the police office, and the landlord (named Saffar) who started the attack on the Kasravi headquarters, is under arrest. Appropriate representations about the publicity material destroyed have been made by me to the acting Governor General and to the head of police. It seems best to regard this riot as principally an anti-Kasravi outbreak which suddenly flared up in the present atmosphere of strained nerves: . but the Tudeh party cannot escape a certain degree of responsibility as the majority of the hooligans ifrio did the actual work of destruction were just the elements whom the Tudeh party have been exploiting for the past few weeks. 9* I am sending a copy of this despatch to H.M.

Medical examination shows that boy was strangled and thrown there. There are reasons to believe some members of local Bahai community were responsible for the crime. Tudeh agitators made the most of the occasion and consequently an angry mob of 2,000 strong armed with knives, axes and clubs, gathered in the main bazaar on June 25th and decided to attack and loci Bahais. House of a Bahai was actually attacked and contents looted but no one was injured. Military was called to order /sic/ and guard property of the Bahais.

Soviet Press on 2nd under heading 'Persian paper on situation in Khuzistan' paints Tehran Tass report that a special number of paper 'Zafar' was devoted on 28th June to situation in Khuzistan. 2 . Paper accuses Arab chiefs of having received up to -50.000 rials each from British Intelligence sources for the struggle against 'democratic organisations in Khuzistan', while following on conversation between Anglo-Iranian Oil Company representative and Governor of Khuzistan, 50 soldiers were despatched to a village of company workers to liquidate a trades union. 3. British are further alleged to have turned Abadan into a State within a State with its own police and taxes, and a levy of 200 rials from cars travelling between Abadan and Khuzistan. According to the paper, the British fire service, which stops cars* is really a branch of the Intelligence Service, and British police carry out searches of flats in absence of their owners* 4. Concluding, paper demands that Persian Government should denounce existing concession treaty and conclude a new one strictly controlling Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.

After reviewing the work of his Administration he announced that he was forming a new political party to be called the Democrat Party of Persia which would begin activity throughout Persia in a fortnight's time. The Party's policy would be made clear in its programme but in regard to his foreign policy he wished to give additional explanations. 3. He desired to base this policy on good relations with all friendly powers especially with the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the United States of America but he wished to make clear what he held to be the essential conditions of good relations. 4. In the past Persia had suffered many offences against her right and independence. In future Persia's sovereignty- 2 - sovereignty and independence must be protected. She must no more suffer the treatment of the strong with the weak and there must be no more foreign interference in her internal affairs in the name of friendship or on the pretext of protecting her independence. 5. He was determined to defend the real independence of the country and to make abstention from interference in Persia's internal affairs a condition of good relations with all countries. Persia must be master of her own destiny. 6 . Referring to reactionary opposition in Persia to reforms he warned those concerned that the hands of the clock of time could not be put back.

It is reported that the Russians have recently purchased 60,000 sheep and goats in Khorassan through a Jewish source and exported them to Russian territory. A Mullah started to preach against this action of the Russians which he^aid is denuding Khorassan of sheep and goats. The Soviet-Consul-General is said to have apprached Ustandar and demanded that this kind of agita tion and publicity should cease forthwith. 2. Tudeh propaganda for the coming elections is proceeding vigorously. It is anti-British, anti- American and in fact anti-everything which is not Russian There has been violent abuse of Churchill on account of his last speech. 3. Reference last paragraph of situation report No.19, Manuchehr Aimurtash who has come to Meshed is reported to be starting a radical socialist party and has published its programme. 4. Five buses on the way to Tehran from Meshed were held up and looted near Sabzav/ar on about June- 2 - Jane 15th by armed robbers, two of whom have been caught. About the same time a clash was reported between robbers and gendarmerie on Turbat-i-Haidari road in which one gendarme was shot* 5. The Chinese Consul at Meshed had received telegraphic instructions to proceed to Tehran immediately to take over charge of Chinese Embassy as Chinese Ambassador has been ordered to Siam to open a Chinese Embassy there. 6 .

Mr. Busk said that we had similar information. Dr. Jamali asked what attitude the Iraqi Government should, in the Counsellor’s opinion, adopt. 2* Mr. Busk said that speaking privately it seemed to him as regards (a) that the Tudeh Party policy was not in the interests of either ourselves or the Iraqi Government. We had an immense stake in South Persia and could not risk trouble there. If serious trouble arose it would spread across the river to Basra, a point which Counsellor had previously mentioned to the Iraqi Prime Minister who had been alarmed because of the fertile field for propaganda created by flood conditions in Basra. Dr. Jamali also saw the force of this. Mr. Busk added that he had spoken similarly to the Minister of the Interjoar, but had since learnt that efforts on Tudeh lines were being made to stir up workers at Kirkuk, .nil this seemed to him very b ad and he felt sure- 2 - tlMt any opposition to Tad eh was in the intere-Stis of ourselves, the Iraqis, and the Persians. He hoped that the Persian prime Minister would he able, now that he had reached an agreement over Azerbaijan, to turn his attention to the Tudeh. He would certainly have the support of ourselves and the Americans. 3. As regards the attitude of Iraq, Mr. Busk said that he thought thau it would be a mistake for the Iraqi Government to support the Arabs in Khuzistan. Iraq Government might feel that these Arabs were performing a good service in fighting the Tudeh, but any Iraqi Government support for them would be interpreted as separatist and political support. The Persian Government had enough on their hands already v/ithout this additional complexity. Surely the best course for the Arabs in Khuzistan was to fight the Tudeh, informing the Central Persian Government that they proposed to do so, and that they hoped when the battle was won that the Persian Government v/ould consider granting them some degree of local self-government.. Mr. Busk warned Dr. Jamali, however, that he did not think that the Azerbaijan analogy was fair. In Khuzistan the number of Arabs involved was comparatively small and there were no clear-cut dividing ethnic lines. In fact the pack was vexy pretty well shuffled. -t. A general discussion followed on how to combat Communism, in which Hr. Busk stressed the importance of improving the condition of the poorer people in Iraq. Only by constructive measures could the danger be effectively met. Dr* Jamali said he realised restrictive measures would be futile.Tehran please pass/to Foreign Office as my telegram No. 12 and to /government of India and Middle East Office as my telegram No. 57.

I remained s' ^ ^ ^ s' with him for over two hours during which he expressed intense anxiety about the present trend of events. In particular Tie is afraid the Government will resume negotiations with Pishavari under communist pressure and will shortly agree to a settlement which is tantamount \ ' s' to cession of Azerbaijan to Soviet Union, His Majesty not s' ^ s' ^ unnaturally considers that the exclusion from Azerbaijan of all gendarmerie and all military forces except military S' S' s' S s ^ commander and a few senior officers will entirely deprive Central Government of effective authority and must be resisted at all costs. He is, however, doubtful whether Prime Minister shares this view* S ^ S' ~S ^ ^ — 2. For motives which will be clear from my telegram No.643 I stated with extreme frankness all arguments I ' S' S ‘S’ s^ ss* could muster against a military solution and the Shah ^ ^ ^ S' t 0~ ... reluctantly admitted that they were unanswerable. He ^ s' ^ ^ ^ contended however, that if the Government were now to capitulate he would be unable to endorse their decision and would have to make a change.' Clearly this would be no easy matter and would almost certainly precipitate Communist /counterESKa - 2 - S 'counter measures which might be of a mo drastic nature, pa. &lt;&gt;' r s' ^ ^ .— \ 3.'Ill did not contest His Majesty's interpretation of the ^military formula favoured by Mo Prsdavaric For so far &amp; as I can 'judge it is entirely correct, I agreed with ‘ His Majesty moreover that the present situation was^ extremely dangerous and that action of some k;in_d was needed soon. If Prime Minister felt acceptance of Azerbaijani '' terms were incompatible with national interest bhe obvious course would,suggested, be for him to make a full and clear^public 'statement in which all essential facts would be ''laid bare and nobody's feelings 'would be unduly spared. If he still felt it necessary as in his last statement to avoid committing himself it would be transparently clear he was not a free agent. If, on the ohher hand, he decided S' ^ yS’ - ^ ^ ^ .— ■to make a full statement it would introduce an entirely new factor 'into the present confused situation, it was not for *«* ** ^ n n ^ me to suggest Y/hat action the Persian government should or should not take vis h vis Security Council. It would, however surely be quite possible for them to instruct M, Hussein Ala to make discreet enquiries about future procedure without ^ S' ^ committing them in any way. 4 . The Shah then reverted to his original theme and urged me to' do everything possible to stiffen the Prime Minister without delay* I pointed out that His Majesty had produced no conclusive evidence to shov/ that M* Qawam was about to capitulate but undertook to see him in the near future and, if it appeared to me necessary,Jo urge him not to'come to terms with 'Pishavari against his better judgment, I *p. ^ /5.-3- 5 ^\It has now'been arranged that I am to see the Prime Minister on May 18th and I propose then: ( 1 ) to ask for information about recent developments, ( 2 ) ^to deprecate once more the use of force on one hand or surrender on account of national interests on the other, ( 3 ) to urge the issue of a full and frank statement as S' soon as it becomes clear that deadlock is complete. s' 6 ./since the above was drafted the local press has reported^that the Persian Government are considering despatch of representatives to continue conversations with Azerbaijani delegation.-' If this report (following as it does'on M. Pishavari's statement summarised in my telegram No.683) is correct it would suggest that there is some substance^ in the Shah's apprehensions. ^Indeed I cannot believe any delegation despatched'to Tabriz at present could do more than to concede what has hitherto been withheld, in fact to sign upon the dotted line. ^ .

The reports cover developments within the Central Government, developments in the provinces, and the activities of the Democratic Party and the Tudeh Party. This includes accounts of meetings held by the British and United States Ambassadors – John Le Rougetel and George V Allen – with Ahmad Qavam (Prime Minister and Leader of the Democratic Party) and the Shah – Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. The file also covers strikes and labour disputes, with those affecting the operations of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company being particularly predominant.The strikes of oil workers in Agha Jari and Abadan in July 1946 are covered in the reports, as is a threatened revolt by the Bakhtiari and Kashgai tribes.
