Confidential. B« / ^ P.Z. 668V^ • SL^tns of Ba ajdii. The Tieraorandum attached sets out in some detail the relevant facts since 1720 in ^o far as they are on record bearing on the status of the British concession at Basidu in the Island of Kishm in the Persian Gulf. The concession in question is held under a written grant of 1820 from the Imam of Muscat, at that period in effective possession of Kii-hm. The essential point in issue is whether the Imam in making the grant in question in 1820 did so as sovereign of Kishm or in his capacity as a tenant of Persia. 2, Tne -natter was closely investigated in 1821, by an officer specially deputed to the Persian G-ulf consequent on Persian protests against the landing of a British detachment in the Island of Ki~hm under the authority granted by the Imam. Great difficulty was even at that period experienced in reaching any positive conclusion as to the strength or weakness of the Imam's claims to sovereignty. The aifficulty in establishing the true facts is hardly less to-day. A survev of the correspondence as a whole and of the history of the island of Kishm, in which Basidu is situated, in the century preceding 1820 tends to suggest that the basis for the Imam's claims is unsubstantial* 1780-1794. 3. According to Lorimer's Oazetteer of the Persian Gulf, which is the accepted authority on the history of the Grulf States, and which is based on exhaustive local researches some 30 years ago by an officer of the I.G«S. of great experience, it does not appear that the Arabs of the Oman Coast were much in evidence in/in the neighbourhood of Bandar AVoas, or anywhere on the Persian side of the GKilf, before the Afghan invasion of Persia which began in 1720. Consequent on the Afghan invasion in thai year the Arabs of the Trucial Ooast (also described on this occasion as the y Muscateers w ) established themselves in Basidu in the island of Kishm, in which they were attacked and defeated by a British naval force in April 1727. But Nadir Shah of Persia in 1737 not merely overran the South Persian coast, and so reimposed an effective Persian control over areas such as the island of Kishm, but extended his conquests across the Gulf and in 1737-8 occupied the Sultanate of Muscat, from which Persia v/as expelled only in 1744. 4. In 1747 the Persian Governor of Bunder Abbas and its dependencies entered into an alliance with the Jowasimi Arabs of the Trucial Arab coast; consequent on which those Arabs appear to nave established them selves between 1750 and 1765 in various posts in the island of Kishm. But they were expelled from Kishm about 1765 and the other dependencies of Bandar Abbas by Sheikh Abdulla, who had been appointed ruler of that area by the Persian Vakil in S. Persia, and they had not regained their position so late as 1780, 5. Prom the above it will be seen that there appears to have been no Arab connection of importance (as distinct from piratic raids) with the S. Persian CoaBt, and with Inlands such as Kishm, at any rate for a considerable period prior to 1720: that between 1720 and 1794 Arab invaders (apparently normally from the present Trucial Oman and not from the Muscat Imarnate) were established for varying periods the total of which does not appear to have exceeded some 20 years, in Kishm Island or in Basidu/Ba^- idu: that during the bulk even of that period they were in occupation as the mercenaries of the local Persian ruler; and that there is no suggestion at any stage of an abandonment by Persia of her claims to sovereignty over Bunder Abbas and its dependencies, including Kishm, It would appear difficult, if not impossible, on the facts recorded to base any Muscat claim to sovereignty over Kishm pn the history of that Island between 1720 and 1794 # im-i&amp;o- 6, In the year 1794, the Imam of Muscat x defeated the Bani Ma'in rulers of Kishm and Ormuz and consequent on this victory was able to secure the transfer to himself by Persia of the revenue lease of Bunder ^bbas and its dependencies. Precisely what was covered by the term '''dependencies 1 ' is not very clear. But there seema a very strong probability, almost amounting to a certainty, that it included the island of Kishm and so Basidu. Further, while the Imam appears to have secured the lease as a result of his victory over the Bani Ma f in it is to be noted that he secured from Persia a lease and not a grant, that a substantial annual rental was paid for the lease and that, according to Lorimer, ' y a surety for payment seems to have been required by the Persian (jovernment/Government from the Saiycd and to have been provided by him in the person of a Persian merchant or banker named Haji Xhalat 11 . The liulers of Muscat temporarily lost control of some, if not all, of the areas covered by the lease, on the death of Saiyed Sultan in 1804, and while they were to some extent reinstated with British support in 1805 and again in 1806 the available records do not make it clear whether they in fact exercised effective dominion even as tenants of Persia in the whole of the area covered by their revenue lease of 1794 so late as 1818. In the latter year the pirate i^abs of the Trucial Coast, who are not under Muscat control, were apparently proposing to establish themselves at Basidu as a stronghold which could be held against the Egyptians, and were led to abandon this intention largely because of the defeat by one of the last India Company's ships of one of their squadrons towards the end of that year. 7, This record suggests that while the ruling family of Muscat did indeed secure from Persia in 1794 a revenue lease which almost certainly included the island of Kishm, their effective occupation of that island prior to the grant in 1820 by the Imam, quoted in paragraph 21 of the Memorandum attached,, was subject to lengthy interruptions. It would be as difficult in these circumstances to base any claim by Muscat to absolute ownership or sovereignty in Kishm on the history of the period 1794 to 1820 as it would to base a similar claim on the history of the island in the period 1720 to 1794. 'OnrrespondcnQG of 1819 to 18^. 8. When the Govommont of Bombay decided in 1819 that in the interests of the suppression of piracy it would be advantageous to establish a central station in the G-ulf and that the island of Kishm was geographically the best situate-a lor this purpose, the question of the status oi the island at once came up for consideration. The correspondence which passed between the Local Grovernment, their officers in the Persian Gulf, and the Teheran Legation, the relevant extracts from which are contained in the memorandum attached, makes it clear that the views of the Government of Bombay as to the uncertainty of the Persian title to Kishm were sincere and real, and that when they finally so far deferred to the claims of Persia as to arrange that the British detachment should, be removed from Kishm, they did so formally without prejudice to the claims of the Imam of Muscat over that isl-^ncii The loading document on the subject is the report of 14th August 1821 by lir. Jukes, who was specially sent from Bombay to investigate this, among other aspects of the Kishm question, the Report, in view of its importance, is given in full in paragraph 29 of the memorandum attached* Dr. Jukes, while elaborating the arguments in support of the Muscat claim and in particular emphasising the statement made to him by the Confidential Secretary to the then Imam of Muscat that 'neither Kishm, Ormuz, nor Larak/6. larak arc specified on the receipts annually granted by the Persian G-ovcmraent for the stipulated sum paid to thcLV' and the Imam f s statement that 'the islands of Kishm. Ormuz and Larak belonged exclusively to the Imam' 1 , admits that he was unable ''to obtair a sight of the old Persian Ihirmauns by which His Highness the Imam farms Bunder i.bbassee from the Sovereign of Persia, in order to ascertain what places are particularly specified as constituting its dependencies. I thin 1 : it unlikely chat such an important document...should not be in existence; it is possible that it may have been mislaid at the time I was at Muscat or it might have been intentionally withheld.. . r&lt; Br. Jukes rightly concludes that 'the claims of Persia to the islands of Kishm, Ormuz, etc. seem to rest entirely upon their being considered as dependencies of Bunder iJDbassGC /and not on Persian claims as to suzertinty over Muscat itself/* Tiese points I have not yet been able to ascertain, but it is quite evident that the Imam is not disposed to acknowledge the right of Persia to the islands in question and it is, I believe, the universal lav/ of nations to claim as a right that which they have obtained by the sword,' 9. Dr. Jukes's premature death in November. 1821, and the fact that a modiis vivendi was for the moment reached by Persia in regard to the future of the British detachment appears to have prevented any more exact examination of the rival claims of Muscat and of Persia to the overlordship of Kishm being proceeded with. Ls will be seen, his remarks are by no means conclusive on the point now in issue. The Muscat claims to which he refers were unsupported by any documentary evidence, though this should/should not have been difficult to produce; in so far as those claims are based on right of conquest, (i.e. presumably on the forcible occupation by Muscat in 1794 of Bunder Abbas and its dependencies) they appear to be vitiated by the fact that the Imams of Muscat used their victory merely to secure a revenue lease and not a grant in sovereignty of the areas affected. Finally in estimating the importance of Dr. Jukes 1 s report, the comments on it of Mr. Lorimer, who in matters such as this speaks with authority, are relevant. He says 'As his (Dr. Jukes*5) investigations were conducted chiefly under the auspices of Oman officials, whose statements he would be inclined to accept., his report dated 14th August 1821 can hardly be regarded otherwise than as an ^ parte document, but as such it is of interest^. 10. The general effect of the correspondence which is set out m extonso in the accompanying memorandum is to suggest that there was in 1819 some degree of genuine doubt as to where the true title to Kishm lay, but that such doubts were based on statements made by the Imam of Muscat unsupported by any written document such as the text of the firman granting the revenue lease. On the facts available it is, I suggest, difficult to feel that the Muscat claim has been established, or that it has any solid foundation either in history or in law. Period 1B23 to 19S8. 11. It may be convenient briefly to refer to th more important points bearing on the question of title/8. title between the reoocupation of Basidu by in 1823 and the reassertion of a Persian claim in 1928# ihe most important are the terms of the re-lease of Bandar i ^bbas and its dependencies (including Xishm) by Persia to Muscat in 1855; articles 2 and 14 of the Treaty of Paris of 1857; the reference to Basidu in the Telegraph x -^greoment of 1864 with luuscat, the terms of the farther lease granted to Muscat by Persia in 1868, and the Government of India f s pronouncement as to the status of Basidu in 1868• 12. While the G-overnment of India T s pronouncement is of much importance as indicating the considered view taken by them at that period, it is conceivable that it may have been made without close enquiry into the claims of Muscat to sovereignty in Kishm - an issue which was probably in their view of little active importance, since in 1855 Muscat had abandoned any independent rights she might have had in Kishm to Persia; and it cannot of course by itself have any decisive value. Of greater importance are the Firmans of 1855 and 1868, the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1857, and the Telegraph Agreement of 1864; and the facts that; (a) the re-lease by Persia to Muscat of Bunder/Bunder iJDbas and its dependencies, .including specifically Kishm, in 1855 makes no reference to the British station at Basidu, although certain articles of the re-lease are so worded as to appear as being inconsistent with the retention by HJUG-* of military forces and stations in Basidu; (b) the Treaty of Paris provides for the evacuation by British troops in certain events which come to pass of 'all ports, places and is lands st belonging to Persia. Basidu was not however evacuated, nor does it appear that our failure to evacuate led to any remonstrance from Persia. (c) The telegraph agreement between HJI.Gr. and Muscat of 1864, specifically saves the Title of H.M *.Gr. s to Basidu J, that station having been freely granted to the British Government by my late father.,... - on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors'. (d) the re-lease of Bunder xxbbas of 1868 repeats and, if anything, emphasises the articles in the lease of 1855 referred to above., 13. It is noteworthy moreover that in the period J.823-1928 not only does it appear that there was no challenge even in general terms by Persia to our special position or rights in Basidu but that we appear in 1905 and again in 1930 to have referred without contradiction to the concession as British territory in communications to the local Persian customs officials.Conclusion. 14, The genoral impression left as the result of a close investigation of the relevant correspondence is that the claims of the Imam of Muscat to have held Kishm, and so Basidu in sovereignty at any recent period are probably ill founded, and that it would be difficult to fight a case on the material at our disposal; that on this assumption the grant to us of the island of Kishm (ultimately in practice restricted to the occupation of Basidu) in 182C was made by the Imam in his capacity of a tenant of Persia that this being the case Persia must be regarded as having tacitly confirmed in 1855 and again in 1868 the grant of the concession though without specifically prejudicing her own claims in regard to sovereignty; and that in the circumstances such rights as we may possess in the area and such title as we may be able to claim to it must be based on (a) unchallenged occupation for over a century; (b) the tacit recognition by Persia of our position constituted by the phrasing of the Persian Leases to Muscat of 1855 and 1868, Articles 2 and 14 of the Treaty of Paris of 1857, -Lrticle 6 of the -Joglo-Musoat Telegraph agreement of 1864, and such minor incidents as the assertions made apparently unchallenged by us from time to time that the station was British territory and its waters British territorial waters. It is for the Law Officers to advise, if/if.: !!• if the view suggested above as to the status of British Basidu is accepted as correct, whether we can decline to evacuate the concession save on our own terras in view of the length of the period of uninterrupted and unchallenged occupation, and the degree of recognition of our special position which the minor incidents referred to above might be held to constitute; and to say what if any rights we are entitled to exercise in it, and in particular whether we are justified in regarding it as British territory and its waters as British territorial waters, so long as we remain in possession^ J *Gr ,L.

According to Lorimer's Gazetteer the Arabs of the Omam Coast do not appear to have been much in evidence in the neighoourhood of Bunder Abbas or indeed on the Persian side of the Gulf before the Afghan invasion of Persia which began in 1720. About 1720 certain islands including apparently Kishm were seized by the 'Muscateers'. A Persian army under Luft Ali Khan was sent into the interior of Bunder Abbas but returned north to ICirman in consequence of the Afghan invasion of Persia without having effected anything,the Arab invaders apparently remaining in possession. 2. In April, 1727 a British naval expedition exacted compensation from the Jowasimi Shaikh Rashid (probably the Shaikh of Ras-el-Khaimah) for losses occasioned to the East India Company's factory at Bunder Abbas by the establishment by the Jowasimis of a naval port at Basidu. 3. In 1737 Nadir Shah of Persia crossed the Gulf and overran Oman from which the Persians were finally expelled only in 1744. In 1747 on the decease of Nadir Shah, Mullah Ali Shah, who had been Governor of Bunder Abbas and its dependencies under him called in the assistance of the Jowasimi Arabs to help him to maintain his position agdinst inter alios the hereditary ruler of Lar and appear to have entered into a sort of alliance with them which subsisted at least until 1763. It is probably (according to Lorimer) consequent on this that the Arabs of the Oman Coast obtained a foothold on6. © 2. Lor. 1.135 on the island of Kishm. In June 1760 the Jowasimi, who appear by then to have established themselves at Kishm and Luft in the island of Kishm and also at Lingah and Shanas on the coast of the 95. mainland to the west, assisted Mullah Ali Shah against Bunder Abbas, the fort of which was then held by the Khan of Lar. In 1763 Mullah Ali Shah is reported as being in possession of the fort of Kishm, the record stating also that he had spent all his suostance in the three previous years in subsidies to Ras-el-Khaimah, In the same year a treaty was concluded between the Bani Ma 1 in on the one side and Mullah Ali Shah and the Jowasimi Arabs on the other, one provision of which was that the revenues of Kishm should be equally divided between i.135 the three parties in future. 110 4. About 1765 Kerim Khan, Zand, the Persian Vakil of tliis area, had appointed Shaikh Abdulla of the i.633 1825 Local tribe or family of the Bani Ma'in (elsewhere described by lorimer as an Arab tribe, but Persian subjects) as Ruler over Bunder Abbas, Ormuz and Kishm, and this Shaikh, who was still ruling in 1780, i.633 succeeded about 1765 in expelling the Jowasimi and other intruders from his dominions and was able during his lifetime to keep them at a distance. In 1777 the Shaikh Sagar of Ras-el-Khaimah, on his accession, married a daughter of Shaikh Abdulla and so adjusted his differences with the Bani Ma'in family. i.144 5. In 1769 Kerim Khan, Zand, demanded and was refused a renewal of the tribute paid by Oman during the time of Nadir Shah, and hostilities arising from this refusal continued for some years after this date.6. In 1794 Saiyid Sultan, a new Ruler of Muscat, 1^144 found himself strong enough to add Swadur and Chahbar on the Makran coast to his dominions proper and consequent on his defeat of the Bani Mafin rulers of iCishm and Ormuz in a sea battle, to secure the transfer 148 i.421-23 to himself by Persia from the Sheikh of the Bani Ma T in, a Persian vassal, of the revenue lease of Bunder Abbas, and its dependencies. The dependencies at this state included, according to Lorimer, (who had of course before him the Muscat claim to Kishm and Ormuz referred to in Dr. Jukes 1 s report of August 1821 quoted in para. 29 below), Minab and the islands of ICishm, Ormuz and Hen jam; the lease 'if it was formally granted' appears to have been granted (probably, according to Lorimer, because it could not be refused) either by Aga Muhammad Khan, Qajar, or by Lutf Ali Khan Sand. The actual rental was probably not more at first than 4,000 dollars, the amount at which it still stood in 1821, A surety for its payment seems to have been required by the i ,422 Persian Government from the ruler of Muscat and to have been furnished by him in the person of a Persian merchant and banker named Haji Khelat, 7. In 1800-1801 Captain Malcolm when adjusting the i.175 Commercial Treaty with Persia endeavoured, but unsuccessfully, to obtain from Persia a cession of the islands of Kishm, Henjam and Kharag, 8. In 1804, on the death of Saiyid Sultan of Muscat the Persian port of Bunder Abbas and its dependencies which he held on lease from Persia were seized by the Bani Ma 1 in. In June 1805 a joint Muscati-British expedition which had been organised against the Jowasimi pirates of the Trucial coast before taking action against them recovered by force Bunder Abbas, and/ i ,1804. fn' and its dependencies for the Imam of Muscat, The steps thus taken for Its recovery subsequently evoked a strong protest from the i. 438-9 638. Persian Government as an act of hostility against themselves. Later in July of the same year the allies blockaded a considerable Jowasimi flotilla in the anchorage of Zishm, 9, In 1806 the Ruler of Muscat kidnapped the head of the Bani Ma 1 in, whom he carried off to Muscat and detained until Kishmand Ormuz should be i, 439 delivered up as a ransom for his release, but the Sheikh of Has al Khaimah, by throwing a force into the town of Kishm, made it impossible for the Bani Ma T in to comply with these terms, 184 10. In 1809 the Jowasimi were driven out of Lingah 643 i, 647 and Charak by the Persians and were compelled to 1930 retire to Basidu, while in the same year the Jowasimi stronghold of Luft in Kishm was captured by the British and handed over intact to an agent of the Ruler of Muscat. 11. The sequence of events in Kishm, and at Basidu between 1809 and 1818 is by no means clear, but in the latter year the Jowasimi pirates are reported to have entertained the idea of forming a settlement at Basidu to which they could retire if attacked by the i, 558 Egyptian invaders of the Gulf area. The execution of this scheme is believed to have been frustrated largely by the defeat in December 1818 of a Jowasimi squadron by the Company's ship 'Antelope' , 12, In 1819 Gulf policy was under discussion 559 at Bombay, The Government of Bombay appear to have/ i. 6575. have inclined to a soheme under which the Ruler of Oman should be placed in charge for the future of the Pirate or Trucial coast and the islands of Bahrein, and should in return authorise the formation of a British settlement on the island of Kishm and even defray the cost of maintaining it, 13, It may be noted that the Chief Secretary, Bombay, an expert official who had made a special study of Persian Gulf subjects, vrtiile agreeing as to the establishment of a British station at Kishm 'to this end would have negotiated with the Government of Persian rather than that of Oman', He was overruled by the local Government, but Mr, Lorimer remarks: 'It cannot be doubted that he stood on firm ground when he insisted that his (the Imam of Muscat's) ...claim to sovereign rights over Zishm as against Persia, was probably illfounded, TT 14./f u Government of India, Persian Gulf ( 1801-1853) Precis § 235 Lorimer i. 1936. Preci s § 206 14, The Government of Bombay on 28th October 1819, indicated to Major General sir William Grant Keir that they were of opinion that the 'occupation 'by the British Government of a central and commanding station in the Persian Gulf was indispensable in connection with the permanent suppression of piracy, nor is the Governor in Council aware of a more eligible station than the island of Kishma for that purpose 'It is understood that the Island of Kishma, as well as Angar which is contiguous to it, belongs in full sovereignty to the imam of Ma skat and should the reports that may be received from you and the other persons to whom the consideration of this important subject has been confided be favourable to the measure now suggested, the necessary negotiation will be opened for obtaining possession of the spot that may be fixed upon for forming the establishment'. 15. In a despatch of 15th December 1819 to the Government of India, the Government of Bombay remarked with reference to the same point '10.....We anticipate, however, some opposition on the part of the Persian Government to that measure /forming of a British establishment in the Persian Gulf/, since it would be difficult we apprehend to satisfy that power that our views were limited to the professed object of our policy, the more especially as the Persian Goverrment has manifested some degree of alarm at our contemplating the occupation of the island of Bahrein, 11,With a view to allaying these alarms and of enabling the British Envoy at Tehran to afford to the Persian Government an explicit and candid exposition of the objects to which the expedition is exclusively directed^ directed and of the ultimate plan which wejc on template for the permanent suppression of piracy, our president has addressed a letter to Mr.Willock, (Charge d'Afiaires at Tehran) of which the enclosed is a copy, which we trust will produce the effect of conciliating the Government of Persia to the arrangements which we have submitted to your consideration or to any other which Your Lordship may 'be pleased to prescribe, and in particular to our permanent occupation of Kishma'. precis 16. The despatch of 15th December 1619 to the unarge S 20 7 d'Affaires at Tehran, to which reference is made in the i.1937. preceding paragraph, after explaining in some detail the considerations weighing with the Local Government, added •• 8, The Imam of Muscat having asserted a positive claim to the sovereignty of the island of Kishma, this Government has not hesitated in fixing upon that station as a rendez-vous for the expedition. . The occupation the British Government of a more commanding station in the Gulf being considered to be indispensable to enaole us to exercise a more immediate and efficient control over it than can be done either from Bushire or Massora, the possession of that island would be an important object either permanently in full sovereignty, or temporarily until the beneficial effects which the presence of a British force in the vicinity of the piratical ports may be expected to produce, in reforming their habits, may enaole us to relinquish the possession. The latter expedient should in my opinion be preferred only on a failure of obtaining the cession of Kishma in perpetuity. 9. I entertain no doubt that the cession of Kishiia might be obtained from the imam of Muscat provided his Highness*s pretensions to it be indisputable, but I beiieve that the sovereignty of the island was at one time claimea/♦8. claimed by Persia, and under any circumstances I am satisfied that the Supreme Government would not unless on extreme emergency be inclined to taKe any measure regarding the occupation of that island, which you might conceive to be permanently injurious to our general interests at the Court of Tehran, 10• ^ou must be the best Judge whether we are required either by justice or policy to negotiate the previous consent of Persia, or whether we may content ourselves with the simple explanation of our views and intentions; in either case after the aoove exposition of the motives which impel us to depart from the principles which governed our interposition in the expedition of 1810, and which its entire failure in eradicating piracy has imposed upon us. 1 must leave to your experience, judgment and address to adopt the line of conduct which may most effectually reconcile the important object of eradicating piracy, with the maintenance of the good understanding that so happily exists between His Majesty's Government and the Court of Persia.' Precis 17, A copy of this despatch was also sent to Sir §207 A. W.G, Keir, with the remark that fl 4 By the 8th paragraph you will perceive the nature of the relations which it appears to the Governor in Council to be expedient that we should form with the Imam cf Muscat^ The 9th and 11th paragraphs relate to the interests of Persia, and you will be guided in the prosecution of your operations or your negotiations with the ports and islands which may be disposed to acknowledge its allegiance by the communications you may receive from the 3nvoy at Tehran......,,,,,, v^ is the intention of the Governor in Council to reduce the fu:. ce under your cominand.,. .at as early a peiiod as practicable. , • leaving, as you are authorised to do, one battalion of native infantry and a detail oi artillery should you judge it necessary at Kishma or any other eligible island with the view of overawing the Arab tribes'.0 10- 18. Sir W.G. Keir»s reply to the Government of Bombay* b Despatch of 28th October 1819 referred to in paragraph 14 above does not appear to have discussed the question of the status of Kishm, but he repeated (para,17) in strong terms an earlier recommendation that the eventual Precis removal of the British detachment 'should be to the Island S.235A of Kishm, All that I have l&amp;arned since offering that recommendation has tended to confirui my opinion of that Island being the most favourable situation in every respect, and if no other circumstances existed than those of political expediency, I should be disposed to urge that the removal should take place immediately', (Despatch dated 1st April 1820)t 19. In the light of the Despatch referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Governor of Bombay instructed Captain Thompson, the Commander of the garrison at Ras-al- Khaima, that its removal to the island of Kishm, to the occupation of which the consent of the Imam of Muscat was to be obtained, if not already conceded, had now been Precis approved. (Bombay letter dated 17th April 1820) . Y/ith S .236 this letter was enclosed a letter to the Imam from the Governor, the text of which is not available. 20. On 15th May 1820, Captain Thompson reported that he had despatched the 'Mercury' with the Governor^ letter to the Imam, and also his own letter to His Highness for the purpose of obtaining his consent to the occupation of the island of Kishm,. In a letter of 29th May, Captain Thompson reported that the 'Mercury' had returned Precis on that date from Muscat, bearing the full consent of the S .237 Imam to the removal of the troops to Kishm, and an open letter to the Sheikh of that Island directing him to afford//1 r &amp; 11. afford every assistance to the enbarkation arid conveyance of the troops. 21. The material portions of the Imam's letter to the Governor of Bombay are as follows; 'With regard to the ooservations made by you, connected with the removal of the troops from Ras-al-Khaima to Kishm, God knows that the Precis Island in question, and all other territories, appertaining S. 238 to me and subject to my authority, appertain also to the Honourable Company, and that I do not reckon these dominions as appertaining to me, but as appertaining to the Honourable Company'. 21 . The Imam's letter is, as will be noted, in very general terms, and couched in hyperbolical language not unusual in Oriental communications; and which would, indeed on a strict interpretation, cover not only Kishm, but Muscat itself. On the other hand the letter was with specific reference to a request (the terms of which are not on record) for the removal to Kishm of the British detachment stationed in the Gulf. 22. The Persian Government on a communication being made to them in accordance with the instructions referred to in paragraph 16 above, made it clear that they by no means welcomed the idea of a British occupation of Kishm or any other Island in the Gulf. The Shah refused a personal Lor.i.1936 interview to the Chargd d'Affaires and communicated his Precis instructions on the point through his Ministers. These were S.241. to the effect (Tehran Despatch of 10th May 1820), that when the proposal had oeen previously made (in 1800-1) for the cession of an Island in the Persian Gulf, the Shah had not been prepared to entertain it; that His Imperial Majesty considered that a proposal of such importance as the present was one which ought to originate either from His Britannic Majesty, from the PJast India Company, or f rom the Governor-12. General of India; that according to the Persian Ambassador at London, the Prince Regent intended to send an Ambassador to Teheran, and that it would be preferable that a discussion should be deferred until the Amoassaaor's arrival. 'Kis Majesty was surprised that the Imam of Muscat should claim the sovereignty of the Island of Kishm. It was contended that the Imam held the government of Gambrun, Precis S.242. (bunder Abbas), and of its dependencies, of which Kishm was one, under the supreme authority of the Sovereign of Persia, and the records of the Empire would establish this fact,' 23. In their despatch of 3rd October, 1820, No.1485, to Sir Henry V/illock, at Teheran, the i^omoay Government, after notifying the transfer of the British detachment from Ras-al-Khaima to Kishm, remarked '3. I have already had the honour of informing you that any claims which Persia might possess to the Lor.i. sovereignty of the Island of Kishm would receive the most 1938. candid consideration from the Government, but I do not consider it politic on our part to renew the discussion. Should any proofs of its claim be produced by the Government of Tehran, I would suggest your referring them to this Government, and should hope that dariiag the period that must be occupied by the requisite investigation, the King of Persia will have leisure to observe the good effects arising from our occupation of* this land;and be induced to consent to our retaining it, even if he should estaolish his right to demand its evacuation'. 24. On the 20th December, 1820, Sir Henry V/illock reported to the Government of India that consequent oil strong representations from the Prince-Governor of Pars as to the dangers of the occupation ®f apart of Kishm by the British detachment the Persian Government had demanded.13 25./ demanded, in a strongly rorded Note dated 9th December 1820, of which the following is an extract, the immediate departure of the British detachment from that Island:- '...His Majesty's Charg6 a'Affaires likewise stated Precis that after punishment of the Joasmis it would 'be necessary 3.249 still to keep some British troops in the ersian Gulf to prevent a recurrence of piracy, and that the Imam of Muscat (*ho on that part of Persia is the Governor of Bunder Abbas and its dependencies) was willing to allow of a British settlement on the Island of Kishm or Henjam; to this was answered that first Muscat is a dependency of Persea, and as the Imam has not the power of permitting the residence of British troops at Muscat, much less car he grant a permission at Kishm and Henjam, which are dependencies of Bunder Abbas At this time we have heard that a British force has landed at Kishm The state of affairs does not require the presence of British troops We do not know on what account the troops from India have settled in the Persian Gulf. In short orders will be issued by His Majesty to His Hoj'-al Highness the Prince of Pars, to send a person to the troop? on Kishm desiring them immediately to leave it, and we now request His Majesty's Charg6 d'Affaires to direct the Officer Commanding at Kishm to return to India with his troops, and to write to the Honourable Governor of Bombay, or to whomever it may be necessary, with a view to avoiding such acts, which are contrary to the spirit of the Treaty between our two States'.14, 25. The Governor of Bombay Sir Mountstuart Elphinstone noted on this correspondence as follows: Precis 'The King of Persia's claim to Kishm does not appear § 250-56 to be strengthened by his present arguments, but on the contrary to be weakened by His Majesty's making it in part depend on his sovereignty over Muscat, a pretension which seems to be entirely untenable. The King of Persia's alarm at our occupation of Kishm appears however, to be serious and unfeigned, and on this ground the Honourable the Governor would be disposed to give up the measure if it were not one of urgent necessity. It is believed also that the British Government has in some measure countenanced the claim of the King of Persia to Kishm by requesting from His Majesty in the year 1799, the cession of that Island. The application seems not (? but) to have originiated in an erroneous notion of His Majesty's rights, but it ought to make this Government more delicate in its conducat at present. ' 26. Apparently at the beginning of 1821 a Vakil of the Prince Governor of Shiraz visited Kishm, Lor.i.1939 consequent on unfounded allegations that the British were building forts there, to prohibit their construction. He satisfied himself that there was no foundation for the report, and undertook to assure his master that the British detachment had evidently no other duty than that of checking piracy. In/15. ^ 27. In May 1821 Dr. -Jidrew Jukes was deputed to the Persian ; julf by the G -ovemment of Bombay with a view to allaying the suspicions of the Persian G-ovemnient in regard to the retention of the British force or the island of Kishm. The following extracts from his instructions bear on the question Lor: i.1940 of the title to the Island. Precis S.272 1T i, Y ju are already informed of the doubts which are being entertained in regard to the sovereignty over the Island of Kishm to which the Governments of Persia end Muscat assert pretensions. The former having recently betrayed the strongest apprehensions at our occupation of it, and nreferred a formal demand for the removal of the detachment, as you wi11 perceive from the accompanying despatch dated 20th December from His Majesty's Charge d'affaires at Teheran the Hon T ble the Governor in Council determined to despatch you on a mission to the Persian Gulf with the view of allaying these unfounded claims or of adopting such measures as the exigencies of the case may render expedient.... 3, Lqually solicitous has the Governor in Council been to ascertain the justness of the claim which the Imam of Muscat advanced to the Sovereignty of x (ishm,' the result of Captain Sauieir 7 ^ enquiries leading the Governor to believe those claims to be well founded. The detachment was transferred from Eaoool Khima to that island with the sanction of the/the Imam. This document will enable you to draw from the Government of Persia a statement of the grounds on which her pretensions to Kishm may 'be founded, ana wnich may he as untenable as her claim to tribute from Muscat which the Imam has refused to pay ana Persia has been unable to exact since the death of 3hah jibbas.... 7. .should it appear impossible to avoid hostilities by other means...you are empowered to propose to the prince that the detachment should be withdrawn from Kishm to Muscat... pending the negotiation regarding the ultimate fate of it. You will explain that this concession originates in the reluctance of this Government to disturb the friendship subsisting between the British and Persian nations, especially on a point which has not been decided by the Governor General in Council that the removal of the troops is not 10 be interpreted into a recognition of the King of Persia's title to Kishm nor to act as a restraint on our reoccupying the position, if the decision of the supreme Government, or any other cause, should render such a course expedient. (Bombay Government letter to Dr. Jukes, No.98 of 16th May 1821). 28. On 14th August 1821, Dr. Jukes submitted to the Government of Bombay the following Note on the origin of the Muscat title to Kishm, Or muz 9 etc., which in view of its importance is reproduced in full.17. 29' Report, dated 14th Au^ast 1821, of Dr.Jukes , Political Agen t , Kislim, as to the origin of the connection of the Imams of Maskat with Kishm, Qrmuz, Bunder Abbas, and other parts of the Persian Coast near that place . - 'The Persian Ministers having expressed their dissatisfaction at the small detachment of British troops 'being stationed on the Island of Kishm, and considering that it was likely to 'become a subject oi future discussion between myself and the Persian Government, I have lost no opportunity of ootaining every information I could collect frcm the best authorities, as to the sovereignty of the island, ooth at Maskat and Kishm, and although the information I have obtained is not so complete and satisfactory as I could wish, I beg leave respectfully to submit it to the consideration of the Honourable the Governor in C ouncil. 2. The Bini Maainee tribe originally resided at Koong on the Persian Coast, and it is now about 70 or 80 years since Shaik Abdulla Maainee took tne Island of Kishm from Mulla Aly Shah, who was then Chief of the Island, on behalf of the Persian Government: and Shaikh Abdulla afterwards farmed Bunder Abassee and its dependencies fran Nadir Shah. 3. The Bini Maainee tribe remained in possession of the island for many years, and after ITadir Shah s death, continued to pay tribute to the present reigning family of Persia, for Bunder Abassee and its dependencies/18. dependencies which they still retained. 4. About 26 or 27 years ago the inhabitants of Kislm, being dissatisfied v /ith the tyrannical system adopted towards them by Mulla Hussan Maainee, their Chief and Governor, solicited His Highness Syed Sultan, the Imara of Maskat, to take the Islands under his government and control; the Imam proceeded accordingly v/ith an army, and by force of arms took possession of the Islands of Kishm, Bunder Abassee and Grmuz, from lv r ulla Hussein, and it has ever since remained under the general control of the Imam of llaskat. 5. Syed Sultan, notwithstanding he had taken these places by force of arms fror. Mulla Hussein Maainee, continued to farm Bunder Abassee, and its dependencies from the Persian Government, as the Bini Maainee tribe had done before him, and his son Syed Saeed , the present Imam of Maskat, continues to do the same; he pays four thousand Tomans annually for the town and dependencies of Bunder Abassee, including Meena Humeel and Khumeer. Syfe bin Mubhaun, an Arab Chieftain, is at present Governor of Bunder Abassee on the part of His Highness the Iman, and his younger brother is the Governor of Crmuz. Sheikh Abdul Rahman 1'aainee, the Governor of Kishm, is related to His Highness by marriage, so that the Government of all the principal places farmed by the Imam of Maskat is entirely in the hands of the Arabs at present, and I do not know whether the Persian Government would venture to risk the attempt of taking these places forcibly from them, under any circumstances, but as the Imam has several ships, and could command the s ources/(9 19. sources (? services) of a great number of buggalas and boats belonging to the different Arab tribes in the Gulf, it is almost certain, I think, that the Imam would be able to retain the Islands of Kishm, Ormuz and Laraic, in spite of every exertion of the .Persian Government. 6. The whole of the Persian shore of the Gulf is in the possession of different Arab trioes, and tnough they may have little differences and quarrels among themselves, they would cordially unite to repel any attach the Persians might make to accept or subdue any one of them. 7. It is quite impossible tha.t the Arao tribes and the Persians can ever cordially blend their interests and act in concert together. The habits of the people are very different, the independence of an Arao Snai-ch submits reluctantly to the Persian yoke, and the difference of religious feeling effectually prevents anything like a cordial co -operation between t.iem. 8. I regret extremely that neither at Maskat nor at Kishm, have I been able to obtain a sight of one oi the old Persian Furrnauns by which His Highness the linain farms Bunder Abassee from the sovereign ol Persia, ^.n order to ascertain what places are particularly speciiieci, as constituting its dependencies. I think it unlikely that such an important document as the grant , or Fumaun of the King of Persia, by which His Highness the Imam, farms so large a portion of territory and for which he pays 4,000 Tomauns annually should not be in existence; it/20. it is possible it might have 'been mislaid at the time I was at Maskat or it might have been intentionally withheld, but I was expressly informed by Syed Abdul Kahir, His Highness's confidential Secretary, that neither Kishm, Ormuz, nor Larak are specified on the receipts annually granted by the Persian Government for the stipulated sum paid to them; and in reply to a series of questions which I wrote out to be answered at Maskat, and which I know were carried by Syed Abdul Kahir to His Highness the Imam himself, it was expressly declared that the Islands of Kishm, Crmuz and Larak, belonged exclusively/ to the Imam. 9. It appears to me extreme presumption in the Persian Government to declare that even Kaskat itself is a dependency of Persia, and the information I have obtained satisfies me that Maskat never was tributary to that S*i:ate; perhaps the pretensions of Persia may be grounded on the following circumstances which I obtained in detail from what must be considered the highest authority, the Imam itself. v* 10. About 78 years ago. Sultan bin Syfe Gaarubi was Imam of Maskat and the Province of Qmaun; he made himself very unpopular by his tyranny, and was removed from the Government by the general voice of the people; he went and sought the aid of Nadir Shah, then sovereign of Persia, to reinstate him in his Government; ITadir Shah complied with his request, and sent an army back with him to restore him to influence and to power. This army landed at Ras-sul-Khima, and after much hard fighting they succeeded in marching through the country as far as Maskat13./ 21. which place alone seems then to have 'been retained by the adherents of Sultan bin Syfe, while all the Province of Qnaun remained unsubdued. The independent Arabs now advanced and surrounded Maskat, and the Persian Army was reduced to considerable difficulties. About this time intelligence of the death of Nadir Shah reached them, the Persians made certain proposals to the Arabs, which were finally agreed to, and the Persian Army returned back to Bundar Abassee without effecting the ooject of their caning. 11. In this state of affairs Ahmed bin Saed, the grandfather of the present Imam of Llaskat , and then a Chieftain Canmanding at Sohar, assumed the aovernment of Cmaun and was proclaimed Imam. 12. The claims of Persia therefore to the Islands of Kishm, Ormuz, etc., seem to rest entirely upon their being considered as dependencies of Bunder Abassee. This point I have not yet been able to ascertain, but it is quite evident that the Imam is not disposed to acknowledge the right of Persia to the islands in question, and it is, I believe, the universal law of nations to claim as a right, that which they have obtained by the sword. Persia with equal presumption claims the Island of Bahrein because it was once tributary t o it, though it has thrown off the yoke, and paid no tribute for these 30 years. Persia may with equal justice lay claim to Delhi at the present day because ITadir Shah once conquered and plundered it.&amp; 22. 13. In my discussions therefore with the Persian Ministers, I think I shall be able, in point of right, to support all the measures the British Government have adopted in occupying the Island of Kishm, when I consider, however, the very heavy expense of supporting the establishment, the impossibility of employing the troops on any active service in the Gulf, for four months in the year on account of the excessive heats, the sickness that has prevailed there ever since the hot weather commenced, and the inefficiency of the force arising frcm that cause alone, I confess, I feel more doubts than I have heretofore done, as to the expediency and utility of the measure; but as I am aware that different sentiments have been and probably still are, entertained by those who are far more competent to decide than I am, I beg to offer such a hint with extreme diffidence and with the most perfect conviction of the fallibility of my own judgment.' 30. Dr.Jukes's report, while of great value, is as will be observed, by no means conclusive. Mr.Lorimer comments that 'as his investigations were conducted chiefly under the auspices of Qnani officials, whose statements he would naturally be inclined to accept, his report, dated 14th August, 1821, can hardly be regarded as other than an ex parte document, but as such it is of interest. 31. Dr.Jukes subsequently proceeded to Shiraz, in a letter dated 25th October 1821 frcm which'he refers to the Prince Governor, in the course of discussion as having made sane observations regarding the Island of Kishm being one of the dependencies of Pars, and that/that the Imam was only a sulDject of his. The Prince however added that he had personally no objection to the British detachment remaining in Kishm, since in view of Dr. Juices ! s explanations it appeared to have the peace and tranquillity of the Gulf for its only motive, and that he would so inform the Shah. 32. The Persian Government however maintained their opposition to the maintenance of a British detachment in Kishm, and the Government of Bombay accordingly referred the general question to the Government of India, in a despatch of 9th March 1822, Ko.469. In the matter of the title of Uuscat to Kishm they remarked that while Kishm seemed much the most satisfactory station from the point of view of suppressing piracy, however desirable it might be to retain the island we could not overlook considerations of justice and policy towards Persia: the King of Persia had not yet shown any proof of his title whatever to Kishm, except its alleged authority (sic) on which ground he had also claimed Muscat and the whole province of Cm an. Even the arguments mentioned by His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires do not establish the claims of Persia. Sir John Malcolm on his first mission solicited a grant of Kishm fron Persia, which was refused. If it had since appeared that Persia had no title to the territory so solicited what should prevent our applying to the right owner ? Still less did a casual expression of one of the Imam's officers destroy his master's right, if he ever had one. The/24. The Governor of Bom'bay in Council was not acquainted with the nature of the Imam's rights either to Bunder Abhas or Kishm, 'but supposing them equal there seemed abundant reason why he should waive his claim to Bunder Abbas, an integral part of Persia, and within ra^ch of Agha Mahomed Khan ! s army; and retain it to Kishm, which was probably beyond the reach cf that monarch's power, A claim, however, to which His Majesty's Minister at Teheran attached importance ought not to be hastily set aside, and supposing the King of Persia to possess any reasonable ground of pretension to the island, it would be unfriendly, at the least, to oppose it by military occupation. It seemed incumbent on us to avoid giving the Shah this ground of disquiet, if we could do so without a very serious sacrifice of our own interests ... It remained to be considered how far our v/ithdrawing would affect the Imam to whose interests his zeal and fidelity to the alliance required that we should pay every attention. Precis 33, The Government of Bombay's opinion was therefore S279 a that we should ultimately retire from Kishm; if we were to retire we should, however, they thcught, take advantage of the time alltwed by the King of Persia's own proposal, and in the interim apprise the Imam of the probability of our withdrawing from the Persian Gulf. 34. To Persia viq might say that the time the Shah had allowed for a reference to England would probably be sufficient for the purpose as our occupation was only to be temporary; and that at all events the decision of H.M.G. would of course be binding on the authorities in India; Lor«i. 1943, but in this and in all other communications the utmost care should/25. should be taken to avoid pronouncing an opinion on any claim which the Imam of Muscat might possess to Kishm. 35, These views were approved 'by the Government of India, but owing to a sudden change of atmosphere at Tehran, which led the Charge d'Affaires to ask for Lor,i. his passports, action was not taken on them; and rumours 1944. that the Shah had demanded a substantial Increase in the rent payable by Muscat for Bunder Abbas and its dependencies (including Kishm) led to steps being taken to reinfoirce the garrison of Basidu - steps countermanded in June 1822 on the restoration of good relations with the Shah, but too late to prevent the Charge d'Affaires from acting on instructions to notify them to the Persian Government, 36, On 1st September 1822 Sir H. Willock accordingly informed the Persian Government that it had been found necessary to augment the detachment on the island of Kishm as a temporary and precautionary measure Precis S,284. and received a reply in general terms. 36A, T .7hile in the circumstances described above, Basidu was evacuated by British troops in February 1822, it proved impossible to secure an equally convenient naval station in the Gulf. Basidu was accordingly P.G.13 p.118. reoccupied by H.M.G. in 1823, from which year until 1878 it remained the headquarters of the British Naval Squadron in the Persian Gulf. No protest against its reoccupation appears at the time to have been made by Persia. 37, On 3rd September 1822 Captain Bruce, the Resident/Resiaent at Bushire, reported to the Governor ot Bombay the unauthorised agreement which he had concluded in the preceding month with the Prince of Lor.i.1946-8 Shiraz, in regard to Bahrein and Gulf questions. The agreement which inter alia embodied an arrangement in regard to the island of Kishm, on the basis of Persian sovereignty, was at once formally disowned by the Government of Bombay, while the Persian Government on their side subsequently instructed the Prince of shiraz tnat ne had exceeded his powers in entering into discussion with the Resident. The Government of Bombay in a letter of 1st November 1822 to the resident, No.1491, intimated to Captain Bruce that he had acted without authority and was removed from his appointment as a punishment. In informing him of tne disavowal of the treaty which he had concluded with the Prince of Shiraz and criticising its terms, they reimrked;- 'It admits the claim of the King of Persia to Kishm contrary to all history, to the protections (? protestations) of His Highness the Imam of Iviuscat and to the repeated declarations of this Government. It thereby admits the occupation of that island without the King of Persia's consent to have been on unjust aggression, and it agrees to admit a Persian force into Kishm, and to make over to the Persians the island which we received from the Imam' 38. The Governor of Bombay simultaneously addressed Precis 3.289 a letter to the Prince Regent of Pars in which after Lor.i.1948. repudiating the treaty he remarked;- 'With/27. 'With regard to Kismn I had long since applied to the iviost Noble the Governor General lor his consent for the withdrawal of the letachment and having now oDta~nea. it, the troop-j have teen ordered to return, md trie island to he made over to the raaiL of kuscat.. from whom it was received by the British Government; hut Jn aoing so this Government is acuiated oy considerations of its own convenience; .and with respect to the claims of the Government of Persia on that island they have not as yet been provea.' 1 39. The instructionG issued by the Government of Bombay in their letter of i2th November 18^^, No. 1584, to Captain Bruce*s successor as Resident at Bushire, remarked:- '4. The effect of Captain Bruce's proceedings is calculated to impress the Imam of Muscat and the rSialln of Bahrein with an apprehension that, instead of observing a perfect neutrality in the Gulf, and limiting our interference to a control of all measures likely to lead to a renewal of piracy, founded on Ivkjor General Sir William Keir's treaties, we have thrown our v ^iole influence in the scale in favour of Persia in support of its general views of supremacy over every islanci arid possession in the Gulf of Persia. The enclosed letters from the Honble. the Governor to the ^man of muscat and the Shaikh of Bahrein arc intended to remove any aoubts or apprehensions which the conduct of Guptain Bruce may have excited in that respect . . .

Period 18^3 to 1928 . 40• Between 1823 and 1826 the Persians endeavoured but without success to dispos.ess the Iniaiu of Iviuscat of his revenue lease of Bunaer Ahbas and its dependencies. Between 1846 and 1848 a second attempt of the same nature was avoided hy gifts of the Imam of Muscat to the Persian negotiators. In 1852-4 in the absence of the Imam of Muscat in Zanzibar the luiscati Governor of Bundar Abhas v/as expeil^d by Persia but the lost districts were subsequently forcibly recovered by the Imam. The Imaxn was, however, unable to hold thern, and an agreement was finally reached between Persia and kuscat in 1855 under which a fresh lease for twenty years was ^ranted to the latter whJch involved not only the payment of an increased rent to Persia by the ruler of Iviuscat but the specific recognition as Persian territory of the Islam of Kishm. 41. The Persian firman of 1855 specifies in its preamble that the islands of Kishm, Qrmuz, e tc. are Persian territories leased on certain terms to tne Imam of kuscat. The firman contains no specific reference to Basidu. Article 13 runs as follows:- ' as long as Bunder Abbati, the above named two islands, Shemal, ivlnab, and their dependencies, are in the hands of the Imam of Muscat, he should not allow any officers of foreign Governments to go there. He should also promise to protect these places by land and sea, providing for every port having an anchorage some ships ... He should further promise to protect the boundaries or any of the above-named places, from all interference or intrusion/w 30. intrusion of strangers whether in an amicable or hostile manner. He should not at any time allow any ship .... or any hostile person, armed or otherwise, Arab or foreign, to approach or get a looting in Bunaer Abbas or the Persian territory, with hcaile intentions or other pretexts,' Ai-ticlfc 14 proceeds that:- 'The Imam of Muscat, no owithstanding these conditions has not the right of letting Bunder Aobas and the ahove-saia places to any foreigner . . . .' 42. Article 2 of th« Treaty of Paris, of 4th March 1857, on the conclusion of the Anglo- Persian war, provided that 'the forces of Her Majesty the Queen shall evacuate the Persian territory, subject to conditions and stipulations thereafter specified. 1 ' Article 14 of the same Treaty provided that Aitchison 'as soon as the stipulations in regard to the XII P.81 No.XVIII. evacuation by the Persian troops of Herat and the Ai'ghan territories, as well as in regard to the reception of the British Mission at Teheran, shall have been carried into full el feet, the British troops shall, without delay, be withdrawn from all ports, places, and islands, belonging to Persia'. Despite this, not only did the Naval station at Basidu remain in British occupation: but no evidence has been traced of any complaint on this score by Persia, nor does any request ior its evacuation appear 4 to have been made. 42A./31. Letter from Sir L. Pelly dated. 82. Oct.1864. x The refer ence is to the letter quoted in para. 21 above. Precis S.145. 42A. In 1864 the Resident in the Persian Gulf emphasised that Persia hcid. 'tacitly acknowledged our right to possession, 'because when at the conclusion oi the war 'between uscao and Persia in 1856 the Treaty (under which the present lease obtains) was entereu into, Persia raised no objection to the presence of our flag or to undisguised maintenance of a considerable station, coal depots, hospital, etc. at Bassidox-e'. 43. The telegraph agreement of 1864 between Muscat and Great Britain, which has never been secret, contains the following Article:- 'Article 6. In like manner nothing in these Articles shall be held as invalidating or derogating from the title of the British Government to the Station of Bassadore, that station having been freely granted x to the British Government by my late illustrious father of blessed memory, the late Imaum Syed Saeed bin Sultan, on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors'. This Article had been d eliberately inserted at the tine by the Political Resident, who remarked:- 'Government will ooserve that Article 6 relates to our station at Bassidore. Our title to that station has of course been for many years a bona fide one, but on telegraphic and general considerations the present seemed a convenient opportunity for giving to our title the sanction of a written confirmatory deed'. 44. In 1866 the lease of 1855-6, which was for twenty years only, and was limited to Sultan Said and his son, automatically came to an end. The Persians accordingly transferred the lease to a member of the A1 bu Said family, but as a dependent of Persia and not as representing the Sultans of Oman. The lessee having withheld the revenue due from him, steps were taken by Persia in 1868 for his forcible/32. forcible removal. This lea to a demand 'by the Sultan of Muscat, backed 'by a threat or force, for the transfer to him of the lease. As the result of British mediation Lor.i.480. (H.M.Gf. refusing to allow the Sultan to blockade S.Persian ports) the lease was accordingly renewed for a period of 48 years in ravour of Sultan Salim and his descendants'. In the course of the discussions the Sultan claimea Henjam and Larak as dependencies of Oman irrespective of the Bunder Abbas lease, nor was his claim to the islands either abandoned or disproved'. The re-lease in question, dated 4th August 1868, rollows the Firman of 1855 in making no reference to Basidu, out contains provisions in its 13th and 14th articles substantially identical with those quoted in para.41 above from that Firman. Article 13 emphasises that no foreign ships shall under any circumstances be permitted 'to anchor within the limits of the anchorage ground of the said territories'. Lor.i.S14V. 45. On the deposition of Sultan Salim at the end of 1868 the leaae granted by rersia in September of that year was automatically determined, and was never thereafter renewed in favour of Muscat. 46. The surrender of fugitives who had taken refuge in the Basidu concession appears to have been Lor.i.2106. demanded by rersia on various occasions between 1863 and 1868, but never granted. Government regarding it 'as virtually British territory', and no extradition agreement existing with Persia. In September 1868 the Government of India on an examination of the legal position of the settlement which had been raised by a demand lor the surrender of a slave who had taken refuge in the concession, informed/33. informed the Goveinment of Bombay that in their opinion ''the station in question cannot pi operly 'be considered as ^ritish territory. It is perfectly true that we have occupied Bassidore either as a naval or coaling station for nearly half a century. But the island has always been treated by us as a dependency of Bunder Abbas, and Bunder Abbas and its dependencies, including this island of Kishm, and consequently Bassidore, have been leased to the Sultan of Muscat by the Shah of Persia in circumstances with which Government of Bombay is perfectly familiar ... As the British Government holds possession of the town oi Bassidore by permission of the Sultan of Iluscat, while that potentate derives his lease of Kishm, which includes Bassidore, from the Shah of fersia, it follows necessarily that Kishm must still be considered as Persian territory* There may be some obscurity as to the exact nature of our derivative title to the town of Bassiaore, and it .iay have been thought that our rights over the town existed by continued usage or that we had obtained a prescriptive title; but in looking closely into the question it becomes evident that our rights aie subordinate to those of Muscat, which again admittedly, are entirely subordinate to those of rersia, and always have been so treated up to this very houi'. 46.A. The opinion expressed by the Government of India in 1868 has since hela the field and was maintained by them in 1875. In 1901 the Political x.esident was instructed by G/l to ?ol. the Government of India that no official of the Persian Res.9th July 1901. Government can be permitted to reside in any part of the station at Basidu without the express sanction of the British Government.' 47, In 1905 the coal agent at Basidu was instructed by the/Ip. 34. P.G.13 the Resident, Sir Percy Cox, to warn a Persian customs p•119• officer who had interfered, that 'he has no business in British t erritory, and if he persists he should not he allowed to come within British territory'. 48. In November 1926, the Foreign Office remarked P.O. to in a letter to the India Office that in view of the effect 1.0. 6th I\iov.l926, on the status of Hen jam of admitting the Persian claim to P.5847/26. Basidu 'it would be dangerous to allow doubt to be cast on the validity of the British rights to Basidu whi*h rest on undisturbed occupation over a long period'. 49. in 1928, consequent on a suggestion that the Persian Government were likely to make an armed descent on Easidu, the Charge d'Affaires at Teheran was instructed to make representations to the central Customs authorities and if necessary to warn.the Persian Government that any molestation of British Basidu 'which has been a British station for 100 years, would be a complete negation of x Minister of Courts promise to Sir R.Clive'.
