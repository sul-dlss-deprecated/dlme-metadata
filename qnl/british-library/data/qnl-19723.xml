Following telegram has been sent by Commander—in~ Chief to the Admiralty in consultation with me. Begins - Ihe Political Resident and I have carefully gone into the cause of the fighting at Dibai, and we are of opinion that it was the culmination of a growing feeling of hostility to the measures enforced for the suppression of the arms traffic on this coast. The immediate cause was resentment at the attempted search of two houses. On previous recent occasion on which Sheikh had been asked to have a house searched, he did so in such a perfunctory was as to make operation a farce. On present occasion though called upon by Commander of landing party to meet him and search certain houses with support of our men, he failed to comply and did not appear until trouble had begun. The impression conveyed by several reports of British officers is that he allowed trouble to commence either by apathy or intention, but that when he saw that it had gone too far he exerted himself to stop it and showed that he was able to control it when he chose. The Sheikh came on board h HYACINTH m at Dibai on * ' • S 28 December under a safe conduct to interview Political Resident and myself. He altogether repudiated complicity in the firing on our men, and alleged that the latter had started the firing. His statements generally were altogether contrary to the•' i to the facts reported by our officers and could not be accepted. He having further refused in spite of explanations to allow a tide pole to be replaced which had boen erected by the officer commanding boat and which the Sheikh had caused to be removed, or to agree to receive a British Officer as Resident's Agent at Dibai, we have accordingly made the following demands on him in writing and have allowed him 48 hours for compliance. (1) Immediate replacement of tide pole and retention as long as needed by officer commanding H.M. Ship stationed here. (2) Acceptance of telegraph installation whenever considered necessary by Government in accordance with provisions of additional article of treaty of 4 May 1853. (3) Delivery of 400 serviceable rifles to be collect ed from inhabitants. (4) Payment of Rs. 50,000 as fine to be considered at disposal of Government and retention or restora tion of whole or any portion to be affected by his acceptance of following two further conditions which however are not part of present ultimatum pending concurrence of Government. (5) Acceptance of British Officer as Agent with small personal guard, and co-operation in finding himself suitable quarters and accord of protection and friendly treatment. (6) Acquiescence in exchange of existing primitive and unsatisfactory postal arrangements for a sub post office of India Postal Department, as at other ports of steamers call in the Gulf. Resident and I are convinced that both political, commercial and arms traffic requirements on trucial coast demand appointment of a British Officer at Dibai. A proper post office is also needed by our traders, and a wireless installation is indispensable if British Officer is dis located there. We recommend that we be authorised to take present opportunity to insist on Sheikh's undertaking to accept these measures. It will be understood that installation of British Officer will mean that a sufficient guard must be provided for his safety, and wireless installed. I have small installation available at once, and would propose to erect it pending replacement by more effective one. Bnds.TELEGRAM From Colonel Cox, Dibai lo Foreign, Calcutta Date 31 December 1910. The following telegram has been sent by the Commander-in-Chief to Admiralty in consultation with me. Begins. With reference to my telegram No.233 of 29 December regarding position at Dibai. Shaikh has complied with 4 demands included in ultimatum, and as regards items 5 and 6 he has been informed that he must fully understand that he will have to accept the decision of Government without question. He is a weak ruler, however, and experience gained by recent incident demonstrates that while not intractable or unfriendly himself, he is coerced by a faction of truculent relatives, who are strongly opposed to any inconvenient increase of British influence or domination. In our opinion it becomes all the more necessary to locate a British Agent here in order to strengthen our hold, not only upon Dibai but upon the coast generally. But under the present conditions it is possible that we may find difficulty in installing the agent without the employment of force, and if that should become necessary it would be advisable to have a force of 1000 men, including artillery and sappers, ready to be sent up if the Shaikh refuses to comply with the demand when it is made. A simple bombardment would have the effect of considerably damaging the town and pearling fleet, and would to a largo extent destroy the value of Dibai as a trading port, but it would not necessarily bring about the7 the submission of the tribesmen unless followed up by the disembarkation of a sufficiently strong force to occupy the town. We are both of decided opinion that execution of measure is urgently called for before the advent of hot weather, and trust that the Government will see fit to authorise it. Ends.44 No. 8 A., dated H. M. S. 'Hyacinth' at Bushire, the 2ad (received 10th) January 1911, From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In amplification of my telegram * despatched to you from H. M. S. - o •, xt j ' Hyacinth ' on 29th and 31st December. • Serial Nos. S3 and 26. f ■ i t u xi_ i. j , . respectively, I have the honour to submit the following report of my proceedings at Debai in concert with His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief. Embarking at Bushire in H. M. S.' Hyacinth ' on 27th December as soon as the weather permitted, we arrived at Debai soon after noon the following day. 2. The details of what occurred before onr arrival are fully recorded in the report submitted to His Excellency by the Flag Captain, which he is forwarding to the Government of India in the Marine Department by this post; and I would refer you to that communication for a narrative of the incident. All I would propose to do now is to forward translations of the communications which passed between myself and the Shaikh, and to add such comment on the situation from a political point of view as seems called for. 3. The Shaikh naturally feared to come off to the Flagship without a written assurance from me that he would be landed again in safety, but having received it came on board at once with the Hesidency Agent, Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif, and his cousin Shaikh Butti-bin-Rashid. As stated by the Admiral and myself in our joint telegramf of 29th (? 30th) ., „ „„ December, the evidence of the several S cfia I No# fY* n ^ i j • i • omcers concerned appeared to us to indi cate that, either from apathy or by intention, the Shaikh had not taken the trouble to prevent the attack by his subjects on the landing party, but that when he saw that it had gone too far, and when specifically called upon by the Flag Captain, he had done his best to stop the fii'ing and showed himself able to do so. In fact it is clear that had it not been for his eventual assistance the losses to oar party would have been much heavier. 4. In his interview with the Commander-in-Chief and myself, though he clearly felt the seriousness of his position, the Shaikh adopted an uncompro mising attitude, alleging that no message from the Captain had ever reached him ; that he had known nothing about the landing of the party until it was on shore ; that he had dressed and come out as soon as he could, but that by the time he had arrived on the scene and found Captain Dick the trouble had already begun; and lastly, that the firing had been started by our men. It is impossible to accept these statements or to argue about them. The Shaikh was informed what the facts were according to the collective testimony of our officers: it was pointed out that his version of the affair was in direct contradiction to their testimony : that, as to how the firing commenced, there was no doubt at all, and that though we were ready to recognise that he eventually endeavoured to stop the firing, we could but hold him, as ruler of the place, responsible for what had occurred and must exact reparation from him. 5. 'We then proceeded to make verbally the demands reported in our telegram J of 29th December. The Shaikh t Senai No. 23, made little difficulty in agreeing to the payment of 50,000 rupees or the surrender of 400 rifles, but declined to accede to the other four items. 6. Dusk having by this time come on and the Shaikh having to return to the shore, he was informed that our demands would now be sent to him in writing and that he would have 48 hours in which to comply. This was done in the terms of the document , of which a translation is enclosed. I may explain that the installation of a telegraph station was included in the ulti matum, in view of the fact that it was incumbent on the Shaikh by treaty to accept it. 7. The location of a British Agent and a post office were approved by the Government of India as measures to be carried out with the Shaikh's con currence, but it did not appear to His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief and♦ 28 myself that we could, without further reference, presume that Goremment would be prepared under present conditions to force these measures on the Shaikh, and they were consequently not included in the terms to which we required the Shaikh to accede within 48 hours. 8. As will be seen by the Shaikh's reply to the ultimatum he complied satisfactorily with our demands, 12 hours before the time expired, but accord ing to information which reached us from time to time from the shore it was for a long time by no means certain that he would do so, owing to the reactionary influence exercised over him by a truculent section of his relatives. Fortunately the Shaikhs of Shargah and Um-el-Kawain were present in Dehai the former having ridden in in connection with the recent incident, and the latter having arrived by chance without knowing of it. They were sent for on board on the 30th, and informed that it was incumbent on them to give Government their help upon this occasion by advising Shaikh Butti in the right direction. While they were both together the Shaikh of Shargah contented himself by endeavouring to get better terms for Shaikh Butti, while the Shaikh of Um-el- Kawain took little part in the conversation. The latter however is under considerable personal obligation to me and to Government, and while I had a private interview with him, the Shaikh of Shargah was shown round H. M.'s Ship and realised from the busy preparations in progress on board that there was no intention on our part to give way. On returning to the shore they joined their pressure to that of the Resi dency Agent, with the result that a letter containing Shaikh Butti's compliance soon came off. 9. He was to have come on board at 9 a.m . the following morning with the money and the rifles ; meanwhile, however, a heavy surf had got up, and a telegram had been received from Bushire showing that the position there was disquieting. It was therefore arranged that the Shaikh should come on board H. M. S. ' Fox' as soon as the sea went down, and His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief and I left for Bushire in H. M. S. 'Hyacinth'. 10. Reverting to the circumstances attending the incident which neces sitated our presence at Debai, it will be evident to the Government of India from a perusal of the naval report that the behaviour of the landing party in an extremely ditfioult position was beyond all praise; but I am of opinion, and in this the Naval Commander-in-Chief fully concurs, that action on shore in t he direction of searching native houses by parties from H. M.'s Ships cannot be undertaken without great risk of awkward incidents, and that it is not worth while taking such risk except for the capture of considerable stores of arms, and after reference to higher authority. It will be seen that His Excellency has issued instructions in this sense for the guidance of II. M.'s Ships. Translation of ultimatum presented to the Shaikh of Dehai hy the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on 29th December 1910. To Shaikh Butti-bin-Soheil, Ruler of Debai. After compliments. —I address you in confirmation of the discussion which took place between you and His Excellency the Admiral and myself on 28th December 1910 on board H. M. S.' Hyacinth', and I now call upon you to render compliance both in action and in writing, with the following demands, within 48 hours, that is to say before 9 o'clock on 31st December=2| hours after sunrise on Saturday. (1) You must replace the pole which indicates the rise and fall of the tide, and which was erected by Lieutenant Noakes, in command of the boat of H. M. S. ' Hyacinth' stationed in the Khor of your town, and after replacing it you must uudertake to keep it there by placing guards on your ,29 behalf or by some other means, as long as the Captain of the man-of-war lying at your port requires its retention. The real object and harmless significance of the erection of the said pole has been fully explained to you verbally. (2) You must intimate to me in writing your complete acquiescence in the location of a telegraph post in your town whenever Government considers necessary, and you must undertake to protect the station and the establish^ ment, as it is incumbent upon you to do according to the provisions of the additional article appended to the treaty which your predecessors entered into with the British Government on 4&lt;th May 1853. A copy of that treaty is in your possession. It is one of the several treaties which you formally took upon yourself at the time of your succession to the Shaikhship, except for which the British Government would not have recognised you as Shaikh of Debai. Then with reference to the fine in connection with the attack by your subjects on the party from the man-of-war on 24th December 1910. (3) You must collect and deliver to me on board H. M.'s Ship, within the time specified above, 400 good rifles. Martinis or something better. (4) You must pay over to me in cash a sum of 50,000 rupees, and the said amount to remain at the disposal of the British Government. The restoration or confiscation of the said amount wholly or partly will be contin gent on your accepting the demands mentioned below. (5) You must agree to the location in your port of a British officer as Agent of the British Residency in the Persian Gulf, accompanied by a small guard of Sepoys for his dignity and personal protection, and to his receiving from you co-operation in acquiring a dwelling, and to your treating him on the principles of friendship and protection. (6) You must agree to a change in the character of the postal arrangement, which is at present irregular, and the installation of an office on the lines of those employed at other Gulf ports at which mail steamers call. And if you do not bring yourself to comply with the first four of these conditions in the period of 48 hours above mentioned, I shall have no alternative but to ask His Excellency the Admiral to take such steps as he may deem necessary for the exaction of the said demands. These demands which I have made upon you are not made with a view of encroaching on your Shaikhship, but on the contrary, for the strengthening of your rule, and because the requirements of civilisation and trade call for them; and as I explained to you verbally the British Government has been protecting and looking after you Shaikhs like children for upwards of a century, and it is not posssble that you should forget that and should persevere in this primitive conduct of yours for all time. This is what had to be explained* May you be preserved. P. Z. Cox, Lieut.'Col., JP Dated 29th December 1910, Translation of a letter from Shaikh Butti-bin-Soheil, Shaikh of Debai, to Colonel Resident in the Persian Gulf, in reply to the ultimatum addressed to him on the 29th December 1910. Dated Debai, 30th December 1910. After compliments. I have duly received your esteemed letter and have understood what you wrote. The upshot of the discussion where we left it at the time we separated was— That the pole indicating the rise and fall of the tide in the Khor of Debai hould be erected.30 That 400 rifles should be delivered up as a fine for the attack on the landing party from H. M.'s Ship. ■ That 50,000 rupees should be paid if I did not accept the telegraph a British Agent, and a Post Office. s _ In the present letter you have placed the telegraph among the four condi tions of which you require the fulfilment without fail. - I am hot loth to comply with your requirements, but you are a powerful Government and we are weak people and my dependents are an ignorant com munity, sailors and junglis, and I am even in great difficulty to administer their own internal affairs. I, therefore, take refuge in God and then in the British Government, and beg them, if their views in regard to me are bene volent, and if they desire me to remain in Debai, to refrain from the contem plation of measures calculated to bring upon me trouble in my town, and to result in the displeasure of Government towards me. I beg Government to walk with me in the path which has been followed in the past. If on the Other hand Government does not want me to remain in Debai I accept the situation and recognise that I cannot oppose them, and it were better- that I left the place rather than place myself in a position to cause them annoyance or to put me in a dilemma like the present one or perhaps something worse, at a future time. But so far as we Can do so we will comply with the demands of Govern ment, in the directions mentioned, though without doubt we shall bring upon ourselves difficulties of the nature mentioned below, difficulties tending to result even in danger to my life. Nevertheless in order to satisfy Government I see no alternative but to comply. &lt; li 1 Firstly. —With reference to the pole which indicates the rise and fall of the sea in the Khor. It should be placed at a spot in the Khor of Bebai where it could not be objected to by the inhabitants, or annoy them again. For on the first occasion the place chosen was close to a part of the beach used for purposes of nature, both by men and women, along the sea shore ; and the crew, of the ship's boat, with field glassess in their hands, used to watch the Aotc.—Probably greatly exaggerated if indeed it people. Again daily 3 or 4 times, the has any real foundation in fact. Crew of the boat USed to COme Out naked 1 e m ; ) * ' 1 and with their private parts displayed and .walk about on the sea shore among the people who were obeying the calls of nature. .This is a serious matter with us and Your Honour will not agree to it. Secondly.—'With, reference to the telegraph. If Government insist on the installation of it, then it must be put up at a spot where I approve, and on the understanding that the operators have no right to interfere in my town or with my subjects, except in connection with the telegraph work.' 'And what ever may be their needs I will arrange for them, and 1 to the utmost )f my strength and ability I will exert myself for the protection of the telegraph station. , : t ; , : ^ n ' ' ' ■ Thirdly. —With reference to the fine of 400 Martini rifles. I will produce as many as I can of the rifles, and for the rest I ask the kindness of Govern ment that a fair price per weapon be fixed in rupees. Fourthly, —As regards the 50,000 rupees. I undertake to pay them and will deliver them to you, and the decision of Governmnet as to their disposal shall be sufficient for me. v. r- ^ i Fifthly.—1 beg for a guarantee of immunity to reassure me, and that you will not impose on me what is beyond my power. Indeed the measures in question are beyond my strength and ability, but in order to ensure the safety of the community and to remove the displeasure of Government from the town of Debai, I see no alternative but to comply with the demands under reference. May you be preserved. Dated 30th December 1910.81 Translation of letter addressed to the Shaikh of Dehai by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated the 30th December 1910. - .i After compliments —1 duly received jour letter of to-day's date by the hand of Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif, and have understood its contents. I am very glad to find that good counsels prevailed with you. Firstly—As regards the tide pole. There is of course not the slightest intention that you or your subjects should suffer annoyance from it, and it is agreed that when the pole is replaced, it shall be erected at a spot which you consider suitable, provided that the Captain of H. M. Ship also approves of it. You and the Captain might choose the place together. v Secondly. —As to the telegraph installation. The place for the pole shall be decided upon in the same manner as above mentioned. That is to sav it shall be erected where you and the Captain may jointly consider best. And there is no intention that the telegraph operators shall interfere in the affairs of your town or of your Subjects. They ; will only be concerned with their telegraphic work. - ; ^ Thirdly. —With reference to the surrender of rifles. It is difficult for us • Note .- It is believed to be the case that Shaikh Butti is not in to UndGrstand llOW it is that a sufficiently strong position to deprive any of his subjects of their Trrm AdPt rifles, and probably ail he can do is to collect what he can from his ^ Cannot Collect 400 PlfleS. immediate paid retainers.

I expect you tomorrow 2|: hours after sunrisei This is what had to be explained. P. Z. Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Dated the 30th December 1910.REPORT OF THE}' LANDING AT DEEAI OF' THE ROYAL MARINE DETACHMMT AND DETAILS UNDER IIAJOR HERIOT R.M.L 0 I. DECEMBER 24TH, 1910 0 ; On the evening of Friday Dec. 23rd, orders were given to i prepare a landing party of 2 Naval Officers and 32 seamen and 2 Officers R.M. and 32 Ptes R.M.,rank and file. The parties paraded at 5 a.m. and left at 5.30 a.m. with 100 rounds per man, 2 maxims &amp; ammunition. The party landed in the 1st &amp; 2nd cutters and the gig, in tow of the steamhoat. Party landed at 6 a.m. (Just before dawn) and boats were made last astern of the sailing pinna.ce (which had anchored over night in the creek.) Lieut. Noakes - who was in command of the pinnace - joined the party with 6 men on landing. The Captain with the whole landing party proceeded to Thane bin Thalyfa's house (marked 'A' in sketch 1.) He gave me orders to surround the house and allow no one in or out. The house was then searched, and one corpl. &amp; 6 Marines were sent back to the boats to fetch picks &amp; shovels. When these arrived the floor of a suspicious feense was dug up,! and three old rifles were found (they were of an obsolete pattern &amp; would have been dangerous to fire.) About 7.30 the Captain withdrew the party of seamen, leaving me in charge of the R. Marines, and he informed me that he was: going to Ahmed's House (marked B on sketch.) 8.15 a.m . I heard several shots in a S.W. direction: heading these I ordered my working party to get their gear ono Meajnwhile Cpl.Callaran - who had taken up duties as signaller ori'the roof (the Chief Yeoman having left to join the Captain) - reported 8 or 9 Arabs running down a., street between us &amp; the beach in a. S.W. direction, armed with rifles. I closed the Detachment and formed the order of march with room the intention ~Joining ; the intention of ©iesiHg the Captain, but not knowing exactly WIIGI^O he was • Just before starting we heard rapid firing which appeared to come from the S.W., hut as it was impossible to tell exactly from which direction the sound came (owing to the echo from the houses ) 1 made as last as possible ior ubc beacho cJusTj before arriving at the beach I sent Lieuu# I\03.hes wiuh a few men round one side of a large compound while I went round the other. On arrival at the beach I found Lieut, Eoahes in position and engaged in trying to draw the fire of the enemy which was concentrated on a seaman who was taking shelter behind a- fishing boat (as shown in the sketch 1.) I immediately joined Lieut, Noakes and ordered the paruy to entrench themselves. I considered this proce|dure essential, as the seaman in the water (A.B.V'iiiiams ) was wounded, cc could not be left. As soon as I arrived firing opened firom all sides and within a few minutes Pte. Geater was wounded. Several other casual ties shortly followed. These casualties, and the dangerous position of the seaman in the water, prevented me leaving the position I had taken up. AT 9.25 I made the following signal:- 'Major Heriot and party is here. Of Captain's party can find no trace. At 9.30 owing to the heavy firing from the K. end of uhe town I made 'I would propose you bombarding Kbrth end ox' town about 700 yards to north i|i (us 0 Keep look-out for Captain,' At 9.30 I received a message from the Captain worded roughly as follows (the message was conveyed by an Arab) 'If you can possibly join me without undue loss, do so,' To which I replied 'I am in position on the beach about 300 yards to the North of the boats and as I have some casualties and a man in the water I cannot move.' Ii/t it 9.45 I made - - fvI -7 o I 'a v : ■ 1 1. I Ai 9.45 I b ?, mde 'We have five wounded. Surgeon will not be able to land unless you bombard the town.' At 9.48 I made 'Bombard near beach to North of us,' At 10 a.m. fire was opened from the ship and silenced the hh ± snipers from the north. Just before the bomba,rdment there was a lull: 1 made two Arabs accompany me, went down to the water's edge, and shouted to Williams to walk ashore - which he did. As soon as he got ashore he collapsed, and I shouted for 178 pteA.il. Hal lam 180 Pte F,J,Sandham volunteers to carry him. Three privates came 174 pte E.G.Hall out. Meanwhile the firing recommenced on the rescuing party, (the Arabs then bolted ) As these three men could not manage him 1 called out for ■938 pte D,G,Davies 9 another volunteer. Pte Davies came out. As Williams was being brought in he was hit , and I afterward found that he had got 7 wounds. At 10.g I made the following signal 'I report 6 wounded, S head cases. Send doctor, ' (This was not received by the ship,) At 10.15 I received the following 'Am I to continue uorub^i'^a- if so are shots suitably placed. Is anything Imown of cap- &gt; taino' At 10.20 made following ' Surgeon is urgently needed. : Bombardment must continue to North of town. Shots slightly too short. Do'nt fire to south 01 us.' At 10.35 received following 'An sending doctor in whaler. ^■ Signal him how and where to land.' M At 10. 35 I made 'Some men with Moussa sa came down to the beach. Moussa swam off to boats. Men went back, apparently : Captain's party about 300 yards south oi us. At 10.50 I received the following from the Captain 'Beach Party (Major ) House Party (TNoaJtes) - I am now ao Sheikh's house with the sheikh. - I want to collect all parties there - Sheikh vouches that they will not be fired ^n Come along quickly and do'nt ^1^°^^!. ImpoltLntIt's most important not to start all tlie excitement add firing again. J.D.D, 10.40 a.m.' This message was brought by one of the sheikh's men under a white f lago At 10.45 the whaler with I'leet Surgeon Mtftiday, Lieut. Miles R.M.L.I &amp; first aid arrived. As the boat was being beachei they were on. . The sheiKh's manirao brought the above message asked for my party to cease firing and get up - which we did. The stretchers &amp;c. were then removed from the whaler. At 11 a. m. made following signal 'Captain is at Sheikh s house. We are to make our way there now. Firing to be discontinued. We are moving as soon as the wounded are embarked in boat. We have five wounded, one dead.' At about this time I endeavoured to send Lieut. Kcakes bo the Sheikh's house where the Captain was, but he was pre vented from going by the Sheikh's men (it not being then considered safe.) I then received the following message from the Captain 'Go on board pinnace if it is easier than coming hk too: to Sheikh's house. J.D.D. ' Lieut. Miles was then sent with the whaler to where the rest of the boats were moored and brought a cutter back. The wounded were put into it: the cutter then removed two more wounded from the sailing pinnace and returned to the ship in tow of the steam cutter. The other cutter then transferred ±4® scfete my party to the sailing pinnace. While I was embarking in the sailing pinnace Lieut. Adam arrived and reported that all firing was to cease, that the Captain was at the Sheikh's house, and that we we-e to embark in the sailing pinnace and proceed on board as quickly as possible. Also that the remaining boats - gig, cutter, and whaler - were to be sent on shore lor Captain's party - which was done.1Z 5 , As far as I could understand, the Sheildi's man told us to hasten as there were men coming from the direction of I Sharjah, and that he would have no control over them, and that they would probably fire on the boats leaving the shore. The conduct of the men in carrying out this action was, in my opinion, exemplary under the most trying circumstances The men were exceedingly cool, there was no wild firing, and orders were carried out promptly and willingly. The wounded, who must have been in great agony, took ■ their suffering without a murmur. The town itself through which we had to pass to get to the beach, consisted of a net-work of very narrow streets which seldom ran straight for more tham 10 to SO yards, and were of an average width of 2 to 3 feet (except the # V main street, which was 10 feet wide.) These alley-ways were commanded either by high houses ar walls 16 feet high or by palm-leaf compound walls through which they were shooting. T.imit. Brewer did most excellent wort.

Cox, C.S .I., C .I .E., Political Resident in the Persian Guld, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to reply, in amplification of my message* of • Serial No. 39. 6th instant, to Poreign Department tele- t Serial Ko. 27. gramf No. S.—3, dated 3rd January, on the subject of the action recently taken at Debai. I beg leave to discuss the several points touched upon in the latter com munication, in the order of allusion. 2. The search took place without the —This is the case; but it must be remembered that on the last occasion on which the Shaikh's presence and co-operation were asked for, they were only forthcoming in a way calculated to defeat the object in view and to make any search abortive. In the present instance, Captain Dick believed that he had given the Shaikh every opportunity of being present; and even if it be true that, as the Shaikh asserts, no message reached him overnight regarding the contemplated landing, it cannot reasonably be supposed that the Shaikh received no message from, or news of, Captain Dick's party in the morning, and knew nothing of the landing of 100 men within a stone's throw and within sight of his dwelling, at the time or until so long afterwards as to prevent his joining the party for nearly two* hours. That the action of the Captain of H. M. S. ' Hyacinth ' was prudent, I am not prepared to maintain. Captain Dick indeed realised that he was taking considerable risk, but thought it was one which the circumstances warranted him in taking. The chances of trouble were, however, undoubtedly great and to one more familiar, as I am, with Arab character and oriental prejudice generally, would have seemed to amount almost to a certainty. But, on the other hand, the Shaikh's contributory negligence was patent, and to have overlooked the fact and to have admitted, in spite of the Shaikh's supine attitude, that the action of the Commander of His Majesty's ship was unjustified, would have had the effect of preventing us from taking any notice of the incident, a course which in my judgment would have been in the highest degree prejudicial to our interests in the Gulf, and would greatly have weakened the hands and damped the initiative of all the Commanders of His Majesty's ships in these waters, engaged as they now are, on highly responsible and difficult duties in connection with the arms blockade. 3. Some of the conditions imposed, such as the imposition of a fine of 50,000 rupees seem to the Government of The four conditions which we called upon the Shaikh to complv with within 48 hours were— (i) Replacement of tide pole. (ii) Acceptance of Telegraph installation as required by treaty, when ever desired by the Government of India. (iii) Delivery of 400 serviceable rifles. (iv) Delivery of 50,000 rupees pending reference to Government, with possibility of restoration in the event of compliance with two other conditions, or retention as a fine, as the Government misht decide. I submit that (i) and (ii) could hardly be considered onerous under any circumstances. As regards the 400 rifles the position was this. The recent incident had demonstrated the fact that practically every adult in the town, except the British Indians, was possessed of a rifle and cartridges, including the large community (between 200 and 300) of Persian shopkeepers, who are supposed to be men of peace and not to need them and whom the Residency Agent was much surprised to find, for the first time, fully armed. It is undoubtedly these48 I Betty shopkeepers hailing from Lingah, Lar and Bastak, whom we are indebted to for the present troublesome traffic in small consignments of arms from the Trucial Coast. It did not seem an onerous condition to ask the Shaikh to levy a fine of a rifle from a very small proportion of those who had so freely used them against our men. As a matter of fact, however, the Shaikh s autho rity was not sufficient to enable him to confiscate more than 300 weapon and for the rest he substituted cash at the rate of 100 rupees per n e. The sum of 50,000 rupees was suggested by me to the Admiral as a suit able figure with full knowledge of the Shaikh's financial position and of the extent to which he would be able to levy contribution from his notables and subiects. The Shaikh accepted this condition so promptly that I was rather inclined to think that he was prepared for a higher figure. In any case it will be realised from the terms of my letters to the Shaikh that Government are not committed in regard to the disposal of this amount, and I may add that it was my hope that Government would decide to authorise me to tell the Shaikh that they felt it necessary to press the installation of a British Aeent and a Post Office and to add that if he met their wishes, which were for the good of his town and himself, in a tractable way, the money fine would be refunded to him. 4 The CrovcTTiyyiC'Ht of Xvidict shou ditions of the ultimatum. —I have the honour to explain that His Excellency the Commander -in-Chief and I left for Debai at very short notice, and that it was only on the way thither that we learnt the details of what had taken place. On arrival we found that the populace had all sent their women and children out of the town into the hinterland and that the Shaikh feared to come off, as usual on seeing my flag, until he he had received a safe conduct in writing from me. It was clear in fact from the Residency Agent's report that they had anticipated immediate hostilities and were pleasantly surprised at not getting them. These people do not understand deliberate methods of justice and it would have been difficult to prolong such a situation as existed while we attempted to exchange telegraphic communications with Government by wire less, which was liable to interruption from atmospherics at any moment, in the most uncertain weather which prevailed at the time. As to whether the conditions we imposed were suitable or the reverse the Government of India must decide, but I cannot think that the situation was one which could have been delayed without prejudice while we made references to Calcutta and awaited replies. 5. The idea or installing a British Agent hy bombardment, —This is not quite what His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief and I contem plated, and I think it is perhaps a case in which telegraphic brevity or faulty expression has conveyed a wrong impression. We had no primary wish to install an Agent by bombardment, indeed we were greatly averse to any bombardment at all, as calculated to cripple the port from a trade point of view for some time to come. We had every hope that the action taken in the present connection would demonstrate to the Shaikh and his people that they must make up their minds to fall in with the reasonable requirements of the protecting Power, and both the Eesidency Agent and the Shaikhs of Shargah and Umm-el-Kawain were enjoined, and undertook, to endeavour, pending reply from Government, to influence the Shaikh and his notables in the right direction in this connection. We hoped good counsels would prevail, but we thought it conceivable that the Shaikh might be put up by his reactionary adviser to oppose the British Agent and the Post Office and that in that even tuality, in order to bring him and the intractable section of his followers to their knees, it might be necessary to occupy the town for a short period after first dominating it by bombardment. As it was probable that most of the Arabs would bolt to the desert very shortly after the fire commenced from the ships, we had to consider the question of dealing with some 2000 well -armed men, and for that reason it was considered necessary to have sufficient force at hand in case the worst happened. It was thought probable that the majority of them could be withdrawn after a very short occupation.49 Under any circumstances it was only intended to demolish the fort and then some of the outlying houses, sufficiently to demonstrate the power of modern guns. Fire was only to he continued for ahout ten minutes and then to cease for a period in order to give them every chance of coming in, our whole object being to do as little damage as possible with the achievement of autli the object in view. After a short time we anticipated that the populace eapjin would get used to the presence of the British Agent, and he could then be left with a strong guard which could gradually be reduced; the more quickly if 1 Sl) jj a wireless station be created. oitlj 6. The Government of India consider an occasional vi esanj Consul in one of His Majesty's Ships will he sufficient for the pr sent. tain I shall be discussinsc the question of the need for a British Agent at Debai on its general merits in a later paragraph, and beg to defer my remarks on ^1 this point until then. mom, 7. A situation has been created ithojij dangerous development', and the tionj] hining has to be guarded against, —I do not think it is at all the case in fact that a dangerous situation has been created on the coast e j l generally. I have close personal acquaintance with all the Shaikhs indi vidually. Shargah and Umm-el-Kawain displayed no more than a detached ,, interest in what had happened, accompanied by the expression of a some i friendly regret that the Shaikh of Debai had fallen out with Government. !I1 2J They both gave their effective co-operation. Bas-el-Khaima has been most w friendly to His Majesty's ships as also has Umm-el-Kawain. Among them- n p selves the Shaikhs' interests and tribes are quite distinct, and I do not at present see the least grounds to apprehend any combination. On the contrary, I hope that the action taken so far as the Trucial Coast is concerned will have a salutary effect. In this connection I may add that wireless reports from the coast received up to date show that the position is quite satisfactory. 8. The Shaikhs and their peop ^ 51 Hfl 1 ' have no intention of weakening their ing arms for their own use —There is, I am confident, no misapprehension among them on this score. The above facts were specifically reiterated to the three Shaikhs above mentioned when present at Bebai. They were well aware of them and gratefully acknowledged them. Up to ml quite recently I have been dealing with applications from them for permits ion if ; for the passage of a few arms for their own use, and they do not hesitate ifem to make them or I to grant them in reason. 9. The object of our action on ii-1 arms to Petsia in which course the British Government are 'acting as Agents to the Persian Government and at their request.' —I venture with eyitj the highest respect to ask the Government of India to consider whether primi it is correct vis-a-vis the Trucial Shaikhs to say that we are acting as aV es far as their coast is concerned as 'Agents for the Persian Government' point or at their request ? jniifi We have no delegation from the Persian Government to act for them in Jiattl the territorial waters of the Trucial Shaikhs. I submit that in those waters we are acting as Agents of the Shaikhs themselves, in their interests Sbatf and in our own, in order to prevent arms going through Persia peaif to arm the tribesmen on both sides of our North-West Frontier, tlie c As protecting Power we have decided to take their delegation of authority for [ biitf granted and they fully recognise the position. So far as they know we are ^jjonii acting in defence of our own vital interests and it is on that understanding that ia teft I have repeatedly impressed upon them their obligation to cooperate with us, | 01fe [s and I consequently submit any communication to them in the sense of the 0( [ at concluding sentence of your telegram is in any case inexpedient and in fact ■jj-dft unnecessary. roiii' What 1 have understood to be the position as above described was again \\.0 impressed on the Shaikhs of Debai, Umm-el-Kawain and Shargah and at our forcti recent interview with them at Debai, and I feel confident that they are under majoii no misapprehension in regard thereto.% 50 10. Having given such explanations as I am able to afford in regard to the several points indicated by your telegram under reply, I venture to add the following further remarks. The character of the present Shaikh of Debai. —Under his predecessor, Shaikh Makhtoom, Debai was the best ruled of the Trucial Coast ports. Writing on the subject in the Administration Report for 1904-05,1 recorded the following remarks on the subject:— ' The administration of this Chief is the most enlightened and promising of any of the Trucial Chiefs and is justifying the enterprise of the British India Steam Navigation Company in making Debai a fortnightly port of call.' Unfortunately Shaikh Makhtoom did not last long after that report was written, and in recording his death in February 1906, I wrote that his cousiu Shaikh Butti who had succeeded him was less enlightened and was not likely to prove so amenable to reason as Makhtoom had alA?v ays been. That forecast has been fully borne out. Shaikh Butti has always been a difficulty. He is pleasant enough to meet personally, but is a most unreliable and unsatisfactory ruler and during the five years of his incumb ency has gradually allowed his community to get thoroughly out of hand. As the Shaikh of Umm-el-Kawain remarked to me;—'There are 100 Shaikhs in Debai.' My difficulty in dealing with him has been that whereas when I interview him personally upon any matter of importance he invariably appears to have quite come round to one's view, yet as soon as one has left he generally writes to say he has discussed matters with his advisers and as they are not in favour of the proposal, he trusts he will be excused from compliance. In these matters the influence of the Residency Agent counts for very little, and it has thus been difficult to make any progress with Shaikh Butti. At my last visit to Debai, previous to the present occasion (in August last) Shaikh Butti discussed the question of the Post Office quite freely; admitted that the present makeshift arrangement was unsatisfactory and verbally agreed, if I thought it advisable, to have a more regular office. Similarly in discussing the pending retirement of Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif, owing to ill-health, Shaikh Butti himself expressed a wish for a succes sor of a different type and heard without demur or comment some queries put to me by some of the British Indians residing in Debai as to who the new Agent would be and whether he could not be an European. I rather thought the Shaikh would now be glad of the appointment of an Englishman, if only to strengthen his own hands in dealing with his troublesome relatives; and his cousin and Vazier, Butti-bin-Rashid, even went so far, when visiting Major Knox a month or six weeks ago when the latter touched at Debai on his way to Bahrain, as to express the opinion that the best thing for Debai would be the presence of a British Agent. Erom these indications I anticipated that I should have little difficulty in getting Mr. New satisfactorily installed if I took took him down myself and had the moral support of one of His Majesty's Ships for the occasion. 11. The question of our relations Firfe correspondence ending with Residency letter gen The need for Specific steps tO No. 173, dated the 12th December 1902. strengthen OUr influence OU this coast was fully realised by the Government of India a decade ago. Again, five years later when the question of Mr. Gaskin's future was under ndeResidency letter No. 198, dated the soth consideration, the post of British Agent Apni 1905. at Debai was one of the alternative means suggested for employing him. The difficulty of the position generally and the urgency for remedying it were also drawn attention to at pages 7 and 65 of the Residency Administra tion Report for 1906-07, and again in my despatch No. 1726 of 6th June 1908 (paragraph 15). I would then refer to the recommendation of Mr. Charles Akers and of the Board of Trade to which reference was made in my telegram No. 115 \ ^ A 'x 1 jmmmm61 of 3rd March 1909. At that time after careful study of the position I deprecated the appointment being carried out for the present for the consider ation explained and suggested, as a compromise, that the officer to be appointed as Vice-Consul at Lingah should visit Debai occasionally as necessity required and opportunity offered. Since then nearly two years have elapsed during which the situation has developed in directions which have greatly accentuated the need for the presence of a British Officer and a Telegraph Station on the coast. The interests of our own trade need it, and the attention which foreign merchants, such as Messrs. Wonckhaus and Messrs. Rosenthal, are now paying to Debai make the appointment politically important. Latterly again the indications that the coast in question is being used as a forwarding base for arms lend the question fresh urgency. It was because the .Arms Traffic question gave us specific grounds, and the presence of a large fleet of ships in the Gulf gave us means for safely installing our Agent, that I made the suggestion to send Mr. New to Lebai for this cold weather. When I asked sanction to that course I in tended to take Mr, New to Debai myself after the Admiral had left and then believed that with the support of one of His Majesty's ships I should have been able to overcome the Shaikh's objections in a friendly way and get Mr. New installed without any serious obstruction,. But the arms question began to get acute and Mr. New was on the point of leaving for Debai with the Senior Naval Officer when the recent incident occurred and upset our calculations. The Government of India now express the view that requirements will be sufficiently met by an occasional visit of the Vice-Consul in one of Hia Majesty's Ships, until such time as friendly relations have been re-established sufficient to warrant his installation on shore. I trust, however, that in the absence of unfavourable developments, the Government of India will feel able to modify their view. I cannot but fear that, if the location of the British Agent is deferred, it will be deferred indefinitely and that when the time is forced upon us there is no criterion that we shall not have the same difficulty to face then as we have now. We have naturally incurred a great deal of odium all over the Gulf in connection with the measures we are taking for the suppression of arms traffic and this recent incident will no doubt increase it j but it is inevitable that we should incur this odium and I submit that we should not let it prevent us from compensating ourselves, where possible, by using such legitimate opportunities as the course of events and the presence of our ships may afford us for strengthening our influence and our hold in places where they are operative. I would not recommend this perseverance in the present location of the British Officer, did I think that it would result in any permanent or wide spread combination or ebullition of hostility against us, but at present I see no grounds for fearing suet a contingency. I believe the idea of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief who is leaving the Gulf now, would be to carry out the installation when he returns with the necessary ships and men to carry out any naval action or demonstra tion that His Majesty's Government may finally direct at the north end of the Gulf; meanwhile, I shall shortly be visiting the Trucial Coast again in con nection with the Abu Musa case and shall have an opportunity of gauging the effect of the recent incident and action on the public mind.Telegram.

With reference to your telegram regarding the situation at Debai , dated January 6th. n &gt;4? | The following telegram has been received from the . Secretary of State, please;telegra-ph your views. Begins;- ' It would seem that the requirements of the moment . . N are summary punishment and payment of a cash compensation, but not political compensation &lt;bf a kind that would inevitablv «/ give rise to suspicions of ulterior motives on our part. - I] It is further desirable that the punishment should be of a kind to act as a deterrent to other Arabs on the coast. There remains the difficulty as to the action to be taken in case the Sheikh fails to fulfil the conditions he has accepted within a reasonable time. In this connection what at action would you -oronose ? The fine levied by way of pecuniary in view of the loss of life coraDehsation should/be as large as is consistent with the Sheikh's ability to nay. As regards the prevention of the traffic in arms on the Trucial Coast , reliance must be nlacd on the vigilance of His Majesty's Ships to prevent Debai and the other ports being used, for illegal traffic. ends. Foreign « ■f Telegram p To Foreign No 35 dated 12.1.11. T , No 6 A dated 8.1.1: I am not sure whether you had read ray letter/before despatching your telegram No 23 S. * The conditions accepted by the Sheikh , in so far as is at present,possible, have been carried out by hi®.' That is to say he has surrendered the rifles and paid ud the fine of 5n^no rupees and has in concert with the Senior Naval Officer re-ere®ted the tide pole in a-radretcdnvenieht place ano selected a site for the telegra.ph installation and for quarters for the telegraph staff in case the establishment of a telegraph station is decided on by Government. As the Sheikh's refusal of the telegraph installation was a, breach of treaty the condition of its acceptance was included in the ultiuatura , but reservations were attached and British Agent both to this demand and to the reference to a Post Office / which leave Government free to proceed with these measures or not in whatever manner and at whatever time they please. All three items were regarded by me as administrative necessities just as much as political compensation. The position at Debai has remained precisely the same as descri- -bed by me in the printed Administration renort for 1906-1907 (page 7) in spite of frequent visits and friendly efforts and advice on my part, and the need for advancement has in the meantime been greatlsr accentuated by the entry into the trade of the coast of English, French and German merchants s development in the illicit trade in arms and ammunition. Up to the time of the Admiral's departure wireless reports received by him showed that the position at Debai and on the coast generally gave no cause for anxiety and future action can be deliberately considered as there is nospecific DOint needing the immediate orders of Governraent. un the 16th instant ray written reply to your telegram No S S should reach you. It was of course unlucky that the recent incident should have occurred and it is possible that we shall have to face newspaper misrepresentation but on the coast itself I do not expect any hostile development and my present opinin is that the administrative measures proposed are an urgent necessity and that we should go through with them in spite p of any oppsition that may be offered if we intend to maintain a firm hold on the coast and justify, our position as protect- -ing rsower. If we fail to undertake measures now we shall have no less difficulty in doing so later on and the backward conditions indicated by the recent incident seem to afford us amnle justification.

I have since carried out the visit and now beg to lav the follow! tip- before the Government of India. 2. On the coast generally I found conditions perfectly normal and the untowaid incident at Debai appears to have had no harmful reaction on the rulers or the inhabitants of the other principalities. The Shaikhs themselves were as usual principally concerned with their own individual interests and wants and if they did take the trouble to make any enquiries from me reo-ardino Debai affairs it was with an air of deference and detachment. Thev would ask, for instance : Did Government intend to appoint a British officer' for the coast ? When was the telegraph station to be installed ? and so on. 3. At Debai itself, outwardly and commercially, the position appeared to be quite normal. When I landed the usual friendly or curious crowd was collected on the beach, and the life of the port seemed to be pursuing the even tenour of its way; one heavily laden steamer had just discharged Cargo, and left; another was discharging during my sojourn, and the British India Steam Navigation Co.'s Agent at Lingah informed me a day or two Jater of the fact that the Company's steamers were at present taking more cargo to Debai than usual. The community of petty Persian traders, who, subsequent to the visit of the Admiral and myself, had temporarily betaken themselves to Lingah and Bandar Abbas,—after sending a mendacious round robin to various vernacular papers,—had all returned and were again plying their accustomed callings. The British Indians, too, seemed to have quite forgotten the events of two months airo and were solely concerned with the settlement of their petty commercial claims. The only concrete vestige of the recent outbreak lay in the fact that the relations of the last Shaikh of Debai, Makhtoom bin Hashar, who have always been a thorn in the side of the present ruler, and who had openly attributed the trouble with His Majesty's ship to the ineptitude of Shaikh Butti's rule and averred that it could never have happened under the regime of their deceased kinsman, still yemained in camp at an oasis 7 or 8 miles inland. They were, however, ex pected to return after my visit, and I have no doubt have done so ere this. Meanwhile, their presence can well be spared. So much for the general situation at Debai. 4. The attitude of the Chief himself. The main difficulty throughout has been the unreliable personality and self-satisfied incompetence of Shaikh Butti bin Sohail. I do not think that in the abstract he has any wish to be otherwise than on cordial terms with Government and their representative, but provided always that he be left alone to enjoy what revenue falls in his way and be not asked to take any tiresome measures to prevent his subjects conducting themselves in any truculent way they please. If he is asked to take any action at all inconvenient to himself or to assert his authority as ruler in any particular manner, he has always failed to do so except under the strongest pressure. As an indication of his natural attitude of mind I may quote the following recent instance ;— As the Government of India are aware, it was the inauguration of the oppressive Persian tariff of 1903 in the Persian ports which made it possible for Debai to supplant Lingah as a distributing centre of merchandise for the Arab coast. This was facilitated by the intelligent policy of the late ruler. Shaikh Makhtoom, who made Debai a free port as far as customs duty was concerned and contented himself with the levy of a warehouse or wharfage fee2 on each mckaw landed. During the last few years the imports have continued imireas^nd the primitive aeeo m moda,io D provM Sjadualbe^e quite inadequate,-specially covered ^ c ° m , ra0 , dat ; 0 ^'^ the mst frequeat source of complaint from British traders at Debai. Dunng the past winter? which has been an abnormally wet and stormy one, a great deal of damage has thus accrued to perishable cargo lying on the wharf and to mitigate this the drainage of the floor and the provision of more roofing has become an ur-ent necessity. On my recent visit I was asked to exert influence with the Shaikh to induce him to meet the merchants' wishes m this respect and was assured bv the traders that all they wanted could be done for 300 or 400 rupees, but that the Shaikh could not be got to go to the expense. When I pressed the matter upon the Shaikh his first rejoinder was to the following effect:— . . . « The roofed accommodation which I have provided is quite sufficient for the Debai cargo. It is true that I take warehouse fees on all packages, but I see no reason whv I should spend money on the preservation of cargo which is intended for distribution &gt; to other ports. I do not want such cargo here and if traders choose to bring it that is their look out . After a ^ood deal of discussion he ultimately promised me to comply with the representations of the traders in such a way as to remove their grounds of complaint, but it remains to be seen whether be will carry out his promise without further pressure. I must apologise for this diverson, but it supplies a useful illustration of the type of character with which one is dealing. 5. The appointment of a British Agent. The only apparent and specific outcome of the recent events is that the Shaikh has been astute enough to make use of the ' Hyacinth incident as a pretext for a professed inability to answer for the safety of a European at Debai and thus indirectly to suggest to us that the appointment of any British official, whether for political or telegraph work, is not feasible for the present. Thus when just before my visit the British India Company, in the ordinary course of routine, sent a Eurasian employe to relieve the Persian, who was acting as their Agent at Debai, the Shaikh, who had received early information of his coming from the Persian whom he was intended to replace, had him met on board with a civil letter to the effect that, owing to the resentment still felt by the inhabitants who had lost relations in the recent fight, he was unable for the present to ensure the safety of any European and there fore could not allow him to land. It is of course conceivable that the Shaikh's statement might have some foundation, but judging from what I saw and heard myself a few days Jater I cannot help thinking that his professed apprehensions were not altogether and that he is simply making use of the incident of 24th December, in order to bring about a post ponement of the appointment of the European whom he thought Government might contemplate sending, either to take charge of the existing Agency or to manage the Telegraph Station. 6 Recent happenings have at all events placed beyond doubt what I always to some extent apprehended, namely, that the Shaikh of Debai does not welcome the idea of closer British supervision over the Trucial Coast, and that this sentiment is probably shared by the other Shaikhs. It is naturally a difficult one for the latter to express frankly to the representative of Govern ment, especially having regard to the considerations on which it is based, but the Shaikh of Debai, seeing that the ' Hyacinth ' incident has provided him with a useful indirect peg on which to air the sentiment, is making the most of the opening afforded him. The grounds underlying it were adumbrated in my telegram No. 115, dated the 3rd March 1909, and are not far to seek. They are undoubtedly based on the fear that whereas at present we are represented by an Arab Native Agent, who, by long residence on their coast and intermarriage with the daughters of the community, has become more or less a member of it; on the other hand, if a British officer were appointed with a more portentious house and flagstaff, the institution would become an ever present reminder to the negro diving fraternity that in the case of real' —irwo ».,-r oppression they had a ready refuge at hand; with the result that senerally speaking the treatment, by the Arab element, of this oppressed ohL wou d have to undergo amelioration. 1 r 7. Ten years ago our position ou the Truoial Coast was speeifioally taken mto review by the Government of India, and, in the course of the correspondence 'wbicb then enstiGdj iny predecessor wrote on the 12th December 1901^ • - «For all practical and necessary purposes tlie Trucial Chiefs' may be considered to be under oui pioteotion and there is no necessity to make this protectorate more formal unless and until future developments in the Gulf make it advisable'. In the decade which has since passed there have undoubtedly been a ffood many developments, and, while all around them the maritime communities have made some measure of progress in the direction of civilization, the Trucial Chiefs have practically stood still. There has been no want of effort on the part of the representative of Government to cultivate and keep in touch with these Shaikhs, and I personally have been afforded much better opportunities than my predecessors for doing so. For whereas formerly the personal association of the Resident with them was as a rule limited to one formal visit during the year, my own visits have been very much more frequent. I have made two extensive land journeys at different times through their hinterland and have had to visit the coast frequently m connection with the collection of material^ for the Gulf Gazetteer. I know them all well individually, and in questions of succession, and internal politics se, they seem to be no less ready than of old to look to the Resident for arbitration in their disputes and difficulties, and to accept his decisions. But so far as their external relations are concerned and the display of any inclination on their part to move with the times, I regret that I can see no change at all. They remain in the same condition of bigoted ignorance as they did ten years ago and show not the least inclination to emerge from it. 8. To revert for a few moments to past events. The Government of India are aware that Mr. New was appointed Vice-Consul at Lingah with the idea that we should be able to use him also for occasional sojourns at Debai, and thus make a beginning for a better order of things. Although I ■was not entirely free from misgiving, I was hopeful when I addressed Govern ment in November that if I took Mr. New down to Debai in the 'Lawrence' and stayed there a few days until he had had time to get on terms with the Shaikh I should be able to induce the latter to make him welcome there for a period, and that this would prepare the way for regular periodical sojourn. When the attack on the landing party of ELM.8. ' Hyacinth' was reported, all my hopes in this direction were upset, and it seemed to me either that the idea of bringing about ^ better representation on the coast must be banished altogether for a long time to come, or else that the British officer must be installed as an item of the measures taken by us in connection with the attack on our blue-jackets. The Government of India considered the latter course out of the question, and meanwhile, as was inevitable in any case, the incident has since been made the subject of much organised misrepresent ation and hostile comment in the Turkish and vernacular press, and we seem further removed than ever from the certainty of being able to instal a British representative by friendly means. Moreover as far as Debai is concerned, and its present Shaikh, I fear that the same considerations will hold, so far as they apply in regard to the project for the installation of a wireless telegraph station. 9. In this connection I would observe that even if it were not indispensi- ble that the clerk in charge of the wireless should be an Englishman, a station could hardly be inaugurated without a flag to cover it or a guard to piotect it, and under existing conditions, sceptical as I am of the of the Shaikh's apprehensions, I doubt whether it would be wise to attempt to carry the measure through without the discretion and wherewithal to use force majeure if necessary. But in any case I gather from His Excellency the Commander- in-Chief that, even if the wireless station for Debai receives early sanction.4 there will be no question of its erection before the beginning of next cold weather, so that we have several months before us in which to watch the situation. 10. In the meantime, I trust the Government of India will be pleased to take into their wise consideration the whole question of our relations with these Chiefs and the policy which we can best adopt towards them henceforward. I venture to express the personal view that, although many inconveniences will doubtless be attendant upon a tightening of our presept easy control over them, the march of events and the developments of the general political outlook in the Gulf region make it advisable, and in any case will ultimately oblige us to take definite action in that dkection. Already foreign merchants, e.g., Messrs. Wonckhaus, the German firm, Messrs. Rosenthal, the French pearl dealers, and our own subjects Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co. have either sent or desired to send European representatives to embark in the trade of the Trucial Coast; yet at present the Government of India, and the Resident as their representative with the Trucial Shaikhs, possess inadequate constitutional and legal equipment for the exercise of functions which they may at any time be called upon to perform. In this connection the enaction of a simple Order in Council would now seem called for. 11. But while, on the one hand, the disinclination of the Trucial Shaikhs to be subjected to any closer British supervision than that which they now enjoy, or suffer from, is largely based on ignorance and on consideration^ which will not stand the test of examination by the light of present day eivili- sation; and while, owing to the increasing intensity of that light, our credit as a civilised Government will ultimately oblige us to make our supervision more exacting; yet, on the other hand, we shall doubtless wish to put ourselres^ as far as we can, in the shoes of the rulers of these benighted principalities and regard with what sympathy we may their fear of the search-light. At any rate we need to make the process of evolution as easy for them as we can and to let it operate in the way calculated to draw upon ourselves the minimum amount of resentment and unpopularity. As far as I can see at present and havin 0 ' regard to the unreliability of the present Shaikh, any pi'oposal that might be made in the near future for the location of a British officer at Debai, even as a periodical sojourner, will probably be met with opposition, real or engineered, and I feai there will be no greater certainty of putting the measure throusb by purely amicable means than there was in December last, and that the installation of a telegraph station at Debai with European staff will be a little-less delicate operation. 12 In these circumstances, it occurs to me that the little enclave of Zora, between Ajman and Uamriyeh, may be considered to offer us a convenient base and more simple means for the location of our telegraph station and the insertion of the wedge of more effective control. The situation and history of the Zora tract will be found described in the Persian Gulf Gazetteer Its occupation has always been such an apple of discord among the Shaikhs themselves that we have been obliged to prohibit such occupation. Its^positioii is central, and it possesses a good Khor on the Ajman side for the use of native craft; while an anchorage could probablv be found at some point off it which would be no worse than those existing at other ports along that coast. On shore we should start with a spacious and un« obstructed tract of ground and it seems conceivable that if we were to make the place a tree poit lor the import of merchandise for distribution, we mkht the spread of influence and civilisation? by example LVc^^^ by any sterner measures, ' 1 nJPf W0Uld i be m f Ae - tlle landil1 g and installation of the staff and guard for the wireless station, with their gear and the necessarv E P tent* tor their accommodation at the beginning of the cold weather.' At the moment of their disembarkation the Shaikh? of Ajman and Hamriveh in the mstauce ' and thett the Shaikhs ginerallj, wonld to notifiedpersonally that, in order that the telegraph system might interfere as little as possible with their sensibilities or the populations of their towns, we had decided to locate it at Zora, and required lor it from all of them the respect and^ protection to which it was entitled under treaty. Once our telegraph station was installed the rest would gradually follow, automatically, and we should thus be rendered quite independent of the co-operation or opposition of the Shaikh of Debai and his community. The Government of India may perhaps think the idea a visionary one. hut it seems to me to possess convenient possibilities, and I submit it respect fully for consideration. It will of course be understood that, in the foregoing paragraph, I have merely indicated very roughly the line^on which I think we might proceed, and it goes without saying that should the suggestion commend itself to GovermmBt these lines would need to be carefully plotted out. 'With apologies for the length of this oommunioation, of which I am sending a copy to His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, in that it has a bearing on the wireless question.

Bm Reports from the sfaiiis and boats stationed on that coast shei* that everything is quiet thore, una as far ae can be seen the Dibai incident has not had the effect of inflaaiag the Arab against tho European as stated in some of the Indian newspapers* It is quite true that the Hheikh of Dibai is still trying to prevent any Europeans from settling in hie town, and in this ho is probably encouraged by the owners of the pearl dhows, who fear investigation into their method of dealing with the divers, most of whoa are said to be si«ves. It is however more bluff th«n anything else, and if the question were taken in hand seriously, I feel sure that a settlement could be arrived at without sore bloodshed. 3. I would suggest that the best way of bringing this * about would be to proceed with the erection of the Wireless telegraphy Station, the site for which was She Secretary to the ; i' ' ^ ■ i u ;' i GcveniEiont of India, in the V\ 7 7. 1 selected hy Captaia A.2.Hunt in conjunction with tiie Shoikh. Slis i at tor def initsiy agr®®d to allow the telegraph to be installed as part of the terms of the altimatym which was cu_ptcici oy him on the SQufe* Decemberg 1910» If he is not sade to abide by these terms, he may give considerable trouble in the future, when it may become necessary in the interests of the whole Trucial Coaat to force the various Shuilshis to accent a certain oeasure of British control for their own protection against Foreign Powers. I think the difficulty of dealing with them has been exaggerated, and is not so great as would appear at first sight. Although loosing large on paper, these Sheikhs are in reality very small men. Shey have not any cohesion, and each town acts almost entirely in What it considers to be its own interests, quite independently of anything that the others aay think. • j 4. She question which is likely to arise in a very short time is that of the Pearl Fisheries. Great Britain has policed and maintained order on these baaJcs for nearly a century, but as long as we have not a definite status % vis a vis the Arab tribes who use them, which is i^ecognised by Foreign Powers, we cannot enforce our control over any vessels on the banks who may fly the colours of France, Germany, or other European Countries. Firms in both France and Germany are reported to be considering whether they.115 I * «!• -V \ Q they shall fit out pearling expoditions forth© Persian Gulf, using drsdgts and ali sorts of modern ap^.-iiances, which, if carried out, would probably mean the speedy working out of the banks. The Arab tribes who fish the banks are alssost entirely dependent on the result of the season * s work for their , as agriculture or other pursuits are not possible for them* Even if the bunks be not worked out, the competition introduced will seriously threaten the welfare of the divers. 6. Of the tribes who regularly fish on the banks Great Britain nominally controls the greater number• Others, such as those on the Katr Peninsula, have not made treaties with us, but thoy probably would do so with little persuasion. Others again, as at Ai Eatif, are under Turkish control; and lastly there is Kuwait, the f position of the Sheikh of which is doubtful, to say the least of it, at the present moment. ?• As I have already pointed out, cohesion does not exist amongst the tribes, and they can not and will not uct together. It therefore follows that, unless we are prepared to see them subjected to a coep etition which can but have one ending, the ruination of the Arab owner, and to see the prestige of Great Britain, as the Power that has for nearly a century looked after th® interests of all the tribes in the Gulf, pricked like a bubble the moment. \I 7,4- icoaoat that tre find ourselves face to face with another Baropean Power, we must taKe action beforehand and make such a position for ourselves, not only w do facto' but * — •% w de 4ur0 H , that wo can irapose the conditions under which * * |,»0arl i isnin^ shall 'bo carried out 'by overybod'y who asay wish to use the banks. 8« la the f irst place it seesia to be aecessury to proclaim to th@ '-vox*iu at Isup&amp;s our Protectorat© over the Crucial Coast, by issuing an Order in Council as is being don© with respect to Bahrain. 2h© order will have to be drawn on a very elastic basis, und the Resident in the Persian Gulf will have to be given very large discretionary powers at first with retard to the administration. Some sort of control over the administration of the Chiefs will have to be introduced, and it is for this reason that I have urged the establishment of the Wireless Selegraphy Station at Dibai as a coranenceiaent. 9. fhe greatest difficulty with which w© shall be faced will be that of the status of the pearl divers, and in this matter we mist show ourselves to be patient and somewhat mora tolerant than usual. It would appear that only two alternatives face us; one is to introduce administrative action on the fracial Coast slowly and care fully so as to bring the tribes more effectively under British guidance; and the other is to leave them alone and let their only property be exploited by none too ( scrupulousI 7,S scrupulous Foreign firms, who would not car© for the traditional owners of the pearl banks as long as they could Eako as Eoch as possible out of thoa, and for Grsat Britain to lose ©vory vastige of prostig® that sh@ 10. In tho second wo should antor into treaty r@latit&gt;ns with tho Katr chiofs, and indue® thoia to act with us in this smttsr, and to doputo us to rsprssont thoir interests on the banks, agraoing to abide by our regulations If they would accept a full Protoctorato 2roaty, so much tho bettor. Similar action should be tttkon with ragurd to Kuwait in so far us deputing us to act for the Shaikh is concerned. As regards Bahrein, I have considered that pJUo© as definitely under British Protection in a way that cannot be disputed. 11# We should then issue and enforce regulations on the banks very similar to those which are already customary amongst the Arabs, but they should be published so that all should know of them. In particular tho use of any dredge or other siechanical appliance for obtaining the oysters should bo prohibited. She natural history of the oyster beds should also be invostigsted scientifically, ft' 1 Qi no id air, us has been dona in Geylon, and the extent and position of all the pearl bearing beds in the Gulf definitely ascertained. In this way it is possible that gradual improvements may be introduced into- the fisheries, and the yield of the banks increased. .

I beg to state that the Captain of H.M.S.'Fox ,, sent the steam cutter on the 22nd June 1911 to Shargah inviting me to go to him on the man-of-war which was at anchor off Ajman. I went to him immediately by the launch and called on him. He stated to me that he had asked the Sheikh of Ajman to come on board with a view to having an interview with him, but that the Chief had declined to do so, on the pretext of being in disposed and busy, 'e sent me therefore to bring the Sheikh to the man-of-war. As desired by the Captain, I went to the Sheikh of Ajman and inquired from him as to why he did not accept the Captain's invitation to call on him on board the man-of-war. The Sheikh replied that he did not wish to have interviews with the Cap tains of the men-of-war as he did not iinow them and did not un derstand their habits and motives and was ai raid of them. At length, I took the Sheikh with me to the man-of-war and the Captain told him during the interview, that he wished to erect a tido-pole In the Ajman Creek in order to jiiioiv oho a^ptn O j. the sea during the high tide and the low tide. The Sheikh of Ajman did not agree to the tide pole being erected stating, firstly that the townspeople would be frightened by its erec tion and secondly that the people of Hamriyeh who had ill- blood with the people of Ajman, would probably come to the creek at night time and remove the pole in v /hich case blame will attach the Sheikh of Ajman. As the Captain tola me tnat he will have, at any rate, to erect the tide pole m the Ajman Greek for seven days, I assured the Shbikho aga' th^ mis haps of which he was afraid in connection with the pole. he Bhoito having a B r e8 d, I returned with him to AJn.an.

On the 26th June I received a letter dated 28th Jemadi II from the Sheikh of Ajman which is forwarded herewith for your information and which is to the effect that the man- of-war visited them and landed jolly boats which erected two tide poles, one on the mouth of Zawara on a premonitory and the other below the Es Sanam tower and that they have flown flags on the shore; that the inhabitants of Ajman do not agree to this, as it is contrary to the arrangement made with the Gap- tain and that I should send some one on my behalf to Ajman be fore anything untoward takes place, xhe Sheikh of Shargah also came to me with a letter received by him from the Sheikh of Aj man in which the latter asked him to assist me to come to Aj man, Meanwhile, I received the enclosed letter dated 28th Jemadi II 1329, from Muhammad Jaafar, Interpreter of H .M .S. 'Pox' asking me to hasten to Ajman as he fearca that trouble and inconvenience will arise. I proceeded to Ajman immediately thereupon, and found a jolly boat of the man-of-war in tne in- ner side of the Greek, with a Lieutenant and several men on board. The Captain had returned to the man-of-war before my arrival at Ajman. The Lieutenant informed me of the dis cussion which had taken place between the Captain and the people of Ajman in regard to the flying of the flags (stating)that the people of Ajman evinced ill-feelings and that he (the Lieute nant) was staying in the Creek to look after the flcvgs. I tola the Lieutenant to go to the man -of-war, and inform the Captain of my arrival at Ajman stating that I will guara the ilags against removal. The Lieutenant went away and I called on the Sheikh of Ajman in his Government House and saw that he was sur rounded by all the townspeople who were armed and 'ho stated thfet11 | m- that they aid not agree to the erection of the poles in the 1 creei^ a,nd oi the flags on shore, i assured the people of Aj- man in an amicable and friendly way, that they shall experience no haria by c v ^ action or the Captain of the man-of-war, whether he erected a tide pole or flew flags, and that I would stay with them at Ajman until the Captain finished his work in the CreeJi. 1 obtained categorical assurance from the Sheikh and his subjects that they would not oppose the action of the Cap tain. In the morning of the 27th June I left the Ajman Creek and went to the Zawra Greek. The Captain came to me and I informed him that the Sheikh of Ajman and his subjects have no objection to his doings. He expressed his satisfaction. The Captain's work in the Ajman Creek lasted for three days and I used to go to the scene of the work from morning till fore noon and then return to Ajman. As desired by the Captain I went with him on board the man-of-war and he expressed to me his satisfaction for my assistance in arranging his works with out difficulty and trouble. On the 28th June he removed the poles and flags from the Qreek and shore of Ajman and Zawra, and the man-of-war left. This is what happened.^opy of a letter dated 28th Jemadi II 1329 j (26th June 1911) from Sheikh Homeid bin Abdul Aziz, Chief of Apian, to the Residency Agent, Shargah. I bbg to state that the said Ship came to us and landed Joll^- boats iffhich erected two poles, one on a promontory on the Zawra side and the other below the Es Sanam tower and erected flags on the shore below the Es Sanam tower.

Report on Khor at Zor H. M. S. ' Fox' at T amb, 3rd July igu. S ir, I have the honour to report that, in accordance with your telegram No. g6 of 8th June, I proceeded to Al Ajman on 22nd June to examine Zora Khor:— (1) as to the depth of water on the bar; (2) whether bar can be deepened ; (3) whether it is possible to improve the Khor so as to make it practic able for steamers or lighters. 2. On 23rd June, I proceeded with Lieutenant G. L. Hodson to examine the Khor, the entrance to which is the same as that to Ajman Khor. Zora Khor turns sharply to the North East, on entering, and in the,first half mile there is six to ten feet of water at low tide on the North shore ; it then opens out into three comparatively large sheets of water. It being evident that the two branches to South and East were very shallow, I proceeded up the North East Khor but found that that also dried nearly over the whole extent at low water, leaving a narrow tortuous channel of one to two feet. This branch extends for miles up the Coast, and the natives say that at one time there was another entrance which a small boat could get through, though I could find no trace of it. The Hamryia Khor, which turns to the Southward, nearly meets Zora Khor and is only separated from it by some low sand-hills. 3. On Friday, 23rd June, I sent the Navigating Officer, Lieutenant Hodson, to request the permission of the Shaikh, Humaid bin Abdul Aziz, to put up some marks and a tide pole, and to request him to come off and see me. He refused everything in a rude manner and said he was too ill to come and see me. Next day, I sent for the Native Agent for Shargah and, on his arrival, again sent for the Shaikh. He came off at about 4 p.m., and I extracted an apology from him and an assurance that I might put up a tide pole and what marks I considered necessary. 4. On Tuesday, 27th June, I directed Lieutenant Hodson and Sub Lieutenant C. H. Champness to proceed with the Survey ; they put up a tide pole and measured a base and, as there were no natural marks, 1 directe a £» s on boathook-staves to be put up, taking^ care that the flags re P[® sei of -j'? nationality. As soon as the flags were seen in the village of Ajman, the sent to say that they must be taken down at once, that a *■. e . ^ J 01 * 511 children had left and that the men were out with their rifles. ^ ine T • ^,4 messenger exactly what the flags were for, and told the Shaikh that I insistedthat the flags and tide pole were to remain where they were, and that I expected him to protect them ; during that afternoon and next day, there was much excitement in the village and stray shots fired, not at any of our party. 5. On Thursday, 29th June, having obtained what information I required I sent a message in to the Shaikh to say that I did not require him to protect the flags after noon that day, and took them down, as^ I did not think it fair to expect him to keep up the flags any longer against the wild bloods of the village. 6. A tracing of the Bar and entrance to the Khor is forwarded herewith, by which it will be seen that:— (1) there is not more than two feet at low water on the Bar, which is all sand and, though it could easily be depened, I think that it would silt up again rapidly ; (2) the entrance to the Khor being so narrow, would render it quite impossible to take even the smallest steamer into it ; (3) the North side of Zora Khor might be made quite suitable for lighters as it is deep for some little distance along. 7. In short, I do not think that the Khor could be made into a suitable harbour without incurring great expense. I have, etc., (Signed) JAMES C.

For instance it was first reported that he had sent % emissaries to Busreh: then to Abdul Aziz bin Saood: now I am told he has been in communication, through a third party with the Turkish Consul here. 1 have attached so little importance to these reports and have thought it so unlikely that Sheikh Butti would be foolish enough to resort to intrigues of such a nature, which would only serve to annoy Government without doing his interests any good, that I have not troubled to write i to him on the subject, thinking it best to ignore them.

I propose with your concurrence to instruct Cox to work out detailed scheKe. Eeanwhile, though we share view of Admiral and Cox as to desirability of tightening up our control over Trucial Chiefs, we think it better, pending negotiations with Turkey, to hold our hand in respect of Order in Council. We have hoWBV er instructed Cox to prepare one, leaving the question of publication to be considered at sor.e future period. vuvStu,The subject of this file is connected with the question of the establishment of a telegraph ■tefaon at Zora, and has wmamed with me with that file, which was awaiting the rfplies of His Majesty s Secretary of State m connection with the proposed despatch of troops to the Gulf (vide my note on the Zora Telegraph Station file). , The Secrctary of State asks the Government of India's views on the policy of extension of Bntish responsibilities in regard to the Trucial Coast, and my views on the point are It seems to me that an extension of our responsibilities is being forced upon us in the inevitable course of political development in the Gulf, and tnat we cannot help acceptincr it Dotwitbstanding the inconveniences which are undoubtedly entailed, ' (i) The first sign of the times was the decision a few years back of the British India Company to make Dtbai a port of (.all. This was due to the fact that owing to the harshness of the Belgian customs and the new Persian tariff at Liugah, Lingaa trade was diverted to Debai. Debai now became concerned in the mail and quarantine systems of the Gulf ports. (ii) We moved as little as we possibly could ia regard to both matters; a rough and informal arrangement for receipt and despatch of letters being introduced (much against the backward Shaikh^s inclinations), while in regard to quarantine we made no attempt to saddle ourselves %vith responsibility. There is, however, constant complaint from the Indian trading community and the Post Office authorities regarding the postal arrangements, while in the quarantine connec tion it will be remembered that Debai and Shargah were visited by a very severe epidemic plague in the spring with which we had no means ^n the spot, cf coping. In this connection we have informed the Tehran Sanitary Council, in order to forestall criticism, that the question of the sanitary supervision of the Trucial Coast is under the lively consideration of the Government of India. The coast will certainly want careful watching this spring and a recrudescence is very probable. (iii) The facility of communication afforded by the regular call of the mail steamer has brought a good many European visitors to the coast, bot:i English and Foreign, and such persons now want to sojourn there for trade in pearls, oyster shells, &amp;c., and look to us for facilities and assisiance, and believe themselves to b6 under quasi-British piotection while there. (iv) Owing to our action at Maskat and on the Mekran Coast, the bulk of the arms- smuggling has come up into the Persian Gulf, and the barren snd secluded tracts of the Trucial Coast prove to be safe jumping-cff places for the arms- smugglers with their consignments brought overland from Ma.skat or Sohar. This development necessitates closer supervision of the coast. The fact is that although to the world in general, so far as it is interested, we claim to manage these Trucial Shaikhs and maintain their independent status against outsiders, our own status for doing so and our machinery for handling them are crude and defective. The system worked all right when there were no European foreigners in the Gulf and things moved ranch slower than they do now—but as things are our position is unsatisfactory and the weak points of it are at once made evident, when we are brought into contact with a Foreign Government, as m the Abu Mnsa ease for instance, I agree that we want to handle these Trucial Coast nettles as adroitly as we can 7 but am convinced that they have to be grasped. At present we are only contemplating a wireless station; we can see how that project works. Probably it will not be long before we stait a regular visit on the part of an agent, and then the next step will be a simple Order in Council. The only alternative I see is to ask the British India Steam Navigation Co. to cease their call at Debai and thus to endeavour to divert Debai trade back to Lingah, but this would l&gt;e such a retrograde step that I bardJy like even to suggest it, * P. Z. Cox,—6-2-12. fI asked to be allowed to see this file because the communications which I had received left me in some doubt as to precisely what was required of me in the nature of a ' scheme Pre -occupation over the Shiraz question and the arrival of the Central India Horse and absence at Maskat had prevented my submitting any scheme before starting for Delhi. I now understand from the file and notes that the idea of a Political Agency at Zora is to be kept in the back ground (or in abeyance at any rate) for the present, and that we are only to consider the question of the installation of a wireless station. This will mean estimating for— (i) Wireless station—signalling and menial staff and quarters. (ii) Doctor, who would also look after quarantine matters in the event of epidemic on the coast. (iii) Arrangements for watering, provisioning aud protecting the same. I will proceed on these lines. Meanwhile, this qaestion of installing ourselves in some form at Zora, is one among 3 or 4 items contributing to the assertion of our position in the Gulf which, as I have mentioned to Sir Henry McMahon, seem to me to need discussion as a whole in committee, in the same way that the Anglo-Persian and Anglo-Turkish situations have been discussed. The issue of the Bahrain Order in Council is another item. P. Z. Cox,—12-1-12.Installation of Wireless at Zora. Deputy SecretaryKindly see my note of 12th January 1912 in which I wrote that what seemed to be required ot me was an estimate for— (i) a wireless installation. (ii) entertainment of a doctor, (iii) arrangements for watering and provisioning and protecting the establishment. Since writing the note above mentioned I have studied tbe'papers connected with the general scheme for wireless in the Gulf and it seems to me that there is perhaps some confusion. Thus in their telegram of 28th July to the Secretary of State, the Government of India expressed themselves in favour of my suggestion for a combined W ireless and Politi cal Agency at Zora and asked authority to direct me to work out a detailed scheme. On 24th August, before any reply had been received to the above telegram, the Gov ernment of India sent home their despatch No. 96 in which they presented tbeir general scheme for the Gulf; and in it included 'Debai (or Zora)' (sie) and gave details and estimates. Later, in his telegram of 7th September, the Secretary of State answers the Govern ment of Indians telegram of 2^th July, regarding the combined station and in approving the proposed instructions to Resident ^to submit scheme/' seems to overlook the fact that the station for Zora has since been included in the comprehensive scheme ai:d estimates already submitted. The position from my point of view is that when the gear has been got out from home and is ready for installation— (i) A doctor will have to be appointed as an item of the establishment. An Assistant Surgeon or even a 1st class Hospital Assistant would suffice. (ii) A guard of a company of Native Infantry under a British officer would have to be stationed at Zora to begin with, to be reduced in numbers when the situation admitted, (iii) E. P. tents would have to be provided for the establishment and its guard, until the ground had been examined and buildings erected. (iv) Arrangements for provisioning and watering the station by mail steamer or His Majesty^s ship would have to le made. In connection with the above, what further is needed in the way of a scheme seems to be needed from the naval and military authorities rather than from me, I would mention) however, that no work can be done at Zora in advance. The installa tion of our people there with the tents would have to be undertaken without warning to the Shaikhs except what I should give them simultaneously with our arrival. One of His Majesty^s ships will be needed, to be present during the disembarkation And to remain until the situation is assured. It was the idea of the Naval Commander-in-Chief and myself that if the gear^was ready the installation should take place while we had the force in the Gulf the despatcn of which is now under consideration, and that the company of Native Infantry should be taken from that force, but orders on the subject of the despatch of the force have not yet been received up to the time of my departure. As things are, the cold weather will probably be at an end before anything can be snd then it will become a question whether next cold weather must not be awaited. P. Z.

As shortly after the receipt of the telegram in question, Raahid arrived in company of Hamaid -bin-Khalifah statement was forwarded to you under cover of my No. 367, da e been'dis- your address, I took the opportunity, after Hamaid -bm- aa _ . ^at missed to explain the situation fully to Butti -bin-Rashid o£ the my dragoman would wait upon the Shaikh that afternoon wi better that you required from him.3. Butti-bm-RasMd replied tbat he did not think it was the slightest use the dragoman waiting on the Shaikh of Debai, as he was sure that the Shaikh, who was much dissatisfied with the way he was being treated, would certainly not sign any such letter and would also look upon it as undignified to possess rifles marked with a Government mark. I trusted, however, that reflection might bring the Shaikh to a more reasonable frame of mind and was not quite sure how far Butti-bin-Rashid might be regarded as a faithful interpreter of the Shaikh's attitude. 4. My dragoman accordingly waited on the Shaikh and reports that he showed the Shaikh the Arabic note drafted in the sense of your telegram quoted above and informed the Shaikh of the precautions which were laid down in the last portion of that telegram as necessary to be observed to enable the Shaikh and ourselves to recognise and recover weapons which have passed into unauthorised hands. 5. In reply, the Shaikh informed my dragoman that in recent affairs at Debai, he had not received satisfaction from Government; that he was unable to give the assurances implied in the telegram already quoted because the people who lost their friends in the trouble at Debai are greatly ^satisfie on account of their wrongs not being redressed; that it was for um o who should and should not land at ^ Shukh to her infomrf my dragoman, as he rose to take his departure, that he was not intending to export. any arms from here. , 6.

Sir, In forwarding herewith the copy of a note recorded by me on the 1st: February after a visit paid to me by the subject of the note , Saif bin Hamad , I have the honour to report that yesterday the news of the murder of Saif bin Hamad at Nakhai reached Masqat . It is stated that Saif was killed by the emissaries of Suiamian bin Nasir bin Muhammad , the Sheiai of the Ma'awai. 2. As Saif was at Nakhai more or less under a safeconduct from His Highness the Sultan and the Murder was committed at Hakhal , which is occupied by His Highness 1 sepoys , it is con -sidered that His Highness' honour is to some extent concerned in the affair . It is not however anticipated that he will taise effective steps to avenge the murder. 3. My informant tells me that Abdul Aziz ar Ruwaihl , the dragoman of the French Consulate , has been at the bottom of these intrigues from the beginning , that it was he who advised Saif bin Hamad to kill Nasir bin Hamad the Sheikh of the Ma'awai and who has now instigated the murder of Saif bin Hamad. 4. I am further informed that this Saif bin Hamad has had a turbulent career and that a large number of murders of ins3^- nificant persons (ray informant tells me as many as loo,persons) can be attributed to him . He bore a great reputation for brav ery . 5^ jn conclusion I was informed casually tnat Sail bin Hamad was at Debai at the time of the Debai incident of Christmas1910. that ne had bought loo, rifles which he procured from All ;-Oona to neii there; that the people of Debai would never have fired on the British sailors if he had not advised them to do so and himself fired the first shot . The Sheikh of Debai is reported to have said that Saif bin Hamad was a bird of lll-oraen who always brought bad luck, it would be interesting to know if the murder of Saif depends in any way on the visit of Sheikh Buti bin Suheil to Maskat which it so closely follow -ed. 6.

It is stated that saif was killed by 1 trie emissaries of Suiamian bin liasir bin r.uhamraad , the SheiMi of the Ma'awal. 2. As Saif was at Nakhai more or less under a safeconduct from His Ugliness the Sultan and the Murder was committed at Hafchal , winch is occupied by His Highness 1 sepoys , it is con -si do red that His Highness 1 honour is to some extent concerned in the affair . it is not however anticipated that he will take effective steps to avenge the murder, 3, My informant tells me that Abdul kziz ar Ruwaihi , the dragoman of the French Consulate , has been at the bottom of these intrigues from the beginning , that it was lie who advised Saif bin Hamad to kill Hasir bin Hamad the Sheikh of the Ma'awa: and who has now instigated the murder of Saif bin Hamad. 4. I am further informed that this Saif bin Hamad has had a turbulent career and that a large number of murders of insig nificant persons (my informant tells me as many as loo,persons) can bo attributed to him . He bore a great reputation for brav ery . 5. in conclusion I was informed casually that Saif bin Hamad was at Debai at the time of the Debai incident of Christm? 51910, tiat he had bought 103, rifles which he procured from All iioosa to sell thore; that the people of Dehai would never have fired on the British sailors if he ha I not advised them to do 90 and himself firad the first shot . The Sheikh of Debai is reported to have sail, that Saif hin Hamad was a bird of ill-omen who always brought had luck. It would be interesting to know if the murder of Saif depends in any way on the visit of Sheikh Buti bin Suheil to Maskat which it so closely follow -ed. 6.

A local newspaper recently published a version of the Debai incident on the Trucial coast purporting to come from its Basra corre spondent. It accused the British sailors of having provoked a conflict by outrages upon Moslem women. The calumny is to-day re peated, and the Jeune Turc adds that Debai is Ottoman territory and the British Government has agreed to pay compensation in consequence of the representations of the Porte. It appears that the journal which published the original story has no correspondent at Basra, and it is currently reported that the ' information' was communicated to it by a high official in the Ministry of the Interior.y 9 J-'A • t*A_/XVOV^AX 9 V-4.X«^X4L JL&lt;JfOV XJUA^O-AV» v. plague are now reported from several places i Chihli and Shantung, and there have bee four deaths at Tientsin during the last thre days.

EARTHQUAKE SHOCK AT TIENTSIN. (from our correspondent.)GUN-RUNNING IN THE PERSIAN GULP. THE DEBAI INCIDENT. (from our correspondent. ) BOMBAY, J an. 20. j Advices from the Persian Gulf state thai the preventive measures taken against gun- running are so complete that only small batche| of a dozen rifles can be landed On the Persiar shore at a time, and these only at rare intervals,: The Debai episode arose from the knowledge i that some guns were concealed in the town. IThe Sheikh denied the existence of a cache, but agreed to the search. The rifles were found buried, so picks and shovels were sent for. The demeanour of the Arabs then grew increasingly threatening, and fire was opened simultaneously on four branches of the landing party, who appeared in danger of annihilation. The Arabs were under cover, and used soft- nosed bullets, while the British were in the open till they threw up rude intrenchments on the beach. When the flag-captain personally ad dressed the Sheikh and the Hyacinth shelled the town the firing. ceased. The Arabs laid out 37 dead, and their losses were probably heavier. On December 28 Admiral Slade and Major Cox presented the Sheikh with an ultimatum. The squadron assembled to enforce it, and the Sheikh complied with all the terms. Debai has since been quiet. The Admiral has returned to Bombay in the Hyacinth to-day. 'fc, and any questions that might exist betwec le the two countries would be solved by negotu tions based on mutual.confidence.
