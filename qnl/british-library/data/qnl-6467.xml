Correspondence respecting the occu pation of Merv by Russia and her proceedings on the Khorassan Frontier of Persia. • “ Correspondenee respecting the move ments of Russia in Central Asia, and her relations with Afghanistan.” Part IV.; dated 22nd January 1884. t Memo., dated 22nd January, pp. 17 and 18. J Despatch, No. 167. Asia ; Sect. 215. § Home ; No. 133. Asia; Sect. 217. The Memorandum marginally cited* brought the story of Russian proceedings on the Khorassan frontier' of Persia down to the close of last year, the last fact of importance mentioned being the advance (reported by Mr. Thomson on the 28th December) of a considerable Russian force to the Tejend, with the object, as alleged by the Foreign Office at St. Petersburgh, of putting pressure upon the Turkomans of Merv to restore the plunder which shortly before had been carried off from Persia.f With regard to the Turkoman raids on Persian territory, which furnished the pretext for this move, Mr. Thomson wrote, on the 5th December 18834 that although the Meshed Agent’s corre spondent at Merv had stated that he had no reason to suppose that the Russians had anything to do with them, the impression at Teheran was that they had been instigated by Makhdum Kuli Khan and other Russian partisans at Merv, and that there could be no doubt that if an advance on the Tejend was contemplated, or if it were intended shortly to open negotiations for the extension of the Russian frontier beyond Baba Dormaz, the recommencement of raids by the Turkomans on the Persian border would be favourable to Russia, as it would again show the Persians how difficult it was for them to prevent such incursions, and make them more willing to see the Russians established along the north-eastern frontier of Khorassan to near Sarakhs, or even on to Pul-i-Khatun, at the junction of the Keshef-Rud with the Heri-Rud river. On the 14th February 1884 Her Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh reported the pub lication, in the Official Gazette of that day, of the following telegram sent to the Emperor, on the 12th February (31st January O. S.), by General Komaroff, Chief of the Trans-Caspian region :—§ “I have the honour of reporting to your Majesty that the Khans of the four tribes of Merv Turkomans and twenty-four deputies, each representing 2,000 kibitkas, have this day at Askhabad formally taken the oath of allegiance to your Majesty for themselves and on behalf of the people of Merv. The Khans and representatives state that the Mervees have decided on this step, being conscious of their inability to govern themselves, and convinced that your Majesty’s powerful Government alone is capable of establishing and consolidating order and prosperity m Merv.” 10061. 1.881. A''' ' In the evening Sir E. Thornton met M. de Giers, who informed him casually that the Emperor had determined to accept the allegiance of the M , Turkomans, and would send a Russian officer to Merv for the purpose of administering ^ e govern ment of that region and of establishing order therein. This officer, His Excellency said, migh perhaps he accompanied by a small escort, probably of natives, but that he hoped it would not be necessary, for the present at least, to send any Russian troops in that direction. The Ambassador had seen M. de Giers at the Foreign Office on the 13th February, when the Minister had made no mention of the telegram which had been received from Askabad. He now assured Sir E. Thornton that it was not till an hour after his departure on that occasion that the Emperor had sent him the telegram in question, and he expressed his hope that the Ambassador would not believe that its contents had been pui- posely concealed. He added that, though he had for some time expected that Russia would have to undertake the pacification of the Merv district, he had been quite unprepared for so early a declaration of the feelings of the Turkoman tribes in Merv. He hoped, however, that the steps which would now be taken would be to the advantage of the whole of that country, by establishing order and good government, and of the neighbours, Afghan istan and Persia, in preventing a continuation of the raids which had lately been so frequent, and of which the Government of the latter had recently made serious complaints, calling upon the Imperial Government to prevent them. His Excellency expressed his hope that Her Majesty’s Government would view the measures which were now about to be taken as being adopted only in the cause of peace and good order.* On the 15th February an article was published in the “ Journal de St. Petersbourg,” which Mons. de Giers said had been inspired in his office, and represented the views of the Russian Government with regard to the situation at Merv.f This article commenced by quoting some remarks which, on the first telegraphic report of what had happened, appeared in the “Times,” treating the annexation of Merv as of small account unless it were to be followed by a further advance to Sarakhs. It then continued :— “ On voit d’apres cela combien I’opinion publique Anglaise, Slur tout celle des gens serieux et competents, est revenue des auciemies preventions qui avaient fait du nom meme de Merve une espeee d’epouvantail d’autant plus exagere que cette localite sa position et sa valeur militaire et politique etaient parlaitement inconnues.

Le ‘Times’ recommit aujourd’kui que la sou mission des Merviens est la consequence naturelle et inevitable de cet etai de choseg. “ On ne pent que se feliciter de ces appreciations calmes, justes * From Sir E.

Ihe Russian Government, on the other hand, could not reject their petition without compromising the tranquillity of the countries bordering on their own possessions. In all this there was no hostile combination against England, nor any intention to take advantage of the present embarrassments of Her Majesty’s Government elsewhere. Baron Mohrenheim was instructed to assure Lord Granville that the views of the Emperor as regards the relations between the tw r o countries in Central Asia were in no way changed, and that it w r as His Majesty’s desire that those relations should continue to be marked by a spirit of sincerity, and an equitable appreciation of mutual interests. Lord Granville told Baron Mohrenheim that Her Majesty’s Government had been informed by Sir E.*Thornton of the facts, and that at this moment a draft w r as being submitted to the Cabinet on the subject. He could not pretend that the news had produced no effect on the minds of the Government. Assurances had constantly been given, not only by the Russian Government, but by the Emperor himself, on the subject of Merv^— assurances which seemed to put of the question, at all events for the present and under existing circumstances, any annexation of Merv. He fully admitted that there were qualifications of those assurances, and that the Russian Govern ment did not give up their liberty of action in regard to Merv for all time and under all circum stances. But Her Majesty’s Government w T ere not aware of any change of circumstances which might not have been anticipated’at the time when the assurances were given ; and, even if the facts had been of that nature, there was some occasion for surprise, when two Governments had for a long time been exchanging communications and expla nations upon a subject, if one of them, suddenly acted in a sense opposite to its assurances without any previous communication with the Power with whom it had carried on this friendly exchange of ideas. The Russian Ambassador stated that the assur ances of the Emperor and of the Rnssian Govern ment had been given in perfect good faith; that his Government had never the slightest intention of conquering Merv, though it might have been necessary to inflict occasional chastisements on the depredating Turkomans of that district, but that no permanent occupation was contemplated. But the state of things had entirely changed; the Chiefs had suddenly asked for the protectorate of Russia. This protectorate was a measure which would add to the heavy expenses of Russia in those • regions, but, with a view to tranquillity infit) if T . ^ * Lord Granville to Sir E. Thornton, 28th February 1884; No. 42 a. Asia; Sect. 221. | No. 42c. Asia; Sect. 221. % I. 0. Memo., Part IV., p. 17. the surrounding countries, it would be a great advantage. His Excellency alluded to the great difficulty which both Russian and English statesmen had always acknowledged to exist for a civilized Power to stop short in the extension of its territory where uncivilized tribes were its immediate neighbours, and said that there was nothing in the present extension of Russian authority which could be of disadvantage to us. Lord Granville replied that, as Baron Mohrenheim had broached the subject, he had thought it fair to let him know that the news had not been received with indifference, but that he was about to send to St. Petersburg!! the expression of the views of the British Government, and that it perhaps would be better not to anticipate that communication by further verbal discussion.* The communication in question was made in a despatch to Sir E. Thornton, dated the 29th May,f which recapitulated the various assurances given by the Russian Government in respect to Merv between 1874 and the 10th November 1884, when, in reply to an article in the French “ Agence Havas,” a note appeared in the “ Journal de St. Petersbourg ” denying the intention of Russia to go to Merv, but repudiating any pretension on the part of Persia to occupy that territory.J He then concluded:— &lt;£ The foregoing summary shows that, up to the 15th February last, the day ou which M. de Criers announced to your Excellency that the Emperor had determined to accept the allegiance of the Merv Turkomans, Her Majesty’s Government had every reason to believe that the Russian Government were pledged not to take such a step under existing circumstances, although their more recent assurances had been accompanied by qualifications which reserved to Russia liberty of action in the event of changes, not then foreseen or regarded as possible, taking place at some future time in the state of affairs. “ Her Majesty’s Government are not aware that any new cir cumstances have occurred which can be held to create a pressing necessity for the course that has been decided upon ; but, even if such were the case, it seems entirely inconsistent with the whole tenor of the mutual explanations between the two Governments that one of them should take a step which appears to be in contra diction with the assurances which have on so many occasions been received both from the Emperor and his Government, without any previous communication of their change of views. “ M. de Giers, in making the announcement to you, expressed a hope that the measures which were about to be taken would be to the advantage of the Turkoman territory and of the neighbouring States of Persia and Afghanistan., and would be viewed by Her Majesty’s Government as being adopted only in the cause of peace and good order. “ He did not state in any detail what those measures were to be and I cannot, therefore, express an opinion upon them; but you will take an early opportuity of urging His Excellency to lose no time in communicating to Her Majesty’s Government the proposals which the Russian Government may have to make to them in order to provide against the complications to which this further extension of Russian sovereignty in the direction of the frontiers of Afghanistan may give rise.” Sir E. Thornton embodied the contents of this despatch in a Note (dated the 13th March) to M. de Giers, with whom on the 12th March he had some conversation on the subject. Upon that occasion, M. de Giers said that he had 10061. B6 received a despatch from Baron Mohrenheim, in which he stated that Lord Granville had remarked that, considering all the declarations which had been previously made with regard to Merv, Her Majesty’s Government should have been informed of the intention of the Imperial Government to annex that country. But, His Excellency ob served, it was impossible to give any information beforehand, because the decision which the Turko man tribes had come to was taken suddenly, and was a surprise to the Russian authorities. Sir E. Thornton replied that the news might have been a surprise to the Imperial Government, but that it must surely have been anticipated by the authorities at Askabad, for he had observed that a force had been sent to the Tejend in the direction of Merv, and that an officer had been detached from that force, and, accompanied by an escort of Cossacks, had proceeded to Merv. It would appear that it was this officer who had induced the Mervites to offer their submission to the Russian authorities. M. de Giers admitted that the statements with regard to the force were true, but he declared that the object of the expedition w r as to demand satis faction for raids made by the Merv Turkomans into the Persian territory. The Mervites, however, hearing of the force which had reached the Tejend, and believing that it had come for the purpose of attacking and occupying Merv, became alarmed, and suddenly determined to offer their allegiance to the Czar; but M. de Giers declared that the step was entirely unforeseen by the Russian Government, and that it would have been impossible to have given to Her Majesty’s Government previous notice of its being likely to happen. Sir E. Thornton took the opportunity of asking what M. de Giers considered was the extent of the Merv territory. He replied that he supposed it would reach to the eastward to the Oxus, and to ~ J.V t I.

X As above.iirj |6«J * His real name, “ Ali Khan,” has been Russianized into “ Alikhanoff.” He has since been appointed Governor of Merv (Asia; Sect. 268'h—A. W. M. u Captain Alikhanofi’, like Lieutenant Nazaroff, and other unavowed Russian Political Agents, had on several previous occasions been employed on delicate missions in the Turkoman country. In February 1882, disguised as a trader, he succeeded in penetrating with Konshin’s caravan into Merv, and remained there for some time carefully studying its resources and local conditions, and, by active intercourse with the rulers, preparing the way for its ultimate annexation by Russia. For this work he was well qualified, being acquainted with the language of the Natives, and having been, since 1873, employed on military service in Central Asia and in the Caucasus. Thus he took part in the Khiva campaign when he was wounded ; he subsequently also accompanied General Lomakin in his disastrous campaign of 1879, having for its object the subjugation of the Akhal-Teke country. In the military operations under General Skoboleff, in 1880-81, he was also actively engaged. “ In addition to his knowledge of Oriental languages, and the experience of Asiatic affairs gained by him in the course of his military career, he possessed, as a Political Agent among the Turkomans, the special qualifications of being a Mussulman and a Native of the Caucasus,* and, therefore, acquainted with the manners, customs, and mode of thought of Orientals, and the most effective way of dealing with them. “ Enjoying all these advantages of birth, creed, training, and experience, no fitter emissary than Alikhanoff could have been employed by the Russian Government for completing, in a political sense, the military achievement of the late General Skoboleff. We according find him dispatched to Merv during the course of last January, and the result of his mission now appears in the so-called voluntary acknowledgment of Russian supremacy by the Turkomans of Merv, a step which, in every probability, will be followed by the submission to Russia of all the hitherto independent Turkoman tribes. “ According to the ‘ Svet ’ newspaper, which is edited by Colonel Komaroff, brother of the General of that name, who holds chief command in the Trans-Caspian region, Alikhanoff, bearing a letter from General Komaroff, proceeded to Merv in January last, and on arrival at that place took up his quarters in the house of Yusuf Khan, a youth of 17 years, and brother of Mahmud- Kuli-Khan, Commander of the Akhal-Tekes against Skoboleff, and who, on the occasion of his visit to Moscow at the coronation of the Emperor, received from His Imperial Majesty the rank of Major. It was at the house of this Yusuf Khan that all the negotiations were carried on for the establishment of Russian rule. These preliminaries arranged, Alikhanoff conducted the Khans of Merv, together with a numerous deputation of Elders from the different tribes, to Kolibent, on the Tejend River, about 90 miles distant, and situated on the new Russian frontier, where a detachment of Cossacks and artillery had been stationed a short time previously for the alleged purpose of restraining by means of a military demonstration the renewed raids of the Mervee robber bands. “ On reaching the Russian detachment the Mervees presented to Colonel Muratoff, the officer in command, a petition drawn up on a large sheet of parchment in the Tartar language, and bearing the signatures of the Khans and Elders, praying His Imperial Majesty to incorporate the Merv territory with his dominions. “ Colonel Muratoff' received the petition, and soon after escorted the deputation to Askabad, where, on the 31st January (12th February) last, in the presence of General Komaroff, Major- General Meyer, chief of his staff, and Colonels Geintz, Lebedovitch, Nichitz, Nevtonoff, Khrajanofsky, and other military and civil functionaries, the Khans and deputies of the Merv tribes solemnly swore allegiance to the Emperor of Russia, the ceremony being preceded by an address made to them by General Komaroff, in which he warmly welcomed them as future subjects of His Majesty, and urged them strictly to observe the oath of fidelity they were about to make. “Colonel Muratoff has already arrived at St. Petersburg as the bearer of the formal act of submission, and will in due course receive some mark of Imperial favour for his services in connection with the surrender by the Mervees of their political independence. Alikhauoff has already been recompensed for his successful activity in the matter. The Gazette of the 24th February (7th March) 1884 announced that he had been restored to the rank of Major, of which he was deprived some years ago by court-martial for a breach of discipline. Such are some of the particulars now12 from being taken at a moment when Her Majesty s Government were embarrassed by the affairs of the Soudan. But Baron Mobrenheim declared that this result, although it might have been expected in the more or less distant future, had been a real sur prise to the Russian Government, who had also found themselves in the presence of an acknow ledged fact without being able either to alter it or explain its cause. As regarded the event itself, his Excellency said that the *Russian Government were glad to observe the view taken of it by Her Majesty’s Government, the Opposition, and the public. It led them to hope that the matter would not raise any serious difficulty between the two Governments. They had formed the same conclusion from the Note addressed to M. de Giers, which would be examined in the most impartial and conciliatory spirit possible. His Excellency concluded by saying that, in the opinion of M. de Giers, the best course to pursue would be for the two Governments to show the world that they were resolved to abandon their ancient policy of mistrust and antagonism in favour of one of confidence, friendship, and loyal co operation. If England would adopted this line of conduct, Russia would glady follow her example. Lord Granville told Baron Mohrenheim that he would not fail to inform his colleagues of the explanation which M. de Giers had authorized his Excellency to give as to the reasons why a measure which had seemed obligatory to the Russian Government had not been previously made known to Her Majesty’s Government, wdth whom for so long a time communications had been passing on the subject of Merv. He added that he w r as glad to learn the spirit in which the Russian Government had received the communication addressed to them through Sir E. Thornton, and their desire to come to an under standing with Her Majesty’s Government in con sequence of the altered circumstances of the case. It would be his duty also to enter upon such dis cussions with perfect frankness, and a desire to arrive at a solution honourable and satisfactory to both countries.* Subsequently, Baron Mohrenheim supplemented the explanations of his Government by a Memo randum, in which he referred to Mons. de Giers’ reply to Sir E. Thornton’s Note of the 12th March, and expressed the hope that Her Majesty’s Govern ment would have appreciated its friendly nature. Its guiding principles were confidence and reci procity, w T hich were indispensable to any real and durable understanding, and without which no good could be expected or attained. Whilst deprecating a polemical discussion of the past, His Excellency stated that he believed himself to be fully autho rized to declare that, if any other Government but * Lord GranviUe to Sir E. Thornton, 1st April 1884; No. 73 a. Asia; Sect. 232,ti£\ uX ' 13 that of Mr. Gladstone had been in office, the Russian Government would have formally declined to discuss the matter at all. He observed that British action in Afghanistan, Khelat, Beloochistan, and Seistan had never formed the sabject of inquiry on the part of Russia, who had never asked what the intentions of England might or might not be on her frontiers. Russia had the right to claim the same consideration where her frontiers were concerned, and she would have replied in that sense to any other Government; but, out of regard for Her Majesty’s present advisers, she thought it desirable to establish the loyalty of her acts, and especially the absence of all ill will in her pro- Russian Government ultimately brought itself was that, the question having been settled “ by the “ force of circumstances,” the relations between England and Russia in Central Asia could not fail to be improved, as they would become “ simpler, “ easier, and less exposed to jealousies and sus- “ picions,” it being no longer necessary for Her Majesty’s Government to ask for explanations on delicate points, while the Government of Russia would not be called upon “ to give assurances, “ accompanied by unavoidable reservations, with ‘ £ regard to a bugbear which darkened the after the formal act of submission at Askabad, there is an absence of precise information. the chief men of Merv, some 25 in number, who, with their followers, numbered nearly a hundred persons, returned to Merv from Askabad on the 10th March, having received very handsome presents. On the 12th idem. Lieutenant Maksud Alikhanoff arrived at Merv with 100 Akhal sowars, and put up in the house of Abdul Sardar, about four miles from Merv, in order to arrange for the coming of the General. On the 14th March General Komaroff arrived from Askabad with two guns and about 1,000 soldiers ; he stayed the night about 16 miles from Kala Koushid Khan. Many Khans and people went out to him. A portion of the people of Merv were hostile to the Russians, and called upon Baba Khan and Kajar Khan to lead them. Baba Khan said &lt;£ I have a paper from the Emperor promising ££ that Russian troops shall not occupy Merv for ££ 20 years.” Baba Khan and Kajar Khan went out to the Russians, and Baba Khan showed the General a paper from the Emperor. The General said to Baba Khan, ££ Surely it is not you, the son ££ of the great Koushid Khan, who have been f£ reduced to poverty by the Turcomans, who should ££ resist us.

Thornton of what had passed was, that General Komarod had gone to Merv with a small escort, accompanied by a M. Teharikoff, an employe of the Russian foreign Office, the object of his journey being to make inquiries, so as to form an opinion and report to his Government what measures it would be expedient to take for the future government of the country. Erom M. Tcharikoff His Excellency had heard that, the General had been extremely well received by the Mervites, and that all the different tribes were ready to swear allegiance to the Emperor, but that on their way to Merv they had been slightly molested by Saryk Turcomans, who, it was said, were influenced by the Afghans.* Subsequently M. de Giers admitted that there had been some little trouble on General Komaroff* s arrival at Merv, or rather before he actually entered the place. He said that the General had with him an escort of 200 men, that on approaching Merv they were surrounded by a multitude of armed Turkomans, who were incited to resist their advance by an Afghan whose name he could not recall. Some shots were fired by these men, when the Russian escort was also obliged to fire. One Rus sian was w r ounded, and several of the Turkomans were killed. The ringleaders were arrested, but the Afghan escaped for the moment; he was, how ever, pursued and captured. The resistance having been crushed, General Komaroff entered the Settlement, was exceedingly well received, at once established a court of justice, and was considering what steps should be taken for the future government of the Merv Turkomans and of their territory. M. de Giers expressed his hope that peace and order would soon be established in those regions.f The so-called Afghan above mentioned was after wards stated to be a certain “ Siah-posh Dervish,” whose name has figured largely in the reports from the Persian frontier during the last year. Colonel Stewart heard that he was a son of the Amir of Bokhara.J Mons. de Giers informed Sir E. Thornton that documents found upon him proved him to be an agent of Ayub Khan, and claimed that, in effecting his capture and detaining him in con finement, the Russian authorities had rendered a service to the Amir of Afghanistan.§ In the course of the month of May, Prince * From Sir E.

He added that in former times the Persian authorities were so apprehensive of the incursions threatened by the Merv Turko mans, that they did not venture to deprive them of water which they required; hut that since they had been to a certain extent guaranteed from these raids by the neighbourhood of the Russian forces, they had not hesitated to cut off the water of which f From -Sir E.

In a despatch dated the 23rd May, * Mr. Thomson reported more fully what had passed at Teheran in the matter, as follows :— “ Having learned from a newspaper telegram lately received here that a statement had been published in the ‘ Tiflis Gazette,’ to the effect that the Persian Government had ceded Sarakhs to Russia, I caused inquiry to be made on the subject of the. Minister for Foreign Affairs. His Excellency assured me that no com munication had been made to the Persian Government by Russia regarding Sarakhs, and that if any proposal for its cession to that Power should hereafter bo made, it would most certainly be rejected by the Shah. I suggested to the Nasser-el-MuIk 'that, possibly, it was not the Persian town of Sarakhs that had been referred to, and that it might have been intended by the statement published in the ‘ Tiflis Gazette ’ to convey the announcement that the Sarakhs territory on the right bank of the Tejend, which includes the position known as Old Sarakhs, had passed into Russia’s possession. This appeared to me the more probable, because I had heard that the Russian General who had lately visited that locality, accompanied by several of the Merv Chiefs, had given notice to the Persian cultivators of the lands on the right bank of the river that they might secure their crops for this year, but that they would not be permitted to occupy these lands after the present season. “ On the following day I received a private message from the Shah, expressing great uneasiness at the reported cession of Sarakhs, to which the Russians had given-currency, and at the rumours which had reached him direct from that place. His Majesty said that New Sarakhs, on this side of the Tejend, and Old Sarakhs, on the other bank of the river, formed one district, and indisputably belonged to Persia. New Sarakhs was a place of no importance. It had been built in an ill-selected position, where there was no proper supply of water, and the land was consequently uncultivable. The inhabitants were dependent for their food on the lands on the opposite bank of the river, and without these New Sarakhs would be almost valueless to Persia. His Majesty said that he could not understand, under those circumstances, how Russia could lay claim to any portion of the Sarakhs district, and he hoped that this would not be attempted. In the event, how ever, of such a claim being put forward, he would do all in his power to maintain his right to the whole of the Sarakhs territory on both banks of the Tejend. “ The Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed me that the Persian Representative at St. Petersburgh has been instructed to ask for an explanation respecting the publication in the Tiflis official Gazette of an unfounded statement as to the cession of Sarakhs by Persia. The report has since, however, been contradicted by the St. Petersburgh papers, and the Persian Government does not now consider it expedient to raise the question of her right to the Old Sarakhs lands by entering upon a discussion on the subject at the present moment with the Russian Minister here. It is intended, however, to ascertain the views of Russia in that quarter, by giving orders to the frontier officials in Khorassan to make preparations at once for recultivating the soil, and for erecting habitations for the Persian peasants who now occupy and cultivate the lands.” f No. 94. Asia; Sect. 268. J Asia; Sect. 257. In a further despatch dated the 16th June,f in amplification of a telegram of the previous day4' Mr. Thomson wrote that the question of the probable occupation by Russia of the lands adjacent to the old fort of Sarakhs, situated on the right bank of the Tejend, continued to cause much anxiety to the Shah and his Ministers. No positive statement had yet been made by the Russian Minister of its being the intention of his Govern- 10061. E18 Turkomans of Mery. The objection raised by the Russian Minister was met by the Persian Govern ment with the assertion that all the Sarakhs lands, whether on the right or the left bank of the river, were unquestionably Persian territory, and that the Turkomans who settled there from time to time had done so with the permission of the Persian authorities, to whom they paid tithes. The Persian Government also affirmed that they had repeatedly expelled the Turkomans from the Sarakhs lands when they had reason to be dissatisfied with their presence there. Mr Thomson added:— “ A reference to the following despatches from this Legation, No. 18G, of the 28th November 1877, No. 90, of the 17th April 1880, and No. 178, of the 8th August 1880, will show that the statements made by the Persian Government in this matter are borne out by the fact that, when the Merv Chiefs were negotiating for the submission of their tribe to Persia, one of the conditions thet they proposed was that they should be allowed to occupy the district of Sarakhs, old Sarakhs being specially mentioned, and that the Persian Government would not agree to the proposal, the late Hissam-es-Sultaneh, who was consulted in this matter, having considered it inadvisable that they should be allowed to do so. “ The Russian Minister has been informed that the Persian Government consider their right to the whole of the Sarakhs territory indisputable, and they will therefore continue to allow their subjects to occupy and cultivate the lands on the right bank of the Tejend which form part of the Sarakhs district. Communi cations between the Persian Government and the Russian Legation on this subject have, however, now been suspended, probably pending a reference to St. Petersburgh. “ Persian remonstrances, even if followed by a protest which I understand the Shah is at present not disinclined to make, are not likely to have much weight with the Russian Government in determining their action with regard to Sarakhs, but it is possible that the feeling of dissatisfaction which has been produced here by these proceedings may leave an unfavourable impression on the Shah’s mind which will not readily be effaced.” On the 18th June, Mr. Thomson reported the receipt of intelligence from Meshed that 300 Russian horse had taken possession of Hissari- Khoushid on the old Sarakhs side of the river, having ejected the Persian guards from the place.* * Asia ; Sect. 257. The place is called ihe Russian force was accompanied by Major “Kaleh Khoushid” in the' detailed re- Alikhanoff, the Governor of Merv. Upon news of P orts -—A. W. M. his arrival, the Governor of Sarakhs sent out a small body or matchlock men to ask what was his intention. He, in reply, asked what the Persians wanted, and, on being told that they had come to garrison Kaleh Khoushid, informed them that they had nothing to do with the rifjht bank of T' KV I J L) ,1 1 J 1 J a V— ' the Heri-Rud, and that no garrison was wanted.L + » On the 21st June, Mr. Thomson telegraphed with 1884. t Meshed Agent’s Report, 21st June reference to this matter: Russian troops, has addressed further remons^e to Zsial19 * Home ; No. 573. Asia; Sect. 263, f Home ; Nos. 598 and 612. Minister here, who states that his Government cannot recognize claims of Persia to any territory on right bank of river. Minister for Foreign Affairs has shown me draft of letter he proposes to write in reply, in which he denounces present action of Russia as unfriendly, and reasserts Persian claim to entire district. He states that, before new fort was built, only one Sarakhs, the district on the right bank of river, was known, that it was recog nized by all as Persian territory, and that Persian claim to district had never been questioned even by Turkomans. With regard to Russian statement that the district belongs to Merv Turkomans, attention is called to fact that the latter twice during recent years applied to Persia for permission to settle there, which was refused. Minister for Foreign Affairs also cites official promise lately by Russian Charge d’Affaires that territory claim should be investi gated, which has not been done. “ Persian Government is anxious to know whether Persian remonstrances, and formal protest if made, would be supported by Her Majesty’s Government at St. Petersburgh.” In a telegram dated the 24th June,* the Viceroy of India expressed the opinion of the Indian Government that the Persian remonstrance should he supported, the matter being at least left for investigation by the Boundary Commission; the retention of the Old Sarakhs district by Persia would interrupt direct communications between Akhal and Herat territory, and, conjointly with an Afghan occupation of Panjdeh, would prevent Bussia occupying any part of the Heri-Bud valley; it was certain that more than fifty years ago Persia drove the Salors out of Old Sarakhs, and since then the Turkomans who occupied the lands had done so by Persian permission. New Sarakhs depended on the Old Sarakhs district for supplies, and was useless by itself. On the 3rd July, after reference to this Office, and with Lord Kimberley’s concurrence, the fol lowing answer was sent to Mr. Thomson’s telegram of the 21st June :—f “ Inform Persian Government confidentially, and with friendly expressions, that it will probably be for their advantage to exhaust every means of arriving at an understanding with Russia before appealing to Her Majesty’s Government for support; but if, notwithstanding Shah’s remonstrances, the Russian Government insist on appropriating territory which can be shown to have been under Persian rule at a recent date, Her Majesty’s Government will be ready to consider any application which Shah may make for their good offices at St. Petersburgh.” I Asia; Sect. 266. § On the left bank of the Heri-Rud, about 20 miles south of Pul-i-Khatun.—A. W. M. || Memorandum, 17th July 1884. Home; No. 678. Mr. Thomson replied on the 8th July:—J “ Have informed Persian Government as instructed in your Lordship’s telegram of 3rd instant. Since mine of 21st June Minister for Foreign Affairs has continued unavailing official correspondence with Russian Minister, who maintains that Persia undertaking not to interfere with I urkomans on right bank of Tejend includes territory which they have occupied. Shah will probably desist from claim when he sees that Russians are determined to retain possession, but His Majesty has found additional cause for disquietude in report received yesterday that Russians mean to take over all Salor families from Zoorahad§ and left bank of river.” With reference to the concluding paragraph of this telegram, Mr. Condie Stephen, Second Secretary at Teheran, at present in this country, wrote as follows:—1| “ I would venture to suggest that it might be desirable to urge the Shah to intimate to the Chief of the Salors that he ann his followers are not obliged to remain at Zoorabad, but are at liberty! 111 20 to emigrate to Merv or elsewhere in the Turkoman country in case they prefer to do so. “ I would likewise point out that unless timely steps are taken to counteract the plans Russia evidently contemplates adopting with regard to the Heri-Rud districts, she will soon have succeeded in obtaining a footing on the left bank of the river, south of Pul-i- Khatun, with a view to her further advance southward in the direction of Seistan in the event of a definite delimitation of the northern frontier of Afghanistan preventing her pushing southward along the right bank. “ It is of the greatest importance that the Turkoman element should, if possible, be entirely eliminated from Afghanistan and the Persian bank of the Heri-Rud, for, should portions of Turkoman tribes remain in Persiait or Afghan territory, an excuse would soon be found by Russia for interfering with them in some way or another, and an inlet be thus afforded for intrigues. &lt;{ In the event of the Salor Turkomans of Zoorabad showing signs of tendering their submission to Russia, it would be most desirable that they should at once be given to understand that they cannot remain at Zoorabad or in Persian territory.” Mr. Stephen also recommended that if Mr. Finn, British Consul at Resht, who had been deputed to the Perso-Afghan frontier during Colonel Stewart’s absence on leave, was at Meshed he should he ordered at once to Zoorabad to keep watch on the intrigues and movements of Russian agents in that neighbourhood. On the 17th July, Malkom Khan had a con versation with Lord Granville on the subject of Russian proceedings at Sarakhs. The Shah, had, he said, desired him to remind Lord Granville that when His Majesty was in England fin 1873) an assurance had been given him that the integrity of Persia would be respected by England and Russia, and that, as long as Persia gave no cause of complaint, that engagement between England and Russia would hold good.* Now, however, although Persia had given no cause of complaint, Russia, by force, was taking possession of the greater.part of Sarakhs. Maikom Khan said that the Shah had expressed his surprise at the answer which had been sent to Teheran on this matter, and he asked whether, if Russia were to take possession by force of Asterahad of all Khorassan, of the provinces on the shore of the Caspian, and of Azerbijan, the same replv would be given. What, in that case, would be the value of the assurances which the Shah had received m England, and which had been given on behalf of a powerful country. Lord Granville told Malkom Khan that he would look at the papers, and resume the conversation on a later day. , ^ xciamu minister said that he observed 1 tne tone of the instructions he had received, the Shah was much irritated at the proceeding t ic Russians, and he expressed his hope that J Granville s answer would be categorical t letter (18th July) J having been received f ye Foreign Office requesting the opinion of Secretary of State for India as to the lawn, which should be held to Malcom Khan when conversation was resumed, and also as to the pedwncy of acting upon Mr. Stephen’s suggest] * bor a full account of this correspond ence see Sir O. Burne’s Note on “ Persia ” (1st December 1879), pp. 75 to 89. The document particularly referred to by Malkom Khan is believed to be the following letter from Lord Granville to the Sadr Azim, dated 2nd July 1873, in reply to one requesting to be informed what had passed between England and Russia in regard to main tenance of the integrity of Persia : — exists by which the two countries mutually agree to respect the integrity of Persia, yet in the year 1834 an understanding was anived at between the two Governments on the occasion of the nomination of Mahomed Mirza as successor to the throne of Persia. JTlntt understanding was based on the sincere desire of the two Governments to maintain not only the internal tranquillity, but also the independence and integrity of Persia and in the year 1838 Count Nesselrode ad verted to the agreement entered info by the two Governments as still subsisting in full force, as it was also acknowledged to do bv Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. “ Her Majesty’s Government, as they recognize for themselves the principles which guided the general policy of Great Britain and Russia in favour of the independence and integrity of Persia in the year 1834 have reason to believe, from information which they have received from Lord Loftus tier Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Peters burg, that the Russian Government refer with satisfaction to the mutual assurances 1838 WerG ma&lt;3e ° n tliG sub J ect in 1834 and “ Her Majesty’s Government consider that the best mode of confirming both Powers in those sentiments is that Persia, -while steadily maintaining her rights as an in- « open dent 1 ower, should studiously fulfil in a respects her treaty engagement with eacn and so ensure the continuance of the friendship which both Powers, even for their own interests, should desire to maintain with i i ( -k ranville to Mr. Thomson 17th July 1884, No. 88. 1 Home ; No. 678.J ;&lt;(&gt; 21 in regard to the Turkomans at Zoorabad, and the deputation of Mr. Finn to that place, Mr. Godley replied (19th July) :— “ Lord Kimberley does not think that anything can be added to the answer already given to the Persian Government, as regards Sarakhs. It appears, however, to His Lordship, to be of great importance that; Russia should not encroach on Persian territory south of that place, and he would suggest that assur ances should be given to Malkom Khan as to the active interest Her Majesty’s Government take in the maintenance of the Shah’s authority in the districts of Khorassan bordering on Afghanistan. “ The Shah should, in Lord Kimberley’s opinion, be urged to lose no time in placing trustworthy officers in charge of those districts, and to use every effort to prevent the Russians from obtaining an influence over the population through the Turkoman tribes. “ His Lordship entirely agrees in the recommendation of Mr. Stephen respecting the Turkomans at Zoorabad, and considers it, on every account, desirable that they should not remain on Persian territory, where it appears they have only settled within the last two years. He also thinks it advisable that Mr. Finn should be sent to Zoorabad.” When, on the 19th July, the Persian Minister again called at the Foreign Office, Lord Granville reminded him that the Persian Government had been repeatedly warned (in 1878 and 1879) of the result likely to follow' the complaisant attitude maintained by them in regard to the advances of Russia. They had refused an offer made by the British Government at that time to support their right to Knri-kala.* Later, when they had been urged to establish their authority in the neigh bourhood of the Tejend, and had been offered a subsidy to assist them in so doing, they had Memo., nth April 1882, declined' the offer. f The time had now r passed when we could interfere with any effect in regard to the frontier north of Sarakhs. With regard to the frontier south of that point, he said that Her Majesty’s Government took an active interest in preventing Russian encroachment on the left, bank of the Heri-Rud. They therefore advised the Shah to use every effort to strengthen his position in that quarter, and with that view recom mended him to take immediate steps to intimate to the Chief of the Salor tribe of Turkomans that he and his followers were not obliged to remain at Zoorabad, but were at liberty to emigrate to Merv or elsewhere in the Turkoman territory in case they preferred to do so. In the event of the Salor Turkomans showing signs of a disposition to tender their submission to Russia, they should at once be given to understand that they could not be allowed to remain at Zoorabad or in Persian territory. Lord Granville added that he proposed to instruct Mr. Finn, who had been sent to Meshed, to proceed to Zoorabad, in order to watch what was taking place. Malcom Khan observed that what Lord Granville had said might be good advice, but that it was not a reply to the question which he had been instructed to put, viz., what course Her Majesty’s Government would take if Russia were to lay claim to the whole 10061 . &amp; * See I.

Maleom Khan said that he hoped the memo randum would be worded as strongly as ciicum- stances would admit, as otherwise the Shah would be greatly discouraged, and would be impelled to throw himself completely into the hands of Russia.* So far as is known in this Office nothing more has passed on the subject. Prom a despatch just received from Mr. Thomson,! however, the defec tion from Persia of the Salor Turkomans residing at Zoorabad appears to be an accomplished fact. These Turkomans were permitted some years ago to establish themselves at that place, as the Shah was desirous of restoring to cultivation the adjacent lands, then deserted, but a declaration in writing was first taken from them to the effect that they would consider’ themselves Persian subjects. But the fact of other Salor Turkomans residing on the right bank of the Ileri-Itud having accepted Russian allegiance seems to have induced them to depart from their engagements and abandon their lands and dwellings. According to reports from Meshed they proceeded to Kaleh Khoushid immediately on Alikhanoffs arrival there, declared for Russian subjection, were warmly welcomed, and returned to Pul-i-Khatun, where, a few days later, upon a demand from them for protection against the Persians, 50 Cossacks were sent and remained. The number of the Salors who have gone over to the Russians is stated at 3,000 families, only their Chief, Mengeli Khan, with his own immediate followers, some 10 or 12 families, having remained in Persia. The Governor of Sarakhs having sent to Alikhanoff to inquire, in the first place, what right he had to come to Kaleh Khoushid, and what was his business there, and, secondly, why he had seduced away the Salor Turkomans who were Persian subjects, the Russian replied that he was acting under in structions from his Government in going to Kaleh Khoushid, and as to the Salors, they were formerly settled on what was now Russian soil which they had only left on account of local feuds; he had not seduced them away; they had come of their own accord, and it was the practice that a Govern ment should afford protection to all those who sought an asylum on its territory; whatever the Govei nor of Sarakhs had to say had better be made known to the Shah, so that he might communicate with the Emperor of Russia on the subject. Alikhanoff added the significant statement that two messengers had already come to him from the Sank Turkomans of Panjdeh* to ask for Russian protection, but that, pending a reference to the Emperor, he had taken no steps in the matter. * Lord Granville to Mr. Thomson, 19th July 1884, No. 89.

The Amir has lately appoined Aminulla Khan, son of Khan Aga Jamshidi (put to death by Ayub Khan in 1880) to be Governor of the district, but up to the latter part of June he had not arrived at his post, having stopped on the Upper Murghab. This, according to the Meshed Agent’s Herat correspondent, is ascribed to the great influence exerted by the Russians over the Sariks of Panjdeh by means of tbeir brethren at Yolatan, though the Panjdeh people still profess to be loyal subjects of Afghanistan. See letter from Meshed Agent, 5th July lb84, sent to Viceroy ° b &gt;' Mr. Thomson, 18th July.A. A. W. M. JIt only remains to notice briefly what has been going on in the Ateks of Deregez and Kelat, to the west of the Tejend, while the absorption of the Turkoman country to the east of the river has been in progress. In that quarter, it appears that the question of the water supply for irrigation is of great importance to the inhabitants, and that, disputes having arisen, on the subject between the Persian and Turkoman settlers, Commissioners were appointed last winter by the Russian and Persian Governments to settle them. On the 5th March, the Russian Minister at Teheran informed Mr. Thomson that Colonel Karavaieff, the Russian Commissioner, had been unable to obtain a satisfactory solution of the question, and that he had therefore returned to Askabad pending further proceedings. According to M. Melnikoff’s statement, the Persian population in the Ateks had appropriated most of the streams belonging to the Turkoman inhabitants, when the latter were compelled temporarily to abandon their lands after the fall of Geuk-Tepe, and the Russian authorities were now insisting upon the water which was then diverted from the Turkoman villages being restored to its rightful owners. M. Melnikoff further stated that all the Turkomans dwelling in the Ateks of Dereghez and Kelat were Russian subjects, but he admitted that there were several villages in those districts which, like Lutfabad, undoubtedly belonged to Persia, their inhabitants being recognized as Persian subjects. Mr. Thomson having remarked that this arrangement would place the Ateks under the joint protectorate of Russia and Persia, and asked if any agreement had been made or negotiations taken place with the Persian Government respecting the Turkoman villages in that region and the line of frontier in the Kelat and Dereghez districts, M. Melnikoff replied that the only question which Colonel Karavaieff had been authorized to discuss was that of the partition of the streams in the Atek of Dereghez. No negotiations had yet taken place with the Persian Government respecting the boundary line on that part of the Khorassan frontier, nor had the necessary maps and surveys yet been made. He was of opinion, however, now that Merv had bhcome Russian territory, that the moment had arrived for the delimitation of the frontier through the Atek country. As to this, however, Mr. Thomson, in reporting to Lord Granville,* observed :— “ It seems to me move probable that the frontier question will be left unsettled for the present. The right of Russia to the Turkoman villages in the Ateks is not contested, and no objection is raised to the passage of her troops through the districts between Askabad and the Tejend. It is not unlikely, therefore, that the Russians will defer negotiations on the subject of the line of boundary until the entire population in the Atek region has been brought completely under their influence. The Persian as well as the Turkoman population will then declare themselves Russian subjects, and refuse longer to give their allegiance to Persia. This 10061 .

This claim to the whole o the water was looked upon as most unjust by t le Persians. The people of Kelat cultivated very little land within the hitis, all their best lands being on the skirt of them. These were now all claimed by Russia. He was informed on very good authority that the exodus from Kelat, Dereghez, and all the border districts of Khorassan was very great, and had exceeded 20,000 people. The Russians offered these people rich lands which formerly belonged, perhaps, to the very individuals, and an* almost unlimited supply of water, and for the present no taxes whatever to pay ; under these . circumstances the border districts of Khorassan, which were already very sparely populated, would become almost depopulated, and the natural fortress of Kelat deserted by most of its inhabitants, would fall an easy prey to Russia if she should ever wish to possess it. With reference to Colonel Stewart’s report, Mr. Thomson wrote :—+ “ Colonel Stewart refers therein to Colonel Karavaieif as the Russian Commissioner for the demarcation of the Kelat boundary. I understand, however, that the formal delimitation of that pai’t of the frontier has not yet been commenced. The Russian Minister has stated to me that the only question which Colonel Karavaieff has been authorized to discuss on the Dereghez and Kelat border is that of the partition of the streams flowing into the Ateks ; and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to whom I spoke on the subject yesterday, confirmed this statement by in forming me that no proposals had yet been made by Russia for the delimitation of the boundary to the east of Baba Dormaz. His Excellency again assured me that when any communication was made to the Persian Government on that subject he would at once acquaint me with the fact, and keep me informed of the negotiations that might then ensue. The Russians have already claimed all the Turkomans residing in the Ateks as their subjects, and have for some time exercised almost complete jurisdiction over the whole of that region, with out protest or remonstrance on the part of Persia. By now claiming the control of all the streams flowing into the Ateks they will speedily obtain the allegiance of the rest of the inhabitants, hitherto regarded as Persian subjects, who will be compelled to place themselves under Russian protection in order to procure the * Asia ; Sect. 260. f No. 71, dated 13th May 1884. Asia; Sect. 260.supply of water necessary for the irrigation of their fields. When this result has been obtained, the question of the formal delimitation of the frontier will probably be brought forward by the Russian Legation at Teheran. Meanwhile, as a preliminary measure, the Russian Commissioner is using every effort to deprive the Persian authorities of all control over the water supply on the Dereghez and Kelat border. “ The telegrams lately received by the Persian Government from their Commissioner, Suleiman Khan, which complain in very strong terms of the unfriendly proceedings of the Russians in this matter, appear to have produced a very unfavourable impres sion upon the Shah and his Ministers. I gather, indeed, from recent conversations with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the Persian Government now feel considerable uneasiness at the prospect of their having to define the boundary line on that part of the Khorassan frontier themselves with the Russians, and that they would gladly welcome the presence of an English Delegate to take part, in the negotiations, though they fear to incur the displeasure and resentment of Russia by making such a proposal to Her Majesty’s Government.” * No. 84, dated 12th June 1884.

The memorandum gives the Russian response, describing the annexation as merely an act of local administration without political pre-meditation on the part of Russia, who continue to seek co-operation and friendly relations with the British Government.The memorandum goes on to describe British concerns and Russian denials that they next intended to annexe Sarakhs on the Persian border, and, upon the arrival of Russian troops at Sarakhs and in other parts of Khorassan, Persian protests to the Russian Government.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Russian Empire</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Khorasan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sarakhs</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Merv</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military occupation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00007e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
