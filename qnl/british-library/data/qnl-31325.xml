The letter speaks for itself. in, Political Agent, Kuwait.COPY &amp; From, C.Abdul Ifcadir, c/o Mr. Abdulla Mila Salih. Kuwait, 4th. November 19 36. To H.B.M’s Political Agent Kuwa i t. Honoured Sir, I most respectfully beg to submit that one Abdul Husain Hyderabadi, a merchant in Bahrain owed me a sum of Rs.60/- (Sixty) on account of one parcel of articles I got for him from India on 4-6-1935, when I was in Bahrain. After repeated requests and warnings he een t me here a sum of Rs.20/- (Twenty) in the month of June 1936, promising that he would pay the balance soon. Since then I have been requesting him for the payment of tha balance of Rs.40/- but to no purpose. So I sent a registered notice to him on 2-9-36, warning him of the legal proceedings if he would fail to pay the balance within 15 days, on receipt of the above notice, because I have been recievinf very pressing letters from the owner of the articles for immediate settlement of his account which was long outstanding. In reply to my Registered Notice he wrote to me that the balance would be sent as soon as possible, but I regret to say that I hardly realized his promise although two months elapsed since then. Now I am fully convinced that I will never realize the amount due to me by him unless I aproach the Proper Authority for recovery of the same. I therefore most respectfully request your honour to kindly do the needful in the matter and recover the said amount from him, for which I will be most grateful for your honour. I beg to remain, Honoured ^ir , Your most obedient servant, Sd. C.A.Kf dir.No. ~B/3 67 Political Agency, Baurain, tHe 1st December 193b. To The ’'olitical Agent, Kuwait.

Ahdul Iinsain end Ahmad Hyderabad^ admit the claim of Abdul Kadir agaimjt them but it is not possible to realise the claim in full just now owing to the fact that they had once a robbery in their house and twice their shop caught fire. All the Bahr&lt;‘ in merchants have shown them grace by not pressing any claims until 2 years when only 5 per cent of the total claim will be recoverable. One merchant has accepted the/innt' iMllta of Is. 2/- In settlement of his claim. 3, it is therefore suggested that the creditor : ay v indly o asked to accept a monthly instalment of Hs*2/- till hio claim is fir sally settled.

The applicant states in his „bove letter that^in order to save the boat, the goods and the lives of the crew, he made an arrangement with the Manan*ah and J^abasah of Qatar to salve the goods and take half of whatever is saved. The goods were not Drought to Bahrain but were loft in the village of Abul Dhaluf until the applicant makes an arrangement to take them away. Prom the applicant’s own letter there seems to be no ground for a complaint against the e.atar people. Besides,the arrangement was made outside Bahrain and I do not think we can do anything to help the man in recovering all the goods, for he is only entitled for half.
