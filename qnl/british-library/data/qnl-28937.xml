On the 9th January I visited Tamb Island. I understand there are some five houses of Persians on the island and fifteen of Arabs. 2. I saw some of the Persians who stated (a) that about a year ago the son of the Shaikh of Ras al Khaima came to the Island and took away his father*s flag (b) that at the same time he recovered Rs.40/~ tribute from them. They stated that they expected another, visit from the Shaikh’s men shortly and a demand for a further sum of Rs.40/- as annual tribute. They stated they could not possibly afford much a large sum and asked me whether they had to pay it. In the absence of any information on the subject all I could say was that I would make enquiries. 3. With regard to (a) will you please enquire from the Shaikh of Ras al Khaima whether he has in fact removed his flag and if so why. Although the Persian Government are unlikely to adopt an aggressive attitude in present circumstances, it is desirable that the Shaikh should continue to assert his claim. If therefore he has removed his flag he should be asked to send it back again. I understand it is the custom of the islanders to hoist it whenever a ship visits the island. It is of course possible that they have made away with it themselves in order to be in a better p&amp;x posi- *• tion to deny the Shaikh’s overlordship and to refuse to pay tribute. They certainly appeared rather sheep-faced and as if they had something on their consciences when I talked with them. 4. With regard to (b) the islanders state that the Shaikh never demanded tribute before last year. Is this true ? If we / insistinsist on the Shaikh asserting his rights over the island we can hardly forbid him to exact tribute, though in view of the poverty of the islanders the sum should be little more than a nominal one. The correct answer, however, to the islanders probably is 'You are the subjects of the Shaikh and you must render to him whatever is due to him • 5* I may be visiting the island again in April if as I hope to do another trip to Muscat in the 'Nearchus* then and I should be grateful if before then you could let me know the facts so far as you may be able to ascertain them and also let me have any comments or suggestions you may wish to make. sd.

The mere fact that enquiries have been made about the flag and the levy of excessive tribute will probably be sufficient to ensure that the Shaikh is, in future, more careful about the former and more considerate about the latter* I will not, therefore, unless you instruct me to the contrary, pursue the matter further with the Shaikh* 5. As to the islanders, a reply to the effect that their increased 'tribute 1 * included a penalty for smuggling would not be untrue and might prove salutary* Yours sincerely, sd. E.B.Wakefield.

The Shaikh ^denies that either he or his son have ever removed his flag from the Island of Tunb. He admits the importance of continuing to assert his claim to the Island but states that he does not get enough income from it even to pay for the expense of employing a special man whose duty would be to look after the hoisting of the flag. This duty, he says, has been entrusted to one of the Islanders by him and is generally performed. The Shaikh is always at pains to see that a flag is kept on the Island as soon as he learns that a new one is needed. My impression was that the flag-hoisting is performed with the ordinary degree of care given to any routine duty in these parts. I impressed upon the Shaikh the importance of it. 3. The Shaikh says that he does take tribute from the Islanders every year, but no fixed amount and never an excessive amount. I believe this statement gives a fair representation of what happens. He also said that his son did levy an amount ^ from some of the Islanders who were acting at that time as stor- ers of goods being smuggled from the jpc coast to Persia.P.Z.7511/38 Enclosure in Covering Note from the Petroleum Department, dated 7th November, 1938, 230/26. 7th November, 1938. Dear Baggallay, I am writing to you with reference to your letter of 11th October (5.5262/201/34) about certain problems regarding the definition of the Anglo-Iranian Company’s 100,000 square miles claim in Persia. I have the following observations to make on the three points raised in your letter (1) The Three-mile Limit question . The issue on this point, as we see it, is whether H.M. Government would be prejudiced, e*g. , from the fisheries point of view, if Persian claims to rights outside the three- mile belt were recognised by implication. This is, of course, not really a question for the Petroleum Department. Prom our point of view the balance of advantage in this matter is probably to secure the recognition of rights to acquire minerals as far out as possible from the coast-line of a country so long as an effective method can be found for doing this. But if, as I think we should, we accept Beckett’s idea that the Company's claim should be in relation to sea bed rather than to waters, the point in regard to fisheries probably does not really arise. (3) The question of the hiR~h seas . It seems that there are several zones to be considered here. First, there is the three-mile zone which is unquestion ably Persian territorial waters. Then there is the zone between three and six miles v/here Persia claims territorial rights. Outside that is the zone between six and twelve miles. H.L. Baggallay, Esq., Foreign Office, S.W.l./ /7 (n 7 v* 2 . miles, known to some authorities, I believe, as the ’’approach zone”, where Persia claims certain r ights but perhaps not rights in relation to the sea bed. Finally, there are the high seas proper outside the twelve-mile line. In this country minerals appear unquestionably to vest in the Grown inside the three-mile limit. Outside the three-mile limit, i.e., under our high seas, they appear to vest in the Grown if and when they are effectively occupied by a mining company. This is an illustration of the important point made in Beckett f s minute quoted by you (see for instance, Foreign Office letters A.878/878/47 of 16th March, 1936, paragraph 6 and A.409/47/47 of 2nd March, 1937, paragraph 2, on the Gulf of Paria case referred to in paragraph 6 of your letter under reply) and which as far as we can understand is generally agreed, namely, that outside territorial v/aters, rights to underground land may be acquired by effective acquisition or occupation; although in this case I believe it is contemplated that the acquisition or occupation will be established by the two Governments. We feel, therefore, that the advice to the Company should be something like this:- (i) They should obviously not lay claim to more sea bed than they really think they v/ant, because of the danger of wasting some of their precious 100,000 square miles on territory to which they might not subsequently be able to establish a title: (ii) They should be virtually safe in claiming up to the three-mile line, and probably up to the six-mile line: (iii)Between the six and twelve-mile line, rights could probably be acquired by effective occupation, that is//? (\T 3. is to say, presumably by making artificial constructions and erecting derricks. Once the area has been defined and accepted by the Iranian Government, the Company would be well advised to take immediate steps to establish effective occupation as far as is reasonably practicable. I do not see that we can be at all certain that ringing round the area with buoys v/ould be enough. It will be very unsatisfactory if the company includes in its claim areas from which it is later found impossible to exclude interlopers. (iv) Outside the twelve-mile line the position as to acquisition of rights is the same as in (iii) but it would, I think, hardly be desirable to include such areas within the 100,000 square miles claim, and in any case I gather from the note enclosed with your letter that the Company are not interested in territory outside the twelve-mile line. (v) We fully agree with Beckett’s and your idea that the definition of such a concession should be worded so as to apply to sea bed rather than to waters. Also, words like those proposed by Beckett in the minute which you quote, defining the concession as areas ’'belonging to' the Persians, seem to us right. This case raised the difricult question of artificial islands. On this point our researches have unearthed the interesting case of the Eddystone Lighthouse. The Lighthouse was built on a rock, about ten miles from the Devon coast, not permanently above high water and therefore may, I suppose, be in some respects comparable with the artificial steel and concrete islands v/hich the Anglo-Iranian Company would probably have to build. (Actually, I gather that sometimes undersea oil drilling is done from barges.) Your Department secured an opinion from the Law Officers in 1907 to the/3 /? / the effect that H.M. Government could claim territorial rights within a three-mile radius from the Lighthouse. But it was apparently decided that it would he best not to invoke such rights. The Admiralty, in the Gulf of Paria case, (see their memorandum of February, 1936, enclosed v/ith letter M.395/36 of 9th April, 1936, to the Colonial Office) are strongly opposed to the view that artificial islands acquire a territorial belt, though this view was not shared by the Hague Conference of 1930. This may be a red herring and in any case it would probably be best not to raise the issue of artificial islands in this case. (2) The Shatt-el-Arab . I return your Admiralty chart of the mouth of the river v/hich you sent to Quirk on the 31st October. The line about which you spoke to the Company on 7th September is, I suppose, the same as the red line BC on your chart, assuming that by the ’'general trend of Persian coast” (see chart) you mean the same as 'the prolongation of the final section of the left bank of the river” (paragraph 9 of your note of 7th September). I gather that the line v/hich H.M. Government thinks should be the international boundary (referred to in paragraph 7 of your letter of 11th October) is the Blue Line. I can quite well see that there are reasons why you would prefer that the boundary of the concession did not coincide v/ith any of the suggested international boundaries. In the circumstances, it seems to us that BC, or something like it, would be a satisfactory line for the concession boundary, although it may not include the largest possible area of sea bed. I am sending copies of this letter to Gibson, Jones, and the Board of Trade. Yours sincerely, Sd. F. c.

Baggallay, Esq. , Foreign Office, 'S.P. 1 .P.S.6994/1933. (E 5262/201/34) FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. 11th October, 1938 Dear Gibson, I enclose herein a record of a discussion which I had last month with Mylles, Lees and Browne, of the Anglo- I rani an Oil Company, arising from their v/ish to have some advice about the Dest way of defining the Company f s concession area in Persia, v/hich, as you icnow, has to be done before the 31st December? 1938. You will see that we were concerned with three points, namely : (1) whether His Majesty's Government would raise any objection to the maritime boundary of the concession area being drawn, in places, outside the three mile territorial limit, (2) How to draw the boundary at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, and (3) What is the position as regards the High Seas. Since the meeting I have been able to confirm that what I said about the High Seas, as recorded in paragraph 11 ol the enclosure, was correct, and that the generally recognised view of international lav/ with regard to the bed 01 the open sea and the subsoil beneath it is that the sea bed and the subsoil is res nullius , but that it is capable of acquisition by effective occupation in the same manner as any unoccupied territory above the level of the sea. 4* During the meeting, however, it escaped my mind that questions ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) above were dealt with in recent correspondence between the India Office and ourselves about the concession to oe granted to Petroleum Concessions Limited in the 'Bahrein Unallotted Area'. In that case, too, the question arose how to define the maritime boundary of the concession,/5./ 2 . concession, and our point of view was explained in a minute by Beckett enclosed in fireman's letter to you no. E 2285 / 413/91 of the 25 th April, 1938. In this minute Beckett pointed out that as far as ^the maritime regions of the concession were concerned, the covious intention was that the Company should have the right to extract oil from the land under t he sea , and that although the Sheikh of Bahrein had at present no right to land under the sea outside the three mile limit, it is recognised that the bed of the sea and the land under it is capable of acquisition beyond that limit. For this reason Beckett recommended that it would be better to substitute for the word 'waters” in the draft concession the words 'submerged land', the effect of which would be to give the Company the right to the land below the sea immediately within the three mile limit and also outside the three mile limit a s soon as _pn ey had appropriated it . ^ ho.. I think this suggestion of Beckett points to ti.e means ’we are looking for of evading the difficulty about territorial waters which presents itself, or seened. to do so, m the case of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's concession in Psioic*. oince ny discussions with the Company's representatives I have looked up the Persian law about territorial waters. Copies of tms law were sent to you under cover of Foreign Office letter No. T 8364/4140/380 of the 3rd Augusa 1534 and a 1 urtaer copy is enclosed herein for convenience of reference. You will see from Article X that although the Persians claim the right of control to a distance of twelve miles from the coast, they lay specific claim to the bed of the sea only as far as six miles. Possibly, however, they would maintain that 'national interests' entitle them to control of mineral deposits Up Uo the full twelve mile limit.3. 5* Vc would suggest, therefore, that the Company should place the- limits of their concession, wherever they wish to do so, up to a distance of twelve miles from the Persian coast, making it clear that the areas included beyond the coast are areas of sea bed . This v/ould prevent the possibility of the Persian G-overnment, at some future date, claiming the right - which, owing to the diversity of views about territorial waters, it would be difficult to dispute - to grant to another concern portions of the sea bed inside the twelve mile limit in which the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company might be interested. Prom the Persian point of view the entire area within the limits drawn by the Company would then be Persian territory. Prom the point of view of His Majesty’s Government, however, the area as delimited would consist of Persian territory only up to the three mile limit, and as regards trie p^Pt' 3 of the sea bed outside that limit which the Company would have included in their concession area, the Company would not really have a right to them - as being under the High Seas - until they had taken steps to appropriate them. ii.s we are presumably not in the least anxious that these areas should be appropriated by anybody else, both the Persians and ourselves v/ould be perfectly happy. b * You will also be aware that in July 1936 our Legation at Caracas were instructed to initiate discussions with the Venezuelan Government with a view to the Governments of Trinidad and Venezuela taking simultaneous and parallel action to divide up as national territory between them the sea bed of the Gulf of Pain.a or such parts of it as might be of use for oil boring. 7 * As regards question (2) namely the best way of drawing the boundary of the Company’s area at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab (referred to in paragraph 9 of the enclosed record), it has since occurred to me that the Company should draw/I 4- draw their boundary here in such a way as to keea clear of the line dividing Persian from Iraqi territorial waters, as His Majesty’s Government conceive the line should most fairly be drawn (i.e. the principle that a ship is always in the waters of the country to whose coast it is closest). The difficulty about the Company doing this would, I think, be that they could not give any satisfactory explanation to the Persian Government if the latter were inquisitive about their reason for drawing the line in such a peculiar way, since it would have no geological justification. So far as geology is concerned, the Company’s desire is to get as much of the sea bed as they can in that part of the world. 6 * I should be grateful if you would let me know as soon as you can if you agree with the foregoing views, or if you have any comments to make. I am s ending a similar letter to Jones (Admira 11 y) and Starling (Petroleum Department) and an sending a copy to the Board of Trade. Yours ever, ( Sd.) Lacy Baggallay.P. 2.6994/1938. COPY. (S 5262/201/34) Anglo-Iranian Oil Company* C one e ssion Area. Y.r. Ay lies, of* the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, called on mr. Bagg^llay this afternoon, accompanied hy Dr. Lees, the Company’s Chief ideologist and fir. ¥. E. Browne, the Company’s Surveyor, in order to ash advice about the best ;vay of defining the limits of the area or areas totalling 100,000 square miles of Persian territory which the Company were now ooliged, be±ore the 31st December 1933 and under the terms of the 1933 Concession Agreement, to choose as those in which they wished to operate their concession for the future. 2. Mr. Mylies and his colleagues explained that up to certain depths of water modern boring machinery made it possible to tap oil fields lying under the sea and that there were parts of the sea in the Persian Gulf which the Company wished to include in the area of their potential operations. They understood that His Majesty's Government held that three miles was the limit of territorial waters, whereas the Persian Government claimed a belt of tvleve miles. Along most of the Persian coast the width of sea which the Company wished to include in their concession was within the three mile limit. At the northern end of the Gulf, however, there were parts of the sea in the twelve mile belt -which they wished to include. 3- Furthermore the chosen areas had to be precisely demarcated in order that the Persian Government might be able to checm the measurements for themselves and mame sure that they did not exceed 100,000 square miles in all. This applied to the demarcation of such sections of the boundaries as followed/2 followed existing proposed (whether most of the coast as well as to inland sections, maps of Southern Persia were inaccurate it to sho'w these boundaries hy fixing certain on land or sea) and joining them together. As the was c oordinate j^l ong the coast they v/ould fix a number of straight lines just skirting the coast-line on the seaward side, with the object of allowing for uncertainties or future changes in that line and also of rendering mensuration easier. At Jask they would carry the boundary out for about three miles. It was only at the northern end, as had been said, that they wished to carry it out for as far as twelve miles. 4* The Company wished to know whether the submission by them to the Persian Government of plans showing that they had chosen for their concession areas extending beyond the three mile limit, approved as they would necessarily have been by the Board of Directors, of whom two ’were representatives of His Majesty’s Government, would commit His Majesty’s Government to a recognition of the Persian claim to a territorial limit of twelve miles. In other words, would His Majesty’s Government object to the inclusion in the concession areas of waters outside the three mile limit ? 5* Mr. Baggallay explained shortly the position as regards territorial waters. it was true that His Majesty’s Government, largely, he thought, for reasons connected with iisheries, held to the three mile limit. Most other countries accepted this view. Persia, however, claimed twelve miles, thougn he thought that she regarded this belt as divided into two fringes of six miles each and claimed rights falling short of full sovereignty in the outer fringe. He would look up the Persian lav/ on the subject and let the Company know exactly what it laid down. Other countries besides Persia, for instance/? - 7 W 3* instance Norway, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and he believed Portugal, also claimed more than three miles. 6 . The position in international lan was uncertain. Efforts to reach international agreement on the subject had so far come to nothing, and although other countries could not say that His Majesty’s G-overnnent were wrong in maintaining that the proper limit was three miles, His Majesty’s Government could not say that those countries were wrong in saying that the limit could and should be increased. Thus, if the matter were referred to arbitration the case would probably go in favour of whoever happened to be the defendant. If, for instance, His Majesty’s Government took the Persian Government to court because they objected to some act of sovereignty done by the Persian Government or their agents in waters lying between three and twelve miles from the Persian coast, they would probably be told that they had failed to prove that the Persian Government had no right to do what they had done in those waters. If on the other hand the Persian Government took His Majesty’s Government to court because of something done Dy, say, one of His Majesty’s Ships in such waters, they would probably be the ones to be told that they had failed to show that the warship had no right to do what it had done. 7* It was conceivable that, as time went on, the mineral potentialities of the bed of the sea, as brought to light by the problem facing the present meeting, would prove to be more important than questions of fishing rights and make it de sirable for His Ma j e s ty’s Gove ninent the mselves to claim more extensive territorial limits. (Dr. Lees quoted a case in point from the seas adjoining Trinidad). This, however, was mere speculation and for the moment His Majesty’s Government were concerned to maintain as best they could, notwithslanding/11 4. notwithstanding the uncertain legal position he had described, principle oi the three mile limit* Nevertheless he thought that His majesty's Government would not wish? if they could possibly avoid it, to press the Company to forego the posoibility of coring outside the three mile limit in conditions giving them a reasonable assurance of exclusive possession. He v/ondered whether, in order to make it as easy as possible for His majesty's Government to do so, it would not be possible to iinu some formula whereby the area delimited by the Co.many could be referred to in such terms as would not identify it too closely with either the three mile or the twelve mile limit. He nlso enquired whether it would not be possible to say simply tnut in certain places the boundaries of the concession area or areas were 'the limits of Persian territorial waters'. it was, after all, possible that before the Company's concession expired in 1993 an international conference might fix territorial waters at six or ten or even twenty miles. Such a formula would guard the Company against all eventualities. In any case he would line to give tne matter further consideration. 8 * Mr* Mylies and his colleagues thought a suitable formula could be f ound and said that they also ’would give it their thought. They did net, however, think that a mere mention of the 'limits of territorial waters' would be sufficient, since the Persian Government would either regard it as too vague, or else claim that it meant that the whole of the twelve mile vor at least six mile) limit was included in the concession areas - which might swallow up a lot of the 100,000 square miles. 9. They next asked how the Company should draw the ooundary of their area at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, seeing tho.t the frontier was delimited only as far as a point just below/5* below Fao on the left bank of had given a short explanation Government saw it, under the Verbaux and of the various me the river. After Mr. Baggallay of the position, as His Majesty’s 19^3 Protocol and the 1914 Proces thods which had been advanced for defining international frontiers where they passed through territorial waters (none of which had, however, universal international sanction), he said that so long as the Company choose a boundary which left the whole Hooka Channel outside their area he did not think (subject to the question of territorial 'Waters already discussed) that His Majesty’s Government would wish to raise any objection to their fixing one of their coordinates at the tip of Marakat Abadan and from there carrying their line out to sea more or less as a prolongation of the final section of the left bah; of the river. The Company’s representatives agreed to avoid the Hooka Channel completely. 10. Dr. Lees then asked what was the position as regards e-mo High seas. 'youId it be possible for the Company, if they v^isned to do so, to sink shafts in the High Seas, join them together with buoys and ropes and claim exclusive rights within the area thus enclosed ? 11. Mr. Baggallay said that it was considered to be legally possible in certain circumstances to stake a claim to P u ^ oi the sea as opposed to its surface. The pearl 1 ishers in the Persian Gulf might be said to have acquired prescriptive rights to certain banks in the High Seas, and he oelieved that some of the Cornish tin mines extended out to sea beyond the three mile limit and that His Majesty’s Government claimed that the tin deposits -which lay under the sea outside txie three mile limit could be and had been appropriated. But these were both examples of rights acquired as the result of exclusive enjoyment and possession during a long period of time. The/10 (S 6. The general theory was that the High Seas could not he appropriated hy States or individuals and though he thought that there might be nothing to prevent the Company from boring anywhere they liked in the bed of the sea below the High Seas, so long as they did not thereby interfere with navigation or fisheries, it seemed to him very doubtful if they would be able to shut off a larger area than they needed for each shaft and claim exclusive rights within that area. In other words they would not be able to appropriate an entire oil formation below the High Seas or prevent anybody else from sluicing shafts adjoining their own. If, on the other hand, nobody else did in fact sink any shafts, they might in course of time acquire a prescriptive right to such a formation. 12. In conclusion, Mr. Mylles and his colleagues emphasised the fact that the question was far from being academic. Their researches pointed to the probability that five or six large oil fields mighx. lie somewhere in the region comprised by the flat country at the head of the Persian Gulf and the adjacent sea and in a few years it might be technically possible to tap the fields under the sea through even greater depths of v/ater than at present. It was quite possible that in about ten years they might wish to start operations in parts of the sea-bed lying as far as twelve miles from the Persian Coast at the northern end of the Persian Gulf.

To the honourable National Consultative Assembly: In order that the limits of frontier waters of the State, and of zones of control of the Government in the sea be defined, and in order to avoid certain misunderstandings, I now submit, and request the acceptance of, a bill containing eight articles which specifies the limits of frontier waters unci of the control of the government in the seas of Persia. st cha P te r. : On territorial waters and zones of control: Article I. That portion of the sea which extends along the coast up to the distance of six nautical miles from the coasts of Persia, reckoned from the lowest tides, is accounted Persian territorial water, and in this zone whatever is situated below the bottom 01 the sea, on the surface of the sea, and above it, belongs to the State of Persia. Moreover, in regard to the execution of certain laws and agreements relating to security, defence, national interests, or to the preservation of shipping routes, another Zone, which shall be named the Zone of Naval Control, and shall be such that the Imperial Government shall have /2. have the right of control therein, shall extend parallel to the coast to a distance of twelve nautical miles from the limit of the lowest tide. Remar k: A nautical mile is equivalent to 1,552 metres. Article II : ¥ith regard to hays (or 'little gulfs') the boundary of territorial waters shall begin from a straight line Joining tne outermost point of one side of the bay to the outermost point of the other side of the bay: and if the width of the mouth of the bay is more than ten nautical miles, t:.e line of tne territorial waters shall oe situated at the nearest part of the union of the bay with the sea, that part being such that its breadth does not exceed ten nautical miles. Y/lth regard to ports, the limit of territorial waters v/ill begin from a line lying between the permanent buildings of one port which are the furthest advanced in the direction of the sea. Article III. Every island which belongs to Persia shall have special territorial waters of its own, the limits of which will du determined in accordance with the arrangements laid down in Article 1 (the first portion). In regard to an archipelago the islands which compose it shall be regarded as a single island, ^nd the distance of the territorial waters of the archipelago snail be reckoned from those islands which are furthest from the centre of the archipelago. — nd Cha P t e^- The conditions of entry and anchorage of foreign war-ships in Persian waters, and the arrangements laid down for them: Article IV./,.rticlc IV. Foreign war-ships and submarines, on condition that they travel on the surface of the water, have the right of innocent passage through the territorial waters of Persia, unless the above-mentioned ships belong to States wliich are at war, in which case the national and international dispositions which are laid down for times of war and for the safeguarding of neutrality will be put into force. The conditions of transit for war-ships, alluded to in the first portion of this Article, shall be defined in a special Regulation, particularly with regard to the fixation of the number of those ships. ..^ro;:clc v. The conditions of anchorage of foreign warships in Persian territorial waters shall also be determined in a special Regulation. The above-mentioned ships must observe, while ill the waters alluded to in t is Lav/, the Laws and Regulations of Persia. A rticle VI . The Government may, on grounds of national protection, or for other important causes, prohibit the transit or anchorage of foreign warships in certain ports or in xoortions of territorial waters. The above-mentioned ports and portions will be named 'Forbidden Zones'. Article VII. Foreign war-ships, on condition of reciprocity, will be exempt from customs inspection, and customs duties will be charged only on those goods which are imported from the above-mentioned ships to the coast for consumption. The above-mentioned shirjs, on condition of reciprocity, will be exempt from port dues, tonnage dues, and similar imposts. Article VIII . The examination of misdemeanours ( junheh ) and crimes ( janayat ) which may take place on foreign war-ships are4. outside the jurisdiction of Persian courts. Sentences of capital punishment which may be pronounced by foreign courts must not be executed in Persian territorial waters or zones of control. Prime Minister.

Dear Jones, In paragraph 3 of your letter No. M. 05014/38 of the 30th September about the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s new concession, you refer to the suggestion that the Company might consider offering an ex gratia payment to the Sheikh of Sharjah in respect of oil won in Sirri or its territorial waters. An objection which we see to this proposal is that. even if the Company could be persuaded to adopt it, it would probably lead the Sheikh of Sharjah to consider that we attach more practical value to his claim than is, unfortunately, the case. Moreover we think it would be rather unfair to put the idea to the Company without some clearer indication of what they - or at any rate His Majesty’s Government - were to get from it in the way of advantages. I have accordingly said nothing about the idea in my letter P.H. Jones, Esq. Admiralty.letter to the Company, of which you will receive a copy separately; hut we shall he very glad to consider it further if you have other considerations to put forward. 4.

Dear Mylles, You will remember that when you and Elkington came to see me on the 8 th August you asked, among other things, for information about the status of the following islands in the Persian Gulf-Sirri, Nabiya Farur, Farur, Nabiya Tunb, Tunb and Abu Musa - in order that your Company should be able to decide whether these islands could be included in the 100,000 square miles of Persian territory which they have to choose as their concession area before the end of the year. 2. At the meeting which I had with you, Lees and Browne on the 7th September, you asked the same question about Farsi and Arabi. 3. I am now able to let you have the definite answer about all these islands which T promised you. The answer largely confirms what I said during our conversations. 4. It is as follows (a) Nabiya Tunb, Tunb and Abu Musa are, inbe excluded from the Company’s concession area. (b) -On the evidence available, Farsi and Arabi must be regarded as belonging to the Sheikh of Koweit and should likewise be excluded from the Company’s area. v/e are, however, anxious to avoid entering into any controversy with the Iranian Government about these islands and it would help us if the Company could refrain from saying anything abou- the Sheikh’s claims to them to the Iranians. (c) Farur is indisputably Iranian, and Little Farur, though its status has never been formally determined, must be regarded as Iranian too. There is therefore no objection to the Company including these two islands in their concession area, if they so desire. (d) Sirri -i(d) sirri has 'been in the effective occupation of the Iranians since 1887, and since the existence of this occupation has from time to time received de fact o recognition from His Majesty’s Government, we should not object to the Company including the island, if they wish, in their concession area without making any reference to its doubtful ownership, if the Company do include it, we shall consider v/hether we should at some stage make some declaration to the Persian Government which, without raising the question of status in a controversial form, will make it clear that, although acquiescing in the inclusion of the island in the Company’s concession area, we reserve our position, as before, regarding its international status.

We have no information as to the geological conditions and petroleum prospects of the islands referred to. Judging by the interview which you had with Elkington and Mylles in August, the Anglo-Iranlan Oil Company themselves were not then very certain as to the prospects and they are in the best position to know as they have been working for so many years on the geology of the Persian Gulf Area. The areas of the three islands concerned appear to be very amall in relation to the total area to be selected for inclusion in the concession, and in order to avoid complications in the future should they prove to be oil bearing, it would seem desirable to include them. I am sending a copy of this letter to Gibson. Yours sincerely. Jr n ph 1 A BLjI H. L. Bag* allay.

In view of the recent correspondence on this subject (in which the latest letter seems to be Jarrett f s letter to you M. 02607/38 of the 3rd June), I supi) 0 se we must say that, in view of the claims of the Sheikh of Koweit, (or perhaps in view of the fact that we consider Persia has at present no claim to these islands and they either belong to the Sheikh of Koweit or are res null jus and v/e do not want Persia to try to occupy them) the Company ought not to attempt to include either of these islands in their area (it may *ESfl. PQL OEPr’l 23 SEP 1938 INDIA OPKlorr be/ J.P. Gibson, Esq.'be the case that they are not 'interesting' from the oil point of view in any case). We should also have to ask the Company not to say anything about the Sheikh* s claims to the Persians* 3. We should he placed in a somewhat embarrassing position vis-h-vis the Company if at any future date the Persian Government were able effectively to assert a claim to at least one of the Islands, and thereafter to give that island as part of an oil concession to some other Company than the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. In this connexion, as we have said before, we do not consider it is possible to give the Sheikh of Koweit or anyone else a guarantee that His Majesty’s Government would be able effectively to uphold his claims. The most we could say would be that we would do our best if the case ever arose. But in view of the general concensus of opinion as to the undesirability of giving these islands to anyone else than the Sheikh of Koweit, we must no doubt face this possible embarrassment 4 .

My dear Gibson, Elkington and Mylles of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company came to see me on the 8 th August seeking certain information about the boundaries of Persian territory,. The Company need this information in view of the fact that they must before the 31st December next choose 100 r 000 square miles of Persian territory and operate their concession within these 100,000 square miles only thereafterc 2o In the first place, Elkington and Mylles wished to see the texts of the two instruments which are mentioned in the Perso-Iraqi Frontier Treaty of the 4th July 1937, i 0 e« the protocol of the 4th November 1913 and the proces-verbaux of the Delimitation Commission of 1914 insofar as they lay down the boundary at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab® I showed them these two documents and let them take notes of the important passages (see Page 4 of/c&amp;) of the protocol, eleven lines from the hottom of the page, and page 11 (Deuxieme Seance) in the proces verhaux. 3. I explained that the position was complicated 'by the fact that, even in 1914, the Commissioners had said that the frontier started at a point which was in fact an appreciable distance from the mouth of the river, and that since 1914 the land on either side of the mouth of the river had grown still further, but added that we were reasonably confident that, if it came to the point, we could dispose of this difficulty, and uphold the contention that the frontier between Iraq and Iran, as laid down by the 1913-1914 documents and confirmed by the Treaty of the 4th July 1937, followed the low water line on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab until the river reached the open sea. 4. With regard to th 0 question of what line the frontier should follow when once it reached the open sea (which we took to be when it reached the extreme southerly tip of Marakat Abadan), I said that, in the opinion/(g) opinion of His Majesty’s Govemment, the most natural, simple and reasonable method of dividing territorial waters was to plot a line all points on which were equidistant from the nearest points on the two coasts, which was another way of saying that a ship would always be in the territorial v/aters of the country to whose coast it happened to be closest at any particular moment. I made it clear, however, that this was only the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, and that the point could not be said to be covered by international law, since no rule of law had grown up by custom and there had never been any authoritative arbitral decision. 5. Elkington and Mylles then asked for information upon the status of the following islands — Q . . / / \ birri, Nabiya Parur, Farur, Nabiya Tunb, Tunb and Abu Musa. 6 . I explained that Sirri had been occupied by the Persians in 1887, and effectively administered by them ever since, end that we had from time to time recognised that the Persians were in effective occupation by notifying them when British survey vessels, for/for example, wished to go there; tout that we had also always made it clear that this recognition of the de facto position did not imply that we admitted in any way that they had any legal right to the sovereignty of the island. On the other hand, we were prepared, as the Persians knew quite well, to recognise their sovereignty over the island as part of a general settlement of Persian Gulf questions. 7. With regard to the others, the position of Natoiya Parur was that it was indeterminate, inasmuch as it had never toeen recognised toy us as toelonging to Persia. At the same time, no one else had any good claim to it, and it was most unlikely that we would wish to make any troutole in the event of Persians claiming it as theirs. In all protoatoility, the Persians had in fact regarded it as theirs for many years past, and would quite likely toe surprised and indignant at any suggestion to the contrary. Parur was unquestionatoly Persian. Natoiya Tunto, Tunto and Atou Musa, on the other hand,wore unquestionatoly Arato - or at least so we always maintained - although the Persians claimed them in the same way as they/they claimed Bahrein. 8 . Llkington said that, in view of what I had said, it was clear that the Company must rule the last three islands out of their calculations altogether, and make no attempt to include them in the 100,000 square miles. As regards Farur, on the other hand, the Company would clearly he in order in including it in their area if they decided that it was worth including. There seemed to he some douht, however, over Sirri and Nahiya Farur, end he asked what I thought the Company should do. 9 . I said that, speaking offhand and entirely personally, I thought that, if these islands were sufficiently ,f interesting”, from the oil point of view, to he worth including in the 100,000 square miles, the Company should include them and have done with it and, what was more, include them without making any reference to their doubtful ownership. This seemed to me unquestionably the right line in the case of Nabiya Farur, hut I also tk.lt pretty confident that it was the right line in the case of Cirri too. If this island was ' interesting”/u interesting' and the Company did not take it, the Persians would he free to include it in a concession to some other company, possibly and indeed probably a non-British company. It was most unlikely that, if that happened, His Majesty’s Government would in the upshot be able to take any effective action to stop them, and the result would be that His Majesty’s Government would have the worst of all worlds. If the Company followed the course which I had suggested, the result might be to reduce yet further such small bargaining value as Sirri still possessed for His Majesty’s Government, and this might still be the case even if His Majesty’s Government made some declaration, on having the terms of the new concession area brought to their notice, to the effect that they did not recognise Sirri as being under Persian sovereignty. But this was, in my opinion, a lesser evil than leaving Sirri as a possible prey to some other company and losing its bargaining value anyhow. 10 . Elkington said that, in view of these explanations, the Company would now go ahead and try to form some idea as to whether the islands of Farur, Nabiya Farur and Sirri were worth including in the future concession/It,’] (ST) / concession area, and would, in the event of their deciding that Sirri was worth including, go ahead, and include it, if we agreed, without more ado. I said that I thought this would he all right, and undertook to find out as quickly as possible whether the views I had expressed were approved. 11. Elkington also explained that it was the present intention of the Gornpany to include the whole of the Persian coast line from the Iraqi frontier to the Baluchistan frontier, for at least a short distance inland, in the new area. They could not afford to have other companies actually on the coast. They would also in certain places have to include parts of the sea under which oil might conceivably be found, and it was for this reason that the frontier position at the mouth of the Shatt—el—Arab was, or might be, of importance to them. The method they proposed to adopt in doing this was to define certain astronomically fixed points, the lines joining which would be the limits of the area. For instance, one part of the new concession area would probably/Li &lt;3 probably be described as being bounded on the South-East by the frontier dividing Persia from Iraq from such and such a point to the sea, from the point where the frontier meets the sea to an astronomical point abc, from there to astronomical point xyz, and so forth. 12 . I should be very grateful if you could let me know as soon as possible whether you think that any modification is needed in the views I expressed about Sirri. I have little doubt in my own mind what the company ought to do if they think Sirri worth including m their area. I am less sure about what His Majesty's Government ought to do if confronted with a concession agreement between the company and the Persians including Sirri (it would make little difference whether Sirri was mentioned by name or lumped with other islands as being northof a certain line drawn between points in the sea). I feel we should have to say something, but we should have to try to say it without dragging the company into political questions. Perhaps we could say something to the effect that we regarded the inclusion of the island as/as the natural outcome of the fact that the Persians were, as we had always recognised, in actual and effective occupation, hut that we reserved our position as before, as to its international status. 13. I am sending copies of this letter to Starling and Jarrett,CONFIDENTIAL. INDIA OFFICE E. ‘)97. P. 4512/28. Status of the Islands of Tamb, Little Tamb, Abu Musa, and Sirri. I.—Introductory. 1. Tanib, Abu Musa, and Sirri are three small islands lying well out in the Persian Gulf between the Trucial Arab coast and the Persian island of Kishm. Little Tamb, an uninhabited and waterless island, 1 mile long by | mile wide, 8 miles to the west of Tamb, was agreed by the Government of India, the India Office and the Foreign Office in 1908, to depend from that island.* Tamb itself is an island 17 miles south of the south-west point of Kishm Island and 4G miles north-west of the nearest point on the coast of Trucial Oman, roughly circular in shape, and about miles in diameter. A lighthouse was erected on it by His Majesty’s Government in 1913 (see paras. 25 to 28 below). It is sparsely inhabited and almost waterless. It appears probable that deposits of red oxide are to be found both m it and m Little Tamb. Abu Musa is a larger and more thickly populated island, a few miles nearer to Shargah in Trucial Oman than to Lingah in Persia, with good supplies of water, and valuable deposits of red oxide which have been under exploitation for some years, and royalty in respect of which is paid to the ruling family of Shargah. Sirri, 40 miles south by west of Bustaneh, the nearest point on the Persian coast, is more prosperous and fertile than Tamb, and, like it. contains deposits of red oxide, though these are apparently unimportant.| 2. The history and status of these islands is identical. A hile, however, the Trucial Sheikh of Shargah on the Arab coast still contiols lamb and Abu Musa, on which he flies his flag. His Majesty’s Government, and the Sheikh under protest, have since 1887 tacitly acquiesced in Persian occupation of Sirri. The Persian flag was stated to have been hoisted on Little Tamb in IflOLf at the time of the Persian aggression on Tamb and Abu Musa. It was presumably removed at ihe same time as it was removed from those islands; but the Political Resident reported in November 1908 that the Shargah flag had not been flown on Little Tamb by the Sheikh.§ It is not known whether steps have since been taken to do this. 3. The islands are claimed by the Trucial Sheikhs of Shargah as representative of the Jowasimi Arab chiefs, one section of whom in the 18th century established themselves by force or alliance at Lingah and elsewhere in South Persia. The Persian claim to the islands has in the past been based on the fact that the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs of Lingah, under whose administrative control they were for many years prior to 1887, had for long been Persian subjects governing Lingah as Persian officials, and it was suggested that it was in this capacity that they had administered the islands, which had become Persian territory. The latest Persian claim is based on the fact that the islands, together with Farur, are shown as Persian in a War Office map of 1887 of which copies were presented to the Shah by the Minister at Teheran, under the orders of Lord Salisbury, in July 1888 (cp. paras. 34 and 36 below). 4. The recent reassertion of the Persian claim to the island of Tamb renders necessary a more detailed examination of the history of that island, and of the islands of Abu Musa and Sirri, the status of which is identical, than would otherwise have been the case. Persian ownership of Farur does not appear to have been disputed in the past; the island is in any event in a different category from Abu Musa, Tamb and Sirri, and no reference is made to it in the present Memorandum. II.—History of the Islands prior to 1887. 5. It has proved impossible to trace any reference to the history of the islands in the 17 th and 18th centuries.

Occupation of Sirri by Persia, 1887.J *th e year 1877 an armed Persian party, with two small mrmnr was sent to ereet a flagstaff and hoist the Persian flag on Sirri o itical Resident, the Minister at Teheran, having enquired^ whether th islands were under British protection, and whether any action at Teheh was necessary, replied that Sirri and Tamb were beyond'the zone of Pershi interference, and that the islands belonged to Arab Chiefs under Britri protection m common with Arabs of the Persian littoral. The Residen separately reported to the Government of India that the islands formed par ol the hereditary estates of the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs; that for many year* weveT their management, administration and jurisdiction had hv commoi consent been vested m tl,e chief Jowasimi Sheikh on the Persian coas iz., the Sheikh of Lingah for the time being; that the Jowasimi Sheikh- domiciled on the Persian coast had acquired the status of shbiects o ^rLingah‘^hat 7he 0 Iw rUed l Lingah bad been - in ^t, Persian official! il P ’ 11 p ersian olaim doubtless based on these oroumR and that, were it not for the fact that the Arab Sheikhs of the Oman omsi J m y owned the islands, the Persian position could not be disputed. The3 Resident supported his statement with the translation of a letter written in 1877 by the Sheikh Ali-biu-Khalifah of Lingah to the Chief of Ras-al-Khainia, in which the former “ admits that Tamb is a dependency of the Kowasim of Oman, and that the Persians have no property there nor any right to interfere, save with the consent of the Chief of Ras-al-Khaima.” In conclusion, he expressed the opinion that the Persian Government had no good title to the islands in question.|| 11. The Sheikh of Shargah protested to the Resident on 16th October 1887 against the Persian action at Sirri, and asked that similar action at Tamb might be prevented. The Government of India felt, however, some difficulty as to the action to be taken, in view of the fact that Persian Jowasnms had joint rights on Sirri and lamb, and that one Arab Sheikh only had appealed, and it was agreed, in consultation with the Resident, that, no overt action having been taken by Persia in the case of lamb, representations at Teheran should be confined to the question of Sirri.* 12 On representations being made, the Persian Government stated! that for nine years Sirri and 1 amb had paid taxes to the 1 eisian Government, and that, documents in support of tne Persian claim being at Pushire, the Governor had been instructed to explain matters to the Resident. The Governor, however, informed the Resident that he had no documents relating to the Persian claim, and that he had wired to the Amin-es-Sultan excusing himself from discussing the question with the Resident.”! Enquiry \vas independently made of the Chief of Shargah as to the Amin-es-Sultan’s statement. The Chief’s reply explained the connection of the Governors of Lingah with the island of Sirri, and added that Tamb was uninhabited, and that no taxes had been paid to Persia. He further enclosed three letters from Chiefs of Lingah, admitting the Chief of Shargah’s ownership of Tamb.§ 13. The Persian Government had meanwhile produced five official letters from a former Sheikh of Lingah (A usuf-bin-Mahomad) in suppoit of the Persian claim to the two islands.I| The Resident,^ after examination, replied “ that he considered that the documents did not bear out the Persian claim, and that weight should not be attached to the statements of the Sheikh in question, who was a dependant and servant of the Jowasimi Sheikh, Ali- biii'Khalifah [cp. para. 10 above], whom he murdered in order himself to become Chief of Lingah,” and, the Persian Minister appearing to rely on a statement of Sheikh Yusuf that he had “ gone to the island of Sirri to inspect and recover Government (Persian) dues,” the Resident wrote that he considered that “ this statement could not be accepted as establishing or even supporting the Persian claim to possession, nor as sufficient to deprive the Jowasimi Arab family of their ancient and previously recognised rights on that island.” (It may be added that on 29th March 1884 Sheikh Yusuf wrote to the Chief of Ras-al-Khaima fully admitting the possession of Tamb by die Jowasimis.)§§ The Resident further pointed oat that the Jowasimi Sheikhs of Lingah had usually also been Deputy-Governors of Lingah on behalf of Persia; they exercised authority on Sirri island, but it was qua Jowasimi Sheikh and not qua Persian Governor. || Pol.

The Persian Government, on enquiry being made*'*' as to the grounds on which they ** Note of Mar. 6 had annexed Sirri, repliedtf that it was in their possession, being a isas. dependency of Lingah, to which the Legation replied that jurisdiction tt Note °t Mar. 10 over Sirri had been exercised by the Governors of Lingah solely in their capacity of Jowasimi Sheikhs, that the traditional rights over Sirri of the Jowasimi Sheikhs had never been disputed and were generally recognised, that the hoisting of the Persian flag altered the existing status, and that it was on this ground that Her Majesty’s Government desired that reasons should be shown for this alteration. The note, after adding that while “ possession, if of long standing, and undisputed, undoubtedly carried considerable weight . . . the argument would ^ scarcely govern in the present instance,” concluded by asking the Persian Government to com municate “ the proofs they possess of the former dependence of Sirri island on Persian authority.”4 # P. 737/04. t F.O. to I.O., April 23 1904; to F.O., May 4 P 2559/04 r ^ ie SSth A 2 )ril 1888 the Resident communicated to the Minister at Teheran a copy of the translation of a report drawn up locally for the Amin-es-Sultan, which lie had obtained privately, relative to the' Persian claims. It appears that “ there was nothing fresh in this report beyond a new claim put forward to the island of Abu Musa,” which, again to quote the Resident, ” has no justification whatever.” In the summer of the same year ^ (26th July) the Minister telegraphed to Bushire that a reply had now been received from the Persian Government that “as the Jowasimi Sheikhs were Persian Governors of Lingah, they considered no further proof of the justice of their claim necessary.” To this the Resident replied that the Persian iGp j bcggt d the question, cincl that the Arab contention as regards Sirri was that the Jowasimi Sheikhs of Lingah represented the family, and derived no light fiom then position towards the Persian Government 16. In order to facilitate the disposal of other negotiations, His Mai'esty's Government decided in August 1888 tacitly to acquiesce in the Persian occupation of Sirri. Save, however, by such acquiescence, to which reference was made in official correspondence with Persia in 1904 (see para. 21 below), they have never in any way admitted or withdrawn their ordinal objections to the claim of the Shah’s Government to the ownershin of the island, while the Political Resident stated in 1904 that it was equally clear from the Residency records that the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast had never voluntarily dropped their claim, which they had formally reiterated m 1895, to proprietary rights over Sirri, anv more than over Abu Musa and l amb. iv.- I.O. 1904, lemporary Persian Occupation of Abu Musa and Tamb, 1904 17 In January 1903 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that, trade having to a large extent been diverted from Lingah as the result oi (he short-sighted policy of the Belgian Customs officials, Lingah merchants were endeavouring to arrange with the Bombay and Persian Navigation Company to make the island of Abu Musa a port of call. He addetf that m view of the Sirri incident of 1887, he was apprehensive lest the result mignt be the advancing of a territorial claim to this island by Pers'u The Resident stated that the island undoubtedly belonged to the Jowasimi Sheikh , Shargah, that the Jowasimis did not, however, fly a flag on the island and that it might be well to advise the Sheikh of Shargah to do so as 'Li of ownership. Ibis course was approved and action taken accordingly. 18 The question having arisen of advising the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaima (a sheikhdom at that time and now dependent from the Sheikh of SlnreuM to adopt a Similar course in regard to the island of Tamb, which beWed to the Ras-al-Khairaa section of the Jowasimis, the Resident reported that 0 so tar as he was aware, sovereignty over that island had never been asserted &gt;y eisia, that the Sheikh of Shargah in his existing capacity as Ruler of ui.s-a -khaima claimed it as an appanage of the Jowasimis of the Arab coast and that he was m possession of documentary evidence in the shane of letters from two former Arab Chiefs of Lingah admitting the claim of the Jowasimis of the Arab coast to those islands, as against^ the claim of the Jowasimis ol Lingah It was decided that the Chief should be advised to hoist his flag on lamb as on Abu Musa, and this was done. 19 ; T ? fL 1 1 ? 0i ‘L vice l'° y tele graphed that the Belgian Customs officials had placed guards on Abu Musa and Tamb, forcibly removed the Arab flags erected new flagstaffs and hoisted the Persian flag on both is ands. ibis action led to immediate protest by the Sheikh of Sharonh who appea ed to His Majesty’s Government, under his treaty relations wkh them, to take the necessary steps to prevent such interference in his territory. 2°. The Government of India, who took a serious view of the incident proposed - to despatch a gunboat to the islands, with a representative of the iJieikh of Shargah on board, to haul down the Persian flag, reinstate the Jowasimi flag and remove the guards to Persian territory. It was decided t howevei, to give the I ersian Government the opportunity to withdraw from the position they had taken up, and on the 24th May the Minister reported5 that they had telegraphed orders to Bushire to remove the flags and guards from A bn Musa and Tamb, while reserving their right to discuss with His Majesty’s Government the respective claims to the island. Their Note.f however, stated that Persia considered “ these two islands as its property.” and proposed that “neither party ’ should hoist flags in them pending .■settlement of the question. 21. 1 he Note of reply sent to the Persian Government on 15th June 1.904, while expressing willingness to transmit to the Government of India any proofs that the claims of Persia to the ownership of these islands outweighed those of the Sheikh 0 f Shargah, stated that the suggestion that the Sheikh of Shargah should not be permitted to replace his flag, hauled down by the Persian Customs officials, could not be accepted, and went on : “I would remind you, in this connection, that we have not insisted on the Persian Government removing their flag from the island of Sirri till the controversy between the two Governments as to the ownership of the island, which originated many years ago, has been reciprocally settled. The position would have been different if the Sheikh of Shargah had removed an existing flag from Tamb and Abu Musa; what he did was to hoist his own flag upon the islands, which were not yet formally occupied by any other Government, and he has the right to fly it as the first occupant until his lawful possession of these islands is disproved.” 22. The Persian flags were removed, and the dowasimi flag of the Chief of Shargah re-hoisted in June 1904. No serious attempt was made by Persia to produce proof of Persian ownership, 0 and the discussion lapsed, though in 1905 a complaint by Persia of the erection of new buildings at Tamb by the Sheikh of Shargah was investigated and found to be baseless.f 23. The opportunity was taken to make it clear to Persia that the status of Sirri was still sub judice, a view in which she acquiesced, and the Persian Government were warned in 1905 that “ the revival of their claim to Tamb meant the revival of ours to Sirri.” V.—Status of Sirri, 1909. 24. The question of granting a concession to mine red oxide on Sirri having arisen in 1908-9, 14is Majesty’s Government, after consultation with the Government of India, informed^ a British firm that, while the status of the island was in dispute, they had never acquiesced in the Persian claim to dispose of concessions on it regardless of Great Britain ; and the Minister at Teheran presented a protest to the Persian Government in April 1909 against their action in granting a concession, in which he reminded them of the caveat entered by His Majesty’s Government and asked them to arrange foi the discontinuance of operations on the island by their concessionnaire.§ VI.- 1912 3 : Erection of a Lig’hthouse on Tamb Island.

Early in 1912 it was decided to erect and maintain a lighthouse on Tamb Island.[j With the approval of His Majesty’s Government no communication on the subject was made to Persia,|f but the Political Resident, Sii 1 ercy Cox, was authorised to obtain the consent of the Sheikh of Shargah, which was granted by the Sheikh subject to an assurance that his rights of sovereignty were not affected.ff Sir Percy Cox, in writing to the Sheikh, added that while it was desirable that the Shargah flag should always be en evidence on Tamb, “now at all events this island will be preserved for you by the mere presence of the lighthouse.” 26. In October 1912, in reply to an enquiry by the Governor of the Oulf Ports, Sii' Percy Cox stated^t that, with the concurrence of the Sheikh of Shargah, a light was about to be erected there.

In February 1913 the Persian Foreign Office raised the question with the Minister at Teheran, urging that the ownership of the island was contested by Persia. Sir Percy Cox, on reference being made to him, intimated§§ that he had recently made it clear to the Governor of the Gulf Ports that the ownership ol Famb was not open to question, and added that “since the correspondence of 1905 the subjects of the Sheikh of Shargah and Ins flag huAe lemained established on the island } that if the question was now reopened His Majesty s Government would no doubt revive the question of S 1111 , but that a flat refusal to discuss it would probably be best. ^ till F.O. to 1.0., July 3 1913, P. 2647/13. 28. The matter does not appear to have been taken further by Persia.

It may be lemarked at this stage that in the lengthy negotiations which took place with the German Government between 1907 and 1914 over the claim of Messrs. M onckhaus in respect of the cancellation of their red oxide concession in Abu Musa by the Sheikh of Shargah, no reference was made to the Persian Government, who were, indeed, privately reminded by the Charge d’Affaires in 1908 of the incident of 1904, and warned against any attempt to renew the Persian claim/- His Majesty’s Government con sistently referred, in their communications to the German Government, to the “sovereignty ” exercised in Abu Musa by the Sheikh, and a quantity of local evidence was produced to show that the ownership of Abu Musa vested in the ruling Sheikh of the Jowasimi of Oman residing at Shargah.j' It c • v would clearly have been impossible for His Majesty’s Government to have dUTiVi r tl taken the very definite line actually taken by them vis-d-vis Germany had r. 4859/n. the status of the island been, in their view, a matter at all open to dispute. -* Teh tel. 6 to F.O Jan. 6 1908. t Cp. e.g. Memo, to German Govt, under Sir E.

The Minister made the required communication to the Prime Minister, making, however, no reference to Tamb in his Aide Memoire. His Highness made no reply on the matter of Abu Musa.|| Ten days later a Note asserting Persian rights over both Tamb and Abu Musa, “ of which notification was made to His Majesty’s Legation in the year 1903-4,” having been addressed to the Minister by the Persian Foreign Office, Sir P. I mraine adopted an uncompromising attitude, and returned the Note to the Prime Minister with a strongly worded covering letter. IT It seemed probable that the despatch of the Note was due to ignorance on the part of the Acting Foreign Minister of the communication which had been made to the Prime Minister, and, the position of Ilis Majesty’s Government having been made clear, the incident went no further.15 IX.—Persian Customs Interference at Abu Musa, 1925-6. 32. In the autumn of 1925 the Persian customs authorities sent a launch to Abu Musa which inspected the red oxide and removed one bag. On j^pa^ protest being made, they replied that Abu Musa belonged to Persia. Energetic action was taken at Teheran by His Majesty’s Minister, who reminded the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs of the 1923 correspondence, and subsequently warned him privately that persistence in the Persian claim would make it necessary “to request the Government of India to despatch a ship of war to Abu Musa to uphold the rights of the Sheikh of Shargah.”' : ' ; '‘ The Persian Government withdrew, and the customs ** Teh. Desp. 258 authorities were instructed “ not to take any steps in Abu Musa or Tamb f 92 F 6 - 0 p ’ pending reply from Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding status of these islands.” X.—Reassertion of Persian Claim to Tamb, 1928. 33. In July 1928 a Persian customs launch, which had been operating from Tamb for about two months, seized off the south of the island a Debai dhow carrying passengers to Khassab, on the Arab coast, with a smnll cargo of sugar and dates, and brought it to Lingah, where the cargo was confiscated as smuggled and the passengers imprisoned. The incident created a very serious situation on the Trucial Coast, the Trucial Chiefs being restrained only with difficulty from immediate reprisals; and its possible reactions proved a matter of grave concern to the Government of India. 34. Strong diplomatic representations by His Majesty’s Government at Teheran secured the release of the dhow and its passengers and crew. The cargo remains under seizure, and a claim for compensation has been met by a reiteration of the Persian claim to ownership of Tamb, based, according to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, on a British Note dated 27th July 1888, signed by His Majesty’s Minister under instructions from the Marquess Teh. tei. 250 to of Salisburv, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, communicating a p^ 0 ^ ug - map “recently issued by the Intelligence Department of the War Office” for presentation to the Shah on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government. The Charge d’Affaires has indicated that the argument is unsubstantial, while the fact cannot clearly in itself affect the validity of the Arab claim ; but it is clear that in the forthcoming negotiations with Persia, not only the immediate Tamb incident, on which the Government of India have expressed themselves very strongly, but the position of Abu Musa (and of Sirri) will come up for disposal. XI.—Summary. 35. The effective occupation of Sirri by Persia since 1887, and the tacit acquiescence in that occupation of His Majesty’s Government, make it difficult, if not impossible, at this stage to dispute the Persian claim, though His Majesty’s Government are not estopped by any formal admission on their part from using the Shargah claim to the island for bargaining purposes. 36 36. The position is different as regards Tamb and Abu Musa. At no stage has the Persian claim been formally admitted, and at no stage has it been allowed to pass unquestioned. The argument in support of the latest Persian claim as set out in para. 34 above could be strengthened, so far as it has any value, by reference to the fact that the islands are also shown in Persian colours on Lord Curzon’s (unofficial) Map of Persia of 1892, and on the Survey of India Map of 1897.While, however, the error in question * Teh tel lo is extremely regrettable from the standpoint of His Majesty’s Government, Viceroy, April 20 it cannot be taken as a formal declaration by His Majesty’s Government of 1&lt; ' )04,1&gt; ‘ 2559 ' + ' their view of the status of the islands, nor, it is suggested, can it be regarded as of substantial importance in view of the consistent repudiation, before and after the dates mentioned, of the Persian claim.1898. 8 37. As regards the merits oi' that claim, the historical summary above shows that the history of the islands prior to 1750 is obscure; that since that date such authority and such effective occupation as there has been has had its source in the Jowasimi Arabs, who between 1750 and 1820‘ exercised in the Gulf a maritime control uncontested by Persia. There is nothing to show that those Arabs, having obtained a footing on the Persian coast, thence derived authority over outlying islands. Probability suggests rather that they carried with them to their new settlement a position in the islands which they already possessed. The fact that a section of these Arab intruders later acquired the status of Persian subjects, and held their authority on the Persian coast in subordination to the Persian Government Pol. Res. to Minister, as local Chiefs or Governors, cannot affect any original rights the Jowasimi Teheran, Dec. 13 tribes on the Arab and the Jowasimi tribes on the Persian littoral may have had in common; an intimate connection appears to have been maintained between the two sections of the tribe, and the islands remained their common property and did not become Persian territory ; nor, the islands being held by a Sheikh only on behalf of the tribes, had an individual power to alienate any sovereign territorial rights which he might enjoy qua ruler of these tribes.t Finally, de facto possession resting with the Jowasimi Arabs of the Trucial Coast, it would appear to be for Persia, in the absence of evidence at any stage of effective Persian occupation or of acknowledgment by the Trucial Arabs of Persian overlordship in the islands, to prove the case for alteration of the status quo. 38. As between TIis Majesty’s Government and the Trucial Chiefs concerned, the latter, under their treaty engagements, are entitled to the protection of His Majesty’s Government and are not themselves allowed to communicate or negotiate direct with any foreign Power. Apart from the fact that their claim to the islands has consistently been upheld by Ilis Majesty’s Government, it was on the initiative of His Majesty’s Government that the Jowasimi Sheikh of Shargah and Ras-ai-Khaima hoisted his flag on Tamb and Abu Musa in 1903 (see paras. 17 and 18 above). 39. The satisfactory disposal of the matter is important in view of its immediate reactions on the Trucial Coast, and the wider reactions on Mohammedan feeling in India of disturbance in that region. But its importance from its possible reactions on the relations of the Trucial Chiefs with Ibn Sand is hardly less great. G. L.

The recent reassertion by the Persian Government of their claim to the islands of Tamb and Abu Musa, coupled with their refusal to recognise as independent the Sheikh of Pas-al-Khaima on the Trucial Coast, or the claim of His Majesty’s Government under their treaty engagements to protect the Trucial Sheikhs, 0 and Mr. Parr’s report 00 ' as to the extreme # Teh - teI - 259 ^ sensitiveness of Persia at the present time about her authority in the islands, llfu, suggest the desirability of a clear understanding in connection with the f.o., July 27 ms. deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee as to the status of the more important islands in the Gulf other than Tamb, Little Tamb, Abu Musa and Sirri, which are dealt with in the Memorandum on page The present Note, accordingly, deals with the following groups of islands:—• (a) M at ba, Pubiyan, Maskan, bailakah, Auhah, Ivubbar, Qaru, Umm-el- Maradin, which lie off the coast of Koweit and the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab. (b) Kishm, Men jam, Ormuz, Laruk, Sheikh Shuaib, Haiderabi, Kais, Farm- (and Little or Nabiyu Farur), which lie off the south Persian coast, and the position of which came under discussion before and during the war. (c) The Bahrein Archipelago. (d) flalul, Dalmah, Sir Beni Yas, Sir Abu Nair, Qran, Jinnah, Kharag, Khargu. A.—Bubiyan, Failakah, Auhah, Kubbar, Qaru, Umm-el-Maraclin. These islands were before the war in Turkish possession. They were attributed to the administrative control of the Sheikh of Koweit in the (unratified) Anglo-Turkish Convention of 29th July 1913, and were occupied by the Sheikh on the outbreak of war with Turkey in November 1914. They w c er r e L foimally recognised by His Majesty’s Government as forming part ol His Excellency’s dominions in April 1923 (see Koweit Memorandum para. 35, on page (JJ). No Persian claim to these islands can reasonably be preferred. B— Sheikh Shuaib, Kishm, Henjam, Ormuz, Laruk, Hinderabi, Kais, Farur, Nabiyu or Little Farur. I he status of Henjam is examined in greater detail in 'paras. 5 and 6 of the Memorandum on Henjam on p. With the exception of Nabiyu or Little barur, these islands appear to be indisputably Persian; and in 1914 Hi.-' Majesty s Government made a formal offer to the Persian Government to lease or purchase all except Hinderabi, Kais, and Farur.| In 1918, when the renewal of this offer was under consideration, the addition of the three last-named islands to the lists to be communicated to Persia was approved.^ Nabiyu Farur. . 7 Tlie st f tus of Nabiyu or Little Farur is not formally determined The island, which is uninhabited, and lies about 10 miles south-west of the southern extremity of Farur Island, is circular in shape and about half a mile in diameter. The Persian Government were stated in 190G§ “ as yet ” to have paid no attention to it; the Government of India and the India Office m 1903 expressed the viewj| that, on the analogy of Little Tamb, it should be regarded as depending from Farur, “which admittedly belonged to Persia ” and the foreign Office did not dissent from this view. Ihe question was again raised in 1924 in connection with a proposal to erect a light on the island. The Political Resident then suggested that the precedent of Little Jamb was not necessarily binding on His Majestv’s Government, adding: “ We have precise facts that Nabiyu Farur isa barren rock, useless, and not claimed by anyone, and that in 1875 the Farur Sudanis 3063 75 10.28 t Teh. Desp. to F.O., Dec. 12 1914, P. 5098/14. t F.O. tel. 137 to Teheran. Mar. 8 1918, P. 1024/18. § Lor. ii, 584.

Mar. 26 1924,P. 839/24. were recognised as belonging to the Jowasim Tribe of Trucial Oman.” No reference to the incident of 1875 could be traced by the India Office ; but the Secretary of State for India agreed with the Government of India that it would be undesirable to start the erection of a lighthouse on the island without prior intimation to Persia, and the matter was not pursued. It would appear therefore that there is little question that the island must be regarded as Persian, though a slight element of doubt as to a Jowasimi claim exists. C.—The Bahrein Archipelago. The archipelago consists of the islands of Bahrein, Muharraq, Umm Na’assan, Sitrah, and Nabi Salih, and a number of lesser islets and rocks forming part of the same compact geographical group. The archipelago is under the rule of the Sheikh of Bahrein, and the status of Bahrein governs the status of all the other islands composing it. D.—Farsi, Arabi, Harqus; Halul, Dalmah, Shura-awah, Sir Beni Yas, Sir Abu Nair, Qran, Jinnah, Kharag, Khargu. The status of these islands is important, not merely because of the claims which may be urged to them by the Trucial Chiefs, to whom His Majesty’s Government are under treaty obligations, but because their control is in many cases of importance in connection with the policing of the pearl banks, for which responsibility has been assumed by His Majesty’s Government, and because of the possible value of certain of them in connection with an air route along the north Arabian coast.

Farsi is an uninhabited island about a quarter mile across, in the middle of the Gulf, about halfway between Musallamiyah Bay in Hasa and the Tangistan district in south Persia. Arabi is 15 miles south of Farsi; and Harqus, “ a mere sandbank,” 30 miles west of it. Oil seepages were alleged in 1914 (Engler’s “ Petroleum ”) to exist in the sea near all three islands, and Arabi carries a deposit of guano. The ownership of all three islands was stated in the Persian Gulf Gazetteer to be undetermined, Mr. Lorimer adding in the cases of Arabi and Harqus that the question had never arisen. The India Office in 1914 expressed the view, 0 which the Foreign Office did not contest, that His Majesty’s Government should eventually claim the right to deal with all three islands (as with Halul); and beacons were at the same time erected on them with the concurrence of Admiralty and Foreign Office.| No steps were, however, in fact ever taken to regularise the status of the islands, which geographically would most easily have been assigned to Koweit. Halul. An island 1 mile in diameter, some 61 miles E.N.E. of Dohak in the Trucial Principality of El Katr, surrounded by pearl banks, and having in t Lor. n, &lt;&gt;i7. its neighbourhood, under the sea, an intermittent spring of bitumen.J In 1906 there were rumours, which proved unfounded, of German designs to acquire the island from the Porte for use as a coaling station, for which purpose the Government of India stated that it was not unsuitable. Lorimer’s Political Gazetteer (1906) described the status of the island as “ indeterminate ; the pearl divers and fishermen both of El Katr and of Trucial Oman are in the habit of resorting to it; and, so far as can be learnt, no exclusive or preferential rights are claimed by any of the classes § Lor. ii, 6i&amp;. who use it, or by any territorial Chief.”§ In 1908 the India Office, after consultation with the Viceroy, suggested to the Foreign Office that it was preferable to take no action which might lead to discussion of the status of the island, as “ any assertion of rights beyond the present customary usage . . . by Arabs from Bahrein, the Trucial Coast and El Katr, might lead to claims being raised by the El Katr Sheikhs to which the Turkish IO toF&lt;) Dec 2 Govern . ment [suzerain of Katr till 1916, since when the Sheikh has been 1908 ,'f° 2 iii.’ ° C ‘ recognised as an independent Trucial Chief] might lend their support.”]In 1913 Sir Percy Cox, then Political Resident, reported the discovery of correspondence of 1869 from which it appeared that, one of the Shatt-al- Arab buoys having gone adrift and been thrown up on Halid Island, reference was made apparently as a matter of course to the Trucial Sheikh of Abu Dhabi as overlord of the island, 0 and in 1914 His Majesty’s Government authorised! the erection of a beacon on Halul for political as distinct from navigational reasons, and, to quote the Resident, with a view to “ enabling us to keep a footing there as a political precaution.” (Cp. para. 10 of Memorandum on Lighting and Buoying on p. JjJ.) As in the case of Farsi, Arabi and Harqus, the India Office in 1914 recommended that His Majesty’s Government should eventually claim the right to deal with Halid,! no steps were in fact taken for the regularisation of its status. This accordingly remains indeterminate, the available evidence appearing to point to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi as the owner, or failing him one of the other Arab rulers of the Trucial Coast, including the Sheikh of El Katr. There is no history of a Persian claim. The bitumen spring makes the question one of some potential importance. Dalmah. An island 5 miles long and 2|- miles wide, off the coast of the Trucial Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi, close to several pearl banks, and of importance in the pearling season. The Government of India and the India Office agreed in 1908 that the island was undoubtedly under the Trucial Sheikh of Abu Dhabi.§ Siu Beni Yas. An island rather over 100 miles \V. by S. of Abu Dhabi Town, 18 miles E.S.E. of Dalmah Island, and 4 or 5 miles north of the coast of Dhafrah ; described by Lorimer as forming with the islands of Zirko, Arzanah, Daiyinah, Qarnain, Solali, and Das,l| part of the domains of the Trucial Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. All the islands in question are in the vicinity of pearl banks. There is no history of a rival claim. The island is of importance as affording “ an ideal aerodrome, good anchorage ... a good cold weather . . . certainly the best harbour at present existing in the Gulf,”*[ and Sir Lionel Haworth has suggested that it should be purchased from the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi for about £3,000, or alternatively leased, in connection with an air route along the north Arab coast. 00 Shura-Awah. A very small island in the neighbourhood of two pearl banks, lying in the bay between Abu Dhabi and Qatar, about 34 miles N. by W. of Dalmah. Its political position is described by Lorimer as apparently “ indeterminate, resembling that of Halul Island.”!! Sir Abu Nair. An island, not permanently inhabited, miles long by 2 miles broad, about 50 miles N. by W. of the Trucial Arab town of Abu Dhabi, and 65 miles west of Dibai; containing salt deposits, alleged to contain deposits of sulphur, and in the neighbourhood of pearl banks.!! On the occasion of tbe Persian attempt on Tamb and Abu Musa in 1904, the Sheikh of Shargah represented to the Political Resident that “ the British Government are aware of the fact that the islands of Tamb, Abu Musa, and Sir (meaning Sir Abu Nair) ” belonged to him.§§ The salt in the island was stated in the Persian Gulf Gazetteer!)j| to have been “removed by Persians, chiefly from Lingah and Kung, on payment of dues to tbe Sheikh of Shargah ” until “ some two years ago” (say 1904). The India Office in 1908 accepted Mr. Lorimer’s view T , as expressed in the Gazetteer, that the island belonged to the Sheikh of Shargah,^ and in 1913, on the suggestion of Sir Percy Cox, the statement in the “Persian Gulf Pilot ” that the island “ is claimed by the A1 Jowasim Chief” was replaced by the words “belongs to the principality of Shargah.” 000 Qran or Kran.
