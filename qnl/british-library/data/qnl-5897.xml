Bear Mr. Ijaithwaite, {Forgive rae, if i/fiave not your present mode of address correct, have no books of reference by me). 1 have,.received your confidential letter No. P*Z.338€f733 about the Shaikh of-Kowei^s date-gardens near Basra. So far as I remember, there was not issued during my time any order by the Army Commander specifying the Kevenue Commissioner’s duties, in fact I think that I was opposed to the issue of any such order at the beginning, since my work then included such a medley of Turkish Departments of which we scarcely knew the names and included the Judicial Department, I do, however, remember distinctly that a special order was issued about the reopening of the Tapu Department, which had been closed, I think, from the beginning of the War until April 1915. If this order cannot be found in the files of orders by the Army Commander, it is practically certain to have been published in the Basra Times, since I remember that I made special efforts to give the greatest possible publicity to the fact of the reopening. It is possible that this order will be found to include a specification of the powers of the Revenue Commissioner in relation to Tapu operations. It would of course be a general disaster to the inhabitants of Basra, were the Tapu Powers of the Revenue Commissioner in 1915 and 1916 now to be successfully challenged, since immense arrears of applications for Tapu/s Tapu Transfers had accumulated under the Turks and I worked them off pretty rapidly, enquiring into and signing some thousands of transfers. Many titles would be invalidated and there would be general discontent. I can hardly believe that the Iraq Oovemment would choose now to adopt such a course. Yours sincerely, (Bgd). H. IX)BBS. *» J.

P.S.3380/33. Dear Sir Henry DoLLs, I hope you. will forgive me if I Pother you about a difficult point which has arisen in connection with the assurances in respect of their date gardens in Iraq which were given to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah in 1914 in return for their assistance at the beginning of the War. There has recently been an effort to challenge the title of the Sheikh of Koweit to certain of the date gardens possession of which was guaranteed to him in 1914,on the ground that his title was never properly registered. As you will remember, the title was not registered before the War because the Turkish Government would agree to registration only on condition that the Sheikh declared himself a Turkish subject, which, on our advice and at our request, he was unwilling to do. 2 / Henry Dobbs, GBE., KCSI., KCMG., KCIE. Camphire, Cappoquin, Go.Waterford.2* In 1915 a tapu deed of registration in respect ox the property now in dispute was granted to tiie Sheikh by you as Revenue Commissioner. The grant was admittedly not in accordance with the Ottoman Law and for this and other various technical reasons it has been argued that the deed of registration was void ab initio , lou may, in this connection, care to see the copy which I enclose of your letter of 14th June 1915 to the Agent of the Sheikh of Koweit. W es ^ on is being further investigated here. We are, however, at this stage inclined to think that if as we presume was the case, the Revenue Coma as loner was authorised to register property in tapu by virtue of one ox the proclamations, articles or laws referred to in Part VIII of the Iraq Constitution, of which I enclose a copy, and if, in registering the Sheikh's estate he uia not act in contravention of or exceed the authority conferred upon him, it should be possible to defend the legality of the registration, it seems to us possible that in carrying out the registration of this property and others your action as Revenue Commissioner was taken under the general authority of some Amy proclamation or order which authorised you in that capacity to carry out transactionstransactions of this character. We have traced a reference in Army Orders (reproduced from the Gazette of India) to your appointment (on 36th January 1915) as Revenue Commissioner, hut we have teen unable (the papers both here and in the historical section of the C.I.D. are very confused and there are many gaps in them) to find any corresponding order indicating the nature of the duties which fell to be performed by the Revenue Commissioner, 4. If by any chance you remember after this long interval whether tnere was in fact any formal proclamation or order by the Army Commander specifying the Revenue Commissioner’s duties, we should be most grateful if you could let us know. Sir Percy Cox, whom we consulted, tells me that he was not actually in Basra at the time of the appointment of the Revenue Commissioner and that though he has a strong recollection that there was some oraer of the type m question, he lias been unable so far to trace it. Sir Arnold Wilson has a very definite recollection that some notification appeared in Force Orders, but here again we have not so far succeeded in finding one. If your recollection is that there was any Army proclamation or order defining or referring to the nature/nature of your unties, we will renew our search, since ii tne unties defined included property registration witnout stipulating that registration must he in accordance with tne old Ottoman Law, then it might greatly strengthen our hands in considering that xo.ru /xlI of the Iraq Constitution could he considered ao validating your registration of the Sheikh*s property. 5. I need not say how grateful we shall he for any assistance you can give us on this rather difficult and controversial point, about which I trust you will forgive me for bothering you.

I spoke to His Excellency the Shaikh about giving you a definite fee for conducting the Faddaghiyah Case, quite apart from the £100/- a year which you receive as a retainer*. He promised me that he had every intention of doing so, and would reward you handsomely too* His Excellency said that he had mentioned to you himself that IS as soon as the case ^as about to come into Court officially, he would come to a direct arrangement with you as to what fees he should pay, also that he had told you to come and see him about the matter* I advise you, therefore, to either write or see the Shaikh as sofen as the Court fix the date for hearing the case, and explain your 'terms' to him* Do not delay too long* As you know the Shaikh has not to date given authority you wwytkiig to accept any 'service' of documents, summonses etc on his behalf. This the Shaikh did on the advice of His Majesty’s Government given through me.

I hare the honour to inform you that when the Hon*ble Lieut-Colonel Fowle was here recently (July) on his way through to the United Kingdom, His Excellency the Shaikh told him and me that he had heard from his Lawyer (Mr. Gabriel of Messrs Arteen and Yacub) in Basra that the 'Original Power of Attorney ' given by Aishah bint Abdullah Chelabi as-Zuhair to her husband Ahmad Pasha al- Zuhair empowering him to sell the Faddaghiyah Estate for her had been found in Constantinople and was now in his (the Lawyer’s) possession in Basra.-( 2 )- It appears that the enterprising lawyer, not content with getting us to move in the matter through the British Ambassador at Angora, had him self also sent a trusty man armed with the necessary 'gold* to see what he could do in the Constantinople 'Somerset House”. He was apparently quite success ful, and was able to get the original document for the sum of £50. 4. The production of this very valuable document puts an entirely new complexion on the Faddaghiyah Law Suit which is to be filed shortly. July) the question of this document was fully dis cussed with H.M* s Charge d’Affaires, Mr. Nihill (Legal Secretary) and Mr. Stafford (Finance Secre tary) and I was asked to get a copy from Mr.Gabriel of Arteen and Arcoob (Yacub) . This I am doing. I was also asked to give certain other messages to Mr. Gabriel, which I duly delivered verbally and by letter on my return to Kuwait on 5rd August. private information that the Iraq Courts would find some way very soon, of serving their suimnons on the shaikh, and that the Faddaghiyah case would then come up for hearing somewhere on or before the 15th September 1933. and to this end had told the Shaikh not to accept service himself or authorise his Lawyers to do so. The production of the lost ' Power of Attorney ' has now he said so sompletely altered the situation in the Shaikh’s favour, that there was now really no 5.

In fact this was a desirable move. *7* I agree with Mr. Nihill’s views, and while warning Mr. Gabriel W ready his defence, I have told him I would see about getting instruc tions from His Majesty’s Government permitting me to tell the Shaikh that he could now with safety go ahead and authorise his lawyers to defend the case when it comes forward. 8. I much regret that I did not inform you about the recovery of the Power of Attorney before, but I went down with fever during Colonel Fowle’s visit here, and was laid up for some days after he went. Then came my hurried visit to Baghdad which prevented my attending to much important work that was awaiting me. I should be grateful now if you would raise the point I have mentioned in paragraph 7 above with His Majesty’s Government and could authorise me &amp;o tell the Shaikh that he can now with safety empower his Basra Lawyers to accept Service' on his behalf and get ready to defend his interests.

Mr.Stafford J h % &amp; i to the Charge d f Affaires dated the 28th July 1935 and the draft letter which it was proposed should be sent to the Prime Minister of Iraq. that the word TT sabotage” should be omitted from this letter as likely to complicate matters. It was also agreed that if possible I should personally discuss the matter with the Prime Minister, before presenta tion of the letter, and to this end the Prime Minister was invited to dine with Mr. Ogilvie Forbes the following night (Sunday). The same evening I met Mr. Edmonds, Acting Adviser to the Ministry of Interior and talked over the Shaikh 1 s difficulties. 3. On Sunday the 50th July * Gailani, as arranged, and after dinner was given an opportunity of having a private talk with him. The Prime Minister was extremely cordial and affable and showed pleasure and surprise at the ease with which I agreed with Mr. Stafford’s suggestion I met the Prime Minister, H.E. Raschid AliI was able to speak his language* This possibly Id him to ’open his heart” in the rather surprising way he did. He quiSe candidly and openly discussed (i) King Bin Saud and his affairs (ii) King Faisal’s aspirations (iii) Shaikh of Kuwait’s troubles. At the same time it is only fair to say that he several times remarked that what he told me were his personal views only, and that he did so because he saw that I was a lover of the Arab and so felt sympathetically inclined towards me. As regards (i) the Prime Minister opined that Bin Saud was very near being on the rocks, and that unless he took a pull at himself the 'crash* would soon come. He was bankrupt and the recent Asir Campaign had just about given him his 'coup de grace'. His stupid and cruel treatment of the great Kajd tribes had alienated the affections of every one throtighaut Arabia. All his people were quietly and patiently awaiting the end. He particularly clamed Bin Baud’s false and traitorous (his words) Egyptian and Cyrian advisers, who were only playing for themselves and not for Bin Baud* With the death of Bin Saud he saw complete chaos, and then Iraq, Transjordan, Kuwait, etc., would come into their own. He blamed His Majesty’s Government for allowing Bin Saud so much rope, ©specially in his dealings with the U.S.S.B., and emphasised that the Amir Faisal’s visit to Moscow was not the innocent one that His Majesty’s Government supposed* Bin Saud was deliberately trying to play off Moscow against London, and would go on dping so by means of other foreign powers also. He was severely critical of His Majesty’s Government for allowing(3)- u Bin Saud to go on blockading KiBiait as h© was doing, and opined that Kis Majesty’s Govermaent had only to 'turn her face' from Bin Saud or sinply threaten to do this, for Bin Saud to ' come to hoel 'at once. Be was an Arab and understood a fesllow Arab better than His Majesty’s Government, and if only His Majesty’s Government would firmly tell Bin Saud, once and for all, to stop bullying Kuwait, why the results would be surprising: (This remark amused me not a little)• Bin Saud knew better than any one that it was His Majesty 1 s Government alone who saved him during the Akhwan rebellion and the more recent Ibn Bifada trouble. He Bin Saud knew that if we were to withdraw our good will, then all the tribes in Arabia would at once break out into revolt. Bin Saud only kept them quiet by preaching that His Majesty’s Government was under an obligation to him and would come to his help against his own people if need be. As regards (ii). The Hrime Minister opined that King Faisal was England’s real friend, and not Bin Saud, for Faisal knew and penalised that he could not stand without His Majesty’s Government’s continuous help. This being so His Majesty’s Government should have more confidence in Faisal and allow him to widen his territories, in opposition to Bin Saud who was not a friend but really an enemy of England, as we should some day see. Everyone knew that neither Kuwait nor Transjordan could dtand alone economically or other wise, what better than to allow Iraq to absorb both^ by means of fair and suitable treaties. This would not mean the removal of Amir Abdullah or Shaikh AhmadAhmad , botli would, retalu tbair personal powers, and oontinue 'to iuzi tlie jLriliexixal aduiinistiiratiioii of their stages wiHiout interference» All that the head state Iraq would be responsible for would be their Foreign Policy. The Prime Minister then asiced if I did not agree with this view, but I fear received only a laughing and non-committal answer. M..regards (ill) Kuwait, The Prime Minister expressed much sympathy with the Shaikh over the question of the Istahlah tax, and said that he had heard confi dentially from London that the matter would shortly be settled satisfactorily to both Iraq and Kuwait. T , , Iraq would waive all her past revanjte, and His :*ajesty’s Government would pay Kuwait's share of all future land revenue to Irqq. He said nothing about the Faddaghiyah or Bashigeh cases, but asked what the Shaikh had thought of King Faisal, and his recep tion in .Baghdad last year. He emphasised how much he personally had liked the Shaikh and was most # impressed with his courtly and charming bearing. He knew also that Faisal thought the same as himself* It was here tiiat 1 thought the opportunity an excellent one to open the question of the Shaikh’s Fao property and tho communistic trouble that was going on there, fuis I did in detail, giving it as my opinion that the fellaheen had got out of hand either because of some interested and unknown parsons intrigue, or because the long delay in the settlement of the Bashigeh and Faddaghiyah cases which every one believed would eventually be taken from the Shaikh had encouraged the fellaheen to think that they might be successful also in getting a slice from the Shaikh’s estates if they made enough noise. I then quoted the Bedouin proverb 'when the camel is down out comes everybody’s knives” which pleased thethe Prime Minister, The rime Minister expressed great surprise that s 1 ch a situation had been allowed to arise, and especially that he had not been told about it. He promised to take immediate action in the matter and said he 3js% would telegraph to the Mutasarrif Basra, and order him to get am to the trouble at once. I pointed out that the Shaikh was mo&amp;t averse to doing anything that might be construed by the local Government as 'irritating the situa tion”, so had not sent as yet any naturs to watch the date crops, as is customary each year, I suggested that as the Mutasarrif had definite machinery for settling disputes between landlord and fellah, it should be put into motion and the trouble would cease. He agreed and thanked me for telling me about the matter and asked me to give his compliments to the Shaikh and tell him not to be anxious about the final result. I here thanked the Prime Minister and our talk ended. I *iave given the Prime Minister’s ta3.k somewhat at length as it may bo found of interest although I quite realise that what he said did not cenoern the business I was on, 31 at July . I had another meeting with Mr. Stafford and Mr. NiMH. The Paddaghiyah case was discussed and especially the recovery of the 'Power of Attorney” which Aisha gave to her husband, authorising him to sell the Faddaghiyah to Shaikh Mubarak. It was agreed that the obtain ing of this document put a complete new complexion on the matter. I was asked (a) to obtain a copy of-( 6 ) iftf - &gt; of the Power of Attorney for the Embassy and (b) to warn the Shaikh and Mr# Gnbriel (Lawyer) that the Basra Courts would rind a way or serving a summons shortly on him, either by registered letters or by publishing it in the Basra papersp# (c) To tell Mr* Gakriel to prepare to file his defence before the 15th September, as there was evidence to show that the ease would come off about then# (d) I was further asked to obtain from Mr* Gatriel all the names of the living heirs of Aiysha. Mr. Hihiil gave it as his opinion that His Majesty’s (xovernment’s delaying action had been very helpful and that now there was no longer any reason why the Shaikh should avoid defending the case when it came forward. I agreed and promised to get all the information he wanted* Qa Monday the Slat July (Noon) . At the suggestion of Mr. Ggilvie Forbes, I went and saw Mr# Honk, acting Director General of Customs, regarding the alleged excessive contraband that was passing from Kuwait into Iraq. I found Mr# Monk not particularly helpful at first. His attitude, I feai*, was that of the Englishman who has become more XHA^I than the real article. Kuwait was the sinner and must be punished. Iraq was the poor suffering innocent party, struggling to do the right thing. Kuwait must be brought to her senses, either by the method of depriving her of her drinking water from the 8hatt-al-Arab, or by a policy of super frightfullness on all and sundry caught smuggling. That is to say by shoot ing out of hand any person so caught. Mr. Monk’s final contribution for the solution to the problem waswas for His Majesty’s Government to force Kuwait to raise her Customs duties to the same level as that of Iraq. This he assured me could and would be done sooner than I expected# After patiently hearing to all he had to say, I pointed out that (a) Kuwait was not hostile to Iraq as he seemed to think, (b) that the Shaikh was taking all precautions in his power to stop smuggling but had difficulties of finance, etc. (o) hat Iraq were apparently under a serious delusion as to the amount of contrabdnd that went from Kuwait. In reality the traffic was not great and the Bedouins were the chief culprits, but that they^were most o.ifficult to catch, seeing that they came in from all quarters of the desert and bought only in small quantities and ostensibly for themselves# ^ (d) I suggested that the Iraq Customs Department should really make some effort themselves to place Customs Posts on the 100 miles of Kuwait-Iraq land frontier. They had a single immobile post A^agwan, which merely watched the Basra - Kuwait motor road, but that 80 miles of frontier was without a single post nor was a patrol ever sent along the Batin from Sa^wan to Rigai. In fact the door was entirely open, and the Bedouins had no difficulty in crossing into Iraq whereever and when::ever they wanted. {©) I suggested that the Iraq Customs would do well to place 4 Customs posts on this Batin line, instead of trying by a tUA-A. process of frightfulness $o bluff to get Kuwait to do their work for them. (f) I pointed out that the Bhaikh of Kuwait’s point of view could be put in a nutshell. He was sympathetic and would always do his best to oooperate, but Iraq must herself watch-( 8 )- watch her own frontiers. It was not Kuwait*s business to do this. (g) Lastly I pointed out that with Bin Baud’s Customs duties averaging 150$ ad valorem and Iraq’s averaging some 60$ it was obvious that 90$ of the contraband trade would go into Saudi Arabia, for clearly the profits were so much greater, Kuwait’s whole policy was to break Bin Baud’s Blockade, whether by sea or land. They had a definite quarrel with Bin Saud but none with Iraq. (h) Kconclusion I suggested with some diffidence that the Iraq Customs should be qi^jeful not to swallow all the stories of the many Fao and Zubair sp|ros who they employed. These men had to live, and good information meant good pay. (i) I think I was able to make Mr. Monk see a little of Kuwait’s point of view before I left. On Wednesday the £nd August . I had a full and frank discussion with Ir, Stafford with regard to my discussions with Mr, Monk. I think I was able to clear up much that was not understood before. In particular I believe I was ablo to convince Mr. Stafford that the so called 'Contraband' running from Kuwait to Iraq was nothing like as serious as the Iraq Government tried to make out. I offered the suggestion that perhaps it was part and parcel of the Shatt al Arab gardens business, and might not be unconnected with the Iraq Government’s desire to get control of Kuwait- 7. I returned to Kuwait by air on 5rd August.

He is of the opinion that the court would not consider an application for mesne profits owing to the fact that,the claimante 1 right of action has been open to thew for years poet. and. accordingly, they mist be held to have acquiesced in cultivation by th« Bhaikh during the period in tdiioh they might have brought their claim btit did not d© so. As regards (n) # there!s no precise mraltel In ’Iraq procedure to a stay of execution. In both the toahiyah nd !%ddnghiyah suits, however, the Bhaikh would appear to have plenty of time to nroeeeu+e hie counter claim. In the first place, it would appear almost impossible for the Bhnlkh to lone possession of either estate until all the clafmnnls have obtained judgment in their favmir. As regards the Hash!yah case the position at the moment is that one claim**'* *»»**«* has established her claim to approximately one twelfth of that portion of the ^aehi^ah estate concerning idiicb the Bhaikh’s title is in doubt. Other claimants have filed suits covering the remainder of the disputed area, but so far no service bins been effected on the ‘Imikh. Since obtaining judgment, so far as X know, ^sfiah has taken no steps to obtain execution. profits. / it/:w It ie now open to her to enter into an arrangement with the Shaikh for her ahare of the profitn of emiti^mtion. If thin fails she can apply to the court for actual phy»ical di -riaion n of the land. But here her difficulties will begin• ^he court will not C'it off a slice of the eutate approximating to her share and give it to her; on the contrary, the divlolon has to li he one twelfth of every acre, ?^ard, or square in&amp;u With other suite pending concerning ^he property to he divided the Court would almost certainly postpone actual physical division of the land until those suits had heett determined. In the case of the ^addaghlynh estate only one claimant has so far entered an action, Abdullah ibn Isa, and M* claim is as to one third. The same considerations apply here, namely that in practice it would be extremely difficult to oust the Shaikh from possession until adjudication had been completed on claims to the reminder of the property. (b) Mr. Brower is of opinion that the court would not heir a counter claim for a return of the purchase money until Judg ment has been given against the Bhaikh. The Shaikh could of course proceed piecemeal, ffeit ho might claim a proportionate return of the purchase money from Bafiah, assuming thnt he can show her to be an heir of the vendor, or he can wait until Judgment has been given against him on the remaining Bashiyah suits and then proceed against all the successful claimants. Alternatively if he admits the claim both in the Bnshiynh and Baddashivah estates, he would file his counter claim at once. Ho doubt hie beet course of action is to admit nothing and keep his counter claim in reserve. '*h© process of execution in this country works so slowly in normal cases that the chances of the Shaikh losing possession anterior to the determination of his counter claim seem remote.

On the 14th August feeling uneasy about the non receipt of favourable news from Fao, I addressed a short personal note to the Shaikh asking how the situation stood. His Excellency replied the same day (letter ’A* enclosed) and forwarded a letter from his Lawyer (Mr. Gabriel) dated the 11th August (letter 'B* tj enclosed). 6. In view of the Lawyer’s statement that he hoped that the troubles would be ended in two or three days, I called on the Shaikh and advised his waiting another day or two before I took action. He agreed, but pointed out the danger of further delay, as the dates were nearly ripe, and unless the fruit on each tree was assessed, there was nothing to prevent the fellaheen picking and disposing of it themselves. 7. The Shaikh then informed me that he had that morning received a very urgent telegraphic request for I.Dinars 500/- from his Lawyer, which the telegram said was for a very special object . And that trusting his Lawyer he had telegraphed his Bank in Basra to hand-(3)- % hand over the money. 8* On the 16th August the Shaikh sent me a telegram to see from his Lawyer which read 'Orders have gone forth (from the Mutasarrif), and I have instructed the date assessors to proceed to the Fao gardens to estimate the crop at once'# I'he above is the situation as far as is known at present, and I have considered it my duty to let you know how things stand. Whether this troublesome matter can be said to have been finally settled or not, I am not in a position to say. 10. Xjt All along everything has depended on whether the Mutasarrif, Basra, meant business or not. If he honestly intended to settle the trouble he had the necessary machinery at hand, if he did not then / h© could pervaricate and delay matters until the date crop was disposed of by the fellaheen. 11. What made me anxious was the well known anti-English attitude of the Mutasarrif and the fact that he bears the Shaikh a personal grudge of long standing. 12. I will report further progress as I get news. I have the honour to be, Bir, Your most obedient servant, Lt-Colonel, Political Agent,KuwaitENCLOSURE !

Without doubt Baghdad has moved in the matter, and the Mutasarrif has been told pretty plainly to stop the trouble. 7.

There is said to have been some disorder despite an appeal for assistance to the Mudir of Fao. His Majesty’s Embassy have informed the ’Iraqi Government that in view of the special treaty relationship between Great Britain and Kuwait, His Majesty’s Government count upon them to issue immediate instructions to the Mutassarrif of the Basrah Liwa to give the Shaikh’s Agent all support necessary to bring the situation under control.

According to reports which have reached His Majesty’s Government, the fellaheen on the estate in question are engaged in an unlawful endeavour to repudiate the authority of the Shaikh and to rob him of his immemorial rights in the produce of the gardens. It has been reported to His Majesty’s Govern ment th&amp;t the Shaikh’s agent has been threatened and that the loyal fellaheen are being beaten and intimidated Toy the dis affected section. 3. His Majesty’s Government have learnt of these illegal activities with great concern, and they look to the Government of ’Iraq to take immediate action to restore the situation. So far. His Majesty’s Government understand, the efforts of the local officials at Fao have not resulted in checking this dangerous and subversive movement. 4. As the Government of ’Iraq is aware. His Excellency the Huler of Kuwait is in a special treaty relationship with His Majesty’s Government, who regard themselves accordingly as under a particular obligation to safeguard his interests.

Sir, t ’n In continuation of my telegram No.207, dated the 5th September 1955 - Fao Situation - I have the honour to forward fuller details of recent happenings with certain criticisms of my own, from which you will obsefve that the situation has reached an alarming stage chiefly because of the near approach of the time when the dates will be cut. 2. On 30th £«£* August Bis Excellency the Shaikh called on me and reported with some agitation, that just as he thought all was panning out well at Fao, he had received the disquieting news that the ringleaders in the troubles there, had again visited the Mutasarrif at Basra and on returning to Fao, had spread the story every where that he (the Shaikh) was going to be coerced into accepting half shares with the fellaheen, on the produce of his estate, instead of the division being made on the universally accepted basis of 56% to the landlord and 44 % to the fellah. The Shaikh added that he had at once sent a special and trusty messenger to his lawyer, Mr. Gabriel in Basra, to find out what ms in the wind* 3. On 2nd September the Shaikh called on me again and informed me that his messenger had returned bearingbearing two letters from Mr •Gabriel, which confirmed the above story, and baldly asked for instructions. 4# The messenger further brought a confidential verbal report from Mr.Gabriel to himself (the Shaikh)(he clearly was afraid to commit it to writing), the gist of which was that the Mutasarrif had sent for him (the lawyer) and had told him (also verbally) that (a) The Shaikh must divide the produce of his gardens at Fao with his fellaheen on a 50/50 basis and not according to the customary 56/44 per cent basis; (b) That the Shaikh must dismiss his Fao Agent at once. (He is one of the Shaikhs own tenants!. (c) That the Shaikh was not at liberty to send any watchmen to guard the ripening dates as is the custom everywhere. (d) That he, the lawyer, would be held personally responsible that (c) was carried out, (e) That if the Shaikh agreed to (a) and (b) he (the Mutasarrif) would settle his dispute with his fellaheen out of hand, but that if he did not, then he would have nothing further to do with him, and the Shaikh could go to the courts if he chose. He would not help. The message further added that it was now very clear to him (the lawyer) that the Mutasarrif was at the bottom of the whole Fao business and was probably acting under orders, but that he dare not suggest such a thing in writing, last ly that the threatening attitude of the Mutasarrif to him self had made him nervous about his own safety and future career, and he suggested that perhaps the Shaikhs best course was to submit to force majeur^ for an appeal to the courts, seeing that the Shaikh possessed no Tapu deeds, would clearly involve endless litigation, much expense, and prob ably loss through delay of his 1935 date crop. All this, without doubt, the Mutasarrif was fully aware of. 5. On 3rd September the Shaikh sent his Secretary to show me the draft of his reply to Mr.Gabriel. This ranran as follows: Mr•Gabriel to inform tho Mutasarrif that he could not agree to his terras for the following reasons (a) He (the Mutasarrif) had no right to dis- crirainate against him from anjona all 'Iraq landlords by trying to alter the law which fixed the shares of landlord and tenant: (b) He had no ri^it lot introduce the new and highly objectionable suggestion of a division of produce on a new basis, when all he had asked for was protection against half a dozen disturbers of the peace, who were re sisting hie agent and Yictimizing his other fellaheen, 90 per cent of whom were loyal and c on tented men♦ The Shaikh also instructed his lawyer not to allow the case to get into the courts on any account, and refused to comply with the lawyers request for a Power of Attorney to represent him legally where the Fao Estate was concerned. (The lawyer in one of his letters had asked for this.) 6. On 4th September I saw the Shaikh again and he infoimied me that he had just received a widely signed pe tition from his tenants at Fao, deploring the activities of the rebellious minority, and the Mutasarrifs strange way of trying to appease them. They protested their loyal ty and complete readiness to pay their overlord, his share of the date and other crops on the well understood and established basis of 44/56 per cent. 7. It is indeed a matter of great regret to me that just as this troublesome affair appeared to be on the high road to settlement, and which, as far as I can see, presents no real difficulties au oil, the Mutasarrif, Basra, should have thought fit to deliberately enter the lists and spoil everything. 8. On tho plea, no doubt, that he found that the discontented few had a certain amount of right on their side seeing that they were ’'Taab^ tenants who had actually planted the palm, trees and generally had converted what was originally marshy and bad land into good land, he hadhad caused it to become known both among loyal and disloyal fellaheen that he would ccmpel the Shaikh to accept 5&lt;$ of the produce as his share instead of the usual 56%, the remaining SOI, to go to the fellaheen. This action has upset everyone, contented and discontented alike and has gone far to undo all the good work that has recently been done by His Majesty's Chargfe d’affaires wi th the 4 Iraq Government. 9* I cannot but come to the regretful conclusion, and I know Hie :ioellency the Shaikh entirely shares my views, that the Mutasarrif has acted as he has done, with the de liberate Intention of spoiling the settlement, which was in sight, either at the instance of the central Government, or out of personal hostility and desire to hurt the Shaikh. Indeed the attitude of the Mutasarrif bears an all too close resemblance to the methods of officials under the old Turkish regime, who were for ever purposely creating awkward Agrarian situations, as between landlord and eulti- ' vator, in order to make profit by putting things right again for a consideration. 10. Actually, the facts about the landlord and cultivator shares are as follows, in case you are unaware of them:- In Turkish times when the 'Mlr/i* or 'Khums' system was in force, right down to the recent introduction of the 'Istafclak* system of taxation, the law laid it down that the fellah’s share of the date crop and other produce was 40/* and that of the ’’Mallak” (landlord) 60%. This was considered an equitable division seeing that the landlord paid the whole of the landtax of 20% to Government* 11* vVith the introduction of the ’’Istahlak” Law of 2 years ago the ’Iraq Government, I understand, laid it down that the fellah should get 44% of the whole crop and the 'Mallak” 56%. The difference between each party’s share being thus reduced from 20 to 12, because it was recognized thati that while the landlord would pay most of the 'Ashur* tax (10^ tax), the fellah would also sell a portion of his crop, and so would have to pay a certain amount of taxation also* 12. '-’or the Mutasarrif to calmly intimate that the Shaikh should settle with all his fellaheen on a fifty fifty basis (for this is apparently what he meanl) , is not only contrary to the Law, but boars every sign of injustice, seeing that all other garden owners from Qurna to the sea work to-day on the 44/56 basis. 13. You will, no doubt, have observed that tho Muta sarrif has apparently made no attempt to have the matter settled by 'Tribal Majlisss', which is the normal method of settling differences between owner and cultivator and for which official machinery exists. Nor has he suggested as another means of settling the trouble that the Shaikh might get rid of the troublesome half dozen 'Taab* tenants by the f compensatory f method, for which also there is a re gular procedure. Instead he has championed those giving the trouble and has sowed the seed of discord among the contented cultivators by promising things they have no right to expect. Last but not least he has tied the Shaikhs hands by forbidding the sending of watchmen to guard the ripening dates, so as to prevent them being stolen by the fellaheen, a safeguard which is customary throughout the land and is the 'Mallaks' prerogative everywhere. 14. In actual fact this forbidding of watchmen is tentamount to telling the Shaikh that he had better accept the Mutasarrif f s decision quietly or have his dates stolen. The Shaikh recognizes this and is determined not to give way to the threat. He told me that for a day or two he thought of telegraphing to King Faisal and asking him to- 5 - I if ^ 1/ (T£h \ ' / to intervene but later resisted the temptation, as he felt His Majesty's Government were his rightful champions, and in the long run wculd see him through his troubles. 15. It Is a significant fact and one that one cannot shut ones eyes to, that there has never been any trouble between landlord and tenant (Incidentally all are of Uejd origin, and ai'e not ’Iraqis) on the Fao Estate, for six generations, and only when 'Iraq was recently given her independence and started casting covetous eyes on Kuwait, did the Shaikh ever experience any difficulty in the manage ment of his various properties on the Shatt al-Arab. Since then, however, and in three short years, the Shaikh has been faced, in rapid succession, with (a) demands that he should pay taxation on his exempted gardens (enforced); (b) ditto on produce exported for his own household use (enforced); (o) attacks on his 3ashiyeh and Faddaghiyeh Estates; (d) unwarranted allegations regarding contraband running; and now finally with (e) this culminating trouble on his Fao Estate* 16. There can be no doubt at all, in my opinion, al- * though it may not be politsf to say so openly, that these attacks all form part of the carefully planned campaign of the new f Iraq Government, to force Kuwait to come under her control, and protection, by exerting pressure after pressure on the Shaikh, and at the same time by letting it be known 'under the cloak', as the Arabs call it, that all his troubles would cease if only he (the Shaikh) would surrender* The Prime Minister of ’Iraq recently admitted as much to me in private conversation, although he put it in more parliament ary and. subtle language* 17. As Kis Majesty’s Government is vitally interested that the Shaikh should not be deprived of any of his property in ’Iraq and still less lose legitimate revenue from them,—000—— I append below some figures which may be found of interest* They are, of course, approximate only, (a) Size of Fao Estate 6,000 Jeribs.

Sir, With reference to my Saving telegran No .6 of July 20th regarding the outbreak of trouble amongst the fellaheen on the Shaikh of Kuwait’s estates at Eao, I will now summarise the facts given to me by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 2. According to Colonel Dickson, the Political Agent at Kuwait, the fhaikh has received news from his agent at Pao to the effect that the trouble began in the northern half of the Pao property, and then rapidly spread to the southern half. Many acts of sabotage are reported to have taken place, such as the cutting down of trees. About two-thirds of the fellaheen have refused to supply to the Shaikh’s agent the firewood, palm fronds, fruit and fodder which are nomally sent to Kuwait at this time of the year for the use of the chaikh’s household. 3. In reply to the agent’s protests the fellaheen appear to have everywhere given a common form of reply, namely, 'The '’Iraqi Government, not the Shaikh of Kuwait, is our Government; we are the owners of the soil and have been born and bred on it. our Government is going to help us and make us proprietors.® 4. According to the Shaikh, the agent further reported that he had officially complained to the Mu dir of Pao about the behaviour of the fellaheen; that the Mu dir *Mu dir had sent for the headnen and told them that the;/ must behave then selves, and pay the Shaikh quietly and in an orderly manner, but that ao far nothing hod happened. 5. The Shaikh appears, according to Colonel Dickson, to hold the opinion that the Mudir of Fao is himself at the bottom oi the trouble and that he iy acting under the secret and express order oi the Mutasarrlf of Basra. Colonel rick son appears to share this opinion but, in the absence of evidence, I hesitate to acce'pt it. V 1 6. As suggested in my &gt;aving telegram under reference, 1 m\ inclined to regard as highly significant the fact that Mr. Gabriel, the Shaikh's lawyer, foretold these happenings with almost complete exactitude about a month before they occurred. In this connection 1 would refer you to the Political He si den V e despatch to the India Office No.640 of June 10th last. At the sane time, he apparently advised the shaikh to authorise him to take out Tapu deeds, a work of research which, owing to the complexity of the estate, would no ctoubt have provided Mr. Gabriel with profitable occupation. The dhaikh, for various reasons, hesitated to do this. Although it is, 1 adult, only a hypothesis, it is not, 1 consider, unreasonable to suspect that this Armenian lawyer is connected with the Basrah lawyers who are said to be advising the fellaheen. 7. '1th regard to action in ’Iraq, I feel that, for the moment, nothing more can be done than to await the result of the intervention that Major Edr.onds has promised me. meanwhile the shaikh's agent should, of course, seek the aid of the Police and initiate prosecutions against any of the fellaheen who have committed actual breaches of the law. 8. T/,e legs! aspect of this question is dealt with in my despatch No.28 of June 29th to the political resident, a copy of which is enclosed, i ven without Tapu registration theK ^ the Shaikh would appear to he reasonably secure from legal attack» 9 . In view of the importance which ills Majesty's Government attaches to the difficulties which the shaikh of Kuwait is encountering with the ‘Iraqi Goveranent, i suggested to the lolitical Ke si dent in the Persian Gulf on his journey through Baghdad that it would he useful if the Political hgent at Kuwait could pay a short visit to this ^nbassy. colonel /owie concurred laid I underot and that the sanction of the Government of Indie is being sought, 1 feel sure that an exchange of views, in order to co-ordinate action both as regards the F&amp;o estate and the Shaikh’s other properties in ‘Iroo, should prove useful I have the honour to he ^ith the highest respect, etc. (3d) G.CGILVIE F0EBE8.

My dear Prime Minister, I am sending over with this letter an official note on the subject of the trouble that has broken out in the haikh of Kuwait’s estate at Pao. Amidst Your Excellency’s many activities it is possible that news of the serious situation that has arisen at Fao may not have reached you. Briefly, it appears that the fellaheen in the date gardens have refused to deliver to the Shaikh’s agent his share in the various produce which it is customary to send to Kuwait at this time of the year. Further, from the reports we have received from the Political Agent at Kuwait, the fellaheen appear to be in an ugly mood and to be making claims to the soil of a communistic nature. Actual acts of violence also are reported to have occurred* It will, I think, be obvious to Your Excellency that it devolves upon the ’Iraqi liovernment to take immediate action to nip this raovement in the bud, not only because the interests of a friendly and neighbouring State are involved, but because unless stern measures be taken at once, such a movement may easily^ spread to other estates in ’Iraq and thus involve the general peace and security of the country. ly note will demonstrate to tour Excellency the grave concern felt by His Majesty’s Government and this letter is merely to impress upon you personally the need ior the issue of immediate instructions to the authorities at Basrah and ao.

Thank you very much for your letter No. 190 of August 15th and for the copy of your letter to Gabriel of August 25th. We agree entirely with the terms o.^. the latter. If this case is heard, Gabriel must defend with all the weapons at his command, out, in view of certain assurances given in London oy King fa isal, it would be dangerous for him to take precipitate action. Thus, although Gabriel may himself now be optimistic as to the result, it would still be better to keep the case out of court, altogether if we can. We are working on those lines here at present. All I can say just now is that there is no danger of a hearing in the near future. 2. Incidentally, in your letter to the Political Resident No. 17? of August 5th you misquote me in paragraph 6. It is a small matter but is just worth while putting right. I said there was a eutenant Colonel H.R.P.

Many thanks for getting the complete list of heirs. Fortunately they are not as numerous as I feared they might be. 4. I hope to let you have a translation of the Power of Attorney in a few days. There was no one in the office competent to translate it when it arrived and I could not take the risk of sending it out. how Holt is back and he is having a shot at it. It is no easy document however, and he has many other pre-occupations. 5. Whether it will be necessary for me to visit Basra depends upon the success of our efforts here to get the case struck oii altogether. We will give you early notice of developments as they occur. In the meantime, perhaps it would be safer merely to tell the Shaikh that there is no iinmediate danger oj. a hearing.CONFIDENTIAL. i No. of 1935 The Hon ble the Political Resident in the Pei’sian Gulf presents his com pliments to The Political Agent, iiuw&amp;it. and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned docu ment ($).

I say I ixO u sua prisea becaune it in natural that the higher a man rises in the social comtimity the more conspicuous and attractive ue becomes,moreover, (.liere is no better wajr to test the importance of one ! s position in the social comunity•than to know the number and the personality of his enemies. There is no doubt that when one requires the services of some one he will either rely on his own personal knowledge in chosing such a one or that he will accept the recommendation of those who have actually tried and known him* 1 may be allowed to enclose herewith copies of my testi monials (in triplicate) for your kind perusal,which may prove that I have not been recommended wrongly to His Excellency the Shaikh,although His Excellency and your goodself have since known me by the services I have rendered so far. Yet another piece of evidence,may 1 be allowed to cite is - 1* That notwithstanding that I and my partner both being Chris tian^ and that there being more than a dozen of well known Mohammadan lawyers at Basrah we are being occasionally chosen by the local Government /as lawyers to conduct good many important cases filed against them* T give the following as an example(a) The site of the Basrah Central Telephone Exchange case 0 (h) The famous Tanooxaa Land case (Previously occupied by the Port Directorate,Basrah).

(b) His Highness Sayid Hashim Bey the Haqib of Basrah for a yearly retention fee of I,Dinars 150/- It may be a pride for me to mention that I am a self-ciade man and it therefore suffice me to_say that no better man could know and appreciate the value of his standing position and repu tation in the social comunity (which he lias attended after very hard struggle) than a man like my humble self,inasmuch as it is natural that anything acquired after hard struggle will be more valuable than that acquired otherwise by ease or chance. It is ^ therefore my fundamental principle to hold fast my standing repu tation and position which I have achieved after such a bitter and hard struggle,and in order to be able to do so I have learn ed and I have believed to be n IiQi-^bi ^as there is no oebwer poli cy than honesty.,.

SECRET 23rd September, 1933 My dear Dickson For your personal information I enclose a copy of a memorandum «Bnt by the Mutasarrif of Basra to the Ministry 53 of interior on the subject of the trouble at Fao. The trouble about the proportionate division of the produce seems to be connected with our old friend the Istihlak Law, The fellaheen are trying to recoup from the shaikhs what they will have to pay in taxes when they market their ' produce. As the old form of taxation fell primarily upon the landlord their attitude does not seem so unreasonable, but the matter is complicated in this case by the fact that the shaikh did not pay the old form of tax and claims that he should be immune from the new. The Prime Minister informed the Ambassador, v/hen he was tackled on the subject, that other landlords in other parts of the country are settling on a fifty-fifty basi s. The change in Mutasarrifs, though it had nothing to do with the pao troubles, may, we hope, turn out to the shaikh f s advantage. The f Iraqi Government Lieutenant-Colonel H. R. P. Dickson, C.I.E. &gt; political Agent, Kuwait.Government will, we feel sure, protect the shaikh against any really subversive movement by the fellaheen, but they will be less sympathetic to complaints which merely have to do with the division of the produce. •~ s ** t *' e - j *\JL&amp; I(m ' MUt + Sarr i f Basrats memo NO* G/318 of 27th August, 193o, to th© Ministry of interior* Our memo No. c/261 of 3rd August, 1933. As the dispute between the Shaikhs of Kuweit and pao fellahs reached at last the stage of ownership ’’Malakiya’*, I summarise below the history of the pao lands under dispute. M Mulk” in pao lands . Reports are current since old that the lands of pao were a small and limited spot containing a small number of date trees under the Tasarraf of Muntafiq shaikhs. Eighty years ago, one of those shaikhs offered same to the shaikhs of Kuweit, v/ho divided it into parts (Ahwaz) having fixed boundaries, and made the “Ta’abs” settle therein. They had constructed bunds, and planted date trees, thus, these lands became vast due to the addition thereto of lands that appear from the sea each year. At last, the number of date trees in the lands in question / amounted to over 7000 ,, Jireebs n . you will gather from the above that most of the said lands, if not all, unalienated miri ones, because they appeared from the sea, as indicated above. 'Ta T ainul ' between the Mall ak and the Ta’a b. As a result of local investigations, it appeared that the 'Ta’ab” receives 2/5ths of the produce. The Ta’ ab’s share of the first-fifth is considered 'Musha' to him from date trees, and the second fifth is given to him for his work, such as, dig ging out rivers, making bunds, planting date trees, their fecunda tion of cutting and other falaha v/orks. As regards fruits - which are naturally few — they usually go to the Ta f ab. prom this 'Ta’amul' at pao, only some properties, (the number of their 'Jireebs” is estimated at about 40) which are said to have been belonging to Al Jubran, are excepted. As also a similar number belonging to the 'Bait of Rashid', and other few jireebs, are excepted from the 'Ta T amul' in question. Only l/4th of the produce of these.dates trees is to be paid to the Shaikhs of Kuweit, in accordance with an old procedure based - as stated - on a written will from Al Saban’s grandfather. Pao Estates DifferenceDifference s, The difference between the Ta'abs and Al Sabah is attributed to the following three reasons; 1* It is stated above that the Ta’ab receives 2/5th from the net produce, and the remainder goes to the Shaikhs. The fifth of the original fifths of the shaikhs is deducted, being Government dues which the shaikhs used to pay in the time of the Ottoman Government. This custom continued in force until the application of the Istihlak LO-w, when the Tsbabs claimed half the produce of the date trees, considering that they are requited to pay the M ushr' from their own net shares. The Shaikhs of Kuweit have agreed to pay them 44 per cent from the produce, but the Ta f abs refused this division and insisted on claiming half. Owing to this insistence on the part of the Ta’abs, and the Shaikhs obstinacy, the difference between the two parties took a serious form. The shaikhs of Koweit began, therefore, to I stand in the way of the river-crafts arriving in Kuweit and wa which belong to the Ta'abs, on the allegation that these crafts carry smuggled sand, etc. Further, the shaikhs have filed suits against certain Ta'abs, for the recovery from them of their Mallikiya, a fact which led the Ta'abs to ask the the Agents of the shaikhs to produce/docments which prove their ov/nership. The Shaikhs have obtained judgments in default against the Ta'abs, but the latter have submitted objections to those judgments, thus the cases remained for the agent of the shaikhs to produce an agency wherein the ,f Tabligh and Taballagh' should not be excepted. The case was adjourned until after the vacation of courts. These are the true facts, submitted for information.KSSSOIIAI, fc SKCHST.

I trust this is what you want, and that you will find the translation fairly clear. 3. tfith the translation asked for I enclose also a copy of Mr.Gabriel 1 s covering letter, dated 1st October 1933, which speaks for itself. 4. You will notice thet ilr.Gabriel in paras 2, 3, and 4 of his letter talks about a legal defect in the certified copy of the Turkish text of the said power of attorney, which he suggests is a very serious omission, but which he hopes . will never be noticed by the defending counsel, when the case comes up for trial. 5. Feeling that this was a decidedly optimistic view to take, and not exactly flattering to the intelligence of his adversary in the coming case, I took the op ortunity of asking him what the 'weakness' was which he referred to, on a recent visit of Mr.Gabriel to Kuwait. (7th to 9th October). I added/ J.H.B. Nihill, Esquire, Legal Secretary to Ambassador, British Embassy, Baghdad.half of His Majesty*s Government, Resident, but for yourself who added that I wanted the information not only for 6. Mr,Gabriel at first was very averse to 2 was watching the &lt; what the defect was, saying quite candidly that in his view leakage took place sometimes from the British Embassy in Baghdad, ana migit also take place from the Bushire Residency (where one Mirza AH, brother of Hirza Mohamad, one of the counsels for the defence was employed). In the present case, any leakage, he said, would undo everything, and nullify the great advantage that the possession of the Power of Attorney had given the Shaikh. I mention the above with apologies of course. 7, On my promising to mark my letter to you ^SSGRST** and ask you and Bushire not to nut it on the file, he con sented to part with his information. 8, The defect according to Mr.Gabriel, lies in the 5th. line; of the S ngllsh Translation ( under lined by me ), which reads 'whose names are inscribed at the foot of the same document', 9, Mr.Gabriel went on to say that under the 'Royal I HAD A Oai/iya , (-Turkish Land Law) , it was necessary that the signatures of the Muslims mentioned (two necessary) should have been entered in the official register of such documents in • onetantinople, and that the omission of their names from the true copy now in his possession, mad© the document legal ly invalid. 10, Incidentally I showed i.ir.Gab riel (Be© the 4 th para of his letter) the copy of the power of Attorney sent to Bushire by His Majesty’s Ambassador, Constantinople, and forwarded to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Baghdad and myself under Bushire Confidential Ho.ll62-S, dated the 4th September 1935, This also made no mention of the two Muslim witnesses named, which, according to Mr.Gabriel, adds to theto the seriousness of the position. 11. * tills I think : r.

If the Jaddaghiy^ defect will not eaoape the notice of the shrewd lawyer who will be on the defense aide. It certainly will not escape carefully watch proceedings from the start. 14, It is also not by any means outside the bounds of possibility that I irza Mohamed, like the Shaikh*s lawyer, has also written for and obtained a copy of the original Power of Attorney, and has already found, the defect in question himself. 1 mention this as in a recent conversation, which kr.^hisholm of fh® A.r.O.C*, had with IT irza Mohamed, the latter who is legal advisor to the Oil Company, declared quite em phatically that the prosecution would win the case easily. 15.

In particular, the correspondence concerns the court suit raised in Basra Court by members of al-Zuhair family complaining against the Ruler of Kuwait. The suit in question concerns a portion of the Shaikh’s Faddaghiya estate on Shatt al-Arab, and the Bashiya land to which members of al-Zuhair family lays claim to. According to the reports, the Faddaghiya estate was owned by Aisha, wife of Ahmad Pasha Al-Zuhair, and she has given her husband a Power of Attorney to sell the land.In the volume, British officials discuss issues related to the land registration granted to the Shaikh by Sir Henry Dobbs, Revenue Commissioner, Basra, in 1915, and the importance of obtaining an original copy of the claimed Power of Attorney authorising the sale of the land by Ahmed Pasha al-Zuhair. British officials correspond with the Shaikh and his lawyer, Jacob Gabriel, asking them to prepare certain documents, including a list of the names of the legal living heirs of Ahmed Pasha al-Zuhair, an original Turkish copy of the Power of Attorney, and translated copies of the document both in Arabic and English.The volume includes notes of meetings held in Baghdad between British officials discussing the cases. It also includes copies of the four Tapu title deeds (ff 55-64) connected with the Shaikh of Kuwait’s Faddaghiya estate dispute, dated 1915. The volume also includes reports on agrarian troubles caused by the
                           fellaheenon the Shaikh’s Faw estates.The main correspondence in the volume is between the Political Resident, Bushire, the Political Agent, Kuwait, British Ambassador, Baghdad, the India Office, London, the Foreign Office, London, the Ruler of Kuwait and Jacob Gabriel, the Shaikh’s Agent in Basra.The volume’s core correspondence covers June- October 1933.
