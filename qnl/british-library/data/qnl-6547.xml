The difficulties winch arose both on the question of dues and in respect to the right of these vessels to fly the British flag, led Sir Stratford Canning, then Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, to discuss with the 1 orte the navigatfon of both the Tigris and the Euphrates by vessels under British colours, and the duties to be paid by them when engaged in this navigation. And m his despatch dated the 25th March, 1846, his Excellency explained as follows the arrangements which had been arrived at:— . r _. , ' British-owned vessels will continue to navigate the waters of Mesopoiciiiira. under their national colours, equally whether they are engaged in the loieign 01 in the internal trade, and they will pay upon the merchandize which they convey the amount oi duties respectively applied to each case by the Convention of Balti-Liman. 44 In the event of their being employed above the usual ports of entry in the internal traffic of the country, they will be liable'to the anchorage duty, which is always paid here, and which is sanctioned by the Capitulations; but instead of paying 12 piastres, as levied upon each vessel in the harbour ot Constantinople, they will only pay 5 piastres. ' There is no question of any difference between steam-boats and sailing-vessels. ♦ No. 9, p. 15, vol vii, ' Aitchison'R Indian Treaties.' t Bagdad, of courts lies on the Tigris, but the nearest point of the Euphrates is distant only 40 miles.— T . C. P. 0 J I have been unable to find a copy of this Firman at Bagdad. The document from which I quote is a French translation by Mr. Stavrides of the Turkish original in the archives of the Embassy, and was given me at Consiantinople in July last. The name of the commandant of the steamer is mentioned in this Firman, but is said not to be legible. I suggest a fresh reference to the Turkish original. If, as 1 think will prove to be the case, the name should be ' Lynch,' the circumstance will probably go far to account for the supposition— errenoous as it certainly is—that the right of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to run steamers on the rivers in question rests upon au old Firman granted to Messrs. Lynch and Co.—T. C. P. § Messrs. Lynch and Co., Messrs. Hector and Co.. . , r ^spect to vessels built in the country and owned by subjects of Great Britain, which cannot by our own regulations legally carry the national flag without registration under British authority, they will not pay higher duties than those required of the most lavoured ciass oi natives engaged in the internal trade, but they must be content to navigate like other vessels of the country. Though it is not impossible that such vessels as have hitherto abusively enjoyed the privilege of carrying their national colours may be tacitly allowed through favour to continue the same practice, it would not, I conceive, be proper for any British authority to support a claim which, be the state of the Turkish law what it will, is manifestly at variance with the enactments of our own legislation. ' r I he prospects which are opening to our trade in the eastern part of the Empire, and the importance which may justly be attached to the free navigation of its great rivers, wherever our vessels can find a sufficient depth of water for that purpose, have made me anxious to place our very natural though somewhat doubtful claims upon a sound looting, sanctioned by the acknowledgment of the Porte itself. This object could only be gained by frankly admitting such of its pretensions as we could not in fairness or consistency dispute.' In a subsequent despatch, dated the 4th April, 1846, Sir Stratford Canning for warded a copy in translation of the Vizirial instructions addressed to the Vali of Bagdad on the subject under consideration. For convenience of reference, I inclose a copy of this document, which is dated 6th Rebel Akhir, 1262 (2nd April, 1846). 7. By this settlement, 44 sanctioned by the acknowledgment of the Porte itself, the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates were, it appears to me, thrown open to British merchant-ships, without any restriction as to the number or description of the vessels to be used, and without any limitation to any particular firm. Ihe sole condition was that the dues as agreed upon should be paid. 8. In the year 1859 Messrs. Lynch and Co. contemplated placing a steamer on the Tigris, to run between Bagdad and Busrah, and based their ri^ht upon the correspondence of 1846, dealt with in the preceding paragraphs. Colonel Kemball, to remove all doubts upon the matter, on the 15th October, 1859, referred Sir H. Bulwer, then Her Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople, to Sir Stratford Canning's despatch of the 25th -i aic , 1846, and to the Vizirial letter dated the 2nd April, 1846, and inquired whether the latter document constituted ' a sufficient authority for British merchants to engage in the navigation of the rivers of Mesopotamia, or is a Firman or other special sanction necessai).^ Bulwer in his despatch dated the 13th February, 1860, replied as ioiiows^— could not be considered as conferring any permanent right.

One, that Messrs. Lynch and Co. did not apply for leave to em P lo y tw ° °he queft^n soecific number; their request was general in its terms. Ihe °ther, that the qu st asked by Colonel Kemball at Messrs. Lynch and Co. s instance in his letter dated thi 15th October, 1859, and Messrs. Lynch and Co.'s subsequent application 1 . &gt; show clearly that that firm cannot possibly claim a right to navigate the Tigris and Eunhrates under the terms of any exclusive Firman bearing an earlier date than thib j ear. In P o^r words! the two Firmans of 1834 and 18.1, quoted ia paragraph 4. have, by the evidence of Messrs. Lynch and Co.'s own letters, no application to that firm. 11. No answer was received to Messrs. Lynch and Co. s application until 861. In t n™ nf that vear Sir Henrv Bulwer transmitted, m original and translation, a Vizirial letter to the Pasha of Bagdad ' relative to the navigation of the Mesopotamian rivers by British steam-vessels and boats, and confirming the aiTangements ° f ^ I inclose copy of the Vizirial letter, which is dated 3rd Rejeb, li/7 (13th January, 1861 and the terms of which show that the Grand Vizier fully understood the d.s inc .oa between the two Firmans of 1834 and 1841, and the arrangements made by Sir Stratford Canning- in 1846. Thus, its recital correctly describes the two Firmans above mentioned as havinc been granted to the British Government and as having reference only to the Euphrates • further, that the arrangements of 1846 covered both Tigris and Euphrates, and included British merchant -vessels in general which m.ght trade on the two rivers ^h^y^^ggtabhshmen^oftthe^'EuphratesC^indTigris Steam Navigation Company, with Messrs Lvnch and Co. as agents, quickly followed the issue c.t this \ izinal letter and in the summer of 1862 the Company's first steamer, the 'City of London, was placed on the T lf The correspondence dealt with in the preceding paragraphs indicates with sufficient clearness the nature of the title of the above -mentioned Compan) to run steamers on the Tigris. That title evidently rests upon the Vizmal letter dated the 15th January, 1861, and consequently upon the earlier arrangements of 1846, which that letter con firmed and which Sir Henry Bulwer set aside. It may, perhaps, he argued that the Firmans of 1834 and 1841 were also confirmed by the Vizmal letter of 1861, and that consequently the Company is entitled to draw upon the provisions of those Firmans as well as upon the arrangement of 1846. If such a contention were made, it could he easily refuted. The Firmans in question were granted expressly to the British Goveinmen , anc not to any private firm; and there is no trace in the Viz,rial letter of 186 of any transfer of the concession from the one to the other. On the contrary, that letter recapitulated existin' rights and renewed and confirmed them without alteration. Moreover, the Firmans specify only the Euphrates, and they cannot be held to confer any right to establish a line of steamers on the Tigris. I do not think that the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company would have any cause to regret a conclusion which established thefr' tie to run steamers' on the Tigris, not upon either or both of the two Firmans above cited, but upon the comprehensive settlement of 1846. They would immediately occupy a far stronger position, with infinitely more extensive rights than any which they can possibly obtain inder the Firmans. The latter not only restrict the number of vessels to be employed to two steamers on the Euphrates, but provide that even this small concession shall be atany time liable to revision. The arrangements of 1846 include both rivers, and place no limit upon the vessels which may be employed in the navigation Possiblv but not. I hope, probably, the Company may hold hat the views which I maintain are more advantageous to British commerce in general than to their own peculiar Interests. They might, in 'fact, prefer that their own exclusive right to run two steamers nn the Tigris should be established than that the navigation of both the Tigris and the Euohrates should be open to the commerce of the world. I conceive, however that this view of the case would not find ready acceptance or support from Her Majesty s Government, even if the exclusive right could be shown to exist. A mere claim to such a rio-ht. unsupported by any substantial evidence, is not likely to meet much encourage- ment i3 To resume the narrative of the Company's operations on the Tigris. Notwith- Qtandiiff the Vizirial letter of 1861, the Ottoman authorities at Bagdad were not inclined to withdraw their opposition to the establishment of the steamer ' City of London. In his letter to the Ambassador, dated the 21st May, 1862, Colonel Kemball wrote .•, V ' &lt; ' s to aiTiv^^t'TiVli n ^ h - 'I'?

WfJ o/I P y j I? a x S r Sa ^ 0r tran sniitted, on the 13th January, 1862, a fresh Vizirial 1^ 1/ (o the \ah of Bagdad, 'repeating the directions already given to his i T^ nC '' ' 0 rpi 1 ?

The Vizirial letter re enec to is dated 5th Mohurrum, 1279 (2nd July, 1862), and its terms are identical with lose o the letter dated 3rd Rejeb, 1277 (15th January, 1861), I have not, therefore, thought it necessary to inclose a copy. 14. 1 his further letter silenced for a time the opposition of the local authorities. But eaily in 1664, when the intention of the Company to place a second steamer on the Tigris in connection with the Indian mail service became known, Namyk Pasha renewed his objections. And it is in the correspondence which then ensued that the Ottoman autho rities asserted for the first time that, under existing Firmans, only two British steamers were permitted to navigate the Tigris, and the persistency with which they reiterated this statement has apparently ended in securing its undisputed acceptance. They have, in fact, induced people to regard the British Government and a local British firm as identical entities, and to apply to the operations of that firm on the Tigris a Concession granted to the British Government for the Euphrates ; and having shown that the terms of that Concession allowed only two steamers, and that two steamers, the u City of London ' and the 44 Comet,' were, as a matter of fact, already stationed on the Tigris, there was no other conclusion possible but that the firm in question had no right to bring out what was described as a third steamer. One statement in this argument, that the &lt;£ Comet' belonged to the Euphrates and Tigris Company, was immediately assailed, and it having been proved that this vessel belonged to the Indian Government, the new steamer brought out by the Company, the ' Dijleh,' was permitted to run. The Porte, however, gained one important advantage from this discussion. The little mis-statement about the ' Comet' diverted attention from the substantia issue, and gave them the opportunity to discard, without detection, the correspondence of^ 18'16. Consequently, after that mis-statement had been set right, with the result that the Company attained the immediate object in view—withdrawal of opposition to the ' Dijleh -—nobody thought it worth while to traverse the far more important assertion that the Company's right to navigate the Tigris rested on a specific Hrman applicable to the Company alone, and restricted to two steamers. And it is a remarkable fact that, from the moment the controversy reached this stage, the Vizirial letters subsequently granted carefully abstain from any allusion to the arrangement of 1846, which was so distinctly confirmed bv the Vizirial letters of 1861 and 1862. _ . 15. Colonel Kemball having learned that Namyk Pasha contemplated opposition to the 'Dijleh,' drew his Excellency's attention to existing arrangements whereby British merchant -steamers were at liberty to navigate the Tigris without any limit as to number, and asked him to specifv his objection. , . , . . . Namyk Pasha replied that in the Vizirial letters preserved m his archives it was clearlv laid down that the British Government was permitted to run only two steamers on the Tigris, and to run them by turns, and as two steamers were now present, he was unable to perceive on what grounds a third steamer could be claimed. xNamyk Pashas views were firmly supported by his own Government, and the correspondence which ensued was persistently^onducted by the Turks on the admissible tmt tl ^re was no distin'ction between the Company's steamer the 'City of London and the Government steamer ' Comet,' and that no third steamer could be allowed And the British authorities appear to have been so far convinced of the soundness of the Turkish case that they seem to have agreed to withdraw the Comet, 01 . il r. .,the ' Diileh. This stage of the controversy Colonel Ken ^r in 'a despatch from Her Majesty's Charg^ d'Afiaires dated the 'Wf m &lt;• 'rftSiUSST' tfPSTA'SZSSSSt Her Majesty s Embassy had asx s 'oDDOser ^ la navigation sur le Tigre du nouv'ea^bateau^ vapenr que Me'ssrs.

In 1874 Lynch and Co. applied on behalf of the Euphrates and ligns ^ cam Navigation Company to replace the 'City of London/' which would be turned into a store-ship, by a new steamer. Immediately advantage was taken of this request to revive the old theorv that the British Government and the above-mentioned Company were identical, that only two steamers carrying the British flag were allowed on the Tigris, and that owing to the presence at one time of the 'Comet, the City of London, t e ' Dijleh,' and a small steam-launch, the authorized number had been exceeded, and that, consequently, compliance with the Company s application was out of the question. Colonel Herbert, to whom this note from the Porte was referred for verification, explained once more the real position of the &lt;( Comet,' and disposed of various other mis-statements which the note contained.t These explanations were accepted, and the status of the ' Comet was once again clearly defined in Sir Henry Elliot's despatch dated the 29th May, and in Safvet Pasha's note dated the 31st March, 1875. But the old mistake was repeated, that the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company ran their steamers on the Tigris under a special Firman &amp; granted to Messrs. Lynch and Co., which limited,, the number of vessels to two steamers. 19. The propositions which I venture to think are established by the correspondence dealt with in the preceding paragraphs are:— * (1.) That the British Government has, under the Firmans of 1834 and 1841, which have been confirmed by the Vizirial letters of January 1861 and July 1862, the right, subject to certain specified conditions, to navigate the River Euphrates with two steamers ' for the purpose of trade.' (2.) That under the arrangements of 1846, also confirmed in the Vizirial letters of 1861 and 1862, British merchants are at liberty to navigate the Tigris and the Euphrates under the British flag and without any restriction as to the number or description of the vessels employed, subject only to the payment of the stipulated dues. (5.) That the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, represented bv Lynch and Co., have no Firman granting them an exclusive privilege to navigate the Tigris with two, and only two, steamers. Their rights really depend on the arrangement of 1846, and, so far, are neither greater nor less than those which may be claimed by any British merchant. 20. I now come to the correspondence of 1880, which has led to the revival of the * See from Ambassador, March 12, 1874. t Ambassador, January 8, 1874.-- large question dealt with in your Excellency's reference under reply. There is no i cq T m Ascribe this correspondence in detail. It is sufficient to sav that in March IbbO Messrs. Lynch and Co. (acting as agents for the Euphrates and Tigris Steam „ I 0 ,? Com P an y) complained that the Vali of Busrah had objected to the steam-ship Kahfah towing a barge, and had declared that he could not allow another barge to leave, except under sanction from Constantinople. Messrs. Lynch and Co. added that they had • given notice six months before of their intention to employ barges, that one barge had )w been in use for three months, while the other had made several trips. It soon transpired that the ground taken by Zabhit Pasha, then Vali of Busrah, was the old one that Messrs. Lynch and Co. were only entitled to run two steamers on the Tigris, and that as barges were not expressly mentioned in the Firman which regulated the matter their use could not be permitted except under sanction from Constantinople. T he Porte lully supported this view of the case, and when ultimately, under considerable pressure, the barges were permitted to run, the sanction was made to depend upon the continuance of the existing famine in Mesopotamia. And this view is maintained not only in a recent letter dated the 13th February, 1881 (copy inclosed), from the Vali to myself, but also in the Ottoman note dated the 11th December inclosed in your Excellency's despatch. This note, however, differs from those which have preceded it in one very important particular. Whereas in former notes—see, for instance, Aali Pasha's note dated the 1st October, 1864, and Safvet Pasha's dated the 13th March, 1875—the Firman which is said to define Messrs. Lynch and Co.'s rights is described as relating to the Tigris, its provisions are in the present note applied to the Euphrates. It might reasonably be objected that a prohibition which on the face of it relates to the Euphrates cannot be transferred to another river. The fact, however, is, as I have already established, that the Firman in question w T as granted to the British Government, and has no sort of application to Messrs. Lynch and Co. or any other private firm. 21. The letter from the local agent of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, referred to in paragraph 2 of this despatch, deals with the particular question of the right of the Company to tow barges. Mr. Blockey's argument is (1) that the Company (or rather Lynch and Co., to whose rights the Company has succeeded) has for years employed country boats on the river trade, and that these boats have, when occasion required, been towed by the steamers, and that no objection has been made. If they may tow boats laden with cargo, why may they not tow barges ? Again, the right to have two steamers necessarily applies the right to use them in any and eveiy way m which a steamer can be ordinarily used, and it is absurd, Mr. Blockey contends, to say that the Company's steamers may be employed to carry cargo but not to tow it. I think that these arsruments are entitled to consideration, and in support of Mi. Boc eys assertions as to the frequent use of barges on the Tigris, I may cite the example of the Turkish steamers on that river. 22. In my endeavour to suggest an answer to the question propounded m your Excellency's letter I have hitherto drawn only upon the correspondence on record in my office which especially relates to the navigation of the Tigris and the Euphrates. beg further to cite Article 23 of the Capitulations and Article VIII of the Treaty of Commerce nf Iftfil Article 23 which is confirmed by Articles I and II of the Treaty of 18 , Illr.

The terms of these Articles are comprehensive, and make no reservation in favour of the Tigris or Euphrates or any other river. And as it is a fact that Ottoman merchant-steamers r up and down the Tigris, it seems to me that British vessels are also entitled to navigate that river for purposes of commerce. I have &amp;c (Signed) ' TREVOR CHICHELE PLOWDEN. Inclosure 2. Messrs. Lynch and Co. to Consul-General Plow den. The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company {Limited), Sir, Bagdad, March 11, 1881. WE have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of yesterday's date, asking us to state the grounds upon which this Company bases its claim to tow barges on the river between this and Busrah. From information laid before Her Britannic Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs by the Directors of this Company in a letter dated the 20th May last, we learn that the right of foreign subjects to employ large native boats has repeatedly been admitted by the Porte, and prior to the estciblishment of this Company in 1861 the whole of our own trade was conducted by means of native boats owned by us, and flying the English flag, and such boats have been continually used by us ever since for the purpose of carrying coal, and, when necessity required, being towed with cargo in them. Finding, however, that these boats were unsuitable in the low season, owing to their excessive draft of water, our Directors decided upon building iron barges to carry on the same services as had hitherto been performed by wooden boats. These barges, except during a brief interval last year when they were temporarily prohibited, have been towed uninterruptedly since their construction in December 1879. When the Porte granted the required permission for our Company to run steamers on this river there was no restriction placed upon the uses to which they were to be applied, and it is well known that river steamers in these countries are more often used for towing than for any other purpose. It seems to us, therefore, just as reasonable to impose a limit of cargo to be carried on board each steamer as to prohibit their towing barges, which, whether towed, sailed, or tracked up, cannot, under any circumstances, have any political significance. No objection could possibly be raised against the employ ment of barges propelled by either of the two latter primitive modes; the forbidding their being towed, therefore, merely resolves itself into a prohibition against the adaptation of a more expeditious means of transit.

THE British Embassy having recently made certain communications for the purpose of obtaining a renewal of the orders which were sent concerning the British steamers and boats authorized by His Majesty to ply on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates, it has appeared, from the register that permission having on a former occasion been applied for by it to station two steamers on the River Euphrates at Bagdad, and to run them by turns for the purpose of facilitating trade, two Firmans, dated respectively the end of Shaban 1250 and the beginning of Redjeb 1257, were addressed to the late Governor- General of Bagdad, Ali Riza Pasha, authorizing the permanent station of two steamers on that river, providing it were proved and established that the advantages resulting there from would be mutual, and that no sort of inconvenience would ensue. Further, that in virtue of a Report received respecting the dues payable by vessels and boats navigating the Euphrates and Tigris, and in conformity with the request of the British Embassy for Vizirial instructions, on the ground that British merchant-vessels mighty trade in those two rivers after payment of the fixed dues according to Treaty, and considering that the transnort of goods from one point on those two rivers to another, without going to sea, is' in fact, internal trade, and that, under sucb circumstances, vessels under whatsoever flasr it may be must pay the same dues as Ottoman vessels or boats, and that British vessels whether coming loaded from abroad and entering one of those two rivers with their car'oes, or issuing therefrom to the sea laden with Otloman produce and bound for f SLn ries after having paid the dues payable on their cargo, according to the Treatv and Tariff, are only liable to the payment of ' palamar actchesi ' (t e., 'S 1 ° moori'ns) or cable-money, on entering or leaving the Tigris or Euphrates, like all foreign sbips coming to ° the n' ort ® ReWdakhir^e^'inttructions were sent to Bagdad in internal trade as on n . be '^ e n g g: sliall hav e been levied on merchant-ships of the house duties payable on t a abroad, a sum of 5 piastres cable-money same nation, e ' h ^ i ^Xf„!thrnrover aud , ' a bo4 that should be exacted.
