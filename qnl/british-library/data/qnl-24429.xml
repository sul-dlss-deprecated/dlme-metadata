We have been, in oomrmmication with our Divisional Manager in the Persian Gulf and have ascertained that between 1935 «rod 1942 our Bahrein wireless station was in telegraphic oora arnica tion intermittently with Dohah (Qatar), a service which was undertaken at the request of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. This service was discontinued in December 1942. in March 1944 at the request of Petroleum Concessions Ltd., it was arranged for Bahrein to exchan e radiotelephone calls with their launch when visiting the Trucial Coast and Qal -r. In order to assist Petroleum Concessions, the above mentioned telephone service was extended occasionally to Dukhan (Qat r). e are informed that Petroleum Concessions much appreciated the service furnished and are likely to request this Company to make the service peiTnanent. Before we discuss further the establishment by the Company of a wireless telegraph station in Qatar, we think that it would bo advantageous to ascertain the status of Petroleum Concessions as regards telecommunications in Qatar.AKJrtl =10 THHWlUfiaVOD .JnamtiBqaQ (J 1 AM flIA) ^gTTHJ zznmxs h' « We are infonaed that the terms of their Concession in Qawar, Fe^roletLa Concessions ay constx*uct, maintain, and operate telegraph and telephone installations anci their lines and tireless stations'.

We have discussed this matter here with the Political Resident (at present on deputation in this country) and with Petroleum Concessions Limited, The latter do not at present feel any need for telegraphic facilities beyond those they have already arranged with Cable and Wireless at Bahrain, There is probably little other traffic that Cable &lt;&amp; Wireless could obtain in Qatar at the moment, and amenities, accommodation, etc. for staff would be difficult to provide. On the other hand with the expansion of the Oil Company^ activities (which have only Just started) in the Qatar Peninsula the need for a post and telegraph office will arise in due course from the point of view of the general public. 3. In the circumstances we feel that the proposal for the establishment of telegraphic communications in Qatar may be allowed to lie dormant for the time being , unless Cable &amp; Wireless themselves wish to pursue it. If you see no objection perhaps you would inform Cable and Wireless accordingly. 4* i enclose a copy of a letter I have sent to Longrigg of P.C.L.

DOHA, 24th September 1949. ^hen I was discussing the Question of communic- ations with Langhem, he mentioned that the terms of the Company's agreement with Cable and Mreless Ltd. did not allow them to handle other than Company commercial traffic on the Company wireless system, but that the volume of out side traffic which they were in fact handling had reached reached the point where they would have to stop before Cable and Wireless complained about rt. As Cable and Wire less now provide an adequate service between Bahrain and Qatar, it can only be a matter of time before they wake up and insist on it being used. 2 . I agreed with him that it was better for the Com pany to take the initiative in ending the present system, (which grew up when there was no C&amp;vV service, and at a time when traffic other than Company traffic was inconsiderable) and said that we were qnly too anxious to make proper use of the C&amp;W facilities in the normrl way, not least*in order to reduce the burden we imposed on the Company as much as possible, I said that as far as I was concerned he could begin at once to pass my telegrams to you over the C&amp;Ys link, and that I thought that you would do trie same with telegrams to me. S. This does not effect telegraphic traffic within the peninsula, as there are no internal facilities provided by CMi. ihe company will continue to pass telegrams for me between Dukhan and Doha. The only difference will be that i shall address telegrams to you direct and they will be delivered to you di by C&amp;Vv instead of through Lermitte's office, i shall then get a bill periodically from CdcW.

Dear Sir Rupert, NwX I enclose a copy of a letter No.4/23/49 ,\^ of September 24 sent to me by Wilton on the subject of telegraphic communication with Qatar. When this question was last raised in 1946 it was decided (Re sidency printed letter to the Agency No.952'-S of November 6, 1946) that the matter should lie dormant until public need arose. It appears from Wilton’s letter that the time is now ripe for the establish ment of public telegraphic facilities in Qatar. 2. You will recall that the relevant article in the treaty is now In force. The Manager of Cable and Wireless informs roe that he is already handling traffic to the value of 6,000 rupees with P.C.L. monthly in Qatar and that other traffic amounts at present to 200 rupees monthly. Mr. Penfold said that there was no reason why radio telephone connexions with the United Kingdom and the United States should not be extended to Qatar. In that event a member of their United Kingdom staff would be permanently stationed in the peninsula. Mr. Penfold added that his or ganisation liked to co-operate with local bodies in the matter of power units and this should be of in terest to the local government. 3. It appears to me that although the present income from telegraph* may not immediately justify the installation expenses Cable and Wireless as His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain. a monopoly v - . ^ -2 6,m a monopoly service have a public duty to perform and that Qatar should not be denied telegraphic facilities.

Evans, the Chief L.ocal Representative of the Company, tells me that this is a part of the Company's economy drive, and that the wireless installation and operator are t&lt;? be withdrawn, and that he or his succes sor will have to make do with some form of Radio Telephone, which naturally means that he will not wash to spend much time passing verbal mes sages for outside people. 2 . Cable and Wireless have been toying with the idea of opening up in Doha for some months, but have not got very far with it. Could they be prodded ?

He was not however very optimistic about anything happening in the immediate future. In the meantime however he asked if you could give him further information which would supply him with more ammunition, l.e., to what extent the demand for telegraphic facilities would increase If they opened up in Doha and what are the possibilities of their ob taining accommodation, electricity, water and the other necessities of life. Yours sincerely, A.J. Wilton, Esq., Political Officer, Qatar, Doha. 2 l, x&lt; ° ' )R' j Confidential 26/iL/5a. British Agency, Jjoha, 6 th July 195U. Please refer to your C/Q-152 of 29th June. 2. It is ido st depressing to find that Cable and hireless have made no progress in their attitude during the past six months. Messrs. Penfold and nov.deswell came here just before Christmas last year and discussed the volume (pf traffic, the rent of ? suitable house, the cost-of-living and every other relevant aspect of their setting up here. As a result of that visit, I understand .9 , that they reported that the volume of traffic v-as less, S'' 0 ' and the expense greater, than would justify opening^in^ Doha, and that if would be better to wait. Ijd^Tiot know what weight they gave to their obligations&gt;-frtfa monopoly service (Jakins's' C/R-44Y of cOth September last to H.&amp;.) or to the fact that at present they pocket the charges on the not inconsiderable volume of traffic between Bah rain and ^Qatar which is handled at this end entirely by the Oil Company and without any expense to themselves. However, if the Oil Company now find it impossible to jus tify the expense of this additional work, and withdraw their service altogether, I think a certain obligation rests on Cable and Wireless to put something in its^place. The Com pany are not dropping the thing because the volume of traf fic does not justify its maintenance,- rather the contrary. 3. I cannot supply any very useful estimates of the volume of traffic, but it is obviously increasing and will continue to do so. If the increase in the volume of mail since the Postal service became available is any indication, large numbers of people are only waiting for the service to begin in order to'use it. The Oil Company have, and are no doubt prepared to divulge, actual figures of traffic handled, but it must be remembered that they reject a certain number of telegrams, and that the general' poulace and the merchant community do not have the use of their facilities at all. Also, if a service is operating when the Superior Company open up, they will doubtless make use of it, whereas if there is none, they too will be obliged to set up their ov;n show, with free telegrams for the Sheikh etc. and all the other paraphernalia which makes it so difficult to get rid of these private installations once they are begun. 4. As far as the cost-of-living is concerned, Messrs. Cray Mackenzie Ltd. have a somewhat similar set-up m iJoha to whet I understand Cable and tireless v.ere contemplating, and tiiey would probably supply their figures if asked. The Eastern Bank make a Dona allowance of 3 o on the Bah rain figure, Vv’ater costs 3 As. a four-gallon tin, and is available in virtually unlimited cuantities and is of far better quality than any Bahrain water. There is no elec tricity on sale yet in Doha, but they would presumably need their own generator for the set in any case. The Dank have a very sensible-looking little 3 Kw. engine. 5.

Dear Department, Petroleum Concessions Limited and Petroleum Development(.atar) have recently withdravm all wireless telegraph facilities from Doha and as a result we now have no telegraphic communication with the Political Officer in Qatar. Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd. have had under consiaeration the possibility of opening a branch in Doha but so far nothing has materialised, mainly we understand on account of an adverse report sent to the Company by their local manager. Whatever the economic aspect may be and we understand that once a regular branch is opened in Doha the volume of telegraphic traffic will increase fairly rapidly, it is most undesirable from the political point of view that the Bahrain Agency should be unable to communicate urgently with one of its most important centres.

They also plan a similar installation at Dubai, namely a wireless link with Bahrein and an internal automatic telephone system. The company will be grateful for your support in securing from the Shaikhs of Doha and Dubai the necessary licenses which might be in terms similar to the company's licenses at Bahrain and Kuwait. At Sharjah, International .aeradio Limited already send messages to Bahrein and it is agreed that the extension of facilities there should continue to be handled by them. They have advised Cable and Wireless that they are thinking of operating a very high frequency circuit between Sharjah and Dubai. In this event, we consider that the Dubai end should be handled by Cable and Wireless. If you agree with this proposal, would you help IAL also to obtain the licenses they need ? Yours sincerely (R.F.G. Sarell) C.J Pelly, Esq., 0 bahra; BahrainC r &amp; No.c/r-6'3/- Political Agency, Bahrain, 9th October, 1960. Deer Pinhey, ^ 4 Please refer to the^cprrespondence ending with Andrew*s letter No.C/R-481 of 13th September to you, on the subject of concessions for Cable and Wireless to operate in Qatar and pubai. 2. Yesterday Gahan brought in drafts of proposed concession agreements (forwarded herewith, return re quested) forwarded by his London office and asked my advice about negotiating the concessions. 3. These drafts differ from the existing Bahrain for agreement,mainly in that,the latter provide^the trans- mi ssion of the Shaikh’s private messages free of charge and there is a provision for the Company undertaking to train the subjects of the Shaikh of Bahrain for operating its installations. 4. Generally speaking (and particularly speaking in the case of Clause 7 which is not in the Bahrain agreement),these drafts are more favourable to the Company than was the final Bahrain agreement. They also require amendments in certain minor particulars of phrasing. Nevertheless, I think we may accept them as opening bids and assist the Company to negotiate forthwith on the basis of these without referring to the Foreign Office. I should be grateful if you would let me know whether Sir Rupert Hay agrees to this. 6. Gahan told me that the Company thought that the Divisional Manager ought to negotiate the agreements, but /that L.A.G. Pinhey, Esq., O.B.E., The Residency, Jufair. /2 - that he would not be here until the end of November. I said that I did not think that it was necessary for him to negotiate and that if the Company agrees, Gahan could do so himself. Unless there is any objection, I propose to inform Urn accordingly and believe that his Company will agree. He can then open negotiations as soon as possible. Stobart and Jacomb will of course - be asked to help him. Yours sincerely.\ 0 ' British Residency, Bahrain. (463/14/50) UNCLASSIFIED j) JLdL&gt;\^ / 14th October, 1950. Please refer to your letter No. C/R-531 of the 9th October about concessions for Cable &amp; '..ireless to operate in &lt;^tar and x&gt;ubai. Sir Rupert agrees that negotiations may be opened between the Company and the.' Shaikhs of Qatar and Dubai for the grant of concessions to operate telegraph and telphone services, and that we need not refer to the Foreign Office. He can see no objection to Gahan negotiating the agreement with the help of Stobart and uacoirib. C.J. Felly, Esq., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain.-—*-No.C/L-334 Political Agency, Bahrain, 26th October, 1960. Sir &amp; I return herewith the draft conces sion agreements forwarded with your letter No.39 of 7th October for Qatar and Dubai. I am to say that the proposal that your company should negotiate for concessions on the basis of these agreements is approved. 2. There is no objection to you yourself conducting the negotiations for these conces sions. 3. The Shaikh of Qatar should be referred to as 'His Excellency' and net 'His Highness”. The Shaikh of Dubai is not entitled to any honorific prefix. The Political Officers at Sharjah and Qatar are being asked to assist you in the negotiations.

G) G ia:G/ f ''- c y r\f o ( ‘G J p//p/ h/jIuL It is not known v/hy P.R. has referred to us in this matter because the opening of a telegraph station in Qatar is still under consideration by I.O., vide Residencv X.L'. at s.l. It was suggested in this X.L. that P.C.L. and v C &amp; W should jointly consider the subject. When the A&lt;I.O.C. (who made the original concession) opened a wireless station at Dohah it was used for communicating with Abadan via C &amp; W, Bahrain. Please see pages 161, 163, 173, and 179 of F.10/3-VI and pages 37*, 38 of F.10/3-VIIT. P.C.L. took over this W/T station at Dohah but subsequently transferred it to their camp at Dukhan, vide pages 158 and 166 of F.10/3-X. It was used presumably for communicating with P.C.L's Bahrain Office via C d W, Bahrain. P.C.L's Qatar establishment may in future also wish to communicate with their establishments on the Crucial Coast (and Muscat). Presumably however messages for any post outside Qatar could be routed through C &amp; V/, Bahrain, and this would seem the easiest and most satisfactory S3L±jmb£K arrangement until P.C.L. know their requirements better. But we should not forget that H.M.G. also have their requirements and that these may have to be considered separately from those of P.C.L.
