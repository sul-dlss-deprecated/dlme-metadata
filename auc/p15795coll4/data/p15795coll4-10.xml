Herod the Great is one of the most important characters in Jewish history.  He was appointed king of Judea by the Roman Empire in 37 B.C.E. and ruled until his death in 4 C.E.  Herod, in an attempt to prove his Jewish faith, married his second wife, Miriamne, in 45 B.C.E. Miriamne was the Hasmonean Alexandros, and thus one of the last heirs to the Hasmonean dynasty of Judea.  Although Herod is fabled to have loved the reknown beauty, he murdered her brother, Aristobulus, and  Mariamne was executed in 29 B.C. Jealous, Herod murdered his two sons by Miriamne, Alexandros and Aristobulus in 7 B.C.E.</dc:description><dc:subject>Herod I, King of Judea, 73-4 B.C.; Mariamne, consort of Herod I, King of Judea, ca. 57-ca. 29 B.C.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Genealogy</dc:subject><dc:coverage>Judaea (historical region); Israel; Asia</dc:coverage><dc:type>Still Image</dc:type><dc:format>image/jp2</dc:format><dc:format>258 p.; 24 x 16.5 cm.</dc:format><dc:format>manuscripts (document genre)</dc:format><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:identifier>SC-2003-01-01-08-6</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Iryan Moftah Coptic Language and Religion Manuscripts</dc:relation><dc:source>Iryan Moftah Collection of Manuscripts; Iryan Moftah Coptic Language and Religion Manuscript and Book Collection; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2013, American University in Cairo.
