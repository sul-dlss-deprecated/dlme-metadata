The first correspondent stated as being in command of the Persian Gulf Squadron is Commodore Richard Ethersey; the second correspondent to appear in this role is Acting Commodore John William Young.

The letter in question is addressed to Robert Barclay Chapman, Officiating Under-Secretary to the Government of India.The letters primarily discuss the movements of vessels belonging to the Persian Gulf Squadron. A couple of letters include lists of vessels which have arrived and/or sailed from Bushire, along with details of their cargo.
