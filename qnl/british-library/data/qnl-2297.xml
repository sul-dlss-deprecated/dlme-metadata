Since Galloway cannot be expected to pay from hi®' own pocket rupees 20,000 for a car (prices in Persia are double or treble this) I trust the Government of India will see th*ir way either to provide Galloway with a free government car or to supply him with e at a reasonable price or in view of the importance of his post to the war effort, to arrange for the supply by the army department either on payment or on permanent loan until six months after the end of the war a new oar or station wagon for use in his district. 4. ^Meanwhile temporary loan of an old army station wagon has again been secured for him but this is unfit for touring putside Ahwaz 0 [R ends].

Sir, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a despatch that I received under flying seal from His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz, recommending increases in the emoluments of the Head Clerk and Head Hunshi at that post. 2. Mr. Watkinson’s request is, in my opinion, fully justified, and I trust that sanction may be given for the increases which he recommends. The presence of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company inevitably leads to a higher standard of living and exx^enditure, for Persians as for foreigners, and the difference between the salaries paid at Ahwaz and at the subordinate post of Mohammerah is one cf those anomalies of which many exist in South Persia and which have repeatedly been brought to the attention of your department. 3. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz (No. 70). I have, etc., (Signed) Y.A.L. Mallet. The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I. euC., etc., etc. The Foreign Office, LONDON. i i \ \Copy Nn 1 P • BRITISH CONSULATE, /&gt; AH'^AZ, July 12th, 1933. Sir, With reference to your despatch No. 4 (K 13622/187/234), dated December 1, 1932, in accordance with the instructions contained in which additional bonus was issued to the whole ^t^ff of this Consulate with the exception of the let Clerk and the 1st Munehi, I have the honour to request that this matter may again be given your consideration in view of the continued rise in the cost of living and the special position of these two employees. 2. The Head Clerk is an Indian, wno, although locally engaged and paid in local currency, is dependent on the rupee exchange when making remittances to his d ependents in India and for insurance purposes. A man of his standing must maintain a standard of living which he finds it difficult to do on his present emoluments. It is essential to retain the services of an Indian Clerk in Ahwaz where there is a colony of over two hundred Indians,, many of whom know no language but Hindustani, and whose peculiar problems are more readily understood by one acquainted with Hindu and Indian Moslem practices. This community is additional to tne three hundred odd Indian personnel of the Anglo/ The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., ( etc. , etc., etc., Foreign Office, LONDON.Anglo lersian Oil Company Limited in Anwaz and the Oilfields, whose many requirements are normally presented to this office y in Wl ’ itin e through the Company. Mr. D’Souza has now completed nearly seven years service in this Consulate. 3. The Head Munshi has served continuously in the Consulate since 1914. Mirza Mohammed has a wide circle of local acquaintances, whom he entertains from time to time, and, as a i'eraian subject, he has the entree to the Kbuzistan Club, where ne is able to establish touch with local officials and perform much useful work of an unofficial nature. In addition to such expenses he has to associate with higher Persian employees of the Anglo Persian Oil Company and of the South Persian Railways, wuose remuneration is vastly higher than his own and whose standard of living is certainly superior to, or more expensive than that prevailing in otner parts of Persia. They are, for example, accustomed to the use of imported food stuffs, cigarettes und various beverages on the analogy of their English and Indian colleagues. 4. I consider tdat both these members of the staff are inadequately paid. it is not reasonable to compare tneir position with that at otner Consular posts in Persia where it would appear from your despatch under reference that salaries arerelstively lower. m point of fact, however, at posts where an establishment is maintained on a rupee basis, tne remuneration is actually higher at the present time in terms of sterling. 5. Without going further afield than tne Moharamerah Vice Consulate, a post supposed to be inferior in grade to Anwaz, a comparison of salaries gives the following result Head Clerk.

During the first five months of this year, when the exchange varied from Rials 100 - 105 to the £, tne disx)arity was even greater. Yet the actual cost of living in Ahwaz is at all times higher than in Mohammerah where local supplies exist. 6. Since tne present scales of pay were fixed, the cost of living, measured in terms of currency, has continued to rise, as will be seen from the enclosed list of retail prices in May 1931, 1932 and 1933. The actual increase since 1931 on tne total expenditure on rent, local servants, fuel and light, food, wines and spirits, cigarettes, shoes and material for clothing is 35/a. (if wines and spirits and imported tobacco be excluded, tne increase is 33$). 7. In tne last twelve months, owing to the increase in road taxes and Customs surcharges, the following increases in the price of articles in ordinary use have been noted, according to statistics supplied by the Anglo Persian Oil Company:- cigarettes 72,o : tinned fruit and jams 63 - 65$ : beer 62$. 8. I have the honour most earnestly to request therefore that provision may be made, if possible as from April 1, last, for an increase of 30$ in the salary both of the Indian Head Clerk and of tne Head Munsni, or of an equivalent sum in tne form of Customs Compensation.

Sir, With reference to the accompanying despatch wnich I am addressing to the Foreign Office on the subject of the pay of the Indian Head Clerk and of the Head Munshi at this Consulate, I have the honour to request your further support in this matter. 2. I have endeavoured to explain in my reply to Foreign Office despatch No. 9 of September 6 last, copy of which is attached, that I consider the circumstances referred to as grounds for declining to pursue the matter to be out of date and therefore irrelevant. 3. Though conditions at other posts in South Persia, wnich happen to be run on a Government of India scale, should undoubtedly be taken into account, there should be no question of comparison with other posts in Persia where conditions of living are totally different, as is tne case with all posts administered by the Foreign Office. In Isfahan and Kermanshah, for instance, living is very appreciably cheaper and easier and salaries are therefore presumably lower in comparison. The additional feature which probably makes this the most expensive place to live in throughout South Persia is the presence of the highly-paid Anglo Persian Oil Company. It is inevitable that my/ Sir Reginald H. Hoare, K.C.MG. His Britannic Majesty's Minister, etc., etc., etc., British Legation, Tehran.my staff should be 'rather highly paid'. Without making invidious comparisons, it may perhaps be claimed that, in y-s return for a higher rate of pay they put in a considerably greater amount of responsible labour in this sticky climate than is necessary at posts where the routine work is less. This is the more so since the Government of India ceased to maintain a Vice Consul here, as the Head Clerk is virtually in charge (tnough not nominally so) during trie Consul’s long absences on tour or shorter absences elsewhere. It is partly in view of such considerations that you and your predecessor have recommended that this post should become a Consulate General. Whatever may be the upshot of that, it is essential that an efficient, well-paid and contented staff should be maintained here. As regards the Indian Head Clerk, it should be taken into account that Mr. D’Souza, though ectualljr engaged locally seven years ago, can hardly be treated on the same basis as the local Persian or Armenian staff of this or of other Consulates. He is an imported foreigner and is entitled to the same consideration for that reason which he would have were he employed by any commercial concern or by the Government of India in this country. He is not able to live as ne should on his present pay. 5. The Head Munshi is of course in a different position, but I consider that similar provision Should also be made for him. He has expenses which are quite peculiar to this post. He always accompanies the Consular officer on tour from here, during which time he has to maintain a separate establishment. Since/Since last year he has been a member of the Khuzistan Club, where he keeps in touch with local affairs, in a manner which could ^ not be achieved any where else or in any other ways* his subscriptions and other expenses there run into well over one thousand rials per year. No provision is made for any Nourouz gratuity to him, though it is the practice in some posts to pay a full month’s salary on that occasion. This is partly made good out of my own pocket, in addition to which it has been necessary to advance loans to him on several occasions during the year to meet expenses unavoidable for a man in his postion. It thereiore appears to me self-evident that his salary is inadequate. 6. I should therefore be most grateful if further support could be given to my request for an immediate increase of 30$ in the basic salary paid to the Head Clerk and to the Head Munshi at this Consulate, and if special stress could be laid on the peculiar positions at this post. I have, etc., (Signed) A.f. Watkinson. H.B.M’S CONSUL FOR KHUZISTAN.Copy No.^0. BRITISH CONSULATE, AHWAZ, December 19th, 1933. Sir, With reference to your despatch No. 9 (k 9640/2296/234) of September 6 last, regarding the pay of the head Clerk and of the head Munsni at this Consulate, I regret the decision that it is not considered advisable to take up tne matter at present in view of my predecessor’s report dated May 21, 1932, and of the opinion which tne Lords Commissioners of his Majesty’s Treasury expressed at that time that these two employees are already rather highly paid. I beg to observe that there seems to be a misunderstanding on both these circumstances, and I earnestly hope that it may be possible to give the matter further consideration. 2. Mr. Consul Monypenny stated in his despatch No. 11 of May 21, 1932, that these two employees were adequately paid then and until such time as there is a still further increase in the cost of living. It is precisely this eventuality which I reported in my despatch No. 12 of July 12 last. As then stated there has been an increase of 35$ in terms of currency in the cost of living in Ahwaz since the present salaries of these two members of the staff were fixed. 3. I venture to think that the Treasury view referred to in your despatch No. 4 (K 13622/187/234) of December 1, 1932, tnat the salaries paid in Anwaz are somewhat ni^h as compared The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, O.C.S.I., Etc. , Hite. , iiitc. , foreign Office, LONDON. with/witn other Consular posts in Persia, was expressly stated to be in connexion with the issue of bonus or upon the occurrence of vacancies in the post of Head Indian Clerk or of Head Munshi. 4. There is no question of requesting a higher rate of bonus for employees at this post than may be paid at otaer Consular posts paid by your Department. It is inevitable that salaries should be higher in this district than in other parts of Persia where supplies of local produce are more plentiful and cheaper and where nothing in any way comparable to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company exists. Salaries paid to trie Indian and z'ersian staff of the Anglo Persian Oil Company are already high, in addition to which they have the benefit of free housing, free light, free water, free service, free medical attention and free travelling facilities. 5. Though the total emoluments of my staff compare most unfavourably with those of persons holding correspon ding appointments in the Anglo Persian Oil Company and in all other Consular Offices in South Persia it is not on these grounds alone that I have reported the inadequacy of their pay. There has been a steady rise in the actual local cost of living ever since tne present scales of pay were fixed and I consider them to be insufficient. I tnerefore beg to request that the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury may be asked to sanction an increase of 30^ in the basic salary of the Indian Head Clerk -F*- and of the Persian Head Munshi.

Since the above despatches were written, the matter has been discussed with Mr. Consul Watkinson, who is now on leave from Ahwaz in this country and Sir John Simon is satisfied that a revision of trie existing rates of pay is a necessity. The Indian Head Clerk who is a valuable employee and on whom more than usual responsibility rests because of the frequent absences of His Majesty’s Consul on duty, will certainly resign unless his salary is increased. He could not, moreover, be replaced at the present rate of gay • 3. Although actual salaries paid at Ahwaz compare favourably with those at other consular posts in the south of Persia, Sir John Simon is assured that the effect on local wages and of the high rates of pay enjoyed by employees of the Anglo-persian Oil Company considerably outweigh the apparent discrepancy, and for this reason I am to request that/ The Secretary to the Treasury.tnat Tneir Lordenips may be moved to sanction an increase of tne bonus payable on tne salaries of the Head Clerk and Head Munsni from 30 per cent to 55 per cent as from the 1st July 1934, together with a corresponding increase in the office allowance assigned to the post as from that date.

(K 6927/187/234) Sir, 17th October, 1932. Rials 93,528. With reference to Treasury letters E 15925 of the 27th January and the 10th February last regarding office expenditure at His Majesty’s Consulate at Ahwaz, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit herewith, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, a copy of a despatch No. 11 of the 21st May last from His Majesty’s Consul on the subject, together with the usual statement prepared in this department showing the needs of the post as from July 1st last. 2. In view of the steep rise in the cost of living in Persia which, in the view of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, is resulting in great distress among the poorer classes in that country, Sir John Simon considers that the proposed increases should be granted. Certain increased salaries already granted without authority by the Acting British Consul to certain members of the staff have been converted, in the enclosed schedule, to basic salary and a bonus at the rate of thirty per cent, while the salaries of the remaining members of the staff have been included in the estimate at the rates proposed by Mr. Monypenny, with a similar distinction as between basic salary and bonus. 3. I am accordingly to request that Their Lordships may be moved to sanction the assignment to this post of an increased office allowance at the rate of ninety-three thousand, five hundred and twenty eight rials as from the 1st July last. I am, etc., The becretary to the Treasury. (SGD) L. J. SCOTT.fiC 9627/187/234) . No.11. Wi 67-&lt; iS32 British Consulate, Ahwaz. 21st May, 1932. Sir, In accordance with the instructions contained in your despatch No.l (£ 1578/187/234), dated the 4th February 1932, I have the honour to submit a comparative / statement of local prices for the years 1931 and 1932. The cost of living, which as shown in Captain Galloway 1 s Despatch No.2/v/l9 of the 15th June last, had risen to an exceptional extent in this province in recent years, has again further risen quite considerably since last year for the following reasons fa) The continued depreciation in the value of the Kran, (b) The Trade Monopoly Law (Government Monopoly of sugar and matches). fc) Further increases in Customs duties. (d) Almost entire lack of rainfall this winter with the consequent failure of the local crops. In spite of the continued rise in the cost of living no further increase in the salaries of the two senior clerks is requested, owing to the fact that when two new clerks were engaged last year to fill vacancies due to the death of the Head Munshi and the retirement of the Head Indian Clerk, the salaries of all the clerks were revised by Acting Consul Captain Galloway within the total office allowance sanctioned. The two new junior clerks were engaged at a lower wage, the saving thereby effected being used to increase the salaries of the two senior clerks so as to afford them some compensation for fl) Loss on exchange and (2) the fact that they are not in receipt of any pension from the Government of India like the previous incumbents. Following/ The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc*, etc*, etc..

This would necessitate an increase in the Office Allowance of the sanctioned amount from Krans 74484 to Rials 78252. iVith regard to the other items of the Office Allow ance no alteration is necessary except in office rent which has been raised from 350 to 900 krans a month vide your Despatch Ho.123 (R 252v./670/234) dated 24th February 1932, to His Majesty's Minister Tehran.
