I have now had more tirao in which to connider the issues involved and X find that I was in error in agreeing that the whole area ftrom Ahor-el-Odeid to Dhofar was covered by conces sions already granted to Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited. I did make the one exception of the sheikhdom of Fujairah but I should also have noted that the shaikhdom of Ummal Quwaln, the independence of which we have for many years acknowledged, has no form of oil agreement with Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited. 3. There is also the question of tho status of the shaikh- dom of Himriyah which was for many years considered to be under the susereignty of the Shaikh of Sharjah but which has for some considerable period been independent of his control. In this connection please see the correspondence ending with Bushire demi-official letter Ho.1709/14/237 dated the 31st August 1937.

His policy obviously is to Ion Baud is out cN t le way, v/he he : o, rr hope for a larrer share in it than he is at oresent li ; :ely to . obtain. In this I thin : his policy is very sound, and I would not suggest anythin? different to him either in his interests or ours. 3. As regards Jebel Naksh and Nhor-el-Odeid, I cannot a r ree that the oresent rnor.ent is an opportune one for Office have never been more rus1llanimous in their attitude towards him, and des 3ite the fact that we are paying him three million pounds a year to o.o what we want, they ahnear to be completely mesmerised by hin, and would infallibly come out as protagonists on his behalf and arainst Qatar. here agafn by far our best line is to let sleeping dogs lie and hope that when Ibn Baud has disappeared, and our reasons for courtinr his favours have our satisfaction. K. As r • al .•■wain, c rijral an *‘ny-. irm , I a;*fee that wn ipht raise the question a ain o T nluyyiny are really large enough to make it worth while bothering about, but I think that Hamriyah and Fujairah may safely be-••Xe.ft.for the time being.

Our own policy lias been somewhat passive during the twenty-odd years since the Gjair meeting, lbthing seems to have been done to establish the authority oi the Shaikhs, in whose name we speak, over the territories in dispute, although the .Beckett minute of August 29th, 1934 .made such authority the main criterion of sovereignity. . I can only suggest that, in case of a sudden crisis, /e fall bad: on the rattu r unsatisfactory unilateral declaration suggested in paragraphs 43 - 45 of the lenorandum on Frontiers, The politically most comfortable solution would obviously be that vainly'sought in January 1938, for an agreement betv/een the British and American oil interests concerned. The next best, providing for a cession of the Khor-e1-Odeid in exchange for recognition of the Jebel Jakhshas in ater, seems to jg equally unobtainable, and this ight well no longer be admitted as acceptable by Ibn Jaud. 8.

The hinterland frontiers of these territories have, as you know, never been demarked, either upon the ground or by any valid international agreement. It is, at the same time, a matter of considerable interest to this Company to know, even approximately, the inland boundary of the territory \ihich it holds under Concession. Such boundary would, of course, be the frontier as between the territories held on the one hand and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on the other. / The Company is aware, to some extent, of the his tory of successive attempts to agree a frontier with His Majesty King Ibn Baud, from the days of the •1914 line * 4 onwards.

Dear Stock, I am not sure how f f ar the Ministry of Fuel &amp; Power are aware of the comolicated^Question of the South- Eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. The question is dealt with at length in a Foreign Office Memorandum, No.E.2203/ 2203/25 dated June 30th, 1940f Very briefly the nositlon is that in 1935 H.M.G. offered the so called' ''Riyadh Line' to ibn Saud, which offer was rejected mainly (or ostensibly) on account of the Saudi Government's reluctance to give up' their claims to the Jebel Nakhsh, on the western side of the base of the Qatar peninsula, and the Khor el Odeid, an inlet opposite the ^ebel Nakhsh on the eastern side. H.M.G. subsequently considered whether they could meet Ibn Saud by accepting his claims both had to be ruled within the A.I.O.C's and 4 * to one or other of these places but they out - the Jebel Nakhsh because it is (present Petroleum Concessions Ltd's) Qatar concession and Lord Cadman was strongly opposed to any concession on the noint; and the Khor el Odeid because of a promise in 1906 to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi that H.M.G. regarded it as within his territory. 2* There has recently been some correspondence between the Legation at Jedda, the Foreign Office, the Political Resident, the Government of India and ourselves on the question -of the South-Eastern frontiers, The general ooinion has beenthat the present is not a sutiable opportunity for re opening this question. One important aspect, however, about which we have been somewhat in the dark is the intentions of the Oil Companies, both C.A.S.O.C. in Saudi Arabia and P.C.L. in Qatar, the Trucial Shaikhdoms and Muscat. There is the possibility - perhaps the probability - to consider that the question of the frontiers will sooner or later be brought un in an acute form by the operations of the two Oil Comnani.es converging in an area regarded by both as being within the limits of* their own concession. This is perhaps most likely to happen on the Qatar /Saud-i frontier region where we gather Pi that P.C.L. are now going ahead in the Jebel Dukhan area, which contains an established oilfield and from which they may possibly wish to extend their operations to the Jebel Nakhsh .Ve should, therefore be glad of any information you can let us have as to the plans of the respective Oil Companies. ^ P.C.L. were, I think, recently told by the Foreign Office in answer to ^ encuiry by them that it was not possible to give./anyodefInite information about thb-location o' Couth Eastern frontiers of Eaudi Arabia, and they may very possibly know nothing about the disoute about the frontier in the Qatar area since/d.iscussions with Lord Cadman m 1933 were private and confidential. It would therefore not I be desirable for you to say anything to the Company at the moment to suggest that there is any.possibility'of a frontier adjustment with Ibn Saud being negotiated. As regards the Americans it would be ^ven Ifcss desirable to say anything to then in resent circumstances, si ce if it were nut into yi their minds that we were ready to negotiate with Ibn Saud they would no doubt use their influence to nersuade him to assert the most extensive claims he could. ^should also be glad to know whether you have K.I..Stock Esq., 7 anything ‘ 1 Ministry of Fuel &amp; Power, 7, Mi 1 1hr nk• S.wCL. them Z the * • j &lt;J|might win extend bey^rthis^^^Mculirnarro^trabia^teirr; co^e to between the Companies to rpc 0 lu V ',“ J ' a ? 0 } n S 'areas^^^fonofnfo-e 0 ^ disputed anrunex^S the^sharing S perhaps have sore relevance in this connection?' y 5.

EXT.1969/46 MINISTRY OF FUEL AND POWER, Petroleum Division, 7, Millbank, Londoh, S.7.1. 18th I arch, 1946. SECRET Dear Harrison, We have now gone into the question of the alignment of the South Eastern frontiers of ‘Saudi Arabia from the point of view on which you asked opinion in your letter of the 1st March. As to the possibility of the oil operations by the Arabian American Company in Arabia and by Petroleum Concessions Ltd. in Qatar, the Trucial Sheikhdoms and 1 uscat converging, there are two main difficulties in forming an estimate. First and foremost the search for oil throughout this area is, relatively speaking, at a very early stage. Production has admittedly started in Arabia and ^atar, but the number of wells drilled is quite small and the only sure test of oil possibilities is drilling. Modern practice is to preface drilling operations by geological/geophysical exploration which is designed to identify the existence of suitable subsoil^ structures with formations suitable for the presence of oil beneath a seal of permeable strata. This preliminary geophysical survey is, as you know, under way on an extensive^ basis in the concession areas of P.C.L. in South Eastern Arabia, but it will be a year or two before even this preliminary wore begins to show real results, and then the findings will have to be tested by drilling. 'Nothing can be deduced from the surface topography in this part of the world and, pending further development of the programme for testing the nature ^of the subsoil formations, no-one can tell the directions m wi cCh oil development may take place. As regards Petroleum Concessions Ltd., we have a good idea of their programme and I have outlined it broadly above. In essence, it amounts to this; oil has been oroved n Qatar in the Jebal Dukhan area and more structures may well^ be proved anywhere along the coastal strip on the Western sia&lt; of where the oil possibilities are speculativeuntil the Company s programre of geophysical exploration has been completed and the more promising structures tested by sinking a well. As regards the intentions of the Arabian American people are, ^relatively speaking, in the dark. Oil has been or-oved’ at Qatit, Dammam and Abqaiq lying in the coastal area of the Arabian mainland roughly west of Bahrein' Island. How ARAfiCO assess the possibilities elsewhere in their concession area we do^ not know and we have no means of telling where they are likely to concentrate their search in the next year or two' They^have shown some exploration activity at the head of the Bahr As Salwa which is, of course, quite close to the Qatar concession boundary; it is natural that they should be inter ested in the possibilities here in view of the alignment of the structures tn ^atar and Bahrain, but we have no evidence oO show they are c mcentrating on this area more than others. I feel I should mention, at this stage the possibility that .rontier questions may be complicated by the implications of the recent American and Mexican declaration claiming jurisdiction over the sea bed opposite their coasts as far out as the 100 fathom line. If H.i-.G. associates itself with the princioles of the American action the whole of the Persian Gulf will, as you are well aware, come within the definition of M continental as being shallower than 100 fathoms. A partioning of the sea bed of the Persian Gulf would be the logical conclusion and land under the waters of the Gulf of Bahrain seems likely to be an area of prime interest to oil companies. ,J^n r0 ^ g ^ g r SUggest f, that the Possibility does exist v u G 9 ? n( ? operations might converge in the neigh bourhood o_ Balwa v Elsewhere the possibility of overlapping between the operations of the two companies seems relatively remote. V/e have good reason to believe that P.C.L. at present do nov, contemplate exploration ordevelopment in the hinterland ? t ^ e c ? a , st ^ running from the Qatar peninsula through -he Trucial sheikhdoms, Muscat and Oman. Their Views may cnange as they gather knowledge, from their geophysical research, but ’ L ° r Present at any rate, they are not interested in any area lying inland from even the outermost Saudi Arabian frontier discussed in the Foreign Office Memorandum of 30th is mentioned in your letter, i.e. the approxi- ma.e line claimed as a frontier by Ibn S a ud on the 3rd April ^i^ that any pooling or joint operation arrange me.its on the lines contemplated in paragraph 4 of your letter J ? ppea ^ t ° * • or ABAI»:C0. There are no/ trade connec- iions between the American components in each of these croups or between tne two groups themselves; in fact, competition oet.veen .he two is one of the problems of the future. Moreover, joint arrangements of this kind have been ttfied and, in /many cases, have come to grief from internal stresses caused by a f ivergence between the interests of the component groups. The Aneiloonm? 1 . etr0lel i m ^^ission contemplated by the'Anglo- Anerican Oil Agreement might possibly help in finding a ' ?- t0 a conflict of interests of this kind, but, with the will^h^r 0 ?-ft C vJ eS ^' it ls ? pen t0 ^^bt whether the Agreement win be ratiiied by the Americans. the i T ~V r 2 re § oi, ? c ls nec03S arily rather speculative.

State De^ar tanent •nresentatives over here on the Continental Shelf issue as it afiects xha n!-«aa Gulf, and on the question of the Qatar/Saudi Arabia boundary. On the wti'question the Americans enquired uhat was the bate*; position because they £n“bat it was desirable, if possible, to aToid difficult political issues being raised through operations by oil companies which might develop in the 'n^p.d e-band* at the base of the Qatar Peninsula. It has been agreed that the State Department and the British side respectively •oald ascertain from the oil concessionaires in Qatar and Saudi Arabia whether oil oaerations were contemplated in the .neighbourhood of the uncertain Qatar/Saudi Arabia wriarv.. We have found out from Petroleum Concessions United that aoutherracst drilling location under their present programme is about 44Jalosetres north of the Qatar/Saudi Arabia boundary as defined on the map attached to their iareement with the Sheikh of Qatar. Drilling at this location is due to start in the first of 1947 and on its results will depend whether the Gcetpany wil- wish to extend drilling further south. The State Department will, obviously, not be in a position to report on the intentions of the Caltex under their Saudi Arabian concession for some *hile. But it occurs to me that it might be worth considering whether it would be useful to to somewhat further with the State Department towards an arrangement which would dimniah the possibility of uncontrolled oil exploration and possible discoveries in the 'no-man*s-land' area between Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Do you trunk ,ha something on the following lines would be worth while? (a) To discuss in &amp; little more detail with the State Department the uncertainty about the Qatar/Saudi Arabia boundary line. (b) Indicate that, from the point of view of H.M.G.,,we wo^ld not . . wish to recognise the right of Caltex under their Saudi Arabian concession to operate north of the yellow line which was, laid dcwn by in its last discussions with Ibn Saud; and that, in ary event, if Caltex should wish to operate north of this line they „ „ should inform the State Department with a view to discussion with H.Mw. (c) The Americans mi^it wish to know within what sphere P.C.L. would be free to operate under their Qatar concession and we would not wish to disclose the boundary line appearing on the map attached tc their concession. Moreover, one of Ibn Saud*s claims intrudes on the P.C.L. concession area so defined. Would it, however, be fe&amp;sxo-^ the P.C.L. concession line, or some other similar line across the Qatar Peninsula, to the Americans as an informal frontier beyond which we would arrange with P.C.L. that they also would not operate without consulting who would then consult with the State Department r (d) It may be that an arrangement on these lines could ne w oe put into ' ; effort by the State Department via-a-vis Caltex or that the arrangement would ootoe to the ears of, Ibn Saud. On the former point, however, it might be worth at least S^cussing the possibility with the State Department; and on the .-tter point we should have been oon^s tent ith the attitude we took in our last discussions with Ibn and, any case, would we be any worse off 'than without any atwenrpt at an arrangement with the State Department on these lines? Further, withou some such arrangement, there is the risk tnat a discovery cy one o companies may precipitate all these difficulties in a more acute form.It may be that you would feel that this question should be left over until we hear from, the State Department whether Caltex have in mind any investigations in this area. It seems possible, however, that we shall find that the companies will not be pre pared to oosmit themselves and it seems to me that any arrangement on these lines which could be made with the State Department would help towards keeping the position under control* I am sending a copy of this letter to Garran.

Date.Petroleum Concessions Limited, Ling House, Dominion Street, London, E.C.2. 29th April, 1947. The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, Whitehall, S,W.l. Sir, I have the honour to refer to a conversation which took place at the Foreign Office on the afternoon-of 28th April, between tlr. Neville Butler and Lr. Garron on the one side and the undersigned representative of this Company on the other. You are aware that this Company and/or its subsidiaries hold oil Concessions from the Shaikh of Qatar, the various Rulers on the Trucial Coast, and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, which Concessions were acquired at various dates from 1934 to 1945, mainly between 1936 and 1939. It is the common feature of all these Concessions that the territories covered adjoin, on their inland side, the dominions of H. H. King Ibn Sa'ud : and it is understood that the latter’s frontiers, which thus automatically become the boundaries of the Company’s Concession, have never been delimited. In the case of Qatar, the Company's Concession indicates, by a line on an attached map across the Qatar Peninsula from Last to West towards its base, the boundary of the area covered. It is however, believed that considerable territory south of that boundary belongs properly to the Shaikh : and in the event of a delimitation between the domaij(|hs of the Shaikh and of King Ibn Sa'ud, this Company would wish to extend its Concessional area, by arrangement with the Shaikh, so as to cover whatever land might be excluded from Sa'udi Arabia and included in Qatar by the boundary determined. On the Trucial Coast there has been some hinterland demarkation and it would, therefore, be a matter of great interest to the Company to know What approximate or provisional frontier may at the present time be considered as valid vis a vis Sa'udi Arabia : what are the probabilities of a definitive boundary-drawing in the near or fairly near future : and whether in the event of such final boundary drawing including in Sa'udi Arabia areas hitherto and at present considered to belong to the Company's concessionary territories, it could be arranged that King Ibn Sa'ud should agree to respect the Company's 'acquired rights' therein ? The frontier as between the hinterland, the Sultanate of Oman, including its Dhofar Province, and Sa'udi Arabia has similarly never been delimited and is equally a matter of interest to this Company. Hr. Butler asked the undersigned in conversation what would be the Company's order of priority in such boundary delimitation, if it should prove possible to carry it out partially but not wholly. Such order would be, firstly, the boundary at the base of ^atar Peninsula; secondly, the boundary from (the neighbourhood of) the base of ^atar around the outskirts of the Ruba'al Khali passing south of the Crucial Coast and the Oman mountains; and thirdly, the boundary between the Oman Sultanate and Sa'udi Arabia to the South and bouth Last of Ruba'al Khali. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, for PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED. Sdrr\ Vv r ith the compliments of wir. K. L. Stock. My dear Ed, © 13th May, 1947 . II ° Will you please refer to Druitt's letter of the 7 th February to Eric Berthoud enclosing a copy of Loftus* letter about the question of oil drilling and prospecting in the disputed area between Saudi Arabia and Qatar. A copy of this letter was also sent with Chancery letter No. 86/21/47 of the 2 nd February to the Foreign Office. 2 . The hint reported in Loftus' letter of the 6 th February that the Arabian American Oil Company might attempt to force the issue of what their concession does or does not cover, by drilling in the sea bed off the area which is in dispute between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, has been considered • here interdepartmentally and I am writing by agreement with the Foreign Office to let you know the upshot. 3. It seems most undesirable that trouble between j Ibn Saud and the Ruler of Qatar should be stirred up by any independent action-of this kind on the part of the oil companies. It therefore seems necessary to ensure that until some proper frontier settlement can be reached, the sea bed off the disputed zone should be left alon£ by the oil companies concerned in the same way that the disputed land area is being left alone. The best means of securing this on the Saudi Arabia side would, we think, be for us to approach Ibn Saud to explain that modern technical methods make it possible to drill for oil in the sea, to express the view that it is to our common interest that no action should be taken to accentuate the divergence of views about the Saudi/Qatar frontier, and to suggest that he should tell aramco that until a final settlement is reached on this frontier question, his prohibition of the company entering the land area in dispute applies also to their drilling in the sea bed off that area. Similar action would, of course, also be taken by a.iV.G. vis-a-vis I.P.C. operations under their Qatar concession. 4. The Foreign Office have consulted the British Minister in Jedda, who agrees that this approach should be undertaken and that it would serve to revive discussion, if necessary, on this issue in the least controversial way. 5. Before the Minister in Jedda is instructed to approach Ibn Saud, we think that the State Department ought to be informed. We do not imagine that they can have any objection as the proposed action is in line with the understanding reached during the Anglo/American discussions in London last November. Would you now inform them of what we propose to do and let us know when you have done so. ^ 6 . The foregoing has been agreed with the Foreign Office who also agree that you rather than Chancery should make this approach to the State Department. „ 7 : I am sending a copy of this letter to Garran (F.C.), Harrison (I.C.) and Dodds (Admiralty).

As you will see from the note I was unable to identify Jebel Naksh from the air.

As you have visited the spot on the ground I should be grateful if you would kindly confirm this. If Jebel Naksh is the name not of an isolated point but of the whole ridge it would mean that the boundary claimed by Ibn Saud may be much further north than we at present believe to be the case. !

From what one knows of Ibn Saud^ relations with His Majesty's Government, it seems unlikely that he would order his people to challenge the P.C.L. seismic party without first making an offi cial protest, presumably through our Embassy. I agree with you that it is almost certain that he will hear of the party's movements and, I think, the odds are on his making a protest. As you are aware, in this scramble for territory all the rulers concerned are determined to place their claims as high as possible, on the principle that there is nothing to be lost by over-bidding and nothing to be gained by under-bidding.

V*e are copying this letter and its enclosure to the British .Middle East Office and to His Majesty* s Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Yours ever, EASTERN DEPARTMENT. The Chancery, British Embassy, Jedda.(E.1575/605/91) ^ 0 NE IDE l IT IA L TVie South-Eastern Frontier _of Saudi Arabia^ The boundary between Saudi Arabia and the various c-pTtish protected Arab Sheikhdoms and Sultanates stretch ing along the South Eastern coast of Arabia from ^atar on the Persian Gulf to the Aden Protectorate on the Indian Ocean has never been defined by any agreement ;.e ....eerwtis Majesty's Government and the Government of Saudi Arabia. I. The points at issue^ The boundary claimed by the Government of Saudi Arabia is marked in red on the rougn sketch attached. His Majesty's Government originally claimed the boundary rnq-r'ked in blue, but, in the course of intermittent and inconclusive negotiations between 1934 and 1938, offeree one concession after another, of which the latest, the so-called 'Riyadh Line', was proposed in 1930 ano siuh y enhanced in 1937. This is the line marked in black on the attached sketch.' The distance between the ’Riyadh Line' and the Saudi Line is about 120 miles at their point of greatest divergence. The importance of the disputed territory is derived from the petroleum deposits which, it iq believed, may be contained therein. Concessionary rights in the British protected areas are held by three subsidiary companies of the Iraq Petroleum Company, while those in Saudi Arabia are held by the California Arabia Standard Oil Company (now known as Aramco;. As Aramco s concessions extend to the eastern and soutnnrc boan.-ai s of Saudi Arabia, the dividing line between their concessions and those of the Iraq Petroleum Company s subsidiaries is undefined. Additional motives promoting the Saudi Arabian claim are to be found in Ibn Saud s desire to regain territory alleged to have been ruled oy his ancestors and in the potentialities of the knor-el- Odeid as an outlet for an oil pipe line to serve the oil fields in the Hasa province of Saudi Arabia. His Majesty s Government, for their part, have also been influenced by their obligations towards the various Arab rulers concerned and'by their desire to maintain British prestige among these rulers. II. Previous negotiations. The south-eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia was originally regarded as identical with the boundary Oj. oue Ottoman Empire as defined by the Anglo-Turkisn Conventions of 1213 and 1914 (the blue line on the attached sketch; and this assumption was not directly challenged by the Government of Saudi Arabia until 1934. Then, as a result of an enquiry by the United States Embassy in Ankara, His Majesty's Government informed the Governments of the United States and Saudi Arabia that the area south and east of that boundary must be regarded as a British sphere of influence. In reply Ibn Saud declined to accept the validity of these Conventions but expressed his willingness to negotiate. Negotiations were undertaken accordingly and lasted with intervals, until the end of 193b ? since . when the question has remained in abeyance. Luring these negotiations His Majesty's Government proposed five different lines each one representing a further concession, but Ui VHItW*****'hut none of which were acceptable to Ibn Caud. principal obstacle preventing agreement was the baudi Arabian claim to Jebel Naksh and Khor-el-Odeid which, in the opinion of His Majesty*s Government, belong to the r heikh of Qatar and the Sheikh of Abu Chabi respectively. The Jebel Kaksh, whose position is roughly indicated on the attached sketch, is the southern portion of the Jebel Dukhan, a range of hills at whose northern end are the petroleum deposits now being worked by the Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited. No oil has yet been found m the Jebel Naksh itself, but the Company proposes to make a peological survey of the area. In 1938 Sir R. Bullard, then H.M. Minister in Jedda reported that there would be some prospect of reaching agreement on the boundary, provided that His Majesty*s Government were prepared to cede to Ibn Saud either the Jebel Naksh or Khor-el-Odeid. His Majesty*s Government were unable to agree to such a concession and the negotiati^ns^vep allowed to lapse. In the course&gt;erf these negotiations, which are described in detay^in Foreign Office Printed Memorandum No.15996 of 1940fthe Saudi Arabian Government had^advanced two principal arguments in support of their claims: (a) the whole of the coast had once belonged ^o Ibn u^ud s ancestors; (b) the disputed area is inhabited bv nomadic tribes owing allegiance and paying tribute o Ibn wane. The first of these'arguments has never been properly substantiated and, in the opinion of His Majesty s govern ment, does not deserve serious consideration. The second argument, however, has considerable force. Such evidence a /is available tends to show that the country adjoining the Kho Khor-el-Odeid and the Jebel Naksh is inhabited by tribes wno owe allegiance and pay tribute to Ibn s |ud, but wno are robably beyond the effective control of the Sheikhs of Abu iHiabi and Qatar. The allegiance of the tribes inhabiting the rest of the frontier area is more dubious, but it may safely be said that nowhere in the disputed area are tne inhabitants under the effective control of the rulers on whose behalf His Majesty*s Government have claimed sovereignty up to the 'Riyadh Line'. Short of themselves establishing or causing to be established, effective control over the disputed area, there is no conclusive reply which His Majesty*s Government Ccai make to this argument. The Anglo-Turkisn Conventions of 1913 and 1914 do not bind King Ibn Saud to refrain from extending his sovereignty beyond the boundaries fixed therein, nor is Article Six of the Treaty of Jedda of 1927 by any means sufficient, though helpful. By this Article tne Government of Saudi Arabia undertook to: maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast, who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty.' His Majesty’s Government nave, in the past, contended that this undertaking committed the Saudi Arabian Government to acceptance^oi the boundaries ox those States, as they then existed. Since these bounaar-i-es have never been defined, the value of this argument is dubious except in the case of Khor-el-Odeid. Ihe right o the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi to this territory was specifically recognised by His Majesty*s Government as early as 1906 and it can be contended that the Saudi Arabian Government are similarly committed by the Treaty of Jedda. TheThe arguments advanced by ills Majesty*s Government qnd the Government of Saudi Arabia in support of their respective claims are fully set out in Foreign PfMce Printed Memorandum No.15997 of 1940 . v * J III. Commitments and Interests of His Majesty 1 * Governments The specific commitments of His Majesty’s Government nre in respect of certain portions only of the disputed ^ea Having offered Ibn Baud the 'Riyadh Line', they could presumably not claim any territory beyond that boundary. On the other hand, His Majesty's Government are under no legal obligation to resist the Saudi Arabian claims at any point except the Khor-e3-Odeid. This area was recognised by His Majesty's Government as belonging to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and*', in 1906, they undertook to prevent its occupation by anyone else. His Majesty's Government promised the Sheikh of Qatar protection against serious and unprovoked attacks on his territory from outside his frontier, but the Sheikh was not told what His Majesty's Government regarded as the boundary of his territory. Legally, therefore, His Majesty's Government are under no obligation to resist an attack by Ibn Saud on the Jebel Naksh. Morally, however, the Sheikh has a strong claim to Britisn support, since the original promise of protection was given to him in return lor the oil concession, which includes the Jebel Naksh. To the Trucial Sheikhs His Majesty's Government have promised no more than that 'if any shall attack them the British Government shall take notice of it', although in 1903, when Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon assured them: ' if you behave well, His Majesty's Government will protect you against all comers', and to the Sultan of Muscat they have promised nothing at all. A promise made to the Sultan of Muscat in 1939 of protection against external aggression was condi tional upon the aggression 'resulting from a war in which His Majesty's Government are engaged' and is no longer considered binding. Most of the treaties concluded between His Majesty's Government and the tribes and rulers the Aden Protectorate did, it is true, extend to them the gracious favour and protection of His Majesty s Government but, the boundaries of their territories never having been defined, His Majesty's Government are still left with scope for concession or compromise. With the single exception of the Khor-el-Odeid, His Majesty's Government are thus free to v/eigh against eac other the conflicting claims of friendship with Saudi Arabia, on the one hand, and of the British Oil Companies and British prestige among the Arab rulers of South-^ast nrauia on the other. No evidence is yet available about the extent, or even the existence of petroleum deposits in zne disputed area. Geological surveys are now in progress on the Trucial Coast and in Dhofar. Dhofar is included m the territory claimed by the Sultan of Muscat and recen« evidence suggests that its inhabitants do, in fact own allegiance to him and have already been undertaken, without success, in the coastal area of Muscat. It is hoped that oil may be found in the interior of Muscat, but survey parties have not yet been able to penetrate that region. The oil company has so far refrained from exploring the Jebel Naksh, at His Majesty's Government's request, in order to avoid pro voking Ibn* Saud. Until the whole area has been properly surveyed,- 4 - c r&gt; 9 urveyed, the importance of its oil bearing possibilities as a factor influencing His Majesty's Government's policy cannot be assessed. The imnortance of maintaining jfritish prestige among the A.rab rulers of South-East Arabia is determined primarily bv strategic considerations. Although the Ministry of Defence decided in 1946 that this area was unsuitable for a major base, the coastal areas might provide minor naval bases and airfields, whose value would be enhanced in time of war, particularly if the opposite side of the Persian Gulf were occupied by hostile forces. There are alrea four airfields in this area, of which two, Sharjah and Masirah, are important, while the others Riyan and ualala , would only be required for short-range purposes and are only on a care and maintenance basis. Two sloops of the Roval Navy are permanently on this station and the .loyal Navy also make use of Masirah. His Majesty s government can reasonably expect to obtain greater concessions J rom ne Sheikhs and Sultans who now control the coastal area than from a major Arab ruler like Ibn oaud. On tne other hand, n these minor Arab chieftains find that His Majesty s Govern- ment are unable or unwilling to protect them against encroachment by Ibn Saud, they may be tempted to look els - where for such protection or even to accept Saudi suzerainty. The Sultan of Muscat, for instance, when asked uy ..is Majesty's Government what he considered the limits Oi his domain, claimed a boundary which, at some points, i^lis short of the 'Riyadh Line' but which everywhere exceeds the ’ine claimed by Tbn Saud. He would presumably reluctant to agree to any further concessions of his terri- to~y,to Ibn Saud. Moreover, British reluctance to upholo the' claim of Arab rulers in this area P re ^ (3 f ce ^ relations of His Majesty's Government with the states o. Koweit and Bahrein, whose petroleum deposits are oi considerable importance. IV. The Policy sl Bis Majes ty's Governments Since 1938 His Majesty's Government have preferred to allow the whole question to remain in abeyance ano his Majesty's representatives in Jedda and the ; J e.sian Gulf have consistently advised against any attempt to re0 P e r n 1 • While His Majesty's Government have nothing to 1hl oon-Mmilne thi 4 ? policy, circumstances may ma^e it impossloie. Petroleum^Coneession(Oman and Dhofar) Ltd are already carry, incr rmt ppolopical surveys in Dhofar up to the Hi adh Line 9 ' while Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ud. j^^^^lies permission to make a survey of tne oebe^. NaLsh which lie. within their concession area. Aramco are no. known ; a env nlan« for exploration in the disputed area, hut the., VZ anxious to clarify the boundaries of the concessions granted to'them by the Saudi Arabian Government andmightbe tempted to start drilling in order to force the issue* ^icr. action could hardly be Ignored by His Majesty s Governmen . Similarly, if the operations of.British Companies were come to T&amp;n Saud's notice, he might be provoked into reopening the frontier question. The danger exists, therefore, that ^is Majesty's Government might be unable to maintain tneir Present policy. Three alternative policies have, in the past, been considered: (a) 1 '‘Riyan is in the Aden Protectorate south of the area shown on the sketch attached to this memorandum.5 (a) A unilateral declaration by His Majesty*s Government that they regard the 'Riyadh Line' as the boundary; (b) An attempt to obtain Ibn Gaud's acceptance of the 'Riyadh Line' in exchange for the cession of the Khor-el-Cdeid; (c) An attempt to shelve the question by inducing Aramco and Petroleum Concessions (^atar) Ltd., to agree to Joint exploitation of the Jebel Naksh. Of these proposals (a) was rejected as prejudicial to Anglo-Saudi friendship and (b) as contrary to our under taking to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and, therefore, . prejudicial to British prestige.* It is, moreover, doubtfu. whether Ibn Gaud would be satisfied with the Khor-el-Odeid. Cc) foundered on the refusal of the British Company to share their concession with Aramco. The American Company was not consulted and it is by no means certain that they would be prepared to accept such a compromise. Even if they were, this would not dispose of Ibn Gaud's claims to the Jebel Naksh but would, on the contrary, encourage them, even if it also induced him to refrain from pressing them. The situation may, of course, be altered if the geological surveys now contemplated or already in progress should end in the discovery that no petroleum deposits do in fact exist within the disputed area. Even this would not, however, dispose of Ibn Gaud's claims though it might considerably weaken His Majesty's Government's motives for opposing them. (SGD.)

The argument that the receipt of z&amp;k&amp;t implies sovereign rights we cennot, I am afraid, escape. We have used it ourselves on the Trucial Coast. At the same time It cannot be held th*t where there is no control there is no sovereignty. The cese of Sharjah and the Beni Qitab is in point. For our own ends.to a great extent we have there insisted on treating dharjah as the overlord when his w feudatory w could easily be independent of him and wuld be if we gave him the slightest encouragement.

I have been finding out the extent of our actual operations in the southern parts of the Qatar Peninsula. The boundary specified in the map attached to the Concessions. v/as marked on the ground, in 1940, by concrete pillars - or at least the western half of it; cur people have always been most careful not to go south of this. The recent geophysical (seismic) parties who have been exploring there in’the 1947/48 season have, I find, covered the whole of the western half rifht up to our Concession boundary, and after a period of great activity they have now withdrawn and are unlikely to return in the near future. Nor is there any early prospect of drilling in the south-western corner. The only continuing activity which we have in the area which you showed me as included in Ibn Saud’s 1935 claimed line, is the extraction of gypsum which we have been takeing for some time past from a point fairly far south in the area shown in your pap as Jebel Nakhsh; nobody seems to have raised any objection to this. That therefore is the present situation with which I promis ed to acquaint you. I am sending a copy of this letter to Dr. Nuttal. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) Stephen Longrigg.

According to information obtained from Shaikh Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi and certain bedouin of the Manasir whom he consulted, the Mukhadhabah are an offshoot of the Khiyareen, a subsection of the Beni Fajir.

'According to information obtained from Shaikh Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi and certain bedouin of the Kanaslr whom he consulted, the Mukhadhabah are an offshoot of the Khiyareen, a sub* section of the Beni Hojir.

It will be seen from this that the seismic survey terminated considerably north of the Concession boundary, but if it is a fact that gypsum is being mined very close to Jabal Naqsh it is significant that no complainl about this has been received from the Saudi authorities. We are in some doubt hepe whether the term 11 Jabal Naqsh' refers to some particular point or to the whole collection of low hills in the area concerned. Possibly the Saudi authorities may also be unaware of its exact location. There is no very prominent feature. 3 e We are sending a copy of this letter to His Majesty s Ambassador Jeddah and asking Mr. Lermitte kindly to le_t us have another copy of the map to forward to him.

It would appear that a gravimetric survey party operated by Aramco and based at Salwah are using the track marked red on the map to get to and from Khor Odaid. As will be seen from the map the road runs north to Jabal Nagsh, south to within 500 metres of M23 Qalat Al Araej, and then almost in a straight line to Khor Odaid passing 5 Km. south of M33 Krefi. From Jabal Nagsh the road is for the whole of its length inside our Concession limits.

This area is of great importance to us and we are perturbed by the activities of the Aramco party operating on the Qatar side of the Concession Boundary.

There would be advantage in settling the problem as a whole so as to avoid fresh discussions at a later date about the boundary of Aden Protectorate and it is possible that the Kingdom of Ibn oaUd may now be read y to reach a general settlement. An additional reason lor negotiating any settlement of the whole boundary is that Ibn Saud appears to have designs on Euraimi over which the Sultan of Muscat has so far been unable to establish proper control. While Burelmi is nominally no concern of ours, we should find it awkward if the Saudis were established in the angle between Trucial Sheikhdoms and the Sultanate of Muscat and the British oil company now seeking to establish itself in Buraimi area would be shut out by .Aramco* 3. On the other hand Saudi Arabia may possibly disAntAtrate on Ibn baud's death and If we settle the whole boundary now we nay find that it runs through the middle of an area whi£h owes allegiance to no ruler or in which a new tribal ruler may arise claiming subjects on both sides of the boundary. This possibility may tend to recommend limited agreement. Another consideration is thatH.14.G. have no responsibility for foreign relations of Muscat and in negotiating the whole boundary behalf and must consult his wishes. we shall be acting on his 4. In the circumstances of today it is perhaps unrealistic to counter the Saudi arguments based on the use of wells grazing grounds an collection of taxes which, as far as the interior of th * 1}eninsula js conceuned, we are \mableto confirm or refute, by drawing straight lines across the map of the desert; nevertheless subject to your advice, I think we might try for a general settle- on the basis of the 'Riyadh line” of November 1935 which was oST* Inst formal oiler to the Saudis. If this attempt fails it might be practical to propose that discussions should be limited to the area bordering the Trucial Coast. On this basis the discussion might deal with the boundary from Kasr-es-Salws to points where the 'Riyadh l 1 rife” reaches the 56th degree longtitude. Presumable howevei it would be preferable not to Qpen discussions on basis of the ”Riyadh line” H.M.fl. would ask for something in advance of it and w€ might begin by stating our claim to the 'Brown line” of June 1935 # 5. If agreement is stixl not in sight it would be normcil perhaps to identify a commission of investigation; but I am doubt ful whether such a commission is practicable in this case. H.M.G. might find it difficult to appoint suitable commissioners or to provide them with adequate guards. If the guards were provided they night quarrel with quarrel with the Saudi guards, while if they were not the Saudi guards would easily intimidate the inhabitants of the localities being investigated. I shall be grateful for your views on this matter or on how we might proceed if the conversations fail to secur agreement on the 'Riyadh line”. 6 .

It may perhaps be that on reconsideration of these claims, so^e may ■--ppear more essential than ever, but there may be other parts of one frontier where we feel that some concession to the Saudis might now be made if it would secure Saudi acquiescence in the claibs which we consider really essential, and as regards which our legal ground is strongest. From the 1940 memoranda, it appears for in stance that ih 1938 the Foreign Office reached the conclusion that : ne minimum price of any agreement would be the cession of either lebel Fakhsh or the Khor al ‘Odaid. The latter area will now unfortun tely have become more valuable to both parties as a result of the oil proppects but perhaps the Jebel Nakhsh on the other hand will present less difficulties now that a major oilfield has been found further north in the peninsula and it is no longer true that the 'Jebel Nakhsh is about the only part of ^.atar which is belie ved to have potential value as an oilfield' (please see paragraph 25 of the me mcrandum of June 1940 on the 'iouth Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia). / vu ^ (Jr * *1 /e.

' tn wou - 1(i a B._ I hope that you will not think it premature to raise these points and I realise that it probably is not possible to siv® a complete answer on tnem all. It seems to me, however, tbit 'until we have considered these problems it is difficult to deciL’e“n regards the tactics of the negotiations. For instance, the Ambassador in his telegram No. 108 of the 11th May recorprended t : ?at we should tackle the frontier questions one' by one, whereas H£ y telegram 717 of the 14th May recommended .hat we should try to reach a general settlement. The best argu ment for trying to reach a general settlement would, I suggest, be if we found on re-examining the problem that we could now offer the Saudis a considerable new concession in one area which might induce them to accept our claims in other areas more important to us. If, for instance, we could offer them relatively large slices of territory beyond the Riyadh Line opposite Muscat or the Hadhramaut, it might perhaps make them more amenable as regards the disp» ted frontier with ^atar and Abu Dhabi, even thought the territory which we offered them might be desert and of little practical use. If, on the contrary, our final view is that the most we can offer to the east of the Riyadh Line would be r, a small area in the south western corner of the ^atar peninsula” as Sir Rupert Hay’s telegram No.217 suggests (and he told me that he does not mean by this that we can give way as regards Jebel Fakhsh itself), then our view here is that we should have more chance of making progress if we negotiated on the frontier claims piecemeal. This is apparently also the Saudi view, since Fuad Hamza told me at Riyadh that he thought that it would be best to negotiate first of all as regards only the northern section of the disputed frontier as this would be easier to settle than would the frontier further east where the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi was, he said, ’’claiming Buraimi although the area was really control led by a rival Shaikh.” Incidentally, you should also know that Fuad hinted to us that the Saudis would probably be quite glad to see Thesiger in, but would like the oil companies definitely kept out, of the negotiations.44 16 An/ •SB .account Pf P-evia^, ngaotutiaia be tw fiP .n SlsJla.ie^y’s Q9Yfjrnm--ait u , m i_ ti ie Mvarmgnt .sn^l^aiL the So U th-R aR t.^ Bovinclaries of Sa\ia.l Arnb^n, ,., I1 ? n ‘faud, v/ho made himself master ofldyadh in 1902 did n°t attempt to extend his dominions to fhfeast until he ^ e f ceria ° a on Hasa, captured the central oasis and ten days later entered Qatif. (May 1913). A year later he concluded a treaty with the Ottoman Government hy which he was accorded the title of Vali of Najd in return for an acknowledgement that he was an Ottoman suTD^GCt suid. tlie servant of the Ottoman Government# Meanwhile His Majesty’s Government had concluded two Conventions with the Turkish Government ( 29 th July, 1913 and 9th March 191U) in which the South-Eastern boundaries of the Ottoman Empire were defined. The agreed boundaries were the so-called Blue and Violet lines (see map II;. No mention was made in the Conventions of the sovereignty of the territory to the east and south of these lines, except that the Blue line was stated to separate the Ottoman Sanjak of Najd from the territory of El Katr (Qatar), in which Turkish rights were renounced and His Majesty 1 s Government were clearly free, so far as the Ottoman Empire was concerned, to extend their influence and authority© The small Turkish post at Dohah had been increased by troops from Hasa in 1913 but all were withdrawn to Basrah before the out break of the 1914 - 18 War. Prom 1914 to 1918 the frontier question had lain dormant in its larger issues. In 1922 when Sir Percy Cox met Ihn Saud at Ojair in order to induce him t&lt;r ratify the Treaty of Muhammerah of 5th May 1922, regulating frontier and other questions between Iraq and Najd, he discovered that Ibn Saud was proposing to grant to a body called the Eastern and General Syndicate a concession over an area including the Qatar peninsula. The south-western and southern boundaries of this area are shown on the map II ('Ojair line') Sir Percy Cox told Ibn Saud at the time that the proper line of the Qatar-Najd frontier was from Qasr~as-t;. 7 va to the head of the Khor-al-Odsid (Map l), and he drew this line on the map. The Blue line was not mentioned at this meeting through Sir Percy Cox explained that Ibn Saud could not include in any concession territory to the east of Ahbak (abiout 25 miles south of the southern tip of the Dohat-os-Salwa) * In 1934 the matter again came under consideration in connexion with the development by the Standard Oil Company of California of their concession in Hasa and with negotiations between the Anglo-Persian Oil ompany and the Shaikh of Qatar. The view was taken Anglo-Turkish Convention of 19x4, which had been ratified and had defined both the Blue and Violet lines, ,,a ‘ J legally binding on Ibn Saud in his c ^^vty as successo. to the Ottomah Enpire, He was so ® £°^ ed dated 28th April 1934. In his reply he c °ntested the validity of the frontiers laid down, on the ground that the Ottoman Government had no British his ancestral homeland. A restatement o /thesis...no locus standi in the matter after Ihn Saud's occupation of Hasa on 13th April* 1913« east to a point on the coast seven miles north of the Khor-el-Odeid, thus leaving the latter in Saudi-Arahia, fMap l). The proposed boundary started again from a point in the Persian Gulf about sixteen miles south of the Khor-el-Odeid (see Map II). In reply Ibn Saud was offered in full sovereignty a relatively small strip of territory immediately to the oast of the Blue line (ta&lt;~ Green line on Maps I and II) - Further consideration of the question in the light 'of information from the Resident in Aden led His Majesty s Government to propose a further concession of which Ibn Saud f s Deputy Foreign Minister was informed in London during discussions in June and July 1935* He had made it clear that Ibn Saud was not prepared to consider the former offer as a basis for a settlement, and criticise both proposals on the ground that they were purely arbitrary and not in accordance with the material facts of the situation in the desert. He maintained that Ibn Saud f s demands were formulated on the basis of the grazing grounds of four tribal groups (the Ahl Muij^a, Beni Hajir, the Dimman and part of the Manasir) whic.u acknowledged Ibn Baud’s sovereignty. In reply it was pointed out that there was a wide difference between the extreme limits of a tribe’s wanderings and the actual territory in which a tribe was predominant and that the question of allegiance was ono which could not always be settled decisively. In these discussions it became apparent that a deadlock was likely over the northern sector of the frontier and there appeared to be no real hope that Ibn Saud would abandon his claim to the Jebel Nakhsh and Khor-el-Odeid, However, Fuad Bey was informed that His Majesty’s Government would give full and fair consideration to Ibn Baud’s claims and that the reply to his two communications would be returned through His Majesty’s Legation at Jeddah. Sir Andrew Ryan visited Ibn Saud at Riyadh in November 1935 by v/hich time the information supplied by /Fuad.••Paad Bey regarding the 'dima 1 * n-p +v^ + --u allegiance Ibn Sand claimed had trit) es 'hoae light of answers to enquiries made rvp e ?h mine +v in in the Persian OnTf' ena + 1 , f 1 ma de of the authorities ‘ too ± eroian uulf and the Aden Protectorate Aa a demand for a boundary extending to the Persian r^?e »»=+ of Qatar. The botindary thus offered (which. Sir A. Ryan was instructed to emphasise to Ibn Saud represented nrenntd &gt; ltS 1 ° WhiCh , HiS Gwern^ent were prepared to go) was defined in a note of 25 th November 1935 and is known as the 'Riyadh line 11 (Maps I and II)# On 17 th May 1935| after long negotiations, a concession was granted to the Anglo-Iranian Oii Company i + l i0 Shaikh ol Qatar in which the southern boundaries °f the concession area were shown on a map by a line, later known as the 'concession line', which ran south of the Jebel Naksh to a point about eight miles north of the Khor el Ode id (Map I), At this time His Majesty^s Government, for the guidance of their own representatives, had laid down a line within which Protection would be afforded to the Shaikh of Qatar under certain conditions (the 'protection line' Map I), Ibn Saud protested direct to the Shaikh of Qatar against his grant of an oil conces sion before a^ settlement of the question of the south eastern frontiers had been reached, Hs was subsequently informed through Shaikh Yusuf Yasin lihat the concession area lay in territory to which His Majesty^ Government could admit no rights of the Saudi Government and that His Majesty f s Government had promised protection to the Shaikh of Qatar against agression, in particular of the oil concession area ( 26 th September 1935)• The offer of the 'Riyadh line' was immediately rejected by Ibn Saud, mainly on account of his reluctance to give up claims to the Jebel Naksh and the Khor-el- Odeid, the cession of which His Majesty’s Government were unable to contemplate. The Khor-el-Odeid had for long been recognised as the property of the Shai&amp;h of Abu Dhabi and the Jebel Naksh, forming part of a larger range of hills called the Jebel Dukhan, belonged to the Shaikh of Qatar, and (an overriding consideration) was included in the concession to the Anglo«»Irajiian Oil Company, granted before Ibn Saud's proposal showing that his claims extended so far. The claim to the Jebel Naksh was based on the argument that the local tribes owed allegiance to Ibn Saud and that to the Khor-el-Odeid partly on the same argument and partly^ on its importance to Saudi Arabia as a^port, .possession of which would prevent smuggling into Saudi Arabia, This was before the development of Ras Ta?\ura as a port which has presumably invalidated this part of the Saudi argument, . In the Riyadh discussions Sir A, Ryan restated the objection of His Majesty’s Government to Ibn Saud s direct correspondence with the Shaikh of Qatar on matters concerning foreign affairs, to which excep ' - . /had,..had been taken earlier. Fuad Bey did not contest the aliments but countered with a suggestion that the Shfikh of Qatar'had recognised Ibn Baud's right to the Haksh rrior’to the Anglo-Qatar Treaty of 1916. This alle-ed agreement led to a discussion lasting for several monthl during 1936. The Shaikh of Qatar denied any recollection of such an agreement but thought that Thn Baud or Ibn Jiluwi (the Governor of Hasa) might have asked permission to collect 'zakat-'Ctribute) from Saudi tribesmen grazing their flocks and herds near the Jebel Dukhan. Eventually it appeared that Ibn Saud Sand did not endorse Fuad Bey’s statement about the pre -1916 agreement. However, in January 1937'Sir Reader Bullard who had succeeded Sir A Ryan at Jeddah, was instructed to inform Fuad Bey that His Majesty’s Government regarded both the Jebel Nalfsh and the Khor-el-Odeid as essential and to ask him on what other parts of the frontier he thought joint proposals could be formulated likely to appeal to Ibn Saud and to His Majesty’s * Government. Meanwhile he was to be told that the possibility of offering further slight concessions on the borders of Muscat^ and the Aden Protectorate under consideration. Fuad Bey appeared to know not ing whatever about the Muscat frontier but gave the impression that the Saudi Arabian Government might be prepared to effect a compromise over the frontier of the Aden Protectorate. He was accordingly shown a copy of the tribal map of the Aden Protectorate which demonstracted the fact that the point at which the line put forward by the Saudi Arabian Government would be nearest to the sea, viz., the junction of 52° East and 17° North, would fall within territory ethnographically belonging'to Aden Protectorate.tribes. (Map II). Fuad Bey, always an exponent of the tribal basis of territorial claims, merely made the personal suggestion that the point under discussion should be moved further north in such a v/ay, however, as to leave the Shishur and Tadhan wells in Saudi territory. He further alleged (though erroneously) that these two wells had been included in a list of waterinTg-places belonging to the Ahl Murra communicated to His Majesty’s Government in 1933 and promised to ascertain the basie of the claim to them and to two others called Sanau and Thamud. He never did so. On' 12th February Sir R. Bullard wrote to Fuad Bey that evidence (from Bertram Thomas’s ’’Arabia Felix”) seemed to show that all four wells were in the territory of tribes to which Ibn Saud made no claim, and that the Ahl Murra did not come as far south as these wells. In 1937 Sir R. Bullard and Mr. Rendel, the head of the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office had prolonged discussions at Jeddah with Shaikh Yusuf Yasin and Shaikh Hafiz Wohba the Saudi Arabian Minister in London , stressing the physical relation of ‘the Jebel WAKStf HaXe# to the Jebel Dukhar in the Qatar peninsula.. Yusuf Yasin repeated the old argument about tribal allegiance though he said that Ibn Saud, if the Jebel Naksh were given to him, would abandon even more extensive claims he might make in that quarter. Mr. Rendel replied that the integrity of the peninsula must be maintained and urged that, as Ibn Saud’s claim to the Jebel Naksh /had.•had eomo at an advanced stape in tho ^ • was a complete surprise to Hi cm .“® discussions and was not worth imperilling a ■'ettfom 3t + 8 G ? ver ument it Of Khor-el-Odeid he said that h I' 111 '? 11 '*' on its account, might he done to meet Ihn San^® hoped something careful study of the record 1 W i S ^ e3 but tha t a years it had formally hoen^recomi-o^n* t° r over sixt y Government as pert of Ahu Dhabi? in 1Q06 wf M , £ f J ! sty ' f Government had entered into -n ,’n^o 19 °: Hls M adeQty's of Abu Dhabi to recognise the a?e?

He saidfurther that the boundary of Qatar was well known to be Araik • although, unfortunately, this place did not appear on’ the accessible maps. Immediately after this interview oir R. Bullard wrote to Shaikh Yusuf Yasin stating that ? n _^ in the possession of His Majesty 1 s Legation at' deadan, Araik was situated between Qasr-es-Salwa and th^ Jebel Maksh and enquiring whether Ihn Saud^ defi.._. did not, on this basis, leave the Jebel Naksh to Qatar. Ibn Sauds reply was that he was not referring to the Araik of Naksh' but to the one 'lying south of Dukhan', and that, anyhow, his statement was incidental and did not concern the details of the case. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company transferred their Qatar rights to Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited (a subsidiary of Petroleum Concessions Limited) on 5th February 1937 and this njw company were hoping to begin prospecting in the south-western area of the Qatar peninsula. The desirability of a settlement of this boundary was increased by this fact and tho possibility was considered of a unilateral declaration by His Majesty's Government defining the line which they regarded as the boundary. At the end of June 1937 it was decided not to pursue this suggestion at least until the oil companies had decided to start prospecting and exploitation in the disputed areas. The Foreign Office^ favoured a suggestion whiich Sir R 0 Bullard had made that a rough topographical survey of the Jebel Naksh area should be made by a special joint commission on which a representative of the Shaikh of Qa’tar would have to be included. This proposal did not mature. Meanwhile the possibility of making some additional concession in the area between parallels 17^. and 18 , and particularly to the west of meridian 51 was under examination from the point of view of the limits* of the area over which Aden tribes had indubitable claims rather.» e.. PT , than w ith the intention of excluding ibn Saud from rather than wi™ ^ ownership was completely districts of w utmost concession on this basis indeterminate. £ a politically wise appeared to which could be. cons ... wide by 300 miles long be a strip of desert ^ of His His Majesty 1 s Governmen de Q i(i ed that the balance VtlZLtafe lti in leaving the question of the southern boundary in abeyance for a time. HI fiS ” 1 to the Political Agent £he Sultan stated^ ^ ^ ISSd wTlS''2S of oSLfn point. (0. D, E, G H Map II). Tn «pntember 1937 the Political Agent at Bahrain expressed apprehension about efforts by Ibn Saud to establish his authority at Baraimi, an oasis lying at font Of the northern end of the western slope of Western Haiar range. Both the Sultan of Muscat and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi have claims based upon author! y over tribes of tSe oasis and Ibn Saud would apparently base a claim on its occupation by hl s Sno 68 * 0 ^ 8 f° r nearly 70 years up to the 18th June, 1869 when the Wahhabis were expelled from Baraimi by the combined action of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and the ^Itan ox Muscat. Baraimi, however, lies far outside the extreme limit of the eastern frontier which Ibn Saud had been claiming. The question of the Jebel Haksh, which had lapsed for several months, revived when news was received that the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company were showing activity in the neighbourhood of Qasr-es-Salwa. ChWftn November 1937 instructions were sent to His Majesty s Minister. Jeddah, which formed the basis of a note which he addressed to the Saudi Arabian Minister of Foreign Affairs.* In this note he informed the Minister of Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Government had receivea reports of the activities of CASOC in the neighbourhood of Qasr-es-Salwa and added that they were prepared to reopen negotiations for a settlement on the lines already indicated and that ’’they assume that in the meantime no attempt will be made by the Californian Arabian Company to pass the line defined in the latest proposals of His Majesty’s Government to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, so long as no final agreement has been reached as to that line • The note also contained a ■ proposal for a joint topographical mission ”to establish on the spot the exact nature and position” of ’’certain physical features” of which the precise position was Sir R. Bullard informed the Foreign Office by telegram as soon as the note was delivered in order that they might explain the position informally to the company’s representative in London, while he himself made a similar communication to their Jeddah representative. According to the accounts of Fuad Bey and Shaikh Yusuf Yasin Ibn Saud was extremely displeased and considerable discussion followed. On 30th December 1937 Sir R. Bullard reported that the Saudi attitude on the /question.••I nr' 2 say that public and parliamentary opinion in Rmrior,/i r*. say nothing of world opinion) would never tolenaf 8 d to territory that derived from commerce inhuml!* 8 claim We could presumably whip up a lot of evidence on , running without compromising the Rulers too bad]v d / T ® lave * the oaudis asked why we had not suppressed the oif* ^ we might quote the case of A1 Capone and bear mind against a possible protest It our proved IraTbegion). .f 0 far as h °isting Saudi flags is concerned t d^ think the answer lies in Stobart's sueeesticv not '^h-towers.

ARAMCO INCURSIONS©aoh one representing a further concession, but none of which were acceptable to Ibn SautiU The principal obstacle preventing agreement was the Saudi Arabian claim to Jebel Naksh and Khor-el-Odeid which, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, belong to the Sfelk of Qatar and the Sheik of Abu Dhabi respectively• The Jebel Naksh, whose position is roughly indicated on the attached sketch, is the southern portion of the Jebel Dukhan, a range of hills at whose northern end are the petroleum deposits now being worked by Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited, No oil has yet been found in the Jebel Naksh itself, but the Company proposes to make a geological survey of the area. In 1933 -&gt;ir Rr cullard, then H.M. Minister in Jedda, reported thi t there would be some prospect of reaching agreement on the boundary, provided that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to cede to Ibn Baud either the Jebel Naksh or Khor-el-Odeid. His Majesty’s Government were unable to agree to such a concession and the negotiations were allowed to lapse. In the course of these negotiations, which are described in detail in Foreign Office Printed Memorandum Ho. 15996 of 1940, the Baufil Arabian Government had advanced two principal arguments in support of their claims! (a) the whole of the coast had once belonged to Ibn Baud’s ancestors; (b) the disputed area is inhabited by noraadio tribes owing allegiance and paying tribute to Ibn Baud. The first of these arguaents has never been properly substantiated and, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, docs not deserve serious consideration. The second argument, however, has considersole force# Such evidence as is available tends to show that the country adjoining the Khor-el-Odeid and the Jebel Naksh is Inhabited by tribes who owe allegiance and pay tribute to Ibn Seud, but who are probably beyond the effective control of the Sheiks of Abu Dhabi and ^tar. The allegiance of the tribes inhabiting the rest of the frontier area is more dubioue, but it may.safely be said that nowhere in the disputed area are the inhabitants under the effective control of the rulers on whose behalf His Majesty’s Government have claimed sovereignty up to the 'Riyadh Line”. Short of themselves establishing, or causing to be established, effective control over the disputed area, there is no conclusive reply which His Majesty’a Government can make to this argument. The Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 do not bind King Ibn Baud to refrain from extending his sovereignty beyond the boundaries fixed therein, nor is Article Six of $he Treaty of Jedda of 1927 by any means sufficient, though helpful. By this Article the Government of Saudi Arabia undertook to: 'maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the .Sheiks of Qatar and the Oman ooaet, who are in special treaty relations with Kis Britannic Majesty.' 1 His Majesty's Governmert, have, in the past, contended that this undertaking oofl*nitt**c the Saudi Arabian Government to acceptance of the boundaries of those states, aw they then existed. Since these boundaries have never been defined the value of this argument is dubious except in the case of Khor-el-Cdeid. The right of the Swell of Abu Dhabi to this territory was specifically recognised by His Majesty’s Government as early as 1906 and it can be contended that the Saudi Arabian Govei»nment are similarly committed by the Treaty of Jedda. The arguments advanced by His Majesty’s Government andstrategic oonaiderations.

Their terms were not communicated at the time to Ibn baud or to any other third party. Meanwhile, in May 1914. Ibn baua himself concluded a treaty with the Ottoman Government, by which he was accorded the title of V ali of Nejd in return for an acknowledgment that he was an Ottoman subject and the servant of the Ottoman Government No mention was made m the Conventions of the sovereignty of the territory to the east and south of the Blue and Violet lines, except that the Blue line was stated to separate the Ottoman Sanjak of Nejd from the territory of El Katr (Qatar). But it was clearly territory in which His Majesty’s Government were thereafter tree, so far as the Ottoman Empire was concerned, to extend their influence and authority. ’&gt;• frontier question, which had, in its larger issues, lain dormant since E. 279 / 279 / 1914, was mised indirectly in November 1922, when Sir Percy Cox. the Hioh 91(1934). Commissioner in Mesopotamia, met Ibn Sand at Ojair in order to induce him to ratify the Treaty of Mohammerah of the 5th May, 1922, regulating frontier and other questions between Iraq and Nejd. The particular point involved was the boundaries of Qatar. Sir Percy had had no intention of entering upon a discussion of these boundaries, but he discovered that Ibn Saud proposed to grant to a body called the Eastern and General Syndicate a concession over an area including the whole of the Hasa Province of Nejd and the Qatar peninsula. The south-western and southern boundaries of this area were (according to a map produced at the meeting) to be a line drawn down the Wadi Faruk as far as Djau Dukhan (about latitude 24 c North by longitude 49° East and not to be confused with Jebel Dukhan in the Qatar peninsula) and from there eastward to (') The legal aspects of this question, and the policy of His Majesty’s Government in regard to it, are discussed in a separate memorandum entitled “Ibn Sand’s Claims in respect of the South-Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia. ’ E 2203/2203/25 ; June 30, 1940; Confidential Eumber 15997.

Subsequently a reply to this effect couched in the least provocative terms P°. Shl ’ ® was sent to the United States Embassy at Angora. It was considered advisable to inform the Saudi Arabian Government of the American enquiries, and a note addressed by His Majesty’s Legation in Jedda to the Saudi Arabian Gove rumen on the 28th April, 1934, gave the substance of His Majesty s Government s reply. 6 The United States Government apparently accepted the explanation an nothing further has been heard from them on the subject. But Ibn Saud refused with some warmth, to accept the frontier laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Conventions as legally valid on the ground that the Ottoman Government had no right to dispose of his ancestral homeland. His reply was contained m a no _ dated the 13th May, 1934, from the Saudi Arabian Government, In this note they refused to admit that the 1913-14 Conventions had any relevance ou* expressed willingness to discuss the question further. A restatement oi he British thesis in a note of the 15th June elicited a more reasoned statement ot the Saudi case in a note of the 20th June, in which it was argued that the Ottoma Government could have had no locus standi in the matter after Ibn haua occupation of Hasa on the 13th April, 1913. The Saudi Arabian Government further invoked the first Anglo-Saudi Treaty of the 29th December 1915, by which His Majesty’s Government had undertaken to recognize Ibn banas sovereignty over the dominions of his ancestors, and intimated that they na E. 3167/279/ 91 (1934).

The proposed boundary would run from this point of intersection in a south-westerly direction to a point, to be agreed later, on the Violet line. (The new line involved in this offer came to be called the “Green line.”) (iii) II this offer failed to satisfy Ibn Saud, to propose the creation of a “desert zone” lying roughly between meridians 51° and 55 ° East, its northern and southern boundaries being drawn so as to leave a wide margin of territory in the hinterland to the Sheikhdoms of Qatar and Abu Dhabi (on the Trucial Coast) and the Aden Protectorate. This zone was to be subject for a fixed period of years to a special regime, under which neither Ibn Saud nor any other ruler would exercise any rights of territorial sovereignty (such as granting con cessions); but Ibn Saud would retain personal sovereignty over any of his tribes sojourning there. (iv) In that last resort, Ibn Saud might be granted the western part of the desert zone (i.e., west of meridian 52 c East) in full sovereignty.

According to the information m the possession of His Majesty’s Government many of the tribes were of uncertain and changing allegiance. “There were, of course, certain areas which were predominantly or exclusively frequented by certain tribes owing a definite and exclusive allegiance to a particular ruler. His Majesty’s Government were prepared to take such considerations into full account in arriving at a settlement, and indeed had already done so in the formulation of their present proposals. But it seemed clear “that a settlement could not be based on tribal considerations alone and that there existed other factors which should also be taken into account, 15. The discussions with Fuad Bey were necessarily inconclusive and productive of scant tangible result, beyond providing each side with a clearer knowledge of the basis of the other’s claims. It soon became apparent that the greatest difficulties were presented by the northern sector of the frontier. Although Fuad Bey on one occasion indicated, in reply to a question, that Ibn Saud might perhaps be prepared to concede the Jehel Nakhsh, if he was assured of obtaining the Khor-el-Odeid in return, he held out no real hope that the King would be willing to abandon his claim to either of these places, and it seemed likely that the resulting deadlock would render it impossible to reach a settle ment of any other parts of the frontier. It was agreed, however, that both sides should consider the arguments advanced by the other with regard to the northern sector. As regards the southern sector, it appeared from a statement made to Sir A. Ryan by Fuad Bey that Ibn Saud claimed, and based his territorial demands upon, the allegiance of three tribes (the Murra, Beni Hajir, and Dimran [Dimnan]) and part of another (the Manasir) in the Ruba-al-Khali. Before the discussions came to an end Fuad Bey communicated to the Foreign Office a memorandum stating the Saudi view of the position regarding the frontier, together with a statement on the “ diras or tribal areas of the three ) E 4314/77/91 (of July 8, 1935).

Sir A. Ryan was instructed to’emphasis?,o IL® Saud that the present offer represented the utmost limits to which His Maiestv'vj Government were prepared to go and that, indeed, they had only felt abfeto^o thus far on account of their strong desire to reach a final settlement- 'ind further that, while His Majesty’s Government had in no wav abandoned their objections to basing the frontier solely on tribal considerations and were still strongly of the opinion that historical, geographical and strategic considerations must also be taken into account, their present offer in fact covered practical!v the whole “ dira of the Murra tribe (the most important of the three and i half tribes claimed by Ibn Saud), whose allegiance to him His Maiestv’s Governrrw were prepared in principle to recognise. ^ 6 1 20. The boundary thus offered, which is known as the “ Riyadh line ” was defined as follows in a note handed to Fuad Bey at Riyadh on tb» 25th November, 1935, by Sir A. Ryan: ' the (a) A line starting from a point on the eastern shore of the Dohat-as-Salwa 4 miles to the north-east of the point where the sea is nearest to Qasr-as-Salwa and running in a straight line due south-eastwards lor 10 miles (it was decided to indicate the terminal of this line -is key-point A). (b) Thence the boundary would proceed in as straight a line as possible to a point (key-point B) midway between Haluwain and Nakhala, but drawn so as to leave Aqalat-al-Manasir, Farhad, Rimth. Khafur and the route between Doha and Abu Dhabi, which passes west of the Sabkhat-al-Amra, to Abu Dhabi, and Haluwain, Bil Deirish and Raghuwan to Saudi Arabia. (c) From this point (key-point B) the boundary was to proceed in a straight line to the intersection of parallel 23° north with meridian 52° east (key-point C); thence in a straight line to the intersection of parallel 22 30 / north and meridian 55' east (key-point F); and then along that meridian to its intersection with parallel 20° north (key-point G). (d) From there the boundary ran in an approximately straight line, but so as to leave the Sabkhat Mijora in Saudi Arabia and the Ramlat Mugshin in Muscat and Oman, to the intersection of meridian 52° east and parallel 19° north (key-point H) and thence in a straight line to the intersection of parallel 18° north with the Violet line of the Anglo- Turkish Convention of 1914. 21. Sir A. Ryan, when making this offer, informed Fuad Bey that the sections between points G and H were under discussion with the ^ Sultan of Muscat and subject to his confirmation. Fie did, however, hint guardedly to Fuad Bey that, subject to the Sultan’s views, it might be possible for this section of the line to be drawn to include some territory lying to the east of meridian 55°. though not so far east as meridian 56°. 22. This new offer was rejected on the following day, the 26th November, mainly on account of the Saudi Arabian Government’s reluctance to give up the Jebel Nakhsh and Khor-el-Odeid. Fuad Bey, however, more than hinted that, if the Jebel Nakhsh were conceded, Ibn Saud might be induced to abandon his claim to the coastal area which included the Khor-el-Odeid and reduce his demands in the south-east. 23. It was now more than ever evident that the northern sector of the disputed area was the chief obstacle to a general settlement. The claims of Ibn Saud in this area extended to places the cession of which Flis Majesty’s Govern ment considered themselves for various reasons unable to contemplate. The Khor-el-Odeid, the first of these, a small inlet at the south-eastern end of the Qatar penimsula, had for long been recognised as the property of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and the other, the Jebel Nakhsh, a hill at the south-western end of the Qatar peninsula forming part of a larger range of low-lying hills called the Jebel Dukhan, belonged to the Sheikh of Qatar. 24. Ibn Sand’s claim to the Khor-el-Odeid was based partly on the conten tion that in former times his ancestors exercised authoritv over this area, and Enclosure 1 in E. 7574/77/ 91 (1935). Enclosure 2, E. 7475/77/ 91 (1935)., ii • ^ whirh he claimed evidence was given by the partly on local tribal allegian , tribes j n addition, the Saudi Arabian periodical payment of tribute by ^ ^ Khor _ el _ 0dei(i was necessary to- Government mamtamec &lt; J b f rom that area into Saudi Arabia and to them in order P reven t \^ U |g ? 0 8 r a port on the Persian Gulf.

P g , 31. The frontier question was taken up with Fuad Bev later iu the vear Sir' Uc de, re R U n f H° m t vl * lt to Ibn Saud he expressed the following views to ^ Hcadei Bullard, who had by that time succeeded Sir A. Ryan- Vnv impression Sir A. Ryan might have had that the Saudi Arabian Government were prepared to compromise was due to a misunderstanding of his (Fuad Bev’s^ ideas, which were that he should try to find some middle course to recommend to ^mr Governments. He had no counter-proposals to make to the latest offer of ms Majesty s Government, since the southern boundary proposed by the Saudi Arabian Government was based on the essential needs of the tribes in that area, ine British suggestion that the line along longitude 55° East might be moved eastwards was not of much interest to the Saudi Arabian Government, since the country in that region was desert. Fuad Bey appeared to be taking advantage oi the change of Ministers when he suggested that His Majesty’s Government attached the greatest importance to the Khor-el-Odeid, but much less to the Jebel Nakhsh, which the Saudi Arabian Government regarded as most important. Hir R. Bullard held out no hope of any concession beyond that already mentioned, and could only promise to report to the Foreign Office. 32. Sir R. Bullard informed the Foreign Office that but for the complica tion introduced by the interests of Petroleum Concessions, Limited, in Qatar he [22284—1] c -i j10 » u • fovnnr of leaving the question of the eastern and south-eastern would have been in fa'o ^ things were, he could only suggest— frontiers in abeyam^, ’ • f &lt;j in or( j er that the Saudi Arabian (1) that Fuad Bey shou ler no illusion on this point, that His Government mi^h^remain una^ ^ Jebe) N h d th M; l . |Cst fna , s essential but should be asked on what other parte A°^fmnt er he thought that he and His Majesty’s Minister could propoLls likely to appeal to their respective Governments; considered whether His Majesty’s Govern- (2) tha ^“f 'Afford to offer further slight concessions on the borders of Muscat and the ^° of the jifpculties inherent in this second He added that he was wel ^ concessions in those areas would induce suggestion and that “f t he Jebel Nakhsh, but that he saw no other alternative'to the policy of doing nothing, which was ruled out by the aims of Petroleum Concessions, Limite .

So far as the Saudi Arabian Government were ™^ a f®X?ded bv development in the south-eastern f rontier question during 193i was P ' f the discussions which took place in the course of the visit made by M^ Rendeb the head of the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office, to Saudi Ai abia cmr g the early months of the year. „ Ontir 36. ' Mr. Rendel, on his way to Jedda by way o! Bahrein, ™sit j- peninsula with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in a R °val Air F aeroplane. He made a sketch map of the whole Jebel Dukhan, of which ^e J Nakhsh was found to be clearly an integral part and on hls , ar ' l '’ 1 al . a m ®l t.n Sir R. Bullard and he, in the course of prolonged discussions S u- in Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, the Saudi Arabian Minister m London. Mr. Rendel described the terrain fully, but although he dvvelt i fact that the Jebel Nakhsh formed an integral part of the Jebel Dukhan, ana u Jebel Dukhan of the Qatar peninsula, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin reteeiate argument based on tribes; that all the tribes in that area owed t eir a ck , , d Ibn Saud, who might, he added, have put forward far wider claims than{icUially done, but that Ibn Saud, if the Jebel Nakhsh were cdvpn ^ abandon the rest of his claim in that quarter. Mr Kendel said fhat wou ^ of the pemnsula must be maintained, and urged tliaUn view of the claim to the Jebel Nakhsh had been put forward by the Saudi Arabian r * the ment at an advanced stage and had come as a complete surprise toHis Mh Government it was not worth imperill.ng a settlement of L whole y 8 i s account When the discussion turned to the Khor-el-Odeid Air LIZ tha he had hoped something might be done to meet Ibn Sand's wishes l m ?w prolonged and careful study of the records showed that for oveT sivtv vi* long before Ibn Saud had advanced his claim to the territory—Tt WlV V been recognised by His Majesty’s Government as part of Abu Uhabf An'? embodying the most important extracts from documents connected with T history of the Abu Dhabi claim was handed to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin h Z'. io “. e a'gument, employed by the Saudi representatives that the recognition of the special treaty relations of His Majesty's Government whh h! I rucial Sheikhs (see paragraph 17) did not imply the recognition o particular frontiers Mr. Rendel replied that His &gt; Majesty’s Government'! recognition of a valid claim by any Sheikh to any particular jdace fc imed nm- of their treaty relations with that particular Sheikh, and must in ts turn he regarded as covered by Ibn Sand’s recognition of their special relations w.th the^ Sheikhs. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the Khor-el-Odeid itself was without vahm ff ^ S , mCe lt Was , useiess as a harbour, while the land to the west of t Horded the only passage between Abu Dhabi and Qatar. In anv case d w-k impossible lor His Majesty s Government to go back on their undertaking of 38 Finally, the conversation turned to a locality called the Safaq wells which lie on the caravan route from the Trucial coast to Qatar and Hasa at S longitude 52 kast, and Mr Rendel indicated that there was some hope that a concession might be made m that quarter. If, as he believed, the wells were much nearer the coast than appeared from the published maps, the Saudi frontier could be mmed further towards the coast, on condition that Safaq itself and the caravan route remained in Abu Dhabi. But he could not admit the Saudi argument that Safaq was a Murra well. p iv- 9 ' i u D P° ml •° f a few / da 1 &gt;: s later information was received from the Political Resident m the Persian Gulf, based on investigations made by the Royal Air force, that Safaq was as much as three times nearer the coast than apueared on even the latest maps. 40. Mr Rendel made a personal appeal to Ibn Saud for a settlement of the question at his third interview with him on the 21st March, 1937, and urged e mimi that, as His Majesty s Government had made great concessions, Ibn Saud might 26 a^?). make some concession m this quarter; to which Ibn Saud repeated the loL- ^tanding argument that the whole of the coast had belonged to his ancestors and -hat the present rulers could not deny it. There was a limit beyond which he would not go. The boundary of Qatar was well known to be Araik, but unfortunate y this place did not appear on the accessible maps. Sir R. Bullard interposed that he believed it to lie south of the Jebel Nakhsh, and that, if this TnVV gL 1 * 6 ^ 0U \ d n ? ]on g er he an y difference of opinion. As regards the Khor- ef-Udeid Ibn Saud advanced the argument that in claiming it for Saudi Arabia he had the interests of His Majesty s Government as much at heart as his own since no one, lie alleged, but himself could maintain order there and when crimes it, Yusuf a •i - ’ ' • 'a — ™— i wa © negation at Jedda, Araik was situated between Qasr-as-Salwa and the Jehel Nakhsh and enqmrmg whether Ibn Sand’s definition did not on this basis leave the Jebel JNakhsh to Qatar Ibn Sand’s reply, as transmitted by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, was to the eftect that he was not referring to the “ Araik of Nakhsh,” but to the one lying south of Dukhan/' and that therefore the Jebel Nakhsh lay within ^audi Arabia, and that, anyhow, his statement was incidental and did not concern p ]e details of the case. At the same time Sheikh Yusuf Yasin sent a protest trom Ibn Saud against the policy of encirclement which he claimed His Majesty’s Government wwe pursuing against him (a reference to His Majesty’s Govern ment s policy towards the Arab Sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf). 42. In reporting*on these discussions. Sir R. Bullard urged that it was e 1706 / 258 / uudesirable at that moment to endeavour to force a settlement. ‘ If, at the time 9i&lt;i9m of Mr. RendeTs visit, it had been possible to arrange for a settlement of the E 2124/268/ [22284—1] r 2 91(1937) '12 2124/258/ 91(1937) 2124/268/ 91 (1937). whole Question it would have been most desirable, but the frontier question was rvidenSv a ruse of annoyance to Ibn Sand and ,n these circumstances and on “ .f the difference of opinion about the purely geographical aspects of the Je^ Nakhsharea. to press the British claim in that quarter would be to endanger jeoei ivaiuisu ■ , r . ff . f t | ie Rendel conversations. In view' of His Mai«tvTGover,m.ent r s declarations on this subject, Ibn Sand might well feel 1 a he could not hope to obtain either of the two areas which he coveted, hut that o w the same thin® as signing them awav. As regards the dangers arising 'an td^rnTnel fronler, W Majesty’s Minister believed that, in the event of war if Ibn Saud were hostile to His Majesty s Government a purely mner frontier would not deter him from aggressive action, while if he were IXr an ally or a neutral, he would be unlikely to disturb the quo. Su K Bullard urged therefore that, in order not to let the frontier claims go by defnnlt a special joint commission should be sent to examine the purely Graphical features of the Jebel Nakhsh area. At the same time he urged that His Majesty's Government should consider giving Ibn Saud a royalty on any oil whici might be found in or near the Jebel Nakhsh, on the pretext that the oil-bearing strata must run partly under his territory (though a similar plan had been found impracticable w-hen Iraq had endeavoured to buv off lurkish intransigence about Mosul). Finally, he pointed out the strain that would be placed on Ibn Saud if the search for oil and minerals m Saudi Arabia continued to be unsuccessful, while oil were found, as in the case of Bahrein, in the territory of some completely unimportant ruler like the Sheikh of Qatar. 43 On the 7th May, 1937, the Foreign Office replied that, while the undesirability of pressing Ibn Saud for a decision was appreciated, an undeter mined frontier must, in 'their opinion, constitute a continual source of danger and uncertainty, particularly since Petroleum Development (Qatar), Limited (a subsidiary of Petroleum Concessions, Limited, to whom the Anglo-Iraman Oil Company had transferred their Qatar rights on the 5th February, 1937), were hopin 0, to bee in prospecting in the south-western area of the Qatar peninsula. If nothin 0 ' were done to effect at least a crystallization oi tne tiontu i on lines which appeared reasonable to His Majesty’s Government, and therefore to fulfil their obligations to the Arab States on the Trucial Coast, it was always possible that Ibn Saud would continue to pursue his former tactics and seek to extend his influence, thereby rendering the possibility of effecting a territorial settlement increasingly remote, particularly if Anglo-Saudi relations deteriorated as a result of the imminent publication of the Report of the Royal Commission on Palestine. In the circumstances His Majesty’s Minister was asked whether he advocated a unilateral declaration by His Majesty’s Government, to be treated, if necessary, as confidential, defining the line which they regarded as the boundary. It was suggested that this might be done in an amicably phrased note explaining that, though His Majesty’s Government appreciated the reasons for Ibn Sand’s unwillingness to commit himself at this juncture, it was impossible for Hi; Majesty’s Government to allow the question to continue in its present indeter minate'state. It was intended that the note, after defining the northern sector of the frontier on the lines of the Riyadh proposals, modified to take account of the newly defined position of Safaq, should explain that His Majesty’s Govern ment did not intend to claim territory either for themselves or for the Arab Sheikhs in the Persian Gulf beyond that line; they proposed to treat the territory on the Qatar and Abu Dhabi side of the line as either under the control of His Majesty’s Government or the suzerainty of the Arab rulers concerned; finally, while His Majesty’s Government desired to record their position in this question to avoid misunderstanding, they would, in order to spare Ibn Saud any possible embarrassment, refrain from pressing for publication. 44.

Bullard’s reply was that the possibility of an early commence ment of oil prospecting might soon justify the proposed communication, but suggested that, in order to sugar the pill, it was important first to return the most favourable reply possible to a recent request of Ibn Sand’s for arms (reminding him of the arms supplied at a critical moment in 1929 and saying either that His Majesty’s Government did not propose to press at present for payment for the arms supplied then, or else, better still, that they proposed to overlook the question of eventual payment), and then to send a sympathetic note about Ibn Sand’s complaints of His Majesty’s Government’s policy of “ encircle ment,’ in which an offer should be made to show any Saudi representative whom His Majesty might care to appoint that the Jebel Nakhsh formed part of the Jebel Dukhan13 (n 6) cfTT 45 The subject was considered in London at the end of June 1937 e woiok*, as a result His Majesty’s Minister was informed that it was not proposed to 9 /( 193 ?) pursue the suggestion of a unilateral declaration by His Majesty’s Government R 39 ^/ 258 / at least until the oil companies had decided to start prospecting and exploitation 91 (1937) - areas - . The Foreign Office was, however, inclined to favour bir it. Bullard s suggestion of a communication to Ibn Baud on the subiect of a survey of the disputed area, which might taFe the form of a rough topographical enquiry into the geographical features of the area followed by the submission of a report, though it was envisaged that it would be necessary to insist on the inclusion of a representative of the Sheikh of Qatar in the survey party Sir K. Bullard was authorised to speak to Ibn Baud or else to postpone the question till later, when it might be possible to put forward more detailed proposals. In virtue of these discretionary powers Sir R. Bullard, who was about to depart for Riyadh when the telegram arrived, decided to leave the matter until later, partly because all that he and, as it happened, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf had had in mind was quite a short visit to the area in question in order that the Saudi representative might, with the evidence of his own eyes, see that the British contentions were correct and that the TpHpI Nakhsh did, in fact, form part of the Jebel Dukhan. bei 46. Meanwhile, the Government of Aden w^ere asked by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to consider whether some additional concession might not be made in the area between parallels 17° and 18°, particularly to the west of meridian 51°. The Secretary of State considered it desirable'to examine the question from the point of view of the limits of the area over which Aden tribes had indubitable claims, rather than with the intention of excluding Ibn Baud from those districts of which the ownership was completely indeterminate. The Aden Government—although they expressed the hope that a smaller concession would be made—considered that the utmost concession which could be considered politically wise would be the cession to Saudi Arabia of an additional strip of territory by redrawing the frontier from the intersection of the Violet line wdth meridian 48 r to a point on meridian 52°, 20 miles south of parallel 19°. This proposal received the concurrence of the Colonial Office, but His Majesty’s Minister was of the opinion that a strip of desert 20 miles wide by 300 long would not possess much value as a counter in the game, since Ibn Saud apparently attached no great importance to that part of the frontier at that moment. Sir R, Bullard further believed that, in view of the opinion expressed by the Governor of Aden, His Majesty’s Government should try to avoid making the suggested sacrifice, although, if a unilateral declaration were to be made with regard to the frontier of Qatar, he thought they should be prepared to leave to Ibn Saud the whole of the strip in question. On the 1st July the Foreign Office telegraphed to Jedda that the view of His Majesty’s Government was that the balance of advantage lay in leaving the question of the southern section in abeyance for the present time. In conveying this decision to the Governor of Aden, the Colonial Office pointed out that the present policy of establishing British authority more firmly in the interior of the Protectorate would, by facilitating the acquisition of more detailed knowledge on the region, strengthen His Majesty’s Government’s position for a subsequent statement of their claim to that area. 47. The Saudi Arabian-Muscat frontier, though it also was reviewed during the year 1937, was not discussed in Jedda, but formed the subject of cohsiderable E correspondence between the Political Agent at Muscat and the Sultan. The Sultan showed himself reluctant to define the western limits of his territory. It had never been done before. The possibility that there had been talk of oil concessions had—it was believed—made the Sultan even more suspicious than would have been expected. However, in a letter addressed to the Political Agent on the 11th May, 1937, the Sultan finally stated that he would raise no objection if the eastern limits of the territory belonging to Ibn Saud were defined by a line based on the following points (see those selected for the definition of the “ Riyadh ” line, paragraph 20):— C. The intersection of 52° E. and 23° D. The intersection of 54° 40' E. and 22 r 40' N. E. The intersection of 55° 40' E. and 22 N. G. The intersection of 55° E. and 20° N. H.

On the 29th November, further instructions were sent to Jedda. which formed the basis of a note delivered by His Majesty’s Legation to the Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs. The most important passage of this note was as follows . “ I have the honour to inform Your Royal Highness that, accoiding to recent reports which have reached His Majesty's Government, it appears that the Standard Oil Company of California are prospecting m the neigh bourhood of Qasr-al-Salwa. The views of His Majesty s Government ^ith regard to the frontier in the said area have already been communicated to Ilfs Majesty King Abdul Aziz, and His Majesty’s Government are prepared to reopen negotiations for a settlement on the lines they have indicated. They assume that in the meantime no attempt will be made by the Californian Arabian Company to pass the line defined m the latest proposals by His Majesty’s Government to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, so long as no final agreement has been reached as to that line. Since, however, there is some uncertainty as to the precise position of certain physical features concerned, His Majesty’s Government propose, that a joint Anglo-baudi topographical mission should be appointed to establish on the spot the exa( nature and position of these features.' To avoid all misunderstanding, the British definition of the frontier made by Sir Andrew Ryan at Riyadh was repeated with the necessary modification in regard to the position of Safaq. As soon as the note had been handed to the Saudi Arabian Government, Sir R. Bullard informed the Foreign Office by telegram in order that they might explain the position informally to the London representative of the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company, while he himself made a similar communication to the Jedda representative of the company. . o* o 51. Subsequently both Fuad Bey and Sheikh Yusuf \asin gave Sir K. Bullard highly coloured accounts of Ibn Saud s displeasure at the reception ot this note, which he thought typical, they said, of His Majesty s Government s disposition to give assurances of friendship, but never to make any concession on any material issue. Sheikh Yusuf even reported that Ibn Saud was asking whether the British intended to treat him as the Italians were treating Spain, or the Japanese China. It had not been expected that the note would be well received, but, since the decision had been taken and could not be reversed, nothing remained except to produce evidence to show that His Majesty’s Government15 hud in fact been helpful over many m a n„ ' aU the Standard Oil Company of !‘ ment had informed the Cnbf^’ uafl Bov Ssrai 2 rrs«.*» •*-% zrs&amp;ss*, ~ p s Majesty’s Government nf »li Was und ^ dispute , com P ai 'Y .0 order to demarcate He], erect m“ l8 ”oI',‘ M Sataf assurance, he added that he hoped ft wouM fo^ 6 ' S ' r R Bullard repcte. piospectmg in that area, and stated ft P resent poassible to nns favoured an agreement according to places and n** ‘ Arabiari Government themselves acquainted, rather than one deDenl^ lnClpleS witb which they geographical features TTa k^i , ae P en dent on an examin**;^ ^ l 7656/268/ 91 (1937). i , rather than one denmnW P es Wltb wbicb they were geographical features.

As a result of this decision and in an endeavour to meet the Saudi noint of view as stated in (1) of paragraph 51, it was decided to ascertain whetheT he Petroleum Concessions, Limited, would, in fact, 1 * willing to help His Majesty's Government in this matter.

Majesty s Government to grant full approval to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Gompany concession secured in May 1935 from the Sheikh of Qatar was com municated privately and confidentially to Lord Cadman. It was explained that at that time nothing was known of Ibn Sand’s claims, and the possibility that he would ever seriously lay claim to territory as far east of the Blue line as the ^ehel Nakhsh seemed so remote as to he almost negligible. The concession was therefore approved by His Majesty’s Government without misgiving. Its terms were never communicated to the Saudi Arabian Government, although they protested against its conclusion at the time, and from later indications it 5 I! e c •——.. {'16 u nnHpr the impression that it did not include appeared that they may which may have arisen as the result of a the Jebel Nakhsh— a rmsund ® ag &gt;? n b His Majesty’s Charge d Affaires at letter addressed to k t tp j “ the concession does not extend to Jedda in September 1935 , wh ch taW that^ „ (gee paragra p hs lS any territory under discussion _ po j nte d out in the note that the political above and 59 below).

As stated in paragraph 50, the Jedda representative of the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company, Mr. Lenahan. had been informed of the proposal to appoint a joint Anglo-Saudi frontier commission by His Majesty s Minister, and warned of the line beyond which His Majesty s Government considered no company holding a Saudi concession had a right to go. in a subsequent conversation with Fuad Bey, Mr. Lenahan most indiscreetly alluded to this information, whereupon the Saudi Arabian Government on the . „ , 1 Vi XT’. A r T .-,iTo f j/'vrv arvoinct nrimm nn 1 P.fl t.l OTIS sentatives of the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company m a manner wmcn they pointed out, might be interpreted as implying the existence ot doubts and suspicions about the attitude of Ibn Saud. The oil companies, their note addeu, acted in accordance with instructions which were issued to them by the Governments in control of the territories in which they worked, and the question of the frontiers of these territories could only be discussed between Governments, and not between private companies. Fuad Bey supplemented this note by informing Sir R. Bullard that the communication to Mr. Lenahan had been taken as a personal affront by Ibn Saud, as implying that he might endeavour to do sometning underhand which it required pressure on the company from His Majesty’s Government to prevent. This last misconception Sir R. Buliard was able to remove with obvious arguments. 59. The second incident was of a more serious character.

It was, therefore, with the intention of preventing an endless exchange of tu arguments and in view of the proposed modification of policy with rn g V 1( IV K 1 hor - el -° ( l ieidi that earl y in March 1938 Sir R. Bullard appealed uad Bey, who was about to go on leave, to make some attempt to get out of the impasse, and suggested that Fuad Bey should give his personal opinion as to the nature of the solution which he thought might conceivably prove acceptable to the Saudi Arabian Government, promising that he himself would ponder the matter and give his personal views on the possibility of its acceptance by His Majesty s Government. In this way neither Government would be irrevocably committed, and a solution might be found. Fuad Bey, after a delay of several days ostensibly for ‘ 1 reflection,’' during which he had doubtless ascertained Ion baud s reactions to the proposal, advanced a suggestion in which he first all but insisted on the retention of the Jebel Nakhsh, but finally proposed, as a plan which might have some hope of acceptance by Ibn Saud, that His Majesty’s Government should offer to abandon to Ibn Saud whichever of the two areas, the Jebel Nakhsh and Khor-el-Odeid, they considered the less important, and that the line demarcating the frontier should pass through the Safaq wells in such a way as to make them free of access to the population on both sides of ths frontier. 63. These proposals not only provided a satisfactory answer to Sir R. Bullard's enquiry, but seemed to he compatible with the proposed modification of policy with regard to Khor-el-Odeid. Sir R. Bullard, however, [22284— 1] ' d18 „ ave ru ad Bev no hint that he thought a compromise on these lines possible. ?? „;n iw anv reolv he gave would be purely personal and that he proposed temporary successor at the Ministry on leave in Syria. _ he was of opinion IV'l 'promise on these''lines was possible and that it offered the possibility of removing the sole major obstacle in Anglo-Saudi relations, other than Palestine.^ ^ jggg a written reply to the protest of the 20th January about communications between His Majesty’s Minister and local oil representatives was communicated to the Saudi Arabian Government, stating that m 1934, when the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company were beginning their operations in Hasa, the United States Government had asked His Majesty s Government for information about boundaries in those regions, and that His Majesty’s Government had not onlv furnished the information but explained carefully and confidentially that the legal frontier in that area was the Blue line. The Saudi Arabian Government were duly informed at the time of this communication to the United States Government, and since that time His Majesty’s Government had not informed either the Saudi Arabian Government or the United States Government that they no longer consider the Blue line as the legal frontier, or that they considered that the company was free to prospect to the east of that line. His Majesty’s Government felt that they would have been justified in making a protest to the Saudi Arabian Government when they learned that the company, in spite of the information conveyed to that Government, were operating near Qasr-al-Salwa; but on the contrary, purely out of deference to Ibn Saud and from their desire to facilitate matters for him and for the company, they had merely informed the company’s representatives quite informally that they would raise no objection to the company’s operating, within certain limits, to the east of the extreme limit yet proposed by Plis Majesty’s Government to the Saudi Government, and this notwithstanding the previous communication made to the United States Government and to the Saudi Arabian Government. His Majesty’s Government had acted in accordance with this practice in cases where important oil companies, whether of the same or of different nationalities, were operating in adjoining areas, and they regretted that the Saudi Arabian Government should take exception to a normal procedure designed to ensure the maintenance of good relations between the great oil companies and the countries in which they were registered. 65. In November 1938, when His Majesty’s Minister was at Riyadh, Fuad Bey interrogated him about the frontier question, and, emphasising the importance that attached to the question in Ibn Saud’s eyes, asked whether Sir R. Bullard was able to make some reply to the proposals which he had put forward in the spring. But as His Majesty’s Government had not been able to reach any agreement about the proposed cession of the Khor-el-Odeid owing to the existing rights of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, which it was suggested could not he disregarded even if the sheikh were offered compensation in other directions, ^ir R. Bullard was not, in the circumstances, able to give an encouraging reply to this question. 66. Since Fuad Bey s conversation with Sir R. Bullard in November 1938 the Saudi Arabian Government have not raised the question again, and it may apparently be considered to be in abeyance. No mention of it was made in Ibn Saud s 'etter to the Prime Minister which the F.mir Feisal brought with him v&gt;hen he came to London tor the Palestine Conferences early in 1939, nor did the Finn himself mention the dilTerences of opinion between His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Saudi Arabian Government on this question in the course of interviews with the Secretary of State and Sir L. Oliphant.

Tv by ii r . T ' Fowlc - the Poetical fern l i iwc i v L hl f des P atch No - 594-S of the 28th June 1934 to the India Office, which shows that Ibn Saud has no valid “ ancestral ' claims to • nv part of Qatar arid the Pmcial Coast, although the important oasis of Baraimi in the h interland of ihe Trucial Coast, is a doubtful point. As Sir f Fowle then pointed out the complexities of Arabian history and of tribal moveme7s make it impossible to refute in detail every vague ancestral claim which may be put forward by the Saudi Arabian Government, but it seems to be satisfactonJv established that no such claim deserves serious consideration. ' ^ 12, * *'*! j r i*&gt;al claims, however, need to be examined more closely since they are really the basis of the whole Saud, case. Briefly, the view put forward by the Saudi Arabian Government is that, since much of the territory adjoining he eisian 3ulf to the east of the Blue line is under no regular rule, the status of any part of that territory must be determined solely on the basis of tribal allegiances. This view has not been accepted unreservedly by His Maiestv's Government who have pointed out on more than one occasion (e.g., at the meeting iTi om w Bey ,?Q* m « T 2 t th Julle ’ 1935; see Eastern (Arabia) Print of the 25th June, 193.,, Section 3) that, since many Arabian tribes are accustomed to wander over a very wide area, it would be impossible to base territorial claims on the extent of those wanderings, or to establish a frontier line solely in accordance with fluctuating tribal allegiances; and further that a simple allo cation of tribal areas could not, as the Saudi Arabian Government are sometimes inclined to maintain replace a territorial frontier. Subject to these reservations however, it follows from what has already been said earlier in this memorandum that, it is justifiable for the Saudi Arabian Government to contend that where a given area is inhabited by tribes the majority of which acknowledge their allegiance to Ibn Saud, and no other ruler has any effective claim to that territory it may rightfully be claimed by the Saudi Arabian Government, 13 Moreover, it seems justifiable to contend, as the Saudi Arabian Govern ment do, that in the absence of other indications the payment of “ zakat ” (a form of tribute or tax) may be regarded as the factor determining the allegiance ot a particular tribe. Ihe question to what extent it is admissible to invoke the payment ot tribute as evidence of sovereignty has already formed the subject of ioo, aUS . tlV % d \ SCUS f 10n - . Illhis demi-official letter No. C/lol of the 30th March, * u -i g lr . ^ ow *e maintained, with regard to payments made by certain Aral) s ei hs, including the Sheikh of Qatar, to Ibn Saud, that these payments could in no way be regarded as formal tribute, or as constituting a recognition of ibi) Sand as the overlord of the payers. The observations of Sir T. Fowle referred however only to payments made to Ibn Saud by the Sheikhs of Qatar and the 1 racial States, whose independence of Saudi Arabia was in any case safeguarded by tffie special engagements existing between them and His Majesty’s Government winch were recognised by the Saudi Arabian Government under article 6 of the treaty of Jedda, Clearly there could be no question of these payments having involved in any way a recognition of Ibn Sand’s overlordship. 14. In the case of “ zakat ” payments made by local tribal chiefs inhabiting territory to which no one has a legal claim and over which no ruler exercises anv eftective authority, the position is, however, somewhat different, since the status oi those chiefs is nowhere established by treaty and may therefore be taken to depend on the degree of allegiance given by them to one or other of the recognised local rulers. Thus there would seem to be some force in the argument that in such cases the levy of “ zakat,” whether it is called “ blackmail ” or by some other name, may be regarded as taxation and consequently as providing evidence of 122284—2 ] ° B 2 V 47H4/279/ 91 (1934) 5. 3944/77/ 91 (1935). . 2332/279/ 91 (1934)4 E. 4734/279/ 91 (1934) E. 5858/2429/ 25 (1934) E. 2124/258/ 91 (1934).

T-.' To sum up therefore, it may be said that those territories to the east and iuth of 'the Blue and Violet lines of the 1914 Convention which are under no clearly defined sovereignty and to which no local Arab ruler has a valid claim, either through the exercise of effective control over the area in question or on the basis of formal engagements with His Majesty's Government already existing in 1927 ind recognising his authority over that area, are territories to which the Solid? Arabian Government are legally entitled to put forward a claim and that in s ch cases the payment of tribute may, m the absence of other indications, properly he adduced as evidence of sovereignty. Having established this principle in iudgmg the Saudi case, it seems appropriate to consider briefly the mam claims WWto nut forward by the Saudi Arabian Government, i.e., their claims to the territory ^.d^oining 1 the'Khor-el Odeid, an inlet of the Persian Gulf to the south- east of the Qatar peninsula, and to the Jebel Nakhsh, a mountain area to the south-west of the Qatar peninsula, claims to which the present deadlock m the frontier negotiations is mainly attributable, as well as the claims advanced by them in regard to the other sections ot the fiontier. (B)- -The Saudi Claim to the Khor-el-Odeid. 16. This is based (a) on historical arguments, and (h) on tribal allegiances^ 17 An effective refutation of (a) was contained m the note given to bheikii Yusuf Yasin by Mr. Ren del after the conversation recorded in the enclosure to Jedda despatch No. 47 of the 20th March, 1937 (Eastern (Arabia) 1 rint of the 19th April, 1937, Section 1). As stated already, the historical arguments put forward by the Saudi Arabian Government have not much force. 18. As regards (6), the Saudi Arabian Government claim that the tribes of the Khor-el-Odeid owe allegiance to Ibn Sand. This contention's supported bv some of the available information, e.g., the statement made to Mr I. lowle in 1934 by the Sheikh of Qatar to the effect that “ a neutral zone between Qatar and Abu Dhabi extended along the coast and some miles inland from Khoi Odeid to Sabkhat Matti, hut that this zone was not recognised by Tbn baud, who took the revenue from it because he was strong enough to do so (see bn . Fowle’s telegram No. T/98 of the 6th April, 1934. paragraph 3 (c)) The alleged existence of a “ neutral zone ” is also mentioned m paragraph 2 of the enclosure to the letter No. C. 17 of the 18th January, 1934, from the Political Agent Koweit, to Sir T. Fowle. As against this, however, Bahrein confidential despatcn No C /965-1.a/38 of the 12th December, 1934, and its enclosure suggest on the strength of assertions by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and his family, that Ihn baud has no claim to any part of the coast between Qatar and the Musandam peninsu a, which belongs to one or other of the 1 rucial Sheikhs. , T ri ^ a 19. The practical justification for Ibn Sand’s claim to the Khor-el-Odeia is thus at best doubtful. But whatever foundation it might otherwise have had is weakened by the evidence which can be derived from the attitude ot -tii^ Majesty’s Government in the past. Thus in 1878 Sheikh Zaid of Abu Dhabi was assisted in sending an expedition to exterminate the pirates of Odeid. ine pirates fled before the expedition arrived, but it was made clear that Per Majestv’s Government regarded the Sheikh of Ahu Dhabi as responsible ten jk happened at Odeid and recognised that place as his territory. Later m Sheikh Yasin-bin-Thani of Qatar was told, in reply to his enquiries, that lie Majesty’s Government could not agree to his rebuilding Odeid, as the place is an appanage of Abu Dhabi.” Again, in 1891, when the Ottoman Government tried to send a mudir to Odeid, diplomatic representations were immediate y made on the ground that Odeid belonged to Abu Dhabi, and the Ottoman Govern ment abandoned their project in consequence.E 1512/279/ 91 (1934). 1513/81/ 91 (1934). i. /cap naraeraDhs 6 and 7 and section IV of the Appendix in the Qatar peninsu &lt; (^ I n ^ an d paragraph 10 of Colonel in India Office memorandum » 4^ ^ p^ itioal Resident); Dickson’s letter^o. o ^ 1923 discussions it is doubtful whether but in view of the foment .

The foregoing paragraphs show that the country adjoining the Khor- el-Odeid as well as the Jebel Nakhsh are areas inhabited by tribes who may owe allegiance and pay tribute to Tbn Saud, and are, at any rate, probably beyond the effective control of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi or the Sheikh ol Qatar; that in these circumstances Ibn Saud is legally entitled, in spite of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914, to claim them as being under his sovereignty; but that His Majesty’s Government are precluded from admitting this claim by reason of the fact that they have in the past formally acknowledged these areas to be within the territory of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and the Sheikh of Qatar respectively, notwithstanding the absence of any clear ground on which the claims to sovereignty of these Sheikhs could be sustained. 38. the steps which have been taken since 1934 to find a solution of this problem are the subject of a separate memorandum. Eastern Department, June 30, 1940. Appendix. Minute by Mr. W. E. Beckett. WE start from the position that Turkey, by the treaty of 1914. article 3. which adopted article 11 of the treaty of 1913, accepted ihe blue line as the limits of Turkish sovereignty in this part of the Arabian peninsula. From this it is clear that to the extent that Ibn Saud is the successor of the old Ottoman Empire in this part of the world and must base his claim on such succession, the blue line represents the limits of the territories which he acquired as Turkey’s successor. I see that he was disposed to take the view that, even in 1913-14, r l nrkey was not the sovereign in this part of the world, that he was already thenan independent Power, and that Turkey’s treaties were invalid because she was dealing with territories over which she had no sovereignty. This argument is “tXS ft’KSf&amp;JWS' ' h,ch “* s “' 11 „ 1 he fo regoing however, only amounts to this : as successor of Turkey he ^ t lh.cY k bey ° nd Yif b Ue ''u- and he certainl y was the successor of Turkey W Y 110 m f ,1S the same thl L n g as sa y n g tha t Ibn Saud cannot, since that date, have acquired a sovereignty beyond the blue line, or that His Maiestv’s Government possess sovereignty right up to the blue line on the other side or that any sheikh under their protection does so. 3. The subsequent questions for consideration fall substantially into two classes . («) the question whether by our subsequent treaty negotiations with Ibn His Majesty s Government have waived or lost any right that thev may otherwise have possessed to hold Ibn Baud’s territories to be limited by the blue line and (ft) whether, even if a negative answer is returned to (a), it must be admitted that a substantial portion of the territory east of the blue line is res nuUius and therefore as such (i) open to acquisition by occupation on the part ot Ibn baud and (n) not being under the sovereignty of His Maiestv’s Government or within the territory of any sheikhs under their protection is an area where His Majesty s Government have no legal right to object to steps being taken by Ibn baud in the direction of acquisition of sovereignty by occupation, even if he lias not at present done sufficient to acquire a definitive title. 4. It must be remembered that under international law territory is either under the sovereignty of a member of the family of nations, or it is not; if it is nof, then it is open to acquisition by occupation by another Pow^r. Spheres of influence in international law, whatever their political significance, mean nothino- at alt. It a btate admits it has not sovereignty over a territory, but only claims a sphere of influence over it, then apart from treaty obligations binding particular Powers not to enter the sphere of influence, &amp;e., legally any other Power can o 0 there and take steps to make itself sovereign. I am well aware that from the political point of view spheres of influence may have great importance. It may be a ground upon which representations may be made to another State that its action in going there is provocative and unfriendly, and that it must not be surprised if its action provokes the resentment and retaliation which may lollow upon provocative and unfriendly, but nevertheless perfectly legal, acts. Legally a sphere of influence is of no effect at all unless you have a specific treaty with the Power who is entering the zone, under which the latter has specifically undertaken not to do so. 5. The second point to be remembered is that under international law. to use the words of Huber as arbitrator in the Palmas Island award : “ Territorial sovereignty cannot be limited to its negative side.' Sovereignty over territory cannot consist in a mere right to keep other States out when the soi-disant sovereign exercises no authority whatever there. If this is the position, then even if the soi-disant sovereign had originally a perfectly sound title, he will lose it lf ^tate enters the territory and de facto exercises authority there for a sufficient period, and thus acquires a prescriptive right. 6. Applying these principles to the case of the territory immediately to the cast of the blue line, it seems to be perfectly clear that neither His Majesty’s Government nor any Arab State under their protection exercises any authority there The Sheikh of Qatar, in whose name we should like to claim the territory, has apparently never attempted to exercise authority up to the blue line, and may be even completely unaware that we are, as it were, attempting to incorporate it into his principality. Turkey, Ibn Baud’s predecessor, did, it is true, impliedly agree in the 1914 treaty that the territory east of the line belonged to the sheikhdom of Qatar, but I do not think that even against Turkey this treaty would mean that Turkey had undertaken not to cross the line, and acquire sovereignty there by occupation if, in fact, the territory was res nullius, and the Sheikh of Qatar and His Majesty’s Government did nothing to establish themselves there. Still less, I think, could it be said that this treaty had this legal effect as regards Ibn Saud as Turkey’s successor. The facts being what they are, I think it is impossible really to establish that the karea in fact belongecl to the Sheikh of Qatar in 1914, and if this is so, I see no ground upon which His Majesty’s Government could have established any title to it at that time. It was res null ins. The position is clearly weaker to-day because there is certainly some evidencex 10 that Ibn Saud has in fact to some extent established his own authority there. T am not attempting to advise now whether the amount of authority Ibn baud has exercised uS'this date is sufficient to give him a title by occupation or prescnp- uon or whether it is only a state of affairs which will produce this result m time, if his nresent authority there is maintained and increased. 7 P On these grounds I think that the territory immediately east ot the blue line is at present either res nullius or (conceivably) in parts already under the sovereignty oObn barn!f ^ ^ ^ agalDSl His Majesty's Government when they seek to maintain that the blue line represents to-day the limits of Ibn Saud s domirdons (as opposed to those which he could claim as successor to Turkey) m based upon the subsequent agreements and negotiations with him in 1915 1J22 and 1927 It is true, as Sir A. Ryan states, that the agreements of 1915 a 27 appear to proceed upon the basis that Ibn Sand’s territories and those of the Sheikh of Qatar. &amp;c„ are co-terminous, i.e., that there is no vacuum between them, but this seems to me to be an argument which cuts both ways though of course it does dispose of any case bu.lt up on a British sphere of influence as opposed to territory belonging to the dominions of the Sheikh of Qatar. But from the legal point of view, the sphere of influence argument was clearly hopeless m any case and any substantial use of it seems to be merely an admission of weakness on our part and a virtual giving away of any legal case that we may have. It is of course, an argument against His Majesty’s Government that m negotiating the 1915 agreement no mention whatever is made of the blue line. It is not by any means conclusive, because the agreement of 1915 proceeds on the footing that the boundaries of Ibn Saud on one hand and Qatar on the other are all to be delimited by agreement. The most that can be said is that the 191o agreement appears to proceed on the assumption that in the future delimitation b} agice ment the criterion should be the areas over which Ibn Saud and his predecessors and the Sheikh of Qatar, &amp;c., possessed in the past, and this rather suggests that we did not think the blue line agreement with Turkey was necessarily to be relevant. This is, of course, not conclusive, because it may well be that Ibn Saud and his predecessors could not really establish claims on past histoiy to territory crossing the blue line or even coming anywhere near it, and we would not put the blue line into the agreement because we were not then prepared to admit that he could establish a claim that even went as far as this. I doubt vei &gt; much il the 1927 treaty carries the matter any further. The 1922 agreement relates to an area which is so far distant fromThe blue line that it can hardly be said to be directly relevant at all. The most that can be said about it is that the fiontier with Koweit there agreed upon is quite different from that laid down in the treaty with Turkey of 1913 and once again the arrangements with Turkey do not appear to have been taken as the basis for fixing the new frontiers. The argument alone is not, I think, very conclusive, but is, of course, a straw which acquires some force when added to other indications of the same kind. More nearly relevant are the lines drawn by Sir Percy Cox in 1922 at T qair actually in the areas concerned (E. 1512. para. 4 of the India Office memorandum). Sir Percv Cox drew a line indicating what he considered then to be Ibn Saud s limits, which follows quite a different course from the blue line, and this is perhaps a rather strong indication that the 1915 agreement with Ibn Saud did not mean the blue line to be relied upon when the frontier delimitation contem plated by that agreement was taking place. 9 The conclusion to be drawn from all this is that, while we are perfectly justified to use the blue line and the position of Ibn Saud as a successor of Turkey, &amp;c., as much as we can in negotiating with Ibn Saud in order to secure the most acceptable frontier possible in wording future agreements, I dp not think we should win before a tribunal, deciding the matter on legal principles, if the issue was whether the area immediately east of the blue line was a part of the territory of the Sheikh of Qatar, a British-protected principality, or, if it was res nullius, whether Ibn Saud was free to acquire territory by occupation or prescription, if he could produce evidence of the state of affairs necessary to support such a claim.

The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi could also ifasS , P 61 - 1 an assurance that his frontier would be respected, and would probably ev^fol-ih '’Tr dlp ,T at ' C lntei ' v ention, but a guarantee of protection in the ' ' ' thc v,, 'lation of his territory Finally, it was suggested that there were .tiong arguments against allowing Saudi Arabian expansion on the Trucial Uvist, and allowing the line of protected States to be broken. It was maintained that these arguments had lost none of their former validity; that the strategic importance of the area along the Arab coast of the Gulf precluded any weakening of British influence among the minor sheikhs; and that the increase of Ibn Saud’s influence at the expense of His Majesty’s Government, and the impression which might be spread abroad that His Majesty’s Government were in fact afraid of him, would be particularly unfortunate at a moment when the Trucial Sheikhs were in a difficult mood and inclined to flout the wishes of His Maiestv’s Government. J J , . After two months the Foreign Office replied on the 1st July in a letter e 2579 / 150 / which set iorth the point of view as a result of which the offer of cession of the si (1938). a , ( Se ® 8e P arat e memorandum, with maps, entitled “ The South-Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia. E 2203/2203/25 ; June 30, 1940 ; Confidential, No. 15996. 11306- 3 [22284—3] B2 Khor-el-Odeid had been proposed. The European crisis and the manifest deterioration of the situation in Palestine had made it absolutely essentia to do everything possible to retain the goodwill of Ibn Sand and to strengthen him in his dealings with his own subjects, and access to the Persian Gult at a new point would be helpful in both directions. 1 he rights of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi extended in theory to the Blue line( 3 ) of the Anglo-Ottoman Agreements of 1913 d 1914 but His Majesty’s Government had had to recognise that he had not asserted his authority further than the Riyadh Hnef) at the utmost, and that, in so far as he had failed to exercise his rights, they had lapsed automatically to Tbn Sand as the result of a movement which had probably begun before the Blue line was demarcated. Recent enquiries had shown that the control of the hinterland bv the Trucial Sheikhs was not really effective, whereas Saudi officials Ind in fact of recent vears, penetrated as far as Baraimi. It was considered that the only way to check Ibn Saud's advance was a settled frontier Laid down either as a result of a unilateral declaration by His Majesty's Government or as a result of a compromise between Ibn Baud and His Majesty’s Government. From the point of view of His Majesty’s Government, the second alternative was far and away the better. This could only be secured by ceding to Ibn Sand either the Jebel Nakhsh. which was impossible,O or the Khor-el-Odeid. It was suggested that the surrender of this small area of empty desert would be a matter of little consequence to the sheikh, whereas it would please Ibn Baud both on the grounds of prestige and as a possible corridor for an oil pipe-line. If this argument had no force with the sheikh, it was suggested that some compensation would have to be considered either in the form of a money payment or a guarantee that, in the event of aggression, His Majesty’s Government would afford him more than merely diplomatic intervention. Payment of a sum of money was distasteful, in that it brought a questionable element into a settlement which really could be justified on its merits, but, if some such arrangement was essential, His Majesty’s Government ought to be, prepared to pay £25,000, or even more, to secure a settlement. Ihe alternative, an assurance of piotcction, could not be taken to apply to tribal raids from Saudi Arabia, and the undertaking should be so worded that it applied only in the event of a major aggression against Abu Dhabi on the part of the territorial sovereign on the other side of the frontier. The Foreign Office were inclined to think that some such settlement would not materially increase in practice the responsibilities of His Majesty’s Government in that area. Their interests in the air route and in oil must necessarily make it impossible for them to be indifferent to any threat to the territories of the Trucial Sheikhs. The Foreign Office agreed, however, that every effort should be made to avoid giving the additional commitment involved in a definite guarantee of any frontier which might be subsequently demarcated, and to limit our support to a promise of energetic intervention with Ibn Sand or his successors should they disregard the new frontiers. It was suggested that His Majesty’s Government had in this matter a right to insist on their point of view, since in fact the Trucial Sheikhs could not hold out for a day against Ibn Sand without His Majesty’s Government’s protection and support. The danger that might result from a diminution of the prestige of His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf was clearly realised, but the Foreign Office did not share the India Office’s view that this would be the inevitable consequence of the proposed action. “ It might indeed be represented to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi that Ibn Saud is the friend of the English, and has throughout his career (unlike certain lesser Arab rulers of no importance who are ignorant of world affairs) shown himself consistently well disposed to His Majesty’s Government and anxious in all circumstances to consult their interests, so that His Majesty s Government for their part have no hesitation in asking the sheikh to contribute his share towards an agreement which is considered to be advantageous to all parties.’’ As for the objection raised by the Government of India, that there were political reasons against breaking the chain of territories under British control extending from Qatar to Muscat, the Service Departments concerned were understood to be satisfied that no strategic disadvantage would accrue from Saudi access to Khor-el-Odeid. Finally, a fixed frontier would have the effect of setting a limit to Saudi Arabian expansion. (*) (*) See memorandum referred to in footnote (M.

I f His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, whenever oie question was raised on the Saudi Arabian side, showed that their’only wish as to leave the matter in abeyance for an indefinite period, while refusing to admit Ibn Saud’s claims to the Jebel Nakhsh and the Khor-el-Odeid, it would [ 22284—3 J B 24 E 1087/108/ 91 (1939). be difficult to prevent Ibn Sand from feeling resentment at the arbitrary manner in which his claims had been treated, and in the event of an international emergency it would be all the easier for His Majesty’s Government’s enemies to influence Ibn Saud by a promise of full satisfaction of his territorial claims if he abandoned his traditional policy of friendship with Great Britain. The letter concluded with a suggestion that the whole question might be discussed orally between representatives of the Foreign Office and the India Office at an informal meeting. 11. In pursuance of this latter suggestion and as a result of the divergence of opinion on this matter which existed between the India Office and the Foreign Office, a meeting was held on the 2nd February, 1939, between representatives of the Foreign Office and the India Office with a view to finding some method of preventing the negotiations for the settlement of the dispute from reaching a complete deadlock. A suggestion was made by the representative of the Foreign Office that an offer should be made to Ibn Saud to submit the question of the south-eastern boundaries to arbitration, and the representatives of the India Office promised that, if the Foreign Office would state their proposals in writing, the Secretary of State for India would be prepared, in consultation with the Government of India, to consider them. 12. On the Oth April, therefore, an informal letter was sent by the Foreign Office to the India Office setting out ideas for a procedure whereby the question might be prevented from reaching deadlock, and discussing various difficulties regarding the scope and nature of arbitration and the choice of the arbitrator. It was pointed out that, in this question, His Majesty’s Government stood in relation to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in two separate capacities—as the Power which was internationally responsible for his actions, and as the Power which was responsible to him only for the Khor-el-Odeid. The fact that His Majesty’s Government told the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in 1906 that they regarded certain areas as lying in his territory did not constitute proof that that area did lie in his territory, or invalidate any claims which a third party— e.g., Saudi Arabia— might have to it; and if that party put forward these claims, His Majesty’s Government in their capacity as the Power responsible for Abu Dhabi must, even out of merely neighbourly good feeling, take all responsible steps to reach a just settlement without regard to the difficulties in which their actions might involve them in their capacity as guarantor. In the second case, it was suggested that, if His Majesty’s Government could not grant Ibn Saud his request, or even offer him a procedure by which he stood a chance of getting what he asked if he could make out any adequate case without breaking the pledge made to a neighbouring sheikh. His Majesty’s Government would have to find some method of compensating the sheikh in other directions. With regard to the nature of the pledge given in 1906 by His Majesty’s Government to the Sheikh * of Abu Dhabi, it seemed to the Foreign Office to be clearly a pledge on the part of His Majesty’s Government to use their best endeavours to prevent the occupation by any other ruler of the area of undefined extent adjoining the Khor-el-Odeid. But the form of His Majesty’s Government’s endeavours would necessarily vary with the circumstances, and if, as a result of the employment of diplomatic methods, including, it might be, arbitration or mediation, the third party could make a justifiable claim to the area, it did not seem that His Majesty’s Government would remain under an obligation to resist by forcible methods the occupation of the area by the third party; His Majesty’s Govern ment could not do more for their client than they could do for themselves in similar circumstances, and it was suggested that the client similarly could not expect His Majesty’s Government to do more on his behalf than the intrinsic merits of his case permitted. It was also suggested that, if Ibn Saud wished to dispute the legal claim of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and to claim that he was in law the owner of the territory, the 1906 pledge could not possibly mean that His Majesty’s Government were bound to resist Ibn Saud by force and to refuse to submit the legal question to arbitration, which would be the normal course. If His Majesty’s Government did so, it would be quite inconsistent with their continual professions of attachment in principle to pacific settlement of inter national disputes. In conclusion, the Foreign Office asked that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi should be. warned that His Majesty’s Government might find it necessary to agree that the question of the frontier, including the section near Khor-el-Odeid, should be submitted to some form of peaceful settlement, such asarbitration, and that if this should prove to be the case, His Majesty’s Govern- eTentuIZleHT^ hlS c t lalni ' to , the ut n‘ ost of their ability. If sich arbitration Sauri VrahG had ,;^ S ‘ f rta t lnl &gt;’ wouId - wlth a clearly-defined frontier which ihoi ih t b ij u ' ldeltaken 10 aspect, it seemed to His Majesty’s Government thf m0r f t Strongly P to the secunt y of Ws sheikhdom than me pmsent state of affairs. It was, of course, added that if the sheikh &gt;° ?- ny pl ' 0posa] of this nature ’ or asked whether any guarantee by His Majesty s Government of his new frontier would be forth coming, the question would require further consideration. Id; f . The India Office, on receipt of this letter, consulted all the local authorities concerned, but although the Governor of Aden and the Resident at fJnnH.r TiK q P re P ared t0 , a g r j ee t0 the arbitration of the Saudi Protectorate reolv of L ori 11011 we y d f lded °n purely legal grounds, the India Office :o;&gt;. , |, e ! )th August stated that neither the Government of India nor the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf found it possible to support the proposed offer to submit the dispute to arbitration.

Paragraph 3: I think that undoubtedly as far as Abu Dhabi is concerned the position relating to Saudis has weakened during the last 9 years. The reasons for this may be (a) Increase in wealth of the Saudis which gives them the greater pull with the tribes and undoubtedly the Manasir ; some of whom owe allegiance to Ibn Saud,and some to Abu Dhabi. My impression is that the Ruler of Abu Dhabi has lost a few of his Manasirs during this period although he would never admit it if asked. (b) The slave trade in Buraimi which has encouraged' Saudi slavers 1 motor vehicles to cross the Sabkha Matti to a point somewhere west of Buraimi and there meet the caravans bringing slaves. I believe that atleast one motor route across the Sabkha Matti within four miles of the coast has actually been opened up in this manner. The Saudi slave dealers have also taken houses in Burairci and no doubt the this Saudis could quote/as evidence of sovereignty. I ratherthink that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has kept silent over this matter because, although to the best of my knowledge his own hands are clean he has been either too apathetic or powerless to stop the traffic across the more remote part of bis western t territories. Reference paragraph 7: Mr. Scott Fox suggests that the &lt;£&gt;/. Saudis might hoist their flag in the disputed area. I would suggest that we ought to urge the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to make some sort of gesture of this kind in Odaid, Dhuwaihin and Silah. Owing to the failure of rains all that area isnow empty of bedouin, and the rapid construction of small watch towers even camps in places' which from our point of view are indisputably in Abu Dhabi territory,would give the lie to Saudi claim that they have gained control right up to the coast. . ^ /\/pasu*. 57J 3-7-49.

A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file comprises correspondence, memoranda, maps, and other papers relating to questions over the position of Saudi Arabia’s south-eastern frontier adjoining Qatar and the Trucial Coast shaikhdoms, notably Abu Dhabi. Negotiations over the frontier had long been deferred by British Government officials, as a result of the Ruler of Saudi Arabia ‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd’s [Ibn Saud] firm stance in negotiations before the Second World War. However, the need for a resolution became increasingly apparent as a result of ongoing oil exploration in Saudi Arabia by the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco), and exploration in Qatar and Abu Dhabi by Petroleum Concessions Limited (PCL). The principal correspondents in the file include: representatives of the India Office, Foreign Office, Ministry of Fuel and Power; the British Legation at Jedda; the Political Agent at Bahrain; and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.The file includes:correspondence, dating from 1944 and 1945, between British Government officials in the Persian Gulf, India Office and Foreign Office, discussing the previous difficulties encountered in negotiating Saudi Arabia’s south-eastern frontiers with Ibn Saud, and the agreement that further negotiations be left until after the event of Ibn Saud’s death (ff 2-29);correspondence from late 1945 through 1947, between Government officials on the possible establishment of a neutral zone between Aramco’s concession area in Saudi Arabia, and PCL’s concession area in Qatar. Also, there is some discussion of Aramco’s proposals to begin seabed exploration off the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia (ff 36-59);PCL’s request for permission to conduct seismic surveys at the southernmost limit of their concession area in Qatar (ff 76-95);reports of Aramco survey parties making incursions into PCL’s concession areas in Qatar and Abu Dhabi (ff 104-127);Government criticism of PCL’s delay in exploiting its concession areas in Qatar and Abu Dhabi (f 133);preparations in August 1949 for the reopening of frontier negotiations with the Saudi Government in Jedda. Papers include: a copy of a confidential memorandum with map, dated 2 February 1948, on the south-eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia, prepared by J E Cable of the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office (ff 164-169; copy also at ff 87-91); three further confidential memoranda with maps, prepared by the Eastern Department in 1940, outlining past and present negotiations on the position of the south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia (ff 170-180, ff 181-185, ff 186-188); proposals to send representatives from Qatar and Abu Dhabi to the Jedda negotiations (ff 190-203).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Concessions Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office, Eastern Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arabian American Oil Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Abu Dhabi</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Al-Hasa Province</topic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Qatar</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000280#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
