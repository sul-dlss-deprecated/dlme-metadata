(b'l 'FOWEY' leaves Bahrein on 22nd May, visits AWHabi and Sharjah only , and returns to Bahrein on 25th May.

(d) ''FOWEY' leaves Bahrein on 29th May for a tour of Southern Section returning to Bahrein about 7th June.

There are many islands round about Abu Dhabi, but you would require about a week or so in order to see them, and perhaphs you would like to go to them when you have more time* Perhaps it would be interesting to see the good lagoons between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, where fishing is also avai/flable and this I have included in the programme* The Shaikh has a ruined house on the sea shore in which he usually keeps his distinguished guests, but it has no lavatory* If you stay on shore the Shaikh supplies you with cooked food and, in accordance with the Arab customs, would not allow other arrangements being made by you. in my opinion it would be more comfortable if you would stay on the launch and if you cannot bring the launch from Bahrain, I will arrange to hire or take on loan, the launch of the Shaikh of Dubai. The motor car takes between six to eight hours from Sharjah, to Abu Dhabi but the road is very bad on account of the sand hills.

You would pro bably recollect that it is possible that the Superintend ent will be coming to Bahrain to examine the question of agriculture and I was able to give him a quantity of in formation which would enable him to arrive here prepared for the work which he is expected to undertake. 3.
