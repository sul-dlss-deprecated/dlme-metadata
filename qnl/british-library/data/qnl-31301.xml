WITH THE COMPLIMENTS OF HIS MAJESTY’S POLITICAL RESIDENCY ple&lt;vu BRITISH RESIDENCY, Bahrain. 24th November, 1951. PERSIAN GULF.} A Note on. the Imam* s Administration in the interior of Oman The Imam The rules for the appointment of Imam are as follows:- 1# Ke is elected by the Mullas and Tribal Loaders, 2 ft He must be a man of good bearing and reputation^, of a pious disposition and well versed in religious matters, 3- He should not be from a large tribe which is able to exercise its influence beyond its own tribal borders® 4* He is elected only after the decease of his predecessor® Shaikhs There is no special election of Shaikhs, and tribal leadership usually falls to the son or brother or other nearest male relative, depending to some extent upon acceptance by the tribe as a whole. Extent of the Administration The Imam’s influence extends over the territories of the tribes which support hiiru Broadly defined this is from the southern border of Dhahirah province, in the north west of the Sultanate, along the mountainous ridge of Western and Eastern Hajar almost to the coast in Sharqiyah and Jala’an, bounded on the South by the Rub el Khali desert and on the North by the territories of the tribes which support the Suit an© The Capital and residence of the The tribes at present supporting the Imam are:~ Beni Ghafir Beni Habus el Hadadabah Beni Hadrami Beni Hajriyin Beni Harras el Harth Beni bu Hassan Beni Hinah el Ibriyin Beni Jabir Beni Kkarus el Kinud el Ma'awal Beni Mahariq el Masakrah el Masharifah Beni Nabban el Nadabiyan Rahbiyin Beni Ruwahah Beni Shakail el Siyabiyin Yal Wahibah el Ya’aqib el Ya’aribah el Yaman Imam is NIZWA® Further particulars regarding these tribes will be found in the 'Notes on the Tribes of the Sultanate of Muscat &amp; Oman'* The Administration ( a ) O fficials ® All are appointed by the Imam. (i) The Qadhls (Judges), If the Imam has a good knowledge of the Shara Law, as in the present case, he is himself the Chief Qadhi® Other Qadhis are appointed in accordance with their influence and knowledge in the various cities and villages in /which.•©2 © \ which Walls arc appointed. Appeals are heard by the Chief Qadhi. A Qadhi’s salary varies from Rials 30 to 70 a month, plus a supply of dates for his winter use. (ii) The Walls (Governors) are men of influence p but, except in some cases where the office is given as a remunera tion to the tribal leader, they are not the leading Shaikhs, and are normally not posted in territories in which they have a tribal connection. Their duties are to defend the teiritory, supervise the officials and adminisoration generally and to ensure that the laws and the orders of the Courts are obeyed. Their residence is usually a fort, and they are supplied with askars (armed village police or levies) to assist them. A list of the present Walls and their posts is attached. Their salaries vary from Rials 50 to 200 a month, or the revenue of the district. (iii) Clerks and other petty officials are as under Collectors of £akat (salary about Rials 15 p,m,). Clerks of the Qadhis( M n M 7 to 15 M ) Clerks to the markets( ' M n 10 p 0 m, ) (with small powers to settle disputes oh the spot). Market Police (salary about Rials 7 to TO 1 ') (to assist the clerks) Teachers ( 11 M M 10 p.m,). (b) Currency . The rial is the Maria Theresa silver dollar, and though reproduced from time to time by private firms always bears the date of 1780 This is the only acceptable coin in the interior, although it is supplemented by some copper coins called baizas counting 100 to the dollar in denominations of 5, 10 &amp; 20 c The dollar, being made of pure silver, fluctuates in value with the price of silver and also with the demand for it during the date season. Its average value is about 3/6 sterling. R evenue Several properties belong to the :; State ;! , and the income goes to the department known as the 'Bait cl Mal n , and is intended for the upkeep of the official administra tion. In addition the following taxes are levied Zakat . A tax on crops, sheep, camels, cattle and the manufacture of ornaments. Market Tax . A simple tax on all sales in the market. Endowments . Mostly to finance small schools, wills or other charities by persons in their wills. These revenues and taxes are collected by the officials appointed by the Imam and are intended to go to the central Treasury. There are however many defalcations and refusals to pay, and the Imam has made several fruitless attempts to appoint a Revenue Inspector to chock the accounts of the Walls and other officials, but no one is willing to take the post, or if he takes it, is able to deal with the more influential people . /Fortuna toly • o •3 Fortunately tho Imam is himself possessed of considerable properties from which he derives adequate revenues, and many of tho Walls are expected to carry on their administration and remunerate themselves and their officials from the revenues to be collected in their districts, (d) Security, Law &amp; Order, Arms &amp; Equipment . Shara law governs everything, and all offences and dis putes arising out of transactions of any nature are settled by the Qadhis in accordance with it. Besides the Koran there are several works in Arabic dealing with the Law, and the Qadhis and people generally have a good knowledge of it, and it is seldom abused. Nearly every tribesman of the interior possesses and can handle arms of some sort. They are quick to unite to resist aggression or interference in their affairs. They resent and are highly suspicious of intrusion by foreigners, and can be expected to offer opposition to any attempt to exploit the natural resources of their country, as they believe that this will result only in a lessening of their independence and little material benefit, financial or otherwise, to themselves. The Imam maintains no standing Army, but employs about two thousand Askars posted as village police and garrisons of the forts throughout his territory to assist the Walls and Qadhis in their duties and for their protection, and, of course, his own. The pay of an AskarI is about 4 Rials a month, and that of a Head Askari about 10 Rials. 'Hinawi” Askars must serve in Hinawi territory, and :i Ghafaris M in Ghafari territory. A fairly plentiful supply of old fashioned rifles exist (ranging from muzie loaders to single breach loading ,450 Martini Henrys), whilst a few tribesmen seem to have acquired some quite modern weapons (.303 magazine Lee Enfields). Those that cannot obtain fresh ammunition, make their ov/n cartridges from fired cases, scrap and a locally made powder. With the suppression of the former traffic in arms and ammunition, tho Sultan, who can import his requirements from the United Kingdom, has a considerable inducement to offer those who might other wise not wish to seek his favour. Some of tho old cannon in the forts may be capable of use. Swords and daggers complete their armament. (e) Medical. There is no provision for medicine, mid wifery etc.: The nearest hospitals or medical aid are in Muscat, Matrah and Dubai. The American Mission doctor at Matrah is sometimes invited to visit the interior, (f) Education. The only schools are those maintained In mosques by the Mullahs for imparting the teachings of the Koran to children, and small buildings in gardens maintained from charitable endowments which teach Arabic grammar and the Shara law, in addition. The teachers are paid from these fund s. /(g) General • • •(g) General. The Imam makes no attempt to issue passports for foreign travel, and all Omanis, except one or two recalcitrants such as Sulaiman bin Hamyar of the Jebal Akhdar region, who is tx^ying for complete independence, obtain Omani passports signed by the Sultan, The Sultanate and Imam’s courts appear to find no difficulty in working in co-operation in such matters as the administration and disposal of the estates of deceased persons, and Joint action is sometimes taken in matters of public security and mutual defence 0 The present Sultan seems also to be in much closer touch with the Imam over their foreign relations than many people may think. He also appears to have complete confidence in his interpretation of the feelings of the Shaikhs of the Interior, many of whom regularly visit him, and the Imam’s support in nis dealings with foreign interests© Such dealings the Imam seems content to leave to the Sultan, whilst the latter makes no attempt to interfere with the former. In other words they both seem to be implementing the Treaty of Sib of 1920, perhaps even more in the spirit than in the letter, and the tribes, themselves, have enjoyed a period of peace since that date, unrivalled in their history© A short precis of the history of the events leading up to the separation of the two administrations, the establishment of a separate Imam, and their reconciliation by the Treaty of Sib is attached©Brief narrative of events to show how the office of Imam of Oman ceased to be vested in the person of the Ruler of Muscat and Oman and the relations existing between them at the present time ( 1951 )® Until 1793 the Rulers of Muscat and Oman were elected, and their capital was maintained at Kostaq in the interior -until 1783o Thereafter it was transferred to the coast at Muscat, as a result of which much of the control over the tribes of the interior was lost 0 Following the usurpation of power by Saiyid Sultan in 1793&gt; and abandonment of the formality of election of the rulers thereafter, the tribes of the interior began to regard the Rulers as usurpers, and a series of rebellions took place between 1829 and 1867 , culminating in seizure of power by a junior branch of the ruling family, supported by some of the tribeSn He was however overthrown in 1871? hy the legitimate branch* Thereafter numerous attempts to dislodge the Sultans were made by the Omani tribes, whoso feelings were further incensed by the stoppage of the arms and the slave traffic.^ both of which are permitted by Islam, at the instigation of the Christian Powers* These culminated in a carefully organised rebellion in 191 * 3 © In fulfilment of a guarantee given to the Sultan in 1895s which was also communicated to the Shaikhs of Oman, British military assistance was provided and a crushing defeat was inflicted upon the tribal forces which in uanuary 1915 attacked the British outposts at Bait al Falaj, stationed there for the protection of Muscat* By 1916, howeve the rebel tribes had obtained complete control of the interior known as Oman proper, and had established a government in it under their own Imam* They would undoubtedly have taken Muscat and all the coastal towns had it not been for the Military and Naval assistance which the British Government were ready to afford, and also financial and other assistance supplied to restore an} improve the Administratioru In the end only after several attempts by the British Political authorities to effect a reconciliation, and after a further demonstration of force and economic pressure and the murder of the Imam by his tribes, was the Political Agent of the $ime able to promote further negotiations which, on the 25 th September 1920, terminated in the signing of an agreement.- known since as the Treaty of Sib 0 Under the terms of this agreement the Sultan undertook not to interfere in the internal affairs of the tribes; not to impose more than 5 °* taxation on their produce brought into the coastal towns; to allow members of the tribes to come and go freely and to return fugitive criminals 0 In return the tribes agreed to remain in peace and friendship with the Sultan, not to interfere with his government or to attack the coastal towns; not to impose any restrictions on trade; to permit travellers to pass freely; to turn out fugitive criminals and to dispose of all claims in accordance with the Shara law#LIST OF WALTS APPOINTED BY THE IMAM Place or District Adam el AwaLi BAHLA BidHid Bidiyyah Hamra IBri Izki JeHal Akhdar Jala’an (Balad Lu Hassan) Ma* a-wil Manah Nakhl Nizwa Name of Walrl ILrahim eldest son. of Mohaiiimed Lin Salim el Rukaie'ii Henarks on Behalf of his father who is actually the Wali of Ahri* Adam and Izki.

WITH THE COMPLIMENTS OF HIS MAJESTY’S POLITICAL RESIDENCY BAHRAIN. PERSIAN GULF.SECRET NOTES ON THE TRIB ES OF THE SU LT ANATE OF MUSCAT A ND OMAN In writing any account of the Tribes of Muscat and Oman, two salient factors have to he realised at the oinfset. The first is that all the tribes, whatever their religion - Sunni, Ibadhi, Wahabi - have divided themselves since the Civil War of 1723 into two great political factions, Ghafiri and Hinawi, named after the tribal names of the then rival leaders. The second is that though the Sultan is recognised by most of the outside world, and especially the United States of America, Prance and Britain with whom he has treaties, as an independent monarch of the whole tract of land, the districts of which v/ill presently be described, he has practically no authority over any of the tribes out of the immediate vicinity of Muscat, Sur, Dhofar and the Batinah coastal towns. In fact the tribes of the interior regard themselves, by virtue of the Treaty of Sib (1920), as completely independent of his authority, as, indeed, a perusal of the terms of that treaty will tend to show, though the intention no doubt was to provide no more than a measure of home rule. These tribes have grouped themselves together under a triumvirate consisting of the Imam, Mohammad bin Abdulla al Khalili, their elected religious leader, Shaikh Salih bin Isa al Harthi, Tamirnah of all the Hinawi political faction, and Shaikh Sulaiman bin Hamyar, Tamimah of all the Ghafiris. The Imam appoints his own Walls and collects and administers the revenue and lays down the laws, religious and temporal, in which he is bigct^'ed and almost fanatically opposed to progress or penetration from without*, the Imam, himself, is getting old and has in any case probably never wielded any great power except with the support of his two lieutenants. In fact the whole edifice of this virtually independent tribal kingdom depends upon the support of these two Shaikhs, who appear to have gained and continue to exercise as much influence and authority as their fathers. The latter were, without question, the most influential. Omani shaikhs of their day, and similarly formed a triumvirate with the Imam and his predecessor, who was murdered in the disturbed times immediately preceding the Treaty of Sib# The general situation now (30th April 1951) appears to be that the Imam has not confirmed the nomination of any definite successor which he is believed to have made during his illness in 1948. Shaikh Sulaiman bin Hamyar, the Ghafiri leader, is, however, said to be still sponsoring the candidature of Abdulla, the second son of the previous Imam, and one of the present Walis. This is opposed by Shaikh Saleh bin Isa, the Hinawi leader, who wants the next Imam to be a Hinawi. He appears to have no actual nominee at present, though Shaikh Abdulla bin Ali Khalili, a nephew of the existing Imam, is mentioned. In the meantime the Sultan is wooing both leaders with presents and hospitality to obtain their allegiance and to neutralize the position of the Imam generally. He is, however, careful not to make this apparent, and maintains friendly correspondence and relations generally with the Imam. He hopes that upon the death of the Imam, the tribes influenced by these leaders and persuaded that reform, development and financial benefit are only to be found through the Sultan, will discard the idea of an Imamate altogether, and unite with the rest of the Sultanate into one kingdom with himself as head. But in all this the Sultan cannot afford to overlook the susceptibilities of the old fashioned tribesmen, particularly the puritanical and reactionary© A reactionary rbadhis, and this fact may help towards an understanding of the extreme caution invariably displayed by the Sultan in sponsoring any move for modernisation or development. What may seem depressingly slow to a western mind may be considered dangerously fast in this backwater of Arabia. It also explains, though not necessarily excuses, certain tiresome petty restrictions in the capital. Shaikh Sulaiman bin Hamyar, who is ambitious and more progressive than most of the Shaikhs, has also ideas of securing recognition of himself as an independent Shaikh, and has made certain overtures, without success, to the British authorities, and, it is thought, may now be looking into the possibilities of achieving his purpose through American and Saudi contacts. Besides him and Salih bin Isa, the only other Shaikhs enjoying complete power and backing of their tribes to the extent of imposing capital punishment are Saif bin Amir of the Beni f Ali in Dhahirah and Nasir bin Mohammad of Beni bu ’Ali in Ja ! alan, and it is through these men that the Sultan hopes to be able to extend his influence over the tribes of the interior. Saif bin Amir is already a close friend and may prove helpful in the Buraimi area*, The Imam recently demonstrated that his rule still possesses considerable virility when he raised and successfully delegated a force of three or four hundred to recover some kidnapped women a.nd to deal with certain leaders of Dnahirah suspected of complicity. This was done in co-operation v/ith the Muscat Government, and there have been other signs of a certain unity of mind and of purpose existing between the Sultan, Imam and the more powerful leaders, mentioned above, in dealing with external influences, whilst a number of smaller Shaikhs in the Jau and Mahadhah tracts (Beni Ka'ab, el Na f im and al bu Shami have been writing affirming their loyalty and recognition of the Sultan. Though Sulaiman bin hamyar and one or two of the Buraimi Shaikhs show signs of willingness to negotiate for oil development the bulk of the Shaikhs of the interior, headed by the Imam, appear solidly op &gt;osed to ic or to any exploitation by Europeans or Americans, and the Sultan is convinced that it is still unsafe and premature for attempts to be made, and that no single Shaikh could enter into direct negotiations without bringing all the others against him, thus rendering him impotent. ^ At present, therefore, Oman enjoys a.spell of peace almost withoutparallel in its turbulent history, but upon the death ^f the Imam, and bid for power by rival elements which will surely follow, the situation is liable to any development. Much will depend- upon the ground which the Sultan^has been able to gain, and the evidence of support which is forthcoming from the powers with whom he has treaties. The Sultans have almost invariably asked for and received suoport both Naval and Military, from the British Government in' their struggles with the tribes of Oman. The most recent occasion was shortly after the accession of the present Sultan, when three sloops, including H.M.S. Shoreham with the Sultan, Political Resident, Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, and the Political Agent on board, concentrated at Sur, whilst ^ demonstration by R.A.F. sea planes from abase established at Khor Jaramah was carried out to bring Shaikh All bin Abdulla al Hamud of the Beni bu Ali to order after he had defined the Sultan over the establishment of a Customs post.A request in 19^6 for a promise of Royal Air Force assistance in a plan to subjugate the Oman tribes upon the death of the Imam was, however ? refused 0 A list of the majority of tribes to be found in the Sultanate has been compiled from Colonel Miles’ list included in his administration report of 1880 and from such meagre and often unreliable information as is available® Some no-oes have also been compiled on those tribes which are more frequently met with or upon which attention is from time to time focused owing to their depredations or other activities directed against the Sultan’s authority or one another* Some of the tribes listed by Miles have been omitted either as too depleted for inclusion, or as having been found to be sub-sections of another tribe 0 A few tribes, notably those of the Dhofar district, have been added,, This information should be treated only as supple mentary to the much more extensive and ably compiled notes contained in Lorimer’s Gazetteer (1905), and the latter should invariably be consulted when more detailed information is required,, These notes are in fact merely an attempt to bring the information more up to date® They are neither exhaustive nor, as indicated, can their accuracy be vouched for, though where there is a sharp difference from previous accounts, such steps as are possible have been taken to check up on the information. Figures of population and rifles must necessarily be estimates of the crudest kind, and the stated tendencies of the tribes may be no more than the hopes of the informants. It will be noted that for the most part the population has considerably decreased,. This is scarcely surprising since, apart from epidemics, which, though cholera and plague have taken severe toll, have been mercifully few, there has been a constant exodus in recent times to the oil fields, and the Muscat Consulate has for some years issued visas on Omani passports at the rate of some three thousand a year. From these revised estimates it will be seen that the tribal population of the Sultanate may be less than two hundred thousand, and, with the c.osmopolitan population of the coastal towns, including Muscat, Mutrah and Gwadur, the whole population of the Sultanate js probably not in excess of three hundred thousand, and former estimates of 'naif a million are very likely excessive® The Sultan himself, though frequently approached, either t'lrough genuine ignorance or an unexplained desire for secrecy, has supplied no information of value, though few persons can have had better opportunity for accumulating knowledge through actual contact than his present Minister for the Interior, Saiyid Ahmed bin Ibrahim. His officials are no more helpful in this matter and information must be gleaned despite them rather than with their assistance 0For a better understanding of these notes a brief enumeration of the provinces or districts of the Sultanate may be helpful here. To the north covering the whole tip of the Oman promontory is the Poius al Jibal. Southward (omitting Shamailiyah which is not Sultanate territory) is the Batinah - the coastal plain reaching down almost to Muscat e West of the Batinah is Western Hajar, which includes the Jibal Akhdar mountain range. Further inland is DHAHIRAH and, somewhat north, the Jau and Mahadhah tracts, both of doubtful ownership. South and East lie Oman proper, Eastern Hajar and Sharqiyah, and then following the coast southward, Jala*an, Batain and, finally, at the southernmost extremity, adjoining the Hadramaut of the Aden Protectorate, Dhofar, The present situation is one of geheral peace, v/ith the Sultan’s influence slightly increasing in the coastal districts, e,g, Batinah, Dhofar and Sharqiyah and far better established than in his father’s day. It seems a pity that so many of his Walis are s^ie cted from his own tribe and are often near relations. In Oman proper and Dhahihrah, and East and West Hajar ? the Triumvirate continue their rule, and when it comes to it, it seems that the vote will almost certainly be for continuation of the Imamship in a person other than the Sultan, otherwise this independence will be lost, and at present the most likely candidate, and one who certain quarters insist has already been nominated, is the second son of the previous Imam, Abdulla bin Salim bin Rashid al Kharusi, aged at present about thirtyeight. However, though seventytwo and despite recurring rumours of failing health, the present Imam is by no means yet dead or even dying, A still more nebulous condition prevails in the Buraimi (i,e, Jau) area, There it v/ould seem that neither the Imam nor the Sultan nor any other chief has any paramount authority and the four chief tribes claimed by the Sultan to be Omani and within his territories, the Naim, Beni Ka’ab, Beni Qitab and Al Bu Shamis (actually an offshoot of the Naim) are virtually independent and likely to remain so until it is seen who wins in the bid for oil expected to be developed in that neighbourhood. Nearly all the Shaikhs visited the Sultan in 1948 and received hospitality and presents from him. The general consensus of opinion however, seems to have been that he v/as niggardly in his gifts and not many will feel it worth the effort or the trouble to come again. The Sultan is certainly careful with his money, and reports of his large increase in revenue from Customs with no corresponding increase in largesse or amenities have also aroused unfavourable comment in quarters other than purely tribal. But in this case the Sultan probably realises the dominating influence of the two principal Hinawi and Ghafiri Shaikhs, and has concentrated upon them. He certainly treated them handsomely enough as can be seen from the notes upon their tribes, though to what avail time only will show. /Religion,,,Religion itself plays little or no part in the tribal politics and no mention has been made of it in the notes 0 For details of the religion of each tribe reference may be made to Lorimer's Gazetteer* The bulk of the Hinawi tribes belongs to the Ibadhi sect of Islam, whilst of their Ghafiri opponents considerable numbers are orthodox Sunnis, and a few follow the Wahabi faith, to which they were converted at the time of the Wahabi invasions in the early 19th century* But the dominant sect is still Ibadhi, whose tenets were adopted as the national Omani faith in *che 8 th century of the Christian era, and whose outlook is puritanical and reactionary* For the present even the Hinawi and Ghafiri rivalry seems to have died down under the Omani triumvirate, and the chief rivalry, though fortunately at present of a peaceful nature, is between the Sultan and the Imam, Upon the letters death anything may happen, violent or otherwise, and it is well nigh’ impossible to predict, though signs are in favour of a contimatlcn of present arrangements 0 The Sultan, on the other hand, is trying hard, and seems confident of his ultimate success. This would certainly make for greater unity in the Sultanate as a whole, and t since all treaties and concessions are with the Sultan and cover only his dominions, suit British interests better. It would seem desirable therefore that the Sultan should receive British support wherever possible: a factor which in itself might be decisive, BENI ALI The present strength of this tribe is now about two thousand. It could muster perhaps one thousand riflemen. Their capital is Yankul in Western Hajar and they have settlements along the Wadi Dhank and in Saham, The majority are poor and cultivstors, whilst a few engage in trade. With the exception of the FIDHA sub-section consisting of about five hundred persons, they are of mild disposition, and fairly friendly with British and other foreigners. Their Shaikh, Saif bin Amir, is said to be a sincere friend of the present Sultan and gets a monthly allowance of about Rs, 60/-, He lives at Yankul and visited Muscat in August 1949 and stayed as the Sultan’s guest for three months. He is about forty years old and has two sons, the eldest, Amir, being his heir. He is liked and recognised by his tribe, and appears to be much more intelligent than his people. As a Hinawi, his connexion with Salih bin Isa al Harthi (see note on A1 Harth) is good. It is also good with the Imam (see note on Beni Ruwahah), It is not likely that he could rally any but his own tribe to his assistance in case of war or similar trouble, but his authority over his tribe is said to extend to the passing of death sentences BENI BU ALI One of the two chief tribes in Sharqiyah and Jala’an. Its capital is Balad Beni bu Ali, forty miles south of Sur, The tribe is at feud with the Beni bu Hassan (q.v.) and as Wahabis they are alliod with the Beni Rasib. They are o.lso allied w r ith the al Hishm, Many are bedouins, and wild. Such as follow /settled 0 .•settled pursuits are cultivators, seamen and camel and donkey drivers, A very few trade with merchants in India and Pakistan, Their Tamimah is Nasir bin Mohammad al Hamud, aped about forty. Ho is believed to be on pood terms with the Sultan and to have the support of his tribe and to exercise absolute power over it. He is also reported to be well disposed towards the British, and it seems that the military action taken apainst this tribe in 1932 was salutary, EL /y/AMIR . The Awamir arc a poor but numerous tribe of Oman proper. Their capital is Aqil or Qala and about three thousand a re settled in the Sultanate, Povert ' has scattered them, and they live in small settlements pottinp their living as cultivators, donkc'' and camel men. There is a bedouin section which may amount to seven thousand ranpinp the interior alone: the odye cf the Kuba’al Khali. The settled, portion could muster perhaps fifteen hundred riflemen, and though normally peaceful, they often fall out with the Beni Ruwahah. Some of the bedouin portion arc known as ’Afar from the part where they live between Dhofar and Mahot, Ver' poor, they live as bandits and enparc in kidnappinp. There is a sottlcmont of about two hundred at al Mobailah (near Sib) ackncwledrinp the Sultan, and rclat ons with him ore aonerally friendly. This section under Shaikh Ali bin Mansur bin Ghalib al Amri is at feud with the Hewssinohs, and in Fobrrary 1950 a fracas occurred which was only prevented from developing seriously by the active intervention of the Muscat Government. Nevertheless, and in spite of their feuds with the Beni Ruwaba, the Imar ’s tribe, the Awamir as a whole arc not likely to vote for the Sultan upon the death of the present Imam. Their atti tude to the British is pood. Their Tamimah is Khamis bin Rashid bin Nasir residinp at Qala apod abcut fifty. The* have another Shaikh, named Hamad bin Rashid ared about forty, livinp at Quryatin. The Tamimah wields complete authority over the settled sections of the tribe. Both Shaikhs visited the Sultan in 1948 and received presents of Rs. 375/- and Rs. 250/- respec tively. (The presents are actually always in M.T. Dollars, the onl* currency recopnised in the interior), FIN-TI BATTASH. The Beni Battash is a sturdy tribe of hast Ha jar. The chief villa res are 1;i ayara and Hailphaf, whilst about two hundred live at Hiddah and many other villa pcs in the Wadi Tayin, runninp down to the sea at Qurmat. They ha.ve poed rifles and arc be lieved to have at least a thousand mostly imported from Africa. Their pursuits are seafarinp, cultivation and tradinp. None arc bedruins. A few trade with Zanzibar. They have always been at enmity with the Wahiba. Though their altitude to the Sultan is friendly they will not be likely to vote for him as Imam on the death of the present incumbent. Their Tamimah is Mohammad bin Harth residinp at Mayara aped about fifty and they have another shaikh, Mohammad bin Shamis bin Mohammad Alwardi, also livinp at Mayara. Both visited the Sultan at Muscat in 1948 and received Rs. 750/- and Rs. 375/- rc spec lively. They appoc.r to like the mritish. EL DARU • • •EL BAKU The Daru is c. wild r.nd wandering tribo of bodov.ins, though sections have settled in Dhahirah and Batinah Districts, at Tana*am and Barka. The; collect mostly about Jobcl Hamrah, and ran.ae about from Dhahirah to Sharqiyah plyin.o camels for hire for the carriage of dried dates. The': arc poor, treacherous and warlike, and are at feud with the Wahid a . Their Tamimah, Mohammad bin Sultan, apod about fifty, and a Shaikh, Mohammad bin Said, a fed about forty, visited the Sultan in 1948 and re ceived presents of Rs. 200 /- each. The' seem to be on food terms with him and those one meets appear well disposed towards the British, The whole tribe mibht muster two thousand rifles, and may be about six thousand strong. PERI GI-IAFI R J or EL MP r AYIHAH ) . The Beni Ghafir is in two main divisions. One division lives around Khafdi, near Rostak. Their Tamimah is Mohammad bin Nasir bin Rashid, and his brother Khalid is a Shaikh• The former is about fifty and the latter forty five. In 1948 they visited the Sultan and received presents of Rs. 500/- oach. They are close friends of Saiyid Ahmed bin Ibrahim, the Minister of the Interior, himself a tribal influence. Their strength is about two thousand with some seven hundred rifles. They are mostly date cultivators, but some who are enaafed in trade with India, Zanzibar and Africa arc possessed of con siderable means. This division of the tribe is at feud with the Ibriyin. Outwardly they are friendly with both the Sultan and the Imam and their attitude to the British is food. They are settled and normally peaceful. The second division lives around Driz in the Dhahirah District. It numbers fifteen hundred and possesses about four hundred rifles. These people are bedouins, poor and warlike, onfapina in cultivation and camel drivinf. In alliance with the first division they are also at feud with the Ibriyin, Though friendly with the Sultan, they are under the Imam’s in fluence and will not vote for the Sultan to succeed him. Their Tamimah is Ali bin Said aped about seventy. When he visited the Sultan, also in 1948, ho received Rs. 475/-. The tribe fives its name to the Ghafiri political faction to which it belonps, EL HABUS. The Habus is an uncivilised tribe of Sharqiyah whose popula tion, which, however, appears to be declining only entitles it to be mentioned. The people live around Madaibi (their capital) and Rowdha, and are primarily date cultivators and camel-men. They are in alliance with the Hirth tribe and at feud with the Wahiba, Their disposition towards the British and the Sultan is rood, but they would probably not support the latter's candi dature for the Imamship, Their Tamimah, Khalid bin Hilal last visited the Sultan in 1948 and received a present of Rs. 575/-.

They have their own dialect but know Arabic. Normally friendly to foreigners they recognise the Sultan and visit him in Dhofar. They are, however, diffi cult to deal v/ith as althourh now a small tribe of possibly no more than a few hundred males, they have several petty Shaikhs. Their Chief, though only nominally so, appears to bo Sharqi bin Akas of the Bait Aksit. Other baits or sections are Mutaira, She.' ia, Qr.dhran, Afari, and Barhauh. lYHTHARRiS . The population of the Beni Karras is about two thousand with not more than four hundred rifles. Their capital is Jammah in Western Ha.jar, and they also live around Nakhl and Sainail, Thourh poor they are fairly civilized and peaceable, enya-'ed mostly in cultivation and donkey drivinp. Their enemies are the Ma’awal, and allies the Beni Riyam. Their Tamimah is Zahran bin Mohammad bin Talib, who lives at Jammah, thou/h tv/o years a r, .o he was head of Askaris at Sor. Haviny left Muscat Government service he boupht a motor car and is now runninp it as a taxi between Muscat and Dubai. He drives himself. He is not liked by the Sultan and is reparded as unimportant, which he appears to be. BE NI BIT HASSAN . The Beni Bu Hassan, though resomblinp bedouins are settled rainl;; around Baled Bu Hassan in the Jala*an District near Sur. They are enpamod mostly in the cultivation of dates and camel drivinp. They number some tv/o thousand and are fairly v/ell armed with cheap rifles, and are almost perpetually enraged in potty feuds with their noiphbours, the Beni Bu Ali and the El Hi shin. Their allies arc the Hajriyin, Hirth and Habua . They maintain a friendly attitude with the Sultan, but are not likely to accept him as successor to the present Imam, under whose in fluence they fall. Their Tamimah is Hamud bin Rashid, aped about forty, and his control ever them seems o, ood. He visited the Sultan in 1948 and received. Rs. 75C/-. Bo th the • • •Both the Imam and the Sultan have appointed Walls to con trol the tribes of Jala'an (the Beni bu Hasaan and Beni Rasib). Ahmed bin Mohammad al Hart hi is the Imam’s, and Salim bin Hamid the Sultan’s. The former lives at Balad Bu Hass an and the latter at Kamil, about twenty miles north. BEH I HIHAH . The Beni Hinah is a tribe of about one thousand strong with perhaps five hundred rifles. They are somewhat scattered but found mostly in Hf. jar in the Wadis Samail and Beni Ghafir. Their chief centre is Nizwa in Oman proper, whilst some are settled in the Batinah and in Dhahirah. Their Tamimah is Zahir bin G-husn, who is also the Imam’s Wall at Rostak. The Hinawi faction takes its name from this tiibe. Thourh invited several times&gt; the Tamimah refuses to visit the Sultan, and the tribe remains close to the Imam, They appear friendly but are a treacherous people. They are at feud with Beni Ghafir. Most are occupied in cultivation and camel driving, but a few trade with Dubai and Sharjah, ILL HIRTH (o r EA RTH OR HORTH) . The Hirth is an important tribe of the Sharqiyah District settled around Baldeh a I Harthi, and their capital Ibra. Some are also found on the Batinah near Sib. Salih bin Isa is their Tamimah. He is also Tamimah of all the Hinawis and probably, like his father, the most influential Shaikh in Oman. He is, at least outwardly, on r, ood terms with the Sultan, and the ex tent to which the latter values his support can be judred by com parison of the rifts made to him in 1948 with those to other Shaikhs. Salih stayed as the Sultan’s auest for three months and received rifles and ammunition and Rs. 6,000/-. It is said that he enjoys complete power, even to passing sentences of death, over his own tribe and. all the ^inawis. The Hirtb arc intelligent and, besides the cultivation of dates, enr-ape in trade, mostly with Zanzibar, in 'Tice, fish, cotton and hides . Their numbers af tier a decline seem to be in- creasinr and they are spreading all over Sharqiyah. Their strength nay be five thousand with two or three thousand rifles of as rood quality as can bo found in Oman, Salih has a nephew Ahmad, son of his brother Mohammad who was Tamimah before Salih on the death of their father Isa. Ahmad’s claim to succeed his father failed, and he is not on rood terms with Salih, but lacks Influence and tribal support Generally. The tribe is in alliance with all the Hinawi tribes, and at feud with the Masakirah. Attitude to the British is rood, and Shaikh Salih calls on the Consul at Muscat. He n.ormally lives at Kabil (or Qabil) a few miles south of Muscat. EL HISHM . The capital of the Hishm tribe is Kamil in Jala’an, and their population about two thousand, with about one tbxusand rifles. They occupy a rood strategical position between Sur and Jala’an and have a stronp bedouin section. They arc warlike and said to be robbers. They have, however, always supported the Sultan, and hate the Imam. Their attitude to the British is very rorG. Their more settled pursuits are fishinp, cultivation and car. el rear! nr. Their Shaikhs arc Khadim bin Mohammad ared about fifty, Hu]a is bin Khadim (not the former’s son) amod about fifty-five and Abdulla bin Said bin Rashid ared about sixty. There is no Tamimah ..,Tamim&amp;h but all three live at Kamil amicably, and would support the Sultan’s candidature for the imamship if the occasion arose: but the tribe as a whole has no rroat influence. They are said to have received a joint present of Rs, 2,500/- from the Sultan when they visited him in 1948. EL HO WA S I Mil . The capital of the liowasinah tribe is at El Ghaizain thirty miles west of Khaburah on the Batinah. They are also found in bin- settlements in and around Khaburah in the Wadi Howasinah, as the name implies. Their population is about throe thousand and they have ^ood rifles, not exceedinp a thousand. They are normally peaceful, but are old enemies of the Beni Omar, and more recently of the Awamir. They are formidable fighters, and. a fracas in which they were involved with the Awamir in February 1950 near Khaburah and Sib, was only prevented from serious development by the prompt intervention of Saiyid Lajid, the Sultan’s brother and Wall of Masna’ah. Also their Tamimah, Shaikh Sultan bin Saif and Shaikh Mohammad bin Mur, who have a ''-cod hold over them. They appear to be solidly with the Sultan, and are friendly towards Britishers. Their chief pursuits are cultivation, waevin^ and trade with Sharjah and Dubai. Sultan bin Saif visited the Sultan in 1948 and a^ain in December 1949. He received Rs. 500/- on the former rccasion and Rs. 375/- on the latter. Shaikh Mohammad bin Mur has not visited the Sultan, Shaikh Sultan lives at Khaburah and lias the contract for collection of government 'brokerage” dues in this place, which ho '&lt;■ pora tes throuoh an aront. EL IBRIYTN (or ABRIYIN) . The present population of the Ibriyin is about two thousand, and their rifles may amount to half that number. Their largest settlement is at El Hamra in Oman proper, but they are also to be found in Dhahirah and Western Hajar. Normally peaceful, they are, however, at feud with the Beni Ghafir. They are a fairly intelli gent people, mostly onrayed in camel rearing and drivinr, but some arc traders of quite considerable means. Their Tamimah was formerly All bin Mohammad bin Hamad al Abri, but on account of his laziness, the Imam, under whose sway this tribe comes, appointed his brother Hamad in 1948. The latter is educated, by tribal standards, and clover. He was offered the pest of Qadhi at Muscat by the Sultan, but refused for reasons which have not been divulyed. Ho is about fifty and lives at el Hanra and visited the Sultan in 1948 when he received a present of Rs. 750/-. The tribe maintains friendly relations with the Sultan, and is well disposed to the British. It will, however, probably always support the Imam, and a successor independent of the Sultan. BENI JABIR . The Beni Jabir live in the Wadi to which they rive their name. Their capital is a villa rc in the Wadi called El Gaila. Other settlements are at Kil and Saima. If their population was ever so rroat as claimed by Miles and Lorimer, they must have become much depleted through cholera and plague and mieration in recent years, for nowhere can it be learnt that their numbers exceed three thousand of their rifles one thousand. The people arc said to be normally peaceful and intelligent especially in reli-ious matters. They are at feud with the Beni Ruwahah and, as Ghafiris, allied to Suleiman bin Hamyar. Their own Tamimah is Mohammad bin Rashid bin Harith, arod about fifty-five, livinr in El Gaila. . He visited the Sultan in 1948 and received about Rs . 500/- .The tribe is occupied in date cultivation and in rearing and driving donkeys# Some arc traders# They maintain a friendly attitude to the Sultan and the British. EL JANABAH. The trihe may he divided hy location into three parts# (i) around Adam (Sharqiyah), about four hundred, mainly bedouins, wild and robbers, engaged in camel driving. (ii) around Sur, about eight thousand. These are civilised and, of recent years, peaceable. Formerly they indulged in piracy and slaving, and occasionally slaves have escaped and presented themselves for manumission at the Consulate at Muscat, the last in July 1950. Many of these ’’Suris*’ own dhows, and at present they have about one hundred and fifty engaged in trade between Africa,Zanzibar and the Persian Gulf as far as Basra. Their craft is built locally and is known as a 'sambulc', somewhat smaller than the ♦Kuwaiti 'boom'. (iii) Masirah, about six hundred, migratory and engaged mainly in fishing, but these and other detachments on the Jala’an coast and towards Dhofar, are known to be both robbers and wreckers. The total of the tribe is about ten thousand and they must own about two thousand five hundred rifles, those of the Suris being of the best quality. They areat feud with the Beni bu Hassan and allied to the Hishm, Bani bu Ali and Bani Rasib. Their Tamimah, Yasir bin Hamud al Maj’ali, aged about fifty, lives at Iz. He visited the Sultan in 1948 qnd in December 1949, receiving about Rs. 250/- on each occasion. He is himself well off, with some good date gardens. Apart from their thieving tendencies, their attitude is friendly, though the Sultan appears to have little control over them. BENI KA^AB The Beni Ka’ab are found settled mostly in the Mahadhah tract to the east of the Jau (Buraimi) area. They are also found in the Wadis Al Quor and Hatta, and in Sohar and Liwa. Their chief Shaikh is Obaid bin Juma bin Duiain, and he -receives small allowances from the Sultan through ihe Wall of Snh^r The tribe is friendly to the Sultan and Obaid bin Juma accompanied hisMinister for ?he Interior back from B^aimi in 1948 in connection with oil company negotiations, and visited the Sultan in Muscat. BENI KITTAB (or Qitab) The Beni Qitab (as the name is best transliterated)are divided into two main sections. The larger section live around Dh^id in Sharjah territory with Shaikh Mohammad bin All bin Huwaidin as Their Chief, and it is understood that he gets an annual allowance of some Rs.25,000 from the Ruler. The other section, which seems to have -become completely agr le4 TiS ISaSf t Si r AS P Mn 1 Ra«Jy«h; the Sultan's Mnlstnr Ion th. Interior tact to T'/hn oMuscat in 1948 to visit the Sultan when the Minister was touring the Buraimi neighbourhood in connection with certain oil company negotiations, he gets no allowances from the Sultan, and is not on any close terms with him. On the contrary his people seem to regard themselves as in allegiance with the Imam, and frequently visit his Wali at Ibri (in Dhahirah), from whom the Shaikh is said to draw an allowance. Two other Shaikhs named Fazil bin Rabaiyah and Amir bin Salih Walid al Matawa belong to this tribe. The latter was involved in a recent attempt to kidnap two women from Saltanate territory for slavery but was compelled by the Imam, who sent a force of about four hundred men, to release them and plead forgiveness. This incident affords evidence of there being at least some measure of co-operation between the Sultan and the Imam, The tribe is partly bedouin,and some are found in Jau (Buraimi), EL KATHIR The Kathir is the principal tribe of Dhofar District, in which the Sultan maintains his summer retreat or capital at Salalah. They also live in the Samhan hills behind the Dhofar plain. They number about five thousand, and possess about fifteen hundred rifles. The Sultan has prohibited^for many years now the importation of new rifles into this district, so that those that exist must be getting very old indeed. These people also carry daggers and possess swords, and there may be quite two thousand of each, A few of the tribe are found in Muscat. Those in the plains are cultivators and own excellent gardens of dates, grain and vegetables. Water is good and plentiful, whilst the country gets the South West Monsoon rains, and cattle thrive in the hills. In olden days a flourishing industry was derived from the collection of frankincense from the sap of the shrub which abounds ^on the plateau above the hills. The mother of Qabus, the Sultan s ten year old and only son, comes from this tribe. The tribe is divided into baits (houses) each with its Shaikhs and details have been supplied by one of the Shaikhs as under: - Place Population Rifles Bait Shaikh Salalah 2,500 500 Rawwas Omar bin (Tamimah Mansur and of the Abdul Aziz whole bin Ahmed. tribe). El Hafah 500 80 Shanafirah Ahmed bin Bakhit Dhaharij 200 - Hadhar Saif bin Jahnoon Salalah 300 50 El Marhun Said bin Salim Na qd 1 ( 500 500 Kathir Salim Tamtain They all belong to the Hinawi political faction but are too distant to enter into Oman politics. The Sultan seems to get on well with them, and their attitude is friendly to the British, though shy and cautious on first approach. BENI KHARUSBENI KHARUS. The Beni Kharus is a peaceful and comparatively civilised trihe in the centre of Oman proper, settled mainly at Rostak, Nakhl and Awahi, the capital. The tribe supplied_ the present Imam’s predecessor, and, on his assassination in 1920, his three sons Yahya, Abdulla and Yakub, then aged about ten, eight and six, v/ere taken charge of and have been brought up by the present Imam ever since. Yahya, who is Tamimah of the Beni Kharus has been appointed Wall of Samail by the Imam, and his brother, Abdulla Wall of Nakhl. It is reported from many quarters that, in 1948 when he was undergoing a very severe attack of dysentery, the Imam summoned a majlis of all the Omani Shaikhs and nominated Abdulla as his successor, and got them all to sign a document that they would vote for him . on his demise. It is believed in these quarters that the majority of the tribes are still of the same mind, and that the Sultan has little hope of b-eing elected. Apart from anything else the Omani tribes are exceedingly independent minded, and the treaty of Sib in 1920 established in their view their complete independence of the Sultan, and it seems unlikely that they will readily forego this by voting him in as their Imam, or by agreeing to any measure which will restore the Sultan’s jurisdiction. In 191-8 when many other Shaikhs visited the Sultan, one old Shaikh of this tribe, Khalfan bin Othman, another close friend of Ahmed bin Ibrahim, the Minister for Interior, came to Muscat, but Yahya did not come, and neither he nor his brothers have ever visited Muscat or met the Sultan. The tribe as a whole is not numerous and its members are employed mostly in tending camels and in cultivation, EL NA’IM (including A1 Bu Shamis). The Naim tribe was formerly the most numerous and oowerful tribe of the central portion of the Oman promontory partly nomadic and partly settled in both Trucial and uultcinate Oman. A branch of the tribe also migrated to Bahrain and Qatar generations ago. The Na’irn are divided into two main sub-divisions, A1 bu Kharaiban and A1 bu Shamis. For years the tribe has been torn by internal dissension and both their influence and population are now much depleted. The total strength of the bedouin and settled^portion of the tribe in Sultanate Oman, that is in Dhahirah district and the somewhat disputed Jau tract in which the Buraimi Oasis lies, and which Is regarded by the Na’im as their headquarters, might be about five thousand, mustering perhaps two thousand rifles; but they could never be regarded as one force,. Settled in undisputed Sultanate territory are perhaps two thousand, with about eight hundred rifles. Of these the A1 bu Shamis division has altogether broken iway from the Naim and may for all practical purposes be regarded as a separate tribe, with their hea ?- c l u ^ r ^ G ^ B , also rq 1 ? L . the Buraimi area. A bedouin section under Shaikh Mohammad bin Salmin bin Rahmah lives around Sanainah and Qabil, south ol Bura imiBuraimi. A settled portion, - al Shamio lives in Hamaeah near section, who unlike the others, Dhank (Dhahirah district) under Azizi. under Shaikh Rashid 'bin Hamad Buraimi, whilst another are Hinawis, is settled around Shaikh Matar 'bin Salim al The 'bedouin section of the Al bu Shamis could muster about four hundred rifles; the other section are negligible. Their total population may be one thousand. The Sultan claims influence over the Al bu Shatnis and has stated that he pays them annual allowances and fines them for disturbances or disorders occurring in their territory. There is i o evidence of either payments or fines in recent years, and it is doubtful if in fact the Sultan or Imam of Oman exercise any control, and the tribe is virtually independent, though at least portions are settled in undisputed Sultanate territory (i.e. Dhank). Shaikh Mohammad bin Salmin bin Rahmah is believed to have visited the Sultan in 1918 and to have offered to place himself and his followers at his disposal for Rs, 85,000/- (M.T. Dollars 10,000). The Sultan seems to have been unimpressed and to have sent him away with a present of M.T. Dollars 500/- (Rupees 1,250). Y’ith regard to the rest of the Na’im in Sultanate Oman, that is the settled portion of the Al bu Khuraiban division, the principal shaikh appears to be Saqr bin Sultan al Hamud. His influence is weak, and does not approach that of his father. He lives, it is said, in fear of the Shaikhs Humaid bin Rashid of the bedouin section and Rashid bin Hamaid of Ajman (Trucial coast). In 1948, however, the Sultan claims to have got the Na’im through the offices of his Minister for the Interior, Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim, to accept Shaikh Saqr as their Tamimah and to have signed a document to that effect. More recently though, because Shaikh Saqr started to take an independent line in negotiat ; ons with the Oil Company prospecting in the Buraimi area, the Sultan has not been giving his support to this arrangement, and Shaikh Saqr’s influence is again on the decline, so that in due course, the Sultan hopes, he will have to appeal again to the Sultan; always provided the oil people make no further direct approach. Other sections of the Na’im in Sultanate territory live around Dhank and Hatif in both the plains and hills. The Na’im are on bad terms with the Al bu Palah of Trucial Oman and the Sultanate settlements of the Beni Ka’ab, Beni Qitab and with their sub-division, the Al bu Shamis.. Not counting the Al bu Shamis, they could probably not raise more than three or four hundred rifles, even il the various sub-sections could unite. In the past there was Saudi influence which may again be reviving, and the Na’im, including the Al bu Shamis, xollow the Y'ahabi religion. The Al bu Shamis aro on good terms with the Al bu Palah, Duru and Beni Qitab. The area all around Buraini is uncontrolled, and any foreigners visiting it would require military protection and careful previous arrangements through official channels. \A considerable traffic in slaves is still reported to be carried on, and the fort at Hamasah in Al bu Shamis (and Sultanate) territory is believed to be the main clearing house. / qara ....* PARA . The Qara tribe which lives in the hills of Dhofar district is primitive and uncivilised. The iconic do not look like Arabs, and are probably a branch of the Mahras from the.Hadramaut (Aden Protectorate). They belong, however, to the Ghafiri faction, but do not appear to take any part in politics or to be at feud v/ith the neighbouring Kathir tribe which is Hinawi. Except for a few who live in Salalah and Marbat, they keep to the hills, and dwell in caves. They rear camels, cattle, sheep and goats, and seem to come to the plains to purchase, in exchange for hides and ghee, such grain and vegetables as they need. Though regarded as unreliable, they appear to be peaceable enough at the present time. A fuller account is to be found in Lorimer’s Gazetteer from which there has been little change. Their baits and other particulars as supplied by a S haikh are as under:- Bait Settlement Shaikh Population Rifles Re: El Ma'a Taqa and Salim bin Mahad 1,500 1,000 shani hills Jabub Samhan Hamad al Secdan 200 40 - hills Ali bin Samhan Ahmed bin Ali and 300 100 Taman hills Al Bakhit bin Hassa n Qatan and -do- Musa11am bin Said 300 100 Said and Said bin Tammam Aka 'k Rekhut and (or Raikhut) Awaz bin Mahad 250 50 Ha r dan and hills They • appear to know tho Sultan well by s ight and address him simply and directly as M S aid”, without title or honorific , a practi which the : Sultan likes. They seem friendly to Europeans , but have all the suspicion and shyness of a wild people, and require careful approach. BENI RIY/i.i The Beni Riyam is the largest tribe in Oman, the population now exceeding perhaps fifteen thousand. As a whole they are civilised and peaceably inclined, and have few rifles, possibly loss than a thousand. In comparison with others their intelligence is high. They live mainly in the mountain region of the Jobal Akhdar, where they have over fifty villages. V’ith good water supplies and pasture lands, they aro able to keep cattle, and consume a wine made from grapes which they grow. Though their Tamimah, Suleiman bin Hamyar, who is also Taminah of all the Ghafiris, is, like Salih bin Isa, tho Hinawi leader, close to the Imam, the tribe itself is at feud with the Euwahah (the Imam’s tribe). Shaikh Suleiman and his eldest son and heir, Sultan, visited the Sultan at Muscat in 1948. There he received the greatest hospitality, during which his daily expenditure is understood to have cost the Sultan Rs. 200/- for the fortyfive days of his stay. On leaving the Sultan is supposed to have given him M.T. Dollars 50,000 (Rs. 1,25,000), five American Rifles, ammunition, ten bags of rice, five bags of sugar and a Jeep. This last the Shaikh, who drives, took to his home Tanuf via the Batinah, Nadi Dhank Yanqul and Ibri. He built a road to Muti intending to join up with the ’‘ f adi Samail, making a short route to Muscat, but was prevented by the Imam and people of that territory.As tho head of one of the larger Hinnui tribes himself, the Sultan probably considers Salih bin Isa al Harthi less important to placate, as, though he came in for considerable favours too, they were not upon this scale, and it is clear from his extra lavish treatment of the Ghafiri leader the irrrportance which the Sultan attaches to his position, and his anxiety to get his support in the election for Imam ship v/hich will follow the decease of the present incumbent. *.7hich way Shaikh Suleiman, who is himself about forty, will go is any one’s guess: at present his outward attitude, whilst friendly to the Sultan, is allegiance to the Imam, The Beni Riyam are on good torms with the other Ghafiri tribes of Oman, and their attitude to the British would probably be friendly, though they have not come much in contact with them. Shaikh Suleiman himself gets about, and is friendly with the American missionaries. BENI RIT.7AHAH. The tribe is mainly located in Ha jar in the upper part of the 7adi Samil called the Wadi Beni Ruwahah. They arc however divided into two main factions which are opposed to one another. These are described by location on the 7 adi Beni Ruwahah, El Sharqi (East) under Shaikh Salih bin Harib numbering about twelve hundred, and El Gharbi (dost) under Shaikh Saif bin Ahmed bin Hamid, numbering about two thousand. The latter are against the Imam of Oman for reasons which are obscure, though ho is the accepted Tamimah of the whole tribe. Other settlements of the tribe are to be found in Samail, Izki, Nizwa, Boshar and even Zanzibar. The total_population may reach eight thousand or even more, and their rifles two thousand. The people are mainly cultivators and donkey drivers. About forty are employed as Askaris in Matrah. The tribe is at feud with the Beni Riyam and Beni Jabir. Both Shaikhs visited the Sultan in 197-8 and received presents of about Rs. 500/- each. The Imam, Mohammad bin Abdullah al Khalili, as tribal loader appears to have little to do with his tribe. ns elected Imam of Oman since 1920 he has considerable spiritual power over the tribes as a whole. His temporal newer is shared, more or less equally, with the leaders of the Ghafiri and Hinawi factions, and together these three exercise a fairly effective independent control over the interior of Oman proper, where the Imam appoints his own 7alis. He lives at Nizwa, insists upon a strictly puritanical way of life, and. is opposed to all progress such a.s oil development and motor transport, and to penetration by jiuropeano (and probably Americans) especially Christians, though the Miosionary doctors have been called to him in sickness. He has brought up the three sons of the late Imam, Yahya, Abdulla and Ydieub and in some quarters it is held that, in 1973, when suffering from dysentery he nominated tho second son as his successor, and that this has the support of many of the tribes. Other quarters insist that he has refused to make a nomination, in spite of entreaty by various other leaders in 19^-7. WhicheverWhichever is true, as has been shov/n in these notes, the Sultan appears to have encouraged all the* loaders to visit him at Muscat in 1948. Ho has also tightened up on religious observances and retarded many possible developments since; oil in particular, and has endeavoured to build up a reputation for religious orthodoxy. In the meantime (duly 1950) the Imam is reported to be in excellent health and to be looking much younger than his 72 years. Khalil with which he completes his name is a sub section of the Ruwal a# YAh SA t AD The Yal Sa’ad are reckoned as numerically the second largest tribe in Oman. They live in an almost solid block around el Khadra and Suv/aik on the Batinah coast, with their capital somewhat inland at El Batha. Their other big villages are Mladdah, Tharmad and Bu Abali. The present population is about ten thousand and they may possess as many as six thousand rifles. Some are Bedouins, wild and warlike, and some are said to be famous for slaving, and still to engage in kidnapping from Mekran and Africa. For the most part they are settled and own extensive date gardens, and peaceably inclined. Many are wealthy and engage in trade with Africa and India. Their Tamimah is a comparatively young man of about thirty living at el Batha, named Hamad bin Hilal bin Hamad. He succeeded his father about three years ago- Another Shaikh of the sub-section Yal bu Rashaid, named Khalid bin Salim bin Khalid lives at el Khadra. Shaikh Hamad visited the Sultan in 1940, and received Rs. 2,000/-. The tribal attitude to the Sultan and British is good. They appear to have no special enemies and have not been at war with any other tribe for the last thirty years; nor have they any named allies. AL BU SAID This is the tribe of the Sultans of Muscat and Oman. The present Sultan is head of it and their Tamimah. The people are scattered and number about two thousand, with about four hundred rifles outside the Sultan's military and personal resources. Most of them are poor and employed in cultivation. Some are goldsmiths, especially in Nizwa and Manah. The tribal capital is Adam and small settlements are found in Manah, Nizwa, Izki, Samail, Sohar, Sib, Boshar, Muttrah and, of course, the Sultan's relations in Muscat. About three hundred are settled in Zanzibar as cultivators, and some as traders. The Sultan appears to have appointed many Walis from this tribe. They are allied with the Janabah and Dura and do not appear to be at feud with any tribe. The title 'Saiyid' is officially reserved to the Sultan and his close relatives, though many use it. SHARA This is the oldest tribe of the three tribes in Dhofar District, and may be aboriginal. The people speak a dialect called Kazrat (so named by the Arabs from its 'sizzling' sound). The people are completely primitive and wear few clothes, living, except for a few in Salalah, exclusively in caves in the Samhan hills. They have a reputation for thieving and treachery, but at present seem to be living quietly enough.

Jhey used to be at feud with the Dhahuriyin, but thia tribe is even more primLtLvo and now nearly extinct. It is composed almost entirely of fishermen, who migrate wholesale from their villages to cooler places in the summer# There is no recognised Tamimah*.but the most important Shaikh of the Beni Shatair sub section of the Shihuh is Hassan bin Rahmah, aged about forty- 11 voj. living at Bai ah near Dibah on the border north of Shamaillyah# He visited the Sultan in 1948 and received Rs#500/-# Another man of some importance is tho Shaikh of the Beni Hiddayah sub-section of the tribe called Mohammad bin Ahmed, living in Bakhiah, south of Khasab. He also visited the Sultan in 1948 and is understood to have received Rs. 500/-. He is constantly at feud with the Q'owasim of Has al Khaimah on his border, and both in this.and similar chronic feuds between the Shihuh and Qowasim of Dibbah, on the other side of the promontory, His Majesty s Govcrnmont have upon occasions had to intervene to keep the peace. As a whole the Shihuhare wild, surly and unattractive.people, living in most primitive conditions, and are shy and suspicious of strangers. At Khasab the Sultan exercises some control through a Kali, but in the mountain regions of the interior and the inaccessible coastal villages, control or administration is non-existent. A peculiar, wild, completely isolated and unfriendly section,Imown as the Kumzaris, lives at Kumzar near the most northerly point of the promontory. They too have their own dialect# Their Shaikh is Salih bin Mohammad. / As... * The Shaikh ofKhassab in 1930 defied the Sultan and refused to allow H.M.S, Ormonde to land survey parties. H.M.S.

The Rupee, and not the M.T. Dollar, is the currency in this district# YAL WAHIBRH The Wahibah is an important tribe found mainly in the Sharplyah and Jala*an districts. It probably numbers five thousand and is well armed with perhaps two thousand rifles. The headquarters seem to be at Sadair.ah, and Muahaibi# The tribe is mostly bedouin, though settlements exist at the two places named and at Boshar and Muscat, and in the Batinah, They are poor, brave and warlike/ Their Tamimah is Humud bin Sultan bin Mansur and another leading Shaikh is named Humud bin Saif. The former visited the Sultan in 191-8 and received Rs. 500/-c Their attitude to the Sultan and British is good but they support the Imam and are unlikely to vote for the Sultan as successor. They are at feud with the Janabnh and Duru. The tribe’s name should not be confused with the Wahabi religion. The people are, in fact, Ibadhis, and belong to the Hinawi political faction. SUR A list of the Shaikhs and important persons of Sur, which is the next town in importance after Matrah and Muscat, and often visited by H.M.’s ships and British officials, is given below, with the names of the tribal sections to which they belong, as supplied by one of the Shaikhs. They have for long been at variance with the Sultans and evaded taxation. They respect the British for the power with which they aro able to back the Sultan, and in spite of this running contrary to their interests they are friendly and good hosts, at least to official visitors. They all belong to the Janabah tribe and head the sections named, Al Aramah:- This is the largest section and the Shaikhs axe:*- (i) Nasir bin Mohammad Walad Pana fii) Abdulla bin Rashid Walad Pana (iii) Mohammad bin Nasir al Hashar (not actually a Shaikh).

The Imam. The rules for the appointment of Imam are as follows 1. He is elected hy the Mullas and Tribal Leaders* 2. He must be a man of good bearing and reputation of a pious disposition and well versed in religious matters. 3. He should not be from a large tribe which is able to exercise its influence beyond its own tribal borders. 4. He is elected only after the decease of his predecessor. Shaikhs There is no special election of Shaikhs, and tribal leadership usually falls to the son or brother * o-r other nearest male relative, depending to some extent upon accoptance by the tribe as a whole'. Extent of the Administration. The Imara*s influence extends over the territ ories of the tribes which support•him. Broadly defined this is from the southern border of Dhahirah province, in the north west of the Sultanate, along the mountainous ridge of Western and Eastern Ha jar*, almost to the coast in Sharqiyah and Jala* an, bounded on the South by the Hub el Kh^li desert and on the North by the territories of the tribes which support the Sultan. The Capital and residence 6f the Imam is NIZWA. The tribes at present supporting the Imam are:«» Beni Ghafir Beni Habus el Hadadabah Beni Hadrami -Bchi Hajriyin Beni Harras el Harth Beni bu Hassan .Beni Hinah el Ibriyin Beni Jabir Beni Kharus el Kinud el Ma'awal Beni Mahariq el Masakrah el Masharifah Beni Nabhan el Nadahiyan Rabbi yarn Beni Ruwahah Beni Shakail el Siyabiyin Yal Wahibah el Ya’aqib el Ya f aribah el Yaman Further particulars regarding these tribes will be found in the 'Notes on the Tribes of the Sultanate of Muscat &amp; Oman. 11 The Administration./ H u .,ll, h Endowment Mostly to finan f ! ® nr.np&gt;r» ~^n^r 111 ^f 3 by persoti^ their yill^. These revenues and tax^- c are collected by tae officials appointed by the &gt; ,ani anc3 are intended to go to the central Treasu&gt;tf» There are however tna*ty defalcations and re'Cv^als to pay ; and the Imam has made several fr 1 -.^ i-i-css attoupts to appoint a Revenue Inspector to check the accounts of the Walls and other officials, but no one is willing to take the post, or if takes it, is able to deal with the more influential people. Fortunately the Imam is himself possessed of considerable properties from which he derives adequate revenues, and many of the Walls arc expected to carry on their administration and remunerate themselves and their officials from the revenues to be collected in their districts. (d) Security.Law &amp; Order t /rms &amp; Bquipmenr . Shara law governs everything, and all offences and disputes arising out of transactions of any nature are settled by the Qadhis in accordance with it. Besides the Koran there are several works in Arabic dealing with the Law, and the Qadhis and people generally have a good knowledge of it, and it is seldom abused. Nearly every tribesman of the interior possesses and can handle arms of some sort. They are A/ taud^r^ quick to unite to resist uni or interference in ()/ their affairs. They resent and are highly suspicious of intrusion, by foreigners, and can be expected to offer opposition to any’ attempt to exploit the natural resources of their country, as they believe that this will result only in a lessening of' + hoir independence and little materia? benefit, financial or otherwise, to themselves. The Imam maintains no standing Army, but employs about two thousand Askars posted as village policemond garrisons of the forts throughout his territory to assist the Walis and Qadhis in their duties and for their protection, and, of course, his own. The pay of an Askari is about 4 Rials a month, and that of a Head Askari about 10 Rials. 'Hinawi^ Askars must serve in Hinawi territory, and'’Ghafaria 1 ' in Ghafari territory. A fairly plentiful supply of old fashioned rifles exist (ranging from muzzle 3 oarers to single breach loading .450 Martini He r '-whilst ‘‘a few tribesmen seem to have aegui'^d some quite modern weapons (.303 magazine Lee Enfields). Those that cannot obtain fresh ammunition, make their own cur h fr om fired cases,scrap and a locally made powder. With the supression of the former traffic in arms and ammunition, the Sultan, who can imports his requirements from the United Kingdom, has a considerable inducement to offer those who might otherwise not wish to seek his favour. Some of the old cannon in the forts may be capable of use. Swords and daggers comp Tele their armament. (e) Medi ca lor -4 (e) Medical . There is-up provision for medicine, midwifery etc:. The nearest hospitals or medical aid are in Muscat, Matrah and Dubai, The American Mission doctor at Matrah is sometimes invited to visit the interior. (**) Education . The only schools are those main tained in mosques by the Mullahs for imparting the teachings of the Koran to children, and small build ings in gardens maintained from charitable endowments which teach Arabic grammar and the Shara law, in addition. The teachers are paid from these funds. (g) General . The Imam makes no attempt to issue passports for foreign travel,and all Omanis, except one or two recalcitrants such as Sulaiman bin Hamyar of the Jebal Akhdar region, who is trying for complete independence, obtain Omani passports signed by the Sultan. The Sultanate and Imam , s courts appear to find no difficulty in working in co-operation in such matters as the administration and disposal of the estates of deceased persons, and joint action is sometimes taken in matter of public security and mutual defence. The present Sultan seems also to be in much closer touch with the Imam ovor their foreign relatione than many people may think. He also appears to have complete confidence in his interpretation of the feelings of the Shaikhs of the In^^ferior, many of whom regularly visit him, and the Imam’s support in his dealings with foreign interests. Such dealings the Imam seems content to leave to the Sultan, whilst the latter makes no attempt to interfere v/ith the former. In other words they both seem to be implement ing the Treaty of Sib of 1920, perhaps even more in the spirit than in the letter, and the tribes, them selves, have enjoyed a period of peace since that date, unrivalled in their history. A short prdcis of the history of the events leading up to the separation of the two administrations the establishment of a separate Imam, and their reconciliation by the Treaty of Sib is attached.Brief narrative oi events to show ' liow the office of Imam of Oman ceased to he vested in the person of the Ruler of Muscat &amp; Oman and the relat ions existing between them at the present 1 kime (1950 Until 1793 the Rulers of Muscat and Oman were elected, and their capital v/as maintained at Rostaq in the interior until 1783. Thereafter it was transferred to the coaot at Muscat, as a result of which much of the control over the tribes of the interior was lost. Following the usurpation of power by Saiyid Sultan in 1793, and abandonment of the formality •. of election of the rulers thereafter, the tribes of the interior began to regard the Rulers as usurpers, and a series of rebellions took place between 1829 and 1867, cul minating in seizure of power by a junior branch of the ruling family, supported by some of the tribes. He was however overthrown in 1871, by the legitimate branch. Thereafter numerous attempts to dislodge the Sultans were made by the Omani tribes, whose feelings v/ere further incensed by the stoppage of the arms and the slave traffic, both of which are permitted by Islam, at the instigation of the Christian Pov/ers. These culminated in a carefully organised rebellion in 1913 . In fulfilment of a guarantee given to the Sultan in 1895, which was also communicated to the Shaikhs of Oman, British military assistance was provided and a crushing defeat was inflicted upon the tribal forces which in January 1915 attacked the British outposts at Bait al Falaj, stationed there for the protection of Muscat. By 1918, however, the rebel tribes had obtained complete control of the interior, known as Oman proper, and had established a government in it under their own Imam. They would undoubtedly have taken Muscat and all the coastal towns had it not been for the Military and Naval assistance which the British Government were ready to afford, and also financial and other assistance supplied to restore and improve the Administration. only In the en&lt;^/fctfter several a'V'omp_to, by the British Political authorities to effect a reconcil iation, and after a further demonstration of force and economic pressure and the murder of the Imam by his tribes, was the Political Agent of the time able to promote further negotiations which, on the 25 th September 1920 ^terminated in the signing of an agreement known since as the Treaty of Sib, Under the terms of this agreement the Sultan undertook not to interfere in the internal affairs of the tribes j not to impose more than 5% taxation on their produce brought into the coastal towns; to allow member a of' the tribes to come oud r;o freely end to return fugitive criminals. In return the tribes agreed to remain in peace and friendship with the Sultan, not to interfere with his government or to attack the coastal towns; not to impose any restrictions on trade; to permit travellers to pass freely; to turn out fugitive criminals and bo dispose of all claims in accordance with the Shara law.r V yg^^ALJ^gPOINTED Place or Piatrlot gang of Wall Remarks Adam el AwaM BAHLA Bidbid Bidiyyah Horara Ibrl iski Ibrahim eldest on behalf of his father son of Mohammed who is actually the Wall bin Salim el of Ibri,Adam and Izki.

Amendments to the Notes on the Tribes of Muscat &amp; Otni&gt;« In Notes at page 0 aft&amp;p note on Beni Karras -add HARASIS The Harasis are a dwindling trihe of doubtful origin seldom encountered except in Dhofar f and in the neighbourhood of Wadi al Haqf of oil interest, where, as Bedouins, they move about in small encampments to the borders of the Janabah country on the mainland West of Masirah. They have their own dialect but know Arabic.Normally friendly to foreigners they recognise the Sultan and visit him in Dhofar. They are, however,difficult to deal with as although now a small tribe of poss ibly no more than a fev/ hundred males, they have several petty Shaikhs. Their Chief* though only nominally so,appears to be Sharqi bin Akas of the Bait Aksit. Other baits or sections are Mutaira, Sha # ia f Qadhran, Afari, and Barhauh. In Notes after the note on EL Janabah at page 10 inoart BENI KA*AB The Beni Ka’ab are found settled most ly in the Mahadhah tract to the east of the Jau (Buraimi) area. They are also found in the Wadis al Qor and Hatta, and in Sohar and Liwa. Their 6 hief Shaikh is Obaid bin Juma bin Duiain, andhe receives small allowances from the Sultan through the Wali of Sohar. The tribe is friendly tothe Sultan and Obaid bin Juma accompanied his Minister for the Interior back from Buraimi in 194$ in connection with oil company negotiations, and visited the Sultan in Muscat. BENI KITTAB (or Qitab) The Beni Qitab (as the name is best transliterated) are divided into two main sections. The larger section live around DHAID in Sharjah territory with Shaikh Mohammad bin Ali bin Huwaidin as their Chief, and it is understood that he gets an annual allowance of some R 3 25,000 from the Ruler. The other section, which seems to have become completely separated live in DHAHIRAIi, with their cauital at Aflaj Beni Qitab. Their Shaikh is Mohammad bin Ali bin Rabaiyah. Though he accompanied the Sultan’s Minister for the In +o rior back to M ' , '»s~ut in 1948 to visit the Sultan when the touring the Buraimi neighbourhood in certain oil company negotiations, he ances from the Sultan, and is not on with him.

The latter was involved in a recent attempt to kidnap two women from Sultanate territory for slavery but was compelled by the Imam, who sent a force of about four hundred men, to release them and plead f :&gt;rgiva» ness.

Felly will no doubt let you know when he has received these whether he has anything to add to my note. R.M. Saner, jisq., 0. .ni., Eastern Department, Foreign Office, S.*..1. (V/.R. Hay)Copy of Note recorded by Sir Rupert Hay, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain, on Research Department Paper of the 6 th December, 1950 entitled 'Tribes of Muscat &amp; CHian 1 . niixti uju 2« Prom the election of Said Ahmad in 1 until 1?83 the Sultans were themselves Imams and from that date until 1912 when the tribes elected an Imam from outside the Al Bu Said dynasty there was no effective Imam. During the whole of this period successive Sultans controlled all oi the territory which we now claim for the Sultanate on and off sudjgcc to fre quent rebellions and invasions. Paragraph 5. I do not think there is any xringe of 'independent' tribes between the Imam end the Ruba al Khali. The Harasis, the most westerly of the Onan tribes, acimowledge the Imam and the Qara and other Dhofari tribes are definitely subject to the Sultan. Tribes beyond these are Saudi. There must be a very large aree which is completely uninhabited and perhaps not included in any tribal dirah though this requires verification. With regard to the parenthesis at the end of paragraph 5, the loose use^of the term Buraimi causes some confusion as it is applied without distinction to the whole of the oasis and one specific village. There are seven villages in the oasis of which five belong to Abu Dhabi and two, including Buraimi itself, form part of what we claim as Sultanate territory. I have not heard that the Sultan disputes Abu Dhabi s rights in the five villages which are subject to it. Paragraph 6 . I think the Imam’s reluctance to admit any form of modernisation is a more or less complete sareguard ior so long as he lives. The Sultan recently told me that Sulaiman bin Himyar if deprived of the Imam s support coaid exercise very little influence. The position as I see it is that all the tribes in Sultanate clearly acknowledge the authority of ® ither . t J 1 . e , or the Imam with the exception of those in the Jau and Mahadhah districts. The Sultan has recently claimed, I think correctly, that the Imam recognises his authority in external affairs. Chauncy has recently written ... 'My own impression is that the Sultan and the Imam are at present closer than people tiiinx and together they wield a fairly extensive influence ov ®f territories in question, and the ranks will close still further to resist Saudi claims'. My own view is that the only trioes who might be persuaded to submit to Saudi authority are those in the Jau tract. paragraph 7 . I agree generally. Their shaikhs Paragraph 8. The Karasis should be added, visit the Sultanfrom time to time in Dhofar. I would note that no very great reliance can be placed on visits and presents. Some of the shaikhs concerned have probably also visited Ibn Saud and been given presents. Paragraph 11. Paragraph 14* See the second part of my note on paragraph ? As I have noted, these tribes are our / Achilles’ heel.K/ &amp; - 2 - Achilles' heel. The Sultan has, however, recently, given us copies of documents obtained from them which support his claim that they are his subjects. With regard to the Beni Qitab, I would note that Major Chauncy has recorded no separate note on the Beni Qitab of tne Dhahirah. I think their attitude is probably much the sain- ^ that of the al bu Shamis and the Na'im, but this requires verification. The Beni Qitab inland of Sharjah are subject to the Ruler of that place and receive allowances from him. Paragraph 19 . The list of Badu' tribes is not exhaustive. The Harasis should be included amongst others. Paragraph 21. Major Chauncy meant to report that the Duru* were at feud with the V/ahiba and not with the &lt;ahabis. He has since corrected this error. According to Major Chauncy, however, Thesiger is reported as having said that the Duru were anti—Wahabi and anti—Saudi in a nooe oi conversation recorded by j]astem Department on ohe 12th April, 1 ^y;0. Paragraph 2^ . The Qara are not only well disposed towards the Sultan, but, so far as I am aware, definitely subject to him. Paragraph 25 . Please see again the second part of my note on paragraph 5* We should back the Abu Dhabi claim to their five villages and the Sultan's claim to his two villages, viz. Buraimi and lianasa. Paragraph 26 . I agree generally, but think that we should produce our own definition of the Buraimi area. (Signed) W.R. Hay. 21 st July,BRITISH RESIDENCY, Rlstricted.

In a note to Thesiger f s lecture in the Geographical Journal for December 1950 they are described as follows “Sections of the Harasis are Bait Aksit, Bait Mutaira, Bait Sha’Ia, Beit Qadhran, Bait Afari and Bait Barkauh. Their head shaikh is Sharqi bin Akas of the Bait Aksit. They speak a Semitic language of their own, as do the Mahra, Qarra, Shihra and Bantakara. They have a curious custom of milking their goats on two hot stones placed in the milk bowl and these stones can be seen wherever they have camped. u In the body of the lecture it is stated that they are Hinawi. I am doubtful therefore if these have any connexion with the Beni Harras whom you record as Ghafiri. I think j*e Hias stated somewhere or else told me verbally that their country is under the Irnan^s administration. The Sultan should himself be able to give you information about them as he told me once that their shaikhs visit him from time to time in Dhofar. Prom another note of Major P. C. L.

He descrihes them in an article^ written for the Royal Anthropological Institute s Journal Vol LIX January - June 1929 as follows 'The Harasis are a ana 11, dwindling nomad pastoral trihe, perhaps numbering not more than 200 men, whose hahitat is not regarddd as their own exclusively, hut belongs in name to the Western Janaba tribe in the steppe land bordering the desert and extending from the Wadi Saratyas far Test as the 56th line longitude. (In another article he names the tract they roam as the stony and wateiv'less plain of Jaddaf al Harasis). Although clients of the Janaba they belong to the rival political faction of Hinawi . A tribe of noble traditions they are now a scattered collection of seven sections acknowledging only a nominal hereditary Shaikh.' Thesiger descrihes them as a small trihe of six sections. He names the sections and the head Shaikh Sharqi hin Akas. ^ Miles does not, I think, mention theja^, and Lorimer only as visitors at p 1410 of his Gazetteer Vol II. As my notes are based on their lists, and as I had not then heard of the tribe, I did not include it. Nor would I have done had I known it fu* there are, in fact, several similar omissions from my list, I have stated in my notes, of ■hVinftA tribes, which are too small or have become (2) Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN. His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, K.C. I.E. , C.S. I.(2) I have also not written ony special note of the Beni Qitah and Beni Ka f ah # as their Sultanate portions are small and I have nothing to add / except their estimated present strength a^-d the names of their Shaikhs to Lorimer’s notes, without which mine were never intended to he complete. (3) as regards the influence of Saleh and Suleiman, I can only go hy hearsay. The Sultan seems to attach more importance to them than he admits when it comes to their entertainment, and sending them off with p esents, though he certainly appears to treat Saleh even more generously than Suleiman. In comparison with his treatment of the rest of the Shaikhs, these are the only two which count with the Sultan: hut, of course, he may he more sure of the others anyhow. (4) My remarks about the advisability of obtaining escort by previous arrangement with the authorities, were based on Stobafct heading me off visiting by land route or meeting him in Burairai, owing to a series of incidents which he said had recently occurred and the difficulty of arranging protection, or retaliating if anything happened. We had also had fairly recent instances of kidnapping by raiders based on Buraimi, Liahadhah and ‘Dhahirah. But I agree that with a force led by British officers to police the area, banditry and slavery should dis appear. That was certainly the view of all the people I met on my last tour to Sohar and Khor ^ak an. (5) It was Woods-Ballard who told me that he had formed the idea that the Sultan was content to do without oil, and that, anyhow he hates this oil company. His use of the exoression 'delighted' at their giving up the Dhofar Concession seems to endorse this. He took over a year to come back to the same conclusion about the manner in which a party ^ould prospect in Huqf, and I am certain that he took no steps to enquire or make arrangements. However he did sudd nly show an cnexpected change of front after the first of your rasetings with him on your last visit: and I think he is now trying to interest the Shaikhs in the Oman, Haiar, Dhahirah and Jau districts, and, as far as those who are already interested are concerned, to see how he can unite them under his general control. To this end he has been seeing a great deal of Saif bin Amir of the Beni Ali, who lives at Yankul, and who is sAid to have always been a good friend. (6) &amp; (7) I/regret the spelling mistakes and confusion over the w rd WAHABI. There are two Omaiti tribes, the Yal WAHIBA and the Beni Y/AHAIB, and the WAHABI religion.

Half the trouble is the necessity to rely on hearsay rather than a visit to the spot: though even where I have been able to visit I found the people themselves at variance with one another. The only thing I can say, excent for Lorimer and files, no one else appears to have been able to produce a similar compilation though I see from records you had yourself been pressing for it for years. 2. Incidentally, for the purposes of the Research Department Thesiger says in a note recorded of his visit to the Eastern Department on^.the 12th April 1950 that the Duru are anti—WAHABI (ana'Saudi), so that there should be no need for a revision of Buss’s note in tftis respect due to the typing error in ray note on this tribe.

Chauncy Political Agent Muscat.%COPY Comments on Major Chau.ncy ! s latest edition of his Note on the Tribes of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman. (1) I can find no mention of the Harasis who live in the extreme south-west of Oman beyond the Hucif and are frequently referred to by Thesiger. I do not know if they are identical tribally with the Beni Harras who are described in the note. (2) The Beni Qitab and the Beni Ka*ab are mentioned in the prefatory notes and in the list at the end, but there is no detailed description of them. (3) I think that in the second paragraph of the prefatory notes Major Chauncy may have exaggerated the extent to which the Imam is dependent on his two lieutenants, Saleh and Sulaiman. According to the Sultan, Sulaiman would have little authority outside his own village if deprived of the Imam's backing. (4) In the last paragraph of the detailed note on the ojr Na'im MsPj or Chauncy states the foreigners visiting the area round Buraimi would require military protect ion and that a considerable traffic in slaves is still reported to be carried on there. During recent months British locust officers have been visiting Buraimi and even some of the country to the south of it with out any trouble, and it is also peported that as a result of the arrival of the Trucial Oman Levies in tm Sharjah the traffic in slave’s has virtually ceased. (5) In the last sentence of the detailed note on the Beni Ruwahah it is stated amongst other things that the Sultan has retarded possible development in oil. I think this gives a somewhat wrong impression. He is I believe, most anxious that oil should be developed and all that he has done is to insist that if any exploration is carried out on the southern coast of /ArabiaArabia opposite Masirah adequate protection should be provided. (6) Major Chauncy has asked that the word ,, Wahabis ,, in line 6 of the note on the Daru should be corrected to 'Wahiba'. I think a similar correction is required in line 10 of the note on the Bani Battash and line 6 of the note on the Habus. (7) Some of the spelling requires revision. I presume ’•Whahabi” which appears in two or three places is a typing error. (Sgd.) W. R. HAY 25th June, 1951*I /Iciu /Ci /W* r* Restricted. 15/8/62/51. H. B» M v s Consulate Political Agency, MUSCAT . 22nd, June and , 1951. My dear Le Quesne, Please refer to your letter No. 10111/14 dated the 13th June 1951, on receipt of the enclosure to which I again looked up the papers. 2. I do not think there is much I can usefully add to what I have already written. 3. With regard to the Dhofar tribes, the Kathir, 3hara and Qara. There can surely be no doubt about their recognition of the Sultan. Qabus's mother belongs to the first named and they and the others live in the bgofar hills and in the plains, and market in Salalah and attend the Wall’s court and meet the Sultan on all occasions, whilst he moves freely amongst them and knows many personally. 4. As regards ^douins, I think the Awamir, Beni bu Ali, A Daru, Naim and A1 bu Shamis are the min, if not the only tribes with ^douin sections rDving the borders of the Rub al Khali. The best opinion i can get here does not include the Harasis. I think they are all in alliance with their settled portions in Sultanate territory and themselves have habitations within these territories. I doubt if anyone has control over the bedouins, but the Sultan and Imam between them can certainly exercise a good deal of influence over the settled portions, and I do not see how^theie^ tribes could be classed as inde pendent, however light c ontrol over them may be in practice. 5. The settled Awamir are chiefly to be found in Oman proper and the Muscat District^ The Beni bu All are in Sharqiyah and Jala’an. The Damiuin Dhahirah and the Naira and AmbuShamis partly in Dhahirah but chiefly in Jau (Burairal). 6. Dhahirah ''Province' contains the SI A^iz^orae of Beni All, most of Baru, some Ibriyin, Beni it tab (or Qitab), some Beni Kalb an, some Na’im and Al bu Shamis, the Beni Yamm and the Beni Zld. It is of interest to note that two sons and some nephews of the Shaikh of the Beni Yahya have just called at this Consulate with Sultanate passports for visas, and I have no doubt many other members of these tribes take out Sultanate C.M. Le Quesne Esq, First Secretary, The British Residency, BAHRAIN .■2 out Sultanate passports when tliey travel abroad* Shallch Saleh bin Isa al ^iarthi has a Sultanate passport and travelled to India on it: I do not know about Suleiman bin Hoinyar, but think not. Nearly all the leaders regularly visit the Sultan and receive presents and allowances of sorts from him. 7. Finally the fifahadhali/tract is I think only peopled by the 'eni Ka f ab, some of whom, with some of the ^eni Kittab, and most of the settled Na f im and Al bu Shamis are found in Jau. The Sultan’s influence in Jau has already been fully dealt with by Sir Rupert and the Sultan’s letters from the Shaikhs have been mentioned. The Sultan and the Imam in clqse co-operation recently brougit pressure to bear on the ^bni Kaab in Mahadhah and some of the Dhahirah tribes over kidnapping of women in the 'atinah. The women were recovered and no further instances have occurred. 8. My OvWi impression is that the Sultan and the Iman are at present closer than people think, and togefter they wield fairly extensive influence over the territories in question, and the ranks will close still further to resist Saudi claims. That is why the Sultan is not particularly impressed by reports of the antics of Saqr bin Sultan of the ^a’im and feelers by Sulaiman bin Hamyar: though this is dependent upon our not ensmraging them either. 9. Sir Rupert will also be inte ested to know that since his visit here and talks with the Sultan, Shaikh Saif bin Amir of the ^ni Ali ( Capital Yankul ) near Dhahirah in iVestern Hajar is on a visit to Muscat. He is staying as a guest of the Sultan f and meets him each evening after dark and they break the fast together. It is also reported that this Shaikh is giving the Sultan some twenty to thirty recruits for the Muscat Infantry from his tribe. Yours sincerely Sd/- F.C.L. Chauncy 1IC.10111/14 13th June, 1931. Further to ngr letter 10111/11 asking for your comments on Buss’ memorandum on the tribes of Oman, I enclose a copy of a note recording Sir Rupert’s comments which may be of assistance to you in com piling your own. &lt;(^CORDED BY II.E. THE POLITICAL HE8ICERT ON 5 JNXE, 195l) A +- COb Mr Note 10 in Thesiger’s lecture in the Royal Geographical Society’s Journal for December 1950 reads:- ’’The Ruraimi oasis con sists of the following vill ages: Buraimi, Hamasa, al ’Ain, l uvvaigih, Mataradh, Jimi, Qatara and Hllli. Buraiad village belongs to Saqr bin Sultan, Shaikh of the Na’im and Hanasa to the Shuamis. The other villages are ruled from luwaiqih by Sayid bin Sultan of the Al bu Palah, Shakhbut’s representative”. have we any information about the Shuamis ? _ Other notes make it clear that they are not the s ame as the al bu Shai: ds. west of them is, I believe, virtually uninhabitable though Saudi tribes such as the al lurra visit it. With regard to the parenthesis at the end of this paragraph, the position is that tw6-thirds of ^uraimi is under the more or less effective control of the Ruler of Abu Dhabi whose brother resides there and the remaining one-third is nominally part of the Sultanate of 1 uscat and Oman. I do not know if the Sultan admits Abu Dhabi sovereignty over two-thirds of the oasis and I do not want the matter put to him if it can be avoided. The one- third of the oasis nominally in the Sultanate of ivuscat and Oman is probably occupied by Na’im an^. al bu Shamis. Can this be verified from Jasim’s note ? Paragraph 8. Mr. Pelly has remarked that if we accept the argument that visits by Sul adman and Saleh to the Sultan give good grounds for maintaining that they tacitly owe allegiance to him, Ibn Baud could argue that Qatar belongs to him because the Ruler visits him. ly own view is that we must base our claim on the argument that the whole of Oman which is a dministered internally by the Imam is part of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman because the Sultan claims that the Imam admits this, and it can be regarded as implicit in the Sul tarn’s undertaking in the Treaty of Sib not to interfere with the tribes' internal affairs. We cannot flnfortunately prove that the Imam accepts this position, but I consider it probable that if he were threatened by Ibn Saud he would turn to the Sultan. Paragraphs 16 and 18. Since the memorandum was written the Sultan has produced documents in which the _~- Na’im, al bu Shamis and Beni Ka'ab acknowledge his sov ereignty. He also has agreed to make efforts to persuade these tribes to renew their relations with him. He pays regular allowances to certain of the shaikhs for protec ting the passes. Paragraph 19 : I doubt if the list of Badu tribes is exhaustive, but cannot personally suggest the inclu sion of any other tribes except the Harasis. definitely subject to the Sultan who exercises close control over them.

I regret to say that a typing error in my Motes on the Tribes has escaped notice through several revisions * and must point out that under the note for DARU tribe, where it is stated that they are at feud with the^Wahabis”, it should read Wahiba, a tribe of the Sultanate (q. v. ). 3. However for the purposes of the Research depart ment it might perhaos be noted that all the tribes, including the DARU, but excluding the A1 bu Shamis and Naim of Buraimi, who, though originally* Sunnis and Ibadhis seem to have been converted to Wahabism as a result of invasion, and the Beni bu Ali and Beni Rasib of Jala*an, are Ibadhis or Sunnis. And though I understand that King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud is himself a Ghafiri, there is little likliho^d of the Oman tribes encouraging any extension or re crude scence|of Wahabi or Saudi influence in their territories. It is this confidence which leaves the Sultan somewhat unmoved in the matter of the Saudi claims, and he seems convinced that nd&gt; fact finding commission will be able to set to work in these territories: and that the only possible back-slide^ Suleiman bin Hamyar and ^aqr bin Sultan, can do nothing without the agreement of all the tribes, and these are still hotly opposed to any incursions by oil companies or foreign powers, which again explains the Sultans own attitude to oil development in these areas.

The main ones are those of separating those tribes whose allegiance to the Sultan is undoubted from those which, while apparently friendly towards the Sultan, are under Irnamic influence, and, even if this puzzle is satisfactorily resolved, df defining the limits of the terri tory occupied by each of the four groups into which all the tribes may be divided: Sultan’s, imam’s, doubtful and independent. 2. Whatever may have been the frontiers of the Sultanate in the distant past (and no precise definition of them is available) it is an undoubted fact that, since the latter part of the 18th Century the Sultan has been unable to exer cise authority over all the territory which was his before tnat period; that, for a number of years, elected imams have dominated the mountainous districts in the centre; but that the Sultan has never relinquished his claim to be the rightful ruler of all the country whether actually under his control or not. In the Treaty of Sib concluded between the Sultan and the Imam in 1S2C (copy attached) this claim is implied in the provision that^he will not ’'interfere in their internal affairs M (dakhaliafeathum) a formula which was deemed by the Sultan to maintain his rights of sovereignty, including the conduct of external affairs,while granting no more than the internal autonomy of the districts under the Imam. Since, in practice, the Imam and his followers eschew relations with the outside world it may be assumed that the significance of the phrase escaped them or was regarded as of no practical Importance, in spite of the fact that the Sultan had tried to insert some direct acknowledgement of his suzerainty in the terms of the Treaty. 3. As will be seen this particular aspect of the problem does not directly affect the question of the validity or otherwise of Sa’udi claims to the allegiance of tribes on the west of the Sultanate, though the Sultan’s lack of authority, past or present, in those regions adds very much to the difficulty of contesting them. 4. Broadly it nay be said that the tribes of Dhofar and the majority of the tribes of Sharqiyah and the coastal belt as far north as about 25°K acknowledge the Sultan, although his authority progressively diminishes towards the north and the tribes in Ru’us al Jibal are virtually Independent. The central block from the Eani Bu Ali in Ja’alan on either side (E. and W. Ilajar) of a north-westerly line stretching to the Jau and Kahadhah tracts (about 23°6N 56°E) is under the Imam’s rule though there is a considerable number of tribes which appear to owe doubtful or dual allegiance. With the Imam are closely associated the heads of the Hinawi and Ghafiri factions, Salih Bin Isa al harthi and Sulaiman Bin liamyar, both of whom, however, visited the Sultan in 1948, were lavishly entertained and received presents.2 5. It is possible, therefore, in the light 'of all recent evidence to define an approximate western limit to the Imarr^s territory and to define it with a fair degree of precision by ignoring the dual allegiance which tfiay be apparent in the case of certain tribes. This still-heaves a* fringe of ''independent” tribes between the Imam and the Rub 1 al Khali. (The Sultan has never been able to define the limits of his own territory in any precise terms and the line of 1937 ’’beyond which the Sultan has no claims is valueless for the purposes of argument). It is doubtful, however, whether we should be able to take the further step of claiming the sultan’s de jure^ suzerainty over all the tribes whether they are under nis own or the Imam’s jurisdiction, on the grounc tnat tney were all at a distant period under the Sultan and tnat the Sultan has never renounced his right to their allegiance although, if we do not do so, we have no real right to ac. on their behalf. Resort to ancient history immediately admits the possible validity of Sa’udi claims to Important areas, including Euraimi, and It is of little use refer to the temporary character of Wahabi occupation when w are forced to admit much longer periods during which the Sultan has had no effective jurisdiction at all. ;It is of course arguable that Wahabi Incursions into the Oman did not at any time alter the legal status of the territory, but this weakens our ground for claiming that rura^ni is tne property of Abu Dhabi, unless the Sultan himself is rea y to recognise Abu Dhabi’s succession to that place since the ’Wahabi retreat in 1869). 6. The reluctance of the Imam and of some of his more fanatical followers to admit any form of modernisation is no more than a partial safeguard. Where there ^ seen to be a handsome profit to be gained the tendency of important tribal leaders (e.g. Sulaiman Bin Hamyar) to ignore such considerations and to defect from the Imam will increase. Thus, if we and the Sultan refuse officially to recognise the independence of these shaikhs, and at the same time are unable to advance any plausible case the Sultan s sovereignty over them, we may find it very difficult to refute the Sa’udi thesis that these outlying districts are under the control of shaikhs ’’not in tre ?ty relations with H M.C-.', that H.If.G. therefore have no standing there, and that the Sa’udi Government is entitled to come to a direct agreement with those shaikhs regarding the frontier (14th Oct • 1949). 7 This Sa’udi clai m, however, deliberately ignoring the Blue and Violet lines, represents an attempt to apply trie conditions of the past to questions of the present day; to assume, in fact, that H.K.C-. has neither tne Aill * *-'ie right to develop new relations with non-coastal cniefs and tflt, in consequence, a free field is open to Sa'udi expansion, wherever it can be snown that neither H.i. nor one of their clients has actual authority. ..iis_^e y blardlv ignores the possibility that arrangements at least as advantageous to the shaikhs as any itn Sa’ud would make mirht be made by H.I.'.C-. and that H.M.G. is fully entitled to make such arrangements, either as an extension of commit ments already existing in the Trucial Coast or as a corollary to the Treaty with the Sultan. In fact it seems to be arguable even without the legal argument ot the 1-12 14 Agreements, that, whereas ibn Sa’ud has no standing withL - 3 - the tribes of Western and N. Western Cman other than that riven by an old, temporary occupation of their territory by force, H.&amp;.G. has, for a much longer period than tnat covered by the Sa’udi invasions, been the protector and ally © principal rulers, including the Sultan. fne relat^onsnip between H.M.G. and these rulers has never been such as to infringe their sovereignty but nas been designed to protect their independence in return for undertakings to preserve the maritime peace in the interests of all nationals wishing to trade in the Gulf, and for undertakings not to cede or lease territory to others without British consent isee especially Treaty with Muscat of 1891). 8 It is suggested, therefore, that this formuxa, clearly applicable to the Trucial Shaikhs and to the Sultan of Muscat, should be applied also to all tribes known to be in ^riendly relations with the Sultan whether they formally acknowledge his authority or not. From the ’’Notes on the Muscat and Cman” (EA 1C1&amp;/1C) and other sources ^ is learnt that a large number of Shaikhs have visited the Sultan a received presents of greater or less amount within the last two years. Their districts, tribes and names are as follows.- District Batinah n Western Ha jar Oman Proper Dhahirah and Jau Tribe A1 Hov/asinah Yal Sa ! ad B.

Included amongst them are certain tribes whose principal shaikhs have fairly recently visited the Sultan but would not support him in opposition to the present Imam or, on the Imam’s death, support his candidature to the Imamate. - ot induced are numerous tribes of the coastal belt which are certainly pro- Sultan, but have not recently been so reported. .C. It is pretty clear from the foregoing that the contention ihat the Sultan’s real authority is limited to ^iiOi.ar and tee oastal strip as far north as the Ru’us al Jibal is well “ounded. Moreover, from Thesiger's and other evidence, the LUthority of the Imam in the central belt would appear to Le it least as well established as that of the Sultan in territory ndisputably under his control. Arguments in favour of iaking a more 'realTiTic' view of the Sultan’s position have PAn reiected by Sir R. Hay (Confidential Despatch o. 36 of &gt; 5 th April 1950) on the ground of the difficulties in which Juch a'policy would land us. His reasoning is unanswerable ind it is possible to suggest only that the Sultan should be jncouraged to pursue more energetically the forward policy yV'ich he is believed already to be undertaking amongst tribes vho do not at present acknowledge his rule. but this process Ls bound to be a slow one and cannot ■ e expected to show any results in time to reinforce our case on his behalf against bhe Sa’udi claims. These claims in 30 f ® r tne concerned, are indefinite and relate to shaikhdoms not in treaty relations with His l.ajesty’s Government . 11 11 • • •8‘i 11 . In a note on the Sa’udi claim South and EaSt of turaimi written on 15th February 195C 1 suggested that i- ibn oa vd reiected Abu Dhabi’s claim to Buraimi (as he now does in the I emorandum of 23rd September 195C) we might regard ourselves as free to make such arrangements as appeareo desirable to us with the 'independent M shaikhs. In the light of the onbal information since received I am not sure that such a sugges- tion is of any immediate value - certainly not for purposes of negotiation with ibn Sa’ud. 12. The fact is that we have never recognised the existence of 'independent shaikhdoms' other than those with which ,ve have treaty relations, and, if such 'independent sbai^hdoms exist ( wrr’ ch we are not prepared to admits it is cleai- that, flniUon? Sey are'not subjects of ibn Sa'ud. Cn the other hand, whatever their actual administrative position, the terri- torv which they occupy has always been regarded as P® r h°£ the domains of the 'iultan of i.uscat with wnom tney remain in frie ly relations. It would, in fact, as all the evidence shows, be a matter of extreme difficulty to define exactly the boundaries nf the territory occupied by such snaikhdoms , .wing no J °to tb^ actual° indefinite ness of such tribal boundaries as ^6 thought to exist but even more to the mixture of triual s in the settled part of the country. 13. It is necessary now to see what are the trices which may claim to be independent, the basis upon w-ich their c~a^ s founded and, so far as it is possible, the district and extent of their territory. 14 ; e should, I think, ignore any claims to independence by Sulaiman Bin Hamyar (3. Riyam) and Salih bin Isa ei ® al grounds of their close association with tne umam and tieir recent visit to the Sultan, which, although they tnemselves would not admit it, gives good grounds for r ^ ar ^ n f fl ^ e,ll m ^ ht ^-oritlv owing allegiance to him. (Their case, in xact, mignt be regarded as supporting the theory that, although the Sultan bv thf) m reatT of Sib gave internal autonomy to the Imam ne retains'his rights o/suzerainty which are in practice acknowledge by the Imam’s two principal lieutenants). 15. There remain the tribes of the Jasvdiatrlet and the hadu' to the west. The former are the Na’im, the Al^u ihamis, the Ean^L'aWnd i he Bani Qitab the last two of which nave already nnt^d as being in friendly relations with the Sultan although all four are virtually independent under their own shaikhs• 16. The most recent account (EA 1019/10.) of the Na* im and -,. e Albu Shamis (which is by origin a div ^ s ^ on bhe a im . although now separated from it by internal feuds) shows that both tribes are weakened by dissension and nave ® a unitv They are Wahabi by religion (except one section of the Alb/ Shamis ^and Sa’udi influence may have increased amongst them recently, but both tribes are lacking in internal cohesion and apoear to be territorially dispersed some section 8 living in what is indisputably Sultanate territory. Thus the effect of Sa'udi influence or attempts to treat them as constituting 'Shaikhdoms’’ do not seem likely to be very successful. .he Sultan’sI7 per Sultan 1 s experiment with the Na ! im in 1948 v/hen he is sai jj 0 have got the section-leaders to sign a document acce ting Saar Bin Sultan as their tamimah is believed to have lapsed, although it is necessary to note that the reason given is the Sultan s own lack of support for the arrangement since Shaikh Saqr started independent negotiations with the Oil Company prospecting in the district (SA 1019/10), a clear indication of his wish to be regarded as independent of the Sultan, It does not necessarily follow that he would put himself or be able to put his followers under ibn Sa'ud. 17. The Albu Shamis are friendly to Abu Dhabi; the isa’im are not. 18. On the whole, therefore, there would appear to be a reasonably good case to be made for regarding all four tribes of the Jau and Dhahirah tracts as certainly independent of the Imam and on terms with the Sultan which justify a claim that they, technically at any rate, owe him allegiance, since it will not be i in ibn Sa ’udfeinterest to apply the ’’religious test. 19. The badu 1 tribes include the ■Awarnir the Daru’ the Wahibah and the Qara. 20 The Awamir have numerous small settlements in the Sultanate which acknowledge the Sultan. The bedouin fcUons which range along the edge of the Ruba' A1 Khali appear to be divided between branches one of which is in Sa'udi Arabia (E 11092) from which a Sa’udi claim to the whole of the bedouin sections is likely to arise. Information about the connection between the settled sections in the Sultanate and the more easterly bedouin sections is not available but from the account of their wild and lawless habits it seems probable that the tamimah of the se tied ns has no influence, and that what cohesion exists amongst the badu £s maintained by Shaikh Salim Bin Kamad of the Hal Haiw section 'in Sa'udi Arabia' (E 11092). 21. Information about the Daru' (or Duru') is somewhat conflicting (E 11092 and EA 1019/10) but the report in the latter remarks thlt they are 'at feud with the Wahabis* and that their tamimah visited the Sultan in 1948. 82. The Wahibah are on good terms with the Sultan and their tamimah visited him in 1948. Pt The Sara who live on the borders of Dhofar are a wild and primitive people but appear to be well-disposed to the Sultan. 24. On the whole, therefore, ignoring the rather doubtful case of the 'Awamir there seem to be good grounds, as far as the desert area is concerned, for regarding the line 'beyond which +h«= Sultan has no claims as actually representing the anuroximate limits of the diras of tribes over which the Sultan may claim some measure of control or influence. P'S The oosition in the Jau district, in which Buraimi lies, in the Mahadhah tract to the north-east of it, the home of the Pnnl Ka 1 ah. and in the Dhahirah immediately south of Jau, is ?esi easy to define. The case for regarding the Buraimi oasis itself as nart of Abu Dhabi’s territory may fall down owing to onnosition from the Sultan. This does not positively advance Sa^udi claims to the olace but naturally makes a counter-claim morei more difficult, and it is essential that we decide, before the fact-finding commission starts work, whether we intend to hack the claims to Buraimi of Abu Dhabi or of the Sultan* I suggest that, whatever the reactions of the Sultan may be, we must as part ot the policy^dealing with the actual conditions and not with vague, | remote K and temporary historical situations, be prepared to back the claims of Abu Dhabi. 26. The effect of doing so may be to alienate the Na’im still further. The Sultan cannot be expected openly to acquiesce; it would, indeed, be impolitic for him to do so for he would thus encourage others to seek independent arrangements in territory over which he claims suzerainty, and although it involves us in a measure of inconsistency, I suggest that we should support his claims to suzerainty over the other tribes of the Jau, Mahadhah and Dhahirah districts, and, if necessary, over all those whose internal affairs are managed by the Imam. Definition of the area covered by 'Buraimi' is a task for the fact-finding comnission. 27. A tribal map based on EA 1019/10 and a copy of the Treaty of Sib are attached.

This is opposed by Shaikh Saleh bin Isa, the Hinawi leader, vrho wants the next Imam to be a Hinawi. He appears to have no actual nominee at present, though Shaikh Abdulla bin Ali Khalili, a nephew of the existing Imam, is mentioned. In the meantime the Sultan is wooing both leaders with presents and hospitality to obtain their allegiance and to neutralize the position of the Imam generally. He is, however, careful not to make this apparent, and maintains friendly correspondence and relations generally with the Imam. He hopes that upon the death of the Imam, the tribes, influenced by these leaders and persuaded that reform, development and financial benefit dwtonly to be found through the Sultan, will' discard the idea of an Inanate altogether, and unite with the rest of the Sultanate into one kingdom with himself as head. But in all this the Sultan cannot afford to overlook the susceptibilities of the old fashioned tribesmen, particularly the puritanical and reactionary Ibadhis, and this fact may help towards an understanding of the extreme caution invariably displayed by the Sultan in sponsoring any move for modernisation or development. What may seem depressingly slow to a western mind may be considered dangerously fast in this backwater of Arabia c It also explains, though not necessarily excuses, certain tiresome petty restrictions in the capital. Shaikh Sulaiman bin Hamyar 3 who is ambitious and more progressive than most of the Shaikhs, has also ideas of securing recognition of himself as an independent Shaikh ? and has made certain overtures, without success, to the,British authorities, and, it is thought, may now be looking into the possibilities of achieving his purpose through American and Saudi contacts. Besides him and Salih bin Isa, the only other Shaikhs enjoying complete power and backing of their tribes to the extent of imposing capital punishment are Saif bin Amir of , the Beni ‘Ali in Dhahirah and Nasir bin Mohammad of Beni bu ! Ali sjaX^o^ - In Ua ; alarm and it is through these men that the Sultan hopes to be able to extend his influence over the tribes of the interior. Saif bin Amir is already a close friend and nay prove helpful in the Buraini area. The Imam recently demonstrated that his rule still possesses considerable virility when he raised and successfully delegated a force of three or four hundred to recover some kidnapped women and to deal with certain leaders of Dhahirah suspected of complicity. This was done in co-operation with the Muscat Government, and there have been other signs of a certain unity of mind and of purpose existing between the Sultan, Imam and the more powerful leaders ? mentioned above, in dealing with external influences, whilst a number of smaller Shaikhs in the Jau and Mahadhah tracts (Beni Ka'ab, el Na’im and al bu Shamis' have been writing affirming their loyalty and recognition of the Sultan. Though Sulaiman bin Hamyar and one or two of the Buraimi Shaikhs show signs of willingness to negotiate for oil development, the bulk of the Shaikhs of the interior, headed by the Imam, appear solidly opposed to it or to any exploitation by Europeans or Americans, and the Sultan Is convinced that it is still unsafe and premature for attempts to be made, and that no single Shaikh could enter into direct negotiations without bringing all the others against him, thus rendering him impotent./ At present» there*'or-o^ Oman enjoys a spell of peace almost without r oT, ~llol in its turbulent history, but upon the ^ death of th^ liaan, and bid for power by rival ele*- ments which will surely follow ? the situation is liable to any development.

A few tribes, notably those of the Dhofar district, have been added. This information should be treated only as supplementary to the much more extensive and ably compiled notes contained in Lorimer’s Gazetteer (190^, and the latter should invariably be consulted when more detailed information is required. These notes are in fact merely an attempt to bring the information more up to date. They are neither exhaustive nor, as indicated, can their accuracy be vouched for, though where there is a sharp difference from previous accounts, such steps as are possible have been taken to check up on the informa tion, Figures of population and rifles must necessarily be estimates of the crudest kind, and the stated tenden cies of the^tribes may be no more than the hopes of the informants. It will be noted that for the most part the population has considerably decreased. This is scarcely surprising since, apart from epidemics, which, though cholera and plague have taken severe toll, have been mercifully few, there has been a constant exodus in recent times to the oil fields,and the Muscat Consulate has for some years issued visas on Omani passports at the rate of some three thousand a year. From these revised estimates it will be seen that the tribal popu lation of the Sultanate may be less than two hundred thousand, and, with the cosmopolitan population of the coastal towns, including Muscat, Mutrah and Gwadurj the whole population of the Sultanate is probably not in excess of three hundred thousand, and former estimates of half a million are very likely excessive. The Sultan himself, though frequently approached, either through genuine ignorance or an unexplained desire for secrecy, has supplied no information of value, though few persons can have had better opportunity for accumulating knowledge through actual contact than his present Minister for the Interior, Saiyid Ahmed bin Ibrahim, His officials are no more helpful in this matter and information must be gleaned despite them rather than with their assistance. For a better Tinders tending of these notes a brief enumeration of the provinces or districts of the Sultanate may be helpful here, to the north covering the whole tip of the Oman promontory is the Ruus al Jibal. Southward (omitting Shamailiyah which is not Sultanate territory) is the Batinah - the coastal plain reaching down almost to Muscat. West of the Batinah is Western Hajar, which includes the Jibal Akhdar mountain range. Further inland is DHAHIRAH and* some what north, the Jau and Mahadhah tracts, both of - doubtful ownership. South and East lie/Eastern Hajar*/£o®% and Sharqiyah, fend then following the coast southward^ Jala*an, Batain and, finally, at the southernmost extremity, adjoining the Hadramaut of the Aden Protec torate, Dhofar. The presentThe present situation is one of general peace| with the Sultan 3 s (influence slightly increasing in the coastal dU^tricts., e,g 9 Batinah, Dhofar and Sharqiyah, and far bettor established than in his fathers day. It seems a p^cy that so many of his Walls are selected from his own tribe and are often near relations. In Oman proper and Dhahihrahj and East and West Hajar, the Triumvirate continue their rule, and when it comes to it, it seems that the vote will almost; certainly be for continuation of the Imamship in a person other than the Sultan, otherwise this indepen** dence will be lost, and at present the most likely candi date, and one who certain quarters insist has already been nominated, is the second son of the previous Imam, Abdulla bin Salim bin Rashid al Kharusi, aged at present about thirtyeight. However, though reventytwo and despite recurring rumours of ^failing health, the present Imam is by no means yet dead or even dying. A still more nebulous condition prevails in the Buraimi (i.e. Jau) area, There it would seem that neither the Imam nor the Sultan nor any other chief has any paramount authority and the four chief tribes claimed by the Sultan to be Omani and within his territories, the Naim, Beni. Ka f ab, Beni Qitab and Al Bu Shamis (acttally an offshoot of the Naim) are virtually independent and likely to remain so until it is seen who wins in the bid for oil expected to be developed in that neighbourhood. Nearly all the Shaikhs visited the Sultan in 1948 and received hospital# ity and presents from him. The general concensus of opinion^ however, seems to have been that he was niggardly in his gifts and not many will feel it worth the effort or the trouble to come again. The Sultan is certainly careful with his money, and reports of his large increase in revenue from Customs with no corresponding increase in largesse or amenities have also aroused unfavourable comment in quarters other than purely tribal. But in this case the Sultan probably realises the dominating influence of the two principal Hinawi and Ghafiri Shaikhs, and has concentrated upon them. He certainly treated them handenmely enough as can be seen from the notes upon their tribes, though to what avail time only will show-, Religion itself plays little or no part in the tribal politics and no mention has been made of it in the notes. For details of the religion of each tribe reference may be made to Loriner's Gazetteer. The bulk of the Hinawi tribes belongs to the Ibadhi sect of Islam, whilst of their Ghafiri opponents considerable numbers are orthodox Sunnis, and a few follow the W)Aahabi faith, to which they were converted at the time of the Y^ahabi invasions in the early 19th century. But the dominant sect is still Ibadhi, whose tenets were adopted as the national Omani faith in the 8 th century of the Christian era, and whose outlook is purita nical and reactionary. For the present even the Hinawi and Ghafiri rivalry seems to have died down under the Omani triumvirate, and the chief rivalry, though fortunately at present of a peaceful nature, is between the Sultan and the Imam. Upon the latters death anything may happen, violent or otherwise, and it is well nigh impossible to predict, though signs are in favour of a continuation of present arrangements. The Sultan, on the other hand, is trying hard, and seems confident of his ultimate success. This would certain* ly make for greater unity in the Sultanate as a whole, and, Since efl treaties and concessions are with the Sultan and cover only his dominions, suit British interests better. It would seem desirable therefore that the Sultan should receive British support wherever possible: a factor which in itself might be decisive.-4- BENI ALI. The present strength of this tribe is now about ^ two thousand. It could muster perhaps one thousand riflemen. Their capital is Yankul in Western Hajar and they ' • have settlements along the Wadi Dhank and in Saham. The majority are poor and cultivators, whilst a few engage in trade. With the exception of the FIDHA sub section consisting of about five hundred persons, they are of mild disposition, and fairly friendly with British and other foreigners. Their Shaikh, Saif bin Amir, is said to be a sincere friend of the present Sultan and gets a monthly v. allowance of about Rs. 60/-. He lives atXankul 2nd visited Muscat in August 1949 and stayed as the Sultan^ guest for three months. He is about forty years old and has two sons, the eldest, Amir, being his heir. He is liked and recog nised by his tribe, and appears to be much more intelligent than his people. As a Hinawi, his connection with Salih bin Isa al Harthi (see note on A1 Harth) is good. It is also good with the Imam (see note on Beni Ruwahah). It is not likely that he could rally any but his own tribe to his assistance in case of war or similar trouble, but his authority over his tribe is said to extend to the passing of death sentences, mj. BU ALI. One of the two chief tribes in Sharqiyah and •Jala r an. Its capital is Balad Beni bu Ali, forty miles south of Sur. The tribe is at feud with the Beni bu Hassan (q.v.) and as Wjtfahabis they are allied with the Beni Rasib. They are also allied with the al Hishm. Many are bedouins, and wild. Such as follow settled pursuits are cultivators, seamen and camel and donkey drivers. A very few trade with merchants in India and Pakistan. Their Tamimah is Nasir bin Mohammad al Hamud, aged about forty. He is believed to be on good terms with the Sultan and to have the support of his tribe and'to exercise absolute power over it. He is also reported to be well disposed towards the British, and it seems that the military action taken against this tribe in 1932 was salutary. EL AWAMIR. The Awamir are a poor but numerous tribe of Oman proper. Their capital is Aqil or Qala and about three thousand are settled in the Sultanate. Poverty has scattered them, and they live in small settlements getting their living as cultivators, donkey and camel men. There is a bedouin section which may amount to seven thousand ranging the interior along the edge of the Ruba’al Qali, The settled portion could muster perhaps fifteen hundred riflemen, and though normally peaceful, they often fall out with the Beni Ruwahah, Some of the bedouin portion are as ‘Afar from the part where they live between Dhofar and Mahotdvery poor, they live as bandits and engage in kidnapping. There isThere is a settlement of about two hundred at al Mobailah (near Sib) acknowledging the Sultan* and relations with.him are generally friendly. This section under Shaikh Harl-th bin Mansur bin Ghalib al Amri is at feud with the Howasinahs* and in February I960 a fracas occurred which was only prevented from developing seriously by the active intervention of the Muscat Government. Nevertheless* and in spite of their feuds with the Beni Ruwaha* the Imam’s tribe* the Awamir as a whole are not likely to vote for the Sultan upon the death of the present Imam. Their attitude to the British is good. Their Tanimah is Khamis bin Rashid bin Nasir residing at Qala aged about fifty. They have another Shaikh* named Hamad bin Rashid aged about forty, living at Quryatin. The Tamimah wields complete authority over the settled sections of the tribe. Both Shaikhs visited the Sultan in 1948 and received presents of Rs. 375/- and Rs. 25Q/- respectively• (The presents are actually always in M.T. Dollars* the only currency recognised in the interior.) BENI BATTASH. The Beni Battash is a sturdy tribe of East Hajar. The chief villages are Mayara and Hailghaf* whilst about two hundred live at Hiddah and many other villages in the Wadi Tayin* running down to the sea at Quryat. They have good rifles and are believed to have at least a thousand mostly imported from Africa. Their pursuits are seafaring* cultivation and trading. None are bedouins. A few trade with Zanzibar. • ^ They have always been at enmity with the Wahabfo?-. Though their attitude to the Sultan is friendly they will not be likely to vote for him as Imam on the death of the present incumbent. Their Tamimah is M 0 hamnad bin Harth residing at Mayara aged about fifty and they have another shaikh* ,Mohammad bin Shamis bin Mohammad Alwardi, also living at Mayara. Both visited the Sultan at Muscat in 1948 and received Rs. 750/- and Rs. 375/- yespectively. They appear to like the British. EL DiflU. The Daru is a wild and wandering tribe of bedouins, though sections have settled in Dhahirah and Batinah Districts* at Tana 1 am and Barka. They collect mostly about Jebel Hamrah, and range about from Dhahirah to Sharqiyah plying camels for hire for the carriage of t dried dates. They are p9or, treacherous and warlike* and • are at feud with the Wahibito'. Their Tamimah,-Mohammad bin Sultan, aged about fifty, and a Shaikh* Mohammad bin Said, aged about forty* visited the Sultan in 1948 and received presents of Rs. 200/- each. They seem to be on good terms with him and those one meets appear well disposed towards the British. The whole tribe might muster two thousand rifles* and may be about six thousand strong. BENI GH^FIR (or EL MIYAYIHAH). The Beni Ghafir is in two main divisions. One division lives around Khafdi* near Rostak. Their Tamimah Is Mohammad bin Nasir bin Rashid, and his brother Khalid is a Shaikh. The former ...I * } 1 *- 6 - The former is about fifty and the latter forty five.

When he visited the Sultan, also in 1948, he received Rs. 475/-. The tribe gives its name to the Ghafiri political faction to which it belongs. EL HABUS, The H£bus is an uncivilised tribe of Sharqiyah whose population, which,, however, appears to be declining, only entitles it to be mentioned© The people live around Madaibi (their capital) and Rowdha, and are primarily date cultivators and camel«*men.

They have their own dialect but know Arabic.Normally friendly to foreigners they recognise the Sultan and visit him in Dhofar.

The second division lives around Driz in the Dhahirah District. It numbers fifteen hundred and possesses about four hundred rifles. These people are bedouins, poor and warlike, engaging in cultivation and camel driving. In alliance with the first division they are also at feud with the Ibriyin. Though friendly . with the Sultan, they are under the Imam's influence and will not vote for the Sultan to succeed him. Their Tamimah is Ali bin Said aged about seventy. Yftien he visited the Sultan, also in 1948, he received Rs. 475/-. The tribe gives its name to the Ghafiri political faction to which it belongs. EL HABUS, The H£bus is an uncivilised tribe of Sharqiyah whose population, which,, however, appears to be declining, only entitles it to be mentioned. The people live around Madaibi (their capital) and Rowdha, and are primarily date cultivators and camel-men. They are in alliance / -/ ^ with the Hirth tribe and at feud with the Wah£b&amp;s^ Their disposition towards the British and the Sultan is good| but they would probably not support the latter’s candida ture for the Imamship. Their Tamimah, Khalid bin Hilal last visited the Sultan in 1948 and received a present of Rs. 375/-. ftL HAJHIYIN. The majority of the Ha^riyin is bedouin, and lives around El Bidiyah, their capital, in bharqiyah. Most are camel drivers, robl-rs and warlike. A few engage in a trade in ghee, leather and dates which extends to Africa, Zanzibar and India. Like other shaikhs, thetr Shaikh Hemdan bin Salim al Hajri, aged about forty, visited the Sultan at Muscat in 1948. He received a present of about Rsc 750/-. Though friendly with the Sultan neither he nor his tribe is likely to support L_ mdidatura for Imamship 0 The tribe is at feud with the Beni bu Ali and El Hishnjo BENI HARRAS.7- #£ /JdiXkx • BEmI HARRi\S« The population of the Beni Harras is about two thousand with not more than four hundred rifles. Their capital is Jammah in Western Hajar, and they also live around Nakhl and Samail. Though poor they are fairly civilized and peaceable, engaged mostly in cultivatl n and donkey driving. Their enemies are the Ma’awal, and allies the Beni Riyam. Their Tagaimah is Zahran bin Mohammad bin Talib, who lives at Jammaft, though two years ago he was head of Askaris at Sur. Having left Muscat Government service he bought a motor car and is now running it as a taxi between Muscat and Dubai, He drives himself, He is not liked by the Sultan and is regarded as unimportant, which he appears to be. BENI BU H ASSAN. The Beni Bu Hassan, though resembling bedouins are settled mainly around Baiad Bu Hassan in the Jala an District near Sur. They are engaged mostly in the culti vation oC dates and camel driving. They number some two thousand and are fairly well armed with cheap rifles, and are almost perpetually feud S h ^r h th ^ neighbours, the Beni Bui Ali and the El Hishm. Their allies are the Hajriyin, Hirth and Habus. They maintain a friendly attitude with the Sultan, but are not likely to accept him as successor to the present Imam, under whose influence they fall. Their Tamimah is Hamud bin Rashid, aged about forty, and his control over , good. He visited, the 6 ultan in 1948 and received Rs.750/-. Both the Imam and tne Sultan have appointed Walis to control the tribes of Jala'an (the Beni^buHassan^and^ Beni Rasib) 0 ^ n Hamud bin ShanH?c al Uiyertw. is tne Imam's, and Salim bin Hamid the Sultan's. Th ?_52 rl ?®L.tv at Baiad Bu Hassan and the latter at Kamil, about twenty miles north, BENI HINA H. The Beni Hinah is a tribe of about one thousand strong with perhaps five hundred rifles„ They are somewhat scattered bat found mostly in HMar in the S ^“^g r and Beni Ghafir, Their ch.'—f centre is Nizwa in Oman proper, whilst some are settled in the Batinan and in Dhahirah. Their Tandmah i» Zahir bin Ghuan, who is also the Iman^s Wall at Rostak. The Hii»wi faction takes its name from this tribe. Though invited several times, the Tamimah refuses to visit the SuitW^ and the tribe remains close to the Imam. They appear fa treacherous people. They are at feud with Beni Qhafir. Moat are occupied in Salivation and camel driving, but a few trade with Dubai and Sharjah. EL HIRTH j'O R HARTH OR HCRTH)_ The Hirth is an important tribo ~f the Sharqiyah District settled around Baldeh £1' Harthi, and their capita Ibra, Some are also found on the Batinahnear Sib. Salih bin Isa is their Tamimah. He is also lanimah of all th Hinawis and probably : like his father, the most influentia Shaikh in Oman .Shaikh in Oman. He is, at least outwardly, on good terms with the Sultan, and the extentuto which the latter value® his support can be judged byconijarison of the gifts made to him in 1948 with those to other Shaikhs. Salih stayed as the Sultan^ guest for three months and received rifles and ammunition and Rs, 6,000/-. It is said that he enjoys complete power, even to passing sentences of death, over his own tribe and all the Hinawis® The Hirth are intelligent and, besides the cultivation of dates, engage in trade, mostly with Zanzibar, in ghee, fish, cotton and hides. Their numbers after a decline seem to be increasing and they are spreading all over Sharqiyah. Their strength may be five thousand with two to three thousand rifles of as good quality as can be found in Oman. Salih has a nephew Ahmad, son of his brother Mohammad who was Tamimah before Salih on the death of their father Isa. Ahmad 1 s claim to succeed his father failed, and he is not on good terms with Salih, but lacks influence and tribal support generally. The tribe is in alliance with all the Hinawi tribes, and at feud with the Masakirah. Attitude to the British is good, and Shaikh Salih calls on the Consul at Muscat 0 He normally lives at Kabil (or Qabil) a few miles south of Muscat. EL HISHH. The capital of the Hishm tribe is Mamil in Jala*an, and their population about two thousand, with a about ono thousand rifles. They occupy a good strategical position between Sur and Jala'an and have a strong bedouin section. They are warlike and naid to be robbers. They have, however, always supported the 8 &gt;Ctan, and hate the Imam. Their attitude to the British is very good. Their more settled pursuits are fishing, cultivation and camel rearing. Their Shaikhs are Khadim ^bin Mohammad aged about fifty. Hulais bin Khadim (notf'fche former r s son) aged about fiftyfive and Abdulla, bin Said bin Rashid aged about sixty. There is no Tamimah but all three live at Kamil amicably, and would support the Sultan's candidature for the Imamship if the occasion arose:but the tribe as a whole has no great influence. They are said to have received a joint present of Rs. 2,500/- from the Sultan when they visited him in 1948. EL HOWASIHAH. The capital of the Howasinah tribe is at El Ghaizain about thirty miles west of Khaburah on the Batinaho They are also found in bi^ settlements in and around Khaburah in the Wadi Howasinah, as the name implies. Their population is about three thousand and they have good rifles, not exceeding a thousand. They are normally peaceful, but are old enemies of the Beni Omar, and more recently of the Awamir* They are formidable fighters, and a fracas in which they were involved with the Awamir in February 1950 near Khaburah and Sib, was only prevented from serious developament by the prompt intervention of Saiyid Majid, the Suit,‘in's brother and Wall of Masna ! ah.

They are also found in the Wadis al Qor and Hatta, and in Sohar and Liwa. Their bhief Shaikh is Obaid bin Juina bin Duiain, andhe receives small allowances from the Sultan through the Wall of Sohar. The tribe is friendly to the Sultan and Obaid bin Juma accompanied his Minister for the Interior back from Buraimi in 19 * 4-8 in connection with oil company negotiations, and visited the Sultan in Muscat. The Kathir is the principal tribe of Dbofar or capital at Salalah, They also live in tne Samhan hills behind the Dhofar plain. They number about five thousand, and possess about fifteen hundred rifle? The Sultan has prohibited for many years now the importation of ^ new riflec into this district, so that those that exist must- be getting very old indeed.

They all belong to the Hinawi political faction but are too distant to enter into Oman politics• The Sultan seems to get on well with them, and their attitude is friendly to the British, though shy and cautious on first arpproach. BENI KHAHUS. The Beni Kharus is a peaceful and comparatively civilised tribe in the centre of Oman proper, settled mainly at Rostak, Nakhl and Awabi, the capital. The tribe supplied the present Imam T s predecessor, and, on his assassination in 1920, his three sons Yahya, Abdulla BENI KITTAB (or Qitab) The Beni Qitab (as the name is best transliterated) are divided into two main sections. The larger section live around DHAID in Sharjah territory with Shaikh Mohammad bin Ali bin Huwaidin as their Chief, and it is understood that he gets an annual allowance of some R 3 25&gt;000 from the Ruler. The other section, which seems to have become completely separated live in DHAHIRAH, with their caoital at Aflaj Bent Qitab. Their Shaikh is Mohammad bin Ali bin Rabaiyah. Though he accompanied the Sultan* s Minister for. the Interior back to Muscat in 1946 to visit the Sultan when the Minister was touring the Buraimi neighbourhood in connection with certain oil company negotiations, he gets no allow ances from the Sultan, and is not on any close terms with him. On the contrary his people seem to regard themselves as in allegiance with the Imam, and frequently visit his Wali at (X5RI (in Bhahirah), from whom the Shaikh is saii ^o draw an allowance. Two other Shaikhs named Fazil bin Rabaiyah and Amir bin Salih Walid al Matawa belong to this tribe. The latter was involved in a recent attempt to kidJifcj two women from Sultanate territory for slavery but was compelled by the Imam, who sent a force of about four hundred men, to release them and plead f^rgiva» ness. This incident affords evidence of there being at least some measure of co-operation between the Sultan and the Imam.

BENI KHARUS. The Beni Kharus is a peaceful and comparatively civilised tribe in the centre of Oman proper, settled mainly at Rostak, Nakhl and Awabi, the capital. The tribe supplied the present Imam f s predecessor, and, on his assassination in 1920, his three sons Yahya, Abdulla and Yakub, then aged about ten, eight and six, were taken charge of and have been brought up by the present Imam ever since. Yahya, who is Tamimah of the Beni Kharus has been appointed Wali of Samail by the Imam, and his brother,Abdulla Wall of Nakhl, It is reported from many quarters that, in 1948 when he was undergoing a very severe attack of dysentery, the Imam summoned a majlis of all the Omani Shaikhs and nominated Abdulla as his successor, and got them all to sign a document that they would vote for him on his demise. It is believed in these quarters that the majority of the tribes are still of the same mind, and that the Sultan has little hope of being elected. Apart from anything else the Omani tribes are exceedingly independent minded, and the treaty of Sib in 1920 established in their view their complete independence of the Sultan, and it seems unlikely that they will readily forego this by voting him in as their Imam, or by agreeing to any measure which will restore the Sultan’s jurisdiction. In 1948 when many other Shaikhs visited the Sultan, one old Shaikh of this tribe, Khalfan bin Othman, another close friend of Ahmed bin ibrahim, the Minister for Interior, came to Muscat, but Yahya did not come, and neither he nor his brothers have ever visited Muscat or met the Sultan, The tribe as a whole is not numerous and its members are employed mostly in tending camels and in cultivation. EL NA'IM-12 EL NA* IM (including Al bu Shamis)c The Naim tribe was formerly the most numerous and powerful tribe of the central portion of the Oman promontory partly nomadic and partly settled in both Trucial and Sultanate Oman. A branch of the tribe also migrated to Bahrain and Qatar generations ago. The Na’im are divided into two main sub-divisions, Al bu Kharaiban and Al bu Shamis, For years the tribe has been torn by internal dissension and both their influence and population are now much depleted. The total strength of the bedouin and settled portion of the tribe in Sultanate Oman, that is in Dhahirah district and the somewhat disputed Jau tract in which the Buraimi Oasis lies, and which is regarded by the Na l im as their headquarters, might be about five thousand, mustering perhaps two thousand rifles: but they could never be regarded as one force. Settled in undisputed Sultanate territory are perhaps two thousand, with about eight hundred rifles. Of these the Al bu Shamis division has altogether broken away from the Naim and may for all practical purposes be regarded as a separate tribe, with their headquarters also in the Buraimi area. A bedouin section under Shaikh Mohammad bin Salmin bin Hahmahlives around Sanainah and Qabii, south of Buraimi e A settled portion,'^ under Shaikh Rashid bin Hamad al Shamis lives in Hamasah near Buraimi, whileu another section, who unlike the others, are Hinawis, is settled around Dhank (Dhahirah district) under Shaikh Matar bin Salim al Azizi. The bedouin section of the Al bu Shamis could muster about four hundred rifles: the other section are negligible. Their total population may be one thousand. The Sultan claims influence over the Al bu Shamis and has stated that he pays them annual allowances and fines them for disturbances or diprders occuring in their territory. There is no evidence o A f either payments or fines in recent years, and it is doubtful if in fact the Sultan or Imam of Oman exercise any control, and the tribe is virtually independent, though at least portions are settled in undisputed Sultanate territory (i,e 0 Dhank). Shaikh Mohammad bin Salmin bin Rahmdiis believed to have visited ... the Sultan in 1948 and to have offered to place himself and his followers at his disposal for Rs* 25 ; 000/- (M.T. Dollars 10,000). The Sultan seems to have been unimpressed and to have sent him away with a present of M.T. Dollars 500/- (Rupees 1,250). With regard to the rest of the Na’im in Sultanate Oman, that is the settled rertion of the Al bu Khuraiban division; the principal shaikh appears to be Saqr bin Multan al Hamud. His influence is weak, and does not approach that of his father. He lives, it is said, in fear of the Shaikhs Humaid bin Rashid of the bedouin section and p#*Rashid bin Hamaid of Ajman (Trucial coast). In 1948, however, the Sultan claims to have got the Na 1 im through the offices of his Minister for the Interior, Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim, to accept Shaikh Sacr as their Tamimah and to have signed a document to that effect. More recently though, because • •«-13~ / because Shaikh Saqr started to take -•a independent line in negc nations „ith the-OjJLCor^ny prospecting in the Buraimt area, the Sultan has not been giving his support to thi.s arrangement, and Shaikh Saqr-s influence is again on the decline, so that in due course, the Sultan hopes, he will have to appeal again to the Sultan; always provided the oil people make no fuither direct approach. Other sections of the Na ? im in Sultanate territory live around Dhank and Hatif m both the plains ’arj. hills. The Na'im are on bad termb with the A1 bu Falah of Trucial Oman and the Sultanate settlements B ® ni Ka 1 ab, Beni Qitab and with their sub-division, the A1 bu Shamis. Not counting the A3 bu Shamis, they could probably not raise more than three or four hundred rifles, even if the various sub-sections could unite. In the past there was Saudi influence which may again be reviving, and the Na*imj including the Al bu Shamis, follow the Wahabi religion., The Al bu Shamis are on good terms with the # A1 r&amp;lah, Duru and Beni Qitab. The area all around buv-d limj is ■’incontrolled, and any foreigners vi c: ' ,4 ' ^nr, It to 6 ulci reQuivs military protection and Cciyerul previous an ungements through official channels. A considerable traffic in slaves is still reported to be carried on, and the fort at Hamsah in A ' 1 ’ ohamis (and Sultanate) territory is believed to be one main clearing house. A* / / / QAHAo The Qara tribe which lives in the hills of Dhofar district is primitive and uncivilised. The people do not look like Arabs, and are probably a branch of the Mahras from the Hadramaut (Aden Protectorate). They belong, however, to the Ghafirl faction, but do not appear to take any part in politics or to be at feud with the neighbouring Kathir tribe which is Hinawi. Except for a few who live in Salalah and Marbat, they keep to the hills, and dwell in caves,, They rear camels, cattle,, sheep and goats, and seem to come to the plains to. ’•purchase, in exchange for hides and ghee, such gram and vegetables/they need. Though regarded as unreliable, they appear to be peaceable eno^crh at the present time.

RENT RIYAlvl. The Beni Riyam is the largest tribe in Oman, the population now exceeding perhaps fifteen ^“npR^and^ave whole they are civilised and peaceabxy inclined, and have few rifles, possibly less thaii a thousand. In comparison with 1 others the?r intelligence is high They live mainly in the mountain region of the Jeoal ^Jchdar, where they have over fifty villages. With good water supplies and pastur^lands, they are able to keep cattle, and consume a wine made from grapes which they grow* Though their Tamimah, Suleiman bin Hamyar. who is also Tamimah of all the Ghafiris, is, like Salih &gt; the Hinawi leader, close to the Imam, the tribe itself at feud with the Ruwahah (the Imams tru^ej. Shaikh Suleiman and his eldest son and heir. s '4 ta ^’J£ s: 4pn4st Sultan at Muscat in 1948. There he received the greatest hospitality, during which his daily expenditure is under stood to have cost the Sultan Rs. 200-™ for the fortyfive days of his stay. On leaving the 'Sur .an is supposed to have given him M.T. Dollars 50,000 (Rs. 1,25,€00), five American Rifles, ammunition, ten bags °i r lc0 &gt; J^ g 'took of sugar and a .hep. This last the Shaikh, who drives, took to his homo Tanuf via the Batinah, Wadi Dhank, xanqul and Ibric Ho built a road to Muti intending .o join UP with the Wadi Samail, making a short route to iusoau, but w prevented by the Imam and people of that territory. As the head of one of the larger Hinawi tribes himself, the Sultan probably considers Salih bin Isa a Harthi lass important to placate, as ? though he for considerable favours too, they were not upon this scale, and it is clear from his extra lavish treatment °f the Ghafiri leader the importance which the Suloan attaches t his position, and his anxiety to get his support in the election for Imamshlp which will follow une decease o. t present incumbent. Which way Shaikh Suleiman, who is himself about forty, will go is any one's guess, at present his outward attitude, whilst friendly to the Sultan, is aliegience to the Imam. The Beni Riyam are on gooa terns with the Ghafiri tribes of Oman, and their attitude to ^ e „ B np'much wevia probably be friendly, though they havenot c-me much in contact with them. Shaikh Suleiman himseii gets about, and is friendly frith the American missionaries# BENI RU W AHAH . 'he tribe ■* s main! ,r lot n Ha jar - in the upper - part of the Wadi called the Wadi b-ni . They are however divided into two main factions which^aro opposed to one another# These are described by -ocatxtn on the Wadi Beni Ruwahah, El Sharqi (Bast) ’under Shaikh Salih , bin Harib numbering about twelve hundred? and E± Gnarj- ; (West) ur.der Shaikh. Saif bin Ahmed bin Hamid? numbering about two thousand. The latter are against the Imam ol Oman for reasons which are obscure? though he is the ; accepted Tanimab of the whole tribe, Other • •~15~ % Other settlements of the tribe are to be found in Samail, Izki, Nizwa ? Boshar and even Zanzibar. The total population may reach eight thousand or even more, and their rifles two thousand. The people are mainly cultivators and donkey drivers. About forty are employed as Askaris inMatrah. The tribe is at feud with the Beni Riyam and Beni Jabir. Both Shaikhs visited the Sultan in 1948 and received presents of about Rs. 500/-* each. The Imam, Mohammad bin Abdullah al Khalili, as tribal leader appears to have little to do with his tribe. As elected Imam of Oman since 1920 he has considerable spiritual power over the tribes as a whole. His temporal power is shared, more or less equallyjwith the leaders of the Ghafiri and Hinawi factions, and together these three exercise a fairly effective independent control over the interior of Oman proper ? where the Imam appoints his own Walis. He lives at Nizwa, insists upon a strictly purita nical way of life, and is opposed to all progress such as oil development andjnotor transport 5 and to penetration by Europeans ( and probably Americans) especially Christian»| though the Missionary doctors have been called to him in ^ sickness. He has brought up the ihroe sons of the late ImamjYofcya* Abdulin and Yakub f and in some quarters it is held that, in 1948, when . .iffering from dysentery he nominated the second .eon as his successor, and that this has the support of many of the tribesr Other quarters insist that he has refused to make a nomination, inspite of entreaty by various other leaders in 19471 Whichever is true, as has been shown in these notes, the Sultan appears to have encouraged all the leaders to visit him at Muscat in 1948. He has also tightened up on religious observances and. retarded many poss?.ble developments since; oil in_ particular 4 and has endeavoured to build up a reputation for religious orthodoxy. In the meantime (July 1950) the Jmam is reported to be in excellent health and to be looking much younger than his 72 years. Khalil with which he completes his name is a sub-section of the Ruwaha« SA'AD,-, . The Yal Sa f ad are reckoned as numerically the second largest tribe in Oman. They live in an almost solid block around el Khadra and Suwaik on the Batinah coast, with their capital somewhat inland at El Batha. Their other big villages are Mladdah, Tharmad and Bu. Abali. The present population is about ten and they may possess as many as six thousand rifles , oone are Bedouins, wild and warlike, and some are said to be famous for slaving, and still to engage in kidnapping from Mekran and Africa. For the most part they are settled and own exten sive date gardens, and peaceably inclined. Many are wealthy and engage in trade with Africa and India. Their Tamimah is a comparatively young nan of about thirty living at el Batha, named Hamad bin Hilal bin Hamad. He succeeded his father about three years ago. Another Shaikh of the sub-section Yal bu Rashaid, named Khalid bin Salim bin Khalid ' * lives at el Khadra.

AL BU SA ! ID.16- BU. S^P,i. This is the tribe of the Sultans of Muscat and Oman. The present Sultan is head of it and their Tamimah. The people are scattered and number about two thousand,. with about*four hundred rifles outside the Sultan^ military and personal resources. Most of them are poor and employed in cultivation. Some are goldsmiths, especially in Nizwa and Manaht The tribal capital is Adam and small settlement^ are found in Manah, Nizwa, Izki, Samail, Sohar, Sib, Bosharj Muttrah and, of course, the Sultan^ relations in Muscat. About three hundred are settled in Zanzibar as cultivators^ and some as * 4 * 0 -traders. The Sultan appears to have appointed many Walis from this tribe. They are allied with the Janabah and Duru and do not appear to be at feud with any tribe. The title 'Saiyid 11 is officially reserved to the Sultan and his close relative#^ though many use it. This is the oldest tribe of the three tribes in Dhofar District, and may be aboriginal. The people speak a dialect called Kazrat (so named by the Arabs from its ''sizzling” sound). The people are completely primitive and wear few cloths, living, except for a few in Salalah, exclusively in caves in the Samhan hills. They have a reputation for thieving and treachery, but at present seem to be living quiety enough. Crime is in fact extremely rare in Dhofar where the Sultan and his trusted Wali keep close touch with the people. The Shares live by cattle, sheep and goat rearing, and the procurement of frankincense, though this industry has very greatly declined in modern times, owing, it is though^ to more readily accessible substitutes. The Shares take no part in tribal politics and are neither Ghafiri nor Hinawi, Their Tamimah is Ajham bin FarsiJi and their numbers may be one or two thousand with about six hundred primitive rifles and swords or knives. ffL SHIHUH. The tribal capital is said to be Khasab, but the tribe itself is widely scattered over the whole Hu'us al Jibal district of the Sultanate. They number about eight thousand and may possess about fiteen hundred rifles. Those settled on the coast live by fishing, pearling (in the Persian Gulf) and date cultivation where possible. Those in the hills of the interior rear goats and poultry, and grow grain. They have their own dialect or language called , Shihuiyah, but also know Arabic., They used to be at feud A*/*/ with the Dhahuriyin, but this tribe is even more primitive and now nearly extinct. It is composed almost entirely of L&lt; ^ fishermen, who migrate wholesale from their villages to ^ cooler places in the summer. There i s no recogn ised Tamimah but the most important Shaikh of the/fShihuhT is Hass an bin ((M.

At Khasab the Sultan exercises some control thrcu.gh a Wall, but in the mountain regions of the interior and the inaccessible coastal villages, control or administration is non-existent. A peculiar, wild, completely isolated and unfriendly section, known as the Kumzaris, lives at Kumzar near the most norther/ily point of the promontory. They too have their own dialect. Their Shaikh is Salih bin Mohammad. As the bark of a dog is said to dry up all the springs, no dog should ever accompany anyone on a visit to Shihuh territory. The Shihuhs are full of superstitio- and believe in spirits, fairies and angles. Except for the remnants of the Dhahuriyin this is the only tribe of the Ruus al Jib al. The Rupee, and not the M.T. Dollar, is the currency in this district. YAL wahibah. The Wahibah is an important tribe found mainly in the Sharqiyah and Jala 1 an districts, . It probably numbers five thousand and is well armed with perhaps two thousand rifles. The • headquarters seen to be at Sadairah, and Muahaibi. The tribe is mostly bedouin, though settlements exist at the two places named and at Boshar and Muscat, nnH in the Batinah. They are poor, brave and warlike. Their Tamimah is Humud bin Sultan bin Mansur and another leading Shaikh is named Humud bin Saif. The former visited the Sultan in 1948, and received Rs. 500/-, Their attitude to the Sultan and British is good but they support the &lt;u\d are unlikely to vote for the Sultan as successor. They are at feud with the Janabah and Duru. The tribe’s name should not be confused with the Wahabi religion. The people are, in fact, Ibadhis, and belong to the Hinawi political faction. SUR. A list of the Shaikhs and important persons of Sur, which is the next town in importance after Matrah and Muscat, and often visited by H.M’s ships and British officials, is given below, with the names of the tribal sections to which they belong, as supplied by one of the Shaikhs. They have for long been at variance with the Sultans and evaded taxation. They respect the British for the power with which they are able to back the Sultan, and inspite of this running contrary to their interests they are friendly and good hosts, at least,, to official visitors. They all belong to the Janabah tribe and head the sections named.

He said he would reply through Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim.

He promised to consider this and said that when he was at Dhofar he had received a letter from Shaikh Saif bin ’Amir of the Yankal asking for permission to visit him and that he proposed to send for him and to discuss the tribal situation with him. Saif, he told me, was a Shaikh of the Beni Ali and was one of the only three shaikhs in Oman who was powerful enough to order the execution of one of his tribesmen. The other two such Shaikhs were the Shaikh of the Beni bu Ali in ja’alan and Sulaiman bin Himyar. 2. I also mentioned to the Sultan a document signed by a number of Buraimi shaikhs which he had shown me at my interview with him in the 7th April, but of which he had not given me a copy.

L i e ut e na nt-C ol one 1 Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., (L.A.C. Fry) Bahrain.COIOTDEifflAL, ME 86/50 The Tribes of i!uBO&amp;t and Oman, Ajny attempt to asoertain the territorial limits of the Sultan's sovreignity or suzerainity on the baais of tribal allegiance - which appears to be the o-nly possible one in which actual conditions will be depicted - meets considerable difficulties. The main ones are those of separating those tribes whose whose allegiance to the Stiltan is undoubted from those which f while apparently, friendly toward the Sultan are under Imandc influence, and, even if this puzzle is satisfactorily resolved, of defining the limits of the territory occupied by each of the four groups into which all the tribes may be divided: Sultan's, Imam*s, doubtful and independent. 2. Whatever may have been the f^rentiers of the Sultanate in the distant past (and no precise definition of or them is available) it is an undoubted fact t at, since the latter part of the 18th century the Sultan has been unable to exercise authority over all the territory which was his before that period; that, for a number of years, elected Imams have dominated the mountainous districts in the centre; but tliat the Sultan has never relinqxiishedjiis claim to be the rightful ruler of all the country whether 'under his actual! control or not. In the Treaty of Sib concluded between the Sultan and the Imam in 1920 (copy attached) this claim is implied in the provision that he will not 'interfere in their internal affairs' ( dakhali-tahum) a formula which was deemed by the Sultan to maintain his rights of sovereignty including the conduct of external affairs while granting no more than the internal autonomy of the districts under the Imam. Since, in practice, the Imam and his followers eschew relations with the outside world it may be assumed that the significance of the phrase escaped them or was regarded as of no p aotioal importance, in spite of the fact that the Sultan had tried to insert some direct acknowledgement of his suzerainty in the terms fcf the Treaty. 3. As will be seen this particular aspect of the problem does not directly effect the question of the validity or otherwise of Sa’u&amp;i claims to the allegiance of bribes on the west of the Sultanate, though the Sultan's lack of authority, past or present, in those regions adds very much to the difficulty of contesting them. 4. Broadl it may be said that the tribes of Dhofar and the majority of the tribes of Sharqiyah and the coastal belt as far north as about 25°K acknowledge the Sultan, although his authority progressively diminishes towards the north and the tribes in Ru’us al Jibal are virtually independent. The central block from the Bani Bu Ali in Ja* alan on either side (E and W Ha jar) of a north westerly line stretohing to the Jau and ahadhah tracts(about 23O6N 56 °E) is under the Imam's rule though there is a consider able number of tribes which appear to owe doubtful or dual allegiance. With the Imam are closely associated the heads of the Hinawi and Ghafiri factions, Salih bin Isa al Hart hi and Sulaiman bin Hamyar, both of whan, however, visited the Sultan in 1948, were lavishly entertained and received presents.5. It is possible, therefore, in the light of all recent evidence to define an approximate western limit to the Imam’s territory and to define it with fair degree of orecision by ignoring the dual allegiance which may be apparent in the case of certain tribes* This still leaves a fringe of 'independent' tribes between the Imam and the Rub ’al Khali (TAe Sultan has never been able to define the limits of his own territory in any precise terms and the line of 1937 'beyond which the Sultan has no claims' is valueless for the purposes of argument)* It is doubtful, however, whether we should be able to take the further step of claiming the Sultan s de jure suzerainty over all thejtribes when they are under his own or the Imam's jurisdiction, on the ground that they were all at a distant period under the Sultan and that the Sultan has never renounced his right to their allegiance although, if we do not do so, we have no real rig t to act on their behalf. Resort to ancient history immediately admits the possibility validity of Sa’udi claims to important areas, including Buraind, and it is of little use to refer to the temporary character of Wahabi occupation when we are forced to admit much longer periods during which the Sultan has had no effeotive Jurisdiction at all. (it is of course arguable that Wahabi incursions into the Oman did not at ary time alter the legal status of the territory, but this weakens our ground for claiming that Buraind is the property if Abu Dhabi, unless the Sultan himself is ready to recognise Abu Dhabi’s succession to that place since the Wahabi retreat in 1869)* 6* The reluctance of the Imam and of some of his more fanatical followers to admit any form of modernisation is no more than a partial safeguard* Where there is seen to be a handsome profit to be gained the tendency of important tribal leaders (e.g. Sulaiiran bin flanyar) to ignore such considerations and to defect from the Imam will increase* Thus, if we and the Sultan refuse officially to recognise the independence of these shaikhs, at the,same time are unable to advance any plausible case for the Sultan s sovereignty over them we may find it very difficult to refute the Su’udi thesis that these outlaying districts are under the control of shaikhs 'not in treaty relations with , that H.M.G-. therefore have no standing there, and that the Su’udi Government is entitled to come to a difiat agreement with those shaikhs regarding the frontier (14th Oct. 1949) 7* This Sa’udi claim, however, deliberately ignoring the Blue and Violet lines, represents an attempt to apply the conditions of the past to the questions of the present coy; to assume, in fact, that has neither the will nor the right to develop new relations with non-coastal chiefs and that, in consequence, a free field is open to Sa’ud 4 expansion, wherever it can be shown that neither H*I«*G’* nor one of their clients lias actual authority. This theory blandly ignores the possibility that arrangement sat least as advantageous to the shaikhs as any Ibn Baud would make might be made by H.M.G. and that H.M.G, is fully entitled to make such arrangements, either as an extension to committments already existing in the Trucial coa*t or as a corollary to the Treaty with the Sultan* In fact it seems to be agruable even without the legal argument of the 1913 - 14 Agreements, that, whereas I rib ^ud has no standing with theth« tribes of Western and N. Western Onan other than that given by an old, temporary occupation of their territory by fares, H.M.G. has, for a much longer period than that conered by the Sa*udi invasions, been the protector and ally of the principal rulers, including the Sultan, The relationship between and these rulers has never been such as to infringe their sovereignty but has been designed to protect their independence in return for undertakings to preserve the maritime peace in the interests of all nationals wishing to trade in the Gulf, and for undertakings not to code or lease territory bo others without British consent (see especially Treaty with Muscat of 1891)• 8 . It is suggested, therefore, that this formula, clearly applicable to the Trucial Shaikhs and to the Sultan of Muscat, should be applied also to all tribes known to be in friendly relations with the Sultan whether they formally acknowledge his authority or not. From the rt Notes on the Tribes of Muscat and Oman' (EA 1019A0) an ^ other sources it is learnt that a large number of Shaikhs have visited the Sultan and received presents of greater or less amount within the last two years.

In the above list have been included only those tribes about which some positive information {/•visited auxtan m xyw &gt; with Sultan' and the like) is available. Included amongst them are certain tribes whose principal shaikhs have fairly recently visited the Sultan but would not support him in opposition to the present Ir;am or, on the Imam’s death, support his candidature to the Imamate. I T ot included are numerous tribes of the coastal belt which are certainly pro-Sultan, but have not recently been so reported. 10. It is pretty clear from the foregoing that the contention that the Sultan’s real authority is limited to Dhofar and the coastal strip as far north as the Ru’us al Jibal is well founded. Moreover, from Thesiger’s and other evidence, the authority of the Imam in the central belt would appear to be at least as well established as that of^the Sultan in territory indisputably under his c ontrol. Arguments in favour of taking a more 'realistic' view of the Sultan’s position have been rejected by Sir R. Bay (Confidential Despatch No.3o of 25 th April 1950; on the ground of the difficulties in which such a policy would land us. His reasoning is unanswerable and it is possible to suggest only that the Sultan should be encouraged to pursue more energetically the forward policy which he is believed already to be undertaking amongst tribes who do not at present acknowledge his rule. But this process is bound to be a slow one and cannot be expected to show any results in time to reinforce our case on his behalf against the s&amp;’udi claims# These claims in so far as the Oman is concerned, are indefinite and relate to 'sheikhdoms not in treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government • 11 11. In a note on the Sa’udi claim South and East of Burain.i written on 15th February 1950 I suggested that if Ibn Sa’ud rejected Abu Dhabi’s claim to Buraimi (as he now does in the Memorandum of 23rd September 1950 ) we might regard ourselves as free to make such arrangements as appeared desirable to us with the 'independent ' shaikhs. In the light of the tribal information since received I am not sure that such a pri est ion is of any immediate value - certainly not for purposes of negotiation with Ibn Saud.12. The fact is that we have never recognised the existence of 'independent sheikhdoms' other than those with which we have treaty relations, and, if such 'independent shaikhdoms' exist (which we are not prepared to admit) it is clear that, by definition, they are not subjects of Ibn Sa*ud. On the other hand, whatever their actual admin istrative position, the territory which they occupy has always been regarded as part of the domains of the Sultan of l!uscat with whom they remain in friendly relations. It would, in fact, as all the evidence shows, be a matter of extrema difficulty to define exactly the boundaries of the territory occupied by such 'shaikhdoms', owing not only to the actual indefiniteness of such tribal boundaries as may be thought to exist but even more to the mixture of tribal sections in the settled part of the country. 13. It is necessary now to see what are the tribes which may claim to be independent, the basis upon which their claim is founded and, so far as it is possible, the district and extent of their territory. 14. We should, I think, ignore any claims to independence by Sulairaan bin Htayar (B. Riyam) and Salih bin Isa (Hirth) on the dual grounds of their olose association with the Imam and their recent visit to the Sultan, which, although they themselves would not admit it, gives good grounds for regarding them as tacitly owing allegiance to him* (Their oase, in fact, might be regarded as supporting the theory that, although the Sultan by the Treaty of Sib gave internal autonoiqy to the Imam he retains his rights of suzerainty which are in practice acknowledged by the Imam’s two principal lieutenants.) 15. There remain the tribes of the J&amp;u district and the badu* to the west. The former are the TTa’im, the Al bu Shamis, the Ban! Ka’ab the Bani Qitab the last two of which have already been noted as being in friendly relations with the Sultan although all four are virtually independent under their own shaikhs, 16. The most recent account (EA 1019/10) of the Na'im and the Al bu Shamis (which is by origin a division of the Na’im although new separa ted from it by internal feuds) shows that both tribes are weakened by dissension and have little real unity. They are Wahabi by religion (except one section of the Al bu Shamis) and Sa’udi influence may have increased amongst them recently, but both tribes are lacking in internal cohesion and appear to be territorially dispersed some sections living in what is indisputably Sultanate territory. Thus the effect of Sa’udi influence or attempts to treat them as constituting 'Shaikhdoms' do not seem likely to be very successful* The Sultan’s experiment with the Na’im in 1948 when he is said to have got the section-leaders to sign a document accepting Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan as their tamimrh is believed to have lapsed, although it is necessary to note that the reason given is the Sultan’s own lack of support for the arrangement since Shaikh Saqr started independent negotiations with the Oil Company prospecting in the district (J3A 1019/10), a clear indication of his wish to be regarded as independent of the Sultan. It does not neces sarily follow that he would put himself or be able to put his followers under Ibn Sa’ud. 17. The Al bu Shamis are friendly to Abu Dhabi; the Na’im are not. 18* On the whole, therefore, there would appear to be a reasonably good oase to be made for regarding all four tribes of the Jau and Dhahirah tracts as certainly independent of the Imam and on terms with the Sultan which Justify a claim that they, technically at any rate, owe him allegiance, since it will not be in Ibn Saud’s interest to apply the 'religious test.'19* The badu* tribes include the •Awandr’, the 'Daru’ the WaMbah and the Qara* 20. The Awamir have numerous small settlements in the Sultanate which acknowledge the Sultan* The bedouin sections which range along the edge of the Ruba f al Khali appear to be divided between branches one of which ia in Sa’udi Arabia (E 11092) from which a Sau»di claim to the whole of the bedouin sections is likely to arise. Information about the connection between the settled sections in the Sultanate and the more easterly bedouin sections is not available but from the account of their wild and lawless habits it seems probable that the taudmah of the settled sections has no influence, and that what cohesion exists amongst the badu is maintained by Shaikh Selim bin harrad of the Hal Haiw section 'in Sa'udi Arabia' (E 11092). 21. Information about the Daru’ (or Duru*) is somewhat conflicting (li 11092 and EA 1019/10) but the report in the latter remarks that they are 'at feud with the Wahabis' and that their tarnimah visited the Sultan in 194B* 22. The Wahibah are on good terms with the Sultan and their tamimah visited him in 1948 . 23. The Qata who live on the borders of Dhofar are a wild and primitive people but appear to be w11—disposed to the Sultan. 24. On the whole, therefore, ignoring the rather doubtful case of the *Awandr* there seem to be good grounds, as far as the desert area is concerned, for regarding the line 'beyond which the Sultan has no claims' as actually representing the approximate lindts of the dir as of tribes over which the Sultan may claim some ineasure of control or influence. 25. The position in the Jau district, in which Buraimi lies, in the Mahadhah tract to the north-east of it, the home of the Bard : a'ab, and in the Dhahirah in mediately south of Jau, is less easy to define. The case for regarding the Buraimi oasis itself as part of Abi^ Dhabi territory may fall down owing to opposition from the Sultan. This does not positively advance Sa’udi claims to the place but naturally makes a counter-claim more difficult, and it is essential that we decide, before the fact-finding commission starts work, whether we intend to back the claims to Buraimi of Abu Dhabi or of the Sultan. I suggest that, whatever the reactions of the Sultan may be, we must as part of the policy of dealing with the actual conditions and not with vague, remote and temporary historical situations, be prepared to back the claims of Abu Dhabi. 26. The effect of doing so may be to alienate the Na'im still further. The Sultan cannot be expected openly to acquiesce! it would, indeed, be impolitic for him to do so for he would thus encourage others to seek independent arrangements in territory over which he claims suzerainty and although it involves us in a measure of inconsistency, I suggest that we should support his claims to suzerainty over the other tribes of the Jau, Mahadhah and Dhahirah districts, and, if necessary, over &lt; 0 , 1 those whose internal affairs are managed by the Imam. Definition of the area covered by 'Buraimi” is a task for the fact-finding commission. 27. A tribal map based on EA 1019/10 and a copy of the Treaty of Sib are attached.

The ain ones are t’ose of separating those tribes whose whose allegiance to the Sultan is undoubted from those which, while apparently, friendly toward the ultan are under Imamic influence, and, even if this puzzle is satisfactorily resolved, of defining the limits of the territory occupied by each of the four groups into which all the tribes may be divided: titan’s, Imam’s, doubtful and independent. 2, Tiatever may have been the ffrontiers ol tne ..uloana.ue i. the distant past (and no recise definition ol/^ tnen is available y it is an undoubted fact t at, since the latter part of the 18th century the Sultan has been unable to exercise authority over all the territory which was his before that period; that, for a number of years, elected Trams have dominated the mountainous districts in the centre; but that the Sultan has never relinq uished hjsjs laim to be the rightful ruler of all the country whether hinder his actuall control or not. In the Treaty of Jib concluded be twee nt he Sultan and t e Imam in 15'20 (copy attached) this claim is implied in the provision that he will not ’’interfere in their internal affairs' (dakhali-tahum) a formula which was deemed by the Jultan to maintain his rights of sovereign/ty including the conduct of external affairs while granting no more than the internal autonomy of the districts under the Imam. Since, i practice, the Imam and his followers eschew relations with the outside world it may be assumed that the significance of the phrase escaped them or was regarded as of no p actical importance, in spite of the fact that the Sultan had tried to insert some direct acknowledgement of his suzerainty in the terms of the Treaty. 3, As will be seen this particular aspect of the problem does not directly effect the question of the validity or otherwise of Sa’udi claims to the allegiance of ^tribes on the west of the Sultanate, though the Sultan’s lack of authority, past or present, in those regions adds very much to the difficulty of contesting tneri. 4, Broadly it may be said that the tribes of Dhofar and the majority of the tribes of Sharqiyah and the coastal belt as far. north as about 25°N acknowledge the Sultan, although his authority progressively diminishes towards the north and tne ribes in Ru us al Jibal are virtually independent. The central block 1ro the i Bu Jli in Ja’alan on either side ('■ and 7 ITajar) of a north westerly line stretching to the Jau and ahadhah trac ^s( about 23°6lT 56°E) is under the Imam’s rule though there is a consider able number of tribes which arp ear to owe doubtful or dual allegiance ith the Irani are closely associated the heads of the hinawi ana G-hafiri factions, Salih bin Isa al Harthi and ^ulaim n bin Hamyar, bot' of whom, however, visited the ultan in 1JV , were lavishly entertained and received presents.- 2 - 5 . It is possible, therefore, in the light of all recent evidence to define an approximate western limit to the Imam’s territory and to define it v/ith fair degree of orecision by ignoring the dual allegiance which ray be apparant in the ca e of certain tribes This still leaves a fr nge of 'independent'' tribes between the I main and the Rub ’al hali (Tke Sultan has never been able to define the limits of his own territory in any precise te ms and the line of 1937 'beyond w’ich the Sultan has no claims' is valueless for the purposes of argument \ It is doubtful, however, whether we should le able to ta: e the further step of claiming the Sultan's d^ jure suzerainty over all thejtribes when they are under his own or the Imam's jurisdiction, on the ground that they were all at a distant period under the Sultan and that the Sultan has never renounced his right to their allegiance although, if we do not do so, we have no real rigfct to act on their behalf, I-esort to ancient h:' story immediately adi its the possibili// validity of a’udi claims to im ortant areas, including B' rairni, and it is of little use to ref ex' to the temporary character of ahabi occupation when we are forced to admit much longer periods during which the jultan has had no effective jurisdiction at all, (it is of course arguable that -ahabi inc rsions into the Oman did not at any time alter the legal status of the territory, but this weakens our ground for claiming that Buraimi is the x -cperty if bu Dhabi, unless the Sultan himself is ready to eecog ise bu Dhabi’s succession to that place since the /ahabi retreat in ' 1869 ''. 6. The reluctance of the Imam and of some of his more fanatical followers to admit any form of modernisation is no rore than a partial safeguard. liere there is seen to be a handso e x rofit to be gained the tendency of important tribal, leaders e.g. Sulaiman bin Hauyar) to ignore such consiue at ons and to defect from the Imam will increase. Thus, if we and ti.e Suit.a . refuse officially to recognise the independence of these shaiklis, and at the same time are unable to advance any plausible case for the Sultan* s sovereignty over them we r ay find it very difficult to refute the Su’udi thesis that these outlaying districts are under the control of shaikhs 'not in treaty relations v/ith l .G', t at . }, .G. therefore have no standing there, and that the Su’udi Government is entitled to come to a deject agreement with ihose shaikhs regarding the frontier ( 14 th Oct, 1949) 7. This Sa’udi claim, however, deliberately ignoring the Blue and Violet lines, represents an attempt to ap x ly the conditions of the past to the questions of the present cay; to assume, in fact, that H. ,G. has neither the will nor the right to develop new relations with non-coastal chiefs and that, in consequence, a free field is open to 3a’ud' expansion, wherever it can be shov.Ti that neither '.],G. nor one of their clients has actual authority. This theory blandly ignores the possibility that arrangementsat least as advantageous to the shaikhs as any Ibn 'aud would make 1 ight be made by E.L.G. and that II. . G. is fully entitled to make s' ch ar angements, either as a extension to committments already existing in the Trucial coast or as a corollary to the Treaty with the Sultan, In fact it seei s to be agruable even wfct out the legal argument of the 1913 - 14 Agreements, that, when as Inb ^aud has no standing iththe tribes of Western and N. Western Oman other than that given by an old, temporary occupation of their territory by fares, H.M.G. has, for a much longer period than that conered by the Sa f udi invasions, been the protector and ally of the principal rulers, including the Sultan. The relationship between K.M.G. and these rulers has never been such as to infringe their sovereignty but has been designed to protect their independence in return for undertakings to preserve the maritime peace in the interests of all nationals wishing to trade in the Gulf, and for undertakings not to code or lease territory to others without British consent (see especially Treaty with Muscat of 1391). 8 , It is suggested, therefore, that this formula, clearly applicable to the Trucial Shaikhs and to the Sultan of Muscat, should be applied also to all tribes known to be in friendly relations with the Sultan whether they formally acknowledge his authority or not. From the M Notes on the Tribes of Muscat and Oman* (EA 1019A0) and other sources it is learnt that a large number of Shaikhs have visited the Sultan and received presents of greater or less amount within the last two years. Their districts, tribes and names and as follows:- District Tribe Shaikh Batinah A1 Howasinah Sultan bin Saif 9t Yal Sa'ad Hamad Bin Hilal bin Hamad Western Hajar B.

In the above list have been included only those tribes about which some positive information ('visited Sultan in 1948', 'friendly with Sultan' and the like) is available. Included amongst them are certain tribes whose principal shaikhs have fairly recently visited the Sultan but would not support him in opposition to the present Imam or, on the Imam’s death, support his candidature to the Iraamate. Not included are numerous tribes of the coastal belt which are certainly pro-Sultan, but have not recently been so reported. 10. It is pretty clear from the foregoing that the contention that the Sultan’s real authority is limited to Dhofar and the coastal strip as far north as the Hu’us al Jibal is well founded. ..oreover, irom Thesiger’s and other evidence, the authority of the Ima in the central belt would appear to be at least as well established as that of tne Sultan in territory indisputably under his control. Arguments in favour of talcing a more 'realistic' view of the Sultan’s position have been rejected by Sir E. Hay (Confidential Despatch No.36 of 23th April 1950^ on the ground of the difficulties in which such a policy would land us. His reasoning is unanswerable and it is possible to suggest only that the Sultan should be encouraged to pursue more energetically the forward policy which he is believed already to be undertaking amongst tribes who do not at present acknowledge his rule. But this process is bound to be a slow one and cannot be expected to show any results in time to reinforce our case on his behalf against the Sa’udi claims. These claims in so far as the Oman is concerned, are indefinite and relate to 'shaikhdoms not in treaty relations with His Majesty*s Government'. 11 11. In a note on the Sa’udi claim South and East of Buraimi written on 15th February 1950 I suggested that if Ibn Sa’ud rejected _bu Dhabi’s claim to Buraind (as he now does in the I erorandum of 23rd September 1950 ) we might regard ourselves as free to make such arrangements as appeared desirable to us with the 'independent ' shaikhs. In the light of the tribal information since received I am not sure that such a sug g estion is of any immediate value - certainly not for purposes of negotiation with Ibn Saud.- 5 - 12. The fact is that we have never recognised the existence of 'independent shaikhdoms' other than those with which we have treaty relations, and, if such 'independent shaikhaorns' exist (which we are not prepared to admit) it is clear that, by definition, they are not subjects of Ibn Sa^ud. On the other hand, whatever their actual admin istrative position, the territory which they occupy has always been regarded as part of the domains of the Sultan of Unseat with whom they remain in friendly relations. It would, in fact, as all the evidence shows, be a matter of extreme difficulty to define exactly the boundaries of the territory occupied by such 'shaikhdoms', owing not only to the actual indefiniteness of such tribal boundaries as may be thought to exist but even more to the mixture of tribal sections in the settled part of the country. 13. It is necessary now to see what are the tribes which may claim to be independent, the basis upon which their claim is founded and, so far as it is possible, the district and extent of tneir territory. 14. We should, I think, ignore any claims to independence by Sulaiman bin Hai'yar (E. Riyam) and Salih bin Isa (lUrth) on the dual grounds of their close association with the Imam and their recent visit to the Sultan, which, although they themselves would not admit it, gives good grounds for regarding them as tacitly owing allegiance to him. (Their case, in fact, might be regarded as supporting the theory that, although the Sultan by the Treaty of Sib gave internal autonomy to the Imam he retains his rights of suzerainty which are in x^ractice acknowledged by the Imam’s two principal lieutenants.'' 15. There remain the tribes of the Jau district and the badu’ to the west. The former are the Na*im, the Al bu Shamis, the Bani fa’ab and the Bani Qitab the last two of v/hich have already been noted as being in friendly relations with the Sultan although all four are virtually independent under their own shaikhs. 16. The most recent account (EA 1019/10) of the Fa’im and the Al bu Sharais (which is by origin a division of the Na’im although now separa ted from it by internal feuds) shows that both tribes are vreakened by dissension and have little real unity. They are Wahabi by religion (except one section of the Al bu Shamis) and Sa’udi influence may have increased amongst then recently, but both tribes are lacking in internal cohesion and appear to be territorially dispersed some sections living in what is indisputably Sultanate territory. Thus the effect of Sa’udi influence or attempts to treat them as constituting 'Shaikhdoms' do not seem likely to be very successful. The Sultan’s experiment with the Na’im in 1948 when he is said to have got the section-leaders to sign a document accepting Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan as their tamimah is believed to have lapsed, although it is necessary to note that the reason given is the Sultan’s own lack of supi&gt;ort for the arrangement since Shaikh Saqr started independent negotiations with the Oil Company prospecting in the district (EA 1019/10), a clear indication of his wish to be regarded as independent of the Sultan. It does not neces sarily follow that he would x&gt;ut himself or be able to put his followers under Ibn 3a’ud. 17. The Al bu Shamis are friendly to Abu Dhabi; the ITa’im are not. 18. On the whole, therefore, there would app&gt;ear to be a reasonably good case to be made for regarding all four tribes of the Jau and Dhahirah tracts as certainly independent of the Imam and on terms with the Sultan which justify a claim that they, teclinically at any rate, owe him allegiance, since it will not be in Ibn Saud’s interest to apply the 'religious test.'19 . The ‘badu’ tribes include the V .v/a ir’ 3 the ’Daru’ the 7ahibah and the Qara. 20. The Awardr have numerous small settlements in the Sultanate which acknowledge the Sultan. The bedouin sections which range along the ed'e of the^Kuba’ al I'hali appear to be divided between branches one of which is in Sa’udi „rabia (A 11092) from which a Sau’di claim to the whole of the bedouin sections is likely to arise. Information about the connection between the settled sections in the Sultanate and the t ore easterly bedouin sections is not available but from the account of their wild and lawless habits it seems probable that the tamimah of the settled sections has no influence, and that w’oat cohesion exists amongst the badu is maintained by Shaikh Said:: bin Hamad of ohe Hal Haiw section 'in Sa’udi .xabia' (E 1 IO 9 )• 21. Information about the Daru' (or Duru*) is somewhat conflicting (H IIO 92 and LA 1019/10) but the report in the latter remarks that they are 'at feud with the Wahabis' and that their tamimah visited the Sultan in 19^8. 22. The Wahibah are on good terms with the Sultan and their ta inah visited him in 1948 . 23. The Qata who live on the borders of Dhofar are a wild and primitive people but appear to be well-disposed to tne oultan. 21+. On the whole, therefore, ignoring the rather doubtful case of.tne ’Awamir’ there seem to be good grounds, as far as the desert area is ^ concerned, for regarding the line 'beyond which the Sultan has no claims' as actually representing the approximate limits of the diras of tribes over which the Sultan may claim some measure of control or influence. 25. The position in the Jau district, in which Buraimi lies, in the Hahadhah tract to the north-east of it, the home of the Bani Ila'ab, and in the Dhahirah i mediately south of Jau, is less easy to define. The case for regarding the Buraimi oasis itself as part of Abu Dhabi's territory may fall down owing to opposition from the Sultan. This does not positively advance Sa'udi claims to the place buc naturally.makes a counter-claim more difficult, and it is essential that we decide, before the fact-finding commission starts work, whether we intend to back the claims to Buraimi of abu Dhabi or of the Sultan. 1 suggest that, whatever the reactions of the Sultan may be, we must as part Ox the policy of dealing with the actual conditions and not with vague, remote and temporary historical situations, be prepared 00 baciv the claims of _.bu Dhabi. 26. The effect of doing so may be to alienate the Na'im still.further. The Sultan cannot be expected openly to acquiesce; it would, indeed, be impolitic for him to do so for he would thus encourage others to seek independent arrangements in territory over which iie claims suzerainty and although it involves us in a measure of inconsistency, I suggest that we should support his claims to suzerainty over the other tribes of the Jau, Hahadhah and Dhahirah districts, and, if necessary, over all those whose internal affairs are managed by the Imam. . Definition of the area covered by 'Buraimi' is a task for the fact-finding commission. 27. A tribal map based on BA 1019/10 and a copy of the Treaty of Sib are attached.
