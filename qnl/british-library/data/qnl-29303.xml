Cl) Zanzibar Subsidy - This is an absolute subsidy and used to be paid by H.M.G. and '’Govt of India 1 ’ jointly from 1873 - 1883 when it became an exclusively ”Govt of India' charge. From 1883 onwards the 'Govt of India' continued to pay the whole subsidy, and the last information on the file is dated May 19*6,vide S 33. Details of Book Debits from A.G.C.R. arc not complete here, and according to available information the last payment was for February 1346. However, it is probable that H.H’s account with the Imperial Bank of India Bombay is still being credited, as he would certainly have noticed it had payments ceased. To make sure, may ascertain from A.G.C.R. telegraphically whether this is so and if not to give the date of last payment ? Presumably H.M.G. would now have to accept responsibility for payment of the subsidy ? N.B .(i)The War Subsidy was in addition to the Zanzibar Subsidy, vide file 11/34 vol 3 page 3oo. (ii) The Air Agreement Subsidy 'replaces' the ^ar Subsidy , vide file 2/40 vol 2 S.92 (note on / ArticleArticle 16 of Air Agreement), and (iii) Provision has been made in the 19&lt;±7At8 budget for the Zanzibar Subsidy. lif (2) Arms Su bs idy - The case briefly is that the original subsidy was made to H*H!s. grand father Saiyid Faisal as compensation for loss of revenue arising from his co-operation in the suppression of the Arms Traffic. The present Sultans claim to it was shelved due to the outbreak of hostilities in 1939. H.M.G's. main point is that the subsidy was personal to Saiyid Faisal ana was continued for some years after his death iup to the ena of 1935) as a favour because of the low finances of tnc State. H.H's. contention is that he is entitled to it, as the subsidy was in the nature of a quid pro quo and as such ought not to be discontinued. This case is now liable to be re-opened by the Sultan.

As far back as 1939 the Zanzibar Subsidy of Rs.7,200/- ^IT-' was paid into the account of H.H. with the Imperial Bank of India ( see Si) and later at lAiscat itself, as at page 3* This continued till 1945 when K.h. inade a request that the payment be made once again in India (S 27 ) as was the case before the outbreak of the war. In November last H.H. telegraphed from Salalah asking that the subsidy be paid in Muscat presumably due to the constitutional changes in India, and his request was passed on to P.R. ( S 35 ) for action. Since then considerable correspondence has takin place and upto now nothing has been settled ( please see S 35 et seq ). H.H*s recent request that payment be made in U.K. will probably add more confusion. We may pass on this to P.R. with reference to S 41 ? D.F.A.

The correspondence discusses details of advance payments, refunds, and receipts. Also discussed are details relating to a War Subsidy, to be paid from 1 May 1940 onwards for the duration of the Second World War.Most of the correspondence is between the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat and representatives of the Government of Muscat and Oman (namely the Sultan of Muscat and Oman and, later in the file, the Government of Muscat and Oman's Finance Officer). In addition, there is a small amount of correspondence between the Political Agent, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and officials of the British Government of India.The date range of the volume is 1939-1948; however, most of the material dates from 1939 to 1942, and there is no material from the years 1943, 1944 and 1946. The correspondence concludes in 1948 with arrangements for the handing over of responsibility for the Zanzibar subsidy to His Majesty's Government.The Arabic language material consists of letters to the Political Agent from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd], most of which include English translations.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Muscat and Oman, Finance Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Finance</topic></subject><subject><topic>Subsidies</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000384#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
