BAHRAIN. 25 - 9 - 1944 { P. GULF, ) Telegrams:- “ BABULAL To The PoliticaJ. Agent Bahrain Dear Sir We beg to submit the following points for your kind perusal and favourable consideration. We are a regular shipper of Soudi Arabian dates originating from the port ol Qatif. Every year we ship about fifty to sixty thousand maunds ol these dates to various ports of Western India. As you very well know, that all payments made against the goods purchased in ^oudi Arabia, are always in Indian silver rupees, we used to meet the cost of the purchased goods^by sending silver coins from here But owing to present restrictions on the export of silver coins from Bahrain, we have been faced with an unusualy difficult situation, as regards the payment against the purchases of the goods in question. The otner normal business channel for obtaining money over there was b,y getting dralts from other firms dealing there. But that has also become difficult owing to the very restrictions, refered to above, which have made it difficult for any business firm to keep any money there for purely exchange business,from^hich they can supply us. Hence this line is also closed to ue.* Therefore, we request you, to grant us permission for exporting Indian silver rupee$ x worth one lakh for the present. This amount will not be shipped at one time, but will be exportea piece by piece, in accordance with the needs of the business transactions that may be carried out. We assure you that if the transactions are not carried out to the extent of the permit requested for, we will, in no way misuse your favouring us with the granting of the permit, by shipping any more quantity than actually required. We will be highly obliged, if we are favoured with the granting of our request. Thanking you in anticipation. Yours faithfully.No /S^3. Political Agency, Baliiain, 30th September 1944. To Messrs.
