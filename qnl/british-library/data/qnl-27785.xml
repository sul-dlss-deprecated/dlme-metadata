Walton, Z-**f £ tfyc*/ Under Secretary of state, t^r r 7 ^ ^(3=r Please see previous submission dated 18th Ivay, on P«Z*S3S7/34 oelov^/, and Sir anarevv r^yan's reply to the telegram approved in that paper, on P.z. 3529/34. As will he seen, the minister is rather averse from taking too positive a line with the Saudis, if this can he avoided. 2. The question has been discussed at some length with the Foreign office, who, as a result, have prepared the draft instructions to Sir Andrew Ayan attached. They are inclined to think that ne is at the moment feeling rather tired and that he rather exaggerates the objections to action on the lines proposed by us. Cur position is, of course, (a) that the Saudis having challenged our view in regard to the Blue Line in a written note, we must reassert our position in a written note which would be on record. (b) that we are quite prepared at some later stage to consider a modification of the Blue Line, but that we are in no hurry to go into the matter in any detail, since we should prefer to dispose of the Qatar oil negotiations before doing so. 3. There is no substance in the two points raised by Sir Andrew Ayan in regard to tne Treaty with Ibn Saud* of 1915 and the modification of the Kowelt Frontier in 192,2. As regards the first of these points, it is true that/the treaty in question Iton 3aud undertook to abstain from interference in the territories of Bahrein, Koweit, Qatar and the Shaikhs of the Oman Coast, 'and the limits of their territories shall he hereafter determined' (Articles), and that Article 1 of the same treaty recognised as the territories of Ibn Baud 'Nejd, al Hasa, Qatif and Jubail and their Dependencies and territories which will be discussed and determined hereafter'. But,as the Foreign Office point out in the draft reply now attached, the provisions of this treaty must be read as subject to the status quo, and the status quo, in our view, is represented by the Blue Line of the 1915/14 Conventions. That must be our starting point for any discussion with Ibn 3aud in regard to boundary questions in this area. 4 As regards the Koweit boundary, this is a good example of modification of an existing convention by agreement, and the arrangement reached in 1922 with Ibn/F.Gr.Laithwaite Esq, India Office..'''V 3409/2.79/91 ■ &gt; 0*KA*f* * Sir A- i^yan.

Your teleyrmri No. 95 % I hesitate to delay action on instructions so imperative hut I feel hound to express following views:- (A) Proposed note may have just that provocative effect which Uis Majesty’s Government have wished to avoid. (E) Unless developments in other directions reduce Ihn Baud to extreme weakness or His Majesty’s Government are prepared to use utmost pressure it will he impossible now or later to obtain Saudi Government’s unconditional, recognition of a legal position resulting from agreements with Turks whom Ihn Saud regards less as his predecessors in lav/ful sovereignty than as usurpers. I consider it a material factor that His Majesty’s Government have not insisted in practice during the past twenty years on applicability of Anglo Turkish conventions and that in direct treaty with Ihn Baud in 1915 they agreed to a different basis for determination of his frontiers. I presume you are satisfied that these considerations are of no legal effect hut if they were advanced by Saudi Government they would have at least political importance. I should myself prefer at this stage to explore attitude of Saudi Government in conversation if I could speak frankly (see below). If, however, it is essential to • • •I*1 2. to return inmiediate written reply to their note can we not at least rehut argument based on alleged analogy of Koweit settlement in 1922? Last paragraph of your telegram under reference confirms discretion given me in paragraph 4 of your telegram No. 56.

I HAVE the honour to state that I have received instructions from His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to inform the Government of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, as a matter of courtesy, that the Government of the United States of America have recently asked them for information regarding the treaty basis of the territorial status and boundaries of certain territories and spheres of influence in Eastern Arabia, and have been furnished m reply with copies of the Anglo-Turkish conventions of the 29th July, 1913, and of the 9th March, 1914. I enclose, for convenience of reference, copies of these conven tions, the second of which was ratified and published. It has been pointed out to the United States Government that, while me AnMo-Turkish convention of 1913 was not ratified, the boundaiy iaid down in article 11 of that convention is mentioned, adequately defined and definitely adopted in article 3 of the ratified convention of 1914, which in the view of His Majesty’s Government remains operative. Since article 7 of the convention of 1913 contains provisions regarding the frontier of Koweit, the attention of the United States Government has also been drawn to the subsequent Koweit-Nejd Boundary Convention of the 2nd December, 1922.

Sir andrew Ryan was perhaps more forthcoming than he need have been in tne conversation reported in the latter telegram, hut there is no doubt some difficulty in adopting an entirely rigid attitude in informal discussion witn the Saudi Foreign Minister. 2. The right tactics, for all that, would seem to be to tahe a firm stand on tne legal ana international position about the Blue Line and, whatever tne probability of an ultimate compromise, to give the Saudis no reason at this stage to think either that we regard tne matter as one of no great importance, or that we are not likely to stand on our rights. Para.l of the Foreign Office draft now attached is quite much satisfactory from this point of view. I do not/like the phrase (^without giving them too much mzpe' but it does not perhaps go too far. 3. As regards the Hasa oil concession, it would still/2 still seem tetter to avoia the subject altogether if possible. If, however, the Sauais raise it and hint, e.g., that tne concession actually granted by them in iact extends beyond the Blue Line owing to misunderstandirg on their part, there would be something to be said for making it clear at once that we can recognise no concession beyond the territorial limit in question. But the Foreign draft perhaps goes sufficiently far.. 4. I attach a draft to Ivt. Hendel, for my signature if approved.Hcanza suggests that a concession has in fact been given which extends to the east of the Blue Line, to make it clear that no concession could oe recognised by us save to tne west of that boundary. But the draft pernaps m sufficiently meets the case. J. Q. LA1THWAITE.(K 2774/279/91) OFFICE. S.W.l.

I think he meant Sikak though he was not himself sure of this. He spoke also of Ibn Baud’s relations with trucial Sheikhs especially the Sheikh of Qatar who was the King’s bosom friend and with whom the King had every sort of tie. Fuad added that he had himself warned the King of effect of Sheikh’s Treaty with His Majesty’s Government. His general line was that Ibn Saud was very willing to respect British sphere and saw some advantage in having His Majesty’s Government between him and the Sheikhs though he might for Arab reasons prefer some definition of position different from that now in force.

Jeddah* Your telegram of the 28th ultimo, I consider it most adrisable that Sheikh should he informed in writing of this important matter which affects him closely {? sMm If given merely orally, he will be almost certain to ask for confirmation by letter as he did for His Majesty S s G-oTOrnmsnt 9 s previous intimation, see paragraph 2, my telegram T 98* Moreover, as Ihn Saud will have already been informed in writing, is there any harm in informing the Sheikh {corrupt group)? 2. If you concur, communication to Sheikh, which could be sent by loch to him together with that mentioned in paragraph FOo 4 S m telegram of the 30th ultimo, 435, might take the following form; n 'I am directed by the Political Resident to inform you that His Majesty 5 s Government hare intimated to His Majesty Xbn Saud that the eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia is bounded by a blue line drawn due south from Zaklmunia, The area between the blue line and your frontier, which you indicated to the Resident on his recent ^iait to Katr, will be a British sphere of influence. If you wish the matter explained further, this can be done when the Resident or I can next visit you*”r MAY mi Decypher 1st May 5 1934 Do 8,30 let May, 1934 R 0 11.5 p d m c 1st May, 1934 No* 85 My telegram No*82* Fuad represented King as feeling injured and apprehensive as to jmpression that would he created that general policy of His Majesty’s G-overnment was turning against him* He would not admit that this was the King’s own impression hut that is of course the probability we have to reckon with. The King had told him to repeat asseverations of his own friend and to refer to following reasons for apprehension:- (1) Penzance visit to Medi (2) British mission to Sanaa (3) Failure of His Majesty*s Government to give him the lead which he hoped for when taking them into his confidence at all stages of his quarrel with Imam. (4) Press reports that His Majesty’s Govern ment did not wish him to conquer Yemen lest he should refuse to abide by Anglo-Yemeni treatyo (5) Appearance of suspicion in regard to protection of British subjects e 0 go at Medi. ( 6 ) Blue line note* I dealt with (1) and (5) on lines indicated in telegram under reference 0 Fuad himself admitted that (2) had been completely explained. (3) ms merely preamble to (4) and 1 ignored it. As regards (4) Fuad conveyed King’s assurance as from now that if he becamebecame ruler of Yemen lie would observe agreement with Imam in regard to Aden protectorate. I sold I knew nothing of press reports referred to and was sure that His Majesty's Government had not entertained any suspicions for the simple reason that they had not envisaged Saudi conquest of Yemen as a practical &gt; possibility. As regard ( 6 ) see my telegram No.83. I attach little Importance at present to these references to possibility of overrunning Yemen. Fuad spoke in the same conversation of prospect of early settlement of constitutional basis of King's demands being effectively satisfied. Rulers appear to be still in correspondence and Abdullah Nazir reached Mecca yesterday. Situation might be complicated if Xbn Saud now pressed for an indemnity but I have heard no hint of this here,, Fuad sounded me as from himself e,s to whether His Majesty's Government might not proclaim their neutrality and issue Order in Council, i fenced tills. What line should I take if he should revert to it?

I have no comments on programme t© add &gt;to paragraph 3 of my telegram No. 71. I am still nervous about Sikak which seems to be very close to line between Khor A 1 Odaid and Salwa. Standard Oil Company of California map puts it at a perpendicular distance of four miles south of straight line joining southern extremity of Dohat as Salwa to northermost point of Khor A 1 Odaid. Fuad referred more than once in conversation yesterday to my note of April 28th, I gather Ibn Saud is perturbed and suspects that attitude of His Majesty^ Government in regard to this and other matters may indicate adoption of new general policy adverse to him. He also seems anxious to placate us and Fuad indicated in general terms readiness on King's part to discuss amicably question of his eastern boundaries. Fuad obviously had instructions to discuss my note more expressly but there was no time yesterday and he has had to cancel further interview arranged for today owing to indisposition. He is returning to Mecca instead. Addressed to the Foreign office No. 85, repeated to India No. 25, Bushire No* 79..... m*. m. onr-w »» “A CO* 2888 1934 1 dkt/prb/cwp/dia.

This is as follows Prom approximately Husn Murad to the Wadi Bana it is identical with the old demarcated Anglo-Turkish boundary as shown on official maps of the Aden Protectorate. Prom the demarcated point on the Wadi Bana, eastwards, it follows tribal boundaries which have never been demarcated in detail on the ground, and which the inaccuracy of existing maps makes it impossible to define precisely on paper, but which are known to the tribes concerned. These are the northern and eastern boundary of the Upper Yafa tribe, excluding Rubeiatein, the boundaries between the Upper Yafa, Lower Yafa and Fadhli tribes, and Beidha, the north western and northern boundary of the Audhali tribe, the western boundary oi the Aulaqi tribe, and the western and north-western boundary of Beihan, including the Masabi country.

Conventions, of 29th July 1913, and 9 th March 1914, respectively, which inter alia cover the matter® 3® The 1913 Convention was never ratified, but you will see that the boundary line laid down in Article 11 of it was re-defined and formally adopted in Article 3 of the 1914 Convention, the ratifications of which were exchanged in London on 3rd June of that year. 4* The frontier between Saudi Arabia and the British spheres of influence in South Eastern Arabia is thus a line running from the head of the bay immediately to the south of Zajnuniya Island, a little to the east of Uqair, in a due southerly direction to a point on parallel 20° North in the middle of the Ruba al Khali desert, and thence running south-westwards, at an angle of 45°, down to the frontier between the Aden Protectorate and what is now the territory of the Imam of the Yemen* King Ibn Saud has of course succeeded to Turkish sovereignty on the west and north-west of that line, Saudi Arabia being one of the Turkish succession States* 5* The prohibition in regard to flights of aircraft, to which we have already made reference inthe official correspondence about the Company^ request for facilities for their aeroplane at Bahrain, applies of course to the area to the east and south-east of the above line; and, if you think there is any likelihood of the California- Arabian Standard Oil Company's survey of their concession (as to the precise area of which I understand no informatior has yet been published) extending to the vicinity of the boundary referred to above, we should be grateful if you would make sure that they are informed of the position, in order that there may be no danger of their aircraft unwittingly violating the prohibition of flying to the east of/of the 'boundary, or of their inadvertently extending their operations in any way to the east of that line* Yours, &amp;e*, (Sgd*) G.W.

Addition of rider suggested in penultimate para- grapn of your telegram No.47 (of March 30th) to effect that United States request is understood to have been made in order to ascertain limits of Saudi territory and British sphere of influence, seems open to serious objection. Correspondence with United States Embassy in Angora enclosed in my despatch No.122 (of March 22nd) shows that it would not be accurate to represent United States enquiry as having been made with this specific purpose. Moreover communication in this sense might; be aimost as provocative as that discussed in paragraph 7 (c) of my telegram No,36 (of March 27th) and open to similar objectionoo 3, You should therefore unless you see serious objection, address formal note to Saudi Government informing them, as mere matter of courtesy, that United States Government have asked for information regarding the treaty basis of territorial status and boundaries5^ yv'? boundaries of certain territories and spheres of influence in Eastern Arabia, and m reply have been furnished by His Majesty Government with copies of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of July 29th, 1915 and of March 9th, 1914, You should attach copies of these Conventions for the information of the Saudi Government, explaining that that of March 9th, 1914, was larilied and published. The note should continue on the lines of paragraph S of my despatch N o.125 (of March 22nd) to Angora, making clear that His Majesty's Government regard the 'blue line' laid down in Article 11 of the 19:1,5 Convention and defined and adopted in Article 5 of the ratified convention of 1914, as remaining operative.

The draft is identical with that approved by the Secretary of State on P.Z.2448/34, with the exception that para.5 has been omitted. This is immaterial. The Foreign Office j also covers a draft of a comnunication to the American Embassy here on the lines referred to in the previous submission. The terms of this are satisfactory. Since receipt of tne Foreign Office letter ! we have had an expression of the Government of India’s views and there has been correspondence, both official and demi-official, with them. They agree as to the advantages of course (b) and they also* now agree, in tne light of demi-official telegraphic correspondence, to withdraw their objection to a reconnaissance in the event of the Departments concerned being satisfied as to its desirability. 'There is thus nothing between us ana tnem. 2* Attention snoula also be drawn at this stage to sir Andrew Iran's telegram No.64 of 18th April, whicn suggests the possibility of deal ing with the present issue onratner different lines, by means of a comprehensive communication to Bin Saud which would reier not only to the position of tne Blue Line, but to the Koweit Blockade and the Koweit Neutral Zone. a letter just received from the Political Resident shows that the sheikh of Koweit has still certain demands to make, which it may be difficult to grant, | as a term of agreeing to aoandon his pecuniary claims— .... ■ •- '■ — - 2 - . ‘ on Bin Saud, and it is odvious that soma little delay will be inevitable before progress can be maae over this point.

Embassy at Angora, that we propose to maintain the Blue Line as against him. The Foreign Office departmentally agree that in these circumstances no progress is possible on the lines suggested by Sir A. Ryan and they are asking approval to reply to him accordingly. The other Middle East Departments are, I understand demi-officdaily, aispos&lt;jd to the same view. It is unnecessary in these circumstances to hold up disposal of the present drafts. 4.

We are unable therefore to support recommendations made in paragraphs 5 and 5 of Bowie's telegram.jrjm. Banger of encroachments referred to by Bowie will, of course, remain, but we do not consider that course ( 0 ) i s any -re likely than (b) to put a stop to them.

Atmosphere may now be clouded by latest Royal slave incident and no question can be considered without taking account of Saudi Yemen situation which may be developing more rapidly than seemed likely three weeks ago. If ^cn Saud wins in conflict with Iman in which His Majesty's Government have done nothing material to help him, he will be encouraged to resist our claims in eastern Arabia. He may be all the readier to do so.t’m - t-nns i E conjectural, as a result of the establishment of direct contact with Arab leaders taking part in mission of mediation now here, if he is worsted by Iman he will think His Majesty's Government are taking advantage of his difficulties to embark on forward policy on eastern side of his dominions.

Sir John Simon will be glad to be informed as soon as possible whether the Secretary of State for India concurs in the terms of this draft. 2. With regard to Conclusion fiii), Sir John Simon considers that the best way of making a further communication to the United States Government on the subject of the South Eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia will be to deal with the matter in an informal letter to the Secretary of the United States Embassy who originally raised with this department the question of the proposed emergency flights to Earhain of the Standard Oil Company’s aircraft on the Hasa coast.

We have instructed our Embassy to put yours on the track of the relevant agreements. 2, It has occurred to us th&amp;t the enquiry of your Embassy at Angora may well have been made in connexion with the C&amp;lifomia-Ar&amp;bitin standard Oil Company's concession and proposed aircraft survey, T/hether that be so or not, it has suggested'suggested to us that, since we have been in &gt; 00rreSPOndence on the Object of the Company' aircraft, and you may not have had the opportunity of obtaining full information to the boundary between Saudi Arabia and the area under British influence to the south-east of it, you may like to hove the enclosed copies of two Anglo-Turkish Conventions, of 29th July, 1913, and 9th March, 1914, respectively, which Inter alia cover the matter. 3, The 1913 Convention was never ratified, hut you will see that the boundary line laid down in Article 11 of it was re-defined and formally adopted in Article 3 of the 1914 Convention, the ratifications of which were exchanged in London on 3rd June of that year. 4. The frontier between Saudi Arabia and the British spheres of influence in South Eastern Arabia is thus a line running from the head of the bay immediately to the south of Saknuniya island, a little to the east of Uqair, in a iue southerly direction to a point on &gt;arallel 20 ° ‘Worth in the middle of the Rub a /i&lt;uba al Khali desert, and thence running south-westwards, at an angle of 48°, down to the frontier between the Men Protectorate and wnat Is now the territory of the imam of the Yemen. ftlng Xtn Saud has of course succeeded to Turkish sovereignty on the west and north west of that line, Saudi Arabia being one of the Turkish succession states. 8 . The prohibition In regard to flights of aircraft, to which we have already made reference in the official correspondence about the Company's request for facilities for their aeroplane at Bahrain, applies of course to the area to the east and south-east of the above line; and, if you think there is any likelihood of the Callfornia-Arabian Standard Oil Company's survey of their concession (as to the precise area of which l understand no information has yet been published) extending i.o the vicinity of the boundary referred to above, we should be grateful if you would make sure that they are Informed of the position, In order'''N order that there may be no danger of their aircraft unwittingly violating the prohibition of flying to the east of the boundary , or of their inadvertently extending their operations in any way to the east of that line.253] 5000 2.3-1 Draft Paper.

In the course of my conversations during my visit to you on the 11th and 12th of March 1934, you, OS Shaikh, stated that you had made certain arrangements with His Majesty King Bin Sa’ud. When I asked you what these arrangements were you refused to inform me. I informed the High British Government of this and they have instructed me to draw your attention to the fitst part of Clause IV of the Treaty between you and the High British Government dated the 3rd November 1916, in which you undertook that you would not have relations nor^ corr- -espond with any other fower v/ithout the consent of the High British Government; and the High British Government have also instructed me to inform you that by making these arrangements with His Maj esty King Bin Sa 9 ud you have broken the terms of the Treaty and that the High British Government are very displeased at this; further that any arrangements made cannot be permitted to continue. The High British Government have authorised me to inform you that in the circumstances which I have explained to you, they are prepared to give your pro- -tection on land, in addition to the protection on sea which is already given to you.2 M2 X also reminded you in our a&gt; co nversations on the nth and 12th March that according to the terms V of the Treaty you should not give any concess any concession with* of Clause -out the permission of the High British Government. To tais you replied that if any Company other than the Anglo Persian OH Company were to apply to you for permisssion * to make a survey of your territory, you considered that it was within your right to grant that permission, and that, if after such Company had mace the survey, they were to ask for a concession, you would then ask pennies- -ion from the High British Government to give it to them. I have been instructed by the High British Government to inform you that they consider that such a survey would be part and parcel of a concession and that therefore you are not at liberty to give/ permission for a survey. In the course of our conversations, with regard to your arrangements with His Majesty King Bin Sa'ud you did not say what these arrangements were, but you stated that if you did not keep up these relations you feared that there would be serious trouble with the Bedouin, In case of such trouble, hov/ever, as X have informed you you can rely on the protection on land which I have mentioned above. I have now made clear the position and have informed you, 0!

Their recoKmendaUons are also flagged. A separate submission (travelling herewith) has been made on their proposal to approve Colonel Powle’s action and the suggested reconnaissance. The present submission deals solely with the line to be taken vis-a-vis Ibn saud am the U.s. Government on the question of the Eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia. 2 ’ It wil1 be remembered that at their meeting on torch the Middle East committee recommended that H.M.G. should take their stand on the Blua Line of the 1913-14 Ahglo-Turkish conventions as the Eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia (see Secretary of State's telegram to the Government of India No.817 of 27th torch on P.2.2013/34 flagged), and that the question of what if any communication should be made to Ibn Saud in order to make this clear should be further considered with sir A. pyan. Reference is invited on this point to Foreign Office telegram No.36 of 27th March to sir A. Ryan which was drafted in consultation with this Department,and which sets out the advantages and disadvantages of the various courses of action clearly. 3 * Sir A. Ryan has now replied (Jedda telegram No.47 of 30th torch, on P.z.2227/34 flagged). He is in favour of an immediate but anodyne communication to the Saudis, and agrees that a suitable peg is afforded by the recent enquiry by the U.s. Embassy at Angora about the 1913 Convention. 4/4. colonel Fowls has separately intimated that l|e regards an immediate warning to Ihn Saud as most desirable (Para. ? of his telegram of 5th April, T.98). 5 . The Middle East Conmittee in the light of the views of Sir A- Kyan and the Resident agreed to recommend in im adiate act ion at Jedda vis-a-vis Ibn„Saud | on the lines referred to in para.3 above. For the reasons given in the Foreign Office telegram to Jedda of which an advance draft is attachea, they aia not however favour the formula suggested by the Minister. Sir A. Ryan in his telegram No. 47 of 30th March drew attention however to the danger that the Hasa Oil Company, who were now using an aeroplane for Survey purposes, might well operate to the East of the Blue Line. After consultation with Mir. Walton, I I urged in the meeting that this danger was a real one* and suggsstxGd in siddidion t/O iirniiGdia/ts a.ct»ion Jedda, we should make a demarche to the U.S. Embassy here. The fact that we had been in correspondence with the Embassy as to the conditions on which the Hasa Company's aeroplane might visit Bahrein afforded a peg. The Middle East Committee agreed as to the desirability of a supplementary cormamication to the U.S. Government , the Foreign Office to decide whether in London or in Washington. As will be seen from thei draft attached, they have accepted our view that the communication should be made here, though the Washington Embassy should take any suitable opportunity of reinforcing it. 7. The draft prepared by the Foreign Office to give effect to the conclusions of the Middle East Committee is, f think, generally suitable, and I submit that, subject to the concurrence of higher authority in the Foreign Office, and of the other3 2119 5000 8/33 Minute Paper. Department. Middle mast Committee Departments, to which it is oeing referred, we may concur in it. 8 .. It will be appreciated that the question of the mustern boundary of Saudi Arabia, and the proposed communication to ibn Saud, raises an issue ol very considerable political importance, ibn Saud iaced with so definite a challenge to his authority and position in Central Arabia, is not unlikely to take the strongest exception to our claims (though his reaction, so far as can be judged, will be through the diplomatic channel). Moreover, once having staked out our claim, we must 'be prepared to maintain it, or, if we see advantage in making some small concession to him later to save his face and in the interests of a settlement, we should do so only after leisurely negotiation. We are in a strong position legally . Our position is less strong practically » since neither we nor our Arah clients in fact exercise very effective control in the desert hinterland of Central Arabia, and such informal | authority as is exercised there is exercised by Ibn Saud. Politically it is essential to face the issue with him (both Sir A. ityan and Colonel Powle agree). If we do not, we shall find him consolidating his position along the Arab coast of the Gulf, which strategically; because of air and oil developments; j and because of increasing international interest in it, it is of great importance to us to control. The I value of successfully maintaining the Blue Line, or 1 some slightly modified version of it, against Ibn Saud, will/ **£***/ .b.S*it will not merely te in the check which/will represent to his extension East: our attitude will he known all along the Arab coast, and should considerably strengthen our position in Koweit, Bahrein, Qatar and the irucial Area* u , ait 7 nUnited States Embassy in Angora enclosed in my despatch lo. 122 ,/of March 2g7 that it would not he strietly accurate to represent United States enquiry as having been mAde with this specific purpose.

(Paper No. M.E.(O) 126). MR. LAI IOTA ITE stated that there w r ere two questions for discussion. Firstly, the present position of the negotiations with the Sheikh, and, secondly, the question of the boundary, i.e., the 'blue line'. The Sheikh’s redactions were fully given in Colonel Fowle’s telegram (Paper No. M.S.(O) 124) and his air mail letteis (Paper No. M.E.(O) 126). The general line taken Py the Resident seemed entirely satisfactory. If the Committee agreed as to this, we might approve it specifi cally, and might also consult Colonel Fowle as to the next stage, it seemed desirable to maintain our pressure on the Sheikh, since a further telegram had just been received from Colonel Fowle that a reliable report had been received Py the Political Agent, Bahrein, that the Hasa Oil Company had informed the Sheikh that they would cap any financial offer made by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and that the Sheikh had replied that he would not negotiate with them until the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s option expired.enqaired as to the precise nature of this option. if the exploration licence which the Anglo- Persian Gil Company at present held really amounted to an option - and it ./as difficult to see what value it possessed unless at gave the Company preferential rights for obtaining a concession if they found oil - might it not be possible to ±ine tas Sh eikh that he was already committed t,.n,ab of this option to giving the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company if they desired to take it up. fir. laithwaite and Kr. Parkinson having explained that exploration licences in India and in Palestine did in fact give the holders preferential claims amounting to options on the concessions concerned, Hr. Rendel thought that these precedents might furnish a useful argument for taking the line with the Sheikh that he could not grant the concession to any other Company until the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had decided whether to take up the concession or not. The fact that we were now telling the Sheikh that we regarded an e -APloration licence as part and parcel of a concession might be a further argument in favour of this line. ! ST I ON OP fJB LINE' NpAHY. At Mr ’' Laithwaite’s suggestion it was agreed that Colonel o,,L,dl„, be informed that his action was approved, subject to any caveat that might be necessary in the light of further discussion in the Committee as to the Qatar boundary. On the question of the attitude to be adopted with Ibn Sand over the 'blue line' HR. LAITHTvAITE stated that Sir Andrew Ryan appeared to agree with the course indicated in paragraph 7(b) of the Foreign Office telegram to Jedda No- S6 01 b,th karen l circulated as Paper No. H.E. (0) ICC), i. e . , to/ anodj/n-- communication to Ibn Gaud which would make our posi tion clear without constituting a direct challenge. The minister considered it dangerous to say nothing, and-3- undesirable to say anything provocative. A tactful communication to Ibn Saud of the United States Snibassy’s request for copies of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 on the lines discussed at the Sub-Committee's last meeting was thus apparently the best course. The India Office wished, however, to suggest a parallel communication to the United States Smbassy in London with a view to countering the danger, strongly emphasised by Sir A. Ryan, of the possibility of air survey being carried oul by the Standard Oil Company of California to the east of the 'blue line'. The Standard Oil Company naa recently asked, and obtained, permission, through the -ore^gn Office, to use Bahrein for flying purposes in the even„ of emergency. He suggested, subject to Foreign Office agreement, that in connection with this permission, the American Embassy should be asked to ensure that air- -rcut belonging to the Standard Oil Company should not cross the eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia, i.e., the 'blue line u * '■-A. REKDEL said that at first sight he was much attracted by Mr. Laithwaite's suggestion. The possible desirability of making a further communication to the United States Government on the subject of the 'blue line', and not merely relying on the United States Embassy at Angora to pass on our views, had already occurred to him, bat it would obviously be.preferable to find some such peg as that which Mr. Laithwaite had suggested - i.e. the correspondence about the Standard Oil Company’s aircraft - on which to hang such a further communication. At the I-*-, tho voiding of the communication would need very carefully working out. The United States Embassy had asked for permission for the aircraft (a) to fly to Hasavia K owe it and Bahrein, and (h) to make direct from Hasa to Bahrein in cases of emergency. Neither application involved any real risk of the aircraft flying east of the *11116 line, and it might possibly he prefer able to address about the 'blue a warning to the united States Government 1ine', through His Majesty's Embassy in Washington, with reference to the enquiry of the United States Embassy in Angora, and not to link it on to the question of the aeroplane. In any case he would like to consult the American Department of the Foreign Office and submit the matter to his higher authorities before going any further; but he saw r no reason why something on the lines suggested by Mr. Laithwaite should not be done. THE CHAIRMAN suggested that the question of whether the communication was made here or at Washington was a matter for the Foreign Office. It was accordingly agreed that a supplementary communication should be made to the United States Govern ment, to the effect that aircraft of the Standard Oil Company could not fly to the east of the ?! blue line', and that the method of this communication should be decided by the Foreign Office. MSTRUCTIONS 3 HIS US STY’S INISTEP, IDEA. The question of what instructions should be sent to Sir Andrew Ryan was then discussed. MR. SEAL thought it would be very difficult in practice to tie down Ibn Saud within any definite geographical limits. Ibn Saud had, in fact, expanded to the East of the 'blue line'. We should, therefore, con fine ourselves to our main object of reserving our oil rights in this area, sir Andrew Ryan 9 inhis telegram No, 54 had drawn attention to the inappropriateness of the European conception of ^ a xrontier to conditions in remote parts of Arabia. He therefore did not like the addition to com se (b) suggested oy Sir A. Ryan in his telegram No, 47, which involved the phrase ff limits of Saudi territory’'. Tne ’’blue line” was, of course, legally the limit of Saudi territory, but he felt that it would be impossible to check the extension of Bin Saud f s influence over the tribes by talking to him about a ’’blue line”, although it might be possible to prevent him giving an oil concession. ME. IAITHEAITE felt some doubt about the terms of the addition suggested by Sir Andrew Ryan. The less surface we exposed the better s iHE CHAIRMAN preferred to retain the original wording of tlie inst ructions given to Sir Andrew Ryan, vide paragraph 7(b) of M.E e (0) 122, which was$~ - co some action which would make our views and position clear to Ibn Saud without constituting ci direcb challenge to his position. This could be done by merely informing him of the United States Embassy's request for copies of the Anglo-Turkisn Conventions of 1913 and 1914 and of our reply. Diplomatic discussions could then be allowed to take their course and question could if necessary be considered of what concessions could be made to Ibn Saud”, MR, RENDER said that, while he was naturally most reluctant to question the recommendation of the man on the spot, it must be remembered that when Sir Andrew Ryan sent his telegram No. 47 of March 30th (M.EA(O) 125) he haa not yet received copies of the correspondence with His Majesty’s Embassy at Angora regarding the United States Embassy s request for information* When Sir Andrew-5- Ryan received that correspondence he would see that it was not quite accurate to say that the United States request was understood to have 'been made in order to ascertain the limits of Saudi territory 1 * etc. The explanations which Sir Loraine had now been instructed to give to the United States Embassy would make the position abundantly clear; and 5 in the circumstances, Mr 0 Eendel agreed that it would be better not to add the rider suggested in the penultimate paragraph of Sir Andrew*Ryan*s telegram, more especially as such a statement might well be regarded as unnecessarily provocative. MR* LAITHTAITE said that as regards the point raised by Mr, Seal, the ’blue line 5 ’was our sole legal boundary and it was for this reason that it was important to take our stand on it. If we abandoned the ’blue line', our position in regard to which was internationally and legally strong, the boundary position as between us and Ibn Saud became entirely fluid and our bargaining position would be much ■weaker. If we took our stand on theblue line” it would immensely strengthen our position in challenging any attempt by Ibn Saud either to grant an oil concession or to take other active measures to the east of it. In reply to Colonel Mackesy, Mr. Laithwaite said that the payments mentioned in Colonel Fowlers letter of the 30th March 1934 (M a E 3 (0) 126), referred in terms to those made by Arab rulers and not by the inland nomad tribes. From Colonel Fcwle f s letter it was obvious that these payments were in no way a formal tribute and carried no recognition of sovereignty by the persons by whom the payments were made, but were in the nature of the ancient Danegelt or the modern blackmail. It appeared fromthe extracts appended to the India Office memorandum on the southern boundary of Qatar that the Hurrah and other nomad tribes of the Rub ’al Khali paid occasional tribute to Ibn Saud as 'Lord of the Sands'; but it was clear that this too was not of a formal or necessarily of a permanent character. THE CHAIRMAN thought that as it was obviously im possible to provide for every contingency, the less that was said the better. MR. RENDER agreed, and suggested that Sir Andrew Ryan should be instructed to inform Ibn Saud, as a mere matter of courtesy, of the United States Governments enquiry re garding the Convention of 1913, and of the reply returned by His Majesty’s Government thereto, making it clear that His Majesty’s Government regard the 'blue line' laid down in the 1913 and 1914 Conventions as remaining operative. It was accordingly agreed that the Foreign Office should draft a telegram conveying instructions on the above lines to Sir Andrew Ryan. MR, LAITHWAITE stated that Sir Samuel Hoare, subject to the views of Departments, agreed with the Political Resident as to the desirability of a combined reconnaissance by the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force taking place as soon as possible. He recognised, however, that no reconnaissance could take place until the communication about the 'blue line' to Ibn Saud and the United States Embassy had been made. The object of the reconnaissance would be two-folds firstly, to ascertain the general nature of the country and to look for possible landing grounds for aircraft and anchorages for flying boats:secondly, a combined reconnaissance by naval and air craft would impress the Sheikh and was likely to have a strong moral effect, GOM'lA.NDER DICKSON stated that the East coast of the Qatar Peninsula was generally accessible to sloops; it was, however, impossible for these vessels to re connoitre the West coast of the Qatar Peninsula owing to the inadequacy of the present surveys* CROUP CAPTAIN PECK stated that aircraft frequently flew across the Qatar Peninsula, which coincided with a section of the eastern air route. He considered that it would be very useful to obtain further information regarding the Dohat as Salwa, which could be done without Admiralty assistance. This reconnaissance could be linked up with the presence of any of His Majesty f s ships on the east coast, in order to show the flag at Doha and the more densely habited part of the country. Should it be decided tohoHa reconnaissance, he suggested that the Resident of the Persian Gulf should be asked to work out the necessary arrangements in conjunction with the Air Officer Commanding Iraq, and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, MR, RENDEL suggested that it would be well that the reconnaissances if made should be made as soon as possible after the communication to Ibn Saud of our views regarding the f, blue line 1 ', but before Ton Saud had had time to take up the challenge. If the reconnaissances were made before we had said anything to Ibn Saud about our views in regard to the frontier, he might well make a grievance of having had no warning of our attitude, while if they were made after he had taken up our challenge (should he do so) they might be regarded as a hostiledemonstration and lead to political difficulties. MR, IA1111¥AITE agreed to the importance of action as soon as the necessary communication had teen made at oeada. On the question of protection, he pointed out that our liability to protect the Sheikh of -latar did not become effective until and unless a concession was granted to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, GROUP CAPTAIN PECK said that the Air Ministry con templated the establishment of an aerodrome at Doha and various emergency landing grounds in the Qatar peninsula, to enable them to fulfil the guarantee of protection to ti^e Du.eikh, if granted. Prior to the provision of the detence facilities required in Qatar, it would be necessary to base any landplsnes used for reconnaissance on Bahrein, It was accordingly agreed that the India Office should include in their telegram to the Resident at the xersian Guli instructions regarding the proposed recon naissance. alm, LAIInwAITE said that subject to the concurrence ol Departments, the India Office w r ould address a telegram to the Resident at the Persian Gulf, to be repeated to tii.e Government of India, covering the following heads;- (a) General approval of his action, with any caveat necessary as regards the boundary question, crooS reference to the telegram which the foreign Office would, he understood, draft to Jedaa, and which would explain the position as regards trie intimation to be conveyed to Ibn Saud* .(c) Reconnaissance; (a) An enquiry as to the time table he contemplated vis-a-vis the Sheikh, and the next step. enquired what, ii any, caveat snould be included He-9- in such instructions on the subject of the Qatar boundary 0 MR. RENDER favoured some such caveat as he feared that if we allowed the Sheikh 1 s statement that his frontier ran across the base of the peninsula to pass in silence, we might be regarded as having acquiesced in such a frontier, and that might make it difficult for us eventually to claim that the n intermediate area' up to the 'blue line' 'appertained' to Qatar. It would never do for us to say to Ibn Saud that w r e regarded the territory up to the 'blue line' as falling within the sphere of Qatar and for Ibn Saud to be able to reply that the Sheikh of Qatar himself repudiated any such claim MR. lAITMWAITE suggested that the desirability of some caveat should be put to the Resident for his views. This was agreed. ONISTERIAL v UTHORITY . COLONEL MACKESY stated that the communication of our attitude to Ibn Saud might involve important re actions, Up till now r we had been in the stage of exploration, obtaining the views of Sir Andrew Ryan, Colonel Fowle and others. Now w ? e had reached the time for definite action and he therefore suggested that some statement, giving the conclusions of the Sub-Committee should be prepared for circulation to the members of the Ministerial Sub-Committee, THE CHAIRMAN said that he understood that the telegrams resulting from the conclusions of the last meeting had been approved both by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for India; the drafts had been sent to other Departments, who had given their concurrence. It was, of course, incumbent on departmental representatives to consult•10' their Ministers if they saw fit, in the matter of such drafts which came to them for concurrence a Should any Minister feel doubt, he could suggest that tne matter be referred to the Ministerial Sub-Committee„ He thought tuat it would meet the case, so far as concerned the tele grams to Sir Andrew Ryan and Colonel Powle, which would be prepared as the result of this meeting, if the drafts were referred o f 11 cially to the other Departments con cerned for concurrence.

Whatever parents may be made are in the nature of the ancient Panegsld or the modern black-mail. The Shaikhdoms of the Gulf impinge to a greater or less degree, except in the case of Kuwait there are no demarcated frontiers, on Saudi territory, and Ibn Saud by stirring up his border tribes, and in various other ways, can make himself a nuisance to his Shaikhly fceighbours. The latter have to look after themselves, since only in the case of Kuwait are we committed to defending them by land , and take the line of least resistance by paying him - Ibn/ J.G.Laithwaite Esquire, The India Office, London.rbn Sand - 'blackmail, which flatters Ms vanity and fills Ms pocket.

I /doubt whether Ibn Baud would appear definitely troublesome in the interior of Sheikhdoms or seek, except in the case of Qatar, to acquire direct and dominant infiuence/over Sheikhs. He might perhaps cultivate closer friendly relations with the latter He would almost certainly pursue not less actively than before policy of securing adhesion of tribes in hinterland like Hurra and Manasir though I doubt whether he would attempt new Ikhwan. settlements having regard to failure of those at Sikak and Anbak. It would be useful to know whether he still maintains emorts at Baraimi, See Persian Gulf administration reports for 1929 and 1930 and compare Philby’s (?paper ) 5 the Quarterly, pages 28 &amp; 77 c Greatest danger of all, however, is possible extension of survey work of Standard Oil Company of California east of blue line. They now have an aeroplane and I believe they have just obtained, not without difficulty, Ibn Baud’s permission to bring it into use in the near future.

They will presumably pass on this information to the Standard Oil Company of California* who will thus have no excuse for regarding their concession from Ibn Sard as giving them any rights east of that line* 3 0 Moreover if any limit is to be put to the extension or consolidation of Ibn Saud's inlormally exercisea authority towards the east and risk is to oe avoioed of his gradually establishing a claim to the hinterland* and even to the coastal Qistricts of the Arab territories in special relations with His Majesty’s Government* ”blue line” affords only valio, and legal basis for any boundary at all between British and Saudi spheres in south-eastern Arabia* Question may au any moment become acute owing to oil or air developments, and objections to leaving it indeterminate any longer are there- 'ore serious© -p0 6« 2, 4* On the other hand, while this issue may in any event have to he faced before long, His Majesty’s Government are reluctant to risk unnecessarily provoking a major dispute vath Ibn Baud, particularly when he is already in difficulties with the Imam of Yemen, Moreover if, as a result of such a challenge to his position, Ibn Baud, while outwardly maintain ing friendly relations, were to endeavour to stir up desert tribes against the E&gt;heikhs of Qatar or (less probably) Abu Dhabi, the resulting' situation might be difficult, since His Majesty's Government, while under no formal obligation to defend them by land, might have to consider lending them assistance. Pending completion of the necessary organisation in Qatar (which must await general agreement with the Sheikh about oil concession and proposed guarantee of protection) this would be most difficult. There is also danger that Ihn Saud, when faced with possihility of having to accept blue line might intrigue to strengthen his informal influence in Qatar or the trucial Sheikhdoms, Possibility must false not be overlooked that Ihn Saud might react to challenge by intensifying his impenetration of hinterland of Qatar and tracial Sheikhdoms - e.g. hy creation of further Akhwan settlements or by asserting his supremacy over desert tribes, although we might be in a stronger position diplomatically m regard to this if we had previously made our view of his eastern boundary clear to him as suggested in paragraph 7o ■below* 5 , It is impossible from here to estimate importance or reality of these dangers, but it seems desirable to examine them fully in order to leave no possiole factor out of accoun8. 5 6 a Main object of His Majesty's Government is to prevent risk of dangerous misunderstanding with American or other interests in the event of oil being found, in areas concerned? and to make sure that minor Arab rulers, with whom His Majesty’s Government are in special treaty relations, do not fall under Ibn baud's domination. Recent report from Koweit on extent of Ibn Saud's influence in Qatar peninsula (see Koweit despatch No. C.17 of January 18th to Political Resident) shows that this danger is serious. 7. Alternatives appear to be:~ a* to take no initiative with Ibn Saud for the present, but to rely (i) on United States Government informing Standard Oil Company of California of position, (ii) on Company not attempting to extend its sphere of operations east of the blue line? and (iii) on Ibn Saud refraining for the present from attempts further to extend or consolidate his informal influence eastwards* bo to take some action which would make our views and position clear to Ibn Saud wit.out constituting a direct ^ challenge to his position* This could be done by merely informing him of the United States .embassy s request for conies of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 and of our reply* Diplomatic discussions could then be allowed to take their course and question could if necessary be considered of what concessions could be mad-6' to Ibn Saudo c a to make a formal communication to Ibn Saud on the subject of the 'blue line”, which he could not ignore and which he would probably regard as a challenge and ite± bound to take up*8 ° None of above courses is free from diffculty but I incline to course b as offering best opportunity of making nec^ss^ry communication to Ibn Saud in least contentious manner# Please telegraph your views as to the relative advantages and disadvantages of courses a and b. If course b were adopted, course c (which in any case seems open to serious objection) would presumably be unnecessary* 9. As regards paragraph 5 of your telegram No.40 (of Parch list), I agree that it would be best to describe area east of blue line' as falling within 'British sphere of influence', but in view of terminology of Article 3 of 1914 Convention and ol fact that His Majesty f s Government do not claim actual sovereignty over this area, it seems desirable to add the words 'appertaining to Qatar'. Main objection to describing area as falling under 'full sovereignty' of Qatar is that it is uncertain whether Sheikh himself would claim such sovereignty, and embarrassing situation would arise if Sheikh should fail to come up to scratch or should represent to Ibn Saud that he was being obliged by His Majesty's Govern-' ment against his vail to put forward claim* Moreover, if arce east of line is claimed primarily on ground that it falls withi: B ritish sphere, His Majesty's Government would remain free to adjudicate if necessary between respective claims of Sheikh of Qatar and Sheikh of Abu Dhabio They have already recognised coastal area up to point immediately north of Khor el Odeid as falling within the territory of the latter. 10 ?

This enquiry may prove of considerable importance, since there is reason to believe that the interest which it reveals on the part of the United States Government in the question of boundaries in Eastern Arabia is in all probability connected with the activities of United States oil interests in that area. As you are no doubt aware, in July, 1933, the Standard Oil Company of California obtained from King Ibn Saud an oil concession covering the eastern part of his dominions, north the limits of this concession are co-terminous wi tii the frontiers between Saudi Arabia, on the one hand? and Iraq and the independent Arab principality of Koweit, on the other. These frontiers are now laid down in certain agreements referred to in paragraph 4 below, but the position in the south and south-east is, however, less simple. On the 29th July, 1913, His Majesty’s Government concluded with the Ottoman Government a convention defining tne south-eastern boundary of Turkish Arabia from the coast of the Persian Gulf as far as the twentieth parallel ol latitude. A second Convention concluded on the 9 th March, 1^14, continued the definition of this boundary between this ^mxcellency 1 ' ie Right Honourable Sir Percy Loraine, Bart, K.C.M,G., e ^ c * t etc, , etc. , Angora.point and the already delimited frontier between the Vilayet of the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate. Copies of the 1913 Convention are enclosed in this despatch? the text of the 1914 Convention will he found on pages 42 and 43 of the 1933 edition of Volume XI of Aitchison v s 'Treaties, 'Engagements and Sanads' ? a copy of which Is, I understand in the library of His Majesty f s Embassy. The first of these Conventions was never ratified, but the boundary line laid down in Article 11 thereof was definitely adopted by Article 3 of the second Convention, the ratifications of which were exchanged in London on the 3rd June, 1914. His Majesty* s Government in the United. Kingdom have not had occasion to discuss with King Ibn Sand, since he acquired independent sovereignty over Nejd and the Has a Coast, the question of the precise bounda.ry between his dominions and those of the Arab rulers in the Persian Gulf, who are in special treaty relations with His Majesty*s Government, although Ibn Saud has, by article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda of the 20th May 1927 formally recognised those special relations and undertaken to maintain friendly relations with the rulers concerned. But the fact that certain territories on the Ottoman side of the 1913/14 line have now become independent States, cannot be regarded in the view of His Majesty*s Government as in any way affecting the status of the territories on the other side of that line, which were then and still remain under British influence. His Majesty’ Government therefore still regard the 1913/14 line as forming the boundary between the Ottoman Succession State of4- Saudi Aradia and tha t-Mtones of south eastern Arabia with which they are in special relations.

This point is receiving further considera tion; and meanwhile, should you find it necessary to give the United States Embassy any oral explanations on the matter, you should, notwithstanding the fact that the 1914 convention specifically describes the blue line as dividing Nejd from 'the territory of Qatar” avoid referring to the territory to the east of the blue line as specifically forming part of the State of Qatar itself, but refer to it merely as being under 3ritish influence. 6 .

The Cabinet, subsequent to the completion of the memorandum, agreed that the limit of any guarantee of protection given to the jneiidi of Qatar should not, at any rate at the present, extend beyond the base of the Qatar Peninsula. There has been considerable discussion since as to whether any ieoaij.ica.tion of this line was desirable and as to the attitude to be adopted towards Bin 3aua in respect of the area lying between it and the Blue Line which, unaer the 1913 ana 1914 Conventions with Turkey, divides Nejd from the territory of the Arab rulers with whom we are in special treaty relations. ^* Consequent on considerable discussion between India, Jedda and Bushire, and between this department and the Foreign Office, a meeting of the Middle East Committee to consider the position was held on Friday. The draft conclusions of the meeting are flagged, in the light of them I attach a draft telegram to the Government of India, repeated to the Political Resident to issue simultaneously with tne telegram to Jedda irorn the Foreign Office, the draft of which is discussed below. Ifre draft to India represents, I think, conclusionsgenerally satisfactory from our point of view, which met with acceptance by all the departments concerned in the Middle East Committee, it is perhaps unnecessary to discuss it in any great detail. Broadly speaking, we take our stand on the 1913 and 1914■ Conventions as against Itn Saud. The Question oi v\/hat, if any, concession should he made to him in respect o(f the line laid down in those conventions (the maintenance of which hy us he is likely strongly to resent) is to he left for consideration until the question arises. The intermediate area between the line of the 1913 Convention and the ^protection limit of cottar as laid down hy the Cabinet is to he regarded as falling 'within the British sphere of influence and appertaining to Qatar'. H.M. Embassy at itfigora have been authorised (with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for India) to reply to an enquiry received on behalf of the State Department from the United States Embassy there as to the 1913/ 1914 Conventions by communicating copies of those conventions to them, and a supplementary warning has now been sent to them by the Foreign Office to avoid detailed discussion as to whether the area to the east of the Blue Line belongs to Qatar or to any othe^ sheikhdom, but to be emphatic that it is in the British sphere of influence. 4. i The Service Departments were very anxious tha should be made clear to the Resident (not, I think that he is in any aoubt about this) that any guarantee of protection could take effect only from the date of the grant of a concession by the Sheikh and after the necessary arrangements for intelligence etc. to enable us to implement it have been made. A section has been added to the telegram to cover this. 5. The most important point outstanding is that of the tactics to be adopted with Ibn Saud as regards our formal decision to take our stand on the Blue Line of/Minute Paper. Department. 3. I- U, h ^ x - ■ of the 1913/1914 conventions. The Department had felt that it was very undesirable to deal with this m a manner which could be regarded by Bln Baud as provocative. But the enquiry made by the U.S.Embassy at hngora on benalf of the state Department seems to afford an easy way out. Die meeting yesterday was generally disposed to take this view, but It was agreed that In view of the delicacy of the question one various possible alternatives should be put to Sir Andrew i^an, who should be given a lead in favour o± uae solution in question, ana that a final decision should await receipt of his views. The ! Foreisn Office telegram now attached I think covers ; tne ground adequately, though (consequent on certain internal divisions In the Foreign Office) It possibly lather over-emphasises the difficulties involved in taking any action in the natter at this stage.

(0) 119). MR. RENDER explained that the foreign Office had ashed that the meeting should he calledj as 5 although there was no reason to anticipate any conflict of view between th various Departments concerned* the question was exceedingly complex and important points of policy were involved. The question of the actual boundary line between the territory of Ibn Baud and that of the coastal Sheikhs under British protection had formerly been a matter of no great concern* but in view of the possibility of oil being found021 tno 'blue line n ? on the grounds that the 1913 Convention had not been ratified i Guinea, wni±e ? therefore, prepared: ultimately to take their stand on that line, they had not visaed t0 • press the matter, and were inclined to favour a policy which would leave the status of the whole area somewhat indeterminate, a kind of 'no man’s land' being set up between tne Qatar peninsula and the Saudi territories to the west of the 'blue line'. The legal position had, however, now been re-examined and found to be much stronger than had been originally supposed. It was only on the basis of that legal position that any dividing line at cili could be Qi’Qvvn between Saudi Arabia and the territories in south-eastern Arabia under British influence. Circumstances now appeared to render it necessary to draw such a line, and the Foreign Office view therefore was that we should take our stand on the 'blue line' forthwith, at any rate as a basis for negotiations. He wished to differentiate between the strictly legal position and the practical position. He fully realised that in practice it was difficult to draw any lines in a desert area of this type, sparsely inhabited by wandering nomadic tribes owing uncertain allegiance to distant overlords. But, to reach any practical working arrangement for the establish ment of a division between the Saudi and the British spheres, it would be necessary to start from some legal basis, and this could only be furnished by the 1913/14 line. Some of the arguments for regarding this line as legally valid had been set out in his letter of March 16th to Mr. Laithwaite (M,E.(0) 115). Further, the Foreign Office Legal Advisers had pointed out that, while the existence of a division between the British and non-British spneres nad always been accepted, no line oi division other than the 1913/14 line had ever been suggested, so that itwould be most difficult for ihn . , , , . ui ion 0 aud to estaolisn a positive case against its validity. ihe guub ' ion tht;n arose a s to the attitude to be adopted m regard to the intermediate area lying between the 'blue line' and tnc base 01 the Qatar peninsula. He pointed out that trie 'blue line' had not been communicated to I bn Sand when he ash^d for la. 1.1 particulars of our agreements with the independent Arab rulers in 1927. On the other hand, under iirt i v-'ie ^ Ci tne freaty oi Jedda, I bn Saud had recognised the • speci wl relations ol His iviajesty ’ s Government with the Sheikhs ol ■cy.atar and the Oman coast, and had undertaken to maintain peaceful relations with those Sheikhs. This would not, however, necessarily prevent his claiming to control the hinterland or tneir sheikhdoms. The question of the responsibility of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the intermediate area might also present difficulties. If Ibn Saud w ere to accept the 'blue line' and raids were subsequently to occur from the east of it, he might hold His Majesty’s Government responsible for controlling.the raiders. On the other hand, it had already been agreed that any guarantee of protection to be given to the Sheikh of Qatar should not for the present extend beyond the base of the peninsula, so that His Majesty’s Government would have no obligations to protect the inter mediate area against raids from Saudi Arabia. MR. GRIEVE explained that any oil bearing area usually emanated from an extensive underground reservoir of oil which could be tapped at various points. If the Anglo- Persian Oil Cornuany were to find oil in the Qatar Peninsula, they would wish to ensure that this oil field was not exploited by any other workings which might be carried on at a distance of some 40 to 50 miles away. They would, therefore, desire to have a reserved area around their oil field on which other concessions could not be taken up.-5- Mp ME THE 'AITE said that the the light Oi. the vi ews expressed by and u no x' oil lie ci..l He siden t * were in the views of g ne Foreign Office and : was unnecessary for him to add anything to Mr. EendelMs remarks. On certain points of detail * the Foreign Office had examined the question whether the non-communication to I'bn Sand in 1927 of the 1015 Convention in any way weakened our position^ and had reached the conclusion that this was not the casea On a point raised by Mr. Warner * our information had consistently been that the authority exercised by the Sheikh of Qatar within the Qatar peninsula was probably not very effective. On the other hand $ while small Sheikhs in outlying parts of the Peninsula might be reluc tant or even refuse to obey instructions sent them by the Sheikh 5 there was no question of any positive challenge by them to his government ? and the man-power or the peninsula appeared for the most part to be concentrated round Doha and Wakra* the first of which was * of course, the Sheikh's capital 5 and the second very close to it. There were eight questions on which agreement was desired. These were as follows;— (1) Are we to take our stand on tne eastern limit of Ibn Sand ? s authority ? MR* SISAL anticipated that difficulty might arise lx oil were found in the indeterminate areas between the u blue line if and the base of the Qatar peninsula* which was the limit of our protection. He thought it should oe made clear that any concession for oil in this area lay m the hands of His Majesty's Government. Negotiations lor the definition of the boundary would not take place for some time. Meanwhile * we had a breathing space* during whichfurther information could be obtained, with a view to determining the eventual boundary desired. j v.i&lt;o uiiiLv^ w as o.l tne opinion tiiat the more Ihn Sctad was restricted by definite limits * the better it firvn 1 ri 1~,0 -,W -a -n ?; a. „ . i &lt;- e, ? tne 1 egal boundary $ should be insisted on as far as possible. iih. RiiinDbL explained that xe were now mailing it clear to tne Americans tnat his Majesty f s Government regard the ,f blue line' as the eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia anu it was pro cable that the Standard Oil Company of California would pass on this information to I bn Baud. It so 5 I bn baud might well 5 as suggested in Sir A. Hyan’s telegram Ho. 40 (paper He. M.E. (0) 118) , regard our attitude as a challenge, and we might find ourselves involved in a serious difference with him. The foreign office were anxious to avoid such a situation if possible; and 5 if there was to be any question of some eventual c ompromise, it might be well that we should be in a position to offer such a compromise without delay. He agreed 5 therefore, that further information as to the value of the inter- mediate area would be- most desirable. MB* LAITHWAITB^ while agreeing as to the importance of positive information on the oil bearing possibilities of the intermediate area 3 drew attention to trie difficulty of obtaining it. It could be obtained only by local experimeat by experts: climatic conditions apart 9 any attempt at experimental drilling or even exploration would probably almost inevitably lead to political difficulties and * possibly 5 danger to the exploring party. Hie Iraq petroleum Company exploring party had not been allowed to go beyond the base of the Qatar peninsula. He. --.fit rucognised the importance of further information as t o oil prospects 'but the di-f'-fipni + -&gt;/ r^- u — 0 x securing it, at any r ate at this stage , uas very r eal. “ e^tSrbnnb aCCept the ' blje line- as the ccAbuern Doundary. tms stage Mr. Grieve left the meeting).

But, untxl further inrormation as to the value and nature of the ixit6imediate area was available, and more particularly as to whether it contained any important oil resources and. whether the development of those resources was likely to affect the development of any oil in the Qatar peninsula, it was agreed that it would be premature to pursue the matter further. In the circumstances, it was agreed that His Majesty's Government should for the present merely take their stand on the 'blue line', and or*-y consider the ques tion of po S 3 ible territorial concessions to ibn baud after further information had been obtained and in zhe light of the circumstances exist ing at the time. 1 i 1 ; 1 D(3) I: it desirable to v a t- r the artr ar provei d ro vactive 1imit ^ —1 - — §iP..

They aia Wish&gt; however &lt;&gt; to ensure that no concession in the hinterland was granted to any other firm. •^■Nxlidu h'Oiiioc;d out thae it had already oeen agreed cnat it would be impracticable for His Majesty’s Government 5 for the present at least, to undertake to prosect any area to the south of a line across the base of r-he Qatar peninsula. On the other hand, he saw no od jec uion ? if we took our stand on the 'blue line', to making it clear that we regarded the intermediate area as 1 calling within the sphere of influence of His Majesty’s u-o\ eminent, who would thus be entitled to extend their control over the area whenever it should prove desirable and practicable to do so. MR. LAI TH WAITE agreed that there must be a clear understanding as to what area fell within the limits of any guarantee of protection given by His Majesty’s Govern ment. On the assumption that the 'protection limit' approved by the Cabinet on mist February was maintained and that the 'blue line' was adopted as the eastern boundary of Ibn Baud’s dominions, our forces would have a free hand to reconnoitre, and even, if necessary, tale o.ction m tiie intervening area ii this were regarded as forming part oi the Sheikhdom of Qatar or falling' within-9- @) the Qatar sphere of influence and outside the territory of I bn baud. It was agreed that no extension of our protection limit ? as approved by the Cabinet at its meeting held on Wednesday * hist February* 1934 (Cabinet 6 (34) 3) was desirable. (4) she uld the intermediate area be regarded as_apper - taining to Qatar in full sovereignty g as_su ggested in Sir Andrew T?yan f s telegram? rt Ae MR. RhNBEL saw great objection to describing the area to the east of the 'blue line 15 as appertaining to Qatar ' in full sovereignty '. Were we to use so categorical a phrase* the Sheikh of Qatar - wno was notoriously unreliable - would probably inform ion oaud that we were trying to embroil him with Ibn oaau and to use him against Ibn Baud for our own base purposes, he thought that it would be far better to descrioo the intermediate area simply as being within the British sphere of influence* though he saw no objection to audmg the words 'and appertaining to Qatar', if it was thought desirable to do so. If we claimed the area as falling within our sphere of influence, we should then he free to apportion it to any Sheikh under our protection who seemed to have a good claim to it, but we snou^u oe much less dependent on the Sheikh of Qatar, and 11 daoe th&amp; riwn of his letting us down. HR. LAITH1AITB said that the phrase 'appertaining to Qatar' had been deliberately used by the j-adia office in their telegram consulting the Government of India and the political Resident on this point as one of a con- T.^r'rionieed at the same time the venient vagueness. he r^cognisou force of Sir A. Ryan’s arguments in favour of talcing ause of tne phrase 'full sovereignty”, as he gathered from Mr a Kended f s statement might be the case, we mignt perhaps more conveniently make use of sir a* Ryan s suggestion that the indeterminate area should Dt, regarded as iailing within a ^British sphere of influence'*. it was certainly the case that we had in the past determined the boundaries between Qatar and Abu Dhabi. MR. WARNER made the tentative suggestion that tactically it might oe best as a first step to try the effect of merely informing ibn Baud that he must not grant any concessionary rights over the area to the east of the ?, blue line' - without going into any question of sovereignty„ He recalled that in 1922, when the question of the grant of an oil concession by Ibn Baud in this area arose, action on these lines had been taken by Sir Percy Cox and thereafter no more had been heard of it. The meeting, however, was inclined to think that it would be difficult to deal with the question of the limits of the oil concessions without raising the question of political boundaries and rights, and that, on the whole, it would be best to take our stand from the outset on the 'blue line' as the political boundary of the British sphere of influence. It was agreed that the area up to the 'blue line' should be definitely claimed as territory within the British sphere of influence and appertaining to Qatar.'^ 'Wr -11- ^ 5 y ( &lt; 3-) oil OU j.Q u llcl i~j n R i trh o’f* AHn t'.'u - i_ * u .. ^o u i;ncibi be e ncouraged 1:i: claim mi to the u blue Iine u ?

( 6 ^ Shf jZM.dho Ai r Ministry be asked to carry out a re connaissan c e of the c ount ry to the East of the 'Blue Line'? MR. LAITHWAITE said that the sole object of this suggestion was to clear up any doubts there might be as to how far south the Dohat-as-Salwa ran. The maps were to some extent in conflict. If there was to be any reconnaissance it should presumably be carried out by the Air Ministry, who would no doubt first consult with the Admiralty, with a view to ascertaining what information was available 1 0 them. But it would be desirable before any action was taken to obtain the concurrence of the Political Resident. The Resident might well think the present moment, .when negotiations with Qatar were at a very delicate stage, an unsuitable one to conduct a reconnaissance which might arouse suspicions in the mind of the Sheikh. GROUP CAPTAIN PECK stated that the Air Ministry could make a photographic survey and give some idea oi the country. nI ^ MAJOR OSBORNE pointed out that the exact location of Sal.va had oeen iixed ty Major Cheeseman in 19gl _ i. e. , as Lat. 24°45’3C' - Long. 50 c 50'gC', thus determining the approximate southern limit of the Lohat as Salwa. GROUP CAPTAIN PECK stated that, from the Air Ministry point oi view, it was impossible to implement any undertaking oi protection until our arrangements including intelligence^ had been completed. Should any c^ction tdKen by us pro voice Ibn S aud to initiate serious raiding against Qatar 9 we should not be in a pooition to take eiiective action and both our prestige and our relations with the Sheikhs on the trucial coast might suffer. He thought that air reconnaissances over the area between Qatar and the “blue line n might provoke Ibn Saud to instigate such raids. He would 3 therefore 9 like authority to proceed with the necessary measures for establishing aerodromes and an intelligence organisation in the Qatar Peninsula and establish these before air reconnaissances were made. MR. LAIT1TMITE said that the political authorities in the Gulf were already aware of the Air Ministry desiderata regarding intelligence and the importance which the Air Ministry attached to them. He did not 3 however* think that it would be wise to press the matter further at the present stage. What we had first to do was to get the Sheikh to accept our protection and in return for it to give the oil concession to the Iraq Petroleum Company. Once he had agreed in principle to accept or to ask for our protection we could then at once ask him to allow us to take the steps which would be necessary to implement any guarantee given. It would in his view be a mistake to press matters further at the present point.survey by ' I’k also agreed that $ while a new sea in the Dohat as Salwa could probably be made without great uiiiiculty 5 it would be oetter to wait to suggest trio, to untir x artner iiii or mao ion had been obtained from the Resident as to its probable political effects. It was agreed:- (a) that the Air Ministry should not at pi esent conduct a reconnaissance of the country to the east of the 'blue line'; (b) that the War Office should endeavour to check from the records at their disposal the exact location of Salwa as determined by Major Cheeseman in 19S1. (7) What steps, if a n y, should be taken to make it plain to Ibn Saud that His Majesty^ Qovernment regard the 'blue line' as the legal boundary between his dominions and the territories in south-eastern Arabia under British influence? MR. LAITHWAITh said that the India Office had been rather doubtful as to the expediency of making an immediate communication to Ibn baud, in view of the extreme undesirability of doing anything which he could reasonably regard as provocative. They now , however 9 considered that the simplest solution would be that the matter should be broached by informing him as a matter of courtesy of the enquiry received from the United States Ambassador at Angora on behalf of the State Department and of the terms of our reply thereto. Such a communication might, indeed, reasonably be expected by the Saudi authorities, and exception could not well be taken to it. It would not be provocative and it would make our position clear. were we, on tne other hand, uo send a ship or aeroplanes to Salwa for me purpose 01 an air survey or the like, Ibn Saud mignt very well take offence and immediately challenge our rights. MR. RENDER said that it would of course be quite possible to defer the evil day and make no communicationat all to rbn Sand. It was clear from Sir A. Ryan's telegram No. 40 that any direct notification to Ihn Saud of our views regarding the 'blue line' 1 ' might well he regarded hy him as a challenge and involve us in a serious conflict with him. The Foreign Office were not anxious to embark on such a conflict, particularly at a moment when Ihn Saud was already involved in serious difficulties with the Yemen. On the other hand, we might easily find ourselves involved in worse difficulties if we left Ihn Saud under any misapprehension as to the position, particularly now that the United States Government had heen informed. On the whole Mr. Rendel thought that the proposal put forward hy Mr. Laithwaite, i.e.- that we should, as a matter of courtesy, inform the Saudi Government of the request of the United States Embassy at Angora for the texts of the 1913 and 1914 Anglo-Turkish Conventions, and of the reply returned thereto - offered the best solution of the difficulty. This would he a reasonable and straightforward course. It would leave Ihn Saud under no misapprehension as to the T)°sition, and at the same time would not he a direct challenge 5 so that he would probably react to it much less violently than if we were to send a ship to Salwa or aircraft over the Bahr al Qarah to carry out a survey! It was, of course, possible that Ibn Saud might incite the local Akwan to raid into Qatar, but he did not think this very probable, partly because Ibn Saud had always in the past been most careful not to put himself in the wrong with us, and partly because, as far as he knew, the vthole area was so poor that raiding would hardly be worth while. He felt, however, that it was essential in the first place to get Sir A. Ryan's views on the proposal, though he saw no objection to giving him a strong lead in favour of it.© u agreed with. Mr* hended T s estimate of the position. If we were now to say nothing to Ihn Saud and to leave him to ascertain our view of the Toounaai y indirectly taro ugh the Standard Oil Company $ . might very well think that his best tactics would be to the east of the ,f t&gt;lue line”. If we had once definitely given him to understand that we regarded the 'blue line' as his eastern frontier * we should be in a much stronger position oo deal with any subsequent steps he might take to the east of it. It was agreed that ? subject to reference to Sir Andrew Ryan ^ the request of the United States Ambassador at Angora for information as to the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 and 1914 and our reply thereto s should be communicated to Ibn Saud through diplomatic channels. (8) Shou'.a Colonel 3 7 owle 9 Resident in the Persian Calf 9 b e in possession of the above conclusions for his own information when he proceeds to Cl,tar at the end of March to negotiate with the Sheikh? the conclusions of the meeting* if and when approved by higher authority* should be available to Colonel Fowle for his own information before he resumed discussion with the Sheikh of Qatar on the 31st March. It would obviously be of great assistance to him to have as complete a knowledge as possible of the way in which the minds of His Majesty's Government were working. MR. RENDEL said that it was well known that the Stieikh of Qatar was most untrustworthy, ana that* if Colonel Powle were* as had at one time been pronosed. 9 to' discuss our views with ask the Sheikh for information as to his frontiers or Xo/ -15-- 16 - Mm, it was probable that the whole story would be passed on to Ibn Baud in a misleading form and further complicate io^ue. uo VO.V! no reason, however, why Colonel Fowls should not be fully informed for his confidential information of the various views which had been expressed. He thought it would be also most useful if arrangements could be made for the record or the present discussion to be sent to Sir A.Ryan xQi 1 hib secret information* as it might be of great help to n-uii m a a'/i sing his Majesty’s Government in future. This* if sanctioned, would of course not be treated as a precedent. It was agreed tnat tne India Office should draft a telegram fur transmission to the Government cl India and the Political Resident in the Persian anlf ? which should be repeated to Sir Andrew Ryan, and also that the Foreign Office should draft a telegram asking for Sir A. Ryan‘s views on the whole matter. THE CHAIRMEN considered that, as the above con clusions were generally agreed to, it would be unnecessary to refer the matter to the Ministerial Committee, but the draft telegrams should be circulated to the Departments represented on the Sub-Committee for their concurrence. MR. LAITIHVAITE referred to the fact that in the course of the preceding discussion the question had been raised of the date on which our guarantee of protection to the Sheikh of Qatar would become effective. He thought there was no dispute on this point. Ho guarantee could be given unless and until the Sheikh of Qatar had agreed to grant the Qatar oil concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (acting for the Iraq Petroleum Company), or come into operation until the necessary intelligence, etc., arrangements to enable us to implement the guarantee had been made. COLONEL MACKESY referred to the possibility of the oil concession, if granted, not being worked. He was not quite sure that the risk of a first-class row with IbnSana t/v«s iu.8uii.ied if the concession i‘or oil ■was not to be worked. -dra LiilbhkAiTlii said that such information as was cl ^ a i table faugges bed 11 ial the Xraq f 5 etroleum Cor ipany ? if secured the Qatar concession, would probably not wish to develop it actively. On the other hand, while we had consistently taken the most conservative view of the probability of oil development by them it could not be overlooked tnat the decision on this would probably depend on other factors. If Bahrein and Qatar proved to be of biie same structure and if the Bahrein oil, as seemed possible, was of a very high quality, or if, on the other hand, the California Oil Company in II as a were to conduct intensive development on the eastern part of their con cession, the Qatar Oil concessionnaires might well take a very different view. In any case it seemed important t° acquire control of what appeared potentially to be an important oilfield for His Majesty* s Government. There seemed some hope that we might secure a guarantee, though of a qualified character, from the Iraq petroleum Company, in respect of the erection of a refinery in Qatar in certain events. In any case, in the event of war or the like, the oil, even if there was some delay in organising arrangements for its production, would be within our effective control, and owing to our special treaty relations with tne Sheikh we might anticipate that we should not have to face the same difficulties with it as in the case of a country such as Persia, if Persia were to remain neutral. Apart from the oil aspect of the question, the India Office were disposed to think that it was of real importance as matters now stood to take a definite line with Ibn Baud as regards Qatar and the Trucial Sheikhdoms. Otherwise we-18 might well find that he had graudally consolidated his influence in these states and had for practical purposes absorbed them* That would on general grounds be most undesirable from the point of view of His Majesty f s Govern ment » MR. RENDER agreed with Mr. Laithwaite that the oilques- tfou was by no means the only or the decisive factor, The basic question at issue was really whether I bn Saud should be allowed to establish his authority over the whole of south-eastern Arabia. It was a fundamental principle of British policy that His Majesty’s Government should retain their influence over the Sheikhs and rulers of south-eastern Arabia* and* if that influence was to be maintained and a conflict with Ibn Saud was to be avoided* it would be necessary sooner or later to come to a clear agreement as to the division between the Saudi and British spheres. The oil question? and the possible development of air communications?were now bringing the matter to a head* but it would always have been necessary sooner or later to face the problem. If no eastern limit were to be established to Saudi Arabia* United States and other commercial interests would not be slow to seise on the indeterminate character of the boundary* and might well extend their activities eastwards to the Trucial boast with most unfortunate political results. /-h nr Tie r rygTQ lu hr.

Use of expression 'Katr sphere of influence' will seern to him hypocritical in connexion with an area in which the Sheikh has never exercised influence and in which his has been preponderant for several years. He would 'better understand that area beyond Dlue and violet lines const!cu- ted a Briti sh sphere of influence in which it was for His Majesty’s Government to determine the boundary of local rulers.

Ought we not to keep a more definite record of observable contaets,e.g*» the visits of members of tne ruling families to Mecca and, if possible, to Ibn Jilfwl In Qasaf Ought we to ignore quite so readily money payments, which, if regular, can only appear in Arab eyes as tribute to an over-lord 4 ?

S.W. 1. March, 1954. &gt;9 Y ° u •” l1 ' ’’e.Tiea'ber my telling you this morning that I was a little uneasy on one point in connexion with the question of the Qatar boundaries; i.e. lest we should have weakened our position with Ibn Baud in regard to hie blue line by our failure to give him copies of the Anglo-Turkish conventions of 19x5 and 1914 establishing that line^when, in is37, he asked us (see sir G. Clayton's report of June 8th, 1927, of which we sent you a copy in our letter Mo. K _2585/11 9/91 of, 1927) for 'copies of all existing 'treaties and agreements between Mis Majesty's Government and the various rulers and chiefs in Arabia and on the 1! Persian Gulf'. 2. It had occurred to me that Ibn saud might well contend that his object in asking us for these documents was in order to know exactly how he stood with regard to our claims and position generally in Arabia, and that the G. Laithwaite, Esq. — 3ECB. pa. CcPT. 2 2 MAR 1934 riD A OFFICE fact....fact that we did not communicate to him the treaty instruments laying down the blue line left him free to ignore that line if he wished to. He could probably argue that he had no knowledge of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions or at any rate of the ratification of the i9j_4 Convention, and that as nobody appeared to have established any effective claim to the hinterland of Qatar to the east of the blue line, he was perfectly free m the absence of any warning to toe contrary from us or from tne Sheikh of Qatar to establish A^wan colonies tnere and generally bring this area under his authority if he wished to do so. o. i have now referred the point to Malkin and am glad to say that he does not take this risk very seriously. In his view, when Ibn Saud asked for 'copies of all existing 'treaties and agreements between His Majesty's Government '■and the various rulers and chiefs in Arabia and on the 'Persian Gulf', he cannot have been intending to ask for treaties between His Majesty's Government and the Ottoman lapire. But Malkin thinks that we should be protected by a still....still further consideration. Ihn Sand's object in asking for these treaties was presumably to ascertain what were the relations between these rulers and ourselves and not to ascertain what were the boundaries between tneir territories and the former Ottoman Empire since these would not have been laid down in treaties between His Majesty’s Government and the rulers in question. Malkin thinks in fact that the terms of Ibn Saud’s request would have been inconsistent with any idea that he was asking for information as to the boundaries between the former Ottoman Empire and tne territories of the Arab rulers; so that trie snort answer to any question as to why we did not communicate the two Anglo-Turkish Conventions to him would be si iply that he had not asked for them. In any case, of course, the non-communication of these treaties to Ibn Saud cannot affect the question of the legal 'J H V\ authe-rety of tne blue line. 4. In these circumstances it seems clear that my misgivings were unfounded, but it may perhaps be convenient... .CIBCULATSD) Bated ReoeiTed 20th March, 1934, 1 p.nu ff 659* Addressed to Secretary of State for India and repeated to Jeddah, copy to Political Resident* Tour telegram of the 19th instant, 739« Qatar boundaries, 2* W© have discussed with Powle f , said agree that in course of action suggested/(a), (b), (o) and (d) of your telegram is definitely to be preferred if His MaJesty^s Government are now satisfied that it can be maintained against ibn Baud* Difficulty might, however, arise if the bh-^lkh Qi^-tar, through fear of ibn Baud or other reason, deolinad to co-operate with us in pressing claim to sphere of influence up to the Blue line, and we presume that the matter will not be taken up on these lines with the United States Government or Ibn Saud until after Powle has had opportunity of ascertaining Sheikh’s attitude* 3« Fowle has seen and agrees* l' ;iv nd£xejp FILE COPY RJE/WB &gt; -13 5° SECRET ti p PF T iii L iii G R A M.

Z-L 3, This Is for discussion in the Middle East Committee on Tuesday. I mentioned on the telegram of 15th March below that the Foreign Office Legal Advisers now thought that we should ce on strong legal ground in maintaining the Blue Line of the 1913 Convention against Ibn Laud. The position is developed in further detail in Handel s letter of 16th March below. As you will see, the Foreign Office are now definitely in favour of: (a) faking our stand on the Blue Line at the outset; (b) Putting forward a positive claim, preferably on behalf of the Sheikh of Qatar, to the territory to the east of it; (c) Compromising, if necessary, on the basis of c to Ibn 3aud of an area more or less Identical with the Barr- al-Qp.rah plus its hinterland. (d) Letting the U.S. Embassy at Angora have copies at once (they have asked for these) of the 1913 and 1914 Conventions. (e) Being prepared to make clear to Ibn Saud our view as regards the Blue Line. 2 The really important change in the situation is the opinion now confidently expressed by the Foreign Office Legal Advisers that we are on strong legal ground internationally in maintaining the Blue Line against Ibn Laud. That being so, I think there is miuch to be said for abandoning the idea of a No Man's Land, while continuing to restrict both the area of any Q^tar oil concession and of our guarantee of protection to the Sheikh to the Qatar Peninsula. The line we might take as regards the area lying between the base of the Qatar Peninsula and the BlueLine (or any modification of that line) might, I think, he that this area represented a Qatar sphere of influence &lt;r not policed, or efxactively (or at all) administered, but recognised by us as appertaining to the Sheikh. It would be open to us in these circumstances to tsk e punitive action against tribes who had misbehaved in Qatar and fled into it and who did not belong to Neja, without any prior consultation with Ibn Saud. in the case of definitely Nejdi tribes who raided across it into the Qatar Peninsula we should have to ask for reparation from Ibn Saud through the diplomatic channel. 3. Prom a different standpoint, the advantage of eliminating an indeterminate area is, of course, that it eliminates any risk of an attempt dy Americans or others to establish themselves in it on the ground of the grant of a concession either by Ibn Saud or by some local man of straw. 4* The decision (if it is taken) to raise the natter positively with Ibn Saud is at the same time a serious one It is far from improbable that the Rasa oil concession given by him extends across the Blue Line into the hinterland of Qatar, and in any event the blow to his prestige which would be constituted by any public intimation that H.M.G. do not recognise his authority to the east of the Blue Line may be so severe as to make it probable that he will strenuously resist any effort to maintain the 1913-14 Conventions against him. I am not quite sure that there would not be advantage in at once communicating the Conventions to the U.3. Embassy at Tt*. Angora, with an intimation (as separately proposed in *** ^ ^ {far official letter/*®...,the Foreign Office) that we regard theTT-’ the Blue Line as the eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia, and leave matters at that for the moment, awaiting a suitable opportunity to present itself to make our attitude clear to Ibn oaud himself* To &amp;o out of our way at this stage to make an unpalatable communication of this nature to him may well be regarded as merely provocative* But this is c*. point on which the position may be clearer after Tuesday s discussion* In the meeting I might take~the^ ~ line® above? Any recommendations must, of course, be subject to the approval of higher authority. —*1512/279/91 INDEXED {MEDIATE. \ V ) f &gt; / 16th March, 1934. 1823 l-P 5 4 My dear Gilbert, I have been looking into the question of the Qatar boundaries which is dealt with in your memorandum B 430, the latest revise of which I received a few days ago. Since the Foreign Office concurred in the terms of tlfit memorandum there have, as you know, been various developments, and we have also gone into the legal aspects of the questionrmore fully than was possible when the matter was first considered^wtth- ^oiur— legaH .-^dviooge^ as a result of this reconsideration of the matter, and also of the arguments advanced in Ryan^ telegrams Nos. 8 Saving of February 14th, and 30 of March 5th (with which I may say we entirely agree), I think our present view*would be as follows. S. Perhaps the most important point which has emerged from our discussion with our Legal Advisers is that^in view of the fact that the 1913 line is 'adopted', and unmistakeably defined^in Article 3 of the 1914 Convention, which was duly ratified J.G. Laithwaite, Esq., India Office. COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL o f RE33. P21. BEPT. 17 MAR 1934 INDIA OFFICE- 2 - n OfK - U*£~ fetvyU l U±t ZtX y*nA»**+^ fiw ( V(i?. lC.J~ -Ox &lt;^ L ~ ratified, is from the point of view of international law perleotly valid, so that we should be on strong legal ground in maintaining that it still marks the boundaries between Saudi Arabia, as one of the Ottoman succession States, and the territories in south-eastern Arabia with which His Majesty’s j Government are in special treaty relations. You will see that we have developed this point in paragraph 3 of our draft despatch to Angora enclosed in our official letter No. E 1206/1206/91 of today’s date to you. 3. A second point which has emerged is that the 1914 Convention speaks of the blue line as separating the Turkish territory from the ’’terriory” of Qatar, and not merely, as in the case of ihe 1913 Tw^ty^, from the ’’peninsula” of Qatar. We are now of opinion that this further strengthens our case for contending that the negotiators of the Convention intended to regard the territories to the east of the ’’blue ”£ine” as politically appertaining to the Sheikhdom^ of fatar and not merely as geographically attached to the Qatar peninsula....-3- peninsula. This point seems to me important because, as I have said above, I personally entirely share Ryan's view that there will be little or no hope of getting Ibn Baud to accept a frontier so to speak y against a vacuum, and that, if we are to maintain the 'blue line' as a real and valid boundary, it will be essential to take up some positive attitude about the political status of the terri tory to the east of it./^.In this connexion it is perhaps relevant to note that Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda does not merely commit Ibn Baud to maintaining peaceful relations with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman coast, but also constitutes a clear recognition by him of the special treaty relations of His Majesty's Government with those Sheikhs - a recognition which seems to me to preclude Ibn Baud from himself acquiring or claiming any kind of over lordship or suzerainty over those Sheikhs or over any territory which we can reasonably claim to fall within their sphere. It seems to me in fact that Article 6 of the TreatyJ -4- Treaty of Jedda read in conjunction with the terms of Article 3 of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914 gives us an even stronger case than we have hitherto imagined for refusing to admit that Ihn Saud possesses or has ever possessed any rights to the east of the ’’blue line”. 5. In the light of the legal opinion referred to above, and of the considerations advanced in Ryan’s telegrams, we now therefore definitely incline to the view that the balance of advantage is against maintaining an indeterminate area, or ”no man’s land”, and in favour of our taking our stand at once on the ’’blue line” not only as the eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia but also as the dividing line between that kingdom and the territories of south-eastern Arabia coming within our sphere.-line 11 -- QD-th^ eastern-boundary—cri:-'Sau.dl'tegb^4re^ v/e are confirmed in this view by the request of the United States Embassy at ^ngora for copies of the 1913 and 1914 Conventions, and by other signs of increasing American interest in this area, e.g. the recently proposed visit of the United States Minister at Bagdad to Riyadh, and the various indications of an active interest in oil possibilities on the part of the Standard Oil of California. &lt;6^, But if on further consideration it is^decided to abandon ~Uae ma-i-n-tenarne-e-of- an indeterminate area,that does not mean that we should necessarily favour any /-n. extension.of any oil concession granted in respect of &gt;w Qatar or of any guarantee of protection given by His Majesty’s Government to the Sheikh of Qatar beyond a line running south of a line drawn across the base of the peninsula. Indeed, you will remember that this question was considered in connexion with the formula of protection which was drawn up at the Middle East Official Sub-Committee meeting of February 23rd, and that we then agreed that the question....- 6 - Juestion of the landward limit of the proposed latar oil concession and of the proposed guarantee of protection oe dealt with independently of ^ x J( to the Sheikh -eould, h the question of the political boundaries of the Sheikhdom. While for all these reasons our present attitude is that we should maintain the 'blue line' against Ibn Saud and indfte4 leave him in no further doubt as to our claim to regard the area to the east of it as falling within our sphere, it would of course be for consideration whether it may not be desirable eventually to offer him some concession in this area, particularly if it turns out that tribes to the east of the 'blue line” do in fact owe him definite allegiance. This possibility is considered in conclusion (c)(i) of your memorandum, but I think that it is now clear that if we are eventually to establish any modified line, we shall first have to establish our rights up to the 'blue line', since otherwise we shall have nothing to give away or bargain with. In this connexion it is perhaps worth noting that, accoidingto Dixon 1 s latest report, of which you sent us a copy in your letter P.2. 1177/34 of 7th March.,, the Bay of Salwa appears to extend further to the south than is shown on our 1:1,000,000 maps. This seems to be borne out by Philby T s (1:2,000,000) 1932 map, published in the Geographical Journal of January lyT~M ‘4 1933, where the Bahr-as-Salwa is shown in detail as extending southwards to a latitude hardly north of that of the Khor-al- Odaid, It may thus be that, when the area is properly surveyed. it will be found that a strict interpretation of the ,T blue 'line” would cut off a very long and very narrow strip of coast to the west of Salwa Bay from the rest of Hasa, and that a far more satisfactory and reasonable line could be drawn from the southern end of the Bahr-as-Salwa in a southerly direction, which would in fact start from much the same point as a line drawn across the base of the peninsula. This would much reduce the extent of the uncertain area and might offer the possibility of various eventual compromises for the northern end of the line^ which we could perhaps discuss at Tuesday^ meeting. Incidentally it may be worth considering having....W- having the Bahr-as-Salwa re-surveyed, so that we may know exactly where it does in fact end. But this is perhaps mainly a point for the Service departments. In the circumstances described above our present attitude therefore is that we should^not only firmly make ojxr stand on the 'blue line' at the outset, but that we should ; put forward a positive claim.jon behalf of the Sheikh of x Qatar^to the territory extending right up to the northern portion of it. If this seems likely to lead to serious difficulty, we could eventually compromise by agreeing to some line running south from the head of Salwa Bay. Meanwhile, the view of my higher authorities here is that everything points to our having to make a very early communication about these frontiers, not only to the Americans, as proposed in our letter No. E 1206/1206/91 referred to above, but also to Ibn Baud himself, if we are to avoid a great deal of trouble later on. ^ f Lv'fov.

Jrasef' •Hu P.Z. 299/34.. r, over tte years 1911-13 between the Turkish Government and His Maiesty’s Government on the various matters in dispute between them in the Persian Gulf area culminated in the latter year in the signature of two Conventions defininc inter alia the eastern limits of Turkish authority ,n Arabia. The Convention of 29th g July 1913, which defined the eastern boundary of Nejd, is alone relevant ^ the nresent 7 purpose Under that Convention, which, though reference is made to it n the ratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 9th March 1914, was never itself ratified, the eastern boundary of the Turkish Sanjaq of Nejd was defined by a blue me on the map running due south from the head of the bay opposite Zaqnuniyeh Is and in thg San Gulf to the 20th parallel of latitude in the Central Arabian Desert. The mxt of the recant article is given in section II of the Appendix attached to this .Note Its wording (“ une ligne . . . separera le Medjd de la presqu lie d El Katr ^ limites du Nedid sont indiquees par une ligne bleue . • ; ) ^ouW FsUtv 'ilie contention that the blue line was at once the eastern frontier of Nejd and the western frontier of Qatar. But there are definite objections to adopting this view. I the first place there is nothing to show that this was, m fact, the intention of His MaiestVs Government at the time when the Convention was concluded, or that they hadmiv object beyond limiting the eastern boundary of the Turkish possessions in his area Secondly there is So evidence of any claim to suzerainty by Qatar so far to the tv^st or so faf to the south. Thirdly, the Resident's telegram of Uth January 1934 T 19 emphasises the absence of control by the Sheikh of Qatai over the interior , f hkSiateVand a fortiori over regions so remote from Dohah as are now under consideration). Fourthly (though this by itself is probably not of serious importance! the position vis-a-vis Ibn' Saud is to some extent compromised, as explained below, at any rate as regards the Barr-al-Qarah, by the line fixed by Sir Percy Cox m 19 2. Fifthly it is arguable that even m a formal document such as the 1J13 Convention,, the fact that thf blue line is spoken of separating Ne d from *0 Qatar need not be regarded as determining the boundary ot Qatar, ihe Qatar FemnsuLa was the closest prominent geographical feature and the nearest adjoining Arab p^olitica entity on the mainland, and a reference to it for descriptive purposes n0 \'“ a d t ” al : Finally, there is much to be said for giving no avoidable extensions to the bound a of Qatar, even if the consequence is that we have to_deal with an area of indeterminate ownership between those boundaries and the blue line. Line indicted in 1922 by Sir P. Cox to Ibn Saud and Major Holmes as the Eastern Limit of any Oil Concession in respect of Hasa. P.Z. 180/34. 6 . One more incident of importance should be recorded before coming to the latest evidence as to the view held by the Sheikh of Qatar as to his southern boundary The incident is that referred to m Colonel Dicksons letter ot 4th J 1933, No. 143, to the Political Resident, copies of which were received under tae Political Resident’s express letter of 18th December 1933, No. 1934 S., when Sn Percy Cox, who was then High Commissioner for Iraq, in a discussion at Cqair m Id-- with Ibn Saud, then Sultan of Nejd, and Major Holmes, warned both the Suita and Major Holmes that the Sultan could grant no concession, and Major Jloime receive none from him, in respect of the Principality of Qatar, and drew o n a ma P a line running from Djau-ed-Dukhan to Dohat-as-Salwa, which, e 111 ica e 1 m represent the eastern boundary of any concession granted by Ibn baud in re sP^ of Hasa. Such a line, as will be seen from the map, excludes the whole Cat Peninsula (and incidentally a substantial area lying to the west of the bine n ^ of the Anglo-Turkish Convention). It also includes m Hasa an area to the east oi mu OI tne iinglO-iarKISIl Qyuuvoutiuu;. Xb cu.au i xX + blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention. It should, however, he noted that wtiiie Busliire Memo. 947 S. of 20th Dec. 1922. P.Z. 464/ 33 . it constituted a definite indication of the High Commissioner’s view as to the eastern boundary of Hasa, it in no way specifically defined the boundaries ot Qatar save in far as Qatar might be regarded as marching with Hasa and or ml g regarded as having been granted a western frontier hounded by the blue line ot 19l3 Convention at the time when that Convention was concluded.*- 1 *' 7. The statement reported in Bushire Memorandum No. 947 S. of 20 th Decembei 1922 to have been made by Sir P. Cox that Ibn Saud had agreed with Sir P. Cox, in 1922, that the boundary line between Nejd and Qatar should follow a hne rannmg due south from the end of the bay south of Bahrein Island and just east ot MabaK as t Sir Percy Cox’s comments on this incident are contained in the Note dated 27th February 1934, printed as Appendix IY to this Memorandum. &amp; ■ #11 is, no bot edge con kit-larch 19 south in iliftothesou 1 report, howev klP.O.C. hi iion) of the |tlie southern a!

I.P.C. Map of February-March 1933. 8 . The map compiled by the I.P.C. geologists during their survey in Qatar in February-March 1933 marks a southern boundary linf starting on the sea-coas^ immediately south of Jabul-el-Naksh about 10 miles north of Salwa town and 12 miles north of the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, turning abruptly to the south- south-east imniediately south-east of Jabul-el-Naksh for a distance of some 12 miles to Qalat-ali-Bin-Said and thence runuing due east, leaving Tuair-al-Hamir on its left, through the Wadi-al-Ghurban to the sea, which it apparently reaches at a point some 8 miles north of the outlet of the Khor-al-’Odeid inlet and not very far into the Naqiyan Sandhills, The A.P.O.O., in communicating a copy of this map, remarked : “ The dotted line boundary to the south of Qatar is apparently the Sheikh’s version of the line The I.P.C. report, however, is not definite about this.” The A.P.O.C. have since reported that, according to one member (Haji A. F. Williamson) of the geological party which visited Qatar in February and March 1933 the southern boundary shown on their map was indicated by the Sheikh himself. If the line in fact represents his view, the boundary, as will be seen will correspond very closely to the pre-war line recorded by Lorimer. Conclusions as to the Southern Boundary of Qatar. 9. It is suggested, in the light of the evidence collected above — (a) that the south-eastern boundary of Qatar must lie to the north of the Khor-al-’Odeid and the district of ’Aqal; (b) that while His Majesty’s Government had at no stage formally recognised any specific southern boundary to Qatar (save to the extent referred to in (a)), such evidence as is available goes to show that the pre-war boundary ran roughly south-east across the base of the Peninsula, from Dohat-as-Salwa, or a point slightly north of it, to a point north of the Khor-al-’Odeid. There is no recorded evidence of any more extensive claims by the Sheikh of Qatar other than those to Abn Dhabi territory referred to in paragraph 2 above ; (c) in the light of the above, that, if it proves that the Sheikh of Qatar now regards the line shown on the I.P.C. map as his southern boundary, this may be accepted by His Majesty’s Government as generally satisfactory. Acceptance of that line, if we continue to regard the blue line of the 1913 Convention as the eastern boundary of Ibn Sand’s territories (or even if we were to agree to the attribution of the Barr-al Qarah district lying east of the blue line to Hasa (see paragraph 18 below)), will admittedly leave an area of undetermined ownership between Qatar and Nejd. The problems involved in this are discussed in greater detail in paragraphs 10 and following. If, however, His Majesty’s Government are prepared to face them, the boundary in question has the merits that it is consistent with the obligations we have undertaken to Abu Dhabi ; it is equally consistent with the maintenance of the blue line of the 1913 Convention as against Ibn Sand (or with such a modifi cation of that line as is referred to in paragraph 19 (c) (i) below; and it has the advantage of definitely limiting the area of any commitments in respect of protection, &amp;c., into which His Majesty’s Government may think it desirable to enter in the event of an oil concession being granted by the Sheikh.Pos.tion of Area lying between Base of Qatar Peninsula and Blue Line of Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. 10 If in these circumstances, it is accepted that the southern boundary of Qatar , J 1 U ; r Q !• p rnrmino' via or to the north of Sakak more or less south-east from Dohat-as-Salwa or a point slightly to the north of Dohat-as-Salwa to a point to ths ~ xhnv al-Odeid the difficult question arises of the position of the count., fyTng between such a line and the blue ide of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. Importance of Maintaining the Blue Line. 11 On the one hand, it appears definitely important if possible to maintain the blue line laid down in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as against C saud or any other future ruler of this part of Arabia \\ hile the 1913 Convention was never ratified, the blue line at any rate represents the agreement reached at the lime between Turkey and His Majesty’sGovernment as to the limits of Turkjsh authority in northern Arabia and on the Persian Gulf, and in dealing with Ibn Sand X successor in title to the Turks we can, it would seem, not unreasonably take onr Stand on it The difficulties of finding any satisfactory substitute are patent. The undesirability of giving Ibn Sand, in the absence of any definite eastern boundary to his territories, an excuse for territorial expansion (as distinct irom the exercise, as 1 , resent of an informal influence and the receipt from our Arab clients of payments IS we do not recognise and the existence of which we ignore) in the hinterland of the Trucial Coast and of Muscat is equally clear. Such expansion would c ear y involve a risk either of his coming into conflict with the ocal rulers, whose treaty Xtious with His Majesty’s Government he has formally recognised or of his •establishing an influence in the Sheikhdoms in question so powerful as to oe •embarrassing from our point of view. Disadvantages of Maintenance of the Blue Line while fixing Southern Boundary of Qatar at the Base of the Qatar Peninsula. 12. At the same time, important on general grounds, for the reasons given, as the maintenance of the blue line appears to be, the fact must be faced that m the oresent case, if we continue to regard it as the eastern boundary of Ibn baud s terntoiy, and if as suggested, we accept a southern boundary lor Qatar running roughly across the base of°the Qatar Peninsula, a not inconsiderable area lying between the two States, and peopled by migratory Bedouin tribes will be left m an indeterminate political position. There is a possibility that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who has m the past exercised a wide influence, and made tribal alliances of his own, m t e Trucial hinterland-c/. Sir P. Cox’s letter No. 176 of 28th June 1904-might prefer some claim to such an area. But, though on this point further information will e sought from the Resident, there seems little evidence of any active interest on the part of Abu Dhabi in any area to the west of ’Aqal. Assuming that no such claim exists, or could be substantiated, the alternatives are to recognise the area as belonging to Ibn Sand ; to recognise it as belonging to the Sheikh of Qatar ; or to regard it as a political no-man’s land. 13. If we recognised it as belonging to Ibn Saud we could, if necessary, call upon him to keep Bedouin raids into Qatar from it under control. But such recognition would not merely he inconsistent with the maintenance of the blue line of the 1 JL&gt; Convention, to the abandonment of which, as stated above, the objections appear to be strong, hut would represent a formal acceptance of Saudi sovereignty to the borders or Qatar and Abu Dhabi which might well prove embarrassing. 14. If, on the other hand, it is attributed to the Sheikh of Qatar, we should be justified in expecting the full co-operation of the Sheikh in dealing with Bedouin activities within its limits. But such an attribution would not merely give to Q at ai* .u substantial area which she does not in the past appear to have claimed, but would •extend the limits of any liability for protection which we may undertake in connection with the grant of an oil concession. It might he necessary to claim the. area (or at any rate its coastal strip) for Qatar if there were serious signs of foreign interest in it or of an intention on the part of Ibn Saud to occupy it. But pending such developments it seems wiser to limit our commitments and to avoid any extension ot the area recognised by us as Qatar.1 nL; !

Before reaching a conclusion it maybe well to place on record such scanty information as is available about the nature and the political conditions of the indeterminate area Apart from the coastal district known as the IWal-Qarah which is further discussed m paragraph IS below, the bulk of it appears to belong to he Jafurah desert, which Lornner describes as an area “possessing only a lew wells of very bitter water, a little scanty grazing, with a surface of red and burning hor.II,892- sand, in which living conditions are extremely difficult and which is frequented 8 ' to any considerable extent’’only by “the hardy A 1 Morrah, and even they avoid entering it unless in winter or m search of a refuge from more powerful enemies” (c/. Appendix, section I (yi) ). Since the date of Lorimer’s Gazetteer, Mr Bertram Thomas, on his recent crossing of the Rub-al-Khali, has passed through'this area from south to north, travelling from the well of Banaiyan near Latitude 23° 11' 40' via aiuwain, vakhala, and the western extremity of a salt lake lying immediately west of the Ivhor-al Odeid,^ across the pre-war Qatar frontier to Dohah. His account is of importance because it makes it clear that such local control as is exercised is exercised solely by nomad Bedouin tribes (and principally the A 1 Murra, who are a tribe dwelling m the sands, whose influence extends well down into the Rub-al-Khali) Secondly, even though he travelled with a “rabia,” or guarantor, from the 41 Murra tribe, the journey was rendered extremely dangerous by the risk of an attack on the party by Ikhwan fanatics, who roam apparently at large, over the whole area. 1 hirdl}, the sites of balwa, Iskak (?~Sakak) and Mabak, the first two of which lie on and the third slightly south of, the pre-war boundary of Qatar, were at the time of his journey m the hands of the Ikhwan, with the result that he could not visit them. 1/. On the question of political conditions Mr. Thomas throughout his journey (the route of which lay well to the east of the blue line of the Angio-Turkish Convention) from the centre of the Rub-al-Khali northwards to the Persian Gulf refers to the established influence of Ibn Sand and its beneficent results and remarks: “To-day peace, the peace of Bin Saud, prevails throughout the sands Ihe influence of the Ruler of Central Arabia, wielded through his able Viceroy at Hofuf, Ibn Jiluwi, compels peace between all these old enemies, not through direct control, for there is and can be none, but through the immense personal prestige of Abdul Aziz himself. A belief in his strength and star has swept across the sands. Not love, but awe, serves this wise providence that so directs affairs. . . . Thus, the sand tribes proper are in some degree leagued with Bin Saud. They pay to him a nominal tribute and by that act are ensured mutual protection one from the other. In theory the tribute is an annual levy of one dollar on each camel. In practice, the Rashid have no money, and in any event they escape proper payment by reason of their remoteness. They do, however, send a camel from year to year as occasion offers in token of submission. When, however, rains fall in the northern sands and they migrate thither, the tax-gatherers’ demands must be met, and a few camels are sold for the purpose. Light as is the bond, the tribes grumble at it. . . . They all swear that the existing peace shall last only as long as the present regime of Riyadh. Let Riyadh or Hofuf be thought to have lost its power, and raiding will be resumed immediately, and blood will flow again. ...” Mr. Thomas’s remarks may be compared with those of Mr. Philby (who in 1932 travelled through the Barr-al-Qarah area and thence south-west to the Jabrin oasis) reproduced in section III of the Appendix to this Note. 2560 A2 Ai’abia Felix, 216-7, 281. Arabia Felix, p. 245, footnote. Arabia Felix, pp. 271-2.The Barr-al-Qarah District. 18 The importance of this district for the present purpose is first that it embraces, the coastal strip lying between the blue line and the pre-war western Oitir and secondly that it appears to correspond fairly closely, il not exactly, witti the triangle of land lying to the east of the blue line, which falls withm the area left to the west of the rough line indicted to Ibn Saud and Major Holmes by Sir P Cos-, in 1&lt;I 9 2 (see paragraph 6 above). Mr. Philby, with the assistance of recommendations and guides furnished by Ibn Jiluwi, the Saudi Governor of Hasa, travelled through a portion of it in 1932. The impression left by his Empty Quarter is that the dominant political influence at the present day are the Saudi Government and the Ikliwan Details of the Barr-al-Qarah district are given m the extract from Lorimer reproduced as item I (v) in the Appendix to this Note. As will be seen Lorimer considered that it “ might perhaps be reckoned as included m the Sanjaq ot llasa — in other words, in the pre-war Ottoman Sandjaq of Nejd. On this assumption the boundaries of Nejd in the 1913 Convention might well have been fixed so as to include it, with the result that the limits of Nejd would have touched the pre-war limits of Qatar on the coastline at the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, the hinterland (actually the Jafurah Desert) being left in indeterminate ownership. For whatever reason (and it must be assumed that substantial justification was produced to persuade the Turks to relinquish their position in the Barr-al-Qarah) tiie line was m fact fixed farther to the west. But the history of the Barr-al-Qarah, and the fact that the 1913 Convention had never been ratified, may well have been the reasons which led Sir P. Cox in 1922 to fix the limits of Hasa at a point which included m it the Barr-al-Qarah rather than at the blue line of the 1913 Convention. /Conclusions. 19. In the imht of the examination of the position given above, and subject to the observations of the Government of India and the Political Resident, tne best course would appear to be the following (a) Boundaries of Qatar.-—To agree that the boundaries of Qatar shall be accepted as being on the north, east and west, the sea; on the south, a line running across the base of the Peninsula from a point not south of the latitude of the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay to a point not south of the north side of the Khor-al-Odeid inlet. The line indicated on the I.P.C. map would satisfy these criteria, and if it is confirmed that it is the line at present claimed by the Sheikh of Qatar it could be accepted. A slight modification to bring the line some 12 miles south to the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, and. so to reduce the area of sea coast in indeterminate ownership, could be considered if necessaiy. # ^ (b) The blue line of the 1913 Convention, to be maintained as against Ibn Saud, for the reasons given in paragraph 11 above, as the eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia. (c) If a claim is advanced by Ibn Saud to the Barr-al-Qarah' on the ground of the line indicated by Sir Percy Cox in the Oqair conversations in 1922,* referred to in paragraph 6 , that His Majesty’s Government should either (i) concede the claim, on the ground, if necessary, that they regarded themselves as committed by the informal conversations of. 1922, but without prejudice to the maintenance in principle of the blue line, and in return for a formal recognition by Ibn Saud of the validity of this line. The attribution to Ibn Saud of the Barr-al-Qarah area, undesirable as it may be on other grounds, would have the advantage of leaving no gap of indeterminate territory bordering on the sea coast, for we can without difficulty, as suggested in (a) above, recog'nise the frontiers of Qatar as beginning at Dohat-as-Salwa, i.e. at the point at which the Barr-al-Qarah ends. (ii) If it was thought preferable to make no concession in respect of the blue line, then to argue that informal discussions such as those of 1922, which had never been confirmed in writing or been, the subject of formal agreement, had no binding effect, and that His Majesty s Government took their stand on the blue line. Play might be made with the fact that the line drawn by Sir Percy Cox would, in fact, deprive Ibn Saud of a substantial area lying between Djau-ed-Dukhan and the western, side of the blue line. * Gp. on this point paragraph 5 of the Note reproduced as Appendix IY to this Memorandum.(d) The area lying between the blue line and thr 7 • as in (a) above to be reoarded snbwf. ! b( i undaries recognised for Qatar no claim to them is made or emi/r) ! ° c 1 011 ^ rn ! atl0n by the Resident that Dhabi, as of indl^tte 'vne.-shir^t '^ 601 W6St ° f t A f 1 ^ Abu inhospitable desert under Jkhwnn 1 f P ’i ^ a PPears to be largely themselves in it is probablv sm-ill If , 1 .

Boundaries of Qatar. I Extracts from Lorimer’s Gazetteer. (i) Qatar. (N.B. Mr. Lorimer’s article on Qatar is stated to be the result of special enquiries made over a number of years locally.) Lorimer, Vol. II, page 1506, defines the boundaries of Qatar as follows :— On the east, north and west, Qatar is surrounded by the sea. The southern boundary is somewhat indeterminate. It begins at the foot of Dohat-as-Salwa on the western side of the promontory, and from that point runs south-eastwards fi 18 ° 4 i Sak f k V t ^ en ?T ’ a . ccordlD &amp; t0 one account, it strikes east-north- east t° the north end of the Naqiyan sandhills, or, according to another, east by ICW °’m e - f llt J ieril 1 end of the sa me hilJs on the north side of the entrance to Rhor-al- Odaid. As the territory of the Trucial Sheikh of Abu Dhabi has never be ? u asserted t0 extend beyond Khor-al-’Odaid, and as the Al-Thani heikhs of Qatar undoubtedly claim the Naqiyan tract, the latter of the twoalternative lines is to be preferred ; the British Government have recognised Khor-al-’Odaid as belonging to Abu Dhabi and the boundary consequently cannot be placed nearer to Trucial Oman, though the Al-Thani Sheikhs assert a right to the whole coast as far as the Sabakhat Matti. It is said that three men stationed at Dohat-as-Salwa, Sakak and Niqa-al-Maharah, respectively, can wat^fe the whole southern border of Qatar from sea to sea.” (ii) Khor-al- Odaid. In Vol. II on page 1367, Mr. Lorimer describes Khor-al-'Odaid as “ an inlet or creek on the coast of the Abu Dhabi principality as its extreme western end: it lies about 180 miles almost due west from the town of Abu Dhabi. The boundary of Qatar is either at, or a short distance to the north of, the inlet.” (iii) 'Aqal. In Vol. II, pages 88-89, Mr. Lorimer describes ’Aqal as “a small littoral district ■it the base of the Qatar peninsula upon the east side ; it is bounded by Khor-al-Odaia on the north-west and by Dohat-an-Nakharlah on the south-east, the distance betueen which in a direct line is nearly 35 miles. Inland the depth of the district is on an average about 20 miles.” [N.B.-Nathil (Saudah) in Aqal is 20 to 25 miles inland westward, from the foot of Khor-al-’Odaid.] “ On the landward side Aqal is enclosed bv Milan on the east, the Jafurah desert on the south and south-west, .and by Qatar on the north-west. . . . The Bedouins do not regard ’Aqal as geographically included in Oman, which in their view is terminated, on the west by the Sabakhat Matti; but the district has been recognised by the British Qovemment as foiming part of the territories of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and must therefore be considered to belong, in the political sense, to Trucial Oman.” (iv) Aba Dhabi. In Vol. II, page 405, under 11 Abu Dhabi,' Mr. Lorimer remarks: “Upon the coast Abu Dhabi reaches from ... to Khor-al-’Odaid on the west—a distance of over 200 miles. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in 1895 claimed that his frontier extended to the Bay of Umm-al-Hul, near Wakrah in Qatar, but his claim was not approved by the Government of India j Bishainyah has also been named as the limit of his State in this direction, but no good reason has been adduced for supposing that his jurisdiction ever extended beyond Khor-al-’Odaid, though the northern shore of that inlet should perhaps be reckoned as included with the inlet itself in his territories. Inland the frontiers of Abu Dhabi are not defined. It is asserted that on the east they reach to the Baraimi oasis, but without taking it in, and on the south they may presumably be placed at the margin of the Ruba’-al-Khali.” (v) Barr-al-Qarah. Lorimer, II, 1482. “ A coastal tract in Eastern Arabia which may perhaps be reckoned as included in the Sanjaq of llasa [itself, for the. purposes, of the Anglo- Turkish Convention of 1913, included in the Ottoman bandjak of Nejd]. It reaches from Ras-as-Sufairah on the north to the bottom of Dohat-as-Salwa on the south, a distance of about 36 miles ; and inland it extends to a depth of about 12 miles. Upon the coast it meets Barr-al-’Oqair to the north and Qatar to the south of it; and inland, in all directions, it merges in the Jafurah desert. Some authorities would even make Barr-al-’Qarah a part of Jafurah. . . .” (vi) Jafurah. Lorimer, II, 892, describes the Jafurah desert as extending “ the whole way from the Hasa Oasis to the confines of Trucial Oman. ... In shape it is roughly triangular, with its apex on the north almost touching a line drawn between Hofuf and ’Oqair port, and its other corners (to the south-west and south-east) adjoining the Oasis of Jabrin and the southern extremity of Sabakhat Matti respectively. ... On the east it is separated from the sea ” from north to south “ by Barr-al-’Qarah, Qatar, Aqal and Mijan rort the south it is bounded by the Ruba-al-Khali. It may be added here that Jain rah encloses Jabrin upon the north and east and that, in the opinion of some, y Barr-al-’Qarah is a'portion of Jafurah desert and not a separate tract.2 -- sir -r,;; c £„f» “ t ”sr s« « best of His recollection and belief the facts and circumstances were as follows: - •i -ri g specific obiect with which, accompanied by Iraq representatives, I-**, went to meeflbn Sand at Ojair was to induce him to ratify the Mohammerah Agreement of 5th May 1922. Sir Percy proceeded to the rendezvous without tnv knowledge that he would there meet Major Holmes or would have occasion to express fny opinion as to the boundaries of the Qatar Peninsula; but learntag from Major Holmes, and from the map that he produced that he was endeavouring to obtain from Ibn Sand a concession for exploiting oi in an area, which deluded the Qatar Peninsula, he (Sir Percy Cox) naturally informed Major Holmes—and no doubt Ibn Saud also—that this could not be. If he a then been asked as he doubtless must have been, what he considered should be excluded, as instituting Qatar, Sir Percy would undoubtedly have based his answer on his own knowledge, as Resident in the Persian Gulf for ^ny years, namely that on the east coast, Qatar’s boundary with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi s territory was the head of the Khor-al-’Odaid, and on the west coast the head of Salwa p., . iM.p ; n Si r Percy’s recollection, was the position recognised in the Bushire ISdency’and ad^eT by Lorimer in the Persian Gulf Gazetteer. Sir Percy probably y had the Gazetteer with him, but on the above point he would hardly have needed to consult it. In any case he is positive that the Anglo-1 urkish Blue Line of 1913 was never mentioned, and is of opinion that any view which he expressed incidentallv and ex tempore could not reasonably be regarded as the official pronouncement of the Hasa-Qatar boundary contemplated in our first treaty with Ibn Saud (December 1915) in which it figured as one oi those to be heieafter determined.” Moreover, Sir Percy Cox states that he informed both Ibn Saud and Major Holmes that His Majesty’s Government ought to be consulted before any concession was granted. 4 Sir Percy said that in these circumstances it seemed to him that His Majesty s Government were entirely free, in so far as the conversations of 1922 were concerned, to maintain against Ibn Saud the Blue Line of the unratified Anglo-1 urkish Convention of 1913 as the eastern boundary of Nejd. 5 . Sir Percy said he was not aware whether either Ibn Saud or the Sheikh of Qatar had ever advanced a definite claim to the ownership of the Barr-al-Qarah coastal tract, between Zakhmmiyeh and Salwa, but it seemed to him that it occasion arose in the future for a compromise it vrould be a reasonable course to assign to Ibn Saud, in view of his strong position at Ojair close by, that lemgth of coast line- with its hinterland, up to the Blue Line. This would have the advantage of leaving, no indeterminate area along the sea-coast. J Gr L India Office, 27th February 1934.y j ■? 4, . i5@:qn. Jecypher.

February 28th to India Office, Study of further papers received by bag yesterday strengthena my conviction tliat it would be dangerous to define the Southern boundary of Qatar as suggested if it is intended to hold Ibn Saud to blue lino when question of his Eastern frontier arises.. This may happen sooner than we anticipate for either or both of the following reasons: (1) Oil concession granted last year to Standard Oil of California may include expressly or implicitly the country East of the blue line. (2) Sheikh of -..atar may already have come to an understanding with Ibn Baud on the basis of their having a common frontier. Even if Ibn Baud admitted successor ship to Turks he would in my opinion read Article 11 and Article 3 of Anglo Turkish conventions of 1913 and 1914 respectively as implying that Nejd and Qatar were coterminous territories and he might well argue adoption by His Majesty’s Go.vernment of boundary now suggested for Qatar constituted renunciation of blue line. He could be all the more tempted to assertjr\ n this view as he has in tact exercised authority East of line not only in manner described in India Office memorandum of January 26th but by creation of Ikhwan settlement end by despatch of expeditions mentioned in my despatches NOol09j 165 and 312 of 1932c He could argue these were matters of public knowledge which had not been challenged. It would doubtless be easy to elaborate countor argumentSo light of Sheikh of Qatar to alien territory could be denied but would it not be extremely embarrassing if the question arose over proceedings of Standard Oil Company geologists who are very active am might be backed by the United States Government unless His Majesty's Government were in a position to claim that territory East of blue line was not merely outside Saudi Arabia but was in a recognised British sphere of influenco?

They could not, without establishing a regular defensive system on the frontier, which they cannot contemplate, give an assurance that in no circumstances would any small hostile force be alk wed to cross the Qatar boundary, and they canhot accept liability for meeting minor raids. Moreover, here, as in Kcweit, they would of course expect the Sheikh to take reasonable steps for his own defence and for maintaining order within his own borders... If, as His Majesty's Government hope, a guarantee within these limits will satisfy the Sheikh, they suggest that it might be in the following terms: 'Thao in the event of any serious and unprovoked attac* His Majesty's Government will come to his assistance and maintain th© ind©p©nd©nc© of his Stat© '^ His Majesty's Government have considered as an alternative, an.assurance on the lines of the Kowei~ u formula o' 1914, i„e O0 that Qatar shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection Thi seems unlikely to satisfy the Sheikh, since His Majesty's Government are already in treaty relations with him as' an independent ruler, while the-term 'protection* thus used might alarm him by suggesting the idea of a Protectorate,, If, however, the Resident thinks that the Sheikh would preier it, either alone or with addition of formula suggested above, he may use it so long as it is clearly understood by the Sheikh that the assurance of protection does not, ,, v . eyo^d the limit® specified in paragraph 1 abo ? e 3= It would of course be essential to obtain from the Sheika, in return for any guarantee given, the facilitiea required by the Royal Air Force to enable the guarantee to be irapier » i.e., probably two landing grounds and freedom of movement for the necessary British personnel,.

Ibn Saud is always loath to accept theory that he is a successor to Turks whom he would regard as usurpers not entitled to alienate his ancestral right He might for present political reasons accept blue line but only I think if States under what amounts to British protection came up to it on other side. I do not consider any distinction can be made between Saudi Government and Ilchwan who were Ibn Saud 1 s creation. Ibn Saud almost certainly regards Murra tribe as his sub jects; see my despatch ^ 32 of^ February 27th 1932, I believe he has sent 2^prim^4-ve expeditions against them in last 3 years© He has also created Ikhwan settlements in tnoir country including those rt Sinak end Anbak mentioned in Philby 1 s 'Empty quarter', page 50. Murra settlements one of which was apparently Sikak were represented at Ikhwan comerence at Riyacm in 192c.

INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL ETtii February 1934. Ivy dear Warner, I write with further reference to your letter of Utli February, No. S.732/279/91, about Qatar boundaries, to say that, as arranged, I discussed with sir Percy Cox on 20th February the conversations reported in Dickson’s confidential despatch of 4th July last, No.143, to have taaen place between Sir Percy, ibn Saud and Major Holmes in 1922. I now enclose a note of tne discussion, which has oeen largely drafted by sir Percy Cox himself and which is, I think, self-explamtory. regards the last paragraph of the note, the efiect of attributing not only the Barr-al-Qarah, but its hinterland, to Ibn Saud would, of course, be for practical purposes to move the Blue Line to the east to the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay.

Sir Percy proceeded to the rendezvous without any knowledge that he would there meet Major Holmes or would have occasion tv express any opinion as to the boundaries of the Qatar Peninsula ; but learning from Ma- -jor Holmes , and from the map that he pro- -duced,that he was endeavouring to obtain from Ibn Saud a concession for exploiting oil in an area which included the. Qatar Penii -sula , he ( Sir Percy Cox ) naturally infor -med Major Holmes — and no doubt ibn Saud also — that this could not be . If he had then been asked , as he doubtless must have29 been , what he considered should be exclude^ ^ as constituting Qatar , Sir Percy would have undoubtedly^based his answer on his own Knowledge , as Resident in the Persian Gulf! for many years ; namely that,on the east coast, Qatabis; boundary with the Shaikh of Abu Thabl 1 s territory was the head of the Khor-al~Odaid , and on the west coast the head of S a iwa Bay . This , in Sir Percy*s recollection , was the position recognised in the Bushire Residency and adopted by Lorimer in the Persian Gulf Gazetteer . Sir Percy probably had the Gazetteer with him , b ut p n the above point he would hardly have needed consult it • in any case he is positive that the Anglo-Turkish Blue Line ct of 1013 was never mentioned , and is of op. -inion that any view which he expressed in- -cidentally and ex tempore could not rea- -sonably be regarded as the official pro- -nouncement of the Hasa-Qatar boundary con* -templated in our first treaty with Ibn oreover Sir Percy Cox states \Saud (Dec.l9i5) in which it figured as one^ that he informed both Ibn \ Saud and Major Holmes that % &gt;of those to be ' hereafter determined ”.

He was in these circumstances of opinion, as stated above, thiit were entirely free so far as the 1922 conversations were concerned to maintain the Blue Line of the unratified An^lo- Turklsh Convention of 1913 as the Eastern boundary of Mejd against Xbn Gaud. If a compromise were ior any reason at any future time to be considered desirable* there might be something to be saia for attributing to Bin Saua the Barr-al-Qarah area, the hinterland remaining indeterminate In ownership* this would have the advantage of leaving no indeterminate area along the sea coast.1 r GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Department, L— o* O 4 f _ j * j ESS LETTER leceipt.

Pr. J1 llianison*s note is a clear and accurate statement of fact and agrees with what I myself know of 'iatar and its histoiy* 4. I did not know that the exact boundary line, cs claimed by Ibn ihani ran as Mr.iilliamson says it does: I was under the impression that it started from Salwa fort, and ran south to AHBAK wells and. then turned due Bast to the Pea, south of the Khor GDAID. As Mr.Williamson knows the geography of , ( atsr far better than I do, I think we must assume that what he says in this matter is correct. 5. Incidentally, and as I have already mentioned in another letter which I sent you sometime back, the existing Government map (Million Bheet) gives the depth of the Bay of Galwa quite wrongly. It runs much further2 further south than marked ^ in fact the true position of ^esr Salwa, is only a little north of an Ksst and lest line running through Khor al odaid. The best existing sjap to consult that I know of is that prepared by jhr.Thi Iby and which accoinpaniea his book ter/ 1, , although even be does not mention label al h-iK&amp;h fi conical hill a little north of %asr oalwa. ^ I understand also that ‘tir.Cox of the ii.P.O.G., Ltd., was able to make a sketch map the hinterland of qatar, which could be studied pith advantage. 6* xts regards the political situation existing bot- wean T Tis rajasty King Bin ..nud and the Ruler of ^atar; I agree with every word that ;:.r. Williamson soys, and it is bora&amp; out by what I have heard in Kuwait during the last year or so* In xay opinion Bin Laud definitely claims the ^atar peninsular, and will go on doing so, so long as we do not move with the times and adopt a policy there* All the in formation that I have been able to get from Riath, from time to time bears out exactly what Mr.Williamson says in this respect. It is practically certain that Bin Baud warned the Shaikh of w.atar on the latter f s recent visit to the Capital that he expected him to give any Oil Concession that migjit be going, to his friends, the Americans and not the British. He went, I believe, further, and tola him, in &amp; diplomatic way, of course, that only DOHAH could be con sidered as belonging to the Ibn THAJil’ family and that the rest of the peninsular was his* Certainly &lt;,11 the Bedouins of Haase look upon the ^/atar desert (Bar ai „atr} as belong ing to Bin Baud, ana I only got this confiitnen 3 days ago (lb. 1*34) by an ^ijman ohaikh, wno is now In Kuwait. /hen I asked him guardedly, if he knew the boundary between Saudiyob end the Shsikh of Qatar’s territory, he promptly replied, 'There is no boundary, Bin Baud rules 1 Bar al AAtr’A - 3 - ^atr- (the desert of Qatari, and Ibn Ohani rule.

Bin 3aud e V .»n we nt so far, some years ago, aa to claim all 'Iraq nomad tribes, as well ao aU Kwmlt Bedouins up to the mlln of Kuwait, until the Ojair Oon- feronce of 1983 put a definite boundary line between him and his northern neighbours and forced him to drop thees ide-s. To this day, however, in any public uttsronces he m8k ' 3 to his N *J d Bedouins, Bin Baud tells them that nil the Bedouin of Arabia (Eadia) are his, and his neighbours only hold the Towns. This is a regular trick of his to gain their allogiance and impress, 9. As regards the question of how to bring it home to ::'in 'iauci that we consider mi tar State to be independent of Saudi Arabia, and that we will not stand by and see Ibn fhani coerced in any way, where Oil or other questions are concerned; I do not consider the problem presents many difficulties, but w® must tackle it at once , other wise ithe xiiaerleans will get into Aatar for a certainty, and that principality will pass under the suzerainty of Bin Baud, 1 r i 10. In my opinion the procedure should be as follows; His Majesty’s Government should without further delay add ress a friendly but firm note to Bin Baud embodying the following points:- (a) That he was definitely told by Bir Percy Cox at Ojair in 192d (I was present at the interview) when Major Holmes tried to include ^atar in his Hassa Oil Concession with his, BinBln Gaud's, approval, that ,.atar was an indepen- dent iitata under our protection. (b) That he, Bin Jaud, was further told by Gir Percy Cox that he had no rights in „atar what soever and so could not give away what did not belong to him. (c) That as he never raised any objection at the time or since to Sir 1ercy Cox’s pronounce ment, Hie Majesty’s Government considered the matter as definitely settled. (d) That in^view of His Majesty’s Government the time hod now come to officially demorcate the frontier line as between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as had been done with Transjordan, ’Iraq and Kuwait and to that end invited him, Bin Saud, to admit the correctness of the boundary and Keutral ^one as claimed by the Ruler of Qatar by an exchange of notes. 11. Bin Maud could reply in three ways. Either (a) he would agree out of hand, or (b) deny that Ibn Thani’s boundary was the right one, and ask for a boundary com mission to fix the boundary: or (c) he would deny our ri&amp;ht to interfere, and claim the whole of vatar as having come to him when he drove the Turks out of the Hassa Province, ^atar having formed part of that province according to the Turks. In any case Bin Saud will have to show his hand and His Majesty’s Government will know how to make the next move. 12. It is of great importance that a copy of the letter which we send to Bin Gaud, should be given to Ibn Than!, and that he be given to understand that we mean business and that having settled his boundary officially with Bin Gaud for him wa mean to assist him if necessary by force to defend it against all aggression. This mustThis must be thoroughly got into his mind, and be backed by a written promise on our part to afford such suuport, with the present development of our Air Force, there should be no difficulty in doing this* IS* Knowing Bin o&amp;ud as I do, I believe that when he is clearly made to realise that we intend to defend Qatar’s land boundaries in case of necessity, he will ac cept the situation at once as he did in the case of ’Iraq and Kuwait. 14. that we must not do - and this is th© crux of the whole matter - is to leave the situation as it is now, that is to say unsettled and in fluid state. If we do, the astute Bin Baud will at once take full advantage of our l&amp;isseg faire attitude and by means of bluff and bombast where we are concejrned, and by secret pressure and tribal irx t' cl } radio into Qatar (he denying responsibility all the time) where Ibn Than! is concerned, will gain all his points, and force Ibn Than! to acknowledge that he is the power that counts, and can do things, whilst His Majesty’s Government is not. Ibn Than! will then, whilst outwardly ’keeping in’ with us, surrender his hinterland to Bin Baud and give any Oil Concession that may b® going to Bin Baud’s proteges, the *unericons, on the plea that theirs was the better offer. 15. Bven if we are successful by diplomatic methods in keeping the Standard Oil of California out of Qatar, the shaikh of that State will never give the concession to the I.F.C., or a.P.O.C., unless we can give him an as surance that w© intend defending his land frontiers, and will sec him through any and every quarrel that Bin Baud may choose to pick with him in th© future. 16. It should not be forgotten - and I state this as a well known and curious fact - that everyone of the Arabian Coastal Bmirates in the Persian Gulf, have got it deeply fixed in their minds that in some way or other BinBin baud can brin^f unduo influenoo to bear on His Majesty’s Government and got His Majesty’s Government to back him and settle any differences in his favour, if it is a case of Bin baud or themselves. They are all suffering from a Bin baud inferiority complex today, and we will not succeed in bettering matters, until we eradicate this idea and make them believe that we ore prepared to stand by them, whatever form aggression from their ’big* brother takes.

The Ueutral Zone and the frontier between Z&amp;tar and the Oman tribes is recognised by all, but that between ^atar and the .,audi Government is only recognised as on sufferance from IBH 3IJJD • Ibn TEtil^I is a merchant prince, he derives his power from wealth accumulated by his father and grand-father from pearling and trading. These Arab merchant princes loan out ^(money to thair relations and to others who are settled in their district, collecting only a percentage on the profits and bearing the losses in most cases. In return the receive the service and allegiance of these merchants, who are all more or lees indebted to them. Ibn THAN! other than the sixty odd members of hishis/family, has no tribe which he can claim as his own in ^atar* Chere are a few scattered semi Jornada of the lhiLl “ tribe on peninsula dating back to the time of the BINI MUbLIti who were the rulers in ^at&amp;r before the Ihani family. Ibn TIUNI depends for his fighting force on men drawn from the BXHI iliUTiui and the BISX MURRa, two of the three tribes pasturing along the border of % atar. 'fhe third tribe is ©1-M0KA3IR. Ibn TBMII is definitely dependent on the good will of Ibn Baud and his EAS8A GoTemor, Ibn JALLOUI, for the safety of his lands from the raids of the Kejd tribes, especially from the MANABIR. I believe it Irks Ibn THAII! to be so much de pendant for his safety on ibn Baud, but to strengthen himself by hiring a body of mercenaries from the tribe© of BINI HA$JAR and AL MlfRIUi, other than the few dozen men he has at present, would cost him much and more than he eouli well afford. / The income of Ibn THAR I, as I have said before, &gt; is derived from, pearling, and from monies lent out to traders on the ' percentage from the profit ' basis. This percentage varies from 5 ,v to 25 a. Generally if on the 5 A from the trader makes good any losses from the capital lent; but if on the 25 &gt; basis the lender suffers any legi timate loss to the capital. Ibn TBAMl draws a small income from Dohah Customs but not enough to cover the upkeep of the Government and Town guarda. Customs charged are 4 ad valorem. No income is deBived from the grazing and the Bedouin tribes of BMI H4HAK, MUBHA, and MiBASXR graze as they wish, except in one or two areas, which are set aside for the herds of Ath Than!. 5 .

It is now e ruin without one inhabitant, Ibn THAI:I, during the liirkish regime held the title of aAB'AKAL and Qatar came under the LiKTiaSA - IF I AH of HAbAA. At one time he drew a small subsidy from the T’orks. Ibn THiu* 4 l, as I have mentioned is dependent on the good will of the Saudi Government 'or the safety of his state from Bedouin raids. Lately when ha visited Ibn Baud at Riyadh, it is said that he was told that .atar tfas part of the Saudi Kingdom, and that he only held POHAE, eind the adjoining towns on sufferance of Ibn saud, also that the Bau&lt; i Govemment looked upon the idea of a British company having an oil concession in H.at&amp;r with disfavour and if anyone was to be given a concession in Qatar it must be the ^uaericans. The foregoing is the least Ibn Baud was reportedreported to have said to Ibn TThiNl. It is almost oortHin in view of Ibn Sand's claim over Ibn TILUU ana tt»it if Ibn THAKI is allowed to give the oil concession to the .aerict ns, it will be tanta mount to acknowledging Ibn Gaud's definite suzerainty over Qatar* if Ibn TiliUlI were promised protection of bis country from Ibn Saud and especially from raids from the Bedouins on his borders, I feel that he would be incline in fact be very glad to be an independent ruler enc to be in a position to act as he thought fit with regards to the concession, especially as under the present circumstances, no matter to whom Ibn THAN I gives the concession Ibn Send will expect a large share of the proceeds for protecting Qatar from his own Bedouins* Lid. a.F. ./ill ism son.

Dat e ^ Hew Delhi, the 3/^ January 1934 * Bouniaries of Qatar. 1 f! Sir With reference to correspondence ending with the express letter from the Hon* ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Ho# 1934-3 of 1933, dated the 18th December 1933, copy of ^hich was sent to you direct, I am directed to say that as His I3ajesty*s Secretary of state for India is aware on the east, north and west Qatar is surrounded by the sea and it is the southern boundary alone which requires determination. The records of the Government of India throw little light on the subject and it is unfortunate that the Political Resident has not been able to get the Sheikh* s own views. 2. The boundaries of Qatar are described inLorimer*s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf (Volume II, Page 1506), and in his letter Ho. 143,dated the 4th July 1933, Colonel Dickson, Political Agent, Kuwait, has suggested a different southern boundary line. 3. Both Mr. Lorimer and Colonel Dickson are of opinion that the boundary line begins at the foot of Dohat*a s-Salwa on the western side of the promontory. They however differ as to thethe place in the interior through which the line passes am also as to its terminus. According to Coloml Dickson it pasaes through Habak (Anbak as he calls it ). The only authority in support of this suggestion is the statement n«de by sir Percy Cox on his return from the Ojair Conference at the end of 1922 that Ibn Saud had agreed to the boundary lire between Hejd and Qatar passing just east of J&amp;bak. In the absence however of any written communication from Ibn saud m confirmation of this statement, the Government of India are not disposed to accept Colonel Dickson's suggestion and are of opinion that unless Ibn Saud's concurrence is now obtained the line should be regarded as running south-eastwards from the foot of Dohat-as-salwa to the wells of sakak as given in the Ga zetteer. 4* ColoDel Dickson has suggested Khor-al-Dhmvaihin as the terminus of the boundary on the eastern side of the promontory. A line drawn from the sakak wells to Khor-al*Dhuwaihin will include in the territories of the Sheikh of qatar^ Khor-al- Odaid and a portion of coast to its south. This however does not seem to be correct since in 1903 it was held that M from and inclusive of Khor-al-Odaid southward the coast belongs to the Trucial Chiefs*, vide paragraph 3 of letter from the Government of India in the Foreign Department to His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, Haval Forces* East Indian Station, Ho. 1209-S,dated 5th June 1903 a copy of which was sent to His Ifejesty* s Secretary of State for India under Foreign Department despatch Ho. 86 of 1903, dated the 2nd July 1903. In view of this. Colonel Dickson’s sugge st ion appears unacceptable and the Government of India are of opinion that from Sakak wells the line runs eastward by south to the southern end of the Ha qiyanHa qiyan sandhills on the north side of the entrance to Khor al-Odaid a s described in the Gazetteer. .^;V I have the honour to be» Sir, Your .:aoat obedient servant.

To The Hon 1 hie the Political Aesiuent in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Boundarie s of ATAB, Sir, With reference to your No. 718-S, dated the 24th June 1933 and paragraph 5, I have the honour to confirm that I was present at the Ojair negotiations held between Sir Percy Cox and the then Sultan of Nejd (now H.M.King Abdul aziz as Saud) from November 27th to 2nd December 1922. 2. I perfectly well remember the incident referred to in Baghdad NoIO/lO, dated the 19th January 1923 to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, copy of which you have now sent me. 3. It happened after Sir Percy Cox had, after a five days personal struggle with Bin Saua, got his own way in the matter of the Iraq - Nejd frontier line, and Bin Saud was in very chastened mood in consequence. 4. The question of Major Holmes Hassa Concession had Just corae up for discussion, before the conference broke up (Major Holmes was himself present); and Bin Saud had produced before Sir Percy Cox, Hungers map of Arabia 1 f to 32 miles, which, if my memory serves me right, belonged to Major Holmes. On it was marked in blue pencil, the area which Bin Saud proposed to grant to the Eastern and General Syndicate for their concession. This area includedthe whole of the Hassa province and the $atar peninsula - the south western and southern boundary of the concession being marked on the map by a line drawn down the Wadi Faruq as far as Jaw al Dukhan and then turning East from there to Khor ii.d Dhuwaihin on the sea. Sir/5* Sir Percy ^ox, ?/hen he saw how the proposed line was made to include Q,atar, urew a red pencil line from Jaw al Dukhan to Dohat Salwa, (the heaa of the hay to the south of Bahrain Isl nd) and said 'tmt is the line'. He subsequently cro seo. out with the same red pencil the line as marked in by Major .tiolmes, i,e, to IChor Ad Dhuwaihin, 6. as far as I remember, Sir Percy Cox showed considerable annoyance b.t this barefaced attempt on the par of both Major Holmes and Bin Baud, to bluff him, and explained to the latter that on no account eoula he include in any concession any of the country lying to the East of 'AHBAX' (not MABAiC as mentioned in Hunters map, though it is the same place). This indeed is borne out by Bushir e Ho,947-S, dated the 20th December 1922, to the Political Agent, Bahrain, copy of which has been sent me.' * T' J&gt; Id n f 3*0 Register No. ' ‘ / 410* SECRET.

The position is examined in some detail in the provisional interdepartmental note attached which, after a review cu its history, makes the suggestions as to the line to oe adopted summarised in paragraphs 9 and 19 . Copies of the note have been sent informally to the .foreign Office under the letter of which a copy is attached. Copies have also gone to Colonel Powle anu to the Government of India. If the general line suggested in tne note commends itself to higher authority here and in tne Foreign Office the Sesident and the Government of India might be asked for an expression of their viev\supon it. most important point is the attitude t^ he adopted in regard to the area lying between the boundary which the Sheikh of Qatar now appears to ^Iciim and the clue line of the 1913 Convention. There i s to oe said for regarding the intervening area as politically indeterminate so long as possible and cu avoiding raising with Ton Saud^ quest ion# which bound to be difficult and controversial of his rights to the east of the blue line. On the other hand, we may oe untLOle to avoid raising those questions. Apart from that there is some danger, in leaving the patch of sea coast between the point where the blue line reaches the sea una the western extremity of the boundary of Qatar as a no-man*s-land } that foreign powers// CCZC Ur ^ UA^iy'l^-Z 7 £k iAt 2 . / :! '■! MM powers might endeavour to establish themselves m or might at any rate question our rights to exercise influence over it. The alternative solutions are to attdbute the Barr-al-Qarsii to Ibn Baud, the Qatar boundary to begin where the Barr-al-Qarah ends, or to be prepared to claim (basing ourselves to some extent on the wording of the 1913 Convention) that the boundary of Qatar, or,as a pis aller , the Q^tar sphere of influence, extends so far to the west as the olue line. The point is, of course, one of considerable importance in connection with the proposal separately submitted that we shoulu agree to offer protection to the sheikh of Qa.tar in return for an undertaking on his part to grant the oil concession for his State to the A.P.O.C.

I am now asked to let you know that we are in general agreement with the suggestions made in the note by you enclosed in your letter; but we have asked Ryan in my letter of the 1st February, of which you have already had a copy, for his observations on any points concerning Ibn Baud, and pending those observations we cannot naturally give final concurrence. On one point in particular we have some doubts pending further considera tion on the receipt of Ryan’s views, namely the question of the line to be taken if Ibn Saud bases a claim to the Barr-al-Qarah on tne line indicated to him by Sir Percy Cox in 1922.

Copies are being sent to the Foreign Office, and are being submitted here, for consideration: but at tne moment it is purely provisional and has no approval Go. niggler auonority behind it. Since it was written, we have neard from the Anglo Persian Oil Company that according to one member (Haji A.P.Williamson) of the Geological party which visited Qauar in February and March 193C, the Southern boundary line shown on their map was indicated by the Shaikh and it looks therefore as though we can with reasonable confidence assume tnat this is his own view at the present time of his southern boundary. This should go a long way to clear the air, though it will leave us with tne difficult problems of the attitude to be adopted in respect of the area between the Sheikh's line and the blue line of the 1913 Convention.

I find that the boundariesof Kuwait were fixed at a Conference held in November and December,1922, between Sir Percy Cox ana Ibn Saud, the Political Agent of Kuwait also being present. The boundaries agreed upon at this Conference were accepted by the Shaikh of Kuwait on the 26th January,1923; the official description of the southern boundary of Kuwait is as follows From the function of the Wadi Au^ah (near Shiqayya) in a straight line to the function of the 29th parallel with the old circle delimiting Kuwait; thence the boundary follows the old circle to the Persian Gulf at Has al-Q,ali-yah (as shown on our map).

On the south-western extremity of the Qatar boundary there has been no corresponding dispute, nor is there a fixed point equally definitely established which can with confidence be regarded as marking the western limit of the territories of Qatar. The Position prior to the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. 4. The southern boundary of Qatar was closely investigated locally between 1904 and 1907 by experienced political officers in connection with the compilation of Mr. Lorimer’s “Persian Gulf Gazetteer.” The result of their inA'estigation is given in the extract from the Gazetteer reproduced as item I (i) in the Appendix to this note. Broadly speaking, it went to show that the southern boundary of the State ran south-east from Dohat-as-Salwa to a point to the north of the Khor-al-Odeid. Over the first section, running irom Dohat-as-Salwa to the Wells of Sakak, there was no dispute. The boundary between the Wells of Sakak and the sea on the eastern side of the Qatar Peninsula was, however, indeterminate. Two alternatives (the difference at its widest point being some 20 miles) were reported by Lorimer. For the reasons given by him (and substantially based on the historical considerations referred to in paragraph 2 above) he regarded the second alternative as preferable. The effect of its acceptance would be that the eastern sector of the southern Qatar boundary would run south-east from the Wells of Sakak to the sea north of the Khor-al-Odeid. * Not reproduced. 2560 12 2.34P.Z. 299/34.

Discussion over the years 1911-13, between the Turkish Government and His Majesty’s Government on the various matters in dispute between them in the Persian Gulf area culminated in the latter year in the signature oh two Conventions defining inter alia the eastern limits of Turkish authority in Arabia. The Couventif of 29th July 1913, which defined the eastern .boundary of Nejd, is alone relevant for the present purpose. Under that Convention, which, though reference is made to it in the ratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 9th March 1914, was never itself ratified, the eastern boundary of the Turkish Sanjaq of Nejd was defined by a blue line on the map running due south from the head of the bay opposite Zaqnuniyeh island in the Persian Gulf to the 20th parallel of latitude in the Central Arabian Desert. The text of the relevant article is given in section II of the Appendix attached to this Note. Its wording (“ une ligne . . . separera le Nedjd de la presqu’ile d’El Katr. Les limites du Nedjd sont indiquees par une ligne bleue . . . ”) would justifv the contention that the blue line was at once the eastern frontier of Nejd and the western frontier of Qatar. But there are definite objections to adopting this view. In the first place, there is nothing to show that this was, in fact, the intention of His Majesty’s Government at the time when the Convention was concluded, or that they had any object beyond limiting the eastern boundary of the Turkish possessions in this area. Secondly, there is no evidence of any claim to suzerainty by Qatar so far to the west or so far to the south. Thirdly, the Resident’s telegram of 11th January 1934, T. 19, emphasises the absence of control by the Sheikh of Qatar over the interior of his State (and a fortiori over regions so remote from Dohah as are now under consideration). Fourthly (though this by itself is probably not of serious importance) the position vis-a-vis I bn Saud is to some extent compromised, as explained below, at any rate as regards the Barr-al-Qarah, by the line fixed by Sir Percy Cox in 1922. Fifthly, it is arguable that even in a formal document such as the 1913 Convention, the fact that the blue line is spoken of separating Nejd from the Qatar Peninsula, need not be regarded as determining the boundary of Qatar. The Qatar Peninsula was the closest prominent geographical feature and the nearest adjoining Arab political entity on the mainland, and a reference to it for descriptive purposes was not unnatural. Finally, there is much to be said for giving no avoidable extensions to the boundaries of Qatar, even if the consequence is that we have to deal with an area of indeterminate ownership between those boundaries and the blue line. Line indicated in 1922 by Sir P. Cox to Ibn Saud and Major Holmes as the Eastern Limit of any Oil Concession in respect of Hasa. 6. One more incident of importance should be recorded before coming to the latest evidence as to the view held by the Sheikh of Qatar as to his southern boundary. The incident is that reported in Colonel Dickson's letter of 4th July 1933, No. 143, to the Political Resident, copies of which were received under the Political Resident’s express letter of 18th December 1933, No. 1934 S.; when Sir Percy Cox, then High Commissioner for Iraq, in a discussion at Oqair in 1922 with Ibn Saud, then Sultan of Nejd, and Major Holmes, warned both the Sultan and Major Holmes that the Sultan could grant no concession, and Major Holmes receive none from him, in respect of the Principality of Qatar, and drew on a map a line running from Djau*ed-Dukhan to Dohat-as-Salwa, which, he indicated, must represent the eastern boundary of any concession granted by Ibn Saud in respect of Hasa. Such a line, as will be seen from the map, excludes the whole Qatar Peninsula (and incidentally a substantial area lying to the west of the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention). It also includes in Hasa an area to the east of the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention. It should, however, be noted that while it constituted a definite indication of the High Commissioner’s view as to the eastern boundary of Hasa, it in no way specifically defined the boundaries of Qatar save in so far as Qatar might be regarded as marching with Hasa and Nejd, or might be regarded as having been granted a western frontier bounded by the blue line of the 1913 Convention at the time when that Convention was concluded. 7. The statement reported in Bushire Memorandum No. 947 S. of 20th December 1922 to have been made by Sir P. Cox that Ibn Saud had agreed with Sir P. Cox, in 1922 that the boundary line between Nejd and Qatar should follow a line running due south from the end of the bay south of Bahrein Island and just east of Mabak as shown on Fraser-Hunter s map, stands by itself, as such an arrangement was nevei*. 5 srArZgcgt Sr, si' ° K r'’ -*»* . ■•“'M 7 -% ,*i * -.v .ssrstf;” rtsas ?*•«» &lt;rri X'SSMr&amp;e; ‘i: .■« = ~ 'hamtam the independence of the sheikhdoms of the ^nh hdt 0 ^^ 11 WaS f, h]efl - y to The statement is, no doubt, an alternative version of Sir P tJ^ 1 a ^ amst ^n Saud. as to the eastern boundary of any concession to be o-rmitAH f x ® warnm § to Ibn Saud discussed in the preceding paragraph of which fn « m res r )ect of Hasa personal knowledge is given in Colonel Dickson’s letter of 4 tk July lysT^HS. ^ I.P.C.

If the me in fact represents his view, the boundary, as will'be seen will correspond very closely to the pre-war line recorded by Lorimer. Conclusions as to the Southern Boundary of Qatar. 9. It is suggested, in the light of the evidence collected above — (a) that the south-eastern boundary of Qatar must lie to the north of the .Kdior-al-Odeid and the district of Aqal; (b) that while His Majesty’s Government had at no stage formally recognised any specific southern boundary to Qatar (save to the extent referred to in pz)), such evidence as is available goes to show that the pre-war boundary ran roughly south-east across the base of the Peninsula, from Dohat-as-Salwa, or a point slightly north of it, to a point north of the Khor-al-Odeid. Theie is no recorded evidence of any more extensive claims by the Sheikh of Qatar other than those to Abu I)habi territory referred to in paragraph 2 above ; (c) in the light of the above, that, if it proves that the Sheikh of Qatar now regards the line shown on the I.P.C. map as his southern boundary, this may be accepted by His Majesty’s Government as generally satisfactory. Acceptance of that line, if we continue to regard the blue line of the 1913 Convention as the eastern boundary of Ibn Saud’s territories (or even if we were to agree to the attribution of the Barr-aT Qarah district lying east of the blue line to Hasa (see paragraph 18 below)), will admittedly leave an area of undetermined ownership between Qatar and Nejd. The problems involved in this are discussed in greater detail in paragraphs 10 and following. If, however, His Majesty’s Government are prepared to face them, the boundary in question has the merits that it is consistent with the obligations we have undertaken to Abu Dhabi; it is equally consistent with the maintenance of the blue line of the 1913 Convention as against Ibn Saud (or with such a modifi cation of that line as is referred to in paragraph 19 (c) (i) below; and it has the advantage of defiuitely limiting the area of any commitments in respect of protection, &amp;c., into which His Majesty’s Government may think it desirable to enter in the event of an oil concession being granted by the Sheikh.Position of Area lying between Base of Qatar Peninsula and Blue Line of Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. 10 If in these circumstances, it is accepted that the southern boundary of Qatar should be a line running via or to the north of Sakak more or less south-east from Dohat-as-Salwa or a point slightly to the north of Dohat-as-Salwa to a point to t( north of the Khor-al-Odeid, the difficult question arises of the position of the country lying between such a line and the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. Importance of Maintaining the Blue Line. H Oh the one hand, it appears definitely important if possible to maintain the blue line laid down in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as against Ibn Saud or any other future ruler of this part of Arabia. While the 1913 Convention was never ratified, the blue line at any rate represents the agreement reached at the time between Turkey and His Majesty’s Government as to the limits of Turkish authority in northern Arabia and on the Persian Gulf, and in dealing with Ibn Saud as the successor in title to the Turks we can, it would seem, not unreasonably take our stand on it. The difficulties of finding any satisfactory substitute are patent. The undesirability of giving Ibn Saud, in the absence of any definite eastern boundary to his territories, an excuse for territorial expansion (as distinct from the exercise, as at present, of an informal influence and the receipt from our Arab clients of payments which we do not recognise and the existence of which we ignore) in the hinterland of the Trucial Coast and of Muscat is equally clear. Such expansion would clearly involve a risk either of his coming into conflict with the local rulers, whose treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government he has formally lecognised, or of : his establishing an influence in the Sheikhdoms in question so powerful as to be embarrassing from our point of view, it is Tclovant, finally, that- confidential infor mation suggests—that Ibu Saird^-doeS'iIothimself at the nronreirPaeriously question the Jiliie linmi Disadvantages of Maintenance of the Blue Line while fixing Southern Boundary of Qatar at the Base of the Qatar Peninsula. 12. At the same time, important on general grounds, for the reasons given, as the maintenance of the blue line appears to be, the fact must be faced that in the present case, if we continue to regard it as the eastern boundary of Ibn Sand’s territory, and if, as suggested, we accept a southern boundary lor Qatar running roughly across the base of the Qatar Peninsula, a not inconsiderable area lying between the two States, and peopled by migratory Bedouin tribes, will be left in an indeterminate political position. There is a possibility that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who has in the past exercised a wide influence, and made tribal alliances of his own, in the trucial hinterland—c/. Sir P. Cox’s letter No. 176 of 28th June 1904—might prefer some claim to such an area. But, though on this point further information will be sought from the Besident, there seems little evidence of any active interest on the part of Abu Dhabi in any area to the west of Aqal. Assuming that no such claim exists, or could be substantiated, the alternatives are to recognise the area as belonging to Ibn Saud ; to recognise it as belonging to the Sheikh of Qatar ; or to regard it as a political no-man’s land. 13. If we recognised it as belonging to Ibn Saud we could, if necessary, call upon him to-keep Bedouin raids into Qatar from it under control. But such recognition would not merely be inconsistent with the maintenance of the blue line of the 1913 Convention, to the abandonment of which, as stated above, the objections appear to be strong, but would represent a formal acceptance of Saudi sovereignty to the borders or Qatar and Abu Dhabi Avhich might well prove embarrassing. 14. If, on the other hand, it is attributed to the Sheikh of Qatar, we should be justified in expecting the full co-operation of the Sheikh in dealing with Bedouin activities within its limits. But such an attribution would not merely to give to Qatar a substantial area which she does not in the past appear to have claimed, but would extend the limits of any liability for protection which we may undertake in connection with the grant of an oil concession. It might be necessary to claim the area (or at any rate its coastal strip) for Qatar if there were serious signs of foreign interest in it or of an intention on the part of Ibn Saud to occupy it. But pending such developments it seems wiser to limit our commitments and to avoid any extension of the area recognised by us as Qatar.15.

Conditions of the Indeterminate Area. 16. Before reaching a conclusion it maybe well to place on record such scanty information as is available about the nature and the political conditions of the indeterminate area. Apart from the coastal district known as the Barr-al-Qarah which is further discussed m paragraph 13 below, the bulk of it appears to belong to the Jafurah desert, which Lorimer describes as an area “possessing only a few wells,of very bitter water, a ittle scanty grazing, with a surface of red and burning WII sand, in which living conditions are extremely difficult and which is frequented 3 ' “to any considerable extent’ only by “the hardy A1 Uorrah, and even they avoid entering it unless in winter or m search of a refuge from more powerful enemies” (cf. Appendix, section I (vi)). Since the date of Lorimer’s Gazetteer, Mr. Bertram Thomas, on ms recent crossing of the Rub-al-Khali, has passed through this area from south to north, travelling from the well of Banaiyan near Latitude 23° 11' 40' via Haluwain, Nakhala, and the western extremity of a salt lake lying immediately west ol the Khor-al-Odeid, across the pre-war Qatar frontier to Dohah. His account is of importance because it makes it clear that such local control as is exercised is exercised solely by nomad Bedouin tribes (and principally the A1 Murra, who 'are a tribe dwelling in the sands, whose influence extends well down into the Rub-al-Khali) Secondly, even though he travelled with a “rabia,” or guarantor, from the A1 Murra y rab ia tribe, the journey was rendered extremely dangerous by the risk of an attack on the Felix, party by Ikkwan fanatics, who roam apparently at large, over the whole area 216 - 7 - 281 Thirdly, the sites of Salwa, Iskak (? = Sakak) and Mabak, the first two of which lie on, Arabia and the third slightly south of, the pre-war boundary of Qatar, were at the time of Pelix - his journey in the hands of the Ikhwan, with the result that he could not visit them, jk 245 ; 892 17. On the question of political conditions Mr. Thomas throughout his journey (the route of which lay well to the east of the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention) from the centre of the Rub-al-Khali northwards to the Persian Gulf refers to the established influence of Ibn Sand and its beneficent results, and remarks: “ To-day peace, the peace of Bin Sand, prevails throughout the sands. The influence of the Ruler of Central Arabia, wielded through his able Viceroy at Hofuf, Ibn Jilnwi, compels peace between all these old enemies, not through direct pp/ 271 - 2 . control, for there is and can be none, hut through the immense personal prestige of Abdul Aziz himself. A belief in his strength and star has swept across the sands. Not love, but awe, serves this wuse providence that so directs affairs. . . . Thus, the sand tribes proper are in some degree leagued with Bin Sand. They pay to him a nominal tribute and by that act are ensured mutual protection one from the other. In theory the tribute is an annual levy of one dollar on each camel. In practice, the Rashid have no money, and in any event they escape proper payment by reason of their remoteness. They do, however, send a camel from year to year as occasion offers in token of submission. When, however, rains fall in the northern sands and they migrate thither, the tax-gatherers’ demands must be met, and a few camels are sold for the purpose. Light as is the bond, the tribes grumble at it. . . . They all swear that the existing peace shall last only as long as the present regime of Riyadh. Let Riyadh or Hofuf be thought to have lost its power, and raiding will he resumed immediately, and blood will flow again. ...” Mr. Thomas’s remarks may be compared with those of Mr. Philby (who in 1932 travelled through the Barr-al-Qarah area and thence south-west to the Jabrin oasis) reproduced in section III of the Appendix to this Note.The Barr-al-Qarah District. 18. The importance of this district for the present purpose is first that it embraces the coastal strip lying between the blue line and the pre-war western extremity of Qatar, and secondly that it appears to correspond fairly closely* if not exactly, with the triangle of land lying to the east of the blue line, which falls within the area left to the west of the rough line indicted to Ibn Sand and Major Holmes by Sir P. Coi in 1922 (see paragraph 6 above). Mr. Philby, with the assistance of recommendations and guides furnished by Ibn Jiluwi, the Saudi Governor^of Hasa, travelled through a portion of it in 1932*. The impression left by his Pmpty Quarter is that the dominant political influence at the present day are the Saudi Government and. the Ikhwan. Details of the Barr-al-Qarah district are given in the extract from Lorimer reproduced as item I (v) in the Appendix to this Dote. As will be seen, Lorimer considered that it “might perhaps be reckoned as included in the Sanjaq of Hasa 5 '— in other words, in the pre-war Ottoman Sandjaq of Nejd. On this assumption the boundaries of Nejd in the 1913 Convention might well have been fixed so as to include it, with the result that the limits of Nejd would have touched the pre-war limits of Qatar on the coastline at the head of Dohai-as-Salwa Bay, the hinterland (actually the Jafurah Desert) being left in indeterminate ownership. For whatever reason (and it must be assumed that substantial justification was produced to persuade the Turks to relinquish their position in the Barr-al-Qarah) the line was in fact fixed farther to the west. But the history of the Barr-al-Qarah, and the fact that the 1913 Convention had never been ratified, may well have been the reasons which led Sir P. Cox in 1922 to fix the limits of Hasa at a point which included in it the Barr-al-Qarah rather than at the blue line of the 1913 Convention. Conclusions. 19. In the light of the examination of the position given above, and subject to the observations of the Government of India and the Political Resident, the best course would appear to be the following :— (a) Boundaries of Qatar .—To agree that the boundaries of Qatar shall be accepted as being on the north, east and west, the sea ; on the south, a line running across the base of the Peninsula from a point not south of the latitude of the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay to a point not south of the north side of the Ivhor-al-Odeid inlet. The line indicated on the I.P.C. map would satisfy these criteria, and if it is confirmed that it is the line at present claimed by the Sheikh of Qatar it could be accepted. A slight modification to bring the line some 12 miles south to the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, and so to reduce the area of sea coast in indeterminate ownership, could be considered if necessary. (b) The blue line of the 1913 Convention, to be maintained as against Ibn Sand, for the reasons given in paragraph 11 above, as the eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia. (c) If a claim is advanced by Ibn Saud to the Barr-al-Qarah on the ground of the line indicated by Sir Percy Cox in the Oqair conversations in 1922, referred to in paragraph 6, that His Majesty’s Government should either— (i) concede the claim, on the ground, if necessary, that they regarded themselves as committed by the informal conversations of 1922, but without prejudice to the maintenance in principle of tho blue line, and in return for a formal recognition by Ibn Saud of the validity of this line. The attribution to Ibn Saud of the Barr-al-Qarah area, undesirable as it may be on other grounds, -would have the advantage of leaving no gap of indeterminate territory bordering on the sea 1 coast, for we can without difficulty, as suggested in (a) above, recognise the frontiers of Qatar as beginning at Dohat-as-Salwa, i.e. at the point at which the Barr-al-Qarah ends. (ii) If it was thought preferable to make no concession in respect of the blue line, then to argue that informal discussions such as those of 1922, which had never been confirmed in writing or been the subject of formal agreement, had no binding effect, and that His Majesty’s Government took their stand on the blue line. Play might be made with the fact that the line drawn by Sir Percy Cox would, in fact, deprive Ibn Saud of a substantial area lying between Djau-al-Dukhan and the western side of the blue line.\d/) The Q')eci lyiTici beticeejx the blue liup nnrl tTm j j as im (a) above to be re»atded suhi'ent t ^ V*’* a, ' ws reeo !?&gt;J 2 se(i for .Qatar no claim to them is made or ’ co 1) he , 1 “'‘‘T b y *e Eesidedt that Dhabi, as of indeterminate ownershio ' As t,a t ted ° f Aqal ^ Abl1 ^ inhospitable desert under Ikhvvau eontml ‘ 1 appears to be largely Barr-al-Qarah, the ^ ^ themselves in it is probably small If iP ^ 6 T 1 ^ ^ ctl vely interest Sand has no interest^ of the blue }Le ^mi^hM^ 6 Pnncif&gt;le that Ibn whether to attribute it to Qatar or Abu Dhabf (the thTig^ for q:s u ’ ?: t *— interests from endeavouring to estahhh a foothold t pre . v , ent . fore [g n way it could best be made dear that we regarded it 1 ’“ nsidel -. “ wba ‘ own sphere of influence or that of one of our Trucial allies mg m our W W^^e^WaiaJiQ^h^tarted in Qatar, togonvey a warning through / to the migratory Bedouin tribes who ut the^SS^STZT- the event of their crossing, with hostile intent or save for norma peacehil pursuits such as grazing, such line as may be fixed as the boundary of Qatai, .they will do s^o at their own peril.

'O- India Office, * T n 26th January 1934. J ' G ' Lai ™ wai ™ ; APPENDIX. Boundaries of Qatar. I —Exiracts from Lorimer’s Gazetteer. - (i) Qatar. [N.B. —Mr. Lorimer’s article on Qatar is stated to be the result of special enquiries made over a number of years locally.) Lorimer, Vol. II, page 1506, defines the boundaries of Qatar as follows :— “ On the east, north and west, Qatar is surrounded by the sea. The southern boundary is somewhat indeterminate. It begins at the foot of Dohat-as-Sahva on the western side of the promontory, and from that point runs south-eastwards to the wells of Sakak. Thence, according to one account, it strikes east-north east to the north end of the Naqiyan sandhills, or, according to another, east by south to the southern end of the same hi Us on the north side of the entrance to Khor-al-Odaid. As the territory of the Trucial Sheikh of Abu Dhabi has never clearly been asserted to extend beyond Khor-al-Odaid, and as the Al-Tbani Sheikhs of Qatar undoubtedly claim the Naqiyan tract, the latter of the two alternative lines is to be preferred ; the British Government have recognised Khor-al-Odaid as belonging to Abu Dhabi and the boundary consequently cannot be placed nearer to Trucial Oman, though the Al-Thani Sheikhs assert a right to the whole coast as far as the Sabakhat Matti. It is said that three men stationed at Dohat-as-Salwa, Sakak and Niqa-al-Maharak, respectively, can watch the whole southern border of Qatar from sea to sea.”8 (ii) Khor-al-Odaid. In Vol. II, on page 1367, Mr. Lorimer describes Khor-al-Odaid as “ an inlet or creek on the coast of the Abu Dhabi principality as its extreme western end. It lies about 180 miles almost due west from the town of Abu Dhabi. The boundary of Qatar is either at, or a short distance to, the north of the inlet. (iii) Aqal. In Vol. II, pages 88-89, Mr. Lorimer describes Aqal as “a small littoral district at the base of'the Qatar peninsula upon the east side ; it is bounded by Khor-al-Odaid on the north-west and by Dohat-an-Nakholah on the south-east, the distance between which in a direct line is nearly 35 miles. Inland the depth of the district is on an average about 20 miles.” [N.B.—Nathal (Sandah) in Aqal is 20 to 25 miles inland, westward, from the foot of Khor-al-Odaid.] “ On the landward side Aqal is enclosed by Mijan on the east, the Jafurah desert on the south and south-west, and by Qatar on the north-west. . . . The Bedouins do not regard Aqal as geographically included in Oman, which in their view is terminated on the west by the Sabakhat Matti; but the district has been recognised by the British Government as forming part of the territories of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and must therefore be considered to belong, in the political sense, to Trucial Oman.” (iv) Aim Dhabi In Vol. II, page 405, under “ Ahu Dhabi,” Mr. Lorimer remarks: “Along the coast Abu Dhabi reaches from ... to Khor-al-Odaid on the west, a distance of over 200 miles. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in 1895 claimed that his frontier extended to the Bay of Omm-al-Hul, near VVakrah in Qatar, but his claim was not approved by the Government of India ; Bishairiyah has also been named as the limit of his State in this direction, but no good reason has been adduced for supposing that his jurisdiction ever extended beyond Khor-al-Odaid, though the northern shore of that inlet should perhaps be reckoned as included with the inlet itself in his territories. Inland the frontiers of Abu Dhabi are not defined. It is asserted that on the east they reach to the Bareimi oasis, but without taking it in, and on the south they may presumably be placed at the margin of the Ruba-al-Khali.” (v) Barr-al-Qarah. Lorimer, II, 1AS2. “A coastal tract in East Arabia which may perhaps be reckoned as included in the Sanjaq of Ilasa [itself, for the purposes of the Anglo- Turkish Convention of 1913, included in the Ottoman Sandjak of Nejd]. It reaches from Ras-as-Sufairah on the north to the bottom of Dohat-as-Salwa on the south, a distance of about 36 miles ; and inland it extends to a depth of about 12 miles. Upon the coast it meets Barr-al-Oqair to the north and Qatar to the south of it; and inland, in all directions, it merges in the Jafurah desert. Some authorities would even make Barr-al-Qarah a part of Jafurah. ...” (vi) Jafurah. Lorimer, II, 892, describes the Jafurah desert as extending the whole way “ from the Hasa Oasis to the confines of Trucial Oman. ... In shape it is roughly triangular, with its apex on the north almost touching a line drawn between tiofuf and Oqair port and its other corners (to the south-west and south-east) adjoining the Oasis of Jabrin and the southern extremity of Sabakhat Matti respectively. . . . On the east it is separated from the sea ” from north to south “ by Barr-al-Qarah, Qatar, Aqal and Mijan ; on the south it is bounded by the Ruba-al Khali. It may be added here that Jafurah encloses Jabrin upon the north and east and that in the opinion of some Barr-al-Qarah is a portion of Jafurah desert and not a separate tract. “ Jafurah differs from the waterless Ruba-al-Khali only in possessing a few wells of very bitter water and a little scanty grazing; its surface consists of red and burning sand. The Ajman venture into the northern extremity of Jafurah, but the only tribe who frequent it to any considerable extent are the hardy Almorrah and even they avoid entering it unless in winter or in search of a refuge from powerful enemies. . . .

Mr Philby in his crossing of the Ruba-al-Khali in 1932 passed through the barr-al-Qarah coastal belt with the assistance of Ibn Jiluwi and the Hasa authorities turning south-west at Salwa and proceeding thence to the Jabrin Oasis. The following extract from his book “ The Empty Quarter ” is of interest, and supplements the evidence of Mr. Bertram Thomas as recorded in paragraphs 16-18 of the Note p. 28. “ Ali Jahman . . . rode far ahead gossiping about his experiences on a recent tax collecting expedition to the south-eastern districts along the frontier of Oman. . . . I was interested to hear from him that Ibn Sand’s influence is felt to-day m all the Dhahira country, as they call the tract westward of the Oman Massif, including, of course, Buraimi, a Wahhabi centre of long standing, and apparently even Ibri. These tax collecting expeditions scarcely perhaps do more than pay the expenses involved in equipping and sending them out, but they do tend to spread the gospel of Wahhabi peace and Arabian unity. Slowly but surely the ripples of stable government broaden outwards from the centre and the Manasir may be counted to-day as subjects of Ibn Saud, who asks little of them hut the acceptance of his sovereignty and the maintenance of his peace. . . .” (A.B.—The Manasir tribe are concentrated in the Abu Dhabi area, ranging from Qatar to the Baraimi Oasis.; °SEGmT.

The question for settlement is that of t2 ie boundaries Oj. the Sheikhdom or Q,atar where it is not bounded by the sea. In the pre-war period |he sea was regarded as the boundary of the Sheikhdom to the east, north and west.B ^ne boundary to the south was to some extent indeterminate, but broadly speaking was regarded at the time of the compilation of Lorimer f s Gazetteer in 1905-1S07 as running across the base of the Qatar Peninsula more or less south east from Lohat-as-Salwa to a point north of Khor-al-Odeid. m^re is reason to believe that the Sheikh of Qatar still regards it as following approximately this line (see para.8 ^ below) but conditions have not been propitious for raising one question specifically with him and the present note aims at reaching a provisional conclusion on the material .available as to (a) the southern boundary of Qatar; (b) if the boundaries of Qatar on the south and west do not extend to the blue line agreed as the eastern frontier of Rejd in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 1915, the position of the intervening area. The history of the question is as follows. 2. The Boundary on the South-East . To the east, the boundary between Qatar and the adjoining Trucial Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi has been the subject of frequent dispute in the past. The Sheikh of tT 33 m-, m- ior.ii I. ' ■ :,ii. 88-89. or.ii.89 2. Abu Dhabi has claimed sovereignty over a stretch of Qatar territory running so far north as the Bay of Umm-al-Hul, south of VTakra on the map attached. The Sheikh of Qatar, x0r nis F art ) h as claimed sovereignty over areas in the Abu Dhabi Sheikhdom running as far east as the Sabakhat Matti. H.m.G. have consistently refused to recognise claims so exaggerated by either party, but they have repeatedly intimate that they regard the Khor-al-Odeid, which lies about midway between the extreme points referred to, as appertaining to Abu Dhabi* They have also recognised the ifDu Dhabi claim uo the district oi A gal, geographical details of which are given in 1(3) ox the Appendix to this note, and which contains both the Khor-al-Odeid and the Khor-adh-Dhuwaibin. be have thus a fixed point for the south-eastern boundary of Q.atar. 3. The Boundary on the South-West . On the south-western extremity of the Qatar boundary there has been no corresponding dispute, nor is there a fixed point equally definitely established which can with confidence be regarded as marking the western limit of the territories of Qatar. 4 The position prior to the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 * The southern boundary of Qatar was closely investigated locally between 1904 and 1907 by experienced political officers in connection with the compilation of Mr* Lorimer 1 s Persian Gulf Gazatteer. The result of their investigation is given in the extract from the Gasatteer reproduced as item I(i) in the Appendix to this note. Broadly speaking, it Y/ent to show that the southern boundary of the State ran south-east from Dohat-as-Salwa to a point to/f .2.299/34 vras at once the eastern frontier of Hejd and the western frenti A • ^juo ohere are definite objections to adopting this view. In the first place, there is nothing to slicw tna ' t this was in fact the intention of H.M.G. at the time when the Convention was concluded, or that tney nad any object beyond limiting the eastern boundary of tne Tuxkioh possessions in this area. Secondly, there is no evidence or any claim to suzerainty by Q,atar so far to the west or so far to the south. Thirdly, the Resident’s ouregini' 0x ^ amar y 1934, 1.19, emphasises the absence or control by the Sheikh of Q.atar over the interior of his S uatc; ( and a_ _ur - i o ..’i over regions so remote from ho hah ctS C5 ‘ I * C: 110v ' v hnuer consideration) • Fourthly (though this oe ioself is probably not ox serious importance) the position vis-a-vis Ibn Saud is to some extent compromised, as explained below, at any rate as regards the Barr-al-Qarah, by the line fixed by Sir Percy Cox in 1922, Fifthly, it is arguable that even in a formal document such as the 1913 Convention, the fact that the blue line is spoken of as separating Nejd from the Q,atar Peninsula, need not be regarded as determining the boundary of Qatar. The Qatar Peninsula was the closest prominent geographical feature and the nearest adjoining Arab political entity on the mainland and a reference to it for descriptive purposes was not unnatural. Finally, there is much to be said for giving no avoidable extensions to the. boundaries of Qatar even if the consequence is that we have to deal with an of indeterminate ownership between those boundaries even if the conse area of inde term! ana. the blue line6.180/34 lUdj CO .'t ed in IQS*' 5 'hir C?-; v T&gt; r\ iETor Holmov +T~‘::^ r Sir P,Cox to Ibn Saud and in respect of U&amp;oaT .— oil any o il concession One more incident of importance should be recorded before coming to the latest evidence as to the view held by the Sheikh of Qatar as to his southern boundary. The incident is that reported in Colonel Dickson's letter of 4th July 1933, Mo.143, to the Political Hesident, copies of which were received under the Political Resident's express letter of 18th December, 1933, Ho.1934 S; when Sir Percy Co^, m a discussion at Oqair in 1922 with Ibn Saud, then Sultan of Nejd, and Major Holmes, y/arned both the Sultan and Major Holmes that the Sultan could grant no concession and Major Holmes receive none from him in respect of the Principality of Qatar, and drew on a map a line running from Bjau-ed-Huhhan to Hohat-as-Salwa which, he indicated, must represent the eastern boundary of any concession granted by Ibn Saud in respect of Hasa. Such a line, as will be seen from the map, excludes tie whole Qatar Peninsula (and incidentally a substantial area lying to the west of the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention) • It also includes in Hasa an area to the east of the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention, It should, however, be noted that while it constituted a definite indication of the High Commissioner’s view as to %he eastern boundary of Hasa, it in no way specifically defined the boundaries of Qatar save in so far as Qatar might be regarded as marching with Hasa and Nejd, or might be regarded as having been granted a western frontier bounded by the blue line of the 1913 Convention at the time when that Contention was concluded. I Iv * ''V uslii^e etter 947-S 20th Dec. fc22. &gt; 3o. 7.

It would equally give a very substantial extension to one boundaries 01 Qatar - an extension of much more practical importance now than in 1922, when there was no question of active exploitation of the hinterland and our concern was chiefly to maintain the independence of the Sheikhdoms of the Arab littoral against Ibn Saud. The statement is no doubt an alternative version of Sir P. Cox’s warning to Ibn Saud as to the eastern boundary of any concession to be granted by him in respect of Hasa discussed in the preceding paragraph of which an authoritative record based on personal knowledge is given in Colonel Dickson’s letter of 4th July, 1933, a D o•143• 8. I.P.C. map of February - March 1933 . The map compiled by the I.P.C. geologists during their survey in Qatar in February-March 1933, marks a southern boundary line starting on the sea-coast immediately south of Jabul-el-Naksh about 10 miles north of Salwa town and 12 miles north of the head of Dohat-as- Salwa/ &gt;Salwa Bay, turning abruptly to the south-south-east immeaiatoly south-east of Jabul-ol-Hahsh for a distance oi some IB miles to Q,alat-ali-Bin-Said, and thence running due east leaving luair-al-Kamir on its left, through the viaai-al-Gnurban to the sea, which it apparently reaches at a point some 8 miles north of the outlet of the Knor-al-Oaeid inlet and not very far into the Hiqayan Sandhills. dne A.I.O.C., in conmiuni eating a copy 0 f this map i e mar me d: !f lhe dotted line boundary to the south of. ^ a ^ ai apparently the Sheikh’s version of the line. Inm- u.I-.C. report, however, is not definite about this. 11 The A.u.O.C. have since reported that according to (haji A.i’. t-i/io.1 iamson) of tne Geological party wnich visited Qatar in February and March 1933, the Southern boundary shown on their map was indicated by the Sheika himself. If the line in fact represents his view the boundary, as will be seen, will correspond very closely to the pre-War line recorded by Lorimer. 9• Conclusions as to the Southern boundar.y of Q,atar . lu is suggested, in the light of the evidence collected above; (a) that the south-eastern boundary of Q.wt&amp;r must lie to the north of the Khor-al-Odeid and the district of Aqal. (b) that while H.M.G-. had at no stage formally recognised any specific southern boundary to Qatar (save to the extent referred to in (a)) such evidence as is available goes to show that the pre-War boundary ran roughly south-east/south-east across the base ox the Peninsula, from Dohat-as-Salwa or a point slightly north ox it, to a point north of the Khor-al-Odeid. There is no recorded evidence oi any more extensive clairas by the Sheikh of ^atar other than those to Abu Dhabi territory referred to in para. 2 above. (c) In the light of the above, that, if it proves that tne Sheikh of Qatar now regards the line shown on the I.P.C map as nis southern boundary, this may be accepted by H.Iu.G. as generally satisfactory. Acceptance of that line, 11 we continue to regard the blue line of the 1913 Convention as the eastern boundary of the ibn Saud T s territories, (or even if we were to agree to the attribution of the Barr-al-Qarah district lying east of the; blue aine to Hasa (see para. 18 below)) will admittedly leave an area of undetermined ownership between Qatar and ilejd. Tne problems involved in this are discussed in gieater aetaii in paras. 10 and following. If, however, ii.M.G. are prepared to face them, the boundary in question has the merits that it is consistent with the obligations we have undertaken xo Abu Dhabi* it is equally consistent with the maintenance of the blue line of the 1913 Conventic as against Ibn Saud (or with such a modification of that line as is referred to in para. 19(c)(i) below; and it has the advantage of definitely limiting the area of any commitments in respect of protection, etc., into which H.M.G. may think it desirable to enter in the event of an oil concession being granted by the Sheikh. 10. Position of area lying between base of Qatar Peninsula and blue line of Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. If, in these circumstances, it is accepted that the southern/southern ’boundary of Qatar should he a line running via, or ho the north of Sakak more or less south-east from Dohat- as-Sal'.m or a point slightly to the north of Dohat~as~Salvm to a point to the north of the Khor-al-Odeid, the difficult question arises of the position of the country lying between such a line and the blue line of the xUiylo-Turkish Convention of 1913. 11 .- Importance of maintaining the blue line . On the one hand it appears definitely important if possible to maintain the blue line laid down in the unratified hnglo- Turkish Convention of 1913 as against Ion Sand or any other future ruler of this part of hrabia. While the f913 Convention was never ratified, the blue line at any rate represents the agreement reached at the time between Turkey and H.M.G* as uo the limits of Turkish authority in northern i^rabia snd on the Persian Gulf, and in dealing with Ibn Saud as the successor in title to the Turks we can it would seem not unreasonably take our stand on it. The difficulties of finding any satisfactory substitute are patents The undesirability of giving Ion Saud, in the absence of any definite eastern boundary to uis territories, an excuse for territorial expansion (as distinct from the exercise as at present of an informal influence and the receipt from our ^ab clients of payments which we do not recognise and the existence of which we ignore) in the hinterland of the fractal Coast and of Muscat is equally clear. Sucn expansion would clearly involve a risk either of his coming into conflict with the local rulers, whose treaty relations with H.M.G. he has formally recognised, or of his establishing an influence in the Sheikhdoms in question so powerful as to be embarrassing from our point of view. It is relevant, finally,/ IT — finally, confidential information suggests that Ibn Saud does not himself at the moment seriously question the blue line. 12. Disadvantages of maintenance of the blue line v^hile fixing S« boundary of Qatar at the base of the Qatar Peninsula. jJu the same time, important on general grounds, for the reasons given, as the maintenance of the blue line appears to be, the fact must be faced that in the present case if vte continue to regard it as the eastern boundary of Ibn Saud T s territory and if, as suggested, vjg accept a southern boundary for Qatar running roughly across the base of the Qatar Peninsula, a not inconsiderable area lying between the two States, and peopled by migratory Bedouin tribes, will be left in on indeterminate political position. There is a possibility that the Shaikh of ^bu Dhabi, who has in the past exercised a wide influence, and made tribal alliances of his own, in the Trucial hinterland - cf. Sir P. Cox’s letter Do. 176 of 28th June 1904 - might prefer some claim to such an area. But, though on this point further information will be sought from the Resident, there seems little evidence of any active interest on the part of Ibu Dhabi in any area to the west of hqal. assuming that no such claim exists, or could be substantiated the alternatives are to recognise the area as belonging to Ibn Saud; to recognise it as belonging to the Sneikh of Qatar; or to regard it as a political no—man’s land. 13. If we recognised it as belonging to Ibn Saud we could, if necessary, call upon him to keep Bedouin raids into Qatar from it under control. But such recognition would not merely be inconsistent with the maintenance of the blue line of the 1913&gt; Convention to the abandonment of which as stated above the objections appear to be strong, but would represent a formal acceptance of Saudi sovereignty to the borders of Qatar and jfbu Dhabi which might well prove embarrassing,2(t3 11. 14. II, on the* other hani, it is attributed to the Sn&lt; iikh of hatar , we should be justified in eauecting the full cc-operaticn of the Sheikh in denling with Bedouin activities within its limits. But such an rttributicn would not merely give to Qatar a substantial area which she does not in the past appear to have claimed, but would extend the limits of any liability for protection which we may undertake in connection with the grant of an c.il concession. It might be necessary to claim the area (or at any rate its coastal strip) for Qatar if there wore serious signs of foreign interest in it, or of an intention cn the part of I bn Saab to occupy it. But pending such developments it seems wiser to limit cur commitments and to avoid any extension of the area recognised by us as Qatar. 15. The decision to regard it as a political no-man 1 s land would, sc far as can be judged, be likely to mean little more than the acceptance of the de. facto position to-day. will be seen from paragraphs 16 to 18 below, the area, save for the Barr-al-Qarah district, is largely desert, peopled by nomadic tribes, yielding uncertain allegiance to Ibn Sauu, ana it appears to differ little in general conditions from the Rub—al—Khali further south. j_ul-.ittelly the absence o±. a limitrophe ruler who could be made responsible, for the activities of his subjects, may make it more difiicult to secure the southern border of Qatar against nomadic Bedouins. But the difficulties involved may be less than they appear. !i:,e difficulties of any alternative to regarding the tract as of indeterminate ownership are grecot and at any rate as a provisional policy there would appear to be much to be said for treating this area as indctormina.te in owner snip and avoiding if possible raising the thorny questions of its boundaries to the west and of political control within it with Ibn Saul. I HII 12 . % 2— .1 0 -LIAi£Qil Q^Q^ciitions ol’ the ini etemiinate area Bex ore reaching a conclusion it may be well to place on recoid such scanty information as is available about tne nature and the political conditions of the indeterminate area. Apart from the coastal district known as the Barr-al-Garah, which is further discussed in para. 18 below, the bulk of it appears to belong to the Jafurah •uebo-i fc, vuiich Lornner describes as an area '’possessing only a few wells of very bitter water, a little scanty or,ii,892-3 grazing, with a surface of red and burning sand”, in which living conditions are extremely difficult and which is frequented ”to any considerable extent” only by ’’the hardy A1 Morrah, and even they avoid entering it unless in winter or in search of a refuge from more powerful enemies.” Since the date of Lorimer’s Gazatteer Mr. Bertram Thomas, on his recent crossing of the Bub-al-Khali, has passed through this area from south to north, travelling from the well of Banaiyan near Lat. 23° 11’40” via Haluwain, Nakhala, and the western extremity of a salt lake lying immediately west of the IChor-al-Odeid, across the pre-War Qatar frontier to Do hah. His account is of importance because it makes it clear that such local control as is exercised is exercised solely by nomad Bedouin tribes (and principally the A1 Murra, who are a tribe dwelling in the sands, whose influence extends well down into the Rub-al-Khali). Secondly, even though he travelled with a ”rabla”, or guarantor, from the Al Murra tribe, the journey rabia Felix was rendered extremely dangerous by the risk of an attack 216-7 281 on the party by Ikhwan fanatics, who roam apparently at large over tin whole area. Thirdly, the sites of Salwa, Iskak (? = Sakak) and Mabak, the first tv/o of which lie on/rabia Felix p,245 footnote. rabia Felix ip,£71-2 13 . icf oil, ciiiv. blie till I'd slighnly south ox, the pre~¥ar boundary ox Q,atar, were at the time of his journey in the hands of the Ihij.v'van, witn the result that he couldnot visit them. 17. On the question of political conditions Mr. Thomas tin oughouc nis journey (xhe route of which lay well to the east of one blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention) from the centre of the Eub-al-Khali northwards to the Persian Gulf refers to the established influence of Ibn Saud ana its beneficent results, and remarks; TI To-day peace, the peace of Bin Saud, prevails throughout the sands. The inluence of the Euler of Central Arabia, wielded through his able Viceroy at Hofuf, Ibn Jiluwi, compels peace between all these old enemies, not through direct control, for there is and can be none, but through the immense personal prestige of Abdul Asia himself. A belief in his strength and star has swept across the sands. Not love, but awe, serves this wise providence that so directs affairs .... Thus the sand tribes proper are in some degree leagued with Bin Saud. They pay to him a nominal tribute and by that act are ensured mutual protection one from the other. In theory the tribute is an annual levy of one dollar on each camel. In practice, the Eashid have no money, and in any event they escape proper payment by reason of their remoteness. They cio, however, send a camel from year to year as occasion offers in token of submission. When, however, rains fall in bhe norAxern sands and they migrate thither, the tax-gatherers* demands must be met, and a few camels are sold for the puxpose. Light as isthe bond, the tribes grumble at it .... They all swear that the existing peace shall last only as long as the present regime of Hiyadh. Lex Itiyacui or Ho-iuf be thought/thought to have lost its power, and raiding will he resumed immediately, and blood will flow again .. .. ,r Mr„ Thomas 1 s remarks may he compared with those of Mr.Philby who in l-w^ braveliea through the Barr-al-Garah area and thence souoh-west to the Jabrin oasis which are reproduced in Section III of the Appendix: to this note. 18 • The Barr-al-garah dis trict. The importance of this district for the present purpose is first that it embraces the coastal strip lying he tween the blue line and the pre-War western extremity of Qatar, and secondly that it appears to correspond fairly .closely, if not exactly, with the triangle of land lying to the east of the blue line, which falls within the area left /(rw vP to the west of the rough line indicated to-Mr, gaud: and Major Holmes by Sir P. Cox in 1922 (see para. 6 above). Mr. Philhy, with the assistance of recommendations and guides furnished by Ibn Jiluwi, the Saudi Governor of Hasa, travelled through a portion of it in 1932. The impression left by his 'Empty Quarter' is that the dominant political influence at the present day are the Saudi Government and the Ihhwan. Details of the Barr-al -Qarah district are given in the extract from Lorimer reproduced as item I (5) in the Appendix to this Hote. As will be seen, Lorimer considered that it 'might perhaps be reckoned as included in uhe Sanjacg of Has a” - in other words, in the pre-War Ottoman Sandjaqof Hejd. On this assumption the boundaries of Hejd in the 1913 Convention might well have been fixed so as to include it, with the result that the limits of Hejd would have touched the pre-War limits of Qatar on the coastline at thea s ' m 3*7 head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, the hinterland (actually the Jafurah Desert) 'being left in indeterminate ownership. For whatever reason (and it must he assumed that substantial justification was produced to persuade the Turks to relinquish their position in the Barr-al-Qarah) the line was in fact fixed farther to the west. But the history of the Barr-al-Qurah, and the fact that the 1913 Convention had never been ratified, may well have been the reasons which led Sir P. Cox in 192S to fix the limits of Hasa at a point which included in it the Barr-ai-warah rather than at the blue line of the 1913 Convention. 19. Conclusions. In the light of the examination of the position given above, and subject to the observations of the Government of India and the Political Hesident, the best course would appear to be the following:- (a) Boundaries of Gatar . To agree that the boundaries of Qatar shall be accepted as being on the north, east and west, the sea; on the south, a line running across the base of the it iUJJM 'J lu L- J O' Peninsula from a point not south of^Dohat-as-Salwa Bay to a point not south of the north side of the Khor-al-Qdeid inlet. The line indicated on the I.P.C.map would satisfy these criteria and if it is confirmed that it is the line at present claimed by the Sheikh of Qatar it could be accepted. A slight modification to bring the line some 12 miles south to the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, and so to reduce the area ox sea coast in indeterminate ownership , could be considered if necessary. (p) The blue line of the 1913 Convention ,to be maintained as against Ibn Saud for the reasons given in paragraph 11 above, as the eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia. (c)/(c) a claim is advanced by I bn Saud to the Barr-al- .^arah on the ground or the line indicated by Sir Percy Cox in ^the Oqair conversations in 1922 referred to in paragraph 6, that should either (i) concede rhe claim, on the ground if necessary that they regarded themselves as committed by the informal conversations of 1922, but without prejudice to the mainlenance in principle of tne blue line, and in return for a formal recognition by I bn Saud of the validity of this line. fhe attribution to Ibn Saud Gi- u_ic; Barr-al- arah area, undersirable as it may be on other grounds, would have the advantage of leaving no gap of indeterminate territory bordering on the sea coast, for we can without difficulty, as suggested in (a) above recognise the frontiers of gatar as beginning at Bohat-as-Salwa, i.e. at the point at which the Barr-al--Parah ends. (ii) If it v/as thought preferable to make no concession in respect of the blue line, then to argue that informal discussions such as those of 1922, which had never been confirmed in writing or been the subject of formal agreement had no binding effect and that E.M.G. took their stand on the blue line. Play might be made with the fact that the line draY/n by Sir Percy Cox would in fact deprive Ibn Saud of a substantial area lying between Djau-al-Dubhan and the western side of the blue line (d) ‘I'he area lying between the blue line and the boundaries recognised for Qatar as in (a) above to be regarded, subject to confirmation by the Resident that no claim to themis made or could be substantiated west of Aqal by Abu Dhabi, as of indeterminate ownership; As it appears to be largely inhospitable desert under Ikhwan control, save for the coastal strip of the Barr-al-^arah, the probability that oil companies will/17 . &gt; will acuively interest themselves in it is probably small. If they do, on the principle that Ibn Saud has no interest east oi uae olue line, it miglit be necessary to consider whetner to attribute it to Qatar or Abu Dhabi, (the wording of the 1913 Convention, as quoted in paragraph 5 above, would assist us in claiming it for Qatar). it would in any event ke uesixaDle, in order to prevent foreign interests from endeavouring oo establish a foothold in it, to consider in what way it could best oe made clear that we regarded it as iailing v/i uliin our own sphere of influence, or that of one of our Trucial a lues. , ^ A (e) A Once oil operations^ start} in ,-^atar to convey a warning unrougn tne blieildi of Qatar to the migratory Bedouin trioes who use the area referred to in (d) that in the event of tneir crossing, with hostile intent or save for normal peaceful pursuits, such as grazing, such line as may be i ixeci us tne oounctary of Qatar, they will do so at their own peril. The local political authorities would no doubt be able to ascertain and to advise what customary rights in respect of grazing, etc. these migratory tribes at present enjoy within gatar proper. On the question whether any corresponding intimation should be made to Ibn baud in respect of tribes permanently belonging to He id but using the indeterminate area os—, it seems definitely preferable in the interest of avoiding discussion with him of the position of the indeterminate area and of the blue line to make no communication unless and until circumstances mane tins quite inevitable. h*\ tJln n*, A Aw*^**} ^ ff*&amp;A*t* -r ■ - J.G-.Lhl fii \iAL TE.

B i-r .Lorimer ’ s article on Q,atar is stated to be the result ox special enquiries made over a number of years locally.) Lorimer Vol.ii, p.1506, defines the boundaries of Qatar as follows:- 15 On the east, north and west, Qatar is surrounded by the sea,. The southern boundary is scmewhat indeterminate. It begins at the foot of Dbhat-as-Salwa on the western side of the pranontory, and from that point runs south-eastwards to the wells of Sakak. Thence, according to one account, it strikes east-north-east to the north end of the ITaqiyan sandhills, or according to another east by south to the southern end of the same hills on the north side of the entrance to Khor-al-Odaid. As the territory of the Trucial Sheikh of Abu Dhabi has never clearly been asserted to extend beyond Khor-al-Odaid , and as the Al-Thani Sheikhs of Qatar undoubtedly claim the ITaqiyan tract, the latter of the two alternative lines is to be preferred; the British Government have recognised Khor-al-Odaid as belonging to Abu Dhabi and the boundary consequently cannot be placed nearer to Trucial Oman, though the Al-Thani Sheikhs assert a right to the whole coast as far as the Sabakhat Matti. It is said that three men stationed at D ohat-as-Salwa , Sakak and E i qa-al -Maharah respectively, can watch the whole southern border of Qatar from sea to sea” . Khor-al-Odaid. I (2) In Vol.ii, on page 1567 , Mr.Lorimer describes Khor-al-Odaid as 'an inlet or creek on the coast of the Abu Dhabi principality at its extreme western end. It lies about 180 miles almost due west fran the town of Abu Dhabi. The2 . boundary of Qatar is either at* or a short distance to, the north of the inlet'. i-iQal.» (3) In V ol.ii, pp. 88-89 . Mr.Lorimer describes Agal as 'a small littoral district at the base of the Qatar peninsula upon the East side; it is bounded by Khcr-al- Odaid on the M.W. and by Dohat-an-hakholah on the S.E. , the distance between which in a direct line is nearly 35 miles. Inland the depth of the district is on an average about 20 miles'. /'h .E. Hathal (Sandah) in Aqal is 20 to 25 miles inland, westward, from the foot of Khor-al- Odaid'' 7 . On the landward side Aqal is enclosed by Mijan on the East, the Jafurah desert on the South and South- West, and by Qatar on the ITorth-West The Bedouins do not regard Aqal as geographically included in Oman which in their view is terminated on the West by the Sabakhat Matti; but the district has been recognised by the British Government as forming part of the territories of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and must therefore be considered to belong, in the political sense, to Trucial Oman.' Abu Dhabi . (4) In Vol.ii, page 405 , under ' Ab u Dhab i' , Mr.Lorimer remarks: 'along the coast Abu Dhabi reaches frcm to Khor-al-Odaid on the west, a distance of over 200 miles. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in 1895 claimed that his frontier extended to the Bay of TJmm-al-Hul, near Wakrah in Qatar, but his claim was not approved by the Government of India: Bishairiyah has also oeen named as the limit of his State in this direction, but no goodreason has been abduced for supposing that his jurisdiction ever extended beyond Khor-al-Odaid # though the northern shore of that inlet should perhaps be reckoned as included with the inlet itself in his territories. Inland the frontiers of Abu Dhabi are not defined. It is asserted that on the east they reach to the Bareimi oasis, but without taking it in, and on the south they may presumably be placed at the margin of the Hub a-al-Khali'. B ar r - al - Q,ar ah. (5) Lorimer ii. 1482. 'A coastal tract in East Arabia which may perhaps be reckoned as included in the San j aq of Hasa, /Ttself, for the purposes of the Anglo- Turkish Convention of 1913, included in the Ottcman Sandj ak of He.id”V. It reaches from Ras-as-Sufairah on the North to the bottom of Dohat-as-Saiwa on the South, a distance of about 36 miles; and inland it extends to a depth of about 12 miles . Upon the coast it meets Barr-al-Oqair to the north, and Qatar to the South of it; and inland, in all directions, it merges in the Jafurah desert. Sane authorities would even make Barr-al-Qarah a part of Jafurah Jafurah. (6) Lorimer ii. 892 , describes the Jafurah Desert as extending the whole way 'fran the Hasa Oasis to the confines of Trucial Oman.... In shape it is roughly triangular with its apex on the north almost touching a line drawn between Hofuf and Oqair port and its other corners (to the south-west and south-east) adjoining the Oasis of Jabrin, and the southern extremity of Sabakhat . M■fatti respectively On the east it is separated from the sea' from north to south 'by Sarr-al-Q.arah, Qatar, Aqal and Mijan; on the south it is bounded by the Ruba.-al-Khali. It may be added here that Jafurah encloses Jabrin upon the north and east and that in the opinion of some Barr-al-Qarah is a portion of Jafurah desert and not a separate tract. Jafurah differs from the waterless Ruba-al-Khali only in possessing a few wells of very bitter water and a little scanty grazing; its surface consists of red and burning sand. The Ajman venture into the northern extremity of Jafurah but the only tribe who frequent it to any considerable extent are the hardy Almorrah and even they avoid entering it unless in winter or in search of a refuge from powerful enemies While sojourning in Jafurah the Almorrah as a rule drink nothing but the milk of their camels and even cook their rice in the same; if compelled to swallow water from the wells they first mix it with dried dates to make it more palatable. The Wahabis have frequently v/aged war upon the Almorrah, but Faisal alone, if local tradition is to be believed, succeeded in penetrating with his troops as far as Banaiyan, and his force was so reduced by the hardships of the march that he was compelled on his arrival there to grant the tribe exceedingly easy terns.'

The I.P.C. report, however, is not definite about this.Maps and Sections. The sketch map on Plate I is based on the outline given in the War Office Map of Asia on 1:1,000,000 scale, with alterations and additions controlled by %£he traverses made during this survey. The coastline from Odaid northwards to Has Rakan and thence west and south to Fahahil (near Zubara), as shown on the War Office map, agreed tolerably well with our traverses except in the neighbourhood of Dha ! ain and Khor al Mohander. South of Fahahil as far as Dohat al Hussain our observations diverged to some extent from the outline given on the map. Unfortunately, during our visits to the neighbourhood of Dohat Faishakh visibility was poor and we could not get as many control bearings as could be desired. The map on Plate I is, therefore, open to question in this area. The shape of the coastline from Has Abaruk southwards to Salwa has been drawn entirely from our traverses and differs radically from the War Office or any other map we have seen of the peninsula. Positions of inland places are based entirely on our traverses and differ widely from the 1:1,000,000 map.&amp;rm whi&amp;h Bin proposed to to the iastorn k &amp;m9*&gt; ral for their conet^oioB* this aroa included %lm wfele of th# IfiMiitfii province and the -atar j^tilaaula * ,&lt; i T ?»•. ,. ,_ ') the aouth western &amp;&amp;&amp; m&amp;thnm boundary of the conooeaioa hain^ as^rkod on tha ?mp by a line dram Hmm the ati aruq. as far as Jaw &amp;1 Bu^tmn anti then turning feat from there to Khmt M Dhuwalhln on the tea# S # ;.,Xr lorcy C«ss: &gt; wh«» h« oaw how the proposed line was nade to inclmtc atar f draw a rad pencil line frmt Jaw «tl Dukhan to Hohat mim, ( the head of the hay to the couth of Bahrain Xsland.)©nd. ®®til n thivt la the lino*.

I am, Sir, Pour most obedient Servant^ 1 BE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE INDIA OFFICE. 7 II have the honour to slate that in view of the grant of the Hasa Oil Concession to the Standard Oil Company of California and of the negotiations entered into by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited for an Oil Concession in Qatar, the early determination of the boundaries of Qatar is desirable. 2. In Lorimer’s Oasetteer of the Persian Grulf (Volume II page 1506) the Southern boundary is described as commencing at the foot of Dohat as Salwa and proceed ing South Eastwards to the wells of Sakak, Thence two alternatives are mentioned, with a preference for the latter (i) striking East-Horth-East to the Horth end of the Maqiyan hills (ii) East by South to the Southern end of the same hills on the Horth side of the entrance to Khar al f 0daid. 3, On his return from the Ojair Conference at the end of 1922 Sir Percy Cox, High Commissioner for f Iraq, informed the Political Resident in the terms of memorandum Mo.947-3 of 20th December 1922 (copy attached) from the Under Secrrtary to the Political Resident to the Political Agent, Bahrain. This is the only record on my files of the arrangement come to between His Majesty^ Secretary of State for the Colonies, The Colonial Office, L o n d o n .'between Sir Percy Gox and Ibn Saud. 4* I also enclose in this connection a copy of a letter Ho.I # 0»10, dated the 19th January 1923, from the Secretary to His Excellency the High Commissioner for * Iraq to the Secretary to the Covernment of India in the foreign and Political Department. If this line is accepted as the boundary between Saudi Arabia and Qatar it would give the Shaikh of Qatar a wider extent of territory than either of the two boundaries mentioned in Gazetteer. In any case the southern point at which this line terminates and the southern boundary line remain for determination. 5 , Ho further information is available on my records, I am, however, enquiring from the Political Agent, Bahrain, and Colonel Dickson, the Political Agent, Kuwait, (the latter of whom accompanied Sir Percy Cox on his mission to Ojair), whether they can furnish any additional information. I am also asking the Political Agent, Bahrain, to enquire from the Shaikh of Qatar without expressing any opinion on the point what he ^ the Shaikh - considers to be the boundaries of his territory. 6.

Sir, I am directed to reply to foreign Department letter ^ 0 •1267/652-Ext, dated 7th December on the subject of the apparent inclination of His Highness Ibn Sa'ud to absorb the Qatar principality. 2* The High Commissioner had recently spent some days with His Highness (from 37th November to End December) during which the status of Qatar was in evidence in connection with a project, under consideration by Ibn Sa f ud, for the grant of an Oil Concession for a tract of lajd territory. Sir p arcy Cos found that in hie discussion with the Engineer representing the aspirant concessionnaires His Highness had apparently included the Qatar peninsula within the tract of country for which he was prepared to negotiate a concession - Sir Percy Cox at once took him to task, reminding him that he had nothing to do with Qatar except to respect it, under the terms of his treaty with us, and insisting on the limitation of his discussion to country West of the longitude of the head of Salwah Bay. The Sultan accepted this injunction without argument and the High Commissioner accordingly doubts whether a further communication on the subject is necessary or, indeed, advisable after so short an interval. He will be fully prepared however to return to the attack if there should be any fresh evidence of a disposition on the part of the Sultan to encroach upon Qatar. is A copy of this communication being forwardedto the Resident in the Persian Gulf.

The one respect of importance in which the treaty went beyond the normal type of Trucial treaty was that it contained an undertaking that the o-ood offices of His Majesty’s Government should be granted to the Sheikh m the event of unprovoked aggression against him bij land within che territories of Katr (Article XI). The assurance in question did not, however, in practice impose any very serious liability on His Majesty’s Government, as was shown when a tentative appeal was made to it by the Sheikh (see para. 9 of Memorandum on the Trucial Sheikhs, 1908-28, on page 8 The treaty was ratified by the Govern or-General of India hi C om on 28th March 1918. * The history of Katr from the date of i* is dealt with in the Memorandum on the Trucial Chiefs on/page ^ du may be recorded here that the position of its ruler was o n conclusion of the European War by the grant to him oft* 6 ^ • .* ^ rcl Jl 1919) and of a salute of seven guns—honours of wiiicn ne is me oi recipient among the chiefs of the 1 racial Coast.

The French material consists of a short extract from the aforementioned Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913, which is contained in copies of an India Office memorandum on the southern boundary of Qatar.The volume includes two dividers which give a list of correspondence references contained in the volume by year. These are placed at the back of the correspondence (folios 3-4).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to the Republic of Turkey</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Committee of Imperial Defence, Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Qatar</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions</topic></subject><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00029c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
