' J ■n. I enclose for your information a copy of a letter which I have addressed to Caroe on the subject of the future of the Kuria Muria Islands. The Government of India had asked for my views on the questions raised in Walton’s demi- official letter No.P.Z.3388/36 dated 4th June 1936, a copy of which was sent to you. Yours sincerely, Sd. M.C.Lake• The Honourable Li eutenant-Colonel T.C. W.Eowle, C.B.S., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire •CoTrr. ! T o.C/ll57. Of The i*ee idency, Aden, the 18th ^uly 1936. ■-a. T)ear Caroe, Pleane refer to your deni-official letter ITo .^.444-1^/36 of 8^th .Tune 1936 on the euhject of the future of ♦he Kuria Muria Inlandn. S. I a^ree '-hat it is desirable that ■'•he Inlands should cease, with Aden, to he Dart of British India and that this y/ould he automatically effected by the transfer of Men to His Maj esty ’ s Hovernmen 1 0 3. After ceasinp to be pert of British India, there appear to me t o be four alternatives ns regards the future of the Islands :~ (l) 'Hiat their le^al status should continue +o be that of one of the dependencies of the Colony of Aden and that they should also be administered and controlled by Aden. (9) ''’ha 4 - their lee*«l status should be ns above, but that they should remain as at present under Ihe Political Resident in the Persian Cm If for admini strative purposes. ( 3 ) Hiat they should cease to form ug rt of Men but become a British possession attached to the Persian Gulf sphere and be under the jurisdiction and administration of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. ( 4 ) That the Islands should be returned to the Hu it an of Muscat. Provided that there are no imperial or commercial interests involved, I favour the fourth alternative, as, for 82 years since they were ceded to Great Britain, '-here has been practically no contact with -then anc- very little, if any, benefit derived from them. 4* /■■■■■ -2- /* 4. An far as I an arcare, the onlv comercial interest is the fxuano deposit which is reported to be exhausted. And even if this report be untrue, it is unlikely that the collection of yuano from the Islands would be a comnercial proposition of sufficient value to justify the reyften^ ion of the Islands. 5. V/hether Imperial interests are involved or not, it is for His Majestv's Government to decide, bui even should they be, the interests should be eoually secure in the keeping of the Sultan of Muscat. 6. Should either Inneriai or commercial interests he involved to the extent of making it desirable to retain the Islands as a British Possession, I favour the remaining altema Ives in the following order (3), (£),.

It is possible that this would be inconvenient, in that event I propose, subject to your approval, to suggest to the Conmander-in-Chief that 'Challenger' drops me a t Gwadur on her way to Karachi on about 21st December and picks me up again on her return to Masirah to complete the survey. This arrangement would, I think, entail a comparatively small deviation from the direct route.

V I have the honour to refer to your telegram No.400 dated the 8th December, 1938* and to forward herewith a report on my visit to Masirah Island in H.2C.S. Challenger. 2. I embarked at Muscat in 'Challenger” on December 9th which sailed the same day for Ras al Hadd where some deep sea soundings were carried out on 10th December. Masirah Island was reached on 11th December and accompanied by tin Commander Baker I went ashore at Umm Rasas the chief village of the island. The Shaikh was absent on the mainland but Hie men present in the village to the number of some eight persons were assembled and the Sultans letter to the Shaijch, which I had taken with me, read out to them. The object of the Challenger’s visit to the island was explained to the men and they were warned not to interfere with or remove any of the beacons* flag poles etcetra which might be erected on the island for survey purposes. This was readily promised. 3. The attitude of every body met with on the island both at tlmm Rasas and other places was quite friendly, Thxoi^i the kindness of Coamander Baker I let it be known that any sick- 2 - * 5 &gt; siok persons would be given free medical treatment on presenting themselves* Three men came on hoard and were treated, one having a minor operation successfully performed* in _ This act helped considerably/maintaining the friendly rela tions with the islanders during our stay in those waters. 4 , Survey work was carried out in Masirah Channel between 12th and 19th December # parties ianaing each day on 4h various parts of the south west coast of the island. This part of the island is practically uninhabited and the few persons met were, as in other places, friendly. On the 19th 'Challenger* left for India in order to spend Christmas in Karachi. I was disembarked en route at Gwadur, re-imbarking again on 30th December and reaching Muscat on the 1st January 1^39. 'Challenger' sailed the same d ay for Masirah to proceed with the survey. I understand that this work will probably taKe at least another month to complete. 5, I did not accompany 'Challenger' on this occasion as owing to the satisfactory political situation during our visit there in December I did not consider my presence ne cessary. My intention was reported to you from Gwadur vide my telegram No. T-5 dated the 27th December 1938. 6. I had arranged with Commander Baker prior to his \ departure from Muscat that he would signal me if any inci dents occurred and return at once to Muscat to tajce me down there should trouble of any sort be experienced with the ' islanders. As up to the time of writing no report has been received from 'Challenger' it may safely be presumed, I think, that all is well. 7.

Part 2 is a summary of the work done and information gathered thought to he of value under the following headings:- (a) Medical, (b) Political, (c) Meteorology, (d) Vegetation, (e) Geology, (f) Natural History, (g) Anthropology. PART 1. DIARY. 26th January 1959 . I landed at 1200 with Leading ieiegraphist Damon, A.B. Coates, and Hassan, the native interpreter. Camp was pitched 50 yards beyond the high water mark at a spot about 5 miles north of Marses (Uram-Rasas on the Chart) and about 2 miles south of Dawa (Daua or Datti on Chart), 500 yards to the south were two wells (Has Shagaf Wells), one of them silted up with sand, and a hut used as a rest house and called Makan-el~Raha. The three ridge-pole tents were erected in the shape of a 'T' so that an extra fly supported by their poles could form a roomy sun shade. Stores were kept in the Arctic tent. As the camp was being erected a native arrived by canoe from Dawa and offered fresh 'water. In the afternoon a shark merchant from Dawa called named Abdulla bin Tbabet. He asked if we knew Major Watts (Political Agent), but 'was otherwise uncommunicative. In the evening a fisher boy passing by was induced to come to the camp. He was frightened to say much about the Shaikh but obviously hated him saying that his mother and father were killed about 7 years previously by order of the Shaikh. 24 hour tide readings were commenced. Several figures 'were seen in the distance on the plain, but they did not approach the camp. 27th January . About 0200 a dhow was seen close inshore approaching the camp, but made off when the Aldis lamp was directed on it. In the forenoon accompanied by Hassan, I went to Dawa, about 40 minutes walk. As we approached we could see 'women and children running away and hear shouts of tt Farangie cagie' ('Europeans coming'). We managed to collect a few natives, and through the interpreter I told them that I had come to treat the sick and wished to see the head man. Some said he was in another village, others that he was out in a dhow. After answering many Questions, it was conceded that he really was in the village, and he was sent for.27th Januar/ 1959. (continued). The natives were timid at first, the women hiding in their houses, hut not in the least unfriendly. None of them ho re arms, wearing their lasers only on special occasions, and there were no soliiiers present with rifles. When the head man arrived, he was immediately friendly and hospitable, offering us tea and coffee. He was obviously much respected, everyone keeping silent when he spoke and doing as he ordered them. His name is Aha Salim bin Ahmed, hut everyone even the Shaikh, refers to him as ,, Aba ,, Salim - 'Father Salim' - as a mark of respect. He mentioned that the villagers were frightened by the surveying flags which had been erected on the island, and was very grateful when I explained that they meant no harm. Entirely through the good offices of Aba Salim in reassuring the natives I v/as able to examine some women patients despite the religious intolerance. Aba Salim himself led 16 patients back to the camp for treatment, which was a very tiring walk for an old man in the heat of the day. After treatment the patients were embarrassingly grateful, as was Aba Salim on their behalf. His confidence having been gained X mentioned that I was very keen to meet the Shaikh. He did not even attempt to conceal his contempt on the Shaikh, saying, when his name 'was mentioned 'Spit on his face',. Nevertheless much as he disliked the person, he maintained his loyalty to the Shaikh a s Shaikh . It v/as stated that the Shaikh was in Oman but that he visited Masira for a few days each montn. (It came to light later that the Shaikh was actually in Dthafyat the village to the north of Dawa where he had also been staying when the Political S ent had previously attempted to get in touch with m and v/as told he v/as at Sur.) Aba Salim promised to convey my message to the Shaikh, and to try to induce him to come to the camp. Later in the day, several people voluntarily came to the camp for medical attention. 28th January . At 1000, while attending to two female patients at the rest house 500 yards from the camp, a native messenger came running in a state of great excitement and announced that the Shaikh had arrived at the camp. When I got to tire camp, I found the two ratings rather dismayed, as 100 yards from the camp stood the Shaikh surrounded by 30 soldiers armed v/ith rifles, cartridge belts and daggers. However, v/hen I went forward and greeted him in Arabic, he v/as perfectly friendly, but obviously ill at ease and nervous. Through Hassan I explained the purpose of the camp and he said how grateful he v/as for the medical attention given to his subjects. His name is Shaikh Khamish bin Hilal - 'Thursday son of the Moon' - a wairy, beady-eyed individual of about 35. After he had been entertained to coffee he became more confident and I suggested that he should meet the Captain of 'Challenger'. _ At fi^gt jjg jrgfused Then, after many promises, oaths on etc. 2.—Te Mir 5 m l*°J M fl 28th January (continued). that he vrould not he poisoned, Killed or Kidnapped, he promised to meet the Captain at the camp on Thursday the 2nd February, Thursday being his luclcy day. He also promised to go on board the ship and to bring no soldiers. He gave permission to remain in the island, to shoot gazelle, put up marks, etc. Aba Salim was present but remained in the background, getting quite embarrassed i* any special favour was shown him in the presence of the Shaikh. He said the Shaikh vrould not have come to the camp _ had the ship not been beyond the horizon. 11 fresh medical cases were attended to many also returning for daily treatment. Four natives arrived from Marses by dhow after dark to hear outtalking box - gramophone - which was always a source of great amusement. They said they had been slaves in Jezirat Daiyinah under one called Hamwod bin Hamed, but had fled to Masira because of his cruelty six months previously, and were now soldiers of the Shaikh. ?.9th January. A large number of patients were waiting at the camp from early in the morning. Among thorn was Saleh bin Saeed, head man of Marses. In the afternoon I visited Dawa to see patients 'who could not walk to the camp. g Qt'n January . Again a large number of medical cases. Received a present of two live chickens from the village which were kept as camp pets; many offers of meat, eggs, fish. etc. which were declined. Several cases of dysentery were diagnosed in Dawa. The villagers had now become much more friendly running forward to meet us and calling the interpreter by nbnift Tnfl me 'Hakeem'. 31st Ja nuary . Today the natives celebrated the Mohammedan 'feast of 'Bekra-idd', and few came to the camp. In the afternoon I went to Dawa to study tne celebrations and was made most welcome. All tne inhabitants were dressed in clean clotnes, and many had the palms of their hands dyed with henna. 1st February. Today was also celebrated as a holiday 'amo'ig ih~e~Islanders, but several fresh.cases attended at the camp, and many returned to continue treatment. Drum beats could be heard from Dawa almost all day. 2nd Febr uary . In the early morning a dhow from Mahout anchored near the camp with four invalids seeking medical attention. This was proof of the comparative rapidity with which news travels to the mainland as we had only been in camp six days and these people stated2nd February (continued). tliat they had heard three days previously that there was a good HaKeem novr in Masira. One of these Patients was Saued hln Saeed, son of Saeed El Sultan, of Mahout and cousin of the Shaikh. The Shaikh had promised to meet the Captain of n Challenger tt at 1000 - today, without a bodyguard, and to go on hoard to he entertained. The Captain, First Lieutenant, and Paymaster-Commander landed at the camp about 0900. At 1000 natives started arriving at the camp from other villages, and the sound of drums could he heard from Dawa. At 1045 we were rather surprised to see a large banner approaching across the plain surrounded by 70 - 80 natives, singing and dancing to the sound of drums. The procession stopped 500 yards from the camp, and, as no further move was made towards the camp, Hassan and I went to meet it. The Shaikh was sitting in a circle with about a dozen soldiers and merchants. He greeted us nervously, and it was obvious he was not looking forward to the promised meeting. After about 30 minutes delay, the procession came to the camp, where all was confusion, people singing and dancing, and many whispering advice to the Shaikh. One merchant in particular Mahomed bin Khames, who could read and write, and had been to India, was overheard advising the Shaikh to order us to remove the surveying marks and clear out of the island immediately. He was one of my patients, and I later refused to give him further treatment. The Shaikh was perfectly friendly and reasonable in the privacy of a tent with the Captain but refused to go on board, apologising profusely and saying that if he went without his {over 80) followers they might shoot him when he returned. He became quite confident with the Captain, and explained that he had torn up a letter from the Sultan of Muscat some time previously (a testimonial carried by geolgists who lauded on the island by 'plane), because they had offended the villagers by paying too much attention to their womenfolk. The majority of the Shaikh's followers on this occasion were his soldiers. 3rd February. Awakened by singing from a dhow near camp’ at 0ISO. 6 fresh medical cases. Visited Dawa in afternoon to see patients and while photographing on the shore was approached by a soldier who became very menacing, loading his rifle, and accusing us of being spies. He was placated by announcing that we would report his behaviour to the Shaikh. Was entertained by the Shaikh in his house in Dawa. He later came to the camp on a white donkey with 8 soldiers. He was shown the chart and was very helpful checking, correcting, and making additions to the names. He showed an excellent knowledge of the local reefs and islets. He was also given medical attention for a certain complaint; was much more communicative and confident now, saying that he would like to visit the camp daily. 4th February . Shailch's brother and some soldiers4th February (continued). visited camp in morning. Later the Shaikh arrived and was full of confidence and very friendly indeed. He expressed his gratefulness to the 'Hakeem .and asked whatever was in his power to do, he would do it for him. He mentioned a monetary present of 500 'reals' (Maria Theresa dollars) which was declined with thanks. He stated he would remain in the island until the camp broke up, to protect us from his wild, ungrateful' subjects, and asked that the ship might leave as soon as possible as he wished to return to the mainland. It was apparent that his anxiety for our safety was only an excuse to prevent us becoming more friendly with the real Masira islanders, as they had from the start been friendly and hospitable. Only the ShaiMs soldiersand friends from the mainland showed any sign of enmity or ungratefulness. The Shaikh's brother took the interpreter aside and told him to ask the Captain for a monetary present ('backsheesh') for him, but to say nothing about it to the Hakeem or Shaikh. 5th February 1959 . Usual number of patients. 6th February 1939. Shaikh spent two hours in camp, becoming aTmos tembarrassingly friendly and intimate. The Shaikh's cousin and son of the Sultan of Mahout who had been receiving injection treatment, became so offensive that I refused to treat him more, but after the Shaikh had asked to continue treatment for his sake, as he wished to remain friendly with the Sultan, l did so. 7th February 1 959. This being the last day, there was a constant stream of natives at the camp, many merely to say'goodbye', others to get medicine to continue treatment, and a few to scrounge whatever they could. The Shaikh called and presented me with a fine silver mounted dagger and sheath. He bought it for 35 reals from a soldier after much haggling, mentioning that his own was not a sufficiently good one! He said how sorry he was he had not had a real feast in our honour but we would understand that he could not supply a table, forks and knives etc., and vie might not have enjoyed it. 8th February 1939. Camp broken up A.M. _ The Shaikh soent the whole morning at camp until we left, and was a'pathetic figure as he stood alone on the beach with tears in his eyes waving farewell. PAST II. SUMMARY. (a) MEDICAL. In all 64 patients received medical attention, 16 of them not natives of Masira but travelling merchants or Bedouins from the mainland 5 .'(a) MEDICAL, (continued.) some of whom came specially to consult me. Many attended daily for treatment. 15 minor operations were done under general or local anaesthesia - opening of ahcesses, operations for piles, enucleation of superficial tumours, extraction ox teeth, etc. Typhoid and dysentery are endemic. Malaria is only found in natives who have lived on the mainland. Eye diseases are very common. Smallpox epidemics occur about once a year, and two months previously 15 children died of it in Dawa alone. Phthisis is common. Several cases of venereal disease were met with, including gonorrhoea, congenital syphilis, secondary and tertiary syphilis. 4 cases of cancer in a late stage were seen. Owing to religious reasons female patients could only he examined under difficulties, and were always seriously ill. One woman in Dawa had a large ulcer of the ankle down to the hone, and gangrene of the toes. Her husband made the wound with his dagger ten months previously because she was eloping with another man; he also shot the man, but was in turn shot himself by order of the head man. Amputation was refused by the relatives despite the efforts of Aba Salim and the Shaikh, who fully realised the good it would do. Much valuable experience was therefore gained. The majority of the medicines used were medical samples in my possession and the cost in medical stores was negligible. Ho medical attention of any kind is available in the district. (b) POLITICAL. The largest village is Dawa (Daua or Datti on Chart). It consists of 45 dwellings made of dried palm sticks and wood, a white washed stone building near the shore which is used as a mosque, and two stone built store houses for dates and dried fish. There are between 450 and 500 inhabitants, but the population varies according to the number away fishing or trading. There are five wells in Dawa, giving the purest and most plentiful supply of water in the island - the water is dear and sweet. Aba Salim bin Aimed is the head man, owning 7 dhows, 3 camels and the stores. He was the most intelligent and helpful person met with, and is liked and respected throughout the island and as far as Has al Hadd on the mainland. He has oeen to Mecca. He would be Shaikh if the present line was broken, and would undoubtedly be most popular. His son, Hamood bin Salim was a soldier in the 1st Yemen Infantry 1919 - 1922 and can read and write a little; is now a soldier with the Shaikh.■■ (h) POLITICAL, (continued) . Dthafvat. miles to trie north of Dawa, is not marked on The chart. The Shaikh spends most of his time here when he visits the island for a few days each month. Hilf, to the north of Dthafyat, is another village riot marked on the chart. In order to the south of Dawa, the villages are named Marses (Umm-Rasas on chart), Suri- Masira, Safaie, Kalhan. Except Dawa, the population of each village is between 50 and 100, and there are a few scattered dwellings; so that the total population of the island cannot exceed 1000. The head man of Marses, Saleh bin Saeed, is a complete nincompoop, and it is suspected that the head men of the other small villages are in a similar category. Shaikh Khamish bin Hilal, aged about 35, is hereditary Shaikh of Masira, his family line unbroken for many generations. He is illiterate, but can speak Suris and Muscatese dialects. He is cunning. He lives mostly on the mainland, where he stated he 'was also Shaikh, and has property in Sur. He is intensely disliked and despised by everyone, even his own soldiers. The following reasons were given for this dislike;- He is cruel; he maltreats his five wives; he keeps boys and indulges in homosexual practices (this can be confirmed, as one of these transvestist boys was pointed out while being entertained by him); he is not a good Moslem; he has a monopoly of the local shark trade, and gives unfair prices that the natives are bound to accept. He is a weak character, and he is far to prone to accept advice from anyone. His brother has a charming personality, but is a rascal. The Shaikh has about 100 soldiers in all whom he pays 5 reals (Maria Theresa dollars) a month each, and some grain. They are generally a heterogenous crowd of ruffians, although there are some decent islanders among them. Many of them, auestioned as to their antecedents, became embarrassed, and refused to say. Some are runaway slaves, some fugitives from justice, and there are several Ethiopians who left Abyssinia three years ago. The Shaikh himself has a very low opinion of his subjects, and said quite frankly that cruelty was the only discipline they could understand. He owns loyalty to the Sultan of Muscat whom, he says, visits the island about once a year. He obviously pays more allegiance to the Imam of Oman, whom he considers superior to the Sultan. He says the Sultan comes under the British Government. Trade is done with Bombay, Karachi, Sur, Muscat, Mukalla, Aden, and all along the Arabian 7 .8. Qj) POLITICAL, (continued). coast. The chief export is dried shark. It was stated dates are brought from Zanzibar and sold in Muscat, which appears like taking coal to Newcastle. The natives can be classified as the real islanders; friendly and hospitable mostly fishermen: and the traders, merchants, soldiers and Bedouins xrom the mainland arrogant, uncouth ungrateful, wild, and difficult to get on with. The Shaikh himself was always friendly enough and easily managed in the absence of his advisers. His confidence was completely gained and he promised to be helpful to any of H.MJ Ships whenever he had tne opportunity. (o) METEOROLOGY. It was said it rains in Masira about once a year, generally in January. This is borne out by the many wadis near the hills, which must have been made by heavy rainfall. There were a few spots of rain on the 2nd February. It is cooler in Masira in summer than it is on the mainland. While in camp, the highest daily temperature was about 90°F. and the coolest (early morning) about 60°F. There is generally a heavy dew at night. (rO VEGETATION. Vegetation is sparse._ On the plains there are scattered succulents becoming succulent scrub in places near the hills. The local name for a yellow flowered sweet-smelling succulent found near the hills is 'mothadi' - water tree. Camels and gazelle eat it. In each village by the wells there are one or two fern palms. When it rains, it was said that tne plains become quite green. The hills are devoid oi vegetation. (e) GEOLOGY. There are signs of old copper ore ’workings in the southern part of the island. No ores are worked now. The island is of volcanic origin. Several coloured ore outcrops were found. (f) NATURAL HISTORY. Gazelle are numerous. Hyena footprints were numerous, but none were seen.. Camels are bred and roam the plains in tv/os and threes. Small harmless lizards are numerous. Two dangerous species of snake were described by the natives, said to be common when it rains.t • w * A'. ♦ - , * * *&lt;4 - - -(£) N ATURAL HISTORY, (continued) . One is called 'Abu seim' locally, and the other 'abu ra^at' described as the “bad one* and having v/ings - apparently a cobra. Snake bite is not rare. The common fly is a nuisance. No mosquitoes were seen. No other noxious arthropods. (a) ANTHROPOLOGY. Physical Character:- heterogenous mixture. Many pure negroid types, majority Bedouin. They are classified locally as (1) Bedouins - speak Arabic, physical character well known. They are the most numerous. (2) Suris - from Sur speak Suris dialect. (3) Muscatese - speak Muscatese dialect. (4) Zadis - from Daiyinab, long hair, short 'foota' (sarong), speak Arabic. (5) Mohatis - from Mobat, dress like Suris, but speak ordinary Arabic. (6) Abides - similar to Zadis. (7) Ethiopians - long curly hair, Moslems. Mode of subsistence:- Fishing and trading dried shark. Fish with shark nets, lines for smaller fish. Trade fish in India for money and grain. Date trade - no dates grown locally. They keep the following domestic animals:- cattle, goats, sheep, donkeys, poultry, cats, dogs, cajnels. Religion and Customs - have been studied and photographed, but are not included here. All are Moslems. Arts and Manufactures:- Cloth weaving. No metal working. Net making. No pottery. Personal ornaments, disfigurements, dances, etc. have all been studied and note and photographs will be available. The information obtained from the natives can only be taken critically, as they are notably lacking in accuracy and truthfaIness. Hassan Ramzan, the interpreter, merits the highest praise for the way in which he carried out his duties at the camp. Leading Telegraphist Damon, and Able Seaman Coates, did their work efficiently.

The following report on the attitude of the natives of Masira Island during the recent survey of Masira Channel is submitted for information. 2. * Challenger* arrived off the village of bnnn Kasas (now called Marses) a.m. 11th December 1938, and iAaj oi E.l. Watts, I.A. (Political Agent, Muscat) with his inter preter and myself, landed close to the village, which appeared de serted. 3. Enquiries from the crew of a dhow nearby elicited the fact that the Shaikh was *away fishing*. Subsequent enquiries at intervals during the course of the survey always produced the same answer, or the alternative that he was in the Oman. 4. As time was of consequence, and I wished to commence the survey as soon as possible, all available men in the vicinity were mustered. It was then explained that ’we should be erecting flags on many hilltops and on the shoreline, which we did not want taken down or otherwise touched. ^11 of them assured us of their help in this matter. 5. The villagers were extremely friendly, and with a view /i view to iiaproying relatione with them, I suggested that if there were any sick people in the village they might like to come on board and avail themselves of the services of the Medical Officer. lifter some hesitation, four came off that afternoon for treatment. 6. hiring the course of the next week, parties of three or four walked into the hills and erected marks where necessary as well as along the coastline. '.vhenever any natives were met, they appeared friendly. Major watts and his inter preter accompanied some of these parties, and in addition he went to the village of Kalban and talked with the inhab itants. 7. all marks wex-e left standing when the ship left for Karachi, and were intact on her return, although some doubt was felt on this point after leaving Muscat on the return from Karachi. It appears that a Geological Expedition had met with great unfriendliness a few days before. Wishing to use the island as a fuelling base for their fli &gt;v hts over i.he mainland, they had been furnished with a letter from the Sultan of Muscat asking the shaikh for his assistance. The Shaikh tore up the letter, had not allowed them to land, and had in fact more or less ordered them to leave, which they did. g # camp, consisting of two ratings and the Interpreter, was established on the shore of a small bay in the southern portion of the island, for the purpose of obtaining tidal readings. Parties of natives stopped at this camp for a chat from time to time, and all appeared very friendly. ihey v/ere always given a small present of rice, sugar, or biscuit, and /- ''v.iagi— Cb -3- and from odd hinte dropped f it became increasingly clear that the present Shaikh# Khamis bin Milal* is exceedingly unpopular with the islanders* He himsell is not an islander, but comes from Oman, where apparently he is also Shaikh of his district. 10. une day, at the request of the Headman of umm Kasas, I landed the Medical officer, Burgeon-Lieutenant William Bloan Miller, R.M., to attend a woman suffering badly from malaria, and he took this opportunity of attending many other native patients. 11 , 3urgeon-Lieutenant Miller was very keen to study the natives, and carry out medical work among them, ^nd with this in view, he approached me as to the possibility of establishing him in a camp on the shore near the village of iiaua, when the ship returned from Muscat at the end of January. He pointed out that this arrangement would greatly facilitate medical treatment of natives, v/hose natural shy ness prevented many of them going to the ship} further, it was thought that such an arrangement would gain the confid ence of the islanders, and improve our already xriendly relations with them. 12. Jaua is by far the biggest village in the island, and has a population of anything up to 450 people, mostly fisherfolk, while umm Rasas is nothing but a village of a few mat huts and mosque, and has a population of not more , than 80* \ V V N 13 , I discussed the desirability of the Medical '&gt;amp with the political Agent, Muscat, and he agreed that it would be an extremely good move, and the best poaeifclt way \ x of gaining the friendship and gratitude of the islanders. 14./ —■ppm -— m — ' ^ (feO h -4- 14. On returning to i&amp;asira, therefore, a carap waa eatabiished on shore about one and a half miles south of the village of Daua, combining the dual functions of medical and tide camp for the sounding of the northern section of the survey. 15. The personnel of the camp consisted of durgeon- Lieutenant W.S. Miller, H.2?., an Able oeaiaan trained in First Aid, a Telegraphist, and the iSative Interpreter - Hassan Ramzan. 16. Surgeon-Lieutenant Miller has furnished me with a detailed report of his activities, a copy of which is attached in the hope that it may be of interest. . I consider that it was largely due to the goodwill engendered by this Officer’s medical work among the natives that the surveying marks were not interfered with, and no difficulties with the islanders were experienced during the course of the survey. pa. The file of correspondence regarding &amp;asira, forwarded under cover of 3aet Indies communication So. 1721/8 of 30th October 1938, is returned herewith as reque sted. ■ 3d. (V) Baker Commander in Command.(Enoloaure to 'Ehallengar' a' Ifo.683/7 of 26th February 1939) H.M.a. , 'JHaXS^rG3H , • At *^ea. 23rd February 1939. oir, I have the honour to submit the following report on work carried out in camp on Masira Island from 26th January to 8th February 1939* lidiRATIVS (Confined to events thought interesting from a Service point of view). 2. 27th January 1959. On 27th January 1939 accom panied by Haesan, the native interpreter, I went to the village of Daua, about two miles north of the camp. As we approached we could see women and children running away, and hear shouts of “Farangie vagie H (Europeans coming). iVith difficulty the head man was found (Aba Salim bin ihmed) and I explained, through Haesan, that I wished to treat any villagers who were sick. He was grateful and hospit able. The other villagers were timid, but not at all unfriendly. “ith the help of Aba dalim in quelling the religious taboos (all are Moslems on the Island) I was able to examine and treat some female patients in the village, and Aba Ealim himself led sixteen patients back to the camp. 3. -ifter treatment, the patients were embarrassingly grateful, as was Aba Cali® on their behalf. His confidence having been gained, I mentioned that I was very keen to meet the Jhaikh. He did not attempt to conceal hie scorn of the latter, but much ae he disliked the person, he maintained his loyalty to the dhaikh as dhaikh. It was stated that the Shaikh was in Oman, but that he visited the island for a few days /- 2 - days eaoh month. (It Game to li&amp;ht later that Shaikh was xxxStaxttyxtatJUttot actually in Dthafyat, the village to the north of Daua» where he had also been staying when the Political agent had previously attempted to get in touch with him, and was told he was at Sur). aba Salim promised to convey my message to the Shaikh, and to try to induce him to come to the camp. 4. 28th January . On 28th January while attending to female patients at a rest house some distance from the camp, a native came running and stated that the shaikh had arrived at the camp. When I got to the camp, 1 found the two ratings rather dismayed, as about 200 yards away stood the Shaikh surrounded by thirty fully armed soldiers. However when I went forward and greeted him in Arabic he was perfectly friendly, but obviously ill at ease and nervous. Through Haasan, I explained the purpose of the camp, and he said how grateful he v/as for the medical attention given to his subjects. I reassured him that the surveying marks erected on the island meant him no harm, and after he had been entertained to coffee, he became more confident. I suggested that he should meet the Captain of H.M.3. Challenger. At first he refused, then, after many oaths on the Koran that he would not be poisoned, killed or kidnapped, an appointment was arranged for 2nd February 1939. He gave permission to remain on the island, erect marks, shoot gazelle, etc. 5, In the presence of the Shaikh, Aba Calim always takes a back seat, getting quite embarrassed if any special favour is shown him,*'' s c»r his opinion is consulted. He stated / jmmmmm 6? -3- stated that the Uhaikh would not have coi»e to the cajap had the ship been in eight. ufte islanders were always well informed about our movements. If I went shooting gazelle, the next day some native was sure to ask if we had got one, despite the fact that no-one had been visible for miles around. xhey could always tell us how many boats had left the ship, if there had been a party ashore, etc., although the ship was out of si^it, about fifteen miles down the coast. 6. As time passed, the natives became much more confident and friendly, and we were inundated with offers of meat, fish, dates, etc., most of which v/ere refused with thanks, although we accepted tv/o live chickens as camp pets. On 31st January an^ i 3 * February 1939 the islanders celebrated the Mohammedan feast of *Bekra- idd*, which made an interesting study. 7. 2nd February . On 2nd February a dhow from Mahut anchored near the camp with four invalids, who had cease specially to consult me, pruof of the relative speed with which news travels to the mainland. One of these was Saned, son of ^aeed bin Multan, Shaikh of Mahut, and cousin of the local Shaikh. 8. The Shaikh had promised to meet the Captain of H.M.S.Challenger today, without his “bodyguard*, and to go on board to be entertained. The Captain, Pirst Lieutenant, and Paymaster Commander had landed from the ship, and villagers from all over the island started to arrive at the camp. ^e could hear the sound of drums from Daua, and were later rather surprised to see a large banner /-4- 'banner approaching acroee the palin surrounded by 7 0-80 natives singing and dancing to the sound ol drums* ^he procession stopped 500 yards from the camp* and Hassan and I went forward to meet it* 'i'he Shaikh was sitting in a circle with a dozen soldiers and merchants. He greeted us nervously* and it was obvious that he was not looking forward to the promised meeting* -After 15 minutes delay* the procession came to the camp* where all was contusion* people singing and dancing, and many whispering advice to the Shaikh. One merchant in particular, Mahomed bin Khames, who could read and write and had been to India, was overheard advising the Shaikh to order us to remove the surveying marks and clear out oi the island immediately* He was one of my patients* and I later refused to give hill further treatment. 9# The Shaikh was perfectly friendly and reasonable in the privacy of a tent v/ith the captain* but refused to go on board, apologising profusely for his broken promise and explaining that if he went without his lover 80) followers, they might shoot him when he returned* after he had received a present from the Captain* he became more confident* and explained voluntarily that he had torn u^ a letter from the Sultan of Muscat some time previously* (a testimonial carried by geologists who landed on the island by ’plane), because they had offended the villagers by IpgdM* too much attention to their womenfolk. the Shaikh is illiterate. PO. 3rd February 1939* Gn 3rd ebruary* while taking notes and photographing on the shore at 3aua* we were approached by a soldier who accused us of being *apiea* /— - ' ' — -5- 'apies 4 , and. loaded his rifle in a threatening manner. He was placated by announcing that we would report his behavi oub to the Shaikh. ’^he Shaikh entertained us in his house at Daua the same day* and later came to the camp for medical treatment. He was now much more communicative and confident, and expressed a wish to visit the camp daily. H , 4th February 1939. On 4th February, the shaikh again visited the camp, full of confidence, and very friendly indeed. He expressed his gratefulness to the rt Hakeem* (Joctor) and said whatever was in his power to do, he would do it for him. He mentioned a monetary present of 500 reals (Maria iheresa dollars) which was declined with thanks. He stated he would remain in the island until the camp broke up, to protect us from his *wild, ungrateful subjects. It was apparent that his anxiety lor our safety was only an excuse to prevent us becoming more friendly with the real Hasira Islanders, as they had from the start been friendly and hospitable. Only the shaikh's soldiers and friends from the mainland showed any sign of enmity or ungratefulness. It is significant of the Ohaikh s previous contact with civilisation that he apologised ior not holding a real feast in our honour, by explaining that he could not supply chairs, table, forks and knives etc., and that we would probably not enjoy it. 12 . Prom this time the dhaikh s^ent many hours in camp, becoming almost embarrassingly iriendly and intimate. He presented me with a fine silver mounted da&amp;g ,er and sheath, and on the morning the camp broke up, by his own wish, he was the only“native present to bid an emotional \ k farewell. 13./ nizi-s~ 15 # 64 natives in genuine need of medical attention were treated, many of them attending daily* They came from all parts of the island, and some from the mainland. 15 minor operations were done under general or local anaesthesia. Medically speaking, the camp was a success. arkL I gained valuable experience. p 4 . dUMIiURY. ihe natives are frequently inaccurate and sometimes untruthful in their statements, but the information following is founded on intimate contact with them (many as patients) for a period of fourteen days. 15 (i) l-dl30IULITL3a . Shaikh Khemish bin Hilal ('Thursday son of the Moon') - a cunning individual aged about 40, is hereditary Shaikh of Maeira, his family line unbroken for many generations. He is illiterate, but can speak Suris and Muscatese dialects* He lives mostly on the mainland, where he states he i a also -haikh, and has property in dur. He is disliked by everyone, some fearing and others despising him, but as 3haikh his word is Law. Reasons for this dislike were as followsi- He is cruel; he keeps boys and indulges in homosexual practices ( this can be confirmed as one of his obviously transvestist youths was pointed out while being entertained k by him); he maltreats hie five wives; he is not a good Moslem; he has a monopoly of the local shark trade, and gives unfair prices which his subjects are bound to accept* he is a weak character, and is easily swayed by advice The dhaikh himself has a low opinion of his subjects, and said quite frankly that cruelty was the only disci line they could understand. He owns loyalty to the Sultan of Muscat, vdio, he says visits the island once a year. he obviously pays more allegiance to the Imam nf / 'k ' S ,Vmmm mtrmm 6 -J 7/~ •7- n rl of Oman, whom he considers superior to the Julian* He says the sultan comes under the British Government. rhe Jhaikh was always friendly enou ; ^h, but it takes time to gain his confidence. Towards the end of the camp, our wishes were carried out to the letter, and he promised to give all assistance within his power to any of H.M. Jhips if the opportunity arose. (ii) The Jhaikh*s brother usually accompanies him. He has a charming personality, but is a rascal. (iii) Aba S&amp;lim bin Ahmed is a venerable old man, bead man of Daua. He is admired and respected throughout the island, and as far as Has al Hadd on the mainland. Everyone (even the Ghaikh) refers to him as Aba Salim * father* Salim, as a mark of respect. Ke has been to Mecca. He would be Shaikh if the present line was broken, and would undoubtedly be most popular. He was the most intelli jent and helpful person met with, and was instrumental in our meeting the ohaikh. (iv) Jaleh bin Jaeed, headman of Itom-Aasas, is a complete nincompoop. As far as could be ascertained, the headmen of the other snail villages are in the same cate gory, and amount to nothing our side their own villages. ^ 5 . INHABITANTS . The natives can be classified as (i) the real islanders, friendly and hospitable and mostly fishermen, and (ii) traders, soldiers, and iiedouins from the mainland - arrogant, wild, uncouth, ungrateful, and difficult to gs* on with. 17 . The bhaikh has about 100 soldiers in all, whom he pays five reals a month each and some grain. ihey are generally a heterogenous crowd of ruffians, although there are some decent islanders among them. Many of them, questioned / j.—— ^ u •A 1 -s- y queationsd as to their antecedents, became embarrassed and refused to say* ^ome are TuuaviaLy slaves, some fugitives: from justice, and there are a handful cf Moslem Ethiopians afro left Abyssinia three years ago* 18* VIIXa(B3 * Daua is the largest village, consisting of 45 dwellings made of dried ^ aim stalks and wood, a white-wafahed stone building near the shore used as a mosque, and two stone-built stores for fish and dates. There are 450 - SCO inhabitants, but the population varies according to the number away in dhows. there are five wells giving th« pruest and most plentiful supply of water in the island. Dthafyat, 2** miles to the north of Jaua, is not marked on the chart. the Shaikh spends most of his time here vihen he visits the island. Hilf, to the north of Dthafyat, is another small village unmarked on the chart. In order, to the south of J&gt;aua, are Marses (Tfesn Rasas on the chart), dafaie, Suri-Kasira and italban. 19 . Except Daua, the population of each village is between 50 and 100, and there are a few scattered dwellings on the island, so that the total population is about 1,000. 20- TRATT* is done with Bombay, Karachi, Ituscat, Sur, Mukalla, Aden, and all along the Arabian coast. *me chief export is dried shark. It was stated dates are brought from V Zanzibar and sold in Muscat, like coals to Jfewcastle. 21. Gazelle are numerous.

Sir, I have the honour to report that by the courtesy of the Senior Haval Officer Persian Gulf on the 7th April I paid a visit to the Kuria buria Islands in E.l .8* 'V ildgoose” during ciy return Journey from Dhofar. Major Stewart Political Agent Muscat was also on board. £.

They were all poor specimens physically and the boys were miserably thin. They informed us that there are about 70 persons living on the island. They have been settled on the Island for a very long time and the oldest man in the party who wrs about 60 said he was born on it. They do riot know to what tribe they belong but say their language is Ghihri, and that it is the same as is spoken at Murbat. They also speak Arabic. They live by fishing, but own no boats and catch their fish mostly in basket-traps. The chief fish they catch is the ’safi* which they dry. boats from Murbat come from time to time to buy their fish and give them millet and other necessaries of life in exchange. Fishing-boats also come from Masirah to catch shark. They own about 60 goats but there has been no rain on the island for three years and the gracing is very poor, lie were taken to their village which Is a small collection of stone huts Inside some low hills at the western end of the Island. Prinkinj water Is said to be plentiful and we saw one well near the beach. No inhabitant* appeared except the party who first met us and we were told they were all fishing. The women had probably been hidden In the hills. The best house in the village was said to belong to one Hasir of bur who nad gone off with a cargo/ - 2 - of fish to Zanzibar leaving his family on the island. There 1«? no recognised Shaikh on the island and the oldest inhabitant is regarded as its head. The people vo talked to seemed surprisingly sophisticated and one of the first things they did when we came to the village was to produce some specimens of ore. They stated that the last European to visit the island was e Political Agent from Unseat in the time of Sultan Taimur who abdicated in 1932. It is believed that Simon de Hontfried nade use of the Island in tne course of his drug-trafficking activities. «&gt;e handed over some bread and cigarettes to the party which met us but were unable to satisfy their main requirement which war for sugar. 4. 1 am sending a copy of this letter to the Government of India, the Government of Aden and the Senior Kav&amp;l Officer Persian Gulf.
