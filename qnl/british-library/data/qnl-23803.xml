Should Shippers state that the Consignees have not received the stamped copies despatched to them, the copy retained can then be lodged with the Company's Agents at th« port of shipment who will arrange, at the Shippers' expense, with the Agents at the port of discharge to release any guarantee furnished by the Consignees to obtain delivery of the goods.

Dear Sir, We are in receipt of your letter of the 19th ultimo, and greatly regret that there has been a misunderstanding in re gard to your recent request for Wines and Spirits. When the Agency asked us during your last visit here to execute your order, Mr. Leaned, who received the message, did mention that no order had been received from you. As he did not think you were referring to para 3 of your Mr. Rogers’s letter to him dated 25th December, 1942, he enquired several times from Captain Dixon as to your requirements but got no reply as we under stand you were engaged at the time. Unfortunately, no shipments of whisky and gin have been made so far by our London people against our January to June quotas owing to the lack of shipping space and our supplies are now practically exhausted. In the meantime, however, we are reserving for you from our existing stock : Three Cases Black Label Whisky One Case Gin Twelve Cases Beer but regret we have no sherries of any kind and are not likely to get any in future. There has never been any question of a deposit being required from you, and we are retaining your letter of the 19th ultimo addressed to the Eastern Bank Ltd., instructing them to credit us with as. 1,000/- until we receive your further instructions as to your requirements. .igain regretting the misunderstanding, Copy to P.A.Bahrein.
