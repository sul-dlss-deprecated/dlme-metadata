Sir 1,0 r feurice de Bunsen's letter of the 30th ultimo (W. 28216/16), I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury to request you to inform Secretary Sir E. Grey that They sanction the fees proposed to be levied under the Bahrain Order in Council, 1913, in any Court established under that order. I am, however, to add that in giving Their sanction Their Lordships have been actuated by the consideration that the Imperial Exchequer is not affected inasmuch as They understand that the net proceeds of these fees will accrue solely to the Indian Exchequer. A comparison of the scale of these fees with those in force for Zanzibar and Abyssinia shews that the proposed Bahrain rates are very low and I am to suggest that the attention of the Secretary of State for India in Council might be called to this point. I am, etc., (Signed) Robert Chalmers. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.(10709.) ABYSSINIA ORDER IN COUNCIL, 1913 . Rules of Court for His Majesty’s Courts in Abyssinia. No. 1 of 1916.

Dear Sir, lour leo^er to Mr. Young about the appropriation of fees levied under the Bahrein Order in Council. Article 62 (3) of the Order provides that all fees kc. 'shall be applied in such manner as the S. of S., with the consent oi the ireasury, or, with the previous or 'subsequent assent of the S. of S., as the Govr. General of 'India in Council, may direct.' I am not aware of any further official ruling on the point; but (as may be gathered from correspondence sent home by the Govt, of India in December 1914) it appears to have been assumed that the fees kc. would be credited to Indian revenues, which bear the whole cost of the Bahrein establishment. If the Treasury wish to raise the question, had they not better do so officially? You know, I presume, that the Bahrein Order in Council has not yet been brought into operation.

On the other hand, 330 miscellaneous petitions were dealt with during the year against 244 in 1922. As pointed out in last year f s report, the large number of cases dropped by plaintiffs is due to a number of persons who come here for the diving season but leave after institution of proceedings and before the case can be heard, further, mere institution of proceedings frequently hastens adjustment of debts out of Court. The number of Criminal cases shows an increase of 60 compared with 1922. This increase is probably due to the absence of a Police force during the disturbances of Bamadhan, when it was temporarily disbanded, being composed mainly of Persians, a party in the affray* The total number of Civil c, nd Criminal oases, token together, exceed the number for 1922 'bj 32.

Under the Bahrein Order in Council, 1913, section No .68 has oeen granted Notarial Powers and under these and these powers he can therefore register documents etc. but powers do not appear to include registering Births. Deaths marriages. There is a considerable European, American and Christian population and this is likely to increase and the only official there is the Political Agent. It is therefore, in my opinion, very necessary that he should have powers to register Births, Deaths and marriages. but while I^see the necessity for making the x p olitical ^ a registrar of Births, Deaths and marriages, I regret that my c knowledge of legal particulars of the subject is insufficient to enable me to suggest how this should be effected. If the Political Agent were wade a Marriage Officer, and I think in some ways it would be a good thing if he were made one, he would of course be a ole to register marriages, -^s regards registering Births and Deaths I am not sure whether it would be possible^o make -act vl of 1886 applicable to the Bahrein Islands and appoint the Political Agent a registrar under that, or whether it would oe necessary to make an amendment to the Bahrein Order in Council; if the latter this might perhaps be done by the addition to Article 68 of the words 5f and the Political Agent shall be marriages entitled n to act as a Registrar of Births, Deaths and If however the Government of India are pleased to approve of the suggestion that the Political ^ent at Bahrein should be a Registrar, the method of giving-effect to it can doubtless easily be decided by the Law Officer^.:- I would further suggest that if the Political Agent is mad^j&amp;Registrar of Births the point might be borne in mind vifiSh' the Order in Council ho welt is eventually drafted and the Political Agent there granted the same powers. f-‘ etc. for . 0 .

In all States and well managed Governments, the affairs of each town are managed by a specially selected body of men called municipal Councillors. . ysanitation, and general well being. In short, the Ruler himself; this being the case this body of men of the people entrusted to its charge. 2. It is a principle of Government among all States that no portion of the general Revenues of the country, should be expended on the improvement and management of the Towns. The Towns should be self- contained. They should have their own sources of Revenues, which should be expended in the town only; the collection of this revenue inside the towns is entrusted to the Municipality aided by certain approved Officials; for our purpose w&gt;e will call them the Mudir- al-Balladiyeh, Mamiurs, Katibs, Mukhtars, etc. • /I ^ the Municipality has no right to make any demands for ' money on the Ruler since it is given the right by the I Ruler to collect certain taxes in order to pay for tke machinery necessary to run the town. 4. For tne maintenance of Law . Older and discipline in a town an official styled an Amir or Hakim al Balad is usually selected - His duties are those of Governor and chief of Police combined - He works in the closest connection with and assists w - — — —w A Wi A A w J* X X W J. m » \ !These are responsible to the State or Local Ruler for | / I I the proper management, of the town, its taxation. Happiness, health and prosperity of the townspeople | ar e placed in the hands of this body of men by the I which we will call the 'Municipality 11 is responsible I iirstly to God and then to the Ruler for the welfare 3 It follows then that in managing a town. the* VTO the Municipality to the best of his po?;er; the pay of this official is usually found by the State, ano in the case of Bahrain should be found by the Ruler. The pciy oi his night watchmen, however, whether they look after the bazaar, or the rest of the town should be found by the Municipality, out of Municipal revenues. 5. it is the right of a Municipality to tax every person residing in its town irrespective of nationality: It is the right of the citizens of a town who pay taxes to hage a voice in the expenditure of the taxes they pay and at any moment they have the right to demand scrutiny of the Municipal books. 7 • No person living in a City has a ri^it to refuse to pay the taxes imposed on him by the Municipality provided these do not exceed what is just, and provided as in the case of Bahrain such taxes are approved by the Ruler and the Political Agent. It is a point of principle also that no man should be free from taxation. H. EBfiPQSSD MANAMA MUNICIPALITY (Balladiyeh) (a) Composition A president (Rais al Balladiyeh) . Nominated by Shaikh Isa.

I am taking him gently at present and putting things as simply and briefly as possible to him I did not submit t in writing until I could form an idea from the interview wha lines I should take and while not wishing to be premature I have got the impression from his attitude that the matter will be amicably settled. In answer to my remark on departure that H.B.H.'s Government had shown him every consideration and granted him a great concession in jurisdiction out of personal friendship and esteem and that on this account I felt sure / &gt; he would increase the confidence of the said Government by a favourable answer J he replied ’’Please God it will be good;' I will telegraph fully when matters have taken a definite aspect.

The adoption of any other course would I think be inconsistenl with the expressed Policy of K t * K’a. Government in these regiond. I recommend that the announcement be made at the earliest possible date as an act of grace by the British Government and an earnest of our intentions towards Amb rulers. It srem® unnecessary and undesirable to crll for th* agreements or to adless the Chiefs concerned: their concurren ce may and should be taken for granted.S.Ab regard* Khldma I 1 al bo agree with Ca :) t B in Loch's proposals would propose to inetr.uct the Political Agent, in announcing the decision of Government in regard to the question oi Jurisdiction when received, to settle th* question of *Khidma' on these lines.

Meanwhile the ,, khidma ,, question ha- to be settled. In my letter 2120 dated 1st November 19H5 to Government (extract attached) I said you would address Government on this subject in due course. I attach a copy of -vaj or Keyes letter of 28th lay 1915, which gives his views on the matter. I agree with i-ajor Keyes that it is advisable that in cases where a Bahrain ubject is involved 'khidma 11 should be levied at the rate of lf&gt;j£ as formerly. I was under the impression that the question of 'khidma* had been thrashed out some years avo but I cannot find any record that it was. -lor does there appear to be any recor as to how the Agency Court started paying , ♦khidma ,, to the Shaikh at such a high rate. I imagine, however, that the prac ice imply grew up as in the local Courts th 1 Shaikh was in the habit of collecting lf$ *khidma' from any sums realised and that it was thought (and rightly no doubt) tha' t* ^ Shaikh ’ould demur less to the transfer o a large proportion of his judicial rights to the Agency Court, if he re ceived his usual fees. ^ajor Keyes estimates the annual receipts from 'k’-idma' less that on ca es in which Bahrain subjects are involved, at about 3,60c 7 - per annum an suggests that we should offer the Shaikh **300 - per mensem as compensation lor the Ions which will it cun d hy him on the introduction of the new ystem. -i I think this proposal i ? a good me, 'khidma* having been recovered and paid to the shaikh for years we cannot ignore his claim to comsensation. Besides this-- ''''St this as ^ajor Keyes points out the process serving and other services for the Agency Court have Keen done by the Shaikh's officials. Very badly it is true until the retirement of the old #Amir of Kanawa' - while he was there, Political Agents anxiously awaited the time when the Court could, have its own officers - but matters are better now. In any case all processes to be served outside thp actual own of vanaraa would have to be dealt with by the Shaikh's officers. If it is agreed that the best arrangement is to compound with the Shaikh abou the 'Khidma' it remains to be decided whether we should address Government at once making the suggestion to offer the Shaikh 300 - p.m. in lieu of Khidma, or whether before coing so we should ask Kajor Stewart to sound the Shaikh on the subject. Possiblv th* latter course would h« best, as we should look rather foolish if the suggestion was sanctioned and the Shaikh proved obstinate and declined to accept the arrangeraent. . We might of course if we adopted the othrr method tell the shaikh that the time had arrived for a regular Court and that in regular Court a xixed scale of f es were charged in all countries, that once we started re gular fees it would be impossible to levy 'khidma' in addition, but that a careful examination of accounts show-d that in years of much litigation 'khidma' on suits in which Bahrain subjects were no^ involved averaged Hs.3,600(1/- P pr annum, and we had therefore decided to pay him t is sum regularly at 300 - p.m. We might add that originally the practice of levying 'khidma' wMch is opposed to the practice of British Courts grew up without the sanction of the Government, but Government did not .wish him to be a loser by the introduction of some regular legal methods and so offered 300/- P-m- as compensation. He could then take it or leave it.

X XX rJO3 the Poll' ical Ap’ent, Bahrain to the Officer on Special Outy, Bushire. 1 have the honour to address you on the/suhject of the f ^es to be charged un der the Bahrain Order in Co ncil. 2. The system at present in vogue is a' follows:- In Criminal cases no fees are charged. In ordinary oivil suits and in administration, and 'bankruptcy proceedings no fees are charged for any orocess, or for hearing th suit; hut 1/10 of any amount oaid into Court, or collected by the Court o~ the local officials is paid through the Agency to the Sh ikh or his officials under the name of 'khidma*. It is on this ,, khidIna ,, that the ohnikh chiefly relies for the remuneration of the Amirs of Manama and Fuharraq and their fa awis. The natural outcome of thi custom of only taking fees on amounts collected through the Court is the following excellent practice: A man who has a claim against another puts in a petition: in about 50 per cent of the cases the claim ir admitted, and a promise is/made of weekly payments in the case of shopkeepers, or instalments at one or other of the seasons in the case of people interested in the penrl trade. The time of the Court taken up by cases of thi description amounts to a lew minutes on f j ach ot t,woi)days and only a very small number of suits are followed by execution proceedings in which money is actually collected and •khidma' paid. The total amount of *Khidma' paid to the Bhaik&gt; and hi ^ officials amounted in 1913 to Ps. 2,255 - and in 1914 to I?-** 3,70s/- this latter sum represents all the fees taken on suits of a t tal value of atoout ?*5,00,Wfr/- It mu fit be noted that 'khi -ma' is taken, not only when one ol the parties ia subject oi the Shaikh oi Bahrain, but even when both parties are British subjects Ooo or foreigners3. he institution of a, regular an i inelastic scale i feeM on institution of suits, however light the fees mignl be, would inevitably cause a very considerable amount oi discontent among people who have been accustomed onl/ to pay lor results and would tend to check these amicable settle, ments. In the attached table I have suggested a form of fees .0 meet the case, T.S. a fee of p^g-B-O for ecisions in suits settled by consent without hearing witnesses* I hove also suggested a jbaxscxsrrfwextaxmeetxtkwirauni much lower scale for the f^e on the institution of an ordinary suit than is taken in Bushire i.e, p a 2-8-0 cent as arainet 3 annas in the rupee, but I hav^ suggested p a 7-8-0 per cent as a *fee on amounts collected by the Court. These three provisions while upsetting local custom n&amp; lit + le as possible, hould brin^v in considerably more than the present ‘♦khidraa 1 '* ^he same principle has been followed in suggesting fees for administration and bankruptcy oroceedings in w' ich l/lO ,, kbidma ,, is now taken. The other fees suggested are modifications of th-^ Bunhire scale calculated to cuit th^ poorer classes in Bahrain who provide the majority of u i t s. The * forme‘pauperis' clause i taken from ' ; ection i 61(2) of the °rder in Council. I have excluded nroceedings in which Bahrain subjects are concerned from the list of fees under the headings 'Ordinary Suits', 'Probate and Administration' and 'Bankruptcy and Liquidation' but consider that Ijj subjects should pay all other fees. This question will be de It with in para, 5. 4, It is impossible to estimate with an/ confidence the amounts which will be realised by these fees. In 1914 2872 summonses were served through the Shaikh’ officials, u‘ this was a year of excessive litigation, and it wouldnot bv. afe o estimate t.ne receipts rom riUmmonses at tore than Ha.1,000/-. ine system 01 registration in vogue be lore 1914 amkes it almost impossible to compute the money value of all suit ! Imring the year. The value of suits during 1914 amounted to 5 lakhs, but the fees on th.f estates ol deceased persons and bankrupts were formerly in cluded in the ^khidma' and it is now impossible to se parate all the accounts. Not- only was 1914 an ex ceptional year from th^oint of view of litigation as several lar -e pearl suits were decided in which Bahrain subjects were narties, but the imposition of a few on the institution of a suit will tend to reduce the number of suits filed, and I do not think that we can rrl ' on rec iving more than Ps.2,000- per annum for fees for institution, ani for decisions without hearing witnesses. Fees for execution proceedings will dir inish, no- onl7 an account of the reduction in rates from 10 to 7/8 - pe cent, but on account of the exclusion of xxtts suit in which Bahrain subjects ar^ parties and 500/- may be tak^n as a fair figure. If we take R&amp;50O.A for fees under other heads, the total cstim ted fees will be -^6,000. This is of course exclusive of fees taken in cases in which ^ahrain subjects are parties. 5. Th rc remain to be considered the principles governing the Shaikh of Bahrain's right to fees levied by the Agency Court A t^ take fee* from %hr*in subjects. It must be remembered that the Agency Court possesses no process se iwers and that all summons etc. are served by the Shaikh's officials whose remuneration is largely drawn rom fees received -rom the Agency. The7 'tie only a dm ini st ative functions performed 'by the a££±ixi officials oi the Coui*t nre!. Sealing of premisee ! aking inventories of effects Conducting ales * Keeping possession of effects, Wt must now ask the Shaikh to forego the ten per cent 'khiama w on all suits in which both parties ^ither British or Foreigners. Ae regards suits in which one party is -^hrain subject i: would oe derirable irom the point of view of uni formity to have the same scaled for thessuits, but the iuea ol taking a percentage of the claim in advance when the Plaintiif has possibly no chance of obtaining the full amount ol the claim, or lias no intention oi saeing for execution, is RO foreign to Arab ide s of Justice that I would suggest that 'khidm# be levied as heretofore in all cases in which one party is a Bahrain subject and o? id to the Shaikh, If this principle be accepted it will only remain for us to compensate the Shaikh ior the loss of 'khidma' is suits in which none of hi subjects are concerned. Of the Ps.3,708 - which received in 'khidma** last year p a 396/- wa:? received in cases in which his subjects were concerned, leaving 3, 312 - received in British and Foreign cases, I would therefore suggest that I may be allowed to offer Shaikh Isa Ps.300 7 - per mensem as compensation for loss of 'khidma' in British and Foreign cases and may inform him that 'khidma* in other ca es will be paid to him as hereto fore • 6. As regards registration, in view of the property of th Persian and Ottoman subjects who form a large percentage of the persons to whom the orde * applies, I t&gt;ink that re. 1/- on registration and -/8/- on annual renewal will be sufficient.7. In conclusion I think it advisable that the suggested scale of fees should he introduced as a tentative £ m^asur-e, and that a report should be submitted after a complete year*s wo iking, i.e. after 1st January 1917.Copy of letter So. 359, dated 7th l ay 1917, from the Political Agent, -ahrain,, to D.P.R.

As you are aware, Shaikh Ish's endeavour® to deal with cases connected with Hasawis are a constant source of friction between him and the Political Agent, and oi late he has renewed his activities in this direction; a recent case^, eported in my telegram No. 16-C of February 15th, 1917, was tided over by informing Shaikh Isa that the Government of India were too busy with work connected with the war to deal with such a problem as a change of jurisdiction and that pending their decision he must not upset the existing order of things, and there is little .oubt that he will bring this question up as soon as the introduction of the Order in Council is mooted. He contends ( and rom the Agency records it appears that he contended verbally both befor&gt; and after writing his letter) that hi' letter oi July loth, 1909, giving jurisdictionjurisdiction over foreigners to the ^ritish Gove nrnent, ' ,,r as ot meant to include the subjects of the Arab Chiefs wi h ^ r hom h had these agreements; .1 o the* now Bin Sa’ud i * is no longer a vassal o.

There seem to be two courses op n to us:-. Firstly . definitely to inform Shaikh Isa once for all that no infringement of our jurisdiction over these els secs will he tolerated, and to uphold our ecisior. Secondly , admit Shaikh lea's contention, re serving to ourselves the ight to intervene in case of any serious miscarriage of justice. The latter course is strongly ad ocated, ior with the passing of Turkey and the entry of Bin Sa’ud and the Shaikh of Qatar into treaty relations with ourselves, the chief reason for retaining our jurisdiction m &amp;hrain over the subjects of the Arab Chiefs oi the ^ersian Gulf lit 4 oral loses Hs weight, and, p ovided that the several Chiefs concerned are content to allow ohaikh a to de;.l with their subjects, the chan e would oiler the following advantegee:- t It would (l) remove a constant s^ irce oi ^riction I 1 I V, M between■between Shaikh l 8a and the Political A^ent, (2) be a powerful inducement to Shaikh Isa to accent the Order in Council without trouble and afford proof both to him and to Me subjects that the 0rd * r in Counci l ^ cot intended to infringe on his authority, (*5) rnak- a graceful concession in recognition 0f 1118 ^P^ved bearing towards reforms and oi his attitude during the war, and (4) id us of a considerable number of petty and vexatious cases in the Court. Further, should 'Bin Sa’ud establish a port of bin own, as is understood to be Ms intention, Bahrain will cease to be of so great importance^as it. is to-day, and it it is to be granted, the conce sion of jurisdic tion should nr- made while it yet has a high value in the egres of Shaikh Isa. dh following action is, therefore, euggestedt- (1) Shaikh Isa should be asked to oroduee his agreements, and copies, compared and certified by him end Political Agent, should be obtained. (2) The Chiefs concerned should oe asked if they are willing to abi e by the agreements, subject to our intervention in case of any serious miscarriage of justice* (3) Shaikh Isa should be informed that the Government of India have considered his request, and are prepared, subject to the reservation regarding intervent ion, to grant him jurisdiction over the subjects of the signatories to the agreements, and at th s me time propose to put the Court in Bahrain on a regular footing. * AsAs regards the settlement oi lOf now levied on all sums coll the 'khi^nah' ( a fee ected through the Court and paid to the Shaikh) question, -x- plan put i orward hy or •‘■^eyes See his letter To. oflay'iMth 1915, to the Officer on Special Duty, Bushire.

In that c^se question of protection of Hasawi, etc. would undoubtedly be raised.
