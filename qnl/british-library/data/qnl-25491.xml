His Highness the Sultan has been repeatedly urged to expedite justice. A considerable improvement is expected when the English adviser arrives. If it was not for the unremitting efforts of the Agency Dragoman it is doubtful if any cases would ever be finished. In future it will be advisable to hear certain special cases in Muttrah to avoid the delay and expense caused by bringing over large numbers of witnesses to Maskat. The services of an Arabic clerk, as has been urged in my 2082 of 1st November 1919, are absolutely necessary to enable the Dragoman not only to cope with the Judicial work but to attend to his Political work which is infinitely more important. At present he is immobilised by a mass of peti* tions, registering and copying documents, attending the Mahkumah for houra on end, eta, I hope this assistance will be available shortly. The amount of fees recovered was Rs. 2,163-10-0. As far as possible cases are settled without litigation under Article 10 of the Order and r as previously reported a considerable amount of time of the Court is taken un with cases which do not appear in the above lists. 1,051 petitions in connection with legal cases were received during the year.

The Arms Traffic is at present dead, out trie present circumstances are altogether exceptional, and in view of the enormous profit to be made, it is not to be expected that when trade is once more freer; from war ' restrictions, attempts will not be made to revive it. (o) Article 82 of the Order really lays down the principle to which the present King's Regulation gives force and effect. The gravamen of the objection taken by the Government of India to the King's Regulation as published is that the acts to he penalized are not clearly set out, and it would, no doubt, he possible, though in the highest degree improbable, for the Political Resident to penalize an act done without criminal intent, by declaring it ex post facto to have been a breach of a recognised law or custom. To avoid this drawback, I suggest that the King's Regulation might he amended, the words 'recognised local law or custom' being replaced by the words 'duly promulgated local law or regulation of His Highness the Sultan of fuscat'. This phrase would naturally include the Arms Regulations, and the objection of lack of clearness would be done away in as much as it is the duty of a foreigner, resident in any country, to inform himself of its laws as duly promulgated* IfIf the G-overament of India, concur the necessary action will be taken in due course® I have, etc*, Sd/~ A.T♦Wilson, Lieut *Gol *, I *A •, Acting Oivil Oommissioner in Mesopotamia♦Simla, the 9th April 1919* Sib, With reference to Article 85 of the Maskat Order in Council, 1915, we have the honour to forward, for the information of His Majesty’s Govern- ment, a copy of a report by our Political Agent at Maskat on the working of the Order for the year which ended on the 31st December 1918.

To remedy this anomaly the Political Resident has directed that use should be made of the power conferred on him by the p proviso attached to Article 80 (1) of the Maskat Order in Council now in force, and that the Stiltan's Arms Warehouse Rules should be published as a King* s Regulation to come into force in the area concerned immediately. regulation 3.

It consists of a preamble and penal clause, followed by the Sultan's proclamations put together and printed as an appendix, together with the rules issued by the Arms Warehouse Superintendent* under His Highness* authority. The penalty fixed has been taken from the Indian Arms Act (Act XI of 1878 ). It refers only to breach of the rules framed by His Highness in his proclamations. A breach of the Superintendent*s rules published under His Highness* authority can be dealt with under Article87 (2) of the Maskat Order in Council. 4 , A copy of this letter has been sent direct to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign mA Department for information.

I am in receipt of your No. 295 dated the 12th February 1917. The instructions in your No. 1842 dated 4th November 1916 being to dispose of the matter under Section 27 of the New Order in Council I went into the case and carne to the same decision as my predecessor that there was no 'evidence of any judicial value whatever'. Indeed, except hearsay, there is no evidence at all and as far as can oe seen any evidence which could he obtained would he tainted and hardly sufficient for conviction. I accordingly did not proceed farther with the matter: I trust that No. 5626 dated 31st October 1916 from the Chief Political OificeT to your address did not mean that it was considered that the evidence was sufficient to convict, I only read it that the section was sufficient to cover the oxfence . On account of the close connection of the Sultan with the affair I would personally deprecate any action in a case which, I would respectfully submit, it would he extremely difficult to prove, which would, to the public eye, appear to bring us into opposition with His Highness and in which if we faiMc# to bring off the result we desired we should appear to have been over reached while^. if we did succeed would make us appear to be giving^snub to His Highness. Were the Sultan definitely proved by private enquiry to be implicated it appears to me to outweigh the importance of the Hindu concerned and would necessitate a private and grave remonstrance addressed to His Highness. Ths case if true, and I have no douht truth underlies the statement made, shows that all the offenders havehave received indirect punishment, end it would in the circumstance appear more important to take measures xor the future then to press further in the matter for the present* As you &amp;re oware I have been going carefully into the subject of the Arms Traffic which still exists and am submitting suggestions to you. With reference to the framing of New King’s Regulations I have in this, as in other matters for which there was no immediate urgency, preferred to give myself a few months to understand more fully the circumstances of this place before putting suggestions which might be the result of thought but half matured, I have now completed three months in Muscat and feel myself more competent to form opinions of value and am accordingly putting on paper the results which wixl shortly be despatched to you*8 Ao.

Sir, With reference to your telegram No# 51 dated the llth January 1918, I have the honour to report that, since forwarding the suggestions contained. In my No. 63-C dated the 21st March 1917, I have taken no further action In the question of Arms Traffic. I did not proceed v/ith the framing of a King* s Regulation In connection with the Sultan of Muscat's Arms Warehouse Rules; as there are no stocks of arms in Muscat any Infringement of the Regulation would he drought under Article 27 of the Muscat Order in Council. Since however neither this Order id Councj.1 nor the Arms Warehouse Rules contemplate the abetment of an Offence and the Ofder in Council does not mention the offence of being in guilty possession of smuggled property some extension would appear to be required. On the other hand if an order were published by which the Arms Warehouse Rules would be extended to British subjects, the subjects of Foreign Powers , in treaty with His Highness the Sultan, would be in a position to argue that until the same course were followed with reference to them, they would not the subject to the Rules in question. We might equally be brought into friction with powers not in treaty with His Highness concerning offences committed by their subjects.The necessary power to deal with this question could he given under Sections 31 and 82 of the Order hut with reference to Section 82 there appears to he no method, other than personal influence or political prestige, W which the Political Agent can carry out the enforcing 4f customs referred to therein while with reference to Article 31 there appears to he no penalty named in any treaty or in the Order In Council* There would also appear to he no method of punishing a British subject in Oman -for the infrlgement of any local law or for*any offence against the Sultan authority or that of his Officials, I would then suggest that to place of framing a King's Regulation which would deal with the infringement of rules in connection with the Arms Warehouse a Regulation should he made which would deal with alD the points above- mentioned and which would at the same time Include offences in connection with arms and ammunition. ! attach herewith a draft Regulation which, having regard to the Articles above referred to, and Articles 79 ( 3 ) and 80 ( 3 ), would appear to meet all requirements.

British Residency and C6nsuiate-C*eneral, Bushire, 15th July 1918. To The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf j Baghdad* Memorandum* Please refer to correspondence ending with your telegram No. 1015 dated 9th February 1917, on the subject of possible amendment of the Muscat Order In Council, The history of the matter Is briefly as follows:- On 7th October 1916 Major Howell pointed out that the Order In Council provides no means of punishing a British subject for ingringement of the Sultan's Arms Warehouse Regulations, He forwarded a draft King's Regulation under Article 80 of the Order in Council, Imposing on British subjects a penalty of imprisonment for a tern which may extend to three years, or fine, for any breach of His Highness' rules. On 31st October 1916 you telegraphed that the particular case then pending could ds decided under Article 27 of the Order in Council, directed Major Haworth to deal with that case on Its merits, and pointed out that the question of applying the Sultan's rules by King's Regulation could be considered later. On 25th January 1918 Major Haworth forwarded, with his letter No. 214, copy of which Is attached , a draft King's Regulation, conferring upon the Political Resident the general power to declare any act to be a breacn of £* 8 P£ recognised local law or custom', and imposing the same penalty as that suggested by Major Howell for a breach of such law or custom. AsAs the matter did not appear urgent, I postponed comment on It until I could discuss it with Political Agent lAiscat. I was myself under the impression that the provisions of Articles 27 and 28 of the Order in Council would meet the vast -majority of cases, and that the publication of a special King's Regulation specifically applying the Arms Warehouse Rules would merely draw attention to the fact that other foreign subjects were not liable to any specific penalty for a breach of the rules, without any counterbalancing advantage. Major Haworth, however, lays considerable stress on the fact that Articles 27 and 28 would only apply to the actual importers, while the mere possession of Arms, contrary to rule 2 of the Sultan's rules, could not punish ed . This is a good point; at the same time I consider that the above objection to the puolicatiou of a spec^^i- Kihg's Regulation has great force. Major Haworth's draft King's Regulation is free from this objection; at the same time it is very sweeping in its scope and I think the Law Officers would take the view that if so general a power is to be conferred upon the Political Resident its proper place is in the body of the Order in Council end it could hardly be properly conferred by Regulation. There would seem to be no objection to the Sower in itself, which is impliedly contained in the vaggre provisions of Article 82. That Article is sweeping enough as regards the Political Resident's powers of interpretation, but is silent as to the means byuwhich those powers are to be translated into action. m my opinion , the best solution of the difficulty would be an amendment of Article 82 , as in the draft attached. If you consider that such an amendment has little chance of being taken up at present, I would recommend that the whole matter should be dropped, and that we should re^ly on the deportation sections to enable us tom * to deal drastically with any case of Improper possessloa of arms on a scale Indicating an Intention to traffic In them . The question of abetment Is covered by Sect on Indian Penal Code read with Section 4 (o) criminal Procedure Code although there would appear to be a legal difficulty involved In the conflicting definitions of the word 'offence' in the Indian Penal Code and Criminal Procedure COde, In the former, (Section 40), an ofience is de.u ne ®s'a thing, made punishable by the code itself, or.special ' or local law as therein defined. And a local law is defined as 'a law applicable only to a particular part of British India'. In the Criminal Procedure COde, on the other hand, an offence is defined as 'an act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force'. I imagine that there would be no legal objection to the use of the second definition to make punishable the abetmen of. an act made punishable by a law infforce in Muscat,!£n£lde 2 ii 2 l* From The Deputy Secretary to the Govommeat of Indi^' in the Foreign and Political Department, Lieutenant Colonel A,T, Wilson, C*M*G* t C* I,h* # D, Officiating Civil Coramissioner, Doted Delhi,, the Novemher 1918* air. With reference to your letter No* 18957/8/10, dated the 11 th beptember 1918 , forwarding a draft of an urgent King’s Regulation under Articles 78 and 80 of the Maskat Order in Council, 1915, I am directed to point out that the Regulation, in its present form, makes no reference to the Arms Traffic, for the control of which it is designed, but merely enacts by reference the whole of the 'Local Laws and Customs* of Maakat* 2. The essence of legislation of any kind, and more especially of penal legislation, is that the law should be reasonably clear and thao the acts which are to be penalised should be stated with precision* The present Regulation makes no attempt to do so and goes far beyond the object with which it was framed. 3 .

Bir:- s' ( A A /urfZ cv Foreign Office May 9th, 1914. / I am directed by Secretary Sir b.Grey to state, I for the Information of the Larquess of Crewe, that he has had under consideration your letter P. 909,of the 7th ultimo enclosing a copy of the draft Mskat Order 1 in Council with the amendments to be Introduced in order to give effect to the views set forth in your letter of January 6th last (P. 4487). ? Sir E.Grey observes that provision has accordingly been made for the exercise of jurisdiction over such foreigners as have been placed by the head of their state under the jurisdiction of His majesty, by the insertion in article 8 of the draft Order of c provl sion, such as appears in the Persian Coasts and Islands Order in Council 1907, and in various other Orders. I The question however^ arises, in view of the form which this article has now assumed, whether provisions should be inserted expressly providing for the exercise of \ vi ci MA,i »- The Under Secretary of State, India Office. /(15635/14). of Jurisdiction over the property and ships of such foreigners, or whether jurisdiction should he confined to the property and ships of British subjects only, as under the Persian Coasts and Islands Order in Council. The former course was adopted in the Bahrein Order in Council, hut the latter is that usually adopted. 4. . The amendments which would he necessary to make / this article conform in this respect to article 8 of the Bahrein Order in Council would appear to he as follows r After the words: 'British subjects' in §5, Insert 'and of foreigners within sub-article '^3) . After the words: 'British ships' in §6, insert 'and ships belong- ing to foreigners within sub-article (3)”, and in the same §, after the words 'this Order”, add 'provided that jurisdiction over foreign ships shall not he exercised otherwise than according to the practice of the High Court in England in the exercise of jurisdiction over foreign ships'. (/ Sir E.Grey is inclined to think that it would he preferable not to introduce into the present draft the special provisions of the Bahrein Order in Council, whichof Bahrsin, but rather to follow in principle and in detail, as is being done so far as this particular article is concerned the more usual form prs'sentsd by the Persian Coasts and Islands Order. which is a usual provision; and article 8 (4) of the present draft, which would then appear to be unnecessary, might be omitted, as from the point of view of drafts manship it is somewhat inelegant. 'and of Muskat subjects within sub-article ( 2 ), which appear at present in sub-article 5, as local conditions may render it* advis&amp;ble t»o reijciin 'tnein. 10 of the draft it would be usual to insert the words(15635/14). o tv x o \ aware of the reasons why these words have been omitted in the present case and I am accordingly to enquire whether Lord Crewe has any objection to their insertion j f sir E.Grey would he glad to he furnished with His Lordship’s observations on the points raised in this letter before taking any further action in regard to the submission of the draft order to His Majesty in Council.

Sir:- ^ ^ • In reply to your letter of the 6 th. of January, P.4467 regarding the revision of the .uscat Order in Council 1867, I am directed by Secretary Sir ddward Grey to request that you will inform the Larquess of Crewe that he concurs en tirely in His Lordship's opinion regarding all the point raisea ed in the letter from the Government of India dated 16th. October under subheads (a) to (f). Sir £. Grey agrees also with Lord Crewe as regards the provision for jurisdiction over foreigners. He is there fore of opinion that the order may be approved. I am to add that he infers that His Lordship will cause suen work of revision as may be necessary to be done in his Department and will arrange for the submission of the Order to His Majesty in Council in the usual way I ajn,(^*£r &gt; The Under Secretary of State, India Office,Secret Department.would lend to embnrrnssing demnuds from other quarters. TTe see no reason to recede from this decision and would surest that the employment of the title “ His Majesty ” may° be omitted in the revised Order-in-Council. {e) JBaracfraph 9{7).— T T\\e question whether tho incumbent of the British Agency should be referred to in the revised Order as Political Agent or as Consul, is one which we would prefer to leave to Your Lordship’s decision. Should it be decided to refer to him as Consul, the provisions in Articles 74A and 75 of the draft Order, which relate to the Political Agent, will be super fluous. r (/) We invite attention to the point raised by Sir P. Cox in his “notes” on tho draft Order regarding the necessity for pro viding for tho continuation of tho jurisdiction in Slave Trade cases now exercised by the Political Agent under Article 29 of the Order of 1867 and the Slave Trade Acts of 1873 and 1879. 4. ^ The draft Order contains no provision, such as is embodied in similar Orders-in-Council, in respect of tho exercise of jurisdiction over foreigners—. vide, e.g., Article 5(4) of the “Ottoman Order-in-Council, 1910”, Article 5 ( 4 } of the “ Persian Coast and Islands Order-in-Council, 1907 ”, and Article 5 ( 3 ) of the “ China Order-in-Council, 1904”. Wo would invite Your Lordship’s attention to this omission, and leave it to you to make similar provision in the revised Order if it is considered necessary. 5. Willi these observations, we submit the draft Order-in-Council for Yout^ Lordship’s consideration and should be elad if the further detailed examination and drafting of the Order could be undertaken by His Maiestv’s Government.

I have the honour to address Government on the subject of the Maskat Order in Council 1867 and to suggest the expediency of preparing a revised Order more in conformity with modern enactments of the kind. 2 . The need for some such revision, with a view to simplifying the compli- Mted svstem by which British jurisdiction as at present exercised in the Persian Cuff save rise m mu to a suggestion by His Majesty’s Foreign Office that a Persian Gulf Order in Council should be prepared, providing for the exercise of hfrisdiction in all the territories in which administrative control is vested m the jurisdiction No Resident : for various reasons it was decided Jedlfs' . 9 °.. not to pursue this proposal, but an amend ment to the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council has since been effected StS of Bahrein an ofder in Council has been elaborated after exhaustive discussion and is on the point of issue. . . The nresent iuncture therefore appears a suitable one for moving in the Orders! as suggested in the Foreign Office letter quoted above. 3 . Before dealing with the question of the new Order it may be convenient if I submit a few remarks as to the “^‘'e^fd^reglrdilg the precise circuit.- 1 can trace no correspondence on my records g A, , t the An&lt;do- stances which called for its preparation, but i ^eem p ^ dependence of Frenchf Declaration of 1862 , by speaficully S h *^ j 0 f jurisdiction Maskat, made it necessary to make le g a lf rH e f to th f h e p paratL of the over British subjects in that State, and thus lea to rnc h f 0rde l The general question of Consular ) u ' sd f ‘ ifdkf'and Gulf came under examination soon afterwar SjO exhaustive minute, dated Mr. A.

The recent discussion regarding the draft Bahrein Order in Council has thrown a good deal of light on local requirements in this direction, and that draft, in its final form, may be considered as embodying the latest views of His Majes ty’s Government as to what an order in Council should be. Acting on this assumption, I have ventured to prepare a tentative draft on analogous lines, for a revised Maskat Order in Council, which I submit with much deference in the hope that should Government generally share my view as to the need for revi sion, the draft may serve as a convenient basis for discussion. For facility of reference the sections of the draft have been numbered so as to correspond with the numbering of the sections of the latest draft of the Bahrein Order, which has been followed as closely as possible. 9 In preparing the draft, I have endeavoured to observe the following principles in addition to the points mentioned above : — (1) No extension of our jurisdiction beyond that already enjoyed by us in Maskat, by Treaty and established custom, has been sought. ' (2) Following the provisions of the Bahrein draft, the Resident has been substituted for the Political Agent as the authority, for example, for sanctioning Rules of Procedure [Articles 62 and 69 (1)] and for making Rules and Regulations (Article 78): this step seemed desirable in order to assimilate the provisions of the Maskat draft to those of the Bahrein and the Persian Coast and Islands Orders, and in order to ensure that the Rules and Regulations and Proce dure under the various Orders in Council in the Gulf should coincide as closely as possible, a point on which His Majesty's Government have recently, in the correspondence quoted above, laid considerable stress. (3) 1 he marginally cited Rules and Regulations under the 1867* Order have been incorporated in the draft, as it seems to be desirable to Land Regisration No. i of 1903 , vide Articles fo perpetuate an arrangement (a) and 60 ($). ^ which has been working satisfactorily for the past ten years. A new section 60 (b) has been proposed conferring on the Court dis cretionary power to give practical effect to section 60 (a) by de claring a deed executed contrary to its provisions, to be void. This seems unobjectionable and logical, but the Political Agent, Maskat, in mentioning the desirability of inserting such a clause has suggested to me that an innocent foreigner might be a party to a transfer declared void under this section, and that this might bring down protests from Foreign Consuls or from His Highness. He suggests that this difficulty might be obviated by sending those functionaries copies of these clauses and inviting their attention thereto, at the time of the publication of the Order. I should be inclined myself to doubt whether ignorance of the British Law on the subject in question would constitute a valid excuse for a foreigner, but should it be considered necessary I see no local objection to the adoption of the course suggested by Major Knox. (4) . The Indian Pilgrim Ships Act XIV of 1893 has been inserted as an item in the first Schedule. Provision has been made [Article 76 (2)] for the continuance of Rules and Regulations made under the 1807 Order, which is repealed in the second Schedule, Printed copies of all Rules and Regulations, at present in force in Maskat, are appended. (5) . As in the case of the Bahrein Order provision is made for an appeal from the local Courts to the Court of the Political Resident and no provision is made for appeal to the High Court of Judicature at Bombay. I need not go into the reasons which, in my judg ment, render this change in existing procedure expedient, butIt ^.{7, &lt;1-&lt; 5 5 4.' /^^f)| } would beg reference to paragraph 6 of my letter No. 3134,* dated November 27th, 1910, in which I submitted my views on this subject in connection with the Bahrein Order. The objections urged against provision for appeal to the High Court at Bombay apply, mutatis mutandis to Maskat, and both on these grounds, and for the sake of uniformity with the Bahrein Order, I would commend this portion of the draft for the favourable consideration of Government. I attach a statement, supplied by the Political Agent at Maskat, showing the number of appeals to the High Court at Bombay under the Maskat Order since 1867, ^ rom which it will be seen that litigants have very seldom availed themselves of this doubtful privilege. ( 6 ). The use of the title of “ His Majesty” in reference to the Sultan has been retained in the text, ad referendum, because it is employed in the existing Order in Council (Aitchison’s Vol. XII, p. clxix). The point is one which in any case needs the specific consideration of Gov ernment as in the course of discussion of the draft of the new Commercial Treaty the Sultan has definitely asked that “ His Highness” should be altered tn “ His Majesty” ; and I note, incidentally, that in recent letters to the Sultan in connection with the Arms^ Ware-house negotiations, the French Consul always addresses him as “ Majesty.” On the other hand in all our routine correspondence of the past; in the Declarationf of 1862 ; and in all instruments except the Order + in Council of ,867 the Sultan is always referred to as His Highness; and the position is under- stood to be the same in the case of the Sultan of Zanzibar. No doubt the wording of an Order in Council is primarily a domestic matter rnnrerning the British Government and its subjects alone, but the point being, as I have explained already at issue in connection with the Treaty negotiations now iif temporary abeyance, I trust that the present opportunity will be taken by Government to consider the point and decide which form is to be used. f 7 ) -phe incumbent of the British Agency at Maskat has been referred ^ ' to as “Political Agent” and not “Consul throughout the new draft partly for the sake of uniformity and partly becau ? e case as between himself and British subjects, (whom the Order primarily concerns) our representative derives h.s judical authority directly from the Government of India. o,h„ r „ ?s^nV .&lt; o*' th “ 01 Bahrein or Persian Coast and Islands Order. itiiA ment.

Article /o.—The wording of this Article in the Bahrein Order in Council^ is very wide, and it has been suggested that it might cause difficulty by enabling officers of His Majesty’s Government other than the Political Agent to intervene in matters of which the latter has already taken cognizance. ^ The wording of the corresponding: Article of the China and Corea Orderf in Council, 1904’ (No. 27, vide page 257 ) Volume XXIV, Hertslet’s Commercial Treaties) has therefore been followed. PART II. Nil. PART III. ’It is presumed that under Articles ig and 38 the '.Political Agent will still fenjoy all jurisdiction in Slave Trade cases at present exercisable by him under ! Article 20 of the Order of 1867 and the Slave Trade (East African Cou.ts) Acts 1 1872 and 1879 hide also Appendix D “Instructions to Naval officers, etc I Slave Trade”). H this is not the case, it is suggested that an addition be ma 'l to Article 38 to the following effect:— (4) Nothing in this Order shall prevent the Political Agent from exercising all such jurisdiction in matters arising out of the Slave Trade as s conferred on him under the Slave Trade East African Courts Acts of 1873 and 1879.

PART VII. Article 68. —The Indian Court Fees Act of 1870 is, at present, generally used in Maskat as the basis on which Court Fees are calculated : after the issue of the Order in Council it may be expedient to take steps under this Article, or by King’s Regulations under Article 78 to apply this Act to Maskat. It is, however, desirable that fees should be charged at a uniform rate under the Persian Coast and Islands Order, the Bahrein Order, and the Maskat Order, and it therefore appears unnecessary to take any action in this direction at present. Articles 75 and ^6 .—Are adopted from Articles 65 and 66 of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. Article 78 (d). —The legality of making such rules* under Article 1 of the Order of 1867 was recognised by the issue of rules in connection with the Arms Traffic in 1898 {vide despatch from the Secretary of State for India to Govern, ment of India, No. 19,! dated 31st May 1907, and connected correspondence).

From— The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. In continuation of my letter No. 205, dated January 19th, I have the honour to forward, in original, list prepared hy the Political Agent, Muscat, enumerating the appeals preferred from Muscat to the High Court at Bombay since 1867, which should have formed enclosure 5 to the above letter. Whilst fully bearing out the statement made in paragraph 5 of my letter that litigants have very seldom availed themselves of the right of appeal, the return brings to light the fact, of which I was not previously aware, that the Hieh Court at Bombay has ruled that it has no criminal revisional jurisdiction over the proceedings of His Majesty’s Consul within the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat; that the Order in Council of 1867 gave the High Court of Bombay no appellate jurisdiction over the Court at Muscat, and that therefore Section 15 of the Indian High Courts Act of 1861 did not apply This being so the proposals to establish the Court of the Political Resident as the “ Ch.ef Court ” for Muscat, as in the case of Bahrein, would appear to be even less open to objection than in the case of Bahrein. If this letter, with enclosure, is printed, I beg that I may be favoured with copies.V Enclosure No. 3 . No. 650, dated Bushire, the £3rd February 1913. From—L ieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, T’ 0 _The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department.

(ii) “His Highness ” is used in the Anglo-1 rencti lA v .i(iii) Rejection of the Sultan’s request for use of enhanced title may adversely affect his attitude in regard to the alterations desired by us in the new Treaty. 4. From the wider point of view of international law or comity, I am not in a position to offer an opinion of any weight, but I venture to make the following observations for what they are worth. Webster’s dictionary defines— “ Sultan ” as “ a ruler or sovereign of a Muhammadan State and ' Majesty ” as “the dignity and authority of sovereign power usually applied to the rank and dignity of sovereigns.” Sir Saiyid Faisal has been accorded by us and others the title of “ Sultan”, and by the Declaration of 1862, and elsewhere, we recognize him as a sovereign,* and as such, he is in direct and reciprocal Treaty relations with other Powers! From his point of view, therefore, he seems theoretically entitled to accept as of right from ^ his own subjects the address “Majesty”, and to be logically warranted in asking for that predicate from other Governments. On the other hand, it seems open to Foreign States to accord or withhold the title, according to their individual appreciation of the particular Ruler’s justification for expecting it. 5. Supposing that Sir Saiyid Faisal were to persevere in his request, it would seem that the reasons we should give him for rejecting it (havino* regard to the considerations set forth in paragraph 3 (i) and (ii) supra) must be based mainly on the ground that the international dignity of himself or his State did not in our opinion call for it. From this point of view the Sultan would appear to be technically in a stronger position than His Majesty the Amir of Afghanistan. 6. The above arguments for and against, which I have only set out with great diffidence as such, bring me to the personal conclusion that the question submitted requires consideration from the point of view of expediency pure and simple, and I incline to the opinion that if we are not on strong grounds to combat the Sultan’s request,—if persevered with on international thesis,— without resorting to the argument referable to the comparative dignity of himseif and his State, at the risk of prejudice to our practical interests, it would be better to accord a gracious response to his request and make what local capital w e can in the process. I I commend the question to the wise consideration of Government.u «l irdiiiff m for i iS iiirof ilS,- yof te.it teiiAFfri ORDER IN COUNCIL 'P' 3 - At the Court at the day of 'P' 3 - Present.

In cases of murder or culpable homicide, if either the death or the crimin al act which wholly or partly caused the death happened in Maskat, a Court acting under this Order shall have the like juris diction over any person to whom this Order applies who is charged either as a principal offender or as an abettor as if both such criminal act and the death had happened in Maskat. (2) . In the case of any offence committed on the high seas or within the Admiralty jurisdiction by any person who at the time of committing such offence was on board a British ship, or by any British subject on board a'-foreign ship to which he did not belong, the Court shall, subject to the pro visions of this Order, have jurisdiction over such person as if the offence had been committed within its jurisdiction.

Where the subject-matter is not capable of valuation, the fees are to be levied according to the last column. In exec/ution proceedings process-fees shall be levied according to the value of the subject-matter in respect of which execution is sought or where the subject-matter is not capable of valuation according to the last column. In miscellaneous proceedings under the Civil Procedure Code(other than execution proceedings) and proceedings under other Acts, the fees to be levied shall be in accordance with the market-value of the subject-matter when it is ascertainable, and when it is not ascertainable according to the last column. (a) The percentage or poundage leviable under head V of the Table shall be calculated on multiples of Rs.25(i,e,a poundage fee of 8 annas should be levied for every Rs»25 or part oi Rs»25 realised by the scale jtp to Rs.1000 and in the case of the proceeds of the sale exceeding Rs.1000 an additional f fee of 4 annas for every Rs,25 or part thereof, should be levied). (b) In cases in which several properties are sold in satisfaction of' one decree,only onejpoundage fee, calculated on the gross sale proceeds, shall be levied, 2 per cent, being charged on the gross proceeds up to Rs.1000 and 1 per cent on such proceeds exceeding Rs.1000. (c) The percentage or poundage must be paid (l) in a case where the purchaser is a person other than the decree.holder, at the time of making the application for payment of the proceeds of sale by the Court, and ( 2 )in a case where the decree^holder has bean permitted to purchase,at the time of thepreaentation of his application for permission to set off the purchase-money against the amount of his decree. Where a summons or notice to a defendant or respondent is to be served by post registered for acknowledgment, the process fee levied shall km in no case be less than the actual amount required for registration and postage. With the sanction of the Court anl| party may pay the cost of tits proceeding by railway or any public conveyance where such is available, and in such case the process-server shall be bound to proceed by such railway or public conveyance. For process applied for and ordered to be executed as emergent, the fee will be-“ordinary fee and half as much again. Where one individual is to be served in more than one capacity, e.g., personally and also as guardian of a minor or minors only one fee is to be charged. When a process issued by a Civil Court is returned unserved and has to be re-issued for service, a half fee only shall be charged on the occasion of each re-issue. J v This rule applies whatever may be the reason which prevented serrice(e.g., whether the failure to aserve was due to the fault of the party on whose behalf it was issued or not), and whether the identical paper is re-issued or a fresh paper. When the service is set aside in an enquiry under Order V, rule 19, Civil Procedure Code, or when witnesses etc., have to be summoned a second time in consequence of the Court not sitting or not taking up or not completing the hearing of the case on the day on which they were first summoned no further fee is to be levied upon re-issue. Tf a warrant has already been issued to arrest a judgment-debtor who has failed to pay the decretal amount and who has been ordered to be imprisoned in a Civil Jail and such warrant of arrest is in force, no further fee is leviable on the order of coirmittal to jail. No fee is to be charged for any process issued by a Court of its own motion. ) MAS&gt;UT AWAY Wlllt JTl S a* Minute Paper. Register No. ISkf- SECRET. POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. Dated / mb- Ree. Date.

Of those pending all but five are against Arabs living in the coast towns or the interior, and the settlement of such cases speedily is a sheer impossibility. The Local Government has instituted a regular civil and criminal court under the presidency of Sheikh Zubeir, who is also judicials minister, ’who is hardworking and who has given universal satisfaction. The Local Government has also instituted a Ma]liss-al-Tujjar or bench of merchants consisting of Arab subjects which meets once a week and to whom are referred the complicated commercial cases. This bench has also worked satisfactorily. A very large amount of the time of the Consular Dragoman, in fact an un reasonable amount of time is still taken up by his duties in watching the cases of British subjects in the local courts. It has been absolutely necessary to employ an Arabic clerk for the large amount of copying work that has to be done, and I have been compelled to pay for him from the office grant. It is most sincerely to be hoped that such a clerk will be provided for on the estab lishment in the future. For fifteen months I have urged this step being taken. The volume of work caused by the Political events of the last year has been very large indeed, and the time of the Political Agent and his staff such as it is has been occupied almost exclusively in these far more important matters. A comparison with previous years, however, shows that the average of cases disposed of has been been maintained. The cases that are pending as has been explained above are unavoidable* Were the Political Agent able to tour, or rather had he the means to do so, it is more than probable that many of these outlying cases would be settled expeditiously. The amount of fees recovered was Us. 278. As far as possible cases are settled without litigation under Article 10 of the Order and as pre viously reported a considerable amount of the time of the Court is taken up with cases which do not appear in the above lists. Eight hundred and seventy two petitions in connection with legal cases were received during the year. f</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00013e_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/423</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00013e</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/423</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 4487/1913 'Orders in Council: Muscat 1915'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1913/1930</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-05-05T11:21:36</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (237 folios)</extent><extent>Papers are arranged in rough chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.
