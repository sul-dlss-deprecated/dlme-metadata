In the opinion of the President of Supreme Religious Council in S^ypt difficultiedin Hedjaz mi^ht 'be set solved 'by placing Holy Places and the surrounding: Territory under a n-overnor subordinate to a Council Representative of Modem countries. He has sounded British Representative confidentially as to the likely viev^ such a proposal would meet with in India. It is proposed to inform British Representative that His Majesty's Government consider that it is undesirable that they should act as intermediaries in this matter between Moslem Leaders in various countries and would prefer not to depart from complete neutrality. I am concurring in this proposal . But rather than limit themselves to purely negative attitude I am inclined to think that His Majesty's Government mi^ht with advantage also jcrive as occasion offers some public indication of /rood- will and readiness to help if desired. A tentative surest ion is beinr considered by me that this mi^ht be formulated somewhat as follows :- 'H.M's Govt, have publicly announced that as regards future Moslem Holy Places in Hedjaz their attitude is one of complete neutrality. They have no political designs or ambitions in the matter and reco/rnise that persons most concerned are residents of Arabia itself while Moslem of other countries are affected by any disturbance of customs of pil^rima^e. But in the interests of millions of adherents of Islam who are citizens of the Empire and of peace of neighbouring areas for which Great Britain has responsibility imposed by a mandate of League of nations H.M's Govt, would welcome an effe and durable settlement.

Several caravans have been robbed and the people cexposing them have had to return, these robberies seea to have been instigated, or at leant allowed, by the Sharif Muhsin, who acts aa intermediary between the Heja* Oovemaent and the tribes. One of the obj acts seems to have been to aecure the letters in which the people of Mecca have poured out their treasonable #oul» to ihe Wahabie; another, to reward tribes who have promised to help Ali again at the Wahabi®. The Mecca road being closed the population are etelting x other way© of eacape. Egypt md Eritrea refuse to take refugeee &gt; but many have gone to 8uakin. Some hundred® of(4). of moman, eUildran mA -arvants have ba«n cent to ths JeMab qxiarantln* lalands, and all the dhows bare been x«tainod by th« aanfoXk of Utoase p&lt;»opl« to take them to the islands at a KOMBt's rjotloe if Jadiah Is attacked. 5. The d«pa*turs of all the Indian pilgrim , and also the tmUing of ths road, «hioh reao*«g th« possibility {already greatly diminisned by the rsaaauring attitude of the Wahabis) of our being flooded by Indiana from Uaaa*, simplifiae tbe svaouation problem very greatly. The apsoial umaoure® whiah had been taken at Kaaaran by the Resident at Adas to provide for the possible arrival of a,500 British r#fugees aava been cvioelie-,, ;-he quarantine etatioa being able to provide expansion for ^twe 500 persone: that i» about as many as we should have to send there. 6. The fahabia have oomnitted no offences against life or property in Meooa, but they have prohibiten a« unneoaaaary the delivery of taeologioal leoturee and the use of all religioue books other than the Quran and the Traditione. This policy has had the effect of driving a conniderabls number of Malay and JaVaPses theological students away to Jaddah where they are waiting for steamers to call to sake tlMa# Evidanos obtained from these s'udants and from other ouroea goes to -how that the Wafaabia have also desecratsd vtirious tombs at Uaoua which ths Sunni r&lt;^ards with veneration. 7. The Amir All has stated to various people that when Bin Saud rsaohea Mecca he will go there - alone if naceasary - and try to come to an arrangement with him, but that ha will make no further attempt to negotiate with Khalid, It is unlikely that any attack will be made on Jeddah before Bin Saud arrives. The Wahabis have met with no serious opposition hitherto, arid will hardly attack(6). ul attack an fBlSEHflMNl position if they can solve |fc4 problm in other way. Jeddah in mout convenient port for M^cca, but it la not the only port. Trade, if AOt the pilgrim traffic, could b# diverted to e»g, Ra^igh to the north or Lith to th« oulh* Rabigh hat gona ovsr to the Wahabie, ar.d there are sign® that an attempt will fee made to get upplie^ for Meooa through that pl&amp;oe.

At present they are bu^y awearing allegi'mce to both . idm* They will probably 'not maJce up their minde until the ■oalea have mmg definitely one way or the other.

SuppliesENCLOSURE A, t i Translation of a lettsx from the @x~King Hussein to the Acting Prim® Minister of the Hejaz^ I haw noted Your Exoellenoy's telepuonio oomumnioation No.4 of 5.3.1343 (October 6th,1934) addressed to the Qai^waciaffi of the Royal Palace e&amp;hodyl&amp;g the information that the represent at ives of the people of Jeddah are desirous of «y retirement from the administration. I have always from the time of the 'Arab revolt expressed my complete willingness to abdicate whenever the people should desire it or it should appear necessary and all know this to be the case. My wishes and aims are limited to what is necessary for the public welfare, happiness and complete inddpendeno®• The actual leadership is of small importance to me provided these ends be attained. Now they have appointed my son All on condition that the affairs and influence of the Heja» Government be restricted to its own territory and that a constitutional form of government be adopted, notwithstanding that the Arab revolt was based, firstly, on the principle of the complete independence of all Arab countries whose boundaries were defined and, secondly, on the desire to put into force in these sacred lands the laws of the Quran and the traditions of the prophet. To any limitation of the Heja^ I make the following objections# At the present moment the Hejaa is still in negotiations for the independence of Arabs in their countries. Moreover tven without the limitation it can be seen what dangers abound: as witness Bin Saud's ambi i ion in occupying Hail, the capital of the Am irate of Bin Rashid, and Jauf, the country of the ShaUan family, and his attempt to seise Koweit, his attack on Asir the princedom of Al A * idh — not to mention his attack(3). 72- attack on th* sacred oity of Meooa; the attempt of th© Imam of San 1 a to ael&amp;a tha territory of Ha 1 id and Ta&amp;aPia belonging to the ShafaUs; the (attack of the) Idrissl on Hodeida and its vicinity and hie (eic) institution of a constitutional government whereby the precepts of the Quran and the traditions of the prophet are set at nought even in the holy plaoee and replaced by a secular code* I contend that this restriction of influence is contrary to the laws of Islaas, the precepts of religion and the illustrious traditions both material and moral. Moreover it is contrary to the principles of our revolt in which the Hejaa in particular and the Arab® in general poured out their blood and treasure in their effort to attain these two honourable and sacred ends. You are therefore requested to convey to the above committee and everyone elee whom it may concern my strong protest, firstly^ against the limitation of the influence of the Hejaz ae explained above, for it will assuredly result in the Arabs being divided and deprived of their vital and fundamental righte; secondly, against what ia contrary to the rules of the Quran. I hereby reserve my righte of opposition and disavowal both material and moral in everything concerning this question. 15,3&gt;1343. (Signed) Hussein. 14.10.1934.

In reply to Your Majesty's telegrara No. Ill,a summary of which I duly communicated to His Majesty's Government, I am instructed by His Majesty's Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to convey to Your Majesty the following reply: His Majesty's Government have never wavered from their policy of assisting in every possible way to promote peace and good fellowship amongst the various rulers of Arabia. At the same time they adhere to their traditional policy of non-interference in religious matters and do not propose to be entangled in any struggle for the holy places of Islam which may be entered upon by the independent rulers of Arabia. Should such a struggle take place they intend to confine their efforts to an attempt to safeguard so far as this is practicable such of His Majesty's Moslem subjects and of the Moslems under his protection as may be in the Hejaz. Only in the event of both contending parties spontaneously asking for the good officers of His Majesty's Government to assist them to settle their differences by peaceful arrangement would His Majesty's Government be prepared to undertake such a task. They attempted it last winter at Koweit Conference but in vain, the failure being largely due to Your Majesty's delay in agreeing to send a repre sentative. This is the end of the message which I have to convey to your Majesty. Compliments.His Majesty King Hussein, Mecca, To British Agent, Jeddah. No. 125. 1. 3. 1343 ( 30 . 9. 1924) I have received with great delimit your telegram, in reply to my telegram No. Ill, conveying a message from His Majesty's Government. The policy set forth therein shows the perfect wisdom and sagacity of His Majesty's Government in regard to the Arabs and to their rulers. I appreciate that noble policy, and have been aware of it since the beginning &lt;Sf our allijfance, nevertheless nothing, in my opinion, can prevent my raising the question referred to in my telegram, since I stood with them with my whole existence on the field of battle ishile those rulers were living in the enjoyment of their own pleasure. Secondly, His Majesty's Government have repeatedly advised me not to interfere with those Amirs in any way whatsaeerer (you will find copies of those reiterated instructions in your files), and I have followed that advice until the present day. Thirdly, Article 4 of the treaty which Naji al Asil brought says that I am to be with His Excellency Bin Saud in the state which existed before the Arab revolt. These considerations justify the wish I expressed to His Majesty 's Government. As to the Koweit Conference, the attribution of the blame to me is part of my bad luck and misfortune in the eyes of Great Britain. When the High Commissioner for Palestine invited me, I at once gave His Excellency a telegram to my son Zaid appointing him as my representativerepresentative at that Conference. The causes of its failure are well known to the people and officials of Iraq and especially to its chief (? to the President of the Conference) and (? the reason was) his (sic) refusal to accept the Nejd representative. I therefore beg you to coarnunicate this statement to His Majesty's Government in confirmation of my previous telegram. Respects.lele^ran H.

Committee is emphatically of opinion that in no case can British o other non-Kuslim intervention in the sanctuary of Islam be tolerated by Muslims of India and of -the world. 1 interest of British Indian Muslims in Hejaz nor safet Pilgrim routes can equal supreme importance of keeping Holy Land of islam free from non-Muslim interference in any shape or under any pretext.

Telegram from Shaukat Ali, President, Khilafat Committee Delhi, to the Prime Miniator, London, dated 4th October My Committee, has passed following Resolution and desires me oommunioate it to you. Begins. Working Committee of Central Khilafat Committee has driven its most careful consideration to fratricidal struwle now sroinsr on in Hejaz and•to statement of British Premier in Par liament with regard to British intervention. Committee is emphatically of opinion that in no case can British or other non-Muslim, intervention in the sanctuary of Islam be tolerated by Muslims of India and of the world. |Io interest 01 British Indian Muslims in Hejaz nor safety of pilgrim routes can equal supreme importance of keeping Holy Land of Islam free from non-Muslim interference in any shape or under any pretext. Committee considers it to be its plain duty today to tell all whom it may concern Muslims of India as of other places will to a mando whatever lies in their power to prevent non-Muslim interference in affairs of Kejaz. Committee desires that it should be clearly understood that the ri^ht and tne duty to intervene therein cannot be shared with any non-Muslim, and any attempt to do so is bound to be regarded by Muslim world as an act of hostility towards Islam. Committee therefore warns British Government to desist from anything having remotest semblance of such an attempt. Ends. TelegramTelegram from Mshomed Hajeebhoy, President,' Bombay Muslim League, to the Prime Hinifeter, London, dated 9th October 1924. The Committee ox Bombay Presidency Muelim League believe that any non-Muslim intervention British or non-British in Hejaz is calculated to embitter and enrage feelings of Mussalmans throughout India.

Forwarded to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi, with the compliments of His Britannic MaLtv's A^ent and Consul Jeddah. j a Letter from His Britannic Majesty's Agent and Consul, Jeddah, to His Britannic Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 116—(3 i 3), dated the 11th December 1924 (Secret). I have the honour to enclose a report on the situation coverine the neriod November 20th to December 11th. 2. Copies of this despatch and of its enclosure are being sent to India, Egypt, Khartoum (through Port Sudan), Jerusalem, Baghdad, Beirut (for Damascus), Aden, Singapore, Bushire, Koweit and Bahrein. Report for the period November 20th — December 11th, 1924. 1. The Indian newspaper, the Muslim Outlook, has cited the use of the term ' Wahabis' by the English press as an attempt to prejudice the Moslem World against Bin Saud. As several prominent Indian Muham- madan nationalists have used the same term in interview reported in the Muslim Outlook the charge need not be taken seriously. Nevertheless it appears to be true that the followers of Bin Saud object to the name &lt;£ Wahabi and that they call themselves Muslims or Ikhwan (brethren) and claim to be plain Hanbalis, i e., members of one of the four orthodox Sunni sects. The common name for them here is Mudaiyicah. This is apparently a corruption of Mutadaiyinah (singular Mutadaiyin) from tadaiyana=to follow the (true) religion, 2. The proposal to bring down foreign subjects (chiefly Javanese) in caravans under'escort came to nothing, because the Hedjaz Government have no control outside the defences of Jeddah. The Wahabishold the road down to Basrah, the half-way halting-place, but fro n there to the Jeddah defences there are tribes which, while nominally under Hedjaz Government control, would probably rob the caravans; and the Hedjas Government cannot provide an escort of ' regular ' troops. Very few foreigners have reached Jeddah since the date of the last report. They were all Javanese. Some of these maintained that the Wahabis had prevented them from reading Maulide—the various lives of the Prophet by which they and indeed most Moslems set great store. 3. The Wahabis followed up the lesson to the Harb by nearly annihilating two small tribes, the Bani Jabir and the Barakit, within ten or fifteen miles of Jeddah. There seems good evidence that women and children as well as men were killed. Both tribes had sent to Mecca and declared themselves to be ' Mudaiyinah ', but they had doubtless given similar assurances of loyalty to Ali and the ruthless attack was presumably meant as retribution for double dealing. As a warning the fate of these two tribes has been most effective : it is unlikely that the Wababis would have anything to fear from the tribes if they advanced on Jeddah. Ali has lost all faith in the promises of tribal sup port, and moreover he has no money or supplies to give the tribes and without that not even promises are to be had. All Badawin have been sent away from Jeddah. This rids the city of a most disorderly and untrustworthy element and moreover helps to relieve the strain on the water supply.- • ■ Jm'-d ill 'i; ^ Mil 2 The Hedjaz Government are therefore dependent upon the so-called regular army, strengthened—or, at least, increased in number—by several hundred volunteers, most of whom are from the mandated territory of Palestine. The health of these volunteers has been bad ; a very high proportion have been suffering from dysentery or malaria, or both. Many of them still want to get away, but this Agency is acting on a policy approved by His Majesty's Government, of refusing to receive applications for release while doing what can be done unofficially to secure an improvement in cc nditions. Tahain Pasha professes to believe that he could beat off an army of 20,000 Wahabis, but it is doubtful whether he is serious in this contention. People here, who know the Wahabi methods of fighting, say that Khalid would think nothing of sending two or three hundred camelry to death against the barbed wire if he could thereby effect an entry. It is unlikely that the Hedjaz army would stand once the defences were pierced, even if it waited for that. 4. The P. and 0. S. S. ' Nore ' called at Jeddah on November 22nd and landed three aeroplanes from England for the Hedjaz Government. The first to be assembled proved to be a D. H.-9 with a Siddeley-Puma engine—a war plane but not fitted with a machine gun. The second, also a De Havilland, has a Diesel engine: it is a commercial machine fitted with a cabin to carry two passengers besides the pilot and a mechanic. The third is said to be of the same type as the second. None of the machines is new. The only pilot, the Eussian Shirokoff, goes out on a reconnaissance nearly every morning and evening. He always uses the first machine, having smashed the undercarriage of the second on landing after his first flight in it. As he refuses to fly over enemy territory at less than 9,000 or 10,000 feet, and as his observer is a one-eyed officer who always wears dark glasses when he goes up, it is not believed that the reports brought back are of great value. Mr. Shirokoff is constantly being pressed by the Army Commander, Tahain Pasha, to drop bombs on supposed enemy concentrations, but has so far refused. There are no aeroplane bombs in the country. Tahain Pasha wanted Mr. Shirokoff to drop hand grenades, and was with difficulty persuaded that if they didn't blow the machine to pieces they would burst before reaching the ground. He then proposed that shells should be dropped, and himself made an experiment with two, but neither exploded. He is nevertheless pressing that explosives of some kind should be dropped on Mecca, and he and Mr. Shirokoff seem to persuade the King alternately for and against this policy. It is difficult to see what could be grained by the bombing of Mecca by a non-Moslem airman, whereas the drawbacks, from the point of view of the Hedjaz Government, are clear: they could hardly provide Bin Saud and his Moslem World with a better cry. It is possible that Mr. Shirokoff may eventually yield to pressure. He receives from the Hedjaz Government, besides a salary of £60 gold a month, a bottle of whisky a day, and as he supplements this quite inadequate ration by heavy purchases and by drinking at the expense of his admirers, he may one day reach the point of exhilaration at which the prospect of dropping explosives on Mecca will cease to appear objectionable. There are several British airmen in Suez who appear to have been engaged for service in the Hedjaz. They have undertaken not to proceed to Affairs W1 tiie ex P ress permission of the Secretary of State for Foreign The Resident at Aden reports the arrival there, for some unknown consignee in Jeddah, or over a million rounds of small-arms ammunition from England. xi The AT UtIl ? rities were ^ reat fy disappointed that no rifles or bombs arrived on the Nore They have paid about £50,000 to a General Newland, who has a business of some kind in Egypt, to purchase munitions for them in England, and they hoped that at least part of the material would arrive on the 44 Nore Ihey have, however, heard through the Arab Agent in Cairo that His Majesty's Government have refused a license for the export. This they cannot under&gt; stand, as the Hedjaz is a signatory of the Arms Traffic Convention of 1919, but3 they have prohahly not read the articles of the Convention, which prescribe elaborate measures for preventing munitions from falling into the hands of people who have no stable government. 5. Bin Saud arrived at Mecca on Friday, December 5th, and all Jeddah is hoping for a speedy decision of the dispute. The question of the safetv of toreign subjects is, it is hoped, finally settled by the latest letters which have been exchapged between Bin Saud and the consular corps in Jeddah Coniei of these letters are attached. The contention implied, in his letter of November 21st, that having once warned us to remove our nationals either to Mecca or i 0 fTr 6 s P e ^ fied P lace he with impunity kill anyone he found in Jeddah, could not be accepted. His last letter, to which a formal acknowledg ment has been sent, is more reasonable. 3 6 '- lette ^ to tlle . representatives and to Amin iiiham, baiyid Talib Pasha and Mr. Philby, three points emerge clearly — (1) he considers Jeddah essential to Mecca ; (2) he still insists that ' the Sharif ' Ali should leave Jeddah ; (3) he still maintains that the decision must be left to the Moslem World. What is not known is whether he is prepared to try to seize Jeddah by force if Ali refuses to leave the country, and, above all, who in Bin Saud's opinion constitute the Moslem World. It is known that he has been working with the Caliphate Committee in India, and, less openly, with Egyptian extremists, and it is therefore not surprising that he should cling so tenaciously to their policy. So far as is known here, however, the only delegates actually appointed to attend the proposed conference at Mecca are five Indians, of whom His Majestys's Government have found it necessary to state that they are nominees of the Caliphate Committee, and must not be considered as representing Indian Moslem opinion, still less as having any credentials from His Majesty's Govern ment or from the Government of India. Java and Malaya appear to be dis inclined to lake any active part in the decision, and not even the Egyptians have appointed a delegation. It is true that the President of the Syrian Federation has sent a telegram to Bin Saud applauding his policy, but this is generally regarded as a French rather than a Moslem pronouncement, and has moreover been openly attacked by many Syrians. 7. Of the would-be peacemakers assembled in Jeddah the only one who has much chance of seeing Bin Saud at present is Saiyid Talib Pasha. Even he has been told by Bin Saud that he cannot be allowed to intervene in the Nejd-Hedjaz dispute, but he hopes to go to Mecca in a few days, as an old friend of Bin Saud's, ard to have an opportunity to discuss the general situa tion. Amin Rihani and Mr. Philby have both been reminded that as non- Mcs 1 ems they must not interfere in a purely Moslem question. The latest letter to Mr. Philby says that Bin Saud is prepaid to meet him, late% at Bahrah, if he has any purely personal business to discuss; but Mr. Philby is debarred from ^oing to Bahrah, even for that limited purpose, by the instructions from His Majesty's Government, which do not permit him to go into the interior. 8. I understand that the Foreign Secretary here has protested to the Acting French Consul very strongly in regard to the telegram sent to Bin Saud by the President of the Syrian Federation, Subhi Bey Barakat. The Hedjaz Government contend, with some reason, that the telegram could not have been sent without the approval of the French authorities and that it therefore constitutes a serious breach of neutrality by the French. 9. The Egyptian Red Crescent Society has sent a unit to Jeddah. They wished to send one to the Wahabis also and they had some difficulty in understanding that this might not be feasible at present. The Jeddah unit was welcomed by the Hedjaz Government with open arms and given the whole town to choose a place on which to pitch its tents. At the official opening of the hospital King Ali made a very cordial speech—the sort of speech which, if it had been made by the Ruler of the Hedjaz four or five years ago, might have had some effect on the course of events.4 He thanked His Majesty King Fuad, the people of Egypt and the Eed Crescent Society for sending the hospital, and said he hoped that it would mark the beginning of an era of mutual understanding and friendship. 10. A party of about fifteen Japanese, who left Mecca three days after Bin Saud's arrival, have reached Jeddah. The information they bring wa« received while the earlier part of this report was being typed. They state that Bin Saud assembles the IHema every day and that long theological disputes are held. They confirm the stories of interference by the Wahabis in various religious practices and the report that the Wahabis have destroyed the Prophet's house and the tomb of his wife, Khadijah. 11. The ex-King Hussein is still at Akaba, and he still sends frequent telegrams to his son and to various officials, all signed, as though he were still King, by his ' Head of the Hashimite office'. Two telegrams received from him within a few hours of each other a day or two ago give the key to bis character. The Hedjaz S. S. ' Tawil ' ran aground near At aba, and Hussein wired :— (1) Your steamer has sunk. (2) Our steamer has floated off again. R. W.

Following message should he delivered at once to ex-King Husaln. His Majesty's Government have been Informed that HI® Highness the Sultan of Hejd has despatched a force to attack AKABA. They understand that his reason for taking this step Is his conviction that Your Majesty and the Hejaz Government are engaged hoth at MAAH and at AKABA In* activities against him. As Your Majesty Is aware. His Majesty's Government have always regarded the territory of Trans-Jordanla, for itfiioh they are reeponBible under the Mandate of Palestine, as Including MAAN and having access to the sea in the neighbour- -hood of AKABA. When Your Majesty took refuge there they informed King Ali and Emir Abdullah of this and invited them ■ '3. to open negotiations for the delimitation of the frontier between Trans-Jordania and Hejaz It was not, however, / found possible to conduct negotiations in the unsettled state of affairs in Hejaz, and so long as it appeared unlikely that hostilities would extend to the neighbourhood of Trans-Jordania His Majesty's Government were prepared to leave the question for future settlement. Bat matters have now reached a point where His Majesty's Government can no longer permit the present undefined state of affairs to continue. They are acaordlnglyaccordingly taking steps to eetabllah the authority of the Trans-Jordanian Mministration in the area for which they regard themselves as responsible to the League of Kations. This area includes both MAAN and AKABA, and they have no / alternative 'but to invite Your Majesty to leave it before your presence there leads to difficulties between themselves and the Sultan of Hejd. In the event of a Wahhabi attack they may find themselves compelled to insist on your immediate departure and they cannot in any case contemplate your remaining at AKABA for more than three weeks.

Ends. HIGH COlOasSlOHER,Telegram From To Repeated No. 108. Dated 29 ALI has at last recognized that he is beaten. ■ The last straw is the final refusal of Palestine troops to serve any longer without pay; he has had to promise to re- -patriate them to Maan within about three weeks. The other causes are (l) complete lack of money and the probability that Hussein will send no more;(2) the loss of Maan and Akaba, where' -by communication with Medina cut; (3) the fact that several ; thousand pilgrims reached Mecca from oversea; the successful disembarkation of Indians and especially stores at RABIG was a very severe blow; (4) defeat inflicted on Hejaz forces which, emboldened by the withdrawal of the Wahhabis from the immediate neighbourhood, ventured out a few miles. Ali is appealing to His Majesty's Government (my immediately following telegram, sent to foreign Office only) though I have not ceased to keep before him the principle laid down by His Majesty's Government that only on the applic- -ation of both sides could they intervene. Ali may hang on a few weeks (if not attacked) ito through sheer irresolution, but he has lost the illusions which sustained him,and cannot last long . BULLARD. 61/11. ^sr British Agent, Jeddah.
