The subject matter is a dispute between Dr Akopiantz and the Shaikh of Kuwait [Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ]; the former is claiming to have been dismissed without being given his full notice period. It therefore considers whether foreigners subject to the Kuwait Order in Council should be able to sue the ruling Shaikh, and to what extent the Political Agent should act as an arbitrator in such cases.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Arbitration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00015c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
