T have a large accumulation of this leave because I was unable to take it during my last tour of duty in the Gulf, largely because other officers - Rogers for one - were absent on deputation learning Arabic, a facility I was never allowed. Having recent ly spent nearly five years in the Gulf with only two breaks of a month each - on both occasions before the hot weather had really begun - I feel T have a claim to generous treatment in the matter of leave now. I have purposely asked for this leave very early in the season, so that I can be back by the time other officers wish to go. The Oil Company should be away from the Coast by early April; and this place could then well be left without an officer. It is the intention of the Government of India that officers should be encouraged to take this leave. They are regularly taking it in India, and I should be very grateful if you could assist me to do so.

So far as the future is concerned, I merely point out that this devlopment throws fresh responsibilities directly on to this office, and before surrendering the sum of Rs.18,000/- provided in the budget for subsidy to the Aero Club, it is necessary to give attention to the pro blem of the future control of the Flying Clubs. Sd/- Illegible, 9.4.35. H.M. should see. This seems to point to the early demise of the Aero Club. It may also lead to difficulty in continuing the jkil ■ subsidies to the Plying Clubs, as Finance Department will not look sympathetically at a proposal by us for an extra officer whose duties will be comprised larglly in the i %Telegraphic Address—ACCOUNTS.
