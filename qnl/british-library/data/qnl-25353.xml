I am instructed to point out that Tin cannot be considered an urgent necessity of Baghdad and its transport from Busreh to Baghdad at exorbitant rates of freight by native merchants confirms the suspicions my Directors entertain that merchandise is being transported for illegitimate purposes, more especially in view of the fact that the export of Tin to Baghdad from the United Kingdom and Straits Settlement is prohibited except under licence from the War Trade Department.

Q \ p r f 'j \ Sir:- With reference to your letter No.17732/44/7 of the 18th ultimo I am instructed to inform you that we ha,ve received telegraphic advices from our Busreh and Baghdad Agents to the effect that a steam tug and two barges belonging to this Company have been released from Government work for the transport of merchandise between Busreh and Baghdad, and that a maximum rate of freight of Rs.50 upward and Rs.25 down ward per ton has been fixed by the Authorities. Owing to what would appear to be a misunderstanding on the part of the Busreh Officials permission has been granted for vessels hired by native merchants from Persian owners to transport cargo between Busreh and Baghdad at the following rates:- S.L. 'Abe' 18 Tons at Rs.600 or £40 per ton. S.L.'Harmazan'55 Tons at Rs.600 or £40 per ton. S.S.'Nasrat' 140 Tons at Rs.400 or £26 per ton. On our Baghdad Agent protesting against this he was informed that as the Busreh Officials had granted the per mission it would have to stand, but that it would not be allowed after the 1st October. In my letter of the 9th August last, I pointed out that this Company would be prepared to hire any available vessels to carry on the commercial transport and to this ^nd negotiations The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, London. S. f.negotiations were opened with the owner of the 'Nasrat', a steamer formerly employed on the river Karun, but it was found that Mr. Shashoua and his supporters were able, by reason of the exorbitant rate of freight they were permitted to .charge, to offer an excessively high rate for the hire of the vessel. Moreover an arrangement appears to have been entered into by the owners of the ,, Nasrat ,, to carry on the work formerly conducted by that vessel on the Karun by the assistance of the s.w. Steamer ,, Aminiyieh ,, owned by the Anglo*- Persian Oil Company, Limited or that Company^ Agents Messrs* Strick, Scott and Company, Limited* By this arrangement the owner of the'Nasrat' was enabled to secure an enormous profit on the hire of his steamer and to carry on his business on the Karun with the aid of the 'Aminiyieh'* My Directors are unable to believe that His Majesty’s Officials at Busreh are cognisant of the real object of native merchants when granting permission to charge these high freights and strongly suspect that consignees at Baghdad could not afford to pay such enormously high rates of freight, added to the already heavy cost of goods imported at Busreh, unless they possessed some means of disposing the goods by illegitimate means to Alien Enemies at Baghdad. In drawing attention to these proceedings my Directors are actuated by the desire to maintain the prestige of their Company in Mesopotamia., and to put a stop to the unfair speculation in regard to the navigation of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates and with these objects in view they feel justified in asking whether His Majesty’s Government can see their way to issue instructions to the Authorities in Mesopotamia that the commercial transport on the Tigris and Euphrates sha.ll be placed under this Company's control subject to the supervision ofof His Majesty’s Officials until a return to normal conditions. In all the arrangements made by the Controller of Shipping in connection with the requisitioning of steamers during the War the Controller has safeguarded for the respective Owners the trades which they have built up and occupied and they feel sure that His Majesty’s Government will prevent the attempt which is now being made by outsiders to wrest from this Company the position they have held on the Tigris and Euphrates for the last 60 years. His Majesty’s Government are aware of the lengthened and expensive negotiations between the Turkish Government and the Foreign Office before the outbreak of hostilities to which this Company rendered every assistance and the Directors cannot believe that it is with the concurrence of the Foreign Office that they are now to be deprived of their position on the waters of Mesopotamia where they kept the British flag flying for more than half a Century.

We have been informed that none of the Company's vessels can be released at present from Government worA on which they are now employed, but permission has been granted to Mr. Shashoua and other native merchants with no imowledge of the navigation of the river or of the transport business, to run small steamers, which they have hired from Persian owners at iviuhammerah, to carry merchandise between Busreh and Baghdad at freights ranging as high as £20 to £40 per ton. We have request ed the Authorities, in view of the position the Company holds on the rivers, to place all corrmercial transport under our control and we have pointed out that it is manifestly unfair that others should be permitted to intervene at this juncture while our vessels are employed for state purposes.

The contract in approximately its present form dates from 1875, and is based upon one with the B.I.S.N.Co for the carriage of mails to Burma, which contained a similar clause, The original ixttsr rates were Rs.20 and 18 per ton, and when the contract was renewed in 1884 Messrs. Lynch asked for an increase to Rs.35, on the ground that, whereas the lower rate may have been suitable for the B.I. service to Burma, 'it is not at all ve an equivalent or remuneratien rate for small river vessels of the type we employ, which are 17653. I. 1380. 500.—9/1914. much J wmuch more costly in wares and working expenses in proportio to their tonnage than ocean steamers.' An increase of ^ 25 per cent, to Rs.25 and 22i was arreed to. At the renewal of the contract in 1894 the subsidy was reduced from Rs.36,000 to Rs.24,000; and in agreeing to this reduction He ebbs. Lynch stipulated that the rates in clause 15 should be raised to Rs.40 and 38, at’which they still stand. On the whole I think D.A.A.Ch Expy.Force D is right in thinking that the contract dad not contemplate a state of war like the present in which it might be necessary to commandeer the whole fleet for an indefinite length of time, but at the utmost casual military operations. But the G.of I. apparently do not like that view. In negotiating with bessrs. Lynch it ahould be borne in mind that their ships would have been earning little err nothing if we had not commandeered them. (sd) A.Hirtzel 22/4/1515836. I. 756.

Contract with the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, dated 30th March 1905. (Printed on separate sheet.) Enclosure No. 2. Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to India Office. 3, Salter’s Hall Court, Cannon Street, London, E.C., Sir, 15th February 1901. I hare the honour to bring to your notice the fact that the Contract dated 6th of August 1896, and which became operative on the 1st of May 1894, between the Government of India and this Company, for the conveyance of mails between Busreh and Baghdad, will expire on the 30th April of this year; and I am directed by my Board to apply to you for a renewal for a further decennial period. It will be within your recollection that the subsidy was reduced in 1894 from a sum of Rs. 36,000 to a sum of Rs. 24,000, the rupee having, however, materially depreciated within the 10 years. The sum now given is only sufficient to cover the outlay necessitated by the keeping in Busreh of a third steamer, which we are not permitted by the Turkish Government to use, but which must always be in readiness to convey the mails should a breakdown occur to one of the other two steamers. We trust, therefore, that we shall not be asked to consent to a reduction of a subsidy which has already reached a figure that is barely in proportion to the demands made by the Postal Service upon the Company. During the last decennial period the condition of the River Tigris has sensibly deteriorated. Navigation has become much more difficult owing to the volume of the water in the river having become less as further canals, unscientifically cut, have been dug by the Arabs along its banks for irrigation purposes. To meet the congestion of cargo, for the most part British and Indian, which this state of things has brought about, the Company have been obliged to have recourse to the towing of barges, distributing the cargo between the steamer and the barge. This measure has been a great boon to British and Indian manufacturers and merchants, whose cargo would otherwise have been delayed for a very long period. But it has imposed a great strain upon the Company’s staff, and it has been most difficult to keep up a regular service. In the circumstances, we submit that the service of the mails has been efficiently maintained. Although it was provided in our last contract that, having regard to the reduction of the subsidy, the service should be a weekly one, so far as was compatible with the reasonable requirements of the trade, yet we find, in fact, that the weekly connection between the river steamers and the British India steamers has only failed in about 10 cases on an average out of 100. When it is borne in mind that even this small percentage is due to three factors over which our Com pany have no control, namely, extreme lowness of water, inability of the Baghdad Custom House officials to provide a berth for discharging cargo, or quarantine restrictions, we submit that the record is not a discreditable one. During the last half-year, when the river has been better, the steamers have not missed the connection a single time. While asking for a renewal of the subsidy, we feel it our duty to call your attention to the extremely onerous restrictions which are imposed by the Turkish Government upon the activities of our Company. So long as we arc confined to the use of two steamers only, and so longns these steamers are detained in Baghdad for quite uncertain periods, owing to the unsufficiency of the wharf at the Custom House, w r e could not recommend the Government of India to increase the subsidy in order to obtain an accelerated service. Because all that could be gained under present conditions, of heavily-laden steamers and barges, and a low river, would he a possible slight increase of speed during high river when the service is already punctual. Navigation at high speed with very little water in the river would be impracticable. In conclusion, I would venture respectfully to remind you that during the last decennial period this Company has been spending very large sums of money upon tbe development of the Persian trade via the Knrun. More than half of this trade is Indian, and the Indian Government do not at present contribute anything towards the service. The advantages of the service have already been reaped in a practical form by the Government of* India, the material for the new overland telegraph line having been conveyed to its destination in Persia by the Company’s steamers on the Karun, and across the Ahwaz-Isfahan Bead, which has been constructed at the Company’s expense. With reference to the letter from the Government of India, No. 150, Poreign, dated the 21th September 1903, as to the conditions of the renewal of the contract with the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company for the conveyance of mails between Busreh and Bagdad, which terminates on the 30th April next, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Brodrick to request that he may be informed whether Lord Lansdowne has any observations to make upon the enclosed draft* the Contract for a further period of ten years. Mr. Brodrick will also be glad to learn whether Lord Lansdowne thinks it expedient to consult Sir N. O’Conor with regard to approaching the Porte again with a view to obtain permission for Messrs. Lynch to use a third steamer on the Tigris. I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant relative to the question of the renewal of the Contract with the Euphrates and Tigris Company for the conveyance of mails between Busreh and Bagdad. It appears to Lord Lansdowne that the communication which the Secretary of State for India proposes to address to the Company is likely to result in a renewed application from Messrs. Lynch for permission to use a third steamer oa the Tigris. Sir N. O’Conor in his. The Secretary of State for India. I have, &amp;c.. Prank Bottomley, Secretary. Enclosure No. 3.

In reply I am to say that the Secretary of State in Council will he prepared to enter into a new Contract with your Company on the basis of paying the same subsidy that has been paid under the existing contract, viz., Bs. 24,000 per annum, for a weekly service. The Secretary of State in Council is not, however, satisfied that the complaints which have been made of the irregularity of the service maintained by the Company are beyond their power to remedy under the existing conditions of the navigation.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship s Despatch No. Ill, of the 22nd ultimo, asking my views as to the possibility of again approaching the Porte for permission for Messrs. Lynch to use a third steamer on the Tigris. I have carefully considered this subject, and I do not think that anything has occurred which would lead me to alter the views I ventured to express in my Despatch No. 440, of 4th August last. The Russians have approached the Sublime Porte with a view to being granted similar privileges to those enjoyed by Messrs. Lynch, and the Civil List has just placed its new steamers on the Tigris, and proposes to place two more in a short time, so that probably the old argument of congestion of traffic will no longer serve. The existing privilege is envied by more than one Power as well as grudged by the Porte, and I do not see any argument likely to prevail, and obtain a further concession to Messrs. Lynch. Their permission to run tugs was extracted from the Ottoman Government with the greatest difficulty, and -would have been withdrawn shortly afterwards had it not been for the determined opposition of this Embassy.

The result of our interviews has been to amplify in detail and to confirm in principle the statement of the position which we had the honour to submit to you in our letter of the 15th February. We find, for instance, that during the period which has elapsed since the writing of that letter not a single connection has been missed. Any irregularity in the service is caused by factors over which our Company has no control, namely, either extreme lowness of water, or inability of the Baghdad Custom House officials to provide a berth for discharging cargo, or, lastly, quarantine restrictions. Inasmuch as, however, we are anxious to comply as far as possible with the wishes of the Secretary of State in Council, I am directed by my Board to confirm what was stated by our Chairman in the interview kindly granted to him on the 13th instant by Mr. Bichmond Bitchie, C.B., namely, that we accept the new clause to be inserted between Clauses 11 and 12 of the existing Contract. We are quite prepared to rely upon the reasonable use by the Government official of the fresh powers to be conferred upon him. As regards the proposed omission of the words “ So far as is compatible with the reasonable requirements of their trade,” this we submit, if carried out in principle, would quite as much militate against the interests both of the Home and Indian Governments, as it would, prejudice, in a degree quite incommensurate with the subsidy earned, the takings of our Company. It is known to you that a few years ago, after infinite trouble on the part of His Majesty’s Government, permission was obtained by this Company to tow barges. One of the prime objects of this measure was to relieve the congestion of cargo which takes place at Busreh during several months of the year, which months generally coincide with the season of low water and difficult navigation. It would be easy on such occasions to leave the barge behind in order to get up the mails to Baghdad a day earlier ; but such a course would entail the detention in Busreh for another week of all the cargo in the barge amounting to about 200 tons. The congestion would be increased to that extent each time just at the period whe i the greatest efforts are being made by our representatives to get the cargo up the river. There can be no question that if the alternative were placed before the mercantile community of Baghdad, of either receiving their letters a little later, or of having 200 tons of cargo detained in Busreh, they would unanimously adopt the former alternative. The fact should not be overlooked that the hulk of the mails are merchant mails having reference to the cargo which is coming forward. As regards the effect of leaving the barge behind on the takings of the Company, it must be borne in mind that the congestion lasts for such a considerable period that merchants could not be expected to wait until, in the natural course, the cargo had been taken up. They would be obliged to import less. It is true that these merchants, in spite of the knowledge that their cargo will be delayed for several months, do nevertheless continue to ship it to Busreh; they are hand to mouth traders for the most part, depending upon a rapid turnover, and they get advances from the bankers in Manchester directly the goods have left their hands. But of course there is a limit to this system, that is to say, an amount of cargo accumulated, and a period of time for carrying it forward, which cannot be exceeded. When this limit has been reached importation ceases. The loss in this way to our Company would be considerable, and quite out of proportion to the amount of subsidy received. For these reasons, which we have endeavoured to state clearly, though we fear at some length, we are unable to accent the omission of the words in Clause 5, and we would venture to hope that this course may be approved by His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India in Council, dictated as it is, not merely by the consideration of the interests of this Company, but also by the interests of that trade withGreat Britain and India, which we have for so many years laboured to build up. In the concluding paragraph of your letter it is stated that,^ tue “ Secretary of State in Council is not satistied that the eomp.aiuts &lt;&lt; which have been made of the irregularity of the service maintained “ by the Company are beyond their power to remedy, under the existing “ conditions of the navigation.” We submit that the acceptance by us of the new clause between Clauses 11 and 12 ought to secure that such irregularity, if caused by the fault of our representatives, should not be repeated in future. I have, &amp;c., Frank Bottom ley, The Secretary of State for India. Secretary. i &gt; i / Enclosure No. 8. India Office to Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. India Office, Si r? 9th September 1904. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council^ to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th June last, on the subject of the renewal of your Company’s contract for the conveyance of mails between Baghdad and Busreh, in which you state that your Board accept the new clause to be inserted between clauses 11 and 12 ot the existing Contract, but are unable to accept the omission from clause 5 of the words “ so far as is compatible with the reasonable requirements of their trade.” In reply, I. am to say that the Secretary of State in Council fully appreciates the objection of the Company to the complete subordination of their interests as carriers to the absolute punctuality of the mail service. On the other hand, it appears to him that the words in dispute have too wide a scope, qualifying, as they do, the obligation on the Company to maintain a weekly service. Mr. Brodrick notes with satisfaction your statement that the Company are fully prepared to rely upon the reasonable use by the Government officer of the fresh powers bestowed upon him by the new clause. He would therefore propose that the object of the Company should be met by re-drafting clause 5 as follows :—“That the Company shall and will “ maintain a regular line of communication from Busreh to Baghdad “ and back by means of the vessels before-mentioned, and the com- “ munication between the two ports shall be weekly; and in every case “ in which it is desired to delay the departure of the weekly steamer, “ whether on the ground of political disturbances or other circumstances “ over which the Company have no control, or on the ground of the “ reasonable requirements of the Company’s trade, the consent of “ His Majesty’s Consul-General at Baghdad or of His Majesty’s Consul “ at Busreh shall be first obtained.” at Busreh shall be first obtained.' The Secretary, Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. I have, &amp;c., H. Walpole.Enclosure No. 9. The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to India Office. 3, Salter’s Hall Court, Cannon Street, E.C., Sir, 9th November 1904. I have placed your letter of the 9th September before my Directors, and, in reply, I have the honour to set before you their observations as follows :— If the words “ as far as is compatible with the reasonable require- “ ments of their trade, the communication between the two ports shall “ be weekly ” in Clause 5 were omitted, and the draft proposed in your letter under acknowledgment were substituted, there would then no longer, they submit, beany provision in the Contract to meet the case (which is very frequent during the season of low water) where a steamer starts within her appointed time, but is unable to reach her destination in time to enable her punctually to perform her share in the weekly service, owing to the insufficiency of water in the river. This case would probably not be met by the contention on the part of the Com pany that this was a circumstance beyond their control {see new clause), because the Consular Officer might object that they could have per formed the voyage more rapidly had the steamer run empty or with very little cargo, thus enabling her to cross the shallows over which a loaded steamer could not pass. The draft of Clause 5 which you propose does not, it seems to us, provide for such a case. Nor, on the other hand, does it seem practicable to us to leave the decision of the question as to what does and what does not constitute a proper amount of cargo for a vessel to carry during the low season for settlement by the Consular Officer. The captain on each occasion presents a note to the Agent stating the cargo-carrying capacity of his steamer with the existing condition of the river; and he bases his estimate upon some sort of compromise in his own mind between getting up cargo and not unduly delaying his voyage by going aground for long periods upon the shoals. But under your present proposal the Consular Officer might uige that in such circumstances the vessel must run empty, or nearly empty, in order to maintain a weekly service. Owing to the changing conditions of the river, and the limited number of steamers we are allowed to run, we are unable during the low season absolutely to guarantee a weekly service unless we sacridce considerable quantities of cargo, in which case we should require a very much larger subsidy. As a matter of fact, we rarely omit to maintain such a service even at that season, the omissions numbering perhaps five or six during the year. Still we should obviously not be prepared, in view of the uncertainty as to the future condition of the river, and for the reasons above stated, to impose what would be a serious disability upon our steamers in their carrying capacity. Noting your objection that the words in the old clause have too wide a scope, and being most anxious to meet the views of the Secretary of State as far as possible, my Board would venture to suggest that their scope should be defined. This might be done by accepting your draft of Clause 5 with the single addition of the words “ and such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,” at the end of the clause, and amending the new clause between Clauses 11 and 12 to read as follows :— “ That in case any vessel, employed or to be employed in the performance “ of this Contract, shall not arrive at Busreh or Baghdad before the end « 0 f nine hours calculated from the time fixed for the arrival of such “ vessel by the said Government officer, then, and in each and every of “ such cases, and as often as such default shall happen, the Company “ shall forfeit and pay into the Treasury of the Government of India “ in Calcutta or Bombay as and by way of liquidated damages, the sum “ of rupees fifteen for every hour and fraction of an hour after the time 15836. Cmm T “so fixed for such arrival during which the said vessel shall fail to “ arrive, hat, nevertheless, so that the Company shall not in any case “ be liable to any penalties under this clause if the default be proved “ to the satisfaction of the said Government, or of the said Government “ officer, to have arisen from circumstances over which the Company “ or their servants had not and could not have had any control, including “ the state of the river in the low season when the Company shall not he “ called upon punctually to perform the weekly service if such per- “ formance would necessitate their rejecting cargo or omitting to call at “ intermediate ports.” In conclusion, my Board trust that the Secretary of State will recognise that they have done their utmost to meet his wishes in this matter, but that they are unable to tie down their Agents any further in return for the small amount of the present subsidy, and in view of the extremely difficult conditions of their trade. I have, &amp;c., The Secretary of State Frank Bottomley, for India. Secretary. Enclosure No. 10. India Office to Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. India Office, Sir, 14th December 1904.

Political Department, India Office, London, S.W. WHITEHALL, LONDON, S. W. 17th June 1914 1 &amp;&gt;r ; directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter oi the 20th lay do. 199'8 requesting that the Secretary of State for India in Council will contribute a half of a sub sidy of £2,000 a year which Secretary Sir . Grey proposes to pay to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company in 1914 and 1915, and to offer the following observations. The subsidy of 1,600 lor the Hagdad-Basra mail service wnict has been paid to the Company yearly from Indian Revenues, was regarded by the ielby Commission as fairly balancing the subsidy paid by the Imperial srehequer to the Company in respect of its operations on the Karun River ( SAA&amp; paras. 246 and Z56 of the Pinal Report of the Commis sion). Since 1911 this latter sbsidy has lapsed; but the mail subsidy has continued to be paid by Indian Revenues,to which the saving accruing since 1911 to Imperial Revenues has afforded no relief. Lven if the subsidy now proposed were paid wholly by Imperial Revenues the payments made by India and the Imperial Exchequer between 1st January 1911 and Slst Decem ber 1915 would compare thus:- India : 1600 x 5 = £8,000 Koreirpi Office ”2000 x 2 = £4,000 In these circumstances the ! arquees of Crewe would not feel justified in proposing to expend £2,000 in two years as a contribution to Imperial expenditure. On the con trary he considers that a contribution is due from Imoerial to Indian Funds in respect of the relief enjoyed by the The Under Secretary of State, former FOREIGN OFFICE.former during 19H, 191^ and 191S. In this connection I am to invite a reference to the last paragraph of r. Abrahama’ letterfof 5th August 1911, in which the opinion was expressed that in the event of the cessation of the Karun suosiay India should equitably share in the relief arising therefrom, and to suggest for .ir . Urey's favourable consideration that a sum of £2,000 should now be contributed to Indian Funds, representing a moiety of the excess expenditure thrown on Indian bevenues during the years 1911 to 1915.

Grey to offer the following observations for the consideration of the Marquess of Crewe. As Lord Inchcape has agreed to charter the Lynch steamers for a fixed annual payment Sir E. Grey understands that it will make no difference whether Lord Inchcape re ceives the mail subsidy direct, or indirectly through Messrs. Lynch, that is, through the Euphrates and Tigris Company, and as there is thus no inducement for the Ottoman Company to offer a better service, Sir E. Grey concurs in the opinion of Lord Crewe that the renewal of the contract with the Euphrates and Tigris Company is inevitable, and ^ he COPY TO INDIA j 1 | I — J The Under Secretary of State, India Office.(19253/14). he feels that in any case it is preferable that the mails should be carried by steamers flying the British flag. oil B. a-rey agrees that the contract should be renewed J tor live years only. is regards the conveyance of British mails by the Bagdad railway, I am to point out that, in the first place, such a request by His Majesty’s Government would 1 probably entail a similar request by the Gorman Government, 1 tnc, secondly, that the Turkish Government might be unwilling - to meet it in view of the prospective abolition of foreign post offices in Turkey, althou# they might possibly ^ive | their secret assent, as they have done, if His Majesty's Gov- | eminent should wish the mails conveyed by the steamers of the j new Ottoman Company. oir E.

April 1904 will expire on the 30th.April of this year and I am directed by ray Board to apply to you for a renewal for a further decennial period. In making this application I am to add that the service has been carried on with regularity under very adverse circum stances. The conditions of the navigation of the river have in no way improved and the facilities afforded for the discharge and loading of vessels at the Baghdad Custom House have been only slightly improved by the erection of a crane at this Company’s expense. These factors,together with the necessity of the_ 9 _ ^ Company’s steamers towing two barges instead of one to cope with the expanding trade during the last two years entails a much heavier running expenditure to maintain a regular mail service than in former years. My Directors are of opinion that it would only be fair to this Company if this increased expenditure be met with an increase in the annual payment made for the carr iage of mails and I am directed to respectfully request you to give this point your consideration.

I am also to transmit to you here with, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Charge d*Affaires at Constantinople on the same subject. I am to observe that His Majesty's Government, as you are aware, have already agreed, under certain conditions, to the ultimate abolition of British Post Offices in Turkey. In these circumstances, it has been found impossible to induce Hakki Pasha to agree to insert a clause in Lord Inchcape's concession securing to His Lordship the power to carry in the steamers of his company the British mails, should His(40372/13) His Majesty’s Government desire him to do so. It might, however, de feasible to arrange for Lord Inch- cape to have this power by means of a secret exchange of notes with the Turkish Government. The power would only be exercised if the British Government wished Lord Inchcape’s Company to carry the mails instead of Mr. Lynch’s Company; and it would obviously cease if the British Post offices were actually abolished as eventually proposed. It seems to Sir E. Grey prudent to secure if possible an optional right for sending the mails by Lord Inchcape's Com pany even though joint management may eventually be arranged between Lord Inchcape and Mr. Lynch as regards their respective Companies. I am also to enquire whether, in view of the possible danger to navigation owing to irrigation, the Marquess of Crewe considers that it would be prudent to attempt to obtain from the Turkish Govern ment an optional right to send the British mails by rail.

In either contingency it would be desirable to mko provision for the continuance of the British Indian mail service,in thefformer perhaps by an undertalcing to that effect in tlio now Navigation’s Company concession,and in the latter by a separate agreement of a more general character.

Sir E.

In these circumstances Sir E.

In view of possible ultimate dissolution of Turkey and formation meanwhile of foreign spheres of interest, it seems desirable to maintain, and even increase, our establish ments in Mesopotamia, which is region where our stake is most large and our claims greatest. For this reason I submit that no modification should be made in Bagdad and Basra post offices, and that all other institutions which mark our premier position here should be most jealously maintained, such as military detachment and stationnaire. These are ocular proofs of antiquity of our connection with Mesopotamia, where steam navigation and post and telegraph, and nearly all such civilisation as exists, are due to British enterprise.”[29510] Sir G. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 28.) Confidential.) (No. 552. Sir, Constantinople, June 2d, 1913. IN a telegram which I have just received from His Majesty’s consul-general at Bagdad, some observations are put forward in regard to the question of the Mesopotamian river service and of Messrs. Lynch’s Company in regard to questions connected with the Bagdad Railway and the proposal for the establishment of an Anglo-Germano-Turkish company for the navigation of the Mesopotamian rivers. Mr. Lorimer refers in particular to Confidential Print, “ Asiatic Turkey and Arabia,” April 12, Section 7 [16836], and May 7, Section 2 [20977]. He comments at some length on the statement contained in the seventh paragraph of the letter from the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company as printed in the first of the two sections above referred to. In his opinion Mr. Parry’s statement of opinion, viz., that the key of the railroad position, so far as British trade is concerned, is the railroad from Bagdad to the Persian frontier with the extension from Bagdad to the holy places, is a mistaken one. The Bagdad-Basra section, he considers, is likely to be the most important of the whole railway. Arguing on the analogy of the importance of the Samasta-Kurrachee line to the grain-growing districts of the Punjaub, he suggests that the grain grown in Mesopotamia, when once the irrigation works are completed, should form a large and profitable export trade from Basra, since, although the sea journey from Basra is longer than that of Kurrachee, the actual distance which the grain has to cover to reach Basra from Mesopotamia is half or a third of that at present entailed in the journey from the Punjaub to Kurrachee. Mr. Lorimer is aware, of course, of the possibility of the Mesopotamian grain being sent to Europe as cheaply via Alexandretta as via Basra, but does not think this a very probable eventuality, especially if the Suez Canal dues are to be abated. He is convinced that the river service will not survive the opening of the railway, and concludes therefore by urging the importance of His Majesty’s Government securing adequate influence over this Bagdad-Basra section, adding that it is imperative that this section of the work should be pushed on quickly so as to place the Persian Gulf on a footing not inferior to the Mediterranean. With regard to my despatch No. 379^ of the 3rd ultimo (printed in [20977]), Mr. Lorimer states that the Eastern Bank is indirectly connected with the National Bank of Turkey, and that the largest shareholders are the Sassoon connection and financiers in Brussels and Paris. He further suggests that in any arrangement which may be come to regarding river navigation, the carriage of British mails to Bagdad should be secured. He had also heard confidentially that Mr. Lynch was manifesting some anxiety regarding the appearance of some rival in the fusion and monopoly schemes. Mr. Lorimer’s informant was not, however, very definite with regard to the identity of this person. . A mutilated telegram in code from Mr. Lynch reached the representative last week enjoining him not to associate himself with any agitation in Bagdad, but mentioning some protest that was apparently to be made. Mr. Lorimer reports that no such agitation exists there at present, and did not feel in a position to question the representative on the subject. I have, &amp;e.

[20877] No. 1 Section 2. Sir G. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received May 7.) (No. 379.) Sir, Constantinople, May 3, 1913. IN reply to yonr despatch No. 112 of the 17th ultimo, I have the honour to furnish the following information which I have obtained from Mr. E. Whittall, the acting manager of the National Bank of Turkey, concerning the Anglo-Belgian gronp referred to in the letter from the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company of the 11th ultimo. In March 1912 a German gentleman named Wohl called on Mr. Whittall and said that he represented a strong Belgian syndicate (Mr. Whittall could not recall the names of the firms concerned) which was in treaty with the Turkish Minister of Finance for the acquisition of the monopoly of the navigation of the Mesopotamian rivers to be ... ^operation of the Eastern Bank, an Indian financial house which was opened in Bagdad rather more than a year ago,—and he now came to sound Mr. Whittall as a director of the National Bank and as Messrs. Lynch’s representative in Constantinople (as a matter of fact Mr. Whittall had given up this agency). M. Whittall said that he would consult Sir IT. Babington-Smith and Mr. Lynch. As the result of his own further enquiries, Mr. Whittall learnt that, as Herr Wohl had said, the proposal was favourably received by the Ministry of Finance, who had, however, stipulated that in consideration of the monopoly, and of the making over of the fleet of the Idare Nahrie, the Turkish Government should receive 50 per cent, of the share capital in fully paid up shares, and that the remaining capital should be provided 'from neutral states, i.e., not by British, German or French financiers. Mr. Whittall then laid the case before Sir H. Babington Smith and Mr. Lynch, the former of whom declined participation on behalf of the National Bank, while the latter expressed his readiness to join the enterprise but only on condition that the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company should not be absorbed by the new company. Herr Wohl appears to have pushed the matter with considerable activity during the summer and in October again approached Mr. Whittall, who informed him of the replies received from the National Bank and Mr. Lynch, and further suggested that the various permits to run steamers on the Tigris granted to natives by the local authorities (as e.g. y that possessed by Agha Jaffer) seemed to stand in the way of a monopoly. Herr Wohl replied that these permits had not been confirmed by the Porte and could be revoked. All this information is in the possession of Mr. Lynch, and his suggestion that the proposal was instituted by the National Bank is therefore incorrect. (Mr. Parry’s letter of the 13th March, 1913). Mr. Whittall believes that since the outbreak of the Balkan war the matter has not been pursued further here as Herr Wohl has been away for some months. Sir R. Crawford had heard nothing of Herr Wold’s proposals and he believes that the German group is also unaware of them, and cannot therefore have “ thrown cold water on them ” as stated in Mr. Parry’s letter. In view' of the declarations so often made by the Government that the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris is reserved to natives, and to companies formed exclusively of Ottoman shareholders, it is difficult to see how the monopoly, which Herr Wohl desires to obtain can be granted, unless the Government is prepared to submit the question to the Chamber and obtain its assent to it, and as Sir R. Crawford has never been consulted b} the Government in regard to the scheme, 1 am led to think that its practical chances of success are small, and that in considering the present situation we can assume that it has been dropped. It would perhaps, however, be as well to enquire of Messrs. Lynch what grounds they have for believing that the Anglo-Belgian group, [2917 g —2] C I XO iVIAi ib »o ; r 202 the English element in which is apparently represented not by the National Bank bnt by the Eastern Bank, is still continuing its negotiations. (Mr. Parry’s letter of the 11th April). If I have correctly understood Messrs. Lynch’s letter of the 11th instant I gather that their position, vis-a-vis of the Deutsche Bank’s proposal, is that they are quite willing to admit Turkey to a share in the existing Societe de Transports fluviaux—■ which, I may remark, is expressly provided for in the statutes of the company, (see enclosure to Mr. Marling’s despatch No. 675 of the 8th August last) ; but that if it isP proposed to transform this temporary concern into a permanent company, incor porating both the Idare Nahrie and the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, they decline the proposal, although they would be ready to assist in the formation of an Anglo-Germano-Ottoman company possessing exclusive rights of navigation, but always provided that the independent existence of the Euphrates and Tigris Company, with all its rights unimpaired, is preserved. M can quite appreciate the advantages of such an arrangement to Messrs. Lynch, whose real interest in the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, whose business they direct, is not so much in its success as a public carrier as in the facilities which their control over it furnishes to Messrs. Lynch Brothers, general merchants, and they therefore have no intention of consenting to any proposal involving the absorption of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company in any larger concern. But I fail entirely to see what serious attraction the co-operation of Messrs. Lynch without the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company being brought into the scheme, can have either for the Turks or the Germans. Messrs. Lynch admit themselves that the Turks aim at the disappearance of the British flag from the river (to which I could add, what Messrs. Lynch appear to ignore, that the disappearance of Messrs. Lynch’s name would be at least equally gratifying to them’' ; but this is precisely what Messrs. Lynch decline to entertain ; while the Germans would probably view the suggestion as a request for participation without any commensurate consideration being offered in exchange. It therefore seems to me probable that the chances of the formation of a tripartite company on the lines desired by Messrs. Lynch are small, while there is the possibility that Germans and Turks may come to an agreement from which Messrs. Lynch would be excluded and which would result in creating a very serious competition against the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. Two statements in Mr. Parry’s letter of the 11th April seem to call for note, viz., that Messrs. Lynch believe it to be possible to secure Anglo-German co-operation in the Bagdad-Khanikin branch ; and that it would be good policy to give the Germans a share in the river navigation. As to the former, it would be of interest to know why the Bagdad Hail way should be disposed to accept our co-operation on this section. The branch from Sadijeh is not long, not more than eighty miles, and does not run through difficult country, so that it is scarcely our financial assistance that is sought, while on the other hand it would seem probable that the Germans would be particularly anxious to retain control of the door into Persia in their own hands. lire second passage 1 have quoted seems to re\eal a strange misconception on the part of Messrs Lynch as to the actual position, when they talk of “giving a share” in the navigation to the Germans. The introduction of the German interests rests with the Turks, and if they should find it to their advantage to bring that about, we might find it not too easy a matter to prevent it. r J his advacacy of co-c peration with G ermany is, if I am not mistaken, a distinct change of attitude on the part of Mr. lynch. Mr. Parry in his letter of the loth March challenges the statement made to me by Sir P. Crawford as to the inadequacy of the service effected by the Societe de Transports fluviaux ; I would recall that Sir R. Crawford’s account was confirmed by a report from Mr. Consul Crow dated the 25th February, to the effect that the Bagdad Railway Company had been obliged to obtain the services of three steam tugs belonging to Messrs. Wonckhaus (see end of my despatch No. 231 of the 24th March). I have, Ac.

The delays complained of occurred in 1911 and in the first quarter of 1912, and in response to the representations made by Mr. Lorimer to the Company’s local manager, as reported in Chapter VI, paragraph 5, of his Summary for the month of February 1912, there has been a marked improve ment in the delivery of the mails at Baghdad. This improvement was reported in Chapter II, paragraph 4, of Mr. Lorimer’s Summary for July 1912, and it was sufficiently marked to justify Mr. Lorimer in giving the Company a certificate of satisfactory delivery for the half-year ending June 1912. For the present we are of opinion that the representations of the Resident Consul- General have had sufficient effect and no further action is called for. Should cause for complaint again arise, the Resident will, in the first instance, endeavour to remove it in the same way. We consider, however, that, when the contract comes up for renewal in 1914, the question of introducing some more stringent conditions might be discussed.

AENCLOSURES. Enclosure No. 1. Contract with the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, dated 30th March 1905. (Printed on separate sheet.) Enclosure No. 2. Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to India Office. 8, Salter’s Hall Court, Cannon Street, London, E.C., Sir, 15th Eehruary 1901. I hare the honour to bring to your notice the fact that the Contract dated 6th of August 1896, and which became operative on the 1st of May 1894, between the Government of India and this Company, for the conveyance of mails between Busreh and Baghdad, will expire on the 30th April of this year; and I am directed by my Board to apply to you for a renewal for a further decennial period. It will be within your recollection that the subsidy was reduced in 1894 from a sum of Rs. 36,000 to a sum of Rs. 24,000, the rupee having, however, materially depreciated within the 10 years. The sum now given is only sufficient to cover the outlay necessitated by the keeping in Busreh of a third steamer, which we are not permitted by the Turkish Government to use, but which must always be in readiness to convey the mails should a breakdown occur to one of the other two steamers. We trust, therefore, that we shall not be asked to consent to a reduction of a subsidy which has already reached a figure that is barely in proportion to the demands made by the Postal Service upon the Company. During the last decennial period the condition of the River Tigris has sensibly deteriorated. Navigation lias become much more difficult owing to the volume of the water in the river having become less as further canals, unscientifically cut, have been dug by the Arabs along its banks for irrigation purposes. To meet the congestion of cargo, for the most part British and Indian, which this state of things has brought about, the Company have been obliged to have recourse to the towing of barges, distributing the cargo between the steamer and the barge. This measure has been a great boon to British and Indian manufacturers and merchants, whose cargo would otherwise have been delayed for a very long period. But it has imposed a great strain upon the Company’s staff, and it has been most difficult to keep up a regular service. In the circumstances, we submit that the service of the mails has been efficiently maintained. Although it was provided in our last contract that, having regard to the reduction of the subsidy, the service should be a weekly one, so far as was compatible with the reasonable requirements of the trade, yet we find, in fact, that the weekly connection between the river steamers and the British India steamers has only failed in about 10 cases on an average out of 100. When it is borne in mind that even this small percentage is due to three factors over which our Com pany have no control, namely, extreme lowness of water, inability of the Baghdad Custom House officials to provide a berth for discharging cargo, or quarantine restrictions, we submit that the record is not a discreditable one. During the last half-year, when the river has been better, the steamers have not missed the connection a single time. While asking for a renewal of the subsidy, we feel it our duty to call your attention to the extremely onerous restrictions which are imposed by the Turkish Government upon the activities of our Company. So long as we arc confined to the use of two steamers only, and so longas these steamers are detained in Baghdad for quite uncertain periods, owing to the unsufficiency of the wharf at the Custom House, we could not recommend the Government of India to increase the subsidy in order to obtain an accelerated service. Because all that could be gained under present conditions, of heavily-laden steamers and barges, and a low river, would be a possible slight increase of speed during high river when the service is already punctual. Navigation at high speed with very little water in the river would be impracticable. In conclusion, I would venture respectfully to remind you that during the last decennial period this Company has been spending very large sums of money upon the development of the Persian trade via the Karun. More than half of this trade is Indian, and the Indian Government do not at present contribute anything towards the service. The advantages of the service have already been reaped in a practical form by the Government of India, the material for the new overland telegraph line having been conveyed to its destination in Persia by the Company’s steamers on the Karun, and across the Ahwaz-Isfahan Boad, which has been constructed at the Company’s expense.

It appears to Lord Lansdowne that the communication which the Secretary of State for India proposes to address to the Company is likely to result in a renewed application from Messrs. Lynch for permission to use a third steamer on the Tigris. Sir N. O’Conor in his,Despatch No. 440 of the 4th of August last, explained the reasons which he then considered to prevail against supporting such an application, and, in view of the recent establishment of a Turkish steamboat service on the Tigris, it is probable that the Porte would be less disposed than before to favourably consider any representations on the subject. Lord Lansdowne will, however, again refer the question to Sir N. O’Conor for his consideration, and in the meantime he sees no objection to addressing the Euphrates and Tigris Company in the terms which Mr. Secretary Brodrick proposes.

In reply I am to say that the Secretary of State in Council will be prepared to enter into a new Contract with your Company on the basis of paying the same subsidy that has been paid under the existing contract, viz.^Ps. 24,009 per annum, for a weekly service. The Secretary of State in Council is not, however, satisfied that the complaints which have been made of the irregularity of the service maintained by the Company are beyond their power to remedy under the existing conditions of the navigation. He, therefore, considers it necessary to insist upon provisions (a statement of which is enclosed) being introduced into any new Contract, in order to secure greater regularity in the future.

Constantinople, My Lord, 5th April 1904. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship’s Despatch No. Ill, of the 22nd ultimo, asking my views as to the possibility of again approaching the Porte for permission for Messrs. Lynch to use a third steamer on the Tigris. I have carefully considered this subject, and I do not think that anything has occurred which would lead me to alter the views I ventured to express in my Despatch No. 440, of 4th August last. The Eussians have approached the Sublime Porte with a view to being granted similar privileges to those enjoyed by Messrs. Lynch, and the Civil List has just placed its new steamers on the Tigris, and proposes to place two more in a short time, so that probably the old argument of congestion of traffic will no longer serve. The existing privilege is envied by more than one Power as well as grudged by the Porte, and I do not see any argument likely to prevail, and obtain a further concession to Messrs. Lynch. Their permission to run tugs was extracted from the Ottoman Government with the greatest difficulty, and would have been withdrawn shortly afterwards had it not been for the determined opposition of this Embassy. I have, &amp;c., The Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., N. E. O’Conor. &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Enclosure No. 7. Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to India Office. 3, Salter’s Hall Court, Cannon Street, E.C., Si r &gt; 15th June 1904. We have taken advantage of the presence in England, on leave of absence, of our Manager in Baghdad, which was already in con templation when we received your letter of the 25th March, to conferI fu ly ^ith liim upon the conditions of the mail seryice. The result of oui inteiviews has been to amplify in detail and to confirm in principle the statement of the position which we had the honour to submit to you in our letter or the 15th February. TVb find, for instance, that during the period which has elapsed since the writing of that letter not a single connection has been missed. Any irregularity in the service is caused by factors over which our Company has no control, namely, either extreme lowness of water, or inability of the Baghdad Custom House officials to provide a berth for discharging cargo, or, lastly, quarantine restrictions. Inasmuch as, however, we are anxious to comply as far as possible with the wishes of the Secretary of State in Council, I am directed by my .Board to confirm what was stated by our Chairman in the interview kindly granted to him on the 13th instant by Mr. Bichmond Bitchie, C.B., namely, that we accept the new clause to be inserted between Clauses 11 and 12 of the existing Contract. We are quite prepared to rely upon the reasonable use by the Government official of the fresh powers to be conferred upon him. As regards the proposed omission of the words “ So far as is compatible with the reasonable requirements of their trade,” this we submit, if carried out in principle, would quite as much militate against the interests both of the Home and Indian Governments, as it would prejudice, in a degree quite incommensurate with the subsidy earned, the takings of our Company. It is known to you that a few years ago, after infinite trouble on the part of His Majesty’s Government, permission was obtained by this Company to tow barges. One of the prime objects of this measure was to relieve the congestion of cargo which takes place at Busreh during several months of the year, which months generally coincide with the season of low water and difficult navigation. It would be easy on such occasions to leave the barge behind in order to get up the mails to Baghdad a day earlier ; but such a course would entail the detention in Busreh for another week of all the cargo in the barge amounting to about 200 tons. The congestion would be increased to that extent each time just at the period when the greatest efforts are being made by our representatives to get the cargo up the river. There can be no question that if the alternative were placed before the mercantile community of Baghdad, of either receiving their letters a little later, or of having 200 tons of cargo detained in Busreh, they would unanimously adopt the former alternative. The fact should not he overlooked that the bulk of the mails are merchant mails having reference to the cargo which is coming forward. As regards the effect of leaving the barge behind on the takings of the Company, it must be borne in mind that the congestion lasts for such a considerable period that merchants could not he expected to wait until, in the natural course, the cargo had been taken up. They would be obliged to import less. It is true that these merchants, in spite of the knowledge that their cargo will be delayed for several months, do nevertheless continue to ship it to Busreh ; they are hand to mouth traders for the most part, depending upon a rapid turnover, and they get advances from the bankers in Manchester directly the goods have left their hands. But of course there is a limit to this system, that is to say, an amount of cargo accumulated, and a period of time for carrying it forward, which cannot be exceeded. When this limit has been reached importation ceases. The loss in this way to our Company would be considerable, and quite out of proportion to the amount of subsidy received. For these reasons, which we have endeavoured to state clearly, though we fear at some length, we are unable to accent the omission of the words in Clause 5, and we would venture to hope that this course may be approved by His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India in Council, dictated as it is, not merely, by the consideration of the interests of this Company, but also by the interests of that trade with Hz-Great Britain and India, which we have for so many years laboured to build up. In the concluding paragraph of your letter it is stated that, “ the “ Secretary of State in Council is not satisfied that the complaints “ which have been made of the irregularity of the service maintained “ by the Company are beyond their power to rernedy, under the existino- “ conditions of the navigation.” We submit that the acceptance bv us of the new clause between Clauses 11 and 12 ought to secure that such irregularity, if caused by the fault of our representatives, should not be repeated in future. India Office to Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th June last, on the subject o ic renewal of your Company’s contract for the conveyance of mails between Baghdad and Busreh, in which you state that your Board accept the new clause to be inserted between clauses 11 and 12 of the existing Contract, but are unable to accept the omission from clause 5 of thei^trade ” S ° ^ ^ ^ COinpatibIe with tlle reasonable requirements In reply, l am to pay that the Secretary of State in Council fully appreciates the objection of the Company to the complete subordination ot their interests as carriers to the absolute mmetna.litvr nf fho ™aU I have, &amp;c., The Secretary of State for India Frank Bottotmlev, Secretary. Enclosure No. 8. Sir, India Office, 9tb September 1904. at Busreh shall be first obtained. The Secretary, Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. I have, &amp;c., H. Walpole.Enclosure No. 9. The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to India Office. Salter’s Hall Court, Cannon Street, E.C., ^ ir &gt; 9th Novemher 1904. I have placed your letter of the 9th September before my Directors, and, in reply, I have the honour to set before you their observations as follows :— If the words “ as far as is compatible with the reasonable require- “ ments of their trade, the communication between the two ports shall be weekly in Clause 5 were omitted, and the draft proposed in your letter under acknowledgment were substituted, there would then no longer, they submit, be any provision in the Contract to meet the case (which is very frequent during the season of low water) where a steamer starts within her appointed time, but is unable to reach her destination in time to enable her punctually to perform her share in the weekly service, owing to the insufficiency of water in the river. This case would probably not be met by the contention on the part of the Com- pany that this was a circumstance beyond their control {see new clause), because the Consular Officer might object that they could have per formed the voyage more rapidly had the steamer run empty or with very little cargo, thus enabling her to cross the shallows over which a loaded steamer could not pass. The draft of Clause 5 which you propose does not, it seems to us, provide for such a case. Nor, on the other hand, does it seem practicable to us to leave the decision of the question as to what does and what does not constitute a proper amount of cargo for a vessel to carry during the low season for settlement by the Consular Officer. The captain on each occasion presents a note to the Agent stating the cargo-carrying capacity of his steamer with the existing condition of the river; and he bases his estimate upon some sort of compromise in his own mind between getting up cargo and not unduly delaying his voyage by going aground for long periods upon the shoals. lint under your present proposal the Consular Officer might uige that in such circumstances the vessel must run empty, or nearly empty, in order to maintain a weekly service. Owing to the changing conditions of the river, and the limited number of steamers we are allowed to run, we are unable during the low season absolutely to guarantee a weekly service unless we sacrifice considerable quantities of cargo, in which case we should require a very much larger subsidy. As a matter of fact, we rarely omit to maintain such a service even at that season, the omissions numbering perhaps five or six during the year. Still we should obviously not be prepared, in view of the uncertainty as to the future condition of the river, and for the reasons above stated, to impose what would be a serious disability upon our steamers in their carrying capacity. Noting your objection that the words in the old clause have too wide a scope, and being most anxious to meet the views of the Secretary of State as far as possible, my Board would venture to suggest that their scope should be defined. This might be done by accepting your draft of Clause 5 with the single addition of the words “ and such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,” at the end of the clause, and amending the new clause between Clauses 11 and 12 to read as follows :— “ That in case any vessel, employed or to be employed in the performance “ of this Contract, shall not arrive at Busreh or Baghdad before the end “ of nine hours calculated from the time fixed for the arrival of such “ vessel by the said Government officer, then, and in each and every of “ such cases, and as often as such default shall happen, the Company “ shall forfeit and pay into the Treasury of the Government of India “ in Calcutta or Bombay as and by way of liquidated damages, the sum “ of rupees fifteen for every hour and fraction of an hour after the time 1583G. C“ so fixed for such arrival during which the said vessel shall fail to “ arrive, but, nevertheless, so that the Company shall not in any case “ be liable to any penalties under this clause if the default be proved “ to the satisfaction of the said Government, or of the said Government “ officer, to have arisen from circumstances over which the Company “ or their servants had not and could not have had any control, including “ the state of the river in the low season when the Company shall not be “ called upon punctually to perform the iveekly service if such per- “ formance would necessitate their rejecting cargo or omitting to call at “ intermediate ports!' In conclusion, my Board trust that the Secretary of State will recognise that they have dotie their utmost to meet liis wishes in this matter, but that they are unable to tie down their Agents any further in return for the small amount of the present subsidy, and in view of the extremely difficult conditions of their trade.
