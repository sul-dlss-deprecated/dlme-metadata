It also notes that the tenor of the advice said to have been given by Rustam Effendi to the Chiefs of Bahrain appears to confirm that the Pasha has declined to get involved in the island's affairs.The item has one enclosure; a translation of a letter from Hajee Jassem, Agent at Bahrein, to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 20 Feb 1854.In addition to reporting the above information to the Resident, the enclosure concerns the tribute due from the Chief of Bahrein to Ameer Fysul [Amīr Fayṣul], Chief of the Wahabi.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051548.0x00002a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
