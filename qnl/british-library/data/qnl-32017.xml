(3) Rafa’ a (4) 2elag . . . ^5) Bssex I'oint (6) BAPGO G-arden . . . (?) Jufair Naval Base (3) R.A.F. Site ( 9 ) liuhsirraq The following are a few notes on the above sites. . 0) ^udayieli . Situated some 15 miles west of Nanamah-and at the extreme north-west corner of Bahrein Island. It is reacned by a rough track, motorable but unsurfaced. It is the jetty for the convict isle and but for a garden, a few police and a derelict town is desert. The deserted town casts an.atmosphere of desolation on the place and adds to the general gloom of the vicinity. Possibly a suitable piece of land could be found near the sea. It has artesian v/ater but notning else to recommend it to my mind. It has, however, been strongly tipped. I should be the last person to advocate another Sabzabad; that is to say a Residency towniet some distance from the centre of activities. ( 2 ) .ne Portuguese -ort . Is more attractive than (1J and better situated. It is, however, some 7 miles from Nan amah away from the main^. centre of activity and oilfield road. The only site is that occupied by the Port and to develop the site for a Residency would entail its removal. It is doubtful if this could be acaieved - even if it were thought desirable - without arousing local resentment. The site has not enougn to recommend it to warrant further notes. ^3) At Rafa 1 a the Sheikh has his inland dwelling around which a number of buildings have been constructed. From the climatic point of view, the site is good, but j.t would be. impolitic to build so close to the Sheikh’s area and the site need not further be considered. ( 4 ) helag is situated on the mid-western shore of the main Island and is a pleasant spot. It is a long way from the centre of activities though it has a passable approach road belonging to BAPCO. For this reason only it is not suitable as a Residency. (5) Bssex ibint . A plot here was once selected for the new Residency and no doubt a suitable piece of land could be acquired today. It is in the same part of the island as Jufair and the R.A.F. site and suffers from the same drawback in that the north-west wind - the cool wind - has to oass over I'anamah before it reaches Essex Point. .This may not seem any great matter on paper, but if the dirty and congested state of llanamah is known it assumes some proportions at least. It is unavoidable and sites (6), ( 7 ) / andand (d) all suffer to a varying degree in this respect. It is as conveniently situated as regards public services and roads as either BAKJO G-arden, Jufair or the R.A.F. Site but is acquisition vvculd entail purchase which rules it out - certainly at this stage. (6) BAPCO G-arden is closest to Manamah of all the possible sites, but it .is fairly certain that BAFOO do not wish to sell and so it need not be given further thought. (7) This is the present Bahrein Navhl Base (Jufair; and therefore is certainly not available, in its entirety, but a sufficiently large area of the Base compound might be acquired from the Navy, (it has never been explained, to the best of ny knowledge, nor have I seen papers stating which area of the Base the Ministry of /forks would require for the Residency). Vfhether the advantages of a portion of the Base are sufficient to outweigh those of a separate independent available site - the R.A.F. Bite numbered 8 in these notes - and will warrant entering into negotiations with the Admiralty is doubtful. This is especially so when it is remembered that the best area of the Base is already occupied and used by the Navy. The doubt may, however, be expected to a certain degree if the portions of the Base which might be made available are examined and compared with the R.A.F. Site. As regards the R.A.F. Site the following few notes at this stage may be of assistance. It is available in its entirety. It is suitable. . \...» Being 's property no difficulty on the score of cost would presumably arise and in this respect can be treated similarly to the acquisition of a portion of the Base. As regards roads, it is situated on the i.ianamah-Jufair track and about a mile from its terminus at the entrance gate of the Base. The Residency compound could, therefore, be provided with more than one access to the main track. This would be an advantage over the existing cul-de-sac, difficult to describe in a few words but readily understandable by the local occupants. Since the R.A.F. Site is situated on the LIanamah-Jufair track the electric power lines pass close to the site, and it is, -therefore, if anything, better situated in this respect than the Base. An advantage it would have- over the Base is thau a -resh start in wiring could be made. The Base is already wired for the Bahrein Government supply to run the water distillery plant which the Navy have rented to the Bahrein Government and for the Base private current supply. This duplication is complicated and is always giving trouble. Drastic re-wiring and organisation would be required if a Residency compound were to be established in the Base. There is now, I understand, a suggestion afoot that the Residency should be provided with and maintain its own power supply. This would be admirable if only in view of the. bad state of the Bahrein Government supply and equipment. At present, of course, the Bahrein Government have not the current available but it is to be hoped that they will have re-organised that State Department sufficiently by the time a new Residency would call for current. I am not, however, in the least sanguine on that point. The telephone wiring when I left Bahrein was chaotic. The Residency maintains and runs a small button exchange 6 days a week for 12 hours a day but the difficulties of obtaining a connection during these hours have to be experienced to be believed. Fortunately there is a complete black-out on Sundays and after 3 p.m. and before 8 a.m. when relief from futile endeavour is obtained. Both in the Base and in the R.A.F- Site a new telephone system is essential. /Water.‘ 30D - water. The R.A.i 1 . Site is situated aver the artesian zone, at least so I presume from the fact that all round the site are artesian wells. Whether there actually is a well on the site I do not know, hut from local though non-technical knowledge there is no reason to suppose that ample v/ater is not available, wells would have to be dug, but the same applies if an area of the Base were occupied for there the existing water supplies are quite inadequate for ever present needs. An illustration of this is tnat the Ward-roomavimming-bath takes 2 days to fill when supplies to gardens are cut off. After a further 2 days the bath is the colour of a village pond. ’he present value of this amenity pan be easily estimated, though it is true some people dive into the pea-soup and indeed on a very not day it is difficult not to. hew wells are required whether an area of the Base or the R.A.F. Site is finally selected. There are no other public services I can call to mind. There is no drainage system in lianamah and the new piped-water supply would not extend to either site. There are no made , roads on the R.A.F. Site though .it is traversed by beaten tracks. This might be considered an advantage over the Base where existing roads would have to be dug up and re—made elsewhere. xhere is little to choose between the two. If anything the air at the m.. Site might oe a little drier than at the Base. Since the Residency is to oe air—condioioned this point is not wortn pursuing. As regards outlook or view any portion of the north corner of the Base has aa uninterrupted view o^ trie i\.ner Idiadiyan. From the R.A.F. site the. mud—roofs of Kan amah can be seen as well as the sea. Anyone new to the G-ulf will almost certainly prefer the former, and an older ,iand the. latter. Here again air—conui^ioning aiiects tne situation for it provides the very great boon of being able to sit and live in a house in the normal fashion as agamot cnasing or avoiding the wind or perpetually changing rooms in search of a breeze. .proximity oo the sea is an advantage then the north corner of the wase is preferable to tne R.F. 3ise. The former has sea on two sides and tne latter on one. There is, however, nothing in this for, in ny view, the mud flats at low tide more than counterrb^l^nce the attractiveness of the high tides. Tne j.L.A.f • jiue is, j. oelieve, aoout the size required. I have never seen a plan of it. • To return to the consideration of the Base, this can conveniently be roughly in^o 3 areas, -xrea a, tne north east corner ^and undoubtedly the ■ n best* area of the Base) would consist of the officers' garden and tennis court, the officers' swimming pool, the ward-room in which are the R.N. Intelligence Officer's quarters and those of h^s clerk, the squash court, the S.iwj.'s bungalow in whicn the Resident is lodged at present, the sick bay and above the captain’s quarters. There are roads, gardens and waste*pieces of land joining all this together with the cricket ground. The cinema' and theatre might also come into it. Bo that tnese buildings, etc. snail not be just so many words or marks on a plan the foilowing.explanatory remarks may be of use. It is necessary to have a fairly accurate idea in order to be able to judge what the Admiralty may be asked to give up. xne officers' garden is a large pleasant date-grove in which, at the western boundary, the tennis court is situated. The ward-room, swimming bath, squash court and their gardens are at the eastern end of the main garden and ^ne whole forms the Officers' chief amenity. All are permanent structures, ine 3.1..0, s house is merely a barrack partitioned off into rooms and with tv/o oays and a verandah added. It is a temporary structure and ouite unsuited for a Residency even with major alterations. fhe sick oays are *our plain rooms and an oddment room together with one sink to serve as bathroom. The captain's quarters are above where, strange tosay, the four rooms are not too Toad. But then there’s a bathroom.' The building is a permanent structure but quite unsuitable for a house even if knocked about. The top floor, as bachelor quarters, is passable. The cricket ground is a cleared and rolled piece of foreshore and of no consequence when considered in terms of amove. The above area is quite clearly the best area of the best but whether the Admiralty would be prepared to part with it and re-build elsewhere in the Base and whether would be prepared to foot the bill for such additional expenditure can only be answered by those bodies. If they do, at best, all they will achieve is a piecemeal arrangement of odd buildings, not, I should say, to be recommended. Portion (Y) is difficult to describe from memory and without the aid of a plan. I roughly picture if as a square of land lying to the south of the Base main-road from about the cinema building in the east to the guard room in the west. In this area would lie some sports fields but I think no permanent buildings. Negotiations for the abandonment of the fields would be likely to prove unsuccessful unless ample space were available elsewhere. However, that may not be necessary and in ary case I believe that the Ilinistry of .Yorks representative (Mr. Turner) selected a site in portion (Y) when presumably consideration to the matter was given. Portion (Z) -is the southern area and is mainly in use. Canteen, stores, etc. etc. are in that area and in other respects too I think it would not be suitable. ..... Site (8) R.A.IV Site. Sufficient has been said under (?) the Base on this site but a few words to describe its situation may not be out of place. It is in the , 'Belgravia ,, (nothing to do with the .adviser!) of Manamah, tha.t is to say it is near the Sheikh's Manamah Residence and the dwellings of other members of the A1 Khaliyah. .The area is, therefore, not quite so covered with the mess of date-frond hutments as is to be found at say, Essex Point. There are, of course, plenty of huts in the vicinity but the area is a little tidier. For the rest, if is a flat piece of desert on which nothing is growing, but judging from the A.L.O.*s house and the A.P.A.'s house both in the vicinity within a year of planting and watering it should be green and pleas ant• ( 9 ) There is no suitable site in l.luharraq I can call-to mind. The choice, therefore, lies between (A) or (Y) of the Base or the R.A.P. Site and from the above notes it will be seen that I consider the R.A.F. Site preferable to either of the other two. To summarise ray reasons. It is available and, to ny way of thinking, preferable in that its situation is open as against being tucked away in a corner as a low lying promontary. I believe that in i:he long run a Residency quite separate from the Navy and its organisation would be in the best interests of both Services and that temporary considerations of convenience should not over-ride this long term view. There would, of course, remain the closest co-operation, but I feel that a Residency compound within the Base would lead to many local differences and jealousies. The Ministry of Works would, I suppose, have to cope with the water, drains, lights and v/iring problems but we should have to face social and operational differences of opinion which, with the best will in the v/orld, would surely arise. These are the chief factors which affect the situation since in respect of the considerations which have been outlined above, I consider that there is but little to choose between the three sites and may I, therefore, say that I believe that the sooner the R.A.F. Site is taken over and work started the better. - I have not mentioned the health aspect. This is for the reason that there is very little to choose, in ray opinion, between iissex Point, BaPGu barden, /JufairJufair (X) and the R.^.P. Site. In flies and mosquitoes, Essex Point and BAPCO Garden probably excel in numbers while Jufair (X) will be freer than the R.A.P. Site. If health and communications are to be ruling factors then none of the above sites should be chosen but a plot of land in the vicinity of the awali-Ali road junction. This would make an excellent site for the following reasons. It is out of the 'wet blanket™ atmosphere of llanamah and this says a lot. It gets much drier and cooler at this point. It is very centrally situated from Manamah, Awali, the Sheikh, the agency, Jufair and Sitra. It is on the main road and consequently telephone connections should not present a difficulty. A self-contained electricity plant v/ould be required, but something of the sort has, I believe, already been considered for a Manamah site. Jater would want conveying to the site and would have to be pumped some 2 miles from the date-garden and artesian zone. The desert which the area now is could almost certainly be cultivated to the same extent as Awali (EAPCO camp) that is to say lawns, flowers, trees and hedges, etc. could be grown.Dear Sir Rupert, I have ®nly just received Walter’s Repart and Minutes •f the Meeting held at Bahrain 25th Octsber - which appears t® have been delayed in the p^st. Regarding the revised and alternative area ©f site pr®p©sed at this Meeting, it is difficult t® say haw we can devel®p this area without details ©f a schedule ©f acp©mrii}dati&gt;.*n and I have, therefore, requested L®nd©n t© send further inf@rmati©r If y©u have any such information ®r views I shall be much ©bilged if you will let me have them. I note from the Minutes ®f the Meeting held in London at the India Office on 16th july, 1947 that it was then suggested 'that it would be as cell to provide services for the building ®f living accommodation for the .Political Agent and his staff in the new Residency Compound since the standard of amenities there was likely t© oe higher than those in the Political Agency and it was highly undesirable that the subordinate staff of the two offices should have a marked differenciation of their conditions of life.' The possibility cf the P.A.’s requirements will, of course have a i*.rge bearing on the siting problems and I feel it would be as well to have this point cleared. The agreement to erect a two-stofey building for the three married officers for occupation by May, 1948, is, I fear, a practical impossibility as it is clear that there are no fittings @r supplies available in Bahrain and these w©uld have t.® tee imported from England. Knowing ©ur difficulties in getting the minimum supplies for existing works at present in progress in the Middle and Kea'r East - of which Walters may not have been aware - it would tee unfortunate if we promised something which we could not possibly carry out. The question of obtaining financial authority is also likely to delay matters as it has already been ruled that any long term solution will have to form part of the main scheme. I also feel it would be unwise to attempt to rush up a sub-standard • building costing at least £.15,000 and even if the Navy would be satisfied at present with such a building, ©nee our Residency buildings were completed the future naval occupants of such accommodation would consider that they had a legitimate grouse at the standard the M.O.W. hp.d provided for them. This latter argument may, I know, tee considered a lefcser one teut there is no doubt that we cannot obtain materials -t this stage to erect by May, 1948, and it would be most unfortunate if I did not make this point quite clear now. As we kn&amp;w the immediate admiralty requirements, financial authority is teeing sought for the erection of a new building vjased on the accommodation requirements forwarded by Walters, and sketch plans are teeing prepared sn that thee earliest start can oe made when approval is received. I trust that you will concur with this proposal. Yours sincerely, Sd/- J.a. Douglas. Sir Rupert Hay, KCSI., CIE., ETC.f2^ B A Q A Jigx2222d£ HRSI-AN^UX^:.

Since this Office will relinquish all responsibility for Bahrein in 1st April nexu, 1 think we must now leave it to you to reach a decision with the Admiralty (in consultation with the F.O. and Treasury) about the site and construction of che future Residency. The only point in regard to vy^ich we are directly concerned is the immediaue construction of a building at 'Z* on the r'lan to provide accommodation urgently required by the j.avy. You will remember that at the meeting on 18th September, wood of the Treasury gave it as his opinion that the cost of such temporary accommodation should be borne on the C.R. 0. rather than the Admiralty vote. It seems unlikely that any expenditure will be incurred during the current financial year, but if it is decided that the cost should be borne on our vote we should wish to be informed as once. R. A.

I also forward a copy of a letter since received from Baptain Dendy. With regard to the objection raised by Captain Dendy in his letter of the 3rd November, Mr. Walters has had trial holes dug on the site Y and reports that there is hard rock .close to the surface in the half of the site nearer to the Residency. There is however a minimum of 3 feet of soil in the other half and he is of -ppinion that there will not be any difficulty in providing a garden as good as that which already exists at B. When the new Residency is constructed much soil will be excavated which can be spread over the hard portion of site Y and it will certainly be possible to grow there trees and shrubs which will give ample shade. There are trees and shrubs at least 15 feet high round the fountain in the circular plot shown in the plan immediately west of the Residency.^ proposals contained in the enclosure appear to me satisfactory so far as this Residency is concerned and fair to the Royal Navy and I trust that it will be possible to adopt them. I would urge that in any case the building proposed at Z should be constructed immediately as it will be impossible for this Residency to spare any of the existing accommodation in the Naval Base‘until an alternative is provided. • 4 * I am sending a copy of this letter without its enclosures to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf.

In this event, and should a survey.confirm the existence of rock, it would seem that thefeolution and compromise arrived at is negatived for the provision of the swimming pool, tennis court etc in an area without surrounding vegetation and shade is not acceptable. sd/- R.

Ext, 2212 dated the 15th October 1947, 2. I forward herewith an advance copy of the Minutes of a meeting between Bendy, Walters and myself to find a temporary solution to the Admiralty’s accommodation difficulties and to select a site for a permanent Residency. I shall be forwarding a copy of the minutes officially with a plan in due course. The minutes are not fully intelligible without a plan, but will give you an idea of the decisions reached so far as we here are concerned. I consider Bendy has been very reasonable and I only hope the Admiralty will accept the recommendations. 5. In my telegram Ho. 1029 dated the 8th October I said I was coming round t o t n e v i ew fuat v. ! a should be wise to select the R.a.P. site for the Residency. In this I was influenced to some extent by Galloway who said he was afraid of friction if we lived cheek by jowl with the Kavy. The matter of academic interest to me as it is unlikely that any portion of the new Residency will be completed during here. In my opinion Jufair offers the best site for Residency from almost every point of view. If however recommendations we have made are not acceptable and is really s abs tantial my t en ur e the the ^ there is a prospect of prolonged haggling with the Admiralty or other authorities then we had better make up our minds at once to start work on the R.A.P. site. 4. In any case a long time is likely to elapse before the lay-out of the new Residency can be planned and buildings completed and it is unlikely we shall be in a position to vacate any of the buildings we at present occupy at Jufair for some years. I therefore very much hope that the recommendation in paragraph 2 of the minutes will be accepted and work on the proposed two-storey building started at once pending consider ation of our other recommendations. ii.p.

Temporary Measures to meet Admirlty^ need for I ncre ase d ac commoda tion . The Admiralty require urgently married quarters for three shore based officers. It was therefore agreed that a suitable two storey building should be erected at , Z I on Plan and be completed ready for occupation by May 1948. 3. Provision of site at Jufair for permanent Residency and rele ase of Admiralty bu ildings now occupied by P.R . The portion of the Jufair Naval Base proposed by the Ministry of Works as the site of the new Residency could not conveniently be released by the Admiralty whilst the Admiralty's counter proposal w a s considered inadequate by the Ministry of Works. It was decid ed that the site hatched blue on plan was suitable and could be released if the works proceeded as foliows*- (a) Prepare at 'Y' a garden including Tennis Court, Swimming Pool, Squash Court, Bate Palms etc.. This will take some years to mature and will ultimately be handed over to Admiralty to replace garden &amp;t *£ * whicii will be incorporated in Residency Compound.

This will not exceed £150 in any one year. ii.

'y^ is tr' I am oommanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to refer to the minutes of the meeting held at the Commonwealth delations Office on the 16th September to discuss7 inter alia, the re-occupation of certain^ buildings at the Bahrein Naval Base and Admiralty Message 091729 October, and to acquaint you that since the meeting was held a further submission has been received from the Commander-in-Chief, Bast Indies station, requesting that endeavour be made to recover possession of the Officers' Cabin Block rather than the Sick Bay Block. This will enable the .(.olloving accommodation to be provided:- 1 (a) Married Quarters for the Staff Office?,.(intelligence), (b) Single Quarters for the Staff Officer, (intelligencer's Cleri-:, (c) Single Quarters for the Clerk-in-Charge. A^ it is possible that on the relief of the present S.0.(l) s Clerir a married man will be appointed to this post who will aesire his wife to accomp8.ny him and as there is the possibility of a N.A.A.B.I. canteen manager being appointed at some future date, it is desired also that the Sick Bay Block may be recovered in due course. 2. As can be seen from the minutes, there were three possible solutions put forward to solve the problem of meeting the admiralty’s requirement*;in this respect, namely (i) the re—allocation or extension of existing buildings. (ii) the building of temporary accommodation for the 6.0.(l) and his clerk or for the Political Besident’s staff. This was considered undesirable but may possibly be unavoidable. (iii) Priority building for junior Married Quarters for the Political Resident’s staff to be incorporated in the Long Term building programme. 3* Confirmation has been received from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, that he will be present at Bahrein on the 24th October to meet the Political Resident and the Ministry of Works' representative to discuss this matter and the question of the site allocation -or the political Resident's residence. 4. My Lords desire me to state that if either alternatives (ii) or (iii) have to be adopted, they strongly urge that such building shall be completed before the onset of the next hot season in the Persian Gulf. 5* My Lords further desire me to state that, whilst they do not wish prematurely to raise the question of the terms and conditions under which the Admiralty will be prepared to make land in the Base available to the Ministry of Works, they would suggest that, apart from any other consideration which may later be agreed in drawing up the plans of the Political Resident's buildings, consideration be given to the sharing of the main services with the existing and displaced Naval building, ihey desire me further to emphasise that no expense arising out of any arrangements come to,either immediate or long term, should fall on Navy /otes. Under Secretary of State, Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street, London, 6.W.1.6. It is noted that in messag e No» 1029 from the ‘Political Resident there is now a suggestion that the~Residency may be built on the R.A.F. site and not in the Naval Base. Ifiy Lords, however, strongly urge that whatever decision may be come to on this particular question due consideration may still be given to the return or the Naval buildings prior to the next hot season. / .^—&gt; I am.

The actual work of installation of the air conditioning unit, etc. was completed by 31st July, the delay being due to Mr. Horner^s having to spend considerable time on the maintenance of the .generating sets. A statement showing expenditure up to the end of July is attached from which it will be seen that out of the grant of £ 2,500/-, there is a balance of £ 1,500/- unspent. 3. I understand from Turner of the Ministry of Works that the continued retention of Mr. Horner for maintenance of the air- conditioning units and generators has been approved by Government, and that his pay will be debited to the air conditioning grant until such time as he is taken into the employ of the Ministry of Works. Apart from being responsible for the maintenance of the air conditioning sets and electrical generating plants it is proposed to utilise the services of Mr. Horner for other mechanical work connected with the Residency, motor vehicles, batteries, telephones, water-pumps, wiring etc. Should, as appears to be the case, the maintenance of the common users services devolve on the Residency ( Secretary of State f s Express Letter No. Ext. 1295/47 of 17th June refers ) the services of Mr. Horner will be required and / in fact it would be quite impossible for the Residency to undertake this responsibility without assistance. Since Mr. Horner will be available the estimate being prepared for the work of maintenance of common users services will be considerably reduced. 4. The expenditure on the running of the generating sets as well as the income from the sale of electricity to the Residency, Navy, and members of the Residency staff have been included in the statement of expenditure and it will be seen that in fact the power house has been run at a profit. Question of the reduction in charges can be considered later. 5. An estimate of anticipated expenditure for the air conditioning grant for the remainder of the financial year is also attached for information. E.P.

Supply Rating in the did Sick Bay and for the 3,0,1, and family in the former Captain's quarters situated on the floor above of the same block. S ir Rupert Nay explained that the old Sick Bay was essential for the ackSonmodation of guests as the Residency had only two bedrooms. The former Captain's. quarters were being prepared for the Residency surgeon whose appointment had'already been agreed by the Treasury, In answer to a question Captain James said tha.t the admiralty could not guarantee to appoint an unmarried officer as o.O.I, as their supply of suitable personnel was strictly limited. The question of finding other accommodation for the naval staff was examined. It was considered that the construction of any additional semi-permanent accommodation was undesirable in principle though possibly unavo?.dable, and that it was preferable to press on with the construction of those buildings of^the new Residency which would accommodate the officers of the Political Resident’s staff so/- 2 - \ so enabling the required accommodation to be restored to the Navy. It was agreed that on his return to BAHREIN the Political Resident should discuss further vdth the S.N.O.P.O. whether any arrangement could be made to meet the Admiralty's needs, by allocation of existing accommodation or by temporary extension of existing buildings. iUiy long term solution would have to form part of the scheme for construction of a new Residency (see below). The Ministry of Works Surveyor who would be visiting BAHREIN in October might be invited to take part in these discussions. 2. SITE FOR THE NEW RESI D ENCY . Tne Representatives of the Foreign Office y Ministry of Works and Commonwealth Relations Office had agreed that the JUFAIR Naval Base provided by far the best site for the new Residency, and the Ministry of works had written to the Admiralty on this basis. The Admiralty felt, however, that it would be difficult for them to contemplate the loss of facilities and amenities which the Ministry of Works proposal would appear to entail. Among the points made in discussion was the advantage of a. compact site in order to economise in essential services, th -ugh it was recognised that this might involve dismantling certain naval buildings. Mp.». w^ou (Treasury; gave it a.s his pinion that if in the process ^f constructing the new Residency it should prove necessary to provide temporary accommodation ior the Navy in order that they night suffer no diminution of facilities the cost should be borne on the Commonwealth Relations Office rather than on the Admiralty vote.

The Officers* Cabin Block furnishes 2 . quarters for a Secretary and bachelor Under Secretary and the Captain’s House and Sick Bay Block is earmarked for the Residency Surgeon or the proposed Health Adviser. It is only because there is no Secretary at present that I have been able to allow the Clerk of the Staff Officer (Intelligence), Persian Gulf, to sleep in a room in the Officers' Cabin Block. It will not be possible for us to manage without either block. Indeed it is going to be very difficult when the two learners come out. I trust therefore that if and when the Admiralty ask for the return of one of the blocks every effort will be made to resist its surrender. E.P.

WILD GOOSE. 24th August, 1947 / THE HONOURABLE POLITICAL RESIDENT, PERSIAN GULF. (Copy to:- Staff Officer (Intelligence), Persian Gulf). The present living accommodation for the Clerk to Staff Officer (Intelligence) , Persian Gulf has proved unsuitable as a perm£nancey. 2. Another requirement has now arisen for living accommodation for a Clerk-in-Charge of the Base. At present this is a Naval Chief Petty Officer, but in six months time it will be a civilian. Temporary accommodation is being found for him in the N.A.A.F.l. Canteen but this cannot be regarded as permanent. i 3 . it is understood you are prepared on a temporary basis only to let the requirement for Staff Officer (Intelligence), Persian Gulf’s Clerk, vide paragraph (1) above, to be met by using one of the rooms in the Officer’s Cabin Block. It would be appreciated if this could be confirmed. 4. As Staff Officer (Intelligence), Persian Gulf is entitled to married quarters, it will be seen that the whole question requires reconsideration. 5. That no final and permanent agreement can be made virtually between us is fully recongised.^ I am therefore proposing to Commander-in-Chief, East Indies that the Admiralty should be asked to regain from the Foreign Office on our behalf, either the Officer’s Cabin Block or the old Captain's house and Sick Bay Block to meet our needs.

I had disagreed with the suggestion that the provision of amenities in the new residence of the political president at Bahrein should itself he made a ground for the provision of new amenities for the political Agent at Bahrein,and said that we could not agree to additional services in advance in order to provide for the political aP'ent, until we were satisfied that the move was likely to he made and had had an estimate of the cost of providing in advance for the -potential extra services.

(If reiyn 0 ffice) n it (Ministry of Works) it (India Office) it u Daildlny of a permanent ^iesidoncy at jjahrein for the Political Resident, Persian Calf. Reference was made to Hr.Turner 1 s report an this subject, prepared as a result of his recent visit to Bahrein. Sir Rupert Hay explained that tho present temporary quarters, in the Naval Base at Jufair, occupied by the Resident were altogether unsatisfactory since (a) the accomodation was quite inadequate oven for pro sent requirements; (b) temporary ni val hutments wore unsuitable for the housing of H.M.C f s Chief Political Representative in tho Persian Gulf and compared very unfavour ably with the housing: provided by the Bahrein Petroleum Co., for their representatives; (c) tho Admiralty had reserves the ri 0 ht to ro-occupy tho a.c commod at ion for tii-ir own use in an emergency. It was therefore' a., rood that in order to provide essential housing for the Political Resident and his Staff it was necessary to build a. now permanent Residency as soon a.s possible. The first point for consideration was the site to be selected. un this Mr.Turner stated, and Sir R.Hay agreed, that by far the best site was that which had been projected in the Naval Base at Jufair, The land required for the Residency buildings wan about 15 a.c res, and the C. in C. East Indies wan known to object to its surrender, but there should be/be plenty of roon both for the Navy and the Residency on the site. The alternative was a piece of land owned by the dir Ministry, but this site, in dir import Hay* s and Mr.Tumcr’s opinion, was nothing like so pood as Jufair. Other sites, which would involve purchase of land in the open market at eixprbitant cost, and the nakinp of expensive approach roads, were open to objection on financial grounds. It was decided to press the Admiralty to release the site in the Naval Base. As regards the accommodation to bo provided in a now Residency, the question was raised whether it would bo necessary also to provide living accommodation for the Political Agent, Bahrein, and his Staff, on the same site. It was agreed that it would in any ca.se be essentia.! to rota.in the present political Agency building in the town for the next few years, a.t least for office accommodation. It was suggested, however, that it would be as well to provide services for the building of living accommodation for the Political Agent and his Staff in the new Residency compound^ since the standard of amenities there was likely to be hgiher than those in the Political Agency, and it would be highly undesirable tha.t the subordinate staffs of the two offices should have a. marked differentiation in their conditions of life. If the Residency compound were planned on a generous scale to provide for later expansion which would inevitably occur with oil development in the Persian G-ulf Sheikhdoms on the increase, this would bo likely to prove economical in tho long run. It was agreed that planning might pro coed on the assumption that provision should be made to accommodate the present scate of the Residency's own sta.ff, and should be on a sufficiently liberal scale to take account of the likelihood of exp am ion to includ. the Political . goncy Staff, It was accordingly agre ed:- (a.) that Ministry of Works should, with the supporter tho Foreign Office, India. Office, and Treasury, approach the admiralty forthwith to secure the necessary site at Jufair; (b) that Ministry of Norbs should procood at once with the detailed planning of a new Residency, on the lines agreed, and submit proposals to the Treasury for approval. Arrangements for maintmruicc t repa irs, et c, to the temporary Residency and Agencies at Kowcit, Bahrein and Muscat. (a.) So far as the temporary Residency was concerned it was agreed that the present position was satisfactory for t-he time being, (b) *.s regards the question of the retention of Indian P.Y/.D. sta.ff to look after tho Agencies, it was mentioned that an Engineer had recently been sent to the Persian G-ulf by the Government of India, to make recommendations for the reorganisation of staff, and his report is still awaited. It was agreed that the Government of India should bo asked to let H.M.G. know a.s soon as possible v/hat these recommendations are* It would probably be3 V necessary to ask the Government of India to retain, on suitable terms the minimum necessary P.Yf.D. staff as recom mended by the Government of India’s Pn ;incer to look after the buildings on the Arab coast, for so long as they remained the property of the Government of India* ¥hen the buildings were taken over by H.1I. G. , maintenance would be arranged by Ministry of Works staff under the superintendence of their Cairo office. ( c) _ The Political liosidont u ndertook to discuss with the Ministry of Works the revised works programme on the Grab Side for 1947-^8 (Sir R.Hay*s letter Wo. 1433-93/2-B of 23rd Juno to the Government of India). 3. approach to tho Government of India th roug h the U. 14 High Commissioner for obtaining forii.M. G*s represent at ives accommodation at places, in llopal, af-jhanistan, Persia., Persian Gulf ano India. H.M.G*s requirements at tho following places were discussed in the following order: (a) Katmandu . Tho Government of India had stated that they wanted the present Legation buildings for their own Ambassador rwho was expected to arrive by the end of august. Col.Falconor had put forv/ard a schono for dividing the office accommodation between the ,14 and Indian Missions, but this contemplated assigning the Legation house to tho U. 14 Ambassador and building a house for the head of tho Indian Mission. There was no other suitable accommodation for tho Ui 14 Ambassador, although the Maharaja had offered one of the Rana Palaces for temporary use. This was, however, believed to bo an Eastern stylo building and rather unsuitable for European use. It might be airee for the Indian Ambassador, (b) ffeshod Tho Government of India own the buildings and land of tho Consulate-General said have stated that they wish to take them over shortly. Both H.M.G. and the Government of India wish to station Consul s-Gonoral there, mid thv.ro is little (if any) other accommodation available in Meshed apart from the present British Consulate-General. If II.! 4G* were to bo left without a building a his would be very unfortunate for British prestige vis-a-vis both the Persians, and the Russians (who also maintain a Gonsulato-Goncral at Meshed). The point was also made that both Hindustan and Pakistan (since Meshed was a place of Shiah Moslem pilgrimage) might very jell be interested in having represent atives at Meshed. It was agreed that H.M.G. ought to stake out their claim to the continued use of tho Consulate-General buildings, by purchase or otherwise; the Government of India should be approached without delay. ( c) Kabul. Here again the Government of India, own the Legation buildings, which represent the only accommodation available for diplomatic representation, though neither India nor Pakistan had yet stated their intentions regarding tho estab lishment of serrate Missions in Afghanistan. Prom the political and diplomatic poind of view, the Foreign 0ffi.ee consid red it of the highest importance that H.M.G. should secure possession of the Legation buildings. They had cost- 4 ~ a largo omount (alout £160,000) to 'build, 'but building costs in Afghanistan had sinco then risen considerably and it v/as unlikely that a now Logsation, even on a. smaller scale, could be built for loss than this sum If the building could be ccurod at the cost price, we should bo getting a. good bargain. It vans agreed that it was desirable to put in a bid for the buildings at a very early date. Meanwhile, H.M.G. intended to offer to maintain the existing; establishment, at U. K. expense, in order to tide over the difficult interim period. (d) Bushire. The present consular buildings here include (1) the old Sabzabad Residency, (2) the Naidi property, (3) the Town Residency Office, (4) the Assistant Engineer’s house. Both 11.11. CM s and the Government of India’s present intentions are to keep onHyVice-Consuls at Bushire, and it should not be difficult to come to an arrangement with the Government of India regarding division of accommodation. It was thought that the Sabzabad Residency and the Town Residency could probably be sold as superfluous to requirements, H.M.G. taking a proportion of the sale price in accordance with the amount they have paid in the past. (c) Roman. The Government of India require the present consular buildings but II. II. G. have no need to retain their use. It v/as thought that this point might be made use of, in negotiations with the Government of India, on the credit side. ( f) Shiraz. The Government of India have no recuirements, but H.M.G. will require the present house and property, and it is necessary to make n offer for them to the Government of India. (g) Bahrein, Kowcit a]id M uscat . H.M. . will require all the Agency buildings at these posts. The Government of India will require some accommodation for repre sentatives at Bahrein and Muscat. At Bahrein they may appoint either a Consul (if II. 11.G. agree, which is unlikely) or a Trade Agent; in cither case the Agency will be too large for their needs. At Musca t they will probably appoint a non-career Consul, for whom also the present I.genoy will be too large and unsuitable. At Kowci t the Government of India do not intend to appoint any representative, for the time being at least. In all throe eases it is essential to purchase the Agency buildings for H.M. G. bringing in to the transaction any contributions v/hich TJ.K. revenues have made in the past towards the cost. ( h) Buildings required by the U, PR High Commissioner in India . It was agreed that from the point of view of an approach to the Government of India those buildings were really on a different footing from those in (a) to (g), and that it would probably be best not to link them with the others in an approach to the Government of India. The point slight, however, be/uo loft oO Sir T. Shone! s discretion in enso ho thought an 3 r advantage could bo derived from it. I t was agree d that a telegran should be sent forum/ith to Sir. T. Shone instructing him to nulce an approach to the G-ovornnont of India as SC'CH &lt;as possible, in order to stake out 11.1,1. G-’s claim to those buildings which they required. The Treasury representatives said that their establishment side would n, d to be satisfied th^t th^ prop sed establishments at tsese posts warranted the acquisition of the buildings in question and it was agreed to send the clrsoit telegram to .the Treasury for their concurrence beiore issue. It was pointed out, however, tnat the exact size of the establishments would probably make little difference where the only possible buildings were those which it was proposed to accuire from the Government of India. The Ineia Oflice undertook to prepare and circulate draft telegrams K to 3ir T. Shone cn the ?_ines agreed. The Foreign Office undertook to draft a .ersor^l letter from Mr.Bovin to Mr.Nohru in sup ort of Sir T. Shone's approach. It was agree ; that reference might be made in ±u to Mr.i.J’ohru* s recent roquoat for tnc provision of acccO” mod at ion for Kri shna Menon* s establishi.ient in London, which H.M.G-. are willing to meet. sc Dm.-fto now acta.ched., It is proposed that those telegrams shoulu oe despatched to the U, K«, H.C. n &gt;t la.ter than 6 p«m« on Friday 2jth July, suojoct .to any amendments received from Departments by that tine.

Yours sincerely. E.P. Donaldson, Esq., C.M.G., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.NOTE ON FUTURE ARRANGEMEL'ITS REGARDING POLITICAL RESIDENCY AND AGENCIES ON THE ARAB SHORE OF THE PERSIAN GULF. A. TE1.PORARY AGCO, IIODATION FOR POLITICAL RESIDENT AT BAHREIN 1. Y/hen it was decided at the beginning of last year to move the Persian Gulf Residency from Bushire to Bahrein, the only suitable buildings available on the island were the offices of the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, who it had recently been decided should go afloat. It was, therefore, agreed with the Admiralty that the Jufair Naval Base buildings should be made available to the Political Resident, with the proviso that should they once more be required by the Admiralty (as a result of an emergency) they would immediately be made available* The Admiralty have recently suggested that in equity the cost of the common maintenance services of the roads, water mains etc, of the base should be borne on the India Office (or Foreign Office) vote. The Political Resident’s observations on this proposal are awaited, 2* The existing buildings required considerable modification before they were suitable for the Residency, and plans for the alterations were drawn up and the work is being performed by the Indian P,W,D, (or local contractors) on an agency basis for H^ii.G, The Political Resident has submitted estimates for various works at a total estimated cost of £3 J 772,10,0d, Three separate amounts of £1,000 and one amount of £772,10,0d, have been sanctioned to the Political Resident (October *4-th, November Ath, November 30th, 1946 and 21st February, 1947)* 3, The Political Resident has been granted permission to spend up to £500 out of the Central Contract Grant of Rs,40,000 on repairs to the Residency Buildings at Jufair (23rd June, 1947) during the course of the current financial year. (This grant is a non-auditable lump sum contract grant intended to cover repairs to the Persian Gulf Residency, the xvowe it Agency, and the S. Persian Consulates which has been passed as a standing charge by Finance Department, Government of India in recent years. It appears in the Residency Budget)• In addition sanction has been given for the installation of a system 4.2 . of air conditioning for the Residency at a maximum cost of £2,500 (The 14W. Architect from Cairo, who recently visited Bahrein, has approved the scheme). Owing to the inability of the Bahrein State Electric Company to provide power for the air conditioning plant two Naval generators have been taken over to provide both light and power for the Residency. It is estimated by the Political Resident that the cost of running these generators will be covered by payments made by private consumers together with the sum of Rs. 750 per month previously paid to the State Electricity Ccmpary. B. PERMANENT RESIDENCY TO BE BUILT FOR THE POLITICAL RESIDENT .AT BAHREIN — f -r--* ----- -I r r • ■ - - -m i- —• , r * ' ■ IT r ^ r “ T r ,rr - ■- .r - ^ t, -■ r t- - r- _ /• The Admiralty have insisted that the Political Residents tenancy of the Naval Base at Jufair can be considered to be a temporary measure only and it is therefore necessary to build a new pemanent Residency at Bahrein. The Ministry of Works have agreed that the cost of this scheme should be borne on their Vote. 1. Mr. Turner, the Ministry of Works Architect from Cairo, accompanied by an engineer^visited the island March 21st - 30th, 1947? and inspected some nin6 possible sites. Six of these he ruled out as being unsuitable for various reasons. Of the remaining three he considered the area of the Jufair naval base to be the best^with the land owned by the Air Ministry around the Air Liaison Officer* s f^cuse as a second choice. His third suggestion, land owned by the Bahrein Petroleum Ccmpanyjcannot be considered at the moment as the Compary has refused to sell. As far as planning and estimating are concerned^ the Architect was unable to commit himself until the size and character of the Political Resident* s staff should be decided. He did, however, prepare with the Political Resident a rough schedule of accommodation, talcing into account all known factors. He suggested that the requirements should be discussed in detail between the Foreign Office and * Political Resident before ary further steps were taken by the Ministry of Works. j It is desirable to proceed as soon as possible with the construction of a new Residency, since the present temporary quarters are inadequate and detrimental tonrestige. \ .% 3.

In connection with the transfer of the Persian Gulf administration from the Government of India to His Majesty's Government, the latter proposed in March that office and living accommodation In the Arab States which would have to he retained to maintain the administration, should he taken over hy His Majesty's Government from the Government of India hy arrangement and at a price to he agreed between the two Governments^hearing in mind the contributions made hy Imperial revenues in the past, With a view to negotiations with His Majesty's Government^ /fee Government of India sent a Superintending Engineer from Delhi 'feuildings and lands and to arrive at as good as possible an estimate of the present day value of the property,&amp;fter consulting the Political Agents and other local authorities. 'fhe Political Resident has submitted a statement of the capital cost of the buildings in question^ together with the cost of alterations and additions during the last 11 years. As regards Office equipment, furniture, etc. the Political Resident has been requested to provide lists giving an up to date valuation of all equipment. 2. P.W.D .Works These are being carried out by the Indian P.W.D. on an agency bas.i.s for His Majesty's Government during the current financial yearythe cost being met by His Majesty's Government. Government of India considered it necessary that no considerable new work, either major or minor^ should betaken toing the current year without the consent of His Majesty's Government^^nd^the Political Resident should cut the existing P.W.D. Budget and Current Works Programne to the minimum. The Political Resident has agreed to cut as many works as possible^ but does not propose to reduce the provision| made for special repairs^ as all the buildings will have to be lived in by Government officials for at least 2-3 years to come. He also points out the difficulty in separating the cost of work on the Persian side from that on the Arab side. The Government of India Superintending Engineer will examine the offices of the independent Persian Gulf P.W.D. in each station visited,and recommend measures for the immediate /winding) (fb, winding--up of the Organisation and reduction of staff. He will also advise on curtailing the Budget, where possible, and on the transfer of existing vital work to local contractors. It should be noted that the G-ovemrnent of India only agreed to continue to work on an agency basis for financial year ending Apiil 1st 1948 so it is in^^ative that M.O.W. should take steps to provide a substitute for the Independent Persian Gulf P.W.D. service.

Ay^Barker mljh di*g:wlTig3 122/47/7 Mr, Mole BAHREIN First Visit, period March 21st to 30th t 1947* For convenience my report will be divided into the following headings s- (a) General Conditions (b) Sites (c^ Future proposals Td^) Local construction methods (e) Contractors (f) Materials Tg^ Existing position (h; Position regarding other properties in Southern Persia. General Conditions The Island is approximately 30 miles long by 8 miles wide and as the main industries are confi&amp;d to oil and pearl fishing very little development has taken place. The population, including Arabs, Iranians, Indians, Iraqis and Europeans, is alleged to be in the region of 100,000 but with the exception of Awali where about 3*000 company operatives are living, practically the entire population is centred in the two sea coast towns of Manama and Muharraqq (see plan 4f island attached). In the other villages dotted about the inhabitants number a few hundred and exist by fishing or cultivating palm groves with a very poor yeild. The island itself is in the main a rocky si(ady waste which in the centre rises to a height of approximately 400 feet above sea level and the only good roads existing at present link up the chief centres of Manama, Muharraqq, Awali and Sitra Island. Such semi-permanent buildings as exist are constructed of coral walls with floors and roofs of mangrove poles covered with palm fronds finished with approximately 3 ins. of concrete or mud, but the natives, who are in the majority, live in mud huts or barastis, the latter being lightly constructed of mangrove poles and palm leaves and in high^ winds or gales are liable to collapse. In the case, however, of the oil centre at Awali, the Americans have progressed considerably and are now erecting spacious prefabricated timber houses with a proper networjc ox roads. The houses are air conditioned and they have modern sewage, lighting, gas and telephone services installed and operated at the expense of the oil company. Sanitation generally is primitive but a few of the better houses sited on the sea coast have sewage systems which discharge into the sea. In the case of the other so-called essential services, the electricity supply is insufficient to meet the demands but a new generating station is now in course of construction. At present there is no main water supply system and rather brackish drinking water is obtained from wells or sea water distillation plants. Messrs. Holloway Bros, of London have however just been given the contract for supplying the town with water and hope to complete the scheme in about 18 months time. Owing to the poor construction of the houses th^r ater mains will in general only serve the main streets and at various centres there will be supply lpoints. The existing telephone installation is completely out of date I and owing to its defifiencies is rarely used. There are no gas services. The Government consists of the Sheikh of Bahrein plus his immediate relatives and a British Le#£l Adviser who acts in the capacity of a prime Minister. Under the existing treaty with the United Kingdom we have a good deal to do with the administr^tipn_of the island and such regulations etc. that exist are based on-fngiish Law. The Trega^ Adviser for instance presides at the local courts and pronounces sentences, and in addition we have a Political Agency (which comes under the political Residents supervision) and a purely British court. /Transport isTransport is by car, although I believe very irregular private bus services operate for the use of arabs and other natives. The climate is typical of the Persian Gulf for, although the temperatures during the hot weather season of six months rarely exceeds 105 degrees on the coast, the maximum humidity averages 90 per cent and sometimes rises as high as 98 per cent. Inland the conditions are less unpleasant for, although the temperature sometime reaches 118 degrees, the humidity is far less than in the case of the coastal regions. The weather during the winter, which lasts for from 3 to k months, is mild and pleasant, but at night the temperature is sufficiently low to justify some form of heating. The coirrolete meteorological report will be submitted however by Kim to the Chief Engineer direct. The prevailing wind, which is generally accepted to be a dry one, is from the North West. This, however, quite often fails during the hot weather and from the middle of July to the middle of October the Island is subjected from tiem to time to a South East Wind which is moisture laden; this wind usually blows for periods of from 3 to 4 days. Diseases Malaria is one of the most prevalent diseases and is found principally in the centre of the towns of Manama and Muharraqq. Along the sea front where the majority of the Europeans reside there is a remarkable freedom from mosquitoes and malaria. There is a large and growing Iranian population in the town referred to above and experience has proved that most of the town cases are from this community; in all probability they were infected before their arrival in Bahrein. Mosquito breeding places are to be found around wells^ in gardens and in the drainage and irrigation channels. The malaria seasons are in the Autumn and early Spring, The other prevalent diseases are dysentery of the amoebic type, which is of course found all the year round; smallpox, principally in the villages; eye diseases, a lar^-e proportion of the inhabitants being infected with trachoma; and venereal diseases v/hich at present it is impossible to control as those infected will not attend for treatment once the acute symptoms have subsided. In dealing with the site problem I was initially handicapped owing to the lack of plans and other information but I was subsequently able to arrange to fly around the island which enabled me to obtain a clear picture of the development areas, general layout etc. etc., and in addition I toured the island by cab. Summing up, I am convinced that the one and only attraction is to live by the sea. Inland the climatic conditions are better but one would be completely isolated being 10 to 15 miles away from the main centre of Manama. The sole recreations appear to be boating, swimming (in pools^for sea bathing is dangerous owing to the presence of sharks), riding, tennis and in addition there is a very poor 9 -bole golf course which I gather is not very often patronised. One thing I have forgotten to mention is that for about 5 months in the year cricket is qu&lt;*te popular amongst the Europeans and Indians and as regular fixtures are arranged we may well have to consider the inclusion of a cricket field in our future proposals. The general living conditions for Europeans are very similar to those which exist in India for innumerable servants are employed and in nearly all cases they have to be provided with accommodation. Owing to the poor condition of the soil nearly all food is inported and in the case of the Service Departments during war time vegetables and meat etc. were flown in daily from Iraq. Postal and telegraph services are at present run by the Indian Government and the currency is also Indian, i.e. Rupees. /Sites - ReportSites - Report on inspecting In all nine sites were inspected and these are marked on the attached site plan of Bahrein Island. I Jufair II Air Ministry III J.A.P.C. 0. IV Essex Point ? V Portugese Point L ^ ^ VI Bdaiya’a VII Rifa VIII Zallaq DC Muharraqq (Ras Busaitin) Ik). I Jufair (see plan of Island and site plan No. I attached) is at present the property of the Admiralty and during war time was an active naval base. Now many buildings are unoccupied and the site is I understand only used for recreational purposes when sloops attached to the Persian Gulf Naval Command anchor offshore for a few days. One Naval officer, however, with the rank of Commander, is at present resident in the Senior Naval Officer 1 s house (see plan). All the hatched buildings are at present occupied by the Political Residents Department for either residential or office purposes. Under certain circumstances the base may be put into full use again but no doubt the Secretariat can obtain further information on this point by consulting the Admiralty. The site is flat and approximately 5 feet above sea level, and by comparison with other sites in Bahrein it commands very attractive views over the Bay and looking towards J&amp;&lt;|uharraqq Island. With its extensive foreshore all existing buildings overlook the sea and yet at the same time, they could have been orientated to receive the full benefit of the prevailing North West wind. By road Juf sir is approximately 2-g- miles from the centre of Manama and from this point of view the location is ideal. The total area of the site is approximately 72 acres and it will be noted that the major development is within the vicinity of the Naval Jetty, marked 'A”. Nature of Soil Sand overlaying soft rock, but the nature of the soil is such that bad areas might be encountered for it is typical of Bahrein that trial holes dug say 30 feet apart often indicate entirely different conditions'. General opinion however seems to confirm that Jufair is one of the best building sites in the area and ail the Naval buildings are said to have been built on rock varying from 2 to M feet below the surface. Water Supply Existing on site is a sea water distillation plant which was originally built by the Admiralty, but is now rented and operated by the Bahrein Municipality. Water can however be tapped at a level of approximately 300 feet below the surface by sinking bore holes. A full report is being submitted by the Engineers. Electricity Supply The Navy have their own generating plant for use in an emergency but the main town supply is at present being used by the Political Resident’s Office and although complaints have been registered no serious failing has occurred. (Pull details will be given in the Engineer’s report). Sewage The effluent from septic tanks is drained into the sea. /Generallyi Generally The site is not in a built-up area although there are a few native villages nearby* The main approach road to lianama is a good one with a termac surface. Recommendations In considering our problem only, the site to my mind is ideal from all points of view and easily the best of those I inspected , for the following reasons fa) It is the property of ?b^ It is not in a built-up area. (ct Excellent location and views. (d) Rock sub-siol. (e) On sea coast and therefore it is easy to dispose of soil drainage effluent. S Good road to llanama. Finally I suggest that it must be an advantage to have the Naval Base and Political Resident*s Office on the same sice. Unfortunately at this stage it is impossible to give an accurate estimate of the future accommodation requirements and the area site required is therefore difficult to assess. However the area of jjust under 20 acres coloured red (see plan No. 1), and which should prove adequate, is I think the most suitable for our needs for it has a long stretch of undeveloped foreshore which in the main faces North (a great advantage). If the Admiralty agree to our taking possession we may be asked to build a Senior Naval Officer's house, a swimming pool, a cinema and also have to develop a garden on another part of the site, but during my visit it proved impossible to ascertain the future Naval requirements and therefore the need for a permanent Senior Naval Officer's house etc. etc. should be confirmed. ^ The gardens marked 'B' are unfor tunate ly alleged to be agreat attraction from the Navy's point of view andTmay bum out to be one of the stumbling blocks if the negotiations do take place. It is possible that on the advice of the Senior Naval Officer the Admiralty will argue that we could develop their recreation field at 'C”, but this is not an alternative that should be considered for it is inland and has no access to the fore-shore which, as I have already pointed out, is essential. Another possible objection is my proposal to take over the cricket ground (marked 'D') but this can easily be overcome by developing the area either within or adjacent to the running track. Another point in favour of our acquiring the area marked red is that we already occupy a number of the existing buildings and further, as the site is on the foreshore there are very few mosquitoes. In conclusion, the price will have to be agreed with the Admiralty for I was unable to obtain any local information, but for your guidance land in the Vicinity has recently changed hands at costs varying between £500 and £750 per acre. Site No. II The site belongs to the Air Ministry and is referred to in Barker* s personal letter to me of 25th February. The total area amounts to approximately UA acres including the Air Liaison Officer's house (see site plan attached) and in addition the Anglo Iranian Oil Company are interested; the latter however only require a small parcel of land and prior to my arrival negotiations had, at the request of the Ministry of Works, been temporarily suspended by the Air Ministry. The remainder of the site is undeveloped except for a few temporary buildings erected in war time and now on short term lease to the British Overseas Airways Corporation* In view of the fact that in all probability we shall not wish to acquire more than say 20 acres I agreed, after consultation with the Political Resident, Col. Hay, that the negotiations between the A.I.O.C. and the Air Ministry could be proceeded with, for the part of the site they are interested in (see plan) is only a small one and still leaves us with an available area of approximately 52 acres. Further, the proposed A.I.O.C. site is in a convenient position from our point of view, and if we do purchase the /remaining/ /^ending remaining land it will be all to the good to have houses of British concerns on either side of us. Prom the plan of Manama attached it will be noted that the site is located on the outskirts of the town and that there is a good approach road up to within 300 ft. of the Western Boundary. We could also obtain access from the road marked 'X”, although from the map this does not seem possible. There are however a number of alternatives which would have to be agreed with the Bahrein Municipality and I have therefore not indicated any proposed new roads. The site is flat, completely devoid of trees, shrubs or foliage and approximately 4 ft. above sea level. With its extensive sea front it commands pleasant views over the Bay and towards Muharraqq Island. Although the main foreshore faces Bast all houses could be orientated and planned to receive the full benefit of the prevailing north West wind. Nature of Soil Sand overlaying soft rock, loose shale and coral. Before any building work could be put in hand it would be necessary to dig a number of trial holes so that the exact nature of the sub-soil conditions could be ascertained. But quite large buildings have already been erected on the site and I do not anticipate any difficulties. Water Supply As in the case of Jufair, water can be tapped at a level of 300 ft. below the surface by sinking bore holes. Electricity Supply The town supply is available being already connected up to adjacent buildings. Sewage # The effluent from our sewage disposal plant could be drained into the sea. Generally Although the site is in a more built-up area than Jufair it is sufficiently extensive for us to avoid erecting buildings in close proximity to nearby native huts, and on the Northern boundary (see the road marked 'X”) the property is of a good class for Bahrein. Another good point is that the Sheikh f s Palace is only a few hundred yards away and because of this building in the area is bound to be restricted to better class dwellings. The graveyard is, I understand, an old one and not now used. Recomme ndations This site is not in such a good position as Jufair for its orientation is slightly less favourable and the outlook is not quite so pleasant. In addition its immediate proximity to Manama might be considered a disadvantage, but nevertheless the site is a good one and should prove quite easy to develop. Further, the land is the property of H.M.G. and the purchase price should therefore be reasonable, but it is sincerely hoped that the Air Ministry are not approached unless it is certain that the Admiralty find it impossible to consider our taking over part of the Jufair site. Site No. Ill This site is owned by the Bahrein American Petroleum Company. It was originally intended that a General Manager's house should be built, but in recent years the proposal has not been viewed favourably and it is now unlikely that it will ever be developed. During the past few months B.A.P. C. 0. have been approached by both the Anglo Iranian Oil Company and the British Overseas Airways Corporation and the General Manager has already written to his Headquarters in the United State asking for instructions, but he seems fairly csrtain that the sale of the site will be sanctioned and has agreed.pending confirmation, that we are to be given preference over the A. I.O#C* and the B. O.A. C. (The site has been very roughly valued at £7,500). In the case of the latter it is not certain that they are still interested and so far as the A.I.0,0. are concerned they can also be ruled out if their negotiations with the Air Ministry ultimately prove successful (refer to Site II), It will be noted from the map of Manama that the B.A.P.C. land is adjacent to site No. II and is therefore within a few minutes by car of the centre of Manama. It is bounded on nearly all sides (see map attahced) by roads (at present consolidated earth) and has the same outlook etc. as the Air Ministry site. The total area is 15.49 acres but only 13*31 'would be available for building purposes for the rest is foreshore. A disadvantage is therefore that future expansion will be limited and there is a possibility that the site would not be large enough at the outset and no decision can be reached until schedules of accommodation are agreed upon* The sub^iaf conditions etc. etc. are the same- as in the case of Site No. II, except that in the South East corner there is quite an attractive garden with a number of palm trees. There are also two flowing wells which at present discharge into the sea. Site No. IV - Essex Point Essex Point has been given a good deal of consideration in the past, but I entirely rule it out for the following reasons It would be necessary to build an approach road about one mile long, lb) It faces the wrong way. (c) The locality is poor and the site itself is covered by innumerable mud huts and barastis, (d) Some difficulty might be experienced in arranging for the sale for we should have to put out one or two fairly wealthy and influential Arabs. (e) Owing to the proximity of extensive palm groves the mosquito problem would have to be contended with. (f) it is also adjacent to a large graveyard which is still being used* Site No. V - Portugese Fort This site need not be given consideration for although it faces due north, and advantage, the locality is poor and we should have to build an approach road nearly three miles long, for at present there is only a rough uneven desert track. In addition there are very sharp variations in level which would increase the building costs. Site No. VT - Badaiya’a . Badaiya f a was at one time favoured by the Political Resident, Col. Hay, but as it is over 8i- miles from Manama it can be ruled out. The nearest road is nearly six miles away from the proposed site. Site No. VII - Rif a . Although Rifa is over 400 ft. above sea level and commands attractive views over the Island, the political Resident agrees that it is too far from Manama* It is therefore isolated from the sea, which as pointed out in my report on the general conditions is the main attraction of Bahrein. The only buildings in the locality are the Sheikas summer palace and a few huts. No essential services are available although water could be obtained from bore holes. Site No. VIII - Zallaq. To my mind Zallaq is in an ideal position but it is completely ruled out owing to the fact that it is over 17 miles from Manama. It is unnecessary therefore to go into any further details. Site No* IX - Muharraqo. The aspect of this site is good but the locality is poor and the proximity to the air field would be a constant source of annoyance. In addition the bridge linking Muharraqq and Manama is closed (to allow for shipping) for a considerable time each day and everyone agrees that this would be a serious disadvantage for, as previously mentioned, Manama is the main shopping and business centre. Future Requirements It is extremely difficult to give anything like an accurate estimate of future requirements* To begin with, I am certain that the question has not been given serious consideration by the Political Resident or his staff who state that it is difficult to forecast what may happen during the coming year /owing to7 owing to the fact that the Persian Gulf area is, to a degree, affected by conditions in India* Schedules of accommodation etc* etc. were eventually prepared and will be referred to later in this report* Plans and estimates of a Political Residency were drawn up prior to the war by the Public Works Department but they are no longer of any use having been designed on far too lavish a scale* The plans in fact show the proposed building to be far bigger than the average Embassy and in addition it was designed as a three storey building with the general offices occupying the entire ground floor* This would not meet present day Eoreign Office requirements* Attached is a schedule (prepared by the P.R*s office and approved by the Political Resident, Col. Hay) of staff for whom it is suggested that accommodation will be necessary* Further notes are enclosed giving an indication as to the scale of the accommodation required* The general question however must be discussed in detail with the Foreign Office who should, I suggest, go into the matter very thoroughly v/ith the Political Resident before we aqre brought into the picture. To my mind the proposals as they stand are vague and in some cases unsound* Important points that will need to be settled are given under (a) Whether or not the future policy will be to continue employing Indian secretarial and clerical staff, for if so this will affect the general planning of the compound (see Paragraph 2 of the p,R f s notes on accommodation). (b) Extent of the Political Resident’s social obligations, i.e. number of bedrooms, size of dining room, and need or otherwise for a ballroom etc. etc* (c) Whether or not the staff of the Political Agency (details of which can be obtained from the India Office) now working and living in Manama should be provided with houses, for if not their living conditions will compare very unfavourably with those of the Political Resident’s staff* (d) Actual type and extent of accommodation to be provided for menials and industrial staff. I make this point as in the Political Resident’s notes on the scales of accommodation it is suggested that in certain cases barastis would be sufficient. I, however, am definitely against this form of temporary construction as it would inevitably involve us in considerable annual maintenance. In the case of (b) above, ny own view is that the Political Residency should be planned on two floors and include the tollowing;— (a) Reception room, say 35 ft* by 22 ft* o ins. with access off an internal hall, say 22 ft. 6 ins. by 22 ft. 6 Tns., and planned so that they could be used as one room during large receptions. (f) (g) (h) (i) Small lounge approximately 400 ft. square Boudoir also 400 ft. square. Dining room to seat maximum of 20. Possibly a small study say 350 ft. square. Political Resident’s bedroom suite to include one double Bedroom, one single, a dressing room and two bathrooms, principal, guest’s double bedroom suite with dressing room and one bathroom with separate W.C. Two further double bedrooms each with their own bathroom etc* Three single bedrooms, two of which could share a bathroom* /(j) Usual(j) Usual domestic Offices. (k) Servants 1 compound. (l) Garden of approximately 2 acre s including a swimming pool and tennis court# Note. Despite the small population of Bahrein the Political Resident states that it is essential on certain occasions to he able to entertain up to 200 people. The number of bedrooms is also influenced by the fact that at present there is no hotel in Bahrein and consequently the P.R. has more than the usual number of guests. In the case of the Secretaries 1 accommodation I suggest that the senior men should be provided with a four-bedroom house, plus dining room for 12 and a reception room approximately 450 ft. square. Three-bedroom houses should prove adrquate in the case of the other senior staff. The bathroom question is important and there should be one to each bedroom. All European houses must have:- (a) Coirplete summer air conditioning. (b) Facilities for heating one or two rooms at night during the winter months, (c) Mosquito netting to all door and window openings. (d) A spacious verandah or verandahs facing North West. (e) Kitchens planned on modem and up-to-date lines (plus cold rooms or large refrigerators) and possibly installed with electrical cooking equipment (oil cooking is general at the moment). (f) Ample space for storage. (g) Small private gardens. In the case of the so-called Public Works staff, we shall del initely require a permanent foreman, but I foresee the need for typists or draughtsmen. So far as amenities are concerned I definitely think that everything possible should be provided for the staff and in addition to swimming pools, tennis courts etc. etc. (see schedule) I suggest that a. squash court mighu be considered, plus a small Jetty for boats. In audition the pioposed club building should be planned so that films can be shown. The point that struck me very forcibly is that Bahrein is so flat, the coastal regions being only a few feet above sea levelm that even oo raise the houses or bungalows a few feet Bore than normal above ground level proves a tremendous advantage, for it enables one to obtain a much better view and at the same time receive the full benefit of the prevailing wind. I cannot overstress this point which will be difficult for anyone without local knowledge to appreciate. 'Even now it is noticeable how people congregate on first floor cerandahs which in many cases open off bedrooms, in preference to remaining on the ground floor. A great deal more could be said about future requirements but before doing so I would prefer to await the Foreign Office observations as to the extent and nature of the accommodation necessary. The matter is of course an urgent one for in all cases the tenporary existing residential and office accommodation is inadequate and well below standard. if , owing to the uncertainty of the situation, the Foreign Office for the time being feel unable to make any useful observations that I c*n, as a guide prepare a detailed schedule and estimate based on existing requirements. /As to building(US) As to building costs, it is difficult to pass an opinion afoer such a short stay for there is no proper contractual system and a further complication is that the existing standards of building are far below normal, I was fortunately able to discuss the matter with the representative of Holloway Bros., the Contractors, and he suggested that if we worked on a figure of 3/6 per foot cube we should not be far out. This figure was later confirmed by the Chief Engineer of the Bahrein American Petroleum Company who are now undertaking extensive building operations. Local Construction Methods I have already referred to these in the General Conditions ouc briefly until recent years all building methods were controlled by the availability of a few local materials plus imports of .cement, mangrove poles and timber. The existing houses are divided into three classes (a) Permanent type built with coral walls finished with 2 ins. laminated coral slabs in order to provide a flush finish. Usually the floors and ceilings are constructed of mangrove poles approximately 5 ins. in diameter and placed about 8 ins. apart, covered with palm fronds and finished with three to four inches of concrete. For insulation purposes the roofs are also covered with two or three inches of mud, but although the rainfall in Bahrein only amounts to an inch or two a year all the houses apparently leak like sieves. Windows and doors are of timber, usually imported from India, which despite the adverse climatic conditions seems to weather very well. (b) Mud Huts. The roofs in this case are covered with the usual palm fronds and mangrove poles. (c) Barastis. These were originally built and occupied during ohe summer by all classes of Arabs, for the type of construei/ior is such that during the hot weather they^are much cooler than the more permanet type of houses (see (a) and (b) above). Some of the more soundly constructed barastis are however occupied throughout the year by the poorer classes although there is no protection against the weather and the conditions at times must be appalling. Contractors I am convinced that there are no local contractors who are capable of carrying out good class work, even with our assistance, but fortunately as Holloway Bros, are undertaking the new water scheme previously referred to, I surest that they be approached in London to ascertain whether they are interested in our project and would be willing to tender. Other possibilities are Costains who are doing work in Bahrein and Wimpeys in Kuwait. As the Public Works Department of India have proved so hopeless I have arranged for local contractors T. Thominna and S. Uchi (who are of Iraqi origin and in war time did work for the Army) to be responsible for all future maintenance and maintenance works in connection with the existing Laval buildings which we occupy at Jufair. Materials Everything will have to be imported except Gatch (plaster), Sana and Ballast. (Signed) Turner.

It will almost certainly be convenient for the F.A. to the P.R. to live in the Residency proper. C.O. and M.O. total 16 clerks and it has been found in practice that on an average 3 in each office, totalling 6, of those are married and the remainder bachelors at any one time. separate quarters or flats are recuired for the married clerks. Bachelors prefer as a rule to live in a Mess, i.e. separate sleeping quarters and a common living room and dining room. With the present division into Anglo-Indian and Indians, two such Messrs would need to be provided, accommodating 3 eanh. (iii) Dispensary ; This should accorarrodate the despensary staff as well as the technical rooms, consisting of Medical Inspection room Dispensary Storeroom public Works Staff ; provision should be made for 2 married clerks and 3 bachelors. (v) Maintenance; These men will be in status and pay inferior to the clerks but superior to menials and transport. They will require accommodation of approximately 2 rooms each, with bathroom, lavatory and kitchen, and room to erect a purdah if married. (vi) Transport ; These men will probably prefer to live in Barastis - each having a two-roomed barasti hut in its own barasti enclosure. ('vii') Menials; Head-farrash and Head-sweeper should have two-roomed barasti as an (vi ) f while the rest could have one-roomed barasti. Washermen should have a separate large barasti, with washing pits, oven and drying lines. (viii) Guard: They should have a two-roomed guardroom bear the gate, one room for the Havildar and another larger room for the constables, with separate bathroom, lavatories and kithen.

E3 London, S.E.l 18th June 1947 Many thanks for your letter of 17th J une enclosin g further letter from Hay regarding^authority for expenditure on repairs to buildings on the Arab shore of the Persian Gulf. I feel myself a little at sea in the intricacies of IndAa-^ffioa accounting procedure, but we are quite agreeable to recommend that authority should be given to spend up to £900 on minor repairs to the Residency this year. Up to the end of this financial year, i.e. to March the 31st next, it is for you to authorise the expenditure. Our system of accounting, which will cane into force an April 1st 1948, from which date we shall bear the cost, appears to be somewhat different from yours. Under our system a circular is sent out to all posts, in response to which the incumbents give details and estimates of all their requirements during the year. In due course when the Estimates have been settled a reply is sent to them by the Architect (in this case Mr. Turner, Cairo) informing them what has been approved and giving instructions as to how the work should be put in hand. The regulations are set out in the attached Foreign Office paper, which you will also find printed on page 113 . et seq of the current Foreign Office List.

Dear Donaldson, V LA I 3 in MINISTRY OF WORKS, r n Lambeth Bridge House7 J Albert Embankment, ( 3 London, S.E.l \0^ February, 1947. \ » . L U _ Yf A. SI *1*. I have now received our engineers 1 report on. the air- ^nditioning scheme for the haval. Buildings at B ahrein. # , fortunately the Admiralty were not aoie to provide the technical v . tails of the plant which they had installed and which Colonel Hay wished to use. The report is therefore only in general teiros. Colonel Hay’s scheme is for three installations. That for the office building involves the use of the present air- conditioning plant. It is impossible to say, without full details of the plant (including the design capacity of all the components; whether this scheme would be effective. But prima fade, it seems strange that the Admiralty should install an equipment capable of air-conditioning twice the volume for which it was utilised. It may be, however, that Colonel Hay does not intend to condition some of the ground floor rooms or that the Admiralty ran the plant at half power on the grounds of economy. The scheme for the Secretary's residence and that of the Residency Surgeon, involves the use of a 12 ton plant left by the Admiralty* The use of this plant will necessitate about 200 feet of external air ducting involving a large heat gain and this is likely to prove most uneconomical. It might be possible to employ some other system with this plant but this would involve the acquisition of other components, not readily obtainable. In normal circumstances we would not recommend this ducting scheme. The scheme for the Resident's own house is for the purchase of certain Carrier room cooling unite* Those proposed are of suitable size and the price seems reasonable. In my letter of iftl^ -the 12th. I said that we had certain units in our stores but as we I ; have no particulars of the electricity supply in Bahrein we cannot say if they would be suitable. Moreover, they are very much smaller than those proposed, and a greater number of them would be required. This would not be a satisfactory arrangement. We cannot be certain that there is an adequate water supply for the proposed units nor whether the electricity*sttpply can take the* ■ extra load which these units would cause* The plant in the office Buildingbuilding runs off its own generator and it is likely that the other plant, is similarly powered. Another point regarding the . load caused by the rocm-units is the cost' of the current consume' .*e have no knowledge of the cost of electricity in Bahrein but . these units take 1 unit of electricity per ton per hour, i*e, 84 units per day assuming each unit to operate 12 hours per day. Apart from the cost of running the generator-powered plants, the size of the scheme will necessitate the employment of two full time trained men for operation and running maintenance. You will appreciate that the running costs of the total scheme will therefore be very high, . ' t ■ &gt; . . • ,j : .. 3 Another financial consideration is that the units which it is proposed to purchase are of American manufacture and their purchase presumacly involve dollar expenditure, My own suggestion is that the rooms to be conditioned in the Residents house should be restricted to the living room and one bedroom. There are also many other items which should be carried out if this scheme is to proceed e.g. insulation of roofs, close fitting windows and air-locks etc. These will involve building work but they are essential for effective air-conditioning. Generally speaking, air-conditioned rooms should be air-tight. 0 We ar ® doubtful whether this scheme can be carried out for less than £J&gt;,000 and I am afraid that we can give no definite opinion without fuller details. If in these circumstances the Treasury are unwilling to allow the scheme, as proposed, to proceed you should ask Hay to obtain from the engineer of Petroleum Concessions Limited full detailed plans and estimates and submit these for our further study. He should also obtain an undertaking from the Company that they will permit their engineer to supervise the installation of the equipment and its subsequent maintenance.

We hare no knowledge of the cost of electricity in Bahrein but these units take 1 unit of electricity per ten per hour, i.e. 64&gt; units per day assuming each unit to operate 12 hours per day. Apart from the cost of running the generator-powered plants, the size of the scheme will necessitate the ea$ioy ent of two full time trained men for operation and sunning maintenance. You will appreciate that the running costs of the total sone e will therefore be very high. Another financial consideration is that the units which it is proposed to purchase are of American manufacture and their purchase will presumably involve dollar expenditure* Ky own suggestion is that the rooms to be conditioned in the resident'a house should be restricted to the living room and one bedroom. There are also many other items which should be carried out if this scheme is to proooed e.g. insulation of roofs, close fitting windows and air-looks etc. These will involve building work but they are essential for effective air-conditioning. Generally speaking, air-conditioned rooms should be air-tight. • * - . • We are doubtful whether this scheme can be carried out for leas than .3,000 and I am afraid that we oan give no definite opinion without fuller details. If in these oiroumstanoes the Treasury are unwilling to allow the scheme, as proposed, to proceed you should ask Hay to obtain free the engineer of Petroleum Concessions Limited full detailed plans and estimates and submit these for our further study.

I have delayed this reply to your letter of the 5th regarding Bahrein in the hope of being able to include the comments of our engineers on the scheme of air-conditioning put forward by the Political Resident, but I regret to say that these heye not yet\ aiVived. The engineers have had to-obtain from the Admiralty-certain technical details of the plant to v/hich Colonel Hay refers, as they find it impossible to give a considered opinion on air-conditioning schemes without full details of the plant involved. Colonel Hay is probably mainly concerned over the ordering of the room-units for his own residence lest they cannot be delivered in time for the next hot season. However we have in store here, a certain number of similar units i v/hich we could send out to Bahrein if *the engineers find that the \ type we possess are suitable. &lt; Our general principle of financial responsibility in the Persian gulf is that we shall take such liability only for the permanent scheme, until April 1st 1948, and we will therefore not be responsible for the expenditure on this air-conditioning scheme. However as the room units for the Political Residency are portable and could be used in any other post for which we are responsible, I feel that we might bear the cost of these units on our Vote. As regards the question of the site, I have fortunately had an opportunity to discuss the matter with our Architect in Cairo who has been on a brief visit to London. Mr. Turner tells me that he will be able to make a. visi t t,n rtehryn n vjj tMn the next four- weeks and he is ..therefore to get in touch with the Political Resident as soon as he gets back to Cairo. This will probably mean that the site question can be settled in about two months time and I am aski ng^ the Air Ministry to hold up the sale of their property until we reach such a decision.

Colonel Hay, who has just left on tour, has asked me to send you the estimates for servants* quarters men tioned in paragraph 3 of his letter. For a number of reasons, including the fact that the type of construction proposed for these quarters is one very well Ifnown locally, and that the estimate prepared by the Public Works Department office appeared unduly high, it is proposed to have this work done under contract. All the leading local contractors were approached and the tender of which a copy is enclosed repre sents the most satisfactory bid. As already indicated, this is substantially cheaper than the preliminary estimate for this work prepared by the Public Works Department; and it is also inclusive of the elements of carriage and supervision which have hitherto (cf. 4 and 5 of the previous estimates) been charged separately. 3. It is proposed for the moment to erect four blocks of quarters, which, at the rate of Rs.2,900/- per block, will amount to a total of Ks.11,600/-. More quarters than this will probably be required; but taking into account the time which must elapse, before His Majesty*s Government*s sanction for this work is received and the work can be started, it seems unlikely that more than four blocks can be completed during the current financial year, and any further quarters needed will therefore be included in the survey promised in , / paragraph 6 of Colonel Hay*s telegram No.1452 dated December &lt;7**7 Itb . 24 th »__lQ.4£L&gt; 4. As stressed by Colonel Hay, the works included in this and the preceding estimates are essential; and we should like to start on them as soon as possible, both on account of their urgency and in order to ensure that they are completed before the end of this financial year. It is earnestly hoped therefore that sanction for these works will not be delayed. E. P.

Tenvporary Accommodation for Political Resident at Bahrein 1. ’Then it was decided at the beginning of last year to move the Persian G-ulf Residency from Bushire to Bahrein, the only suitable buildings available on the island were the offices of the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, who it had recently been decided should go afloat. It was, therefore, agreed with the admiralty that the Jufair Naval Base buildings should be made available to the Political Resident, with the proviso that should they once more be required by the Admiralty (as a result of an emergency) they would immediately be made available. 2. The existing buildings required considerable modification before they wore suitable for the Residency, and the plans for the alterations were drawn up and the work is being performed by the Indian P. .AD. on an agency basis ior H.ii,G. who are bearing the whole cost. The Political Resident has sent three separate estimates for various works (see .Appendix; at a total estimated cost of about Rs.50,000 or £3&gt;750. The works thus undertaken are said to be a bare minimum. 3. Tiiree separate amounts of A,000 have been sanctioned to the Political Resident (on October Nth, November Rtn and November 30th) leaving A ?50 uncovered oy financial sanction from H.li.G. The works which this sanctioned sum of A3,000 was intended to cover were not specified, but it appears that all the work noted in-tie i^pendix is paid for by the A3,000 already sanctioned wita the exception of a sum of Rs.10,000 or about £750 required for the provision of servants’ quarters. A. A further request has also been received from the Political Resident ior permission to instal air-conditioning in certain of the buildings at a cost of apparently not less than £1,500. Detailed estimates have, however, not yet been received. 5. Up to now no definite decision has been taken os to which Department should bear the expense of this work on its Vote. The first £1,000 sanctioned was to be borne on the India Office Vote, and the two further sums of £1,000 were sanctioned on the same conditions, so that the total ^ seems debitable to that Vote. At the moment the work is being undertaken on an agency basis by the P. AD. and in the annexure to the draft despatch we are intending to propose to the Government of India that this arrangement should continue until the ministry of Jorks are able to take over, which should be not later than 1st April, 1943. As from the latter date it is expected that control in the Gulf will be exercised by the Foreign Office so that the ministry of Porks will presumably carry all expenses concerned with what will then be Foreign Office buildings on its Vote. In the circumstances it might be considered appropriate that the Ilinistry of .orks should take immediate control so as to ensure continuity of interest. If, however, the expense is to be borne on the India Office Vote, it w ill be necessary, sincu that Office is not technically competent of itself to scrutinise Public Porks accounts, either to delegate powers to the Political Resident within a certain limit of expenditure, or to refer his proposals in each case to the Ministry of .orks for technical advice. (The Political Resident's proposal for the installation of air—conditioning is a matter on i/hich the advice of the ministry of Porks must clearly be obtained.) Permanent Residency t o be built for the Political Resident at Bahrein As the Admiralty have insisted that the Political Resident’s tenancy of tne Naval base at Jufair can be considered to be a temporary measure only, it is desirable to proceed with the minimum of delay with plans for the provision of a permanent Residency at Bahrein. The Ministry of Porks have agreed that the cost of this scheme' should be borne on ineir Vote, especially as it is now certain that the post will ultimately be taken over by the Foreign Office. They are unable, however, to send anyone out to Bahrein at / /presentpresent to inspect sites. Leanv/hile the Political Resident has e^lced the India Office to approacn the air ministry to asl: thc.t the sale to the A.I.O.C. of certain R.;..r. lend (which may ta suitable as a site for the Residency) may be deferred until a decision is reached as to a site for the new Residency. This would appear to be the responsibility of the ministry of forks. ^• ^.a intenance of the ,meoncy huildinas at Bahrein, ^ov/eit, 'muscat, etc . ./hen those are taken over from the 'hovermeant of India. Inc buildings in which the three Politic.:.! ..-.goncios are housed are ownod and maintained by the Government of Indi tnougn H.m.G. has from time to time paid certain aaounts towards their upkeep, particulairy in the case of -oweit ’..here the whole of the expenditure is divisible between H.iu.G. and the Government of India. ..lien administrative control is transferred to H.R.G. tnc buildings v/ill have to be taken over from the Gover:merit of India at a valuation (bearing in mind the extent to which Imperial Revenues can be said t d nave contr^outed to ihe ir purchase or maintenance in the pe^t) and the maintenance of them will then be a responsibility of H....G, It will, however, be necessary for some agency of h.m.G. to inspect the buildings oci ire they are umken over .no decide what is required. This will presumably have to be undertaken by the ministry of r orks. .nen cmtrol in the Gulf becomes the responsibility of the Foreign Chi ice, as It is noped /.ill be the case after 1st xipril, 1948, the maintenance of chose ouilumgs will prosum .bly automatically devolve on the ministry of .lOr.xS ..s oeing bhc department responsible for all Foreign Office buildings, a o decision a ns , no.‘/ever, been taken as to who shall be responsible in the interim period. From the point of view of continuity of control, it would see u d o. simplest that the ministry of .orks should assume responsibility forthwith. If, however, this is impracticable the India Office would, as i. i l ne case of tne t^mporai'y Residency, endeavour to arrange for tine work to be do.io by uhe Indian ± ....L). on an .agency basis, a fixed grant for the purpose being provided in the Political Resident's budget so that no reference home on small items of expenditure will be required. Such expenditure would, during this period, fall on the India Office Vote in common vita the general expenditure in the Gulf.Alterations to the . xiasc, Jufc.ir / * The political Aesident has from time to time submitted estimates for the following works in connection with the alterations to the Naval Base at Jufair.

January, 19V7 Dear D on, *&amp;ip I am sorry that it has been possible to make arrangements I*or someone to visjLt Bahrein to advise on a site for a permanent Residency, and X am afraid that a visit is unlikely in the near future. Our professional staff in Cairo who would normally be celled upon to visit that area are heavily pressed at the present time and a visit to Bahrein would mean postponing other work of an urgent character whichcannot in fact be postponed; and for similar reasons a visit in the near future cannot be arranged fron here. The solution,of course, is to increase the numbers of our professional staff engaged on overseas work but pressure of other work rules this out for the present at least. We are pursuing the question however and we shall not lose sight of the need for a visit to Bahrein as soon as this can be arranged. I see from your letter to Winnifrith of the 2nd January that you have suggested that responsibility for the temporary arrangements at Bahrein and the maintenance of the other Persian &gt;0 G-ulf Agency buildings should^in addition to responsibility for the permanent Residency be taken over as soon as possible by ^ e Ministry of Works. * Our views on this suggestion are ntained in the enclosed copy of a letter which I an sending to aser.

H/ the 7th January, 1947. As mentioned in paragraph 6 of my telegram No. 1452, dated 24th December, 1946, about funds for building at Jufair, I have been examining the question of providing the minimum essential amount of air- conditioning for the buildings here. 2. In view of the temporary nature of our occupation of these premises, restriction of air- conditioning to the minimum is clearly essential. I am, however, convinced of the necessity for air-conditioning the principal offices and living quarters. The general desirability of air-conditioning under conditions in the Persian Gulf is now accepted, and the climate here in Bahrain is one of the most trying in the Gulf; all the principal commercial firms either have air-conditioning or are contemplating installing it, and they find that it pays handsome dividends in increased efficiency during the summer; and I am sure that a decision to postpone all attempts at air-conditioning here till the future was more settled would prove false economy, particularly as - as I hope to show below - we should, by making the best use of existing facilities, be able to provide an effective installation at a relatively small cost. 3. The buildings that I v/ould propose to air- condition are ; - (a) the offices .... E. P. Donaldson, Esquire, C.M.G., India Office, London.(d) . EX L . tL- ri page 2, rw) (a) the offices (b) f and my gazetted officers; ,, j — I the principal rooms in my residence; (c) the principal rooms in my Secretary's and Under Secretary's residences; these are both in one building; the principal rooms in the Residency Surgeon's quarters. I give below my proposals for these buildings separately, These offices are situated on the top floor of the Confidential Office building. The bottom floor of this building, formerly the Naval W/T receiving room and now my confidential office, is already air-conditioned. I am advised that the machine supplying air-conditioning to this bottom floor is sufficiently powerful to air-condition the top floor as well without loss of efficiency, and all that will be required therefore is the installation of air- conditioning ducts to lead the cooled air from the bottom floor to the rooms above. (b) Owing to its somewhat diffuse design, my residence is not suited to air-conditioning as a single unit. The four principal rooms which I wish to air-condition - drawing room, dining room and two bedrooms - can however be effectively served by single units of suitable size in each room. The units required would be one 2i ton and three l-§ tons, and I can arrange locally to order these in time to have them installed before the hot weather sets in, provided that an order is placed without delay. They would not, of course, be permanent fixtures, and in the event of our moving house later could either be removed and installed somewhere else or transferred on suitable terms to our successors here. 6 * ( c ) a ^d (d) These two buildings are adjacent, and so placed that a single sufficiently powerful unit placed between them, with ducting leading off to each, could air- condition them • • • •page 3. r O i condition them very economically ana efficiently. It so happens that the apparatus handed over to us by the Navy includes a 12-ton air-conditioning unit which has sufficient capacity to do this work effectively; and the only expense involved in air-conditioning these two buildings would therefore be the installation of the machine in a simple house, sufficient to protect it against the weather and interference, and the provision of the necessary ducting. 7. Petroleum Concessions, Limited, are engaged on an extensive air-conditioning programme for the execution of which they have brought out a special air-conditioning engineer. I have reason to believe that they would raise no objection to our borrowing the services of this engineer for the installation of our plant; and indeed these present proposals are the result of informal consultation with him. We should of course have to retain on the premises an electrician capable of doing routine maintenance and repair work on these machines; Petroleum Concessions, Limited, would assist us in major repairs. But as I have already mentioned to you separately, we are at present maintaining an electrician who is work-charged to the Jufair buildings account, but who I shall shortly recommend should be taken on permanently to assist inter alia in looking after the telephone system and other electrical installations left here by the Navy; he will be available, after training by Petroleum Concessions, Limited, to assist in the installation of the plant and afterwards to look after it; and this will not therefore represent an extra expense. 8. The preparation of estimates for this work will entail calculations as to the exact amount of ducting involved, etc. This is an expert job for which the services of Petroleum Concessions, Limited’s engineer will be necessary. Before I make • • • •page 4. o Petroleum Concessions, Limited, however, I should like to know that His Majesty*s Government approve of the general lines I propose to follow. Apart from this, it is essential that the units required for my residence - cf. paragraph 5 supra - should be ordered at once if they are to arrive in time : the units I have in mind are Carrier machines and their total cost, at prices at present quoted, will be about £ 1,135 delivered at Bahrain. I should therefore be grateful if you could let me have as soon as possible by telegram His Majesty's Government's concurrence in my general proposals, and their sanction to my placing orders for these four units. I will then proceed to enlist the assistance of Petroleum Concessions, Limited, and will have estimates prepared and submitted for formal sanction. G.A.M.CONFIDENT lii 1 ^ ii l3iSB3» D.O, No. 69 - S.

I think the proposal in the draft letter to Winnifrith is the best that can be devised under the circumstances. We in this Office are clearly not in a position to examine adequately the detailed estimates for buildings, etc., in Bahrein, whereas the Ministry of Works have the technical staff available for the purpose. I do not imagine there would be much difficulty in the e;jqpenditure being borne by the Ministry of Works on their Vote, but if the expenditure already sanctioned is to be borne on the India Office Vote for this year it will be necessary for us to obtain a Supplementary, and the closing date by which Supplementaries have to be submitted to the Treasury is already past. Consequently it is a matter of some urgency to obtain a decision from the Treasury. '/'A 7London, S' LI. would you plew.se re Per to tie Copy to:- R. .

Military Branch I, Admiralty, S. W. 1. M. 01019/46. /3 December, 1946. Dear Harrison, At your meeting on the 24th October, there was some discussion of possible sites for a new Residency for the Political Resident at Bahrein. I was asked whether it would be possible for part of the Naval site at Jufair to be used for this purpose. 2. With the Naval Base at its present size, there would probably be no difficulty in finding room for the Residency on the Naval site. The present Naval buildings are scattered over about two thirds of the total area, the remainder being open ground. 3. The difficulty is, however, that we cannot guarantee that in the circumstances in which we should have to take over our buildings from the Political Resident we should not have to expand the Base beyond its wartime size. In that event, it would be very awkward if the obvious area for expansion had already been taken up by the Political Resident. 4. On the whole, therefore, we should prefer the political Resident to avoid this site. If, however, it is immeasurably the best of those available, we might be able to consider letting him have it, but we should like to see the plans for the Residency before the work is started. Will this be inconvenient to you, or are the plans more or less standard whatever the site? Yours sincerely, F. A. K.Harrison, Esq. , India Office, S.W. 1.

You will remember that at the meeting held here on October 24th, part of the discussion was concerned with the provision of.a permanent Residency for the Political Resident at Bahrein in view of the fact that the .Admiralty were only able to permit use to be made of the Naval buildings there on a temporary basis. We then agreed to take steps as soon as possible to secure a Ministerial decision on the question whether the Foreign Office or Colonial Office vote should eventually bear the cost of maintaining the Resident and his establishment, since upon this decision appeared to depend, inter alia, the question which department should deal with the provision of a permanent Residency. 2. You will now have seen a note of the meeting at the India Office on November 6th (at which the Ministry of Works were represented by Patrick) as a result of which a memorandum is being sent round for submission to Ministers, recommending that, for the present, the India Office should remain the department responsible for the Political Residency (and subordinate Agencies) and that the expenditure involved should be borne on the India Office vote; the draft memorandum adds that while it is felt better to leave open for the present the question as to which Department shall eventually undertake the responsibility, the balance of opinion, at the official level, is inclined at the moment to favour the Foreign Office rather than the Colonial Office. 0 * 3.

Dear Donaldson, Witn reference to your letter of the 4th November, we have now examined the estimates and plans for the conversion of some of the Naval buildings at Bahrein for the use of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. We think the proposed alterations are sound, and the price very reasonable. We recommend, therefore, that the work should proceed on the lines proposed at the estimated cost quoted.

Croft (in the Chair) Mr. W.A.J. Marshall (Treasury) Mr. I.P. G-arran (Foreign Office) Mr. A.J. Gardener (Foreign Office) Mr. J.M. Martin (Colonial Office) Sir B. Reilly (Colonial Office) Mr. Trafford Smith (Colonial Office) Mr. K.L. Stock (Ministry of Fuel &amp; Povver) Mr. G.C.B. Dodds (Admiralty) Lt.Col.J.G. Atkinson (War Office, M.0.4) Mr. M.W. Lot/ (Air Ministry) Capt. L. Byrde (Ministry of Civil Aviation) Mr. G.M. Patrick (Ministry of Works) Col, j'.R. Hay (Political Resident in the Persian Gulf) Mr. E*P. Losaldsan (inula Office) Mr. R.S. Braun (India Office) Mr. R.A. Janes (India Umce) Mr. F.A.K. Harrison (India Office) Sir William Croft referred to the: note which had been circulated by the India Office before the meeting. Chile it was clear that major political matters arising in the Persian Gulf would in any case remain under the control of the Foreign Office, there seemed to be three possible alternative arrangements for future administration:- (a) for the India Office to retain control, so long as it existed in its present form, taking over the administrative functions formerly performed by the Government of India; or (b) for the Foreign Office, or (c) the Colonial Office, to take over control and to provide for the discharge of the administrative functions in question. On the face of it, the most convenient arrangement might seem to be for the India Office to retain control, for the interim period, but the Treasury had raised certain objections. 2. Sir William Croft explained that the administrative functions included public works (the question of' provision of accommodation for the Political Resident was of immediate importance), the setting up of a separate postal system, lighting and buoying, currency, quarantine arrangements, and the performance of judicial functions by the political officers in the Gulf. Another question of major importance which would have to be considered was the provision of personnel for the staffing of the Gulf posts. These had hitherto been supplied by the Indian Political Service and the officers concerned would presumably continue to belong to that Service until it was wound up, in perhaps a year or two's time, and meanwhile remain on present /conditions/6. conditicLik and rates of pay. - 2 - 3. Mr. laarshall (Treasury) explained that the Treasury objections to the proposal that the India Office should retain control for the time being and that the expenditure should be placeo on the India Office vote were:- (a) the untidy accounting arrangements thereby involved; and (b) that the department which was ultimately to bear responsibility might be prejudiced by decisions in which it had no say being taken during the interim period, e.g. regarding personnel. In discussion it was suggested that the interim period would probably last at least until India's future status had been determined. Colonel Hay said that until the Indian Political Service was dissolved, .election of personnel would not be necessary. 4. Mr. G-arran (Foreign Office ), said that, on political grounds, the Foreign Office thought that it was more satisfactory that they should take over the whole administration in due course. Although the Foreign Office had no administrative service, as such, the functions of the political officers were not unlike those that had been performed by Consular officers in Sgypt and Persia, 5. Mr. Oar den er added that the Foreign Service was in process of re-organisation and the Foreign Office were not in a position to assume the administrative responsibilities at the moment. He thought that the Foreign Office would allow the present officers to carry on as hitherto under the Government of India unii! the Indian Services were wound up ant would then take these officers on on a contract basis. As regards administrative matters such • s the Postal Service, Mr. Gardener thought that the Foreign Office coult obtain the personnel to run this, but he agreed that they had not the background to supervise the running of such a service, 6. For the Colonial Office , Mr. Martin said that his observations were made on the understanding that the purpose of the meeting was to consider the various aspects of the question with a view to a submission being made to Ministers. The Colonial Secretary hac not yet expressed a view. . As against the Colonial Office taking over the responsibility there were- the following considerations:- (a) Many of the questions of moment in the Persian Gulf were already handled by the Foreign Office. (b) The Colonial Office had not been much concern&gt;-.d with oil politics which were of particular importance in the Persian Gulf. (c) He wondered how the acceptance of responsibility by the Colonial Office would be regarded by the Sheikhs themselves and v/hether it would be objected to by the H.S.A. and the U.d.S.R. as an extrusion of British Imperialism.- 3 - 8. On the other hand, in favour of the Colonial Office taking over responsibility were the following considerations:- The Colonial Office had the means to take it over at once. Administration in the Sheikhdoms would be similar to that already undertaken by them in other parts of the Colonial Empire. They had the technical experts, e.g. in medicine, education and in welfare work generally ( Colonel Hay confirmed that with the new influx of wealth from oil development there was a large field for material and welfare developments; the Rulers welcomed our assistance in such matters). As regards the question of the India Office accepting responsibility in the interim period Mr. Martin thought there need be no particular difficulty as long as the Colonial Office were kept in touch with long-term policy. The Colonial Office could, from their own services, supply men for particular posts as vacancies arose. 9. Sir William Croft thought that it would probably not be necessary to introduce officers from the Colonial Service while tho Indian Services were still in existence. As regards the continued employment of the present members of the Indian Political Service, he suggested that the compensation they might expect to receive on the disbandment of the Indian Services would probably make it possible for such officers to continue employment under the Colonial Office on rates less high than present I.P.S. scales. He thought, himself, that there would be some advantage in maintaining a state of fluidity for a time. It was impossible to say for how long the ' interim period' Y/ould last, perhaps for two or three years or more or what developments there ight be in J he meantime. He then asked the representatives of other departments present to give their views. 10. Mia Lav; said that it was really immaterial to the ^ir Ministry whether the Foreign Office or the Colonial Office eventually took over. I 11. The Ministry of Works representative said that they v/ere only interested from the point of view of buildings. On this point Mr. Marshall said that the Treasury would have no objection to the India Office supervising the provision of tempercry buildings and putting the expenditure on the India Office vote, the work being done on an agency f basis by the Indian P.W.D. 12. The .ministry of Civil Aviation representative mentioned the probable sei sitivity of the Arab League and the U.S. Government on the subject. In view of this and the international aspect of the Civil Air Agreements with the Sheikhs he would be inclined to favour the Foreign Office as the eventual heir. Colonel Hay explained that the Rulers concerned had no relations with the Arab League. They would probably prefer to be dealt with by a department of H.M.G. which was not responsible for H.M.G’s relations with their great neighbours, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, of v/hom they were apprehensive. He v/as not, however, sure what the Sultan of Muscat's attitude would be. -‘-3. The Admiralty representative thought that the responsibility should remain with the India Office for the interim period. In view of the Foreign Office concern with neighbouring territories, he was inclined to think that they should be the eventual heirs. - 4. Mr. Stock said that the Ministry of Fuel and Power v/ere concerned in view of the vital importance of the Persian Gulf as a major source of oil supplies. His Ministry would be very reluctant to see any hiatus /ofA - ■v of administration, particularly as some difficult problems of major importance were now loci.dng up. He thought that the present arrangements whereby the India Office exercised supervision worked well in practice, and that any change should only be introduced gradually. 15. The Y. r ar Office representative had no comments. 16. Sir William Croft thought that the point made by Mr. Stock was important. Any hiatus should clearly be avoided, and the Foreign Office were evidently not in a position to take over at once. Mr. Marshall said that the Treasury had not realised that the Foreign Office were not in such a position, and that this was clearly a relevant point, 17. Chairman sunrning up, said that there appeared to be general agreement that the India Office should carry on for the present (subject to the Treasury objection being withdrawn) but that it v/as desirable to know which department would eventually take over. It seemed to be the general view that the responsibility should eventually pass to the Foreign Office rather than to the Colonial Office but the matter ?/ould have to be decided by Ministers. A memorandum would presumably have to be submitted to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India, and it was agreed that such a paper might, as the next stex-), drafted by the India Office and referred in c raft to the other departments primarily concerned for comments before submission to the Secretary of State for India. India Office, S.W.l. 8th November, 1946.l$K 7A&lt; ■ Mr. Harrison. The Admiralty propose to charge us no rent for buildings, furniture and equipment at Bahrain as they regard our occupation as being in the nature of an encroachment. I understand, hov.ever, that ine Treasury have not yet been consulted regarding this proposal. I should be grateful if an early decision could be communicated to me. If rent is demanded its fixation especially so far as furniture and equipment are concerned will be a matter of extreme difficulty. It will be much simpler if we can be regarded as caretakers on behalf of the Admiralty, and charged no rent. I sh6u’ ' 1 for a copy of this note. (S g u.) .R• da 6/11“Vy^ no. V^ill you please refer to India Office telegram 17850, dated the 3rd October, 1946 ? 2. I enclose herewith plans (tracing copies) and copies of estimates for the alterations to the Naval buildings. 3. With regard to these, Pelly, who has been supervising the work, notes as follows : - '‘The estimates and plans were framed according to our ideas of June last as to how the accommodation should be allotted. When we actually got the majority of the staff over here and (the Navy having left) got a more detailed acquaintance with the buildings, it became necessary to make some modifications in the original proposals. The following comments explain these and the present state of the various works : - (References are to 'Summary' 1 of Estimates). 1. Converting Officers Cabin Block into residences for the Under Secretary, Assistant Secretary and Personal Assistant to the Political Resident. Although it has now been decided that this block should be occupied by the Residency Surgeon and Under Secretary, only few modifica tions will be made in the original proposals v/hen carrying out the work. Work on the kitchens is 75 % complete. It has not been possible yet to begin the rest of the work as the quarters have been occupied by the Confidential Office staff while their own are being prepared for them. 2. Converting Rating Block No. 1. Work on the first floor has begun and modifications have been made in the original estimate to give the centre flat more room at the expense of the four roomed flat to the right hand side of the plan. The original idea was to accommodate our Main Office (including Treasury, Record Room, Typistry, Des patch Branch, Treasury Officer and Superintendent *s rooms) in the ground floor of the Royal Naval Wireless Telegraph receiving room. This, however, was found far too cramped and the Main Office has had to be located in the ground floor of Ratings Block No. 1. The alterations shown to it in the plan will therefore not be required but, in order to convert it into adequate office accommodation, others will, e.g. the Treasury room will have to be strengthened and probably at least one of the large rooms divided up. 3. Converting Ratings Mess Block into two family quarters. This work has been nearly completed according to plan. 4. Converting Ratings Block No. 2 into quarters for six Confidential Office bachelors. This work has been completed according to plan except that no bathrooms have been built in the verandahs, the existing W. C's and showers being adapted for use.2 r— DdJ &gt; . 4R , 6. Benyorfring’Operators 1 Quarters . This work will be carried out as planned. It has not been possible yet to commence it since the quarters are occupied by one of the families who will ultimately live on the first floor of ’'Eatings Block No, 1” where work is at present in progress. Converting Guard House , This work has not yet begun, 8 &amp; 9. These estimates need no comment. 4. It will be observed that the only modifications involving any reductions in the cost of the original estimates have been made in Estimate No. 2, while these reductions .are set off by the fact that, instead of the original alterations pro posed for the ground floor, at least equally extensive altera tions will be required to convert it into offices; so that there is no likelihood of less than the original total of Rs 35,000/- being required for the works already proposed. In addition to them, funds will also be required for the following works (for which estimates have not yet been framed) : - (i) Alterations and repairs (mainly for security reasons) to the Confidential Office, situated in the previous Royal Naval wireless receiving and office building. (ii) Alterations and repairs to the Secretary^ quarters (this comprises four rooms only) in the previous ’’Captain’s Quarters”. (iii) Building an incinerator for the destruction of confidential papers, time-expired recyphering tables, etc. (iv) Building of a date frond hut with latrine for the police guard. (v) Alterations required for the Political Resident's Z five items quarters. These,/the Executive Engineer and I estimate, will not cost less than another Rs 15,000/-; so that the total cost of all alterations will not be less than Rs 50,000/-. 5. It should, I think, be pointed out that up to a few days ago our total Public Works Department staff amounted to one supervisor who was retained in service against his will after he had reached his date of retirement; he took about two months to collect the necessary labour and material even to commence work; it is not possible to complete each work by buildings within any reasonable time because plumbing, for example, with the staff at our disposal^takes a longer time than the masonry work and collection of the masonry labourers, etc. if dispersed after their job on a particular building is finished would be a lengthy procedure - they have therefore to be put in to work on another building. The £ 1,000/- sanctioned by the India Office is almost exhausted and unless the work is to stop sanction for the Rs 35,000/- shown as the total of these estimates should be obtained without delay. Many of the staff have been living under conditions of extreme discomfort for the last four months and these should not be unavoidably prolonged.V GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

The work haa already been taken in liand and the £1,000 wriich has been sanctioned has probably by this time been fully spent* If the further £2,000 or so which has been asked for is not sanctioned at an early date it means that the work will have to stop - some,of it in -an unfinished state - and that the labour employed will be dispersed. This will very likely lead tp additional expenditure when work is resumed. fne main essential is to provide' reasonably comfortable quarters for the Residency staff with the least possible delay. They have been removed from comfortable houses at Bushire go bare and uninviting barracks at Jufair. Apart from the general discomfort of the move and tne fact that they have now to serve in a place with a worse climate than Bushire and with no accessible hill-station they are disgruntled at the loss of the Customs allowance which they drew on Persian soil. There have already been one or two resignations and tnere will be more if everything reasonably possible is not done to make them comfortable in their new surroundings. The accommodation available for the staff at Jufair consists of single cabins and large barracks. The cabins are being converted into married quarters and the barracks into /bo tnboth married and single quarters. The work which is being uncertain consists largely of the provision of extra Datl&gt; ' r0 ? raS arld the erections of partition walls -ne expenditure involved is extremely modest. • Estimates and. plans have been called for and are expeeted to arrive by the end of this week. When they do - Ve 1 ^ 0uda that the ministry of ,»'orks should be ; asked to vet them and. the Treasury to provide tne tunas as a special case pending a final decision on the question of departmental responsibility. i3gd.^ V/.Hr ilay.

This left no doubt that it was necessary to contemplate building a p rmanont Residency with as little delay as possible• Mr. Barker said that estimates made in 1-937 had ruoted £130,0*0 as the estimated expenditure on a new building but that with increased prices, this figure might well have to be doubled to reach an estimate of the present cost oi building on tlm oCc..a.e ta^u contemplated. ; Colonel Hay said that the buildings he now contemplated woula not be on suite such a lavish scale as the pre-war plans. He thought that something on the linos of a bungalow-cemp witn ^.ir-conditioned rooms would be suitable for office and living accommodation. Some reception rooms would be required for official entertainment. This -would mean a groat reduction in the height of all the rooms ana in the area of many of them, and the cost would be correspondingly He thou 1 1 th t . .ir-conditioning was most important* He/ reduce d.Ho had four possible sites in udnd, one of uhioh v:as on land belong inf to the Navy, but could not say without expert advice ahich of thxe. ould bd tluo most suitable# He sue guested that it v.s desirable for an crchit-ct to be sent out as. soon as possible to make a survey# The present temporary arran -enent v;as better than nothing but a .s not satisfactory.

The Admiralty have always regarded the transfer of the I\aval Base at Bahrein to tie Political Resident as temporary. It is difficult to see how we could do otherwise. If there were ^a serious errergency or, worse still, a war involving tne Persian Guli, v^e should obviously require the only Naval shore establishment of any size which tie possess in that area. .7e must, to maintain our operational efficiency, reserve the right to re occupy at very short notice. If we had to specify a notice, we should say three months, but the figure is not real since we should hope to be able to give you more but might be driven to re occupy at very short notice indeed. j think we all agree that the Naval accommodation at Bahrein is not really suitable for the Political Resident on a long term basis. We understand that the construction of new accommodation was approved in principle in IQST in any case, and it therefore seems most desirable that you should lose no time in drawing up plans for a uermanent and fitting home for the Political Resident in Bahrein. We agree with you of course that it would be desirable, if^ -possible, to come to some mutually satisfactory arrangement for the accommodation of the Navy and the political Resident, if unhappily war were to break out before your new buildings could be put up; and we fiiould try to make do with part of the base for the time being. But for the reasons given above we cannot guarantee that we could share it in emergency and we are therefore anxious that you should lose no time in starting work on the new buildings. 5. If this work could be so arranged as to rehouse first those who are occupying the re ere at icmal buildings asked xor in Sir Henrjjr^ Markham’s letter to Sir David Monteath of the 17th April but ~ subsequently surrendered in response to Major Henderson’s appeal of the 29th May, it would suit us very well. 6. On the smaller points, we expect you, of course, to be responsible for and bear the cost of the maintenance of the buildings. We should ordinarily like to be consulted before structural alterations are carried out, but in the existing urgency, we should not wish to object to any alterations which the Political Resident considers essential, on the understanding that they are kept to a minimum. The cost of any such alterations would have to be met by you. As your tenure would be in the nature of an encroachment, v/e do not propose to ch arg e rent. 7 r— I am 'sending copies of this letter to Barker at the Ministry of Works, to Winnifrith at the Treasury and to Gaccia at the Foreign Office.

IJear Barker, Will you please refer to Winnifrith’s letter No.S.17497/5 of 4th October about the conversion of certain buildings of the naval base Bahrein for the use of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 2. I should explain that the background of this affair is that earlier in the year the Cabinet decided that the Headquarters of the Political Resident should forthwith be removed from Bushire in Persia where it has been situated for about 200 years, to Bahrein on the Arab side of the Gulf. There was no proper accommodation available for the Residency at Bahrein, but it so happened that the Admiralty had just decided that the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, whose headquarters had hitherto been situated at Jufair on Bahrein Island, should in future go afloat. They kindly offered to make certain buildings in the naval base available for the Political Resident as a temporary measure, retaining certain other buildings for their ov/n use. 3. While the Residency was at Bushire the Government of India were responsible for its upkeep and the maintenance expenditure was shared. They are, however, now most unlikely to be willing to continue this responsibility in respect of the new Residency at Bahrein and in any case in view of the constitutional developments in India the Cabinet have decided that H.M.G. should themselves undertake future responsibility for the administration under the charge of the Political Resident; this will of course include the provision and upkeep of the necessary administrative and living accommodation for the staff. 4. With regard to the Residency itself, there are now two problems to be considered:- (a) the adaptation for current use of the buildings in the naval base made available on a temporary basis by the Admiralty; and (b) the provision on a permanent basis of a new Residency at * 4 Bahrein. The most immediate problem is, of course the conversion of the Admiralty buildings, and the Political Resident has already been /authorised R.A, Barker, Esq,, M.V.O.authorised to go ahead with this, and spend up to £1 ,000 without prejudice to the ultimate incidence. I understand that he has prepared estimates and plans accordingly and the receipt of these from Bahrein is now awaited.

Your Reference Treasury Reference S...17497/5- 4 th October, 1946 Dear Donaldson, , ^ ^ Many thanks for your letter of 26th September EXT. 6509/46) about the conversion of certain buildings at ‘Bahrein. There are three main pointa so far as the Treasury are concerned. 1. Should H.M.G. or the Government of India bear this expenditure? We agree that almost certainly in che Tong run H.Ri.G. will have to be responsible, out in view oi the negotiations outstanding on this general switch of responsibilities,- we do not wish to make a present to the Government of India of our willingness to assume this liability. We think, therefore, that the arrangement should be that H.M.G. should defray the expenditure at the present time without prejudice to their right to make a claim in / the general negoti^ti ons in respect of this item / The/next point is as to which Department should beAssuming that the Foreign Office take over^esponsibility for these Missions as part of the Foreign Service, the cost of building and maintaining the accommodation at these posts,will, like that of all other Foreign Service Missions oversea^ iall on the Vote for Public Buildings overseas administered by the Ministry of Works. This Vote, incidentally, already bears half the cost of Bushire, and obviously ought to bear whatever expenditure on Bahrein falls on H.M.G. 3. The third point is whether the resident E.P.Donaldson, Esq., C.M.G. /should India Office.F/ should be allowed to roar ahead with his programme without any control from this end. Assuming that you agree with our contention that the Ministry^^ Works should be responsible, it seems to us that^' the Ministry of Works should at the earliest possible opportunity be brought into the picture and take charge of the building programme. With this in mind I am sending a copy of this letter to R.A.Barker of the Ministry of Works. I am also sending a copy to Caccia at the Foreign Office. Yours sincerely,IMPORTANT.

An answer is required fr?

I trust I shall be given as free a hand as possible so far as financial and other sanctions are concerned for the works it is necessary to undertake at the Jufair Naval Base in order to render the buildings suitable for occup ation by my staff. So far as I know the position is that the Executive Engineer can give technical sanction only up to Es. 10,000 and I can give administrative sanction only up to £#100 or Es. 1,30C/-* It is obviously necessary to get on with the viork quickly if the move is to be completed fcy the end of October or even by the end of November and unless I hear to the contrary I propose to do this and where necessary apply for ex^facto sanction. 3. So far as I can make out I can probably raise about Es. 60,000 from the final allotment for expenditure on *50-Civil Works-Central* 1 in the Persian Gulf during 1946-47. At some stage however I shall have to obtain formal sanction for the reappropriation of this money as the buildings in the Naval Base are not on the books of the Government of India. # 4. I will wire you 4he total estimated expenditure involved as soon as plans and estimates have been completed, I do not think the figure will be very high. 5. I have no idea on what terms the Admiralty are allowing us to use their buildings, fittings, furniture etc. at Jufair, but presumably this matter will be dealt with at leisure. bd/- W.R.

I now write to say that the Senior Naval ! Officer, Persian Gulf, has now agreed to the release of the W/T receiving station and offices l (Item 4); the Political Resident can also have the W/T transmitting station (Item 18), provided that care and maintenance of the equipment itself can be carried out by Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd. 3. I will write to you again in due course about the matters raised in paragraph 3 of your letter. I feel I should warn you, however, that we have from the first regarded the transfer of the accommodation as temporary (see our telegram 061151/June and my letter of the 6th June to you under thi&amp; reference). If there were serious trouble in the Persian Gulf we should almost certainly require at any rate part of the base, and we may have to reserve the right to go back at reasonably short notice.

Hay knew the result by telegram. On the issue raised in his d.o. letter, C/529 of the 24th July, attached, I take it that the India Office will follow up the point in paragraph 2 in regard to the R.A.P. land near the A.P.A.’s house. As for the question of the building of a new Residency, I am afraid that the Government of India can take no part in this, and it must be solely for H.M.G. to decide v/hether any new construction is to be undertaken or not. The necessity for new construction wdaiAl largely disappear if a perfectly clear-cut transfer of Admiralty property to the Residency is achieved. It is obviously impossible to maintain tise situation in which the Admiralty/Admiralty possess a continuing claim on the S.N.O.'s house and other property taken over by the Residency, if for no other reason than that quite considerable structural alterations will be necessary to make the buildings suitable for their new hous e-. .

We regard it as important that these buildings shuuld be transferred to the Political Resident rather than Cable and Wireless since the Political Resident has stated that they are essential to his plain for the accommodation of his staff. t/e ijust, therefore, I am afraid press you to give us a favourable decision in the matter, 3. With regard to the conditions of tenure on which tl&gt;e Admiralty are prepared to hand all these buildings in the Naval ^ase over to the Political Resident, we *aust point outnmLess you can offer us a reasonably secure basis of tenure it will be necessary for to proceed at once at great cost with the construction of an entirely new ' set of buildings for the Residency in Bahrein; the present arrangements for the taking over of the Naval Base being in that case regarded as a purely makeshift arrangement until/ G.G.B, Dodds, Esq,, Admiralty, S.W.1.until the permanent buildings can be brought into use. This will 9 of course, necessitate the natter being submitted to the Treasury. We recognise that you will probably require sone provision to be Made for the use of sone of the buildings in the event of a sudden emergency or war, but we would hope it should not be impossible to cone to so»e satisfactory arrangement to cover this.

Site for new Residency.r* D.O. No* C/416 Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* Camp Bahrain* 7 th July| 1946. As far as I know the Admiralty will only be willing to let us have the Naval Base at Jufair on lease and will probably insist on our undertaking to evacuate it at short notice should any serious emergency calling for Naval action arise in the Gulf. It is therefore essential to take up the question of building a Residency at Bahrain at once. 2. While I have been in Bahrain I have visited most of the sites previously suggested and have also inspected other sites. I consider the following four sites as possibilities i- (i) Budaiya. Cii) In the vicinity of Essex Point. (iii) In the vicinity of Jufair village. (iv) Immediately north of the house at present village. occupied by the Assistant Political Agent From a purely personal point of view I should prefer Budaiya to any of the other sites. It is open and healthy and there is plenty of room to build. It has hitherto not been seriously considered as being too remote but it is only 11 miles from Manama which is not so very much more than the 7 miles which separate Sabzabad from Bushire. It is I think desirable that the Political Resident should keep himself reasonably aloof from the main centres of population at Bahrain otherwise he will be liable to interfere with the work of the Political Agent. On the other hand its distance from the bazaar, clubs etc. at Manama will be an inconvenience to the staff. 4 . The Essex Point site has been strongly criticised by Prior vide his letter ^o. C/407 dated the I2th September, 1939, tman, Esquire, C*S^I., C.I*E., I.C.S., Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, New Delhi- 2 1939, and I myself consider the foreshore where the barrastis are situated too low-lying. I would also note that this site has palm gardens to the windward and is liable to suffer from mosquitos. This point was recognised at an early stage of the previous discussions vide letter No. W IV/^ll, dated the 9th November, 1936 from the Superintending Engineer, Aviation Circle, Central Public Works Department, to the Secretary to the Govern ment of India, Foreign and Political Department. On the other hand there are suitable sites on higher ground a little way inland from Essex Point the best of which is where the Petroleum Concessions Limited tennis court is situated. My chief objection to this is that the most attractive thing about Bahrain is the sea and that it would be a great pity to build a Residency which does not front on the sea. 5 . It would I think be possible to find a site near Jufair village which would front on the sea and catch the pre vailing winds. It would however be necessary to clear away a large number of palms and barrastis and even then it would be closely surrounded by habitations. \ 6 . If Budaiya is considered too remote the best site is probably that adjoining the Assistant Political Agent 1 a house. Most of the land here belongs to the Royal Air Force; they are not using it and would probably be ready to part with it. The main objection to this site is that it is practically inside lanama. 7 # I would emphasise the fact that it will be necessary not only to build the Residency and its offices but accommodation for the entire Residency staff. Arrangements should be made for air-conditioning from a central plant and in this case only comparatively small and low rooms would be required except say for two reception rooms in the Residency. 8 . There will presumably be considerable discussion between His Majesty's Government and the Government of India about the incidence of cost but I trust that action will not be delayedr / 3 on this account and would request that a qualified engineer may he deputed to Bahrain as soon as possible to inspect the sites and prepare rough plans and estimates. 9.

I hope you will feel that in the last part of the message we have gone a long way towards giving you the co-operation for which you asked. Yours sincerely, F.G.K.Harrison,Esg. , India Office, S.

HI, B.• 1 ) 17th April, 1946. My dear Monteath, Thank you for your letter of the 22nd March about S.N.O. Persian Gul^s accommodation at Bahrein; I am sorry not to have replied sooner but we have been considering how much of the accommodation ashore we shall still require when the S.H.O. goes afloat. The suggestion that the Political Resident might use this accommodation was made in a desire to help you in what promised, at any rate temporarily, to be a perplexing problem rather than in any great hope that it would be satisfactory. I enclose two plans from which you will see that the S.IT.O.’s residence is in the naval base at Jufair or Manamah Island. The site Sir David Monteath, K.C.B., K.C.M.G.,C.V.O. ,O.B.E. »u of the base, which amounts to 70 acres (excluding the 10i acres which comprise the Wireless Station) was purchased in 1934 and our title is equivalent to freehold. The residence itself is a one-storied building which, including a comparatively capaciOs verandah, measures only 1 3 1» x 52 \ 6 ”. it has a sitting room, a dining room, two bedrooms, dressing room, a kitchen and two bathrooms• There are of course other buildings in the naval base but whilst they might be suitable for offices and the other purposes you have in mind, X doubt if they will help you over the main hurdle, which I imagine is the accommodation in a fitting manner of the Political Resident himself. i«e shall probably require accommodation permanently for a Staff Officer (intelligence) and two other Europeans, a lay-apart store and workshop facilities for the ships of the Persian Gulf flotilla and accommodation and recreational facilities occasionally for part of the ships’ companies.Subject to that, you are very welcome V go use the 'buildings 'but my own feeling is that they will not he satisfactory. I understand that the Political Resident was to visit Bahrein in the early part of this month and you may hy now have heard his views.
