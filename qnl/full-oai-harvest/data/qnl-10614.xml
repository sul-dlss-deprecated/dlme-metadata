It includes four copies of a single page of notes on the boundaries of the Sultanate, dated January 1936 and prepared by the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat (ff 3-6), together with four versions of an accompanying sketch map showing the limits of the Sultanate (ff 7-10).The remainder of the file is mainly correspondence exchanged between the Political Agent and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, regarding whether or not certain locations fall within Muscat territory. One particular letter from the Political Agent to the Political Resident, dated 29 June 1944, provides details of what the Sultan of Muscat [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] considers to be the interior boundaries of Muscat (these are given as four sets of degree coordinates, which the Sultan is said to have received from a previous Political Agent, Major Ralph Ponsonby Watts).Included among the correspondence are two further sketch maps depicting the north-eastern tip of the Arabian Peninsula.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Sultanate of Muscat and Oman</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Arabian Peninsula</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000381#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000381#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
