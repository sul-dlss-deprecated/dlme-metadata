The Regent of Kalba, who came to Ajman on 27tli Jan uary, has sent me copies of certain correspondence between him and the Sultan of Muscat. These letters are as follows. ^ 3 # on 30th December 1940 the Sultan of Muscat wrote to Khalid and said that the small tower (nurabba f all) erected by Diba during the troubles and now in the course of completion should be removed. He also proposed that if in future the Shahuh made any trouble ( presumably a 0 ainst the people of Diba, though he does not specifically sayso ) the Govern ent of Muscat should be the sole arbitrator. 4 , Khalid replied to this on 6th January 1941 saying the (a) the tower was inside his territory (b) the VJali of Khasab had a reed to its being completed after the settler ant and (c; the Shahuh were very troublesome and declared war without a previous ultimatum. He therefore considered the building of the tower well within his rights and declined to dismantle it. 5 . This letter missed the Sultan of Muscat who had gone j to India and was received by the latter’s Foreign Secretary? who # asked Khalid on 16th January to keep the matter pending till the * Sultan’s return. Khalid re lied to this on 20th January confirming his first letter. He added, however, that the tower had only been erected for protection in the first instance and since^ the sliahuh had now resumed raiding, having killed a doiikey and knocked dc^fhi a house, and were also indulging in stealing by night, he could not postpone the completion of the tower any longer. Major R.G.S.Alban,0.E.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. •6 . It. appears from paras 287, 296 and 308 oi the Muscat. Intelligence Summaries for December 1940 that the Wall of Khasab was first appointed plenipotentiary, that the Sultan Luscat then chose another representative^ that the Muscat authorities were very much divided amongst themseves as regards uhe terms of the settlemen and that the Sultan himself had to seek outsiue advice - in fact ( a glorious muddle i not blame Khalid for his present action. Nor indeed can I agree with Hickinbotham that the erection of one snail tower by a very small community as a protection against actual maraudings by the 0 -\- subjects of a large neighbouring State can only keed fear and lead to more trouble. In fact, that seems to me merely reminiscent of Hitler and his dealings with small European States and when coupled with the fact that the Sultan openly wishes to deny Kalba any voice in the settlement of frontier disputes, gives rise to suspicion y regarding the intentions of the Muscat Government. Or is it that the hope by this means to conceal that they are incapable of controlling the outlying portions of their State ? peace, who puts the interests of his subjects before anything else. We cannot dpubt that his present intentions are sincere and if this dispute continues, I consider he should receive our full support© 7. In view of all these circumstances, therefore^I can- 8 .

Political Agency, Bahrain, the 12th February 1941. To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U SHIRE. Memorandum With reference to the recent troubles at Diba it is understood from the Political Cfficer Trucial Coast that the Sultan of Muscat wrote to Shaikh Khalid, Regent of Kalba, asking that the small tower erected by the people of Diba against the Shahuh$ should now be removed. The Political Officer Trucial Coast now reports that he has seen Shaikhs Khalid and Humaid and that they have signified their willing ness to leave the tower, which is incomplete, in its present state provided that the Sultan of Muscat gives suitable guaranties that he will control the Shahuhs to the extent th t he will pay comnensation for any damage or injury they may cause to the property or people of Diba. The Political Officer Trucial Coast considers this to be eminently reason able. Shaikh Khalid stated that he hoped that any such agreement might be made under British auspices, to the extend that we would use our good offices to ensure its enforcement. 2. The building of fortified towers is a very provocative step and is, I think, to be discouraged whenever possible, but in this case Shaikh Khalid has stated that the Shahuhs, who number some 10,000, had been very troublesome and had committed agression without notice and were still committing thefts in his territory. If, therefore, it is possible to obtain the Sultan of Muscat* s agreement to the guarantees asked /-(S&gt; - 2 - /O asked for without the condition of complete removal of the tower, the affair will be settled and if the Shahuhs should cause no further trouble during the next year the Shaikh of Kalba could be asked to remove the tower comnletely.

The Hon*hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir A I have the honour to refer to my telegram No. 834, dated the 18th April, 1941, and to inform you that I visited Dibah on the 17th of April accompanied by the Wali of Sohar who had been instruct ed by the Muscat Government to proceed there and to furnish a report on the situation. At Dibah I met the Sheikh of Fujairah and Ali bin Mudhaffar, Wali of Shinas, who had already been sent by the Muscat Government with instructions to endeavour to terminate the present hostilities which instructions, I am glad to report, he had been able to carry out before I arrived with the aid of the Sheikh of Fujairah. I visited the Jawasim section of the area and conversed with Barut, the Wali, afterwards inspecting the unfinished tower which has been the cause of much of the trouble. Later I went on to the Shihuh area and talked with the Shihuh Sheikh, Hassan bin Rahmah,and various tribal leaders from the hills of the Masandam Peninsula. As I was returning from Dibah to Khor Fakkan I met Khan Sahib Abdur Razzak, Residency Agent at Sharjah, and had a full discussion with him. Late the same evening after we had returned to Kalba we had a lengthy interview with Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmad, Regent of Kalba, and his nephew Sheikh Humaid bin Abdullah. 2. There have been changes in the political situation in the area affected by the recent incidents since the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf was produced by Lorimer in 1908. Mad-hah JjLorimer M Volume II /2 Volume II page 1696) is much the same and is visible from Khor Fakkan but appears to be only about four miles away. Ghunah ( ,, LorimeLr M Volume II page 1696) has altered little as far as I know and the same applies to A1 Hair ('Lorimar' Volume II page 1696), but in Dibah there have been important changes. The original village of Dibah now belongs exclusively to the Sharqiyin and it is the vill age of Bai'ah with which this despatch deals. The Jawasim have been ousted from Dibah and now inhabit the southern section of Bai*ah from the dividing Wadi mentioned by M Lorimer M at page 463 of Volume II for a distance of some six hundred yards to the north. Using the term Dibah to indicate the whole area as is generally done nowadays it will be noted that the Sharqiyin own the lower half while the Jawasim and the Shihuh are uneasy neighbours in the upper half of which the Shihuh have the larger share. The area is no longer in the Ras-al-Khaimah district of Sharjah. 3. The immediate cause of the trouble between the Jawasim and the Shihuh is the Regent of Kalba*s endeavour to manage his own affairs in Dibah and to protect his subjects from acts of brigand age. The Shihuh are of a peculiar and aggressive disposition and until recently did practically anything that they wished in the Jawasim area even, I understand, to the extent of liberating persons from the Fort and nothing was done to check their highhand- d behaviour by the Jawasim Wali nor I regret to say by the Wali of Khassab in whose Wilayat the majority of them live. As soon as the Regent of Kalba took action to end this state of affairs there were immediate and explosive reactions from the Shihuh. The position between the two tribes is not eased by the fact that their common frontier is, like so many frontiers in Arabia, ill defined. Between what is without doubt Jawasim territory and what is equally certainly Shihuh there is an area covered with date gardens some six hundred yards in length parallel to the beach, which is inhab ited by a small tribe known as the Dhuriyin who live with the Shihuh but pay half their Zakat to the Jawasira and half to the Shihuh /3 MB 1 ‘Kify- Shihuh. Neither side can lodge any certain claim to the area so it remains a 'no man's land'. The first encounter occurred in November and came to an end when the Sheikh of Fujairah and the Walls of Khassab and Sohar inter vened and succeeded in terminating the actual hostilities. The Jawa- sim then commenced to build a tower on the beach some hundred yards on the Shihuh side of the Jawasim fort and at the edge of what they can undoubtedly claim as their own territory, whereupon the Shihuh object ed and petitioned the Muscat Government to press for its removal or -permit them to construct an opposition tower. The Sultan refused to Permit them to build and negotiations were entered upon with the obj ect of persuading the Jawasim to remove their tower in return for a guarantee by the Sultan that he would control his subjects and accept responsibility for their acts and pending a decision the Regent of Kalba agreed to discontinue work on the building but he placed a small garrison in it. On the 28th March the Shihuh attacked the garrison and shots were exchanged but the action was inconclusive. |The Jawasim exasperated by the action of their neighbours seem to have (decided to accept an invitation to resume control of the villages of ad-hah, Ghunah, and A1 Hail',whose inhabitants akin to the Beni Saad sub-section of the Shihuh living between Shinas and Sohar have been paying -akat to the Shihuh for a number of years although I understand j. oi iginalxy paid -akat to the Jawasim and were indeed according ~ 0 Lorimer (Volume II page 1694) in 1908 part of the then disinteg- ( rating Jawasim Sheikhdom of Sharjah. I am told that the invitation to the Jawasim was made owing to the inhabitants' mistrust of the Shihuh and the uncertainty of the situation. The Jawasim were not M | opposed in their undertaking although shots continued to be exchanged j between the two tribes in Dibah. ' 1 4 * 0n the 3hihuh sid e the question of the tower looms very large indeed and was the immediate cause of the outbreak last month although their resentment at the Regent of Kalba's wish to be master in his own house is the real reason for the whole disturbance. The Shihuh knew that /4 i 1 - knew that the work of construction of the tower had ceased pending the result of the negotiations in progress and they considered that the Jawasim were not carrying out the spirit of the arrangement by placing a garrison on the foundations of the tower, and reports that the construction was actually being continued were believed by them The occupation of territory which the y con sidered rightly belonged to them, I refer to the Jawasim action at the villages of Mad-hah, Ghunah, and A1 Hair, further irritated them and the Shihuh from the hills were summoned to protect the ancestral lands and messages witl the corner dramatically burnt off as a sign that the contents affec &gt; ed matters of life and death were sent to Muscat calling on their ’ overlord for help. The total casualties during the recent hostilities are one killed on each side and one man wounded but I am in doubt if this last was a Jawasim or a Shihuh* 5. The Jawasim have every right to object to the attitude and actions of the Shihuh and the Muscat Government are certainly at fault in not taking adequate steps to control their subjects but the Jawasim are also at fault for, as the Regent acknowledged to me, they made no complaint to the Muscat Government prior to the hostilities in November and so did not give the Sultan an opportunity to regularise the position. This failure to communicate with iiluscat was due to the fact that for many many years the Jawasim have dealt direct with the Shihuh over tribal matters and do not seem to have considered Shihuh territory as Muscat territory. The tower is strategically useless, politically highly undesirable, and has already caused trouble enough, and although I do not believe the Shihuh statement that the work of construction was continued after it had been agreed that it should cease, I consider that the estab lishment by the Jawasim of a guard on the building was not in accordance with the spirit of the agreement between the Regent and the Sultan. The occupation of the villages of Mad-hah, Ghunah and A1 Hair was /5 b I Hair was, to say the least of it, carried out at a very ill chosen’ time by invitation though it may have been. There is no doubt if the Muscat Authorities had exercised proper control in the Shihuh area the present situation would not hav arisen so that there is really very little to clfese between the two parties and I suggest that the past be not disturbed any further than it has been already and our attention be concentrated on the future. A truce has been negotiated to last two months during whi. time it is hoped that the questions of the tower and the villages o: t-hah, Ghunah, and A1 Hair will be satisfactorUy settled and provided the Sultan returns in time I see no reason why this should not be done and even if it takes longer than two months to complete j the negotiations there could be no objection to the truce being extended, 6 * 1 su &amp;g est ‘that the Sultan should undertake to control his subjects in Dibah and that in return the Regent of Kalba should re move the tower. As regards the villages of Mad-hah, Ghunah,and ' kl Hair the actual sovereignty should be determined between the two parties or if they prefer or fail to agree between themselves it should be referred to arbitration. If the decision goes against th« Sultan then there is no more to be said and if the decision goes against the Regent then he can always say that he went there by ltation under a misapprehension and withdraw gracefully. These suggestions are on the whole acceptable to the Regent but he did not actually agree to the immediate demolition of the tower on the Sultan's guaranteeing the good conduct of his subjects but preferred to retain the unfinished structure for one year to act as a reminder presumably of the Sultan's undertaking nor did I mention the question of the method of determining the ownership of the area in dispute if they should be unable to agree on this ques tion. However I should prefer to see the tower removed and feel that Sheikh Khalid would not really raise any strong objection. I suggest I approach the Sultan on the above lines and at the same time I /i time I propose to press him to put his own representative into Dibah, a course of action which would do much to reassure the Jawasim and would be beneficial to the Shihuh though it would possibly not be altogether appreciated by their Sheikh, Hassan bin Rahmah, who I trust will be replaced by a more reliable person, / t I have discussed the question fully with Khan Sahib Abdur Razzak who is I understand in agreement with my views on the situation. I have also had an opportunity since writing the major portion of this despatch of discussing the matter informally with Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal, the Sultan’s uncle and Representative. He I considered the Shihuh to blame and spoke of the Jawasim as being oppressed by them and viewed with much favour the appointment of a representative of the Muscat Government at Dibah (Shihuh). He seemed little interested in the three villages and I can only trust that his nephew*s views will be as acceptable and conducive to the speedy settlement of the whole question. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd./ T&lt;, Hickinbotham.

According to your Express Letter No. C/223 dated the 27th June 1941 to the Political Agent, Muscat, copy to me, the Sultan had to appoint a representative at Dibah (Dhihuh) and the ^awasim tower could be left standing, provided it was not again occupied. 3. It now appears that the Sultan’s representative is to be one Hamdan bin Mohammad, a Shihi, who is to be both Shaikh and Wall (Sultan’s representative) at Bai’ah (Dibah - Shihuh). The whole idea of the Sultan appointing a representative atB'ai'ah was to have an impartial official on the spot who would prevent a recurrence of the incessant fighting between the ^awasim and Shih’** s. 5.

I suggest that the Political Agent, Muscat, might take up this matter again and request that a representative other than a Shihi be appointed. 4. As regards the tower, it appears that Said Ahmad bin Ibrahim, representative of the Muscat State, h-'S demanded that it be demolished. If the tower had been left un occupied then he hpd no grounds for making such a request. I do not myself, however, believe thc;t the tower has been left unoccupied and a certain amount of justification for its occupation exists owing to the unsatisfactory way in which the Muscat State are treating the Shihuh question. I suggest therefore that the State be asked to drop the question of demolition of the murabba and that Shaikh Khalid be instructed to see that the tower remains unoccupied. 5. The Political Agent, Muscat, might also enquire regarding the allegation that parties of armed men are being sent by the Muscat State from the Patineh to Eai’ah, presumably with the intention of assaulting the Qawasim. If there is any truth in the report, as there possibly is, the State, might be required to stop doing this and withdraw the men already sent. 6. Ag regards the ‘ adi Madha, please see my Express Letter 2$o.

He is officially the Regent of Kalba but he spends practically all his time in the vicinity of Sharjah instead cf attending to his business at Kslba. Shaikh Khalid used to be the Shaikh of Sharjah until he was turned out by the present Shaikh and the only interpretation which can be placed on his constant residence in the vicinity of Sharjah is that he is up to some intrigue against the present Shaikh; in this connection vide correspondence ending with my mefliorandum No. C/1145 dated the 8th December 1941. The whole district of Sha/nalyiah comprising Kalba, ^jairah Khor Fakkan, etc., on the east coast of Musandum is practically entirely cut off from the west coast, as 1 found on my recent visit there, and there is no valid reason why Shaikh Khalid should constantly absent himself.

The Political Officer Trucial Coast and the Residency Agent visited Kalba on the 7th March and interviewed Shaikh Khalid (Regent of Kalba), Shaikh Abdullah (the Regent f s brother) and Shaikh Humaid (the Regent*s nephew). Pelly informed Shaikh Khalid that the Political Resident had received a report that he, Shaikh Khalid, was being aggressive in the Wadi Madha and had directed that he should be warned to abide by the agreement recently arrived at. Shaikh Khalid replied that (1) in December 1941 he agreed with the Muscat party to demolish to a certain level the tower which has featured in the case (2) that he had fulfilled wholly his side of the agreement and the Muscat party admitted that he had done so (3) that the Muscat party had agreed to pay him Rs 600/- in compensation for his demolition of the tower but, so far, they had failed to make this payment, and (4) that since the agreement he had not aggressed in any way in the Wadi Madha nor \ / had— •p —— - 2 - had there been in his relations with the Muscat party, anything which even savoured of hostility. 3# Shaikh Khalid produced documents which corroborated his statement and the Political Officer Trucial Coast therefore refrained from administering any further warning.

On the 17th Jamad el Thani I received the following complaint from Shaikh Hamdan bin Ahmed Al-Shuhi and his tribesmen against their neighbours the Jawasim s 1) Rebuilding of the tower which they formerly agreed to its dismantling and that it should not be built higher than it was after dismantling. 2) Construction of various buildings in contrary to the stipulations which prevent the construction of building of mud and stones. 3) The Jawasim show reluctance in recovering debts due from the Jawasim to Shihus. 4) The Jawasim arrest, with the knowledge of the Shihus any person of them known to have committed a crime. I, after hearing these arguments from them decided to send two representatives to make enquiries in the matter and to keep Hamdan in Muscat till their return. Accordingly Shuwain bin Amir Alhoueani and Rashid bin Salim Almamari who were in the company of the Minister for Internal Affairs when the agreement between these two tribes was made proceeded there. I enclose for your information a copy of their report. Ahmed bin Hasan one of the Jawasin^s leading men was present when the two representatives sent by me saw that the wall of the tower was made higher, the construction of the new surround ing walls and the building of two new stores. He said to Shaikh Humaid that all these constructions were new. As regards items 3 and 4. These are to be decided according to law. The building of the tower and the other new constructions are however considered to be an offence from the Jawasim and a breach of the terms to which both the tribes had agreed. Each tribe possesses a copy of this agreement. # It is therefore requested that you will please write to the Consul on the subject, so that the Jawasim should keep on their boundaries and remove the stores and new buildings they have made. Both tribes should adopt a way that would ensure safety and peace between them and should try their utmost to avoid such moves which might 3e&amp;d to a great trouble in the long run.Copy of the report submitted by representatives Shuwain bin Amir Alhousani and Rashid bin Salim Almamari on the offence carried out by the Jawasim against the Shihus in Diba. These two representatives have reported 1. Rebuilding of the tower and the construction of a surrounding wall. 2. Construction of two new stores. 3. Debts. Humaid states that there is a certain time for collecting debts and that he will be responsible for all that is due from his men, provided his men receive their debts also. A rrest of conv i cts.

The Shihu are a restless people and the Jawassira/very rightly, suffer from an inl'eriority complex. There will never be peace between the middle third and the upper third oi the village of Diba until the Sultan of Muscat appoints a Wall to control the Shihu lands and that part oi i)iba whivii lies within his frontiers. Khassab is far too remote from Diba for it to be practica ble for tho Wall of Khassab to direct the affairs of Diba,though it might be possible for the fall of Khassab to reside at Diba leaving a Naib at Khacsab to look after the wants of thv Royal Navy. This solution would possibly pro%e acceptable to the Sultan of Muscat as it would be tho most economical arrangement, and I believe that the Sultan’s principal objection to the creation of a new waliat is that the salary will have to be found for the Wall, and the Shihu would be unlikely to offer to contribute. 3. Arbitration has been tried in the past without success, the settlement of these disputes by mutual agreements has also been tried and the agreements have never been kept; a firm and heavy hand is what is required to keep these people in order-. / I r*■*&lt; — _ mmmmm 2 .

Diba Affairs No.C/^l Political Agency, Bahrain, 19th February 1945MRHHHHHi m Copy of letter dated the 5th October, 1944 from His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and Oman to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Muscat. I have received your demi-official letter No. 1361.0838 dated the 3rd August, 1944 and noted what mentioned hy you about the trouble which took place between the Shihuh and the Qawasim in Dibah. 2. I approve the proposal regarding the appointment of an official for the Shihuh at Dibah, but I cannot decide this matter now. In my opinion it requires some con sideration in order to ensure good result and continuance of the establishment per manently in future. 3. In this connection I have already mentioned to the Honourable the Political Eesident while in Muscat what the Qawasim do against the Shihuh in Dibah. And as I understand all the troubles which happen in Dibah are due to the Qawasim.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00000b_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/620</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00000b</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/620</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 22/12 Situation at Diba'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1940/1945</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-05-23T00:04:15</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (90 folios)</extent><extent>File papers are arranged more or less chronologically.</extent><extent>Foliation: The main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover (f 1) and terminates at the back cover (f 90); these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.

The correspondence discusses the opposition of the Muscat authorities both to the building of this defensive post on the boundary between Qawasim and Shihuh territory and to the occupation of three Qawasim villages in nearby Wadi Madha land in the Shamaliyah District, by armed men sent by the Regent of Kalba, in response to an appeal by the villagers for protection against Shihuh attacks. Also reported are the several visits to Diba by official representatives from Muscat and Kalba, as well as local British officials, to secure a temporary truce and resolve the more or less permanent state of tribal conflict existing in the locality, by negotiating a lasting peace settlement.The main correspondents are the Residency Agent and the Political Officer for the Trucial Coast, (both based at Sharjah); the Political Agents for Bahrain and Muscat; and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. There are also English translations and one Arabic transcript of several letters from Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad [Āl Qasimī, Shaikh Khālid bin Ahmad] the Regent of Kalba to the Residency Agent, Sharjah, mainly in 1941, about repeated attacks on Diba by the Shihuh and the progress of his peace negotiations with the representative of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. There are English translations of several other letters from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman and his ministers, to the Regent of Kalba and the British Consul Muscat, about outbreaks of fighting between the Shihuh and Qawasim at Diba, including a list of Shihuh complaints against the Qawasim (folio 70) and the peace agreement made in 1941 (folio 74).The file also includes a small, black and white photograph (folio 78) of the fortified tower at Diba, taken in 1944 by the Political Officer for the Trucial Coast, Sharjah, after it had been rebuilt in contravention of the peace agreement between the Qawasim and Shihuh inhabitants.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent and Consul, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Regent of Kalba</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="family"><namePart>Shiḥūḥ (Tribe)</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Qawāsim (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Diba</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kalba</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Bilateral relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Ethnic conflicts</topic></subject><subject><topic>Fortifications</topic></subject><subject><topic>Peacemaking</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00000b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
