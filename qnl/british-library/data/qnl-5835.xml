The first contains an original missive from Imam Yahya of the Yaman, advising Ibn Sa’ud to make peace with the Sharif, in order to counteract the intrigues of people (mutilated group) who are actively engaged in sowing dissention amongst the Arabs. Ibn Sa’ud w commenting on the letter says it brings out all his previous state ments regarding King Husain^ anticipated policy and proves that he is untiring in his efforts to form a sort of strategical anti-Euro pean league. The contents of the second letter are as follows:- Ibn Sa'ud reports that during his absence at 'Uquair his force guarding the northern / frontier encountered the low-class rabble collected by Salim, and both sides suffered casualties. He considers it important to inform you of the occurrence and urges you most earnestly to settle the dispute with Kuwait, otherwise there may be a great conflagration. He again reminds you that he will only accept you as arbitrator and once more refuses the mediation of any Arab chief. He wants to know whether Salim is independent ant free from control or not. He is restraining his force out of a desire to please his friends, the British Government, He reminds you that Salim is well known and of no importance.

I myself warned Salim that his bairaq and forces at Jahrah were merely an incitement to the Ikhwan and that he had far better de mobilize and trust to our peaceful intervention, but he did not sms things in the same light, I am not prepared to encourage fresh hostilities by advising Salim to reocoupy Jahrah with a force.

I am unable for a moment to believe he was privy to it particularly after the assurances Just given to me, but it does show that the Ikhwan are out of hand, and it will inevitably create a very bad impression on His Majesty's Oovernawnt. It is urgently necessary that amicable relations should be established at ones between him and Salim. To this end I invite him to come to Basrah forthwith for the purpose of meeting him under our auspices, and meanwhile send peremptory orders to Dawish and his 4 f force at Subaihiyah to withdraw from Kuwait territory, lilnds.

From Political, Bahrain* To Highcom, Baghdad; repeated to Bushire, Kuwait &amp; Navy. No. 4C2-C. Dated 5th (Reed. 6 th) November 1920. I have received a dignified letter from Ibn Sa^d, dated the 26th October, relative to the affair at Jahrah, enclosing a long report from Faisal ad-DawIsh dated the 13th. These letters throw quite a new light on the attack on Jahrah and the causes which led up to it Summary of Ibn Sard’s letter begins I have already reported the facts of the encounter at Jahrah as I received them. I have now received fuller details from Faisal which I hasten to send you, with the request that you will telegraph the facts to the High Commissioner, as misleading reports emanating from Kuwait are in circulation. From the first I feared that the ^ concentration of Ibn TawSlah’s Shamraar at Jahrah under Shaikh Salim*s war flag meant trouble, and I reported my fears. I warned my frontier (mutilated group) against a surprise attack. Later I sent my cousin ’Abdul 'Aziz atSurki to keep them in hand. What did SSlim do? After Ibn Tawalah and Da'IJ returned from raiding the South (See my telegrams No. 304~C and No. 314-C), he sent out three parties to attack NaJd,'one of which actually reached Rumah, one and a half days from Riyadh, and captured a largfc number of camels. The Mutair under Faisal hotly pursued the raiders as far as Jahrah where a fight took place, for details of which see Faisal*s report. I hasten to inform you of these facts, as my object is to do nothing contrary to the wishes of His Majesty*s Government. Personally I attach little importance to the whole affair. Ends. For Faisal*s report see my Immediately following telegram.Telegram (P) Prom Political, Bahrain* To Highcom, Baghdad; repeated to Bushire, Kuwait &amp; Navy, No. 4C3-C. - — Dated 5th (Reed. 6 th) November 1920* My telegram No. 402-0* Summary of Dawieh's letter begins:- After Da* 1^*0 return from the southern raid I concentrated the Mutair in readiness. Then came the news that three of Salim*s raiding parties had left Jahrah;the first under Ibn Tawalah against Habah, the second under Ibn Majid against Rumah, and the third under Karan against Shibak. All three raids were successful and many camels were captured. Our forces started in hot pursuit and followed the raiders till they reached Jahrah* We failed to recover the camels. Our main pursuit reached Subaihiyah as the enemy got to Jahrah. We decided to recover their value by attack as they were out grazing. To have retreated would have brought disaster. We attacked and, although Salim’s forces had the advantage in numbers and position, God gave us the victory and we captured Jahrah* Salim took refuge in the Qasr al-Ahmar and begged for peace fromthere. I replied that I would refer to you, I moved to Subaihiyah to await your orders and now ask for an early reply* We ourselves only attacked to recover our property. If your answer is *‘peace M , then God be praised, but if you want Kuwait itself captured, only send us our comrades from 'Urtawiyak and we require no further assistance. Our losses were one hundred » killed and two hundred wounded. The Kuwait losses are not known but were heavy. The wounded are doing well and the killed have .attained heaven.

I have already written to you yesterday that our departure for Mecca was de layed, and thus we are to leave Riyadh tomorrow Saturday, 7th August 1920 (21st Dhil-Qaadah 1338). All the choicest requisitioned have, I am told, arrived today and all is ready for the journey which for want of time has evidently become slid more arduous in itself. “Tawakkalan ala Allah,” as the Arab says, we trust in God. The mere fact that we are going, a mission from Bin Sand to Sharif, gives one immense satisfaction. To tell you the truth there was little hope of it as you will see from my last report of yesterday’s date. It is also satisfactory to note that the Naib, Ahmad Thaniyan, is now distinctly better or more sober in his talk or opinions about the Sharif. He is, if I am not mistaken fairly promising and reasonable and will, it is hoped, make matters smooth. The schism or gulf between the two sides is terribly wide, perhaps too wide to be bridged. One can only hope for the best. As Bin Saud is not with us and it is only a Naib in the person of Ahmad Thaniyan I have adopted Farhan Bag’s proposition of our own separate mess, etc. The Imam is said to have ordered the general stores, supplies, etc., for the party but I am buying some provisions and sundries, also a few abbas. It will all heilp to give us a sort of independent character in the eyes of the Arabs and also be useful to draw men and get information. That interesting individual Ibn Shalhoob (who by the way is the son of a settler in Riyadh from Haleb, Syria) comes and tells us just now that the Imam will “ Send us armed.” This will be irony of fate ; instead of having the whole Nejd pilgrim party unarmed for the satisfaction of the Sharif, we our selves are to go armed. Of course any arms that Bin Saud might- give us will be for the journey and intended for show, as usual. I have seen old Imam, Abdur Rahman, who, somehow, succeededun shaking off his “ piety ” and condescended to receive us both with more than expected courtesy. He talked of old Indian Ulema, one (last and best known) of them being Maulvi Siddiq Hasan Khan, who rose from the modest position of an ordinary aalim to be Chief Secretary of the last Begum of B&amp;hopl, and latterly married the Begum, re ceiving as a necessary adjunct the title of Nawabr Pe haps the mere chance that I possess the same name as the late Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan of Bhopal, ensured a kind reception for me from this old Imam, who is, naturally a bigoted Wahhabi. Saud, the eldest son, favourite and heir-apparent of Abdul Aziz is a charming youth of 19 or 20 years. He is very affable and may be a near approach to his eminent father later on. He said, he would some day like to go to Wilayat (England) for a tour. Faisal is rather backward or too young to show any marked qualities. The rest are all poor desolate souls—hopeless bigots, and foolishly disgustingly ew^i-foreign. Bin Saud is writing to Qusaibi to be quick with the light-buoy in Ojair harbour. When I spoke to him he said he had ordered it long ago, and he was glad to learn that P. W. D. man was sent by you to survey. He will write to you on the subject. About our return Bin Saud has repeatedly expressed the desire that we should come back vid Riyadh ; but I cannot say nor have I promised him. It will depend on circumstances. As it is the journey to Mecca in this hot season and with so deadly a haste is as much as one can bear. Thank God, we are both keeping fairly fit. Hope you are enjoying good health. We both very much wish to see you in Bahrein on our return. With our respects and good wishes, Enclosure III to Serial No. (40). Memorandum No. 16, dated the 6th August 1920. From—Khan Sahib Saiyid Siddiq Hasan, Indian Assistant, Bahrein, (on deputation with the Nejd Mission, Riyadh), To—The Political Agent, Bahrein. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your memorandum No. 255-V.—0., dated the 23rd July 1920, which reached me in Riyadh on 1st instant, while the 15 books of 21forms for registration of country craft forwarded therewith, have been delivered to me only this morning, having arrived last night. I have explained the use of these forms to Bin Sand and have requested His Excellency kindly to send the books in due proportion to his ports of Qatif, Ojair and Jubail for use there. I am glad to report that Bin Sard has after SQme discus sion, agreed to order the registration of Najd, Hassa and Qatif dhows at an early date and is sending the books of forms to the Amirs in the above three ports with letters of instructions to enforce registration. I have at his request filled up one form to serve as sample. Enclosure IV to Serial No. (40). Memorandam No. dated the 20th Dhil-Qaadah 1338 (Gth Augu&amp;t 1920). Irom—Khan Sahib Saiyid Siddiq Hassan, Indian Assistant, Bahrein (on deputa tion with the Nejd Pilgrimage, Riyadh), To—The Political Agent, Bahrein. I beg to report the following items of news, etc., which have partly been gh aned in conversation with Bin Sand and others, and partly obtained by means of secret informers :— (1) Reference my memorandum* No. 12 of 1st instant (31st July ?), I received secret information that Abdullah bin Abdur Rahman, Bin Saud’s brother, received a letter on 1st August, informing him of the Ikhwan victory fc pver Bani Abdullah, 'and capture of Al-Hurra, west of Medina. The latter stated that the Ikhwan killed * 400 of the inhabitants and did not spare women and children. On reading this, Abdullah is said to have spoken to those present, expressing his disgust and horror saying that this was not in Islam, that such brutality w r as hot permitted in any religion, and that he feared the Ikhwan will sooner or later incur God’s wrath. When visiting Bin Baud the same afternoon, I waited to hear something of it, but when notliing was mentioned by him, I said I had heard firing of some 20 shots early in the morning and wondered what was the matter. Bin Saud said, t{ Oh, it was a trifling thing. A man has come with news of some Ikhwan ghazu and success over Bani Abdullah ; the man calls it “ busharah ” (happy news) and wants a “ dhalul ” (riding camel) as his own died on the way ; I shall give him one—a common thing.” It will be noticed that Bin Saud did not like to enlighten me on the subject for the obvious reason that this might be reported to His Majesty’s Government as one of his (or Ikhwans' activities against Hejaz). 2 3 (2) Reference previous reports, Bin Saud has now received letters from ’Asir saying that the Ikhwan, under Abdul Aziz bin Musaid as Saud, have gained complete victory. They have captured Hajlah and Ubbaha or (Ibbaha) the capital of 'Asir, after a siege of ten days. Two thousand of the garrison and inhabitants are reported to have been killed, but the ruler, Bin Marai, escaped to the hills. Ikhwan loss reported to be 15 men killed and 4 horses. The Akhwan are in occupa tion and Bin Musaid has appointed Amirs of towns and villages from among the inhabitants themselves, tie has offered to restore the town and everything else looted or captured provided that Bin Marai and his people become Moslims (Ikhwan). Imam Idrisi, advised by the late Turkish Wali, who is said to have managed some how or other to remain on, is co-operating with Bin Saud’s forces, and giving them moral and ijraterial help, the reason being that the Imam Idrisi is very friendly to Bin Sand, and an enemy of the Sharif who is said to have instigated the ruler of ’Asir to commit certain aggressive acts against both the Idrisi and Bin Saud. Above is nearly fully confirmed by Bin Saud in conversation. (3) The Ikhwan and their ulema (learned men or priests) are no less a source of anxiety and worry to Bin Saud than a satisfaction in having so many of them’as a ready weapon. On the evening of the 3rd instant I heard (from my quarters, which are separated by a wall from the evening majlis of the Imam) him deliverimg a long address in loud harsh tone : “ You have to obey God and His Prophet (peace of God be on his soul'’). He always repeats this pious phrase when speaking or4 * • , ,, it i . p rnT ,heW—“ And you have to obey me according to Kitab- TuTm 1 /'ol ic A -Koran) and “ Sunnat Basuleh ” (recorded customs Allah (Book of God, i.e., A1 ivo a ) morn i n „ w hen I was calling on him, and traditions o ‘ e . ^ ut „ 0 f an i, nam i n addition to his arduous task I complimen &lt; „ ■ l„ n( i oaij that he had no rest or peace , he would rather as a ruler T ^ P ' d 'oldivep^ in a small island if he could, and f ° r dd%v fromhirmfsent envhonments 3 which were so much taxing his would fly from Ms present ^ did not even en j the ordinary night s energies and weighing h m dm ^ 1 ' g ni Ws _ Th V Shaikh (meaning Ab- 'f 11 ‘t’! tdn AbdJ Latif the chief Alim, Qazi and Mufti of Riyadh) was annoyed dulkh bin A . , ’ , TUR wan Ulema, as they preached against every body Th - TaLressaon or use of force). They even strongly criticised him, Bm Sand, for his friendly relations with “ ajanib ” (foreigners). He had a most difficult task to perform to maintain friendly relations with rule s and powers Unlike his nredecessors he had to live in treaty relations with powers, like the But. , whom he liked fm their justice and fah-^ ten^of tS InTmat^t 6 mi the &amp;hllkt and to conciliate him. He had already been 4-1 fra fhp ^hnil^h on the previous evening when the Shaikh could not be pro Sated “buVttfv^ZrShe had effected a full compromise. The Ikhwan Ulema had solemnly promised to the Shaikh as their spiritual head Bin Saud, it may be noted here, most wisely ignores himself for a moments, acts as a go between and keeps in the back-ground, as, after all, he is only their ruler, and does ft Zml in the .elisions bigot’s mind for quite as much respect and devotion as does a spiritual head-Shaikh) that they will attend to and settle all cases sent to them by him, and will only refer back to him in case of real doubt or difficu } , that they will preach in mosques only on subjects or topics of a purely rehgious nature which null be previously noted down for them by the Shaikh himself that they will without fail, come to Riyadh and receive instructions from the Shaikh at short intervals ; that they will say nothing to what Bm Sand said or dia m p i tical e^erndl matters or about his relations outside Nejd . With immense influence that this Shaikh has over all m Nejd, the above is, I think, the best remed} anc safeguard Bin Sand could possibly apply or devise, against rampant Ikhwamsm which one is often lead to think is fast getting out of hand control of even so strong and perfect an Arab ruler as Abdul Aziz bin Saud himself. (41 There is a surprisingly large number of men coming to Bin Saud daily frnrn all sides These visitors' really mean a great deal of expense, as, according to the Arab custom, they are all guests, not excluding litigants, who come to fiaht their own cases or answer charges, and are not only fed, but given kiswah (robes) and other “ ikram ” (cash present, arms, etc.). One of these is an Abbas al Fallaj from Syria, arrived 10 days ago, is sauj to have brought letter (whether from Emir Faisal or other leading men, it cannot be as pertained Bin Saud,dioweve^, mentioned to me in the course of his conversations that in addition to the pressure laid by His Majesty’s Government, he knew that much pressure was brought to bear upon the Sharif from Syria, urging him to trv and make peace with him, Bin Saud). This man is said to have come here twice before He is camping out near the Imam’s garden, north of the town, and appears to be of some importance as he has 5 horses and several attendants with him. Some of these daily visitors come with cases and complaints of a serious nature, or inter-tribal disputes, other for mere “ wajah ” (seeing) Imam, which means a begging visit, to get money or help. But a large proportion are evidently news letters carriers, who come 'from far and near. Fine, though evidently expensive, intelligence system is thus created and maintained by the Imam. As soon as a man ‘‘nawwakh ” (dismounts from his camel), he is reported by means of a little slip which is written and sent up by a clerk, always present at the gate (of which I am enclosing,two samples herein) and is Slips detained in tins office. immediately called up and seen by Bin Saud himself, though for a couple of minutes. His verbal news, or message or letter, as the case may be, is received, and he is sent off to the ‘‘ mudhif ”, guest-house. Ordinary visitors are sent away after a day or two of their arrival with “ ikram ”, while others remain according to their business or object of visit, are granted private 235 interviews or received in audience in a big well furnished hall and eventually sent back with suitable presents of cash, cloths, arms, etc. All this goes on daily in a perfectly regular methodical way which itself is creditable and characteristic of this wide-awake ruler. (5) Yesterday Bin Saud mentioned two things, both of which seem to be fresh light he has received. Why, he said, he wondered, Thamir-al-Mansur and Yusuf-al-Mansur, were arrested and imprisoned by Government. The latter was possibly an intriguer and agitated against the English as result of awta’-British and an^-Foreign propaganda from Syria, but the former is up to nothing, he is harmless, b arhan Beg replied that he did not know anything of it, but that these two might be of the icolish lot who were uselessly trying to get independent government not knowing that they were not fit for it in any sense. The second thing was : Bin Saud said, he had learned that Government had started to send cases for decision or arbitration to Saiyid Talib, who was also employed occasionally in settling diffi cult tribal disputes, etc. If this was true the Government were making a mistake as this would give Talib his longed for opportunity of gaining influence, which was wholly undesirable, for Talib if ever he gets any hold on people, must indulge in his old pastime of intrigue, and against whom will that intrigue be directed ?— against the British Government itself. This he said, Government would find to be a true prophesy sooner or later. I am afraid that I am becoming rather prosiac in reporting these remarks and the like ; but I prefer to try and let you know all I hear, rather as much of the interesting talks of this interesting gentleman, as I can remember, and be reminded of by my companion, Farhan Beg, who is very helpful to me. Enclosure V to Serial No. (40). Memorandum No. 18-C., dated 5th-6th August 1920. From— Khan Silrb Saiyid Siddiq Hassan, Indian Assistant, Bahrein (on deputa tion with the Nejd Pilgrimage, Camp Pdyadh), To—The Political Agent, Bahr in. I beg to report that since the receipt of your letter of 27th July 1920 embodv- ing Government’s, approval of Bin Baud’s proposal to send a mission to Mecca although Bin Saud had expressed his satisfaction and pleasure on the Civil Com missioner’s answer yet a tendency was noticed on his part to minimize the advantage of the proposed mission and for the greater part of severely criticizing and blaming (if I may say abusing) King Husain. The curious part of it was that Bin Saud did so in hi; private conversation with Farhan Beg and myself and at the same time repeatedly said that he had been telling his people quite different that is good things about the Sharif so that their feeling might be softened and the Haj and a rapprochement made easier, etc. He would not for two days (during 4 interviews) after receipt of the above reply of Civil Commissioner appoint or declare whom he was going to depute, nor the number of men he would send to Mecca. Under these circumstances I asked for a special interview in the evening and accompanied by Farhan Beg saw Bin Saud alone on 3rd instant. After ordi nary exchange of inquiries after health and comfort and usual civilities, I said that I had been waiting to hear his orders and decision about the mission which he had himself proposed as the last resort and w r hich on receipt of your letter on 1st instant, he had promised to despatch with us on Thursday the 5th instant and that I should like to write and inform you of the definite decision, etc., in good time. Bin Saud replied that he had the matter in view r but that as he had been telling us he did not see much use, etc. I I then asked for his kindness and courte y to let me speak about the matter and he said “ Samm ” that is “ Bismillah ” do so. I then slowly and cautiously re viewed the whole history in brief of the differences and disputes between him and the Sharif as I had seen the correspondence going on on this, Bin Saud-King Husain, subject for the last 2 years especially reminding him of his own letters and communi cations submitted to Government through Bahrein pointing out that he himself 246 had been incessantly and bitterly complaining against various alleged aggressive acts of the King of Hejaz who in turn had been equally frequently complaining of sfnhlar hostile acts of his, Bin Sand’s ; both had sought a remedy and he himself hadsubmitted definite proposals ; his proposals had from time to time been ful y considered bv His Majesty's Government and at least three different courses seriously adonted or decided upon and then altered and modified only to meet his own wishes and P conveniense. (I was, of course referring to (1) the meeting at Aden, (2) Bin Sand going at the head of his people by land and meeting King Husain personal y at or near Mecca (3) Bin Sand sending a representative with a friendly mission to Mecca! I also pointed out that you (Major D.ckson) and the Civil Commissioner Colonel Sir Arnold Wilson, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., C.M.G. D.S.O-. etc had taken so much trouble in explaining matters to His Britannic Ma esty s Government, making favourable recommendations and generally furthering his interests in every w-ay, . • n ii,;/lance tlicir own. and that it would be a great pity indeed if this Farhan Beg-al-Rahmah, whom I had instructed belorcnand, tooK a very active ana useful part inasmuch as he in his own rough and ready Arab way, practically convey- e^the opportune threat (in an affectionate manner using the words va n ah uz va tawil al umr ”, which so much appeal to an Arab mind) that if he dilly-dallied k this last moment and the chance of Ha) for Nejd.s and of attempting a friend y ccttlrment or negotiations with the Sharif was lost then he, Bin Baud, will not only lose the sympathies of his powerful friends Colonel Wilson and Major Dickson but would seriously offend His Majesty’s Government, who had already exercised too much patience with him, and pressed the Sharif to acquiesce, etc. To this I signi fied mv agreement in suitable words saying this was the time for him to prove to fiovernment the bom tides of his intentions towards King Husain and requests to Government. In short the result was very favourable and Bin Saud declared that he had, as already promised to me on receipt of your letter on 1st irstant, definitely decided to send a friendly mission headed by one of the Faud (ruling) family. After a little more talking, he declared he would send Ahmad Thaniyan with a very small number of men and will, for the sake of Government, write extremely conciliatory letters and send presents to King Husain and Sharif Abdullah and that he could only hope that good will come of all this and he more than any one else, loved peace and tranquillity, etc. He has ordered Ahmad Thaniyan to be ready to start at once and make all necessay preparations. On the whole, I think, this is a good selection as this gentle man is fairly well read and amenable to reason. He has been to see me twice and we have talked of our business. I think he will do well. The number going from Riyadh is now practically fixed up and comes to about 150 men, all Haddar, the delegate being only Ahmad' Thaniyan, the others are only Hajis. We may be expected to be joined by about so many, possibly more, as we proceed. Neither Bin Saud nor Ahmad Thaniyan, can tell how many will Haj, but I gather the im pression that the aggregate will not exceed a few hundreds, it may only be 300 to 400 men as there is very short time left and only the happy owner of a first rate riding camel can reach in time fo ’ the Haj. It is the selection of best dromedaries that has delayed us. We are now timed to start on Saturday morning 7th August 1920 —21st Dhil-Qaadah 1338, expecting to arrive in Mecca on 21st August= 4th Dhil Haj j. The journey has, thus to be performed in great haste in the shortest possible time. I trust you will kindly inform the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad to have neces- sarv warning sent telegraphically bo His Britannic Majesty’s Agent at Jeddah, Indian Political Officer, Jeddah, and His Majesty King Husa in inorder to have the mission met at Asherah, as Bin Saud has desired.

From— Khan Sahib Saiyid Siddiq Hasan, Indian Assistant, Bahrdn (on deputa tion with Nejd Pilgrimage, Camp Daraiyah), To—M ajor H. R. P. Dickson, CJ.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. Just two lines to let you know that we have after all started off for Mecca, thank God. We with a party of ten, that is five slaves and three attendants, Farhan and myself, left Riyadh at 5 a.m. this morning and arrived here at about 9 a.m, 257 * Ahmad Thaniyan and his party of Hajis were to join us here and their kit has just arrived (3 p.m.). They join us at the “ asha ” dinner 7 p.m., and We start on with our whole-night marches of which first comes off to-night. Thanks to Farhan Be»’s open mouthed talk, I have been given a good kajawah to sit or lie in and hope to be tolerably comfortable, if comfort can be had in travelling across Arabia m summer. Last night when we took leave of the Imam, he spoke very kindly and urged us both to “ stick to Ahmad Thaniyan ” and return via Riyadh. He said he would write to you and promised to pass letters up and down, if any were sent by or to you. I will try and keep you posted from the route. I am still in the dark about the number of our party. Kindly bear us bobh in mind. Farhan has rather frightened me by a casual remark but I do hope and wish that I shall find you in Bahrein on our return. Of course your own kindness of heart is a security that you will not forget your humble subordinate and sincere friend and admirer. The slaves of Bin Saud are just leaving for Riyadh so I close in hurry. With best respects and all good wishes for your health and prosperous life. Enclosure YII to Serial No. (40). Translation of a letter dated 22nd Dhil-Qaadah 1338 (8th August 1920) from Bin Saud to King Husain of Hejaz. After compliments and due respects to your Highness. The object in writing this cordial letter and submitting the same to your Highness is to enquire after your Honour’s health. My condition will please you in every respect and nothing important has occurred which may be worthy of mention to your Highness. I have agreed that our friends the High British Government should be the means of mediation between us and I have requested them to bring about and establish friendly relations between my Government and that of your Highness , although in fact there does not seem to be any reason whatsoever why any dispute should exist between us, as I look upon your Highness as an affectionate father. I therefore have decided to send my cousin Ahmad al-Thamyan as-Saud as a special representative to present himself before your Highness with those who are in his company from the side of His Majesty’s Government namely Khan Sahib Saiyid Siddiq Hasan and Farhan Beg Al-Rahama two of their good men. Your Highness will kindly acquaint the aforesaid with what is in your mind, our obiect being to remove all differences and arrive at a settlement of all out standing questions, and also to establish friendly relations, and strengthen the bonds of friendship and to carry into practice good relations between our two countries. I pray to Almighty God, to grant us our desire for the common good of both sides. With my best respects to your honourable sons. My respected father and my sons Saud and Faisal and their brothers offer their best wishes and respects. This is what had to be said to your Highness and may you be preserved.

I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your esteemed letter dated 10th Dhil-Qaadah 1338 (27th July 1920) contents of which I have fully noted espe cially regarding the question of the French and the Sharif and the nationalists. God. be praised for this, but my only regret is that my friends the High British Government have not occupied Syria. As regards the Sharif Faisal I felt certain that he would commit such an action, for two reasons the first being that he is drunk with success and the second that he is ignorant and dishonest. Undoubtedly what has happened is due to the good luck of the Allies, and God has ruined his affairs before he could succeed in his plans or arrange that any of our enemies join him, namely any of the hostile powers. I hope, the Allied Powers will henceforward pay full attention towards the Arab affairs which may afford ease to all. I hope your honour will in-sha-Allah communicate to me all necessary news. Regarding your party : Khan Sahib Saiyid Siddiq Hasan and Shaikh Farhan and my cousin, Ahmad Al-Thaniyan, left as I informed your honour, and I told them of all news that I received while they were here, and surely they must have informed you in detail.

I beg to report below tbe gist of Bin Sand’s long conversation with me last evening in his private majlis. Farhan Beg was also present. ^nd started bv saying that the world was still very much disturbed .. m ®harbak’’ and that the Britfsh Government had a very difficult task to perform musnaroaK + ra nnmllitv etc There were troubles everywhere, India, Fvvnt Iraq Syria and even England itself. The Government were not following frons M cor/ect policy such as is most essential for the peace and order especially a strong or c ^ rre P • Th Government were too lenient and considerate of Arabia and Arab countries. lUe trove^ ^ ^ ^ ^ really gooTrespectable and useful men were ignored and cast away while upstarts and mean whW impostors “ aradhil wa mutaffialliqin ” were advanced, favoured W pampered. This was what the Turk did and ruined himself for ever. He often ponhred over things and events and did not see that Government knew exactly who was their friend and who was an enemy. He went on to to say that, as he explained to you at length, it was not good policy on Government’s part to seek to conciliate .tabs by heaping favours and4 gifts upon them especially when Government saw that they only 'got in return contumacy, intrigue and rebellion. Arabs could not be well governed except by force mixed with justice. . Constitutional Government such as was being thought ol for Iraq will only bring more trouble and unrest and entail serious consequences winch were not dreamed of at present. 1 I here tried to put in a few words about the British having accepted a moral responsibility, as a Mandatory Power, of administering the country with the heio and co-operation of the natives and gradually training them to look after their own affairs and that this was the matured judgment of the League of Nations and Peace Conference, etc., etc. Bin Sand, however went on with his usual flow of eloquence. “ Look at the Uiarit he said and his sons Faisal and Abdullah, what are they doing now ? I know tor certain that they are extremely pampered (as they are) by the British Uovernment. 1 hey are actually intriguing against and vilifying the English in Ifejaz, in Syria and Palestine and in Iraq ”. No one, he said, cared for or Luted either the Sharif or any of his sons ; still Government made so much of them and would go on supporting them He had himself received letters and secret pamph lets from Faisal tempting and cajoling him to join them ; but he could not possibly Britki C He could not afford P be . “^faithful to his pledges or be disloyal to the British Government as long as they did not break their treaty with him ' He has been always true to his word and will always be so, because his religion enforces qlLLkum” y rBe faltMultofh eqU ff ‘ r0m ^ “Fastaqimu lahummasta- are faithM to yiu] faItMul to them &lt; who are “ with you) as long as they ., He himself on the contrary , was not cared for by Government i • T sidy was stopped for two months which act of Government &lt;mve him a™ chagrin.

Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahr in. without TLal replvto'hTs 'last fottor't 1? Bin SaU&lt;J '' 0uld not bud § e p &gt; to nis last letter to you which is expected every hour. He 137 talks a lot as you will see from two long reports I am sending you today (my Nos. 9 and 10). He is not at all in good spirits though very kind to us. Yesterday I had a little brush up with our friend Ahmad Thaniyan whom you know very well. In talking of Bin Saud’s affairs and Government s inattention (so called) he said “ Major Dickson only forwards letters, he has no power, etc. Both F; ,rhan Beg and myself naturally felt annoyed as it was not only imperti nence but wrong and mischievous remark. On our talking rather sharply and telling him how much you had done for Bin Baud whose interests you had made as your own, the gentleman changed at once and started to speak ma dilterent strain—appreciation, gratitude and the like. To my amazement Bin Baud himself said in the course of conversation in the evening (probably an echo of Ahmad Thaniyan’s talk of the noon) that his agents m Bahrein, “ Wukalai fil Bahrain ” had written to say that Major Dickson did not take as much interest in his (Bin Saud’s) affairs as formerly. We both argued the point and Bin Baud was evidently satisfied with our explanations harlian is positive that it is worthy Yusuf Kanoo doing petty mischief. He it is and not Qusaibi (as I thought) who must have written some trash to the Imam, who you know is so fond of getting news from any place or person. The truth of the matter is that poor Bin Baud is extremely bored and worried now-a-days as you will see from my reports and his own letter to you which he sent me to glance at just now. His indebtedness, increasing expenditure, the actions of Sharifs, Bin Rashid and Bin Sabah have all joined together to make Abdul-Aziz unhappy as he appears to me. He is even a bit nervous. In talking o the Kuwdt deputation yesterday morning he blushed red all of a sudden and ■ spoke in greatly irritated, almost undignified, tone “ Take your camels away there they are, as many as I could collect I cannot keep them as Shariah makes it haram for me to do so. Let Salim expect no good of me, no friendship or relations all is over. As to Bin Rashid, before the month is out I shall be on his head in Hail. Still Bin Baud is very kind and courteous to us. He sends for us daihj about twice a day and also came and saw us in our room today. ; He took me round to his Madhif (guest house), his big toshakhana and the guests dining hail. All these noint out to a very large expenditure. I saw some dozen big Aegs each said to hold five mbihah sheep with rice, some scores of Badus dmmg and an equal number receiving the kiswah and busy putting the robes on as soon as handed to them by Ibn Shalhub and his lieutenants. The Imam looked at all this with much self satisfaction saving “ Hadha shughl Badu wa atao hum etc. He would repeatedly say'that this entertainment and presents of cloth and money went on daily and emptied his coffers. It is very interesting to note that in talking about general health and doctor for Riyadh Bin Baud said he was very anxious to have a doctor as soon as may be be it an Indian or an Englishman, he only wanted a good man professionally and morally I said an English doctor would be better, especially as a surgeon. I did not say but I know from experience that an Indian Muslim doctor (unless he is Wahabi and regular in prayers, fasting, etc briefly aclwely rehgrous) wdl be more hated than an Englishman, who will only have to avoid drinking to be tolerably liked here. Except for the heat Riyadh is a vey good place, only too much of tie religious mania, a stranger must expect to hear or overhear curses even m reply to salaam. My habit of prayer-saying has stood in good stead and I have perfoce made a ‘‘ Musalman ” ofFarhan Beg who was less regular before. The heat and flies by day make it very unpleasant. Nights are ideal, nice and cool and calm. Water is good and becomes icy cool in the skins covered with gunny bags-a great relief indeed There are very good gardens, we have been inside of two of both the Imams. Grapes, datesf figs, water melon, khokhs are all very good and we at least, get plenty of them. The town is less dirty than Manamah but just under the soor there a.e heaps of filth and rubbish. All is well except that we are rather sorry over the prospect of Haj—perhaps we my not get a chance at all which will be very bad indeed from all points of view. I hope all is well in Bahrein and that you are enjoying the best of health, by grace8 swrrc °f God. Your orders are every moment awaited. I send this with two other covers and Bm Sand’s letter at 4 p. m. to-day, Saturday, 31st July 1920. Farhan Beg is doing splendidly and sends you his regards. With best wishes. , . s , X , a ™ cl °sing news is received from ’Asir that Bin Sand’s cousin Abdul Aziz bin Mus aid has captured Ubbaha or Ibbaha the chief town of ’Assir, and that Bin Marai has, after a severe defeat, fled to the hills. The report savs that the number ot garrison, etc., killed is greater than that at Taiabah last year and the town is now in Akhwans hands. The ruler is a friend of the Sharif who will no doubt complain to Jeddah and Cairo although he is alleged to have started the quarr. by instigating Bin Marai, the ruler of ’Asir against the Idrisi and Bin Saud. Bin Saud is very glad of this. Riyadh, 31st July 1920. Annexure IV to Enclosure III. Demi-official, dated the 2nd Augrust 1920.

I bes to report that just now, 6 a.m. a “bashir ”—carrier of good news—arrived and is received, as usual, with firing of rifles (about 20 shots). His good news is, I gather that the Ikhwan of the villages of Sufainah and Suwamqiyah, who had been sent out on a ghazu by the Imam ” Bin Baud (my informer s words d^ te(i ) aga i ns t Bani Abdullah, a section of Mutair, have gamed a victory The I khwan have captured the town, or village, of Bani Abdullah (Mutair) called Al-Harrah, which is said to be near Medina, to the west of Medina. Further particulars will be reported if given me by Bin Baud. p o F rol n this and previous reports I have submitted, it will be seen that Bin Baud has at the present moment no less than three ghazus, expeditions, ou ^inst Heiaz and ’Asir. I will submit fuller report as soon as I get sufficiently clear and reliable information, which is by no means easy, as I notice every one is so reticent and few are allowed near us. Annexure VI to Enclosure III. Memorandum No. H-C., date ! 1st August 1920. From— Khm Sah b Saiyid Siddiq Hasan, Indian Assistant, Bahrein (on deputa tion to Riyadh), To—The Political Agent, Bahrein. I beg to report the following few facts which I hope will be found interesting On the afternoon of 1st August, when I was calling with Farhan on Bin Saud, I noticed unusual bustle in his maktab, office, where there were three clerks writing ; , geem ed lists of things, and several persons coming in and going out again and Toafo some coming up to Bin Saud and whispering something into his ear and SingTeplies and orders in the same fashion in whisper. 1 said (getting oppor- receiv g p moment which is, as you know, so rare when you are sitting •with Bin Saud ^ho goes on rattling one thing or another without stopping to ^rrtosavl I said that I hope he had received a reply, made up his mind and bordering mirations for Haj.

C546FD 1At this juncture Bin Saud showed me an anonymous letter (written in a good literary style, so rare now-a-days in these parts) informing Bin Saud (with the highest imaginable compliments and many prayers quoted from the Quran) that both Bin Rashid and Bin Sabah had just sent letters to the Sharif (King Husain) through Salim Saderawi, a big Arab merchant of Bombay, bitterly complaining of Bin Saud’s acts, etc., and asking for alliance and help. The writer wondered what the Sharif could do at all for these “ poor beggars ” and cursed them for their folly in making the request or appeal (the anonymous writer must be some well- read person or 'ahm in Koweit, I think). I expresed surprise and said that such a request, if made, could be of little avail, but was futile. Bin Saud, who had by this time returned to his usual flow or volubility of speech, went on to say that such were the habits of Arab Chiefs who would never rest or left their neighbours rest, but must go on quarreling and fighting, robbing and killing. It was the duty of the British Government as a friendly protecting power to give serious attention to Arab affairs. He had expressed his views at great length in the course of his meeting with you (Major Dickson) and to late Captain Shakespear and Mr. Philby previously, also to Sir Percy Cox himself. He had since been writing drawing His Majesty’s Government’s attention from time to time to the unsatisfactory condition of the Jazirat-al-Arab ; but nothing came out of it all. His representations were disregarded, his friendship and good will which prompted those sincere expressions of wishes, and true faithful advice, were all set at naught. He was now feeling disappointed, nay almost affronted, f ( s . ^ .kf, T as P u ^ d own as “ khafif ” (lit. irresponsible) of little importance, or “ jahil ”, ignorant. It was quite clear to him that Government failed to appreciate him, and to realize his position, while they had made Husain bin Ali, that poor beggar with no qualities of the head or heart, “ miskin, faqir, darwesh allazi ma induh aql, wa la induh qalb,” the king and were trumpetting him all over the world as “ Al-Malik, Al-Malik,” the king the king Why did the English not see, he wondered, that if there was any one in Jazirat-al-Arab fit to be styled “ King,” it was he himself, although within himself he was proud of being called Bin Saud. He could, if he wished, become the virtual king of whole Arabia, he who took his forefathers’ capital Riyadh, back from Bin Rashid, attacking it with only a hand ful of forty camel-riders, “ Rai arbain dhalul ”, and drove the Turk from Hassa in circumstances which were known to the whole world. Perhaps he had been writing too much and too often, but he was forced by circumstances to do so. He knew Government was very busy, but it could not be so busy as not to return him one clear satisfactory reply to all his propositions. Here I interposed saying, I knew the whole correspondence and did not see what letters or communications of his remained un-answered : everything was given immediate attention and passed on to higher authorities and back, etc., etc. He said that as long as affairs were subject to reference between Bahrein and Baghdad and Cairo and London and Simla and London, mistakes are bound to occur, and reality of matters cannot be understood. Those authorities sitting at a great distance could not know the exact nature or real importance of his or other Arabs’ affairs. He would rather have Government appoint a sort of Arab Board or Committee of two or three high, impartial officials who should know all about Arabs and Arabia. They should be permanently stationed at a central place, say, Bushire or Baghdad, and fully empowered to examine and decide all questions or disputes now existing or in future arising between Arab Rulers and their decisions should be accepted and enforced as final, allowing appeal to London m rare cases only. He concluded by saying that his was a far cry which Govern ment did not hear, but that he had nearly lost patience, and would write only one more letter saying that he would not trespass upon British rights or interests nor would he trouble those who are in treaty alliance with Government but short of this he must do as he might like to support himself and the masses dependent upon him for full maintenance. r To my mind he seems impatient of the control on him burning to expand and conquer for which he is fully equipped being able to throw a mass of fiery zealots (his own creation, Ikhwan) on to any part of the country. As he says he need not to move even an inch himself, but give the word, and Arabia will be ablaze. If there is a remedy, I believe it is only a sufficiently enhanced subsidy for Bin baud, who is, in my humble opinion, worth anything. #11 Annexure VII to Enclosure III.

Shaikh Hamad reported the latest madness (as he called it) of Bin Saud was that he had issued strict orders to Bin Jaluwi, Emir of Hasa, that in future the Shiahs of Hasa and Qatif were to be forbidden to hold religious readings (Qaraiyahs) in their Hussainiyahs and that at Muharram all ceremonies in connexion with the death of Husain were to be banned. “ The order,” said Shaikh Hamad, “ had created the greatest consternation and fury among Hasa and Qatif Shiahs.” Unless the order were rescinded, Shaikh Hamad thought rebellion was sure to follow. Certainly an appeal to Great Britain would be made by Shiahs. It was a similar policy in Faisal’s time that brought about Turkish intervention in Hasa, and now Bin Saud was mad enough to try and imitate his grandfather’s mistake. Shaikh Jumaa spoke in a similar strain saying how alarmed the people of Dabai were at Bin Saud’s increasing power, Shaikh admitted that near Rasal Khaimah there existed a strong Wahhabi centre today. These were in direct communication with Bin Saud, and were becoming a menace to the peace of the Trucial coast. Shaikh Hamad further reported that a section of the Ajman hadbeen bribed by Shaikh Salim to leave ibn-Hidhlain’s camp and go into Kow r eit territory. See my telegram No. 243-C., dated the 15th August 1920. The recalcitrant section had emerged on 10th instant and raided a camp of the Manasir close to Qatif returning in safety with many camels. 2. A significant fact is that Shaikh Hamad until a short time was a hot sup porter of Bin Saud. Since Bin Shamlan from Koweit visited Bahrein Shaikh Hamad has changed his politics. In this connection please see my No. 239-C. dated J2th August 1920, paragraph 10. I personally look upon the W’hole Qatif and Hasa story with suspicion. At the same time, undoubtely Shaikh Salim is intriguing deeply in these parts, his endeavours being to create an anli-'Bm Saud atmosphere in Bahrein. Money judiciouly spent in Qatif might easily result in an outbreak, for the Qa'tifi Shiah is not particularly fond of the Bin Saud regime. In this connection also see Koweit’s telegram No. 68-C., dated the 28th July 1920 in which he reports likely trouble in Hasa. The report emanated from Shaikh Salim an looks as if it was a of i he wish being father of the thought. SG Apart from Shaikh Hamad and Shaikh Abdullah’s reports, I have heard of no such alleged orders of Bin Saud against the Shiahs complained of. Nor hava a™ local Shiahs mentioned it to me here. 7 (3) Local rumour has it that Bin Shamlan presented £ 5,000 to Shaikh Isa from Shaikh Salim. I do not credit the report. A more likely story is that the money was sent to Qatif, wLile to Shaikh Isa came only the ordinary “ } adiah ” as from mler to ruler.

People here have all cl long said that Ibn 3a ud would invent some excuse to avoid coming to Basra and to postpone the settlement oT the dispute as long as possible, so as to consolidate his influence in the disputed territory and to drai Salim*s resources in the meanwhile. Even his bitterest,enemies, how ever, never suggested that he would have the effrontery to say that it would lower his dignity to come to Basrah. As he said in his lette of^SOth October that he would only- accept you as arbitrator, he pre sumably expected you to go to him! His contention that 3alim has been the only aggressor is untenable, certainly since he signed conditions of Arbitration.

Begins:- The Shaikh of Kuwait continues to act aggressively ... bribes, some having actually gone over to Kuwait. His proposed visit to Basrah is publicly described in Kuwait as compulsory and insulting to him. He regrets that the Political Agent, Kuwait, was spreading adverse reports and also made undesirable remarks in his interview with Jufran. He believes this on the authority of Ibn Turk! and Dhaidan's letters. Ibn Sa'ud is determined to punish his disloyal subjects now in the vicinity of Kuwait, unless they be sent away from Kuwait, Jahrah and Subaihiyan. He wants above assurance early failing which he will excuse himself and send a punitive force. Ends.

His xoellency, the High Commissioner has written that bounds should not be e*ceeded in order to nrevent bldod-shed and that both parties should evacuate AL-3UBAIHIYKH, and that either party acting to the contrary will be considered as an * opposer of His Majesty’s Government 1 s orders. I now beg to ask you kindly to convey mv resnects to the High Commissioner and inform His Excellency that I am unceasing ly trying to please His Majesty’s Government in this, Koweit, affair, as well, as in other matters. It is-not hidJen from your honour that since the death of UBARAK AS-3UBAH and ever since 3ALSM AS-SUBAH has succeeded to rule, he has been always acting in all matters in onnosition to me, and I donot know the reason or cause of this attitude. During the war when goods used to go to 3YKIA (through Koweit) seeing that T was acting in accordance with His I'ajssty’s Government’s orders, he adopted a hostile attitude towards ms, seeking his own ad vantage of trade and also acting for the benefit of Turks,so much so that he exceeded all bounds by plundering my goods and those of my tribesmen in Koweit, and selling t.he same openly. This will be -proved from my previous correspondence with His Majesty’s renresentatives• I donot like that there should be any enmity between the people of Koweit and myself. * But'the Jhaikh of Koweit’s hostile attitude became such that he even sent out troops agains t my tribesmen and my country The previous correspondence regarding this with His ’ajesty’s representatives,at Bahrein and at Baghdad, will clearly show all this . I, however, avoided all disputes an enmity with Bin Bufrah \ aonly to pltjaae my frisndg, tho Hif^h British Gove^n^ent, i d'id so in tha first affair which haprjsnad at HAMADH, where my action wa3 onl y a dei9n8iv8%one« in the eecond affair at JAHRAH the above mentioned Shaikh squipned his troons and collected GHAMMAR with the intention of attacking ny tribes which actually barren ed. 'hen Hia Majesty’s Government interveined for neace and I agreed. Subsequently, DAIJ AS-SUBAH made a raid in countraven- tion of those orders, but God defeated bin and he had to ret-eat. \He made several more raids and plundered p^ooerty and killed many men. Later, they encanred at JAHRAh, of which I info^msd you beforehand, and then in writing, and also oersonaliy sxnlain^ ed to the High Commissioner and your honour; but it was apparent- ly of no use. hat was ordained to barren, took rlace, ani T haveacquainted you with the full details of the whole arf alr and its causes both from my own knowledge and according to the letter of Ad- DAW I SH* I now request you to inform His Excellency the High Commissioner that I accent what he has ordered me to do, and i guarantee that there shall be no further attack arainst Koweit, nor shall 3UBAIHIYSH or JAHRAH be occupied by my troops until the question of Koweit is finally settled, under the aus pices of Government. I would, however, ask for two conditions : firstly. Government should guarantee that no hostile movement or advance will be made from Koweit and that none of the tribes opposed to me like GRAMMAR and their kind shouli mo to him ( Biff SUBAH); secondly, that none of my disloyal tribes of MUTaIF AJMaN or those* connected with then are seduced or sheltered by Bin Bubah. If the Government guarantee this, I shall also under take to do what 1 have stated above. But if Bin 3ubah makes the least move or goes out of the territories of Koweit, or arnrocch es any of the water-wells at AL-JAHRAH or AL-SUBAIKIY^H, then I shall not be responsible for the result but he alone will be to blame, as 1 am bound, in that case, to defend my country, aM punish whoever oomes forward to protect my tribesmen.

This is, no doubt, unbecoming for both sides. His Majesty’s Government awd Myxaifx as well as myself* lour Government have been constantly forbidding me to act against Bin Subah, and in return he has been catching hold of my own foolish and disloyal tribesmen, and giving them bribes. And if I neglect him, you are well aware of the condition of the Bedouins and the ill-disposed* The number of men who will be thus persuaded to go over to him will ro on increasing.

On morning of 26th December Danish with a porce of Ikhwan estimated at 150/300 horsemen and 300/400 camel-riders attacked a camp of ft ‘AJman and Rashaidah at Mutla*, three miles north-west of Jahrah, , and captured their camels and sheep, killing a large number of them. On evening of 27 th December the Ikhwan were still at Zaghlah, about - , . &gt; ■•/i fifteen miles north west of Jahrah. Shaikh has sent *Ali al-Khalifai Da*ij, etc., with available tribesmen to resist possible attack on Jahrah.

To Hicom, Baghdad; repeated to Bushire &amp; Bahrain. No. 2G4-C. Dated 29 th December 1920. Reference my telegram No. 203“G. The camp attacked was at Zaghlah itself, and not at Mutla*. Dawish stopped there till the 28th., as his son ‘Uzalylz was severely wounded and not expected to live, tfomen refugees from there arriving Jahrah on the 28th say all men captured alive were killed and some women raped. Ikhwan said they had permission to visit Zubair for musabalah. They purposed making Safwan a base from which to raid. They left for Ghadhal on the morning of the 28th. The Shaikh is very much perturbed at the rumour about Zubair and Safwan. He has written me a letter which I am posting to you, the gist of which is as follows:- Begins: He replied to your communi cation regarding Jahrah as reported in my telegram No.189-0. He has stopped all aggression as ordered by Government. Ibn Sa*ud, however, is not doing so, as on 26th December Dawish with a force of Ikhwan attacked his tribes who were not prepared, as he had not thought that Ibn Sa*ud would order an attack in defiance of Government's orders. On hearing this he sent reinforcements to Jahrah. He has now heard that Dawish is going to Zubair, but does not know why. He asks me to inform you. Ends. Ibn Sa'ud will presumably say he is punishing his disloyal tribes. In this connection I learn that the Shaikh is building on our ruling regarding the 'Awazim, contained in Bushire telegram No. 1609 of 6 th September. He argues from this that any tribes which come over to him ipso facto become his, and cease to b» Ibn Sa'ud'sTranalation of a letter, 18th HaM* ath-Thanl 13&gt;9 ( 29 th D*o«i3b«r 19^0 ), from H # £• tho Shaikh of Kuwait to th« PolitioaX A^iOt, Kuwait* After ooapXiaonts* With referenow to your letter No. 888, relative to the tolosraa which you had rwooivod froa Sir Pwroy Cox, ordering ao not to maintain a lar^o for gw at Jahrah undwr ay war fla&amp;. I infomwd you at the tiaw in iay Iwttwr dated the 17 th Rabi* al-Auw&amp;l ( 29 th November ) that I had no intention of maintaining a large force at Jahrah, but merely a email garrison for defence only. I have done nothing contrary to his orders, and have ceased froa hostile movements in obedience to the orders of Government. Ibn Sa'ud, however, is not stopping his aggression, as three days ago Faisal ad~Dawish, with a large force of Xkhwan, attacked my tribes to the west of Jahrah, seised their property and killed some of their \ men. They were not expecting anything of the sort, as I had not thought that Ibn Sa’ud would order an attack in defiance of the orders of Government. On hearing this news I sent Salman al-lb/aud and Da’iJ with some reinforcements to defend Jahrah. I told Abdul Latif to explain this to you yesterday. I have now reoelved information that Dawish has gone towards Zubair, but I do not know with what objeot. I am accordingly laying the matter before you, and hope you will givw it your consideration, and will Inform Sir Percy Cox of this aggression. As ordered by Government I have ceased doing anything contrary to her wishes, and I am much sur prised at these movements.

The Shaikh of Muhamraarah, who is here on a visit, has Just been to see me about the quarrel between Ibn Sa'ud and Shaikh Salim. He thinks that as Ibn Sa’ud has once refused to come to Basrah he will continue to make excuses and things' will go from bad to worse and he i 1 says with truth that the state of fear in which the people of Kuwait are now in is distressing. He suggests that his son Chasib should go to Riyadh at once, accompah nied by Ahmad al-Jabir and a couple of Kuwait merchants, to try and make peace, taking a letter from you to the effect that he is coming merely as a peace-maker and not in any sense of the word as an arbitrator. He thinks he would succeed in making peace and that once that were done the final settlement of the dispute would be easy. Even were he to fail it would not make things worse than at present. He asks me to request you to reply as early as possible as he wishes to return to Muhammarah on Saturday. He says that if you agree Shasib can start as soon as he gets back and can have his boat coaled. He further suggests that if you agree to this proposal Ibn Baud be not told before Ghasib starts for fear he raise objection s.

Am communicating measa&amp;e to Shaikh. ^Public opinion in Kuwait does not seem to be opposed to Salim's present policy regarding Jahrah. People do not believe Ibn Sa'ud’s promise that he will not attack Kuwait and they look on Jahrah as \ an outpost for its defence. Much resentment is felt at recent levy- ing of m«n,\ but it is directed against Ibn Sa'ud rather than Salim. Some bitterness is also lelt against us for not bringing pressure to bear on Ibn ba'ud. This feeling, which was strong at the time of the battle of Jahrah, died down with the advent of His Majesty's ships and aeroplanes but is increasing again now. Some people are delighted at rumoured raid by Ikhwan to the west of Zubair as they tnink this will force us to bring pressure to bear on Ibn Sa*ud. I had hopes that Shaikh Khaz'al might give Salim useful advice, but on sounding him I saw that he too thought his policy of using seceded tribes, etc., was sound.

Yes, that is the position temporarily; our object must be to reconcile the parties and &amp;et them to a^ree not to harbour tribes which secede from each other. Try to ftet Shaikh Salim to realize the weakness of his position at the present political juncture. It is contrary to our policy and wishes that he should feet entangled in intrigues with King Husain and Ibn Rashid for the purpose of attacking Ibn Sa*ud, and he will come up against us if he does so. As long as he maintains correct relations with Ibn Sa'ud, we can give him a good deal of moral support to prevent Ibn Sa'ud from annoying him. On the other hand, if he insists in quarreling with Ibn Sa'ud in the Interior, we can not give him effective help, and are only con cerned with the protection of the port of Kuwait from attack. If he persists in his present course, our only remedy must be to find a Shaikh who will,manage his politics better than Salim.

Including villagers he has not more than 700 men now in Jahrah, the rest of his tribesmen being towards Malah, etc. As many townsmen have property in Jahrah and, as it is viewed as first line of defence for Kuwait, everyone approves of his policy of keeping this force there (In this I think he speaks the truth). Regarding seceders, he is most emphatic that that he did nothing whatever to seduce them from their allegience to Ibn Sa'ud, but that they came over entirely on their own. As they have come to r - ■.

I and mine are under the protection of Government and I trust we be always regarded as under the shadow of her Justice. I beg you to consider the matter and help me to do what is honourable.

There is also a ssction of people who think that all available men should be concentrated in Xuv*ait for the defence of the place itself, and that 300/400 are ample for Jahrah. A few even realize that a larye force there is a positive danger, bein,y nothing but a challenge to Dawish. It has become known too that to collect a lar^e force there is contrary to our advice, and they look on it as madness to oppose us. ( , \' i * ■ , The feeling atainat Salim is becoming very strong ayain and revolutionary talk is increasing. They realize that Salim is the chief obstacle to peace, as the quarrel is purely a personal one between him and Ibn 3a T ud and, whichever is in the ri^ht, he is the easier ^ot rid of.

Dated lOth February 1921. Universal opinion in Kuwait is that Ibn Sa'ud will welcome Ghasib k Ahmad most cordially and that he will say that there is nothing he wants more than peace and friendship With Kuwait. Some think, however that he will say that Salim is too ^reat a stumbling block, and that he can only maintain good relations by corresponding with Ahmad in future and not with Salim. I have heard this both from men of Palace circle like 1 Abdul Latif* and also from merchants. General opinion is that the Mission will succeed in stopping hostilities but that the truce will be short lived, as,(a) according to the Palace circle Ibn 3a*ud will invent some excuse for recommencing his aggression, or (b) according to the Opposition, either that will happen or Salim ^ will start intriguing again. It has come to my knowledge that a proposal is now being discussed m by some of the merchants for a deputation to come to the Agency and ask His Majesty’s Government to force Salim to sfet up a Council of r , some half dozen notables, including Ahmad, as regular advisers, as hney think this the only means, short of deposing Salim, of making a permanent peace possible. I fancy Hamad as-Saqar is one of the originators of the idea (see my No 87-0 of 28th August).. * I should be glad of instructions how to reply if such a deputation should call on me. Personally I think a small Council might do some ^ood, as at present Salim is practically in the liands of Mulla Salih. I would suggest for your consideration that I might reply that we are not prepared to interfere with the interior affairs of Kuwait' by ordering Salim to rule his people in any particular way, but that we will advise him to accede to their wish and set up a council. I think that were we to give him such advice and he did not take it, ' tne people would probably solve the whole problem by removing him themselves.Tele^am (Code). From Resident, Bushire.

No. 51-C. Dated 11th March 1921. j / Messengers sent from Kuwait to Najd with notification of Salim*s death returned evening of 10th March with letters from Mission Sc Ibn Sa'ud to Subah family and to Shaikh Khaz*al. Mission met Ibn Sa*ud at Kafar al-*Akk (pronounced ^c^ 1 *), 115 miles north of Riyadh on 2nd March, and started back for Hasa on 5th. News of Salim*s death had reached them from Bahrain on 4th March. Before this was known Ibn Sa*ud had said he felt nothing but friend- ship towards people of Kuwait and Subah family, with the exception of Salim. Salim had brought all recent troubles on his own head by declaring war on the Mutair, etc. Ibn Sa*ud wanted nothing better than that there should be friendship between Najd and Kuwait, but Salim was the great obstacle. He thought however that peace was pos sible if Ahmad al-Jabir would act for him in all dealings with himself He drew up a document laying down a frontier for Kuwait which he said he would recognise at once. The Maqta* stream, which flows into sea seventy five miles south south-east bf Kuwait, formed part of this, but what it was further west is not ‘known. Then came news of Salim's death and Ibn Sa'ud tore up the document % and said that the two houses were once again united in perfect friend ship and that there was no.longer any need of any boundary. Ahmad The above is chiefly from statement of messengers as letters give little information. Shaikh Khaz'al who is here will send 'Ivy' to Bahrain for mission which is due at Kasa on 13th March Sc should reach Kuvfait about 18th. to Artawiyah. Some say he intends to punish Dawish who is getting out of hand, but more general belief is that his real objective is Hail.

The news on / my side is that in these days some of the Akhwans who live in the north went cut with their cattle with the object of grazing ;they are in the neighbourhood of the ' Jabal“ (Shammar ). They attacked and defeated them (shammar)with the help of God ;and after defeating the tribesmen they chanced to meet Ibn Rashid who was coming out from his town with the intention of aggressing them; but God helped them against him and consequently they defeated him and killed about 150 cf the M Hadhar M (town-people) and of the Bedouins about 200 men and took from his camels about 300 and captured a machine gun which Pin Rashid had with him • The latest news about him is that he was in ‘•Akkash M about an heur journey from Hail • I have also received a letter from Bin Ibrahim Amir of Zubair men tioning that when Ad-Duwish raided the tribesmen rear Zubsir he tc®k seme property (camels)belonging to the inhabitants of Zubair and requesting me to return it* I have written a letter the copy of which you will undoubtedly peruse as I have sent it t© my agent Abdul Aziz Al-Qasaibi frcm whom you can obtain a copy of it .

At meeting between Ahmad and Ibn Sa'ud both agreed that there was no longer any boundary dispute between them or any need for a fixed frontier between their territories, and Ahmad seems quite satisfied with arrangement. I entirely agree with your proposal for ending question of arbitra tion, but venture to make the following suggestions;- (1) That the islands mentioned in Article 5 of the Anglo-Turkish Oonventlon be also specifically recognised as belonging to Kuwait© (2) That you add a clause to the effect that if either of them should consider it desirable to have a definite frontier .deliniated, you hope that, with the cordial relations which happily now exist betwean them, they will be able to discuss the question themselves in a friendly spifcit and merely refer to you if any point arrlse or for final approval of their agreement. (3) To avoid any possibility of our motives being misunderstood 4 in our own interests, I would suggest that the northern face of the green linegpeon line be definitely fixed/al as the frontier between Kuwait &amp; Mesopotamia* From the north west corner, where it touches the Batin, the line might run due south till it meets the red line west of Kuwait© When Salim showed me the draft of Appendix 2 of his letter of 17th September (vide my memorandum No* 101-0 of the same date) I pointed out that the northern frontier hardly came into the question, but he was very keen that it also should be included.

Before leaving for Cairo I addressed to you three letters dated 15th February and one dated 18th February tlirou^ Political Agent, nahrain. I trust they reached you safely. I i**a now able to inform you of the decision of Bis Majesty 1 s Government regarding t o more of the questions which were then outstanding between us namely: Firstly the amount of financial help which Uie British (fovemaent feel able to continue to afford to you ancl Secondly the question of your title in the future as ruler of your territories. In regard to the first matter I am now informed that hie Majesty’s Government after full discussion feel unable owing to the very stringent financial situation that exists in England ( as well' as in other countries who were engaged in the late war) to accept the recommendations madein your bohalf in full* '.The i-l.'-nt i or^ourable t} e ecretary of i tate was moot sympathetic at the Conference and I am sure gave all the help that he possibly could but it will not be hidden fro® you that the Cabinet of His Majesty v e Government is obliged to consider ouch a matter not only by itself on its own particular merits but also in conjuntien with several other parallel cases and it was considered that full com* pliance with eur recoiasendationB Made in regard to yourself would have placed his Majesty’s Government in a very embarrassing position in relation to other friends* Eventually it was decided Chat the present subsidy of £ 5000/- per month should be continued to you and that in case at the present Juncture you might be troubled with any temporary inconvenience a special cash gift of £ 20,000/- in addition to the subsidy for the current month should be now afforded to you. X should explain that this friendly decision and others dbich are under discussion are of course contingent upon Your Excellency’s faithful observance of certain preliminary stipulations which I will specify later in this letter, but which indeed differ little from those which have always existed between yourself and ay government in the past, before leaving this subject of your finances, X think it well to explain to Your Excellency that I a® authorised to assure you, that at any rate. It is not the intention of His Majesty’s Government to afford to Ris High ness the Uherif of Mecca any greater financial assistance than they are fixing for yourself. Of that you may rest assured. The second matter is the question of your assumption of a royal title. In this connection it gives your frisnd much pleasure to be the medium of intimating to you that should you see fit at the desire or with the consent of your subjects© pif to as sum th» title of Suit an of JKeJd and its dependencies, His Majesty's GoYerrasent sill be prepared to accord their recognition of ouch a title* The title shich I hare cited above eeeins to be the moat suitable and natural one for Your Honour to assume and 1 think this mo your own vies also* Accordingly in regard to this matter I shall await a furtiier communication or announcement from yourself* As regards tl e question of your boundaries with Keweit, Praise be to God, t is difficulty has been greatly simpli fied by Ahmad bin ^aabar's accession to the Siaikhship and by bis satisfactory meeting with you* The present position therefore is as follows Please refer to my letter of the 15th Vebruary* The territory included in the Ked Circle is shat His Majesty’s Government have definitely recognised to be the undisputed territory of ,the :$ialkhdom of Aoweit and that being the ease they count on Your l xcellency's acceptance of that decision* As regards the territory lying between the red and green lines on the Map it is perhaps superfluous now* in view of the satisfactory understanding which lias been reached between yourself and dhaikh Ahmad bin doabar to pursue the question of your claims or his claims within this outer area. I Should like your views on this point* that is to say whether you wish to pursue the miter further or wish to leave it as it is. The best plan would seem to be for you and .'Shaikh Ahmad bin daabar to come to a friendly understanding and inform me what solution you have reached. Two other matters which I should wish to discuss are the question of tills year’s pilgrimage and the status of Khurma and Turabah. As regards the former I have info mod His Majesty's Government that you have had considerable difficulty in4. lU ✓ in prohibiting your subjects from undertaking the HaJ for the rast two seasons running; that you cannot see your way to do this a third tine and consider it essential that these who wish to proceed this year should be allowed to do so* Further that while it is obviously not possible for your subjects to nuke the journey without arms for self~pretectlen, nevertheless you are prepared to give full assurances that they shall Indulge in no active aggression against the Uherlf or his subjects during their passage through Kejaz territory* In return for this assurance X am asking that assurances may also be taken from His highness the ?&amp;erif that he will reciprocate the above undertakings and that your subjects will be given the same consideration as other pilgrims* X trust this will appear satisfactory and reasonable to you* Then as regards the status of Khunaa and Turaboh t 1 have informed the Secretary of otate that in view of the ' difficulty at the present juncture of arranging for any hritish Commission to proceed to the spot for deciding the status and fixing boundaries of that region* the best solution and one which l am sure will be accepted by your self would appear to be that His Majesty's Government should announce that they consider Khurma and Turabah to be in a position of local Independence or autonomy under a Governor chosen by themselves* and that the latter will detl wit} the nejaz uoveraaent ii ■ tters concerning Hejaz and similarly with lour Excellency in matters concerning your government and your tribes* I trust you will inform me of your approval of such a solution* ilie last thing that X have to touch upon is the subject of the conditions of which His hiajesty's Government ask your acceptance in return for their friendly support of your \ interests as above indicated* These conditions are:-«4v , ^ 5 (i) iTnat you rofrain and restrain your adJierents fro» aggressive action against tine Kejas, Koweit and Iraq (ii) that you afford co-operation in the matter of the K&amp;J by maintaining the safety of pilgrims routes to your territory (iii) that you consent tc be guided generally by the wishes » of His Majesty^ Government in regard to your foreign policy cn 1 tc co-operate with them in promoting their own policy ? iih has for its object the maintenance of peaceful conditions in Arab countries and the promotion of the economic interests of both parties. Uvj X must explain to you confidentially tl^at the question of the future form of Government and the rulership of the independent Arab • t&amp;te of Iraq is one ehieh will ) to be d cided within the next few months. 2he attitude of his Majesty 9 s Government in this metier io : tills, uubjeet to the reservation that the future | ruler r;iuBt* be one they regard as suitable, they desire to be guided by the wishes of the majority of tie people of Iraq.

Tour friend wishes greatly that he could have had the advantage of a meeting with you at this important juncture but it hardly seems pcosille, as I cannot leave here just now. Failing that I had hoped to send a trusted representative to discuss these matters fully with you btit that again owing to * the season and the uncertainty of your own movements does not appear feasible. I have been obliged therefore to have recourse to a letter in the first instance which will be supplemented by full explanations by Ahmed Beg Thanayan. I very much hope that the letter will find you in the best of health and your affairs prospering. (sd) I. Cox High Commissioner./ Secret . Office of the High Commissioner Baghdad 19th May 1921. No.SD//^/^' To, The Political Agent., Kuwait. Memorandum . Your telegram Ho. 73/C dated 27. 4. 21. The High Commissioner has had under careful consideration the question of the settlement of the boundary dispute between Kuwait and Ibn Saud, and a copy of his despatch dated 4th May 1921 to the address of Ibn Saud was forwarded to you under cover of my Secret endorsement dated May 10th Ho. SD/1165 Your telegram suggests that an endeavour should now be made to reach a decision on all outstanding boundary questions to the view that the time is hardly ripe for a complete and permanent settlement. The local situation it is true^is at present tranquil but it is still fluid, and it remains to be seen how far Ibn Saud may make good in the area enclosed between the red and the green lines. His successoB^ai failure in this direction must affect tjae desiderata of the Mesopotamian State and till these are known progress has been made. As regards the area enclosed in the n/i/i / as they affect Kuwait. His Excellency however is disposed discussion would be inopportune. Nevertheless considerable Red circle we are definitely committed: any Shaikh of Kowait4 may cla.im it at any time and we should have to support it. This has been clearly pointed out to Ibn Saud. With regard to the Islands the question has never been raisedby Ibn Saud and the presumption is that they go without saying as part of Article 5 of the agreement. It would not be expedient to open discussion. Your proposal that the dispute between Ibn Saud and the Shaikh of Kuwait should be discussed between the Rulers in a friendly spirit has not been overlooked and Ibn Saud has been invited to discuss with the Shaikh of Kuwait the boundary question of the area lying between the green and the red lines.

Shaiich Sir ’Abdul ’Aziz bin 'Abhor Rahman al-paisal as“Sa*ud, G.C.I.E., Sultan of Najd Dependencies, to the effect that he had carefully studied all his records dealing with the territorial dispute regarding which both he and the Ruler of Kuwait had asked him to arbitrate. He said that H.H. was doubtless aware that the question of the territory of the subject of negotiations between H.M‘s Government and the Sublime porte in 1331, as a result of which an agreement was drawn up with a map appended thereto, from which the lines on the attached map were taken. The two Govern ments agreed that the port of Kuwait and the territory es-the within the red line on the map would be considered as the autonomous territory of the Ruler of Kuwait. This line starts frora the southern bank of the mouth of the Khaur as-Zubair and, with the Town of Kuwait as centre,describes a semi-circle, and, passing to the south of Qur&amp;in, meets the sea just south of Ras al-Qulal'ah, opposite Qaru Island. H.M*s Government considered that. In view of this convention, the above territory belonged to the Ruler of Kuwait beyond dispute. In the same convention it is stated that the British and Turkish Governments came to an understanding regarding the territory within the green line on the map in question. This line starts from the south side of the Khaur az-Zubair, at its Junction with the Khaur 'Abdullah, and passes to the south of Uram Qasr, Safwan and jabal ganam. on reaching the Batin it turns south-west and follows the Batin to Hafar-al“Batin inclusive. It then turns south-west, and includes the wells of sfifah, Qar ah, and Wabrah and the village of Anta* andfinallj Jolna th« aoa at Jabal ManIfah . H,M*b Gov«rnaBnt and th« Sublin* porte a^rB«d that th« country within this boundary should be treated as a special area. The Ottonan Government undertook not to send any garrison there and to abstain from all military operations within it, without first consulting H.M's Government; she further agreed that she would not undertake anything of an administrative nature there except in conjunction with the Ruler of Kuwait. The two Governments agreed that the territory situated between the red and green limes should be held as that within which the Ruler of Kuwait was entitled to levy tribute. H.E. said that he was prepared to go into the matter fur“ ther provided that both Rulers agreed to accept the following conditions which would remain in force until a final decision was arrived at:- Neither Ruler would establish any permanent settlement or occupy any of the water holes with an armed force but on the contrary this territory would be considered as not belonging to either, though the wells could be freely used by either party until the question was finally settled. H.E, was writing a similar letter to the late shaikh Salim but Just then his death occurred. In a letter dated 13th Shauwal, jbn sa*ud replied to H.E. and said that he had already given H.E. authority to settle the dellmination of the boundaries between his territories and those of Kuwaitv and that as H.M’s Government had decided to consider the zone between jahrah and Subaihiyah, namely the land within the red circle as belonging to Kuwait, he agreed with their decision He said, however, that the land between the red and green lines was his undisputable property, and that Your Excellency had acknowledged this during your visit to Najd. He added that, as long as the friendly relations which have happily been resumed continue between y.E. arid him he would extend tils protection to the cattle of natives of Kuwait during their travels in the territories of Rajd. H.E. has not discussed the question of the boundaries any further with Ibn Sa*ud, but he instructs me to inquire fromC0NFID3MTIA.L &lt;S&gt; 9 No. 181-C Political Agency, ,Kuwait'. 24th October 1921.

I have also discussed the matter verbally with Shaikh Ahmad, and he says that, although he is perfectly satisfied with the understanding which he arrived at with Ibn Sa’ud when in Najd that no frontier was necessary between their respective territories, and although he would be loath to have the question raised at the present juncture when his relations with Ibn Sa’ud are so friendly, yet at the same time he does not relinquish his claims to the larger frontier.

My own opinion is that (a) in the interests of Kuwait it is preferable not to raise the Kuwait - Najd frontier question again until it can be finally settled and that that can only be done when the conference eventually takes place; (b) from, the 'Iraq point of view it hardly £4 seems necessary now that DawiSh has retired to Artawiyah as I should say there is little fear of Ibn Sa'ud ordering or allowing him to return to raid 'Iraq tribes in the near future.

No. 181-0 of 24th October) he might not even like to to risk impairing 4 his relations with him by requesting them to go.
