The procedure which you outlined will greatly assist us in dealing with our batches of American personnel who will be going to Kuwait this summer, and we very much appreciate your assistance. Just a day or two before the receipt of your letter, we forwarded to Kuwait the names of the undermentioned American personnel in respect of whom we requested our Management in Kuwait to apply for no objection certificates to be cabled to you. In order to save time, perhaps you would kindly request the Passport Control Department to arrange for the issue of the necessary visas without waiting to hear from the Political Agent in Kuwait for confirmation. tftaf Edwin Martin FISHER Jacob Eugene RICHEY &lt; ^ Walter Odell SPIERS James Kenneth BRIDGES George MILLER David Rolland GOOCH Howard Elbert REDDING Snr Roscoe Thomas ARMSTRONG Walter Bryan GUESS Glen Deward UNDERWOOD Paul Benjamin C&amp;RTLEDGE Hubert Logan ARMSTRONG Sterling W.

If you agree that there is no objection in principle to the entry of the remaining total of 56 American drillers we should inform the Koweit Oil Company accordingly and ask them to send the details of future visa requirements as they arise direct to the India Office.

I am informing the Company accordingly. Yours sine erely,TELEPHONE! HOLBORN 8434. The Bahrein Petroleum Company, Limited Pjf £**-*** Cliffords Inn. London, E.C.4. 8th Augus' Dear Mr. Harrison, ^ — I understand that the man Berentsen, a Norwegian who has applied to the British Embassy, Oslo for a Visa for Bahrein, is a former employee of this Company, although not recently so; in other words, the new Service Contract would not be a continua tion of service after leave. It appears that the Company^ Harbour Master at Bahrein is a Norwegian, and seven or eight Norwegians have been recruited during recent years for service as Assistant Harbour Masters, Mooring Masters, and such like, in and about the Sitrah Channel. The recruitment of Norwegians has, I am told, been a wartime necessity. There is still, I believe, a scarcity of British people qualified for these tasks but the fact does remain that this man has received his invitation to rejoin the Company, direct from Bahrein; he has not been recruited through London. If you can see your way to permitting the proposed employ- “ this man, it would b e of sane convenience to the Company i it is doubtful whether a suitable substitute could be &gt;d in Gt. Britain at the present time - in other words, it !e a convenience if you would permit the Company to forego this belief to the proofI might add that we are writir^ to Bahrein reminding them of the terms of the Concession regarding the employment of British Subjects in Bahrein.

The Under Secretary of State for India, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. Sir, In connection with the resumption of operations by this Company in Kuwait, we beg to apply for permission for Mr. T. E.

At the present time he is in New York dealing with various matters necessary to the resumption of operations. We are of the opinion that his employment in Kuwait is desirable for the efficient carrying on of the undertaking. We beg, therefore, to request that H.M. Government will consent to the employment of Mr. Patrick and to his being accompanied to Kuwait by his wife and family. Betails of the individuals concerned are as follows:- 1. Thomas Edison Patrick, born Spindle Top, Texas November 17th, 1910. 2. Mrs Johnnie Patrick born Hamilton Texas January 10th 1914. 5 . Thomas Patrick (Junior) born Dallas Texas December 7th 1959* Paula Lee Patrick born Hamilton Texas December 17th 1941. INDIA lFFICE 4The parents of Mr. and Mrs. Patrick are American. If consent is given, we should be glad if a cable could be despatched to the British Consul, New York, authorising him to issue visas for the journey to Kuwait. It is hoped that Mr. and Mrs. Patrick and family will leave New York for Kuwait about 15 th June. We are Sir, Your obedient servants. ^BecretaryCentral 742-2 Telegrams: Inland : Kuoco, Telex.

For this purpose it will be necessary to recruit drilling staff. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (one of the partners in Kuwait Oil Company) is endeavouring to make a number of men available for those operations. There is, however, a shortage of qualified drillers and it is proposed to recruit a number of men in the U.S.£. for'service in Kuwait. We are of the opinion that their employment is desirable for the efficient carrying on of the undertaking. We beg, therefore, to request that H.H. Government will consent to the employment of the following:- 1. Andrew Woodard Higginbotham, born Grapeland Texas 22nd October, 1902 2. Homer Littleton Lively, born Augusta Texas 1st December, 1894 .
