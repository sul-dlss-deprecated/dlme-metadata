To Yds 3ritannic !ajesty*8 Political yxgent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that a matter has recently come to ray notice which raises some douht in my nind as to whether the Customs department is at preaent receiv ing the correct duty on petrol snd kerosene imported from i .badan by the Agents of the Anglo Persian Oil Conpsny, limited. 2. Palm Tree kerosene is invoiced by the Anglo Persian Cil Comr-jny, :.I.F at h.il/6 per tin. The prime co^t in Bahrain 1 ■ 'Id b e; - One tin of 4 galxons tis I. 6. J.

The bazaar sale orices (retail) of a tin of Kerosene —Keroaene Oil b&amp;i are for a quantity of one thousand tins .about Ks 2/2 per tin, and by the single tin at about £s 2/9. , this price varying with the supply and demand, and is sometimes higher. Thus the value of a tin of Kerosene Oil in Bahrain is considerably rnoro tnan the invoiced irice. 3. aviation Spirit is invoiced at as 3/2 per tin and the prime cost in 3ahrain would be very nearly:- J* One tin of 4 gollons as 3. 3. 0.

The local sale nrice is hi 9/8, but customs duty is paid ad valcrem on the invoice value of Sx 3/2 per tin, which T think is too low, having regurd to the Bahrain value (not the .xbadan value) of a tin of aviation Spirit. A. There may possibly^some explanation for the very large difference between the invoice value and the value in Bahrain, but unless this can be satisfsctorily explained, I think it would be justifiable when charg ing customs duty to take into consider* tion the price at which it is sold locally and to disregard the invoice price. I should be obliged ii you would let me have your opinion on the matter. I have the honour to be, Sir. ^our obedient servant. Adviser to the Government.- &gt; No* 5 77/7/1/n, Political Agency, Bahrain, the 7th April 1934, . The Agent, Anglo Persian Oil Conqpany Limited, Bahrain , Dear Sir, I beg to request that you will kindly inforra me at what rates you sell (a) kerosene oil, (b) motor spirit and (c) aviation spirit# It would be convenient if you would show separately the prices of the different qualities and, also, the rates for the sale of considerable quantities (say 1000 tins) and for single tins. It is understood that the tin in such cases is a four gallons tin. Yours faithfully, Lieut-Colonel, Political Ardent, Bahrain#Dated, the 19th April 1934# Dear de Jrenier, .vould yoa kindly let we know the invoice rate| for the parpoees of Customs duty, which is placed on B«P« Motor spirit imported by the \n^lo-?erslan Oil Company Linit«d # Yours slnceroly f C»C#L« de Grenier Esquire, Director of Custorns iind Port Officer, »'/ ** /{ - fa IBjeii al iiBlitirxr, IBafjrjein, ^jersian 05xrlf» iAjyf-ct Azv A In reply to your No:668-7/1 of the 19th April, 1-934, I would explain that the Customs duty levied upon B,P.Motor'Spirit is a fixed duty of four annas per tin of four gallons. This rate was so fixed in accordance with the Ahlan of H.E.The Deputy Ruler on 11th Ra.jab 1350, (corresponding with 21st November 1931); and the commodity was thus placed upon the Customs Tariff. Consequently the value invoiced to their local Agent 'by The Anglo-Persian Oil Company Ltd of Abadan is disregarded for Customs purposes. 1 enclose herewith for your inspection and return the duplicate Bill of Kntry No:3520, which will show the rates at which other commodities sold by this Company are invoiced to their Agent at Bahrain.

I enclose for your information a copy of Customs notice No.66/466 dated 22nd January 1934. The Director of Customs and Port Officer has suggested that Customs duty upon^above commodities should be collected upon a fixed rate (i.e., uDon the Customs Tariff), and that this method would be simpler and more effective than the present method, which may raise some discus sion between the concerned as to how the real Bahrain value of these commodities may be arrived at, please. c.e fZsr' Adviser to the Government ■ T n ^ 4- ——■■■ ^ /X v No. 526/VII/39.

IA S' U X~r 2, We should agree that the proposed King^s Fegulation is intra vires Article 70(b) of the Order-in-Council but, in the absence of any explanation of the necessity for the Regulation, have some doubt whether in this instance it would be appropriate to oaks the Bahrein Regulations applicable as they stand* In the first place, though it is not for us to criticise the enactments of the Bahrein Government, [the Regulations themselves appear to be neither clear or complete. For instance, though n dutiable articles• , and 'duty' are mentioned, there is nothing in the Kegulations to define these terras or to show how they are related to the customs tariff set out in the schedule* I oreover, the authority empowered to impose penalties or to confiscate goods in respect of which an offence has been coomltted is nowhere # specified by name; though it aight be inferred from paragraph 8^ that ueoisicns are uade by the Bahrein customs officer, subject to an appeal to the Bahrein Governmen -Q I feel sure that on consideration you will agree that it would not be appropriate that British subjects and foreigners should be completely subjected to the jurisdiction of the Bahrein Government in this manner, since it uoee not a jear that there is any appeal i rocj the Bahrein Government to the Political gent's Court or to the Chief Court* 5.

On the other hand, if you consider that there would be advantage in bringing persons subject to the .rder-in- Council into with Bahrein subjects in customs matters (as I believe is the case in Muscat) perhaps the first step would be to induce the Bahrein aoveimcent to introduce a set of rules and regulations which could be applied to both categories* In this connection you may care to hare an examination made of the ordinances and rules in force in Aden, of which I enclose copies.

For instance, though 'dutiable articles' and 'duty' are mentioned, there is nothing in the Regu lations to define these terms or to show how they are related to the Customs Tariff set out in the schedule. Moreover, the authority empowered to impose penalties or to confiscate goods in respect of which an offence has been conmitted is nowhere specified by name; though it might be in ferred from paragraph 8A that decisions are made by the Bahrain Customs Officer, subject to an appeal to the Bahrain Government*' 3, These criticisms of the draft Regulations seem to me valid and there may be other defects in them (as applied to British subjects or foreigners), which I have not noticed or which only the working would reveal. 4. The following seem to be alternative courses for providing that the Bahrain Government has ample powers to deal with Custom's offences by Europeans. (1) Articles 26 and 27 of the Bahrain Order-in-Council read as follows:- '260 If any person to whom this Order applies smuggles or imports into or exports from Bahrein any goods whereon any duty is charged or payable to the Sheikh of Bahrain, with intent to evade payment of the duty, he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two months, or with the fine which may extend to 1,000 rupees, or a sura equal to treble the value of the goods (whichever shall be the greater), or with both imprisonment and fine. 27. If any person to whom this Order applies smuggles or imports into or exports from Bahrain any goods the importation or exportation whereof is lawfully prohibited, he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to 2,000 rupees, or a D.0. No.1562-7/1 -1\y - 2 - sum equal to treble the value of the goods (whichever shall be the greater), or with irnprisonraent and fine.' These can be supplemented by King's Regulations, for example specifying coraraocities which are dutiable or prohibited by reference to Regulations of the Bahrain Government from time to time in force, qx (2) If it is desiiable that British subjects and foreigners should ba subject to precisely the same regu lations as Bahrain subjects then your Regulation would have to be re-drafted to meet the defects I have mentioned above. If you consider doing this, the ordinances and rules which are in force in Aden of which I enclose copies may be of some assistance. Kindly return them when you have finished with them.

Dear Belgrave, Perhaps you may remember, as Gahan tells me, that you passed orders that customs dues should be paid now on his Standard car which he wishes to export as he is leaving for Karachi. The car was originally \ imported by me,and, as I was a Political Officer (I was Secretary to the Political Resident at that time), the Director of Customs was good enough to refund to me the customs dues. When I was leaving for England last sum mer, I sold the car to Uchi as I did not then know whether I was going to return here. I did not - indeed it never occurred to me - tell Uchi that he would have to pay the customs dues and no doubt he never mentioned the matter to Gahan, 2. If Customs dues are now to be paid, I think I should probably pay them,and not Gahan. My case, however, is not an isolated one e.g. the Political Resident sold a small Austin car which he imported here free of duty - and, if we ,f exemptees' are to be liable for duty, there should be a general order about it^ so that, in the case of sale, the question cfen be settled with the vendee. 3. I shall be glad to hear your decision in the matter. Incidentally it is perhaps relevant that I sold the car in question at a loss of about £60/- so that I am not asking for a concession in order to get any profit. Yours sincerely, C.D. Belgrave, Esquire, CBE, Adviser to the Bahrain Government, BAHRAIN. fry A Qj&amp;*~D.C. f4/j Adviserate, July 29, 1948. Reference your D.O.No.3r76 dated 27th July, 1948. This natter came up in connection with the sale of cars by members of the Ruling Family who had imported the cars without paying import duty. It then transpered that there were other cars in the same category as well as a considerable amount of material imported without duty by Bapco and subsequently sold locally, this included both new and second hand goods. I told the Traffic Department to try and trace some of these cars but in most cases they have been sold and resold therefore I propose doing nothing about any past transactions but in future the seller will be responsible for obtaining the lOfS of the sale price from the purchaser and refunding it to the customs.

No. 1562-7/1 dated 17th May 1948, I regret that the Customs Rules which were sent to you by Smith, while I was on leave last year, were not seen by me first, they should not have been sent up in their existing form. I have had time during Ramadhan to draft a new Customs Ordinance incorporating the gist of what we already have with some other rules based on the Sudan Customs Ordinance and other Ordinances of which I had copies. In my opinion it wil be more satisfactory for everyone if the new Ordinance can be adopted instead of supplementing the old rules by a King 1 s Regulation. If the Ordinance is approved I propose having copies printed which will be available to the public in English and Arabic. I have not yet had the Ordinance put into Arabic but as soon as I hear from you that it is approved I shall do so. I do not think that in this case it is necessary to obtain His Highness f s approval before publishing the Ordinance as it is based upon Ahlans and Notices which were originally issued under the seal of the late Shaikh and on rules which have been in force for a great many years. \ C.

The only point I have to make about it concerns the offence and penalty laid down et paragraph 14 of 'Offences and Penalties' (pa^e 15). This implies a power to make regulations under the Ordinance. Where is that stated to exist? And by whom is it to be exercised? The only case which h-s struck me as one in which the Director of Customs might possibly make such a regulation Is to specify the documents etc. which would have to be produced 'relating to the despatch of the goods' under paragraph 6 (5) of the Ordinance, though I am not sure that the power is even stated to exist in that para graph. 2. The words 'provided that' should, I think, be inserted before 'a female' in Section 33. Yours sincerely, •D. Belgrave, Esquire, CBE, Adviser to the Bahrein Government BAHRAIN.

Of the alternatives suggested in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Donaldsons letter, I think on the whole I^prefer the second and the Bahrain Government has now sent me a draft 'Customs Ordinance'^which I think we mi.^ht apply in toto by a King f s Regulation to those subject to the Bahrain Order-in-Council. It does admittedly give the Director of Customs fairly severe powers and I think that when informing the Bahrain Government we are applying it we should at the same time state 'it is understood' that the Director of Customs will remain an European appointed with the approval of His Majesty^ Government. I do not think the provision for an appeal to the Political Agent is adequate protection by itself for people subject to our jurisdiction. If Colonel Galloway agrees with this view I shall inform the Bahrain Government ac cordingly. Then after they have published the or dinance, it will be necessary to have a King's Regulation made applying it to the persons subject to the Bahrain Order-in-Council. I shall forward a draft Regulation for allowance. 2. Paragraph 14 of page 16 of the ordinance should be omitted - at my suggestion to the Director of Customs. Yours sincerely, ■■ c. Major A.L.A.

It has been noticed that page 6 of the draft % rules et seq mainly concern shipping and it might be wise to let the Manager of Gray, Mackenzie see the rules before they come into force as that firm will have to observe them.

As for the aircraft I think the 'pro visions relating to travellers' and those about the import and the levy of duties, with the penalties t?? their breach, are sufficient and that no special provisions are necessary.

I enclose a copy of letter No.E 4789/1181/91 of November 29th from the Foreign tffice, and a re-draft of the Bahrain Customs Ordinance of 1960 and a Memorandum of comments by the Legal Advisers in the F.C. (both in original). It will be seen that a few corrections have been made in pencil in the Memorandum. 2. Our comments on the Memorandum are as follows (1) Vie agree that this is a good idea particularly in view of the increasing air traffic. (2) The Bahrain Government should define the word holiday and there should be not too many of them. We suggest this definition M The word holiday means any ciay so prescribed for the purpose of this Ordinance by the Government of Bahrain under the seal of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain.' (S) The Bahrain Government may please be asked to make a decision on this point. We consider paras (4), (6), (6) are all improvements. (7) The Bahrain Government should make it clear how many copies they require. (9) Section 31 should we think remain, as it does not appear tc be covered by Section 6. (10),(11) ie see no reason why the Director of Customs should not be given power to compound offences. It may be noted that the penalty for offence (1) in Article SS is in excess of the maximum which we can impose and it is therefore suggested that it should be reduced to Rs.1600. Any King's Regulations made to enforee the Customs regulations should make any breach of an offence punishable by the Orders-in-Ccuncil for the time being in force. This will overcome any suggestion that penalties are being r tii'i'ud by the Bahrain Government. 'rjweo( (12) We suggest that the word'^uthorised' might be in serted instead of 'employed'. (16) The Bahrain Government should be asked to fix the landing charge if they so desire. (16),(18) The amendments suggested should be incorpor ated in the final draft. (17) We agree that the provision for quantities of less than 100 packages is necessary. 3. If youxsee no objection kindly forward the 're-draft' and the MemorancR ^Ttb the Bahrain Government asking them if they agree to the new insertions and also to answer the queries that have been ■yi o ■? o /'SKindly return the original re-draft and Memorandum with your reply as we have no copy.

(11) TTfie penalties and wording as suggested in the re-draft have been adopted. When I drafted this Ordinance partly from previous orders and Alans I found that no penalties had been laid down for many of the offences. The penalties which I proposed were penalties which A thought would be generally suitable for the offences. (12) I have altered my draft to read as follows 'May be arrested by any Customs Officer, Customs official or Customs guard'. (13) The heading 'Import Duties' has been added and refe rence to baggage, books etc. , has been removed. (1U) These are now in order.
