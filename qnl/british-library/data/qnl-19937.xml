Since Shaikh Salman became ^uler the &lt;j±1 Royalties have continued to be apportioned in the same manner. 2. Those members of the A1 Kha1ifah who have official appointments under the Bahrain Government draw the salaries shown in the annexure to this note. Other sources of revenue to the A1 Khalifah are (i) Civil List Payments and (ii) Allowances given by His Highness the Shaikh from his Privy Purse. 3. Civil List Payments during the last six years have been as follows :« These payments represent monthly allowances to members of the A1 Khalifah and to certain old servants and dependents. As will be seen from the figures given above there is no tendency for payments from the Civil List to increase. _ 4. From his Privy Purse His Highness ihaikh Salman gives allowances aggregating Ks« 11,139/- monthly to various members and dependents of his family. In addition to these monthly allowances His Highness makes special payments twice a year when Oil Royalties are received, on these six-»monthly ocGasions he gives each of his two uncles :s. 20,000/- and to other members Q- . amily a sum equal to their normal monthly allowance. Occasionally His Highness has given members of his family sums of money equal to two months 1 allowance but this is the exception rather than the rule. 5. During recent months there has been a phenomenal rise in the cost of living in ^ahrain^and members of the A1 Khalifah have found difficulty in maintaining themselves and their house- holdi- ^i^ highness has^invariably given financial assistance, when he thought it Justified, from his . rivy i^urse^and has never suggested either to the Adviser or myself that additional payments should be made to the A1 Khalifah from State funds. His Highness is careful in financial matters and deliberately keeps the purse strings tight in order to make the members of his family continually aware of their dependence on him. 1356 1357 1358 1359 1360 1361 i:S 4,45,773 11 6 4,45,792 4 o 4,38,234 10 7 4,34,905 8 0 4,34,782 2 3 4,28,108 0 0 Afc*.A / r ^ ;&gt;/ •&gt; i.

This included a contribution of Es. 9,80,000/- to the Reserve Fund. During the year abnormal expenditure, not anticipated in the Budget, was made amounting to Fs. 10,04,000/-.

In the year 1360 the Electric Department credited to the Bahrain Government a sum of Rs 1,00,000 to be held as a deposit. This item is correctly shown as a deposit with the Bahrain Govern ment in the Electric Department's Balance Sheet for 1360 (vide v psge 42 Bahrain Annual Heport 1360). By an error of accounting the Bahrain Government did not place this sum in a deposit account as they should have done but credited it to Revenue (vide Statement x of Revenue and Expenditure at page 10 of Bahrain Annual Report for 1360). In the year 1361 the Electric Department required a refund of their deposit. If the sum had been correctly accounted for by the Bahrain Government as a dposit in 1360 the sum would have been refunded from the deposit account. But as the sum had, incorrectly been credited to Revenue in 1360 it had to be debited to Expendi ture when it was refunded in 1361. If proper accounting methods had been followed the actual figures of Revenue during 1360 would have been reduced by Rs 1,00,000 and the actual figures of Expendi ture during 1361 would also have been reduced by the same amount. to •y-'l.J- /\f 0 .-]S2'3 cj. 7/9/VJ Political ^gent, Bahrain.(3) I CONFIDmTIAL y ' Political Agency, No.0/1582. 3ahrajin, 23rd November 1943.

I now enclose a copy of a memorandum from the Adviser on the more important differences of the various budget headings for the three years 136^, 1361 and 1362. 4. The year 1362 has very nearly come to an end and although my comments on this year, which form an enclosure to this letter, may be of some value when the budget for 1363 is compiled, I do not consider that any useful purpose can be achieved by my commenting on the budget for the year 1361. 5. I have not yet had sufficient leisure to examine the investments of the Bahrain Government and Bahrain Electrical Department but will do so as soon as I can find time and will furnish you with my views should I notice any points of particular interest. 6. Provided the Hon 1 ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf sees no objection, I propose to forward a copy of my memorandum to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. Political Agent, Bahrain.- 2 - Interest on Reserve. The amount shown in the estimate for 1361 included the interest due on the reserve ard the interest for six npnths (second half oi 13bl) on Rs # 9,80,000/- whieh I had anticipated would be added to the reserve in 1361. It was not possible to invest this amount during 1361 owing to the state having to purchase foodstuffs. In 1362 the interest due 6n the existing reserve was shown in the budget. Other Keceluls and -axes . In 1360 no revenue was expected from 'Medical Receipts'. In 1361 I assumed that this source of revenue would produce x'.5,000/-, twice this amount was obtained. In 1362 I have anticipated an income of {Is. 55,000/- from hospital fees, the greater proportion being on acount of service in-patients who occupy the two service wards in the State hospital. Bridge tolls were not included in the 1360 budget. In 1361 I assumed that Fo.30,000/- would be forthcoming from this source, and a similar sum in 1362. The variations in estimates of the other sources or revenue such as Court fe s. Passport Receipts, Rents etc. are not considerable. A sum of Rs.13,000/- was included in the 1362 Budget under Sales of Lands. Negotiations were proceeding for the sale of a piece of land to the Royal Air. Force and I assumed that this sum would be forthcoming. The total anticipated revenue for the three years was, 1360, Rs.35,64,000; 1361,R s .37,00,000/ t and 1362,R?.36,57,000/- Expenditure . Total estimated exp^ iw iture in the three years, 1360, 1361 and 1362 was Rs.35,64,000, Rs.37,00,000 and Rs.36,57,000 respectively.- 3 - Rullnr Jamllv. Oil Royalty . This payment is dependent upon the amount of oil royalty. His Highness The Shaikh received l/3rd of the royalty payment. Civil List. In 1360 and 1361 certain pensions paid to non members of fche Ruling Family were included in the Civil List. These paynuants were shown separately in 1362. Administration. The cost of Administration in 1360 was about Rs.25,000/- Owing to increasing costs I allowed approximately the same amoimt. less than the allocated amountZfor the following year. Juring the current year I have anticipated additional ex, enditure under this heading of approximately Rs-67,000/- owing to War Allowances, high cost of transport fares, stationery etc. and the maintenance of the Food Department which in a new branch of the Customs Department, Public Health . Estimates of expenditure on Publie Health for 1360 and 1361 differed by Rs. 12,000/-. In 1362 I allowed an additional Rs. 54,000/- to cover the very great rise in the cost of food , drg drugs, medical stores etc, This allocation includes the costs of the two European service wards from which it is expected revenue amounting to about Rs. 50,000/- will be received. Public Protection. The c6st of pu lie protection in 1360 was over estimated by Ps.26,000/-. In 1361 I anticipated tn t expenditure u^der this heading would not exceed R3.4,00,000/-, The actual a'onnt spent was Rs. 4,31,000/-. The extra cost of publie protection was due to higher cost of rations for State forces and prisoners, the war allowance paid to the Natur forces and the enhanced cost of clothing and equipment. The Budget for 1362 includes under this heading Rs. 65,000/- for new equipment and uniforms of which only a portion in likely to be s.ent during the yeat.Education In 1360 Rs.1,32,000/* was provided for Education, the actual expenditure was 8s.1,57,000/-. During this year the Secondary School was increased in size and the hostel for students was enlarged. In 1361 the sum allocated to Education was Rs.2,40,000/- of which Rs.2,24,000/- was spent.. Provision was made in the Budget for Rs.35,000/- wprth of tools and equipment for the Technical School which expanded considerably during the year and also for Rs.18,000/- worth of furniture and equipment for Boys and Girls* Schools to provide accomo dation for the increasing numbers of pupils. Both the Second ary School and Hostel were moved to larger buildings and several village schools were enlarged. For the current year Rs.2,60,000/- has been proveded for Education to cover war allowances, increased costs of school books and materials used in the schools and for Technical training. Public Works. In 1360 Rs.20,000/- was assigned to maintenance of roads and buildings and Rs.3,66,000/- for certain new works including Shaikh Hamad Bridge, hospital buildings and new married lines at the Fort. In the following two yeqrs owing to cost of building and the fact that the Public Works De partment was mainly occupied with work for the Royal Air Force no important public works were contemplated. The remaining items of expenditure in the Budget such as Municipal Grants, Unforeseen, Contribution to Reserve Fund and Poor Relief do not appear requi e any explanation. .&amp; u BAHRAIN BUDGET FOR 1362 I - GMiiRAL The accounts of the Bahrain -nilectrical Department, and the Budget for uhe Bahrain Klectrical Department have been kept separate from the State Budget and the State Accounts- This is, in my opinion, quite wrong and the assets of the iSlectrical Department should be shown as assets of the State and the department should be budgeted for in exactly the same way as any other department of tiie jOvernmenx»» II. BAHHulN ELECTRICAL DSPAHTMSNTT 1. 'Profit and Loss Account' 1361. On the receipt side of the 'Profit and Loss Account' x.here is only one item which reads 'Sundry Revenues and receipts • The receipts should be detailed under their major heads and should there be any small receipts of not sufficient importance to receive a heading of their own, they should be describee! as 'Sundry'. The revenues from rentals, telephones, sale ot appliances, sale of current, and installauion charges, etc., should be clearly shown. On the expenditure side the use of the word 'Reserve in conjunction with 'Bad Debts' and 'Knglne Spares', does not seem to be appropriate. 'Operating Reserve' does not cor rectly describe the purpose for which the money is to be used# If the item Bs.48,761-13-1 is intended to finance the operations of the Electrical Department then it would seem to me that it should have been transferred to the liability side of the 'Balance Sheet' and not appear in this account at alx. If, however, it is in fact the excess of receipts over expenditure, i.e., the profit on 'Lhe year's working, as it would appear to be, then it should be described as such. 2.' Balance Sheet' There is no indication that any interest has accrued from the Es.2, 18,465-7-8 noted in the tr Balance Sheet' for 1361 /asas being in the bank. This may be due to the fact that the money has only just been invested and therefore dividends have not become due. Cn the liability side of the 'Balance Sheet' 1361 we see a free use of the term 'Reserve'. 'Deprec^iation Reserve' could possibly be better described as a 'Replacement Fund' while it should not be necessary to have a 'Reserve for Bad Debts' in your 'Balance Sheet'; although 'Bad Debts' might, and frequently do, figure in accounts. Under 'Operating Reserve' there is the sum of io.1,36,403- -16-3 without any indication of how this sum was arrived at; we have already noted ftn 'Operating Reserve' of is.48,761-13-1 in the 'Profit and Loss Account' 1361. 3. Graphs The graphs showing 'Units Generated' and 'Revenue in I-Upe^V are misleading, for the revenue is shown at half the scale of the units generated. Thus the variation in the 'Revenue' graph is only half as great as the variation in the 'Unit'^raph. The 'Revenue' scale should in future reports be the same as the 'Units Generated' scale. III - STATE BUDGST RSVKNU3S 1. Oil Royalty . The Adviser is correct in giving a conservative estimate under this head. 1 have oeen given to understand that the expansion of the Refinery will not affect the royalty paid to the Bahrain Gtovernment/^» yuaJ. 2. Customs . As the Bahrain Customs duties are assessed on the value of the articles imported and not on the quantity the revenue will only decrease when the value of the uoual imports falls below that of the previous year. I see little likelihood of this occurring in view of iJae continual rise in prices and I consider that this should have been taken into account when assessing the probable revenue under ohis head. I believe that the customs revenue this year has already exceede&lt; the budget figure by some six lakhs of rupees. 3. Suspense Accouht . rhe sum of hs.7,73,000 has been /shown3. shown on the 'Hevenue' side as proceeds of sales of food-stuffs to the general public. The same figure appears on the 'ifixpenditure' side for the purchase of food supplies. Jhus it would seem that the Bahrain Government do not intend to meet the additional expenditure necessitated by the employment of additional staff to supervise the purchase and distribution of food supplies by a slight increase in the sale price of those supplies. In fact they have budgeted for it under 'Customs and Food Control'. This amounts to a subsidy by the Government to the people and for purposes of assessing exactly how much assistance the Government is giving to the people it would be better to have the Food Control expenditure shown as a separate item to the Customs expenditure. 1. Administration . (a) Passport Department . The Passport Department is being run at a loss. This is probably due to the fact that owing to the restrictions on foreign travel the sale and renewal of Bahrain Government passports has greatly decreased. At the same time, the work of x.he Passport Department has increased owing to the additional services now being run by the British Overseas Airways Corporation. ( b ) Transport . Bo.26,00© has been budgeted for 'Transport 11 (Item (g) of paragraph 2 of the Budget). This sum is used to keep up a Government garage which mends and services Bahrain Government transport and municipal transport. The heading 'Transport' is misleading and it should be 'Government Garage' and be budgeted for it under the heading P .W.D. The municipalities should pay for services carried out by the Government garage and this income should be shown in the accounts as revenue^ and if necessary they should have their grants increased to meet this additional expenditure. /2. • &gt;J 2. Public There has been an increase under tnls head and such increase is, in my opinion 9 justified by the additional cost of food-stuffs and the high prices of dru^s* I expect that the rewenue during the present year v .ill greatly exceed that budgeted* S. Public Protection, The fact that the State Police do not receive a War liiowance is not apparent from the budget but they alone of all the Departments of Qoyernment hare had no alteration in their pay since the war began* They are undoubtedly entitled to at least a 2b% increase in their basic pa/ and a budget provision for this ahould be made in the budget for 1362 # 4, Pttbilic WQjfra IK'yfef&amp;jrent# It would Qppear that this Department costs the State ^•49 f 000 and only supervises the expenditure of it#dO f OOO* This is, I am glad to say, not the not onlv case, for the Public works Department/deals v .ith the 'Shaikh and but has Hamad Bridge*, 'Hew Buildings', sued during the course of the last year has supervised, free of cost, a considerable build ing programme for the Defence Services. The Public Works Department should undoubtedly be a m jor heading and should include the 'Upkeep of Bo ads and Qoverniaent Builflings', 'The Shaikh Hamad Bridge' and 'Public ^orks, Sew Buildings'* The Department should appear on the revenue side as well as on the expenditure side* When considering the amount spent under the 'Upkeep of Roads' it mu^t be re^ilised that the roads alluded to are the roads l^ing outside the municipal limits and outside the Oil Company's area* The municipalities are res- ponaiblc for the upkeep of their own roads and grants to the ounlcipallties amounting td **51*000 (item 6 of the Budget) are made by the Government to assist them in carrying out this work* It would be beneficial if the Municipal Budgets besides being published in newspapers were shown in the6« Poor naliof.

Political Agent, Bahrain, Tlie Hon r ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushiree. Sir, I have the honour to enclose copies of;- (a) The Bahrain Government Budget estimates for the year 1363. (b) An explanatory note on the budget by the Adviser to the Bahrain Government# (c) A further note on the budget figures by the Adviser vfhich was compiled at my request. General Conservative officials * nen buclgettr.ng iiave a tonaency to under estimate revenue figures and to over estim« -e expendi ture figures. Provided this tendency is kept within reasonable limits no hwrm is done but when the difference between antici pated exi enditure and revenue and actual expenditure anci revenue is ^reat one of the principal objects of a budget is deieated* In my opinion the Auviser, who is responsible for the preparation of the Bahrain State Budget, has been too cautious in his budget for 1363 and the revenue figures are not a reason^ able forecast of what can be expected from the various sources of revenue from which the State obtains its money* Cr the expenditure side a fslse impression of the amount required to run the State Departments is given by including projects in the budget which it is slmost certain will never be carried out, in some cases owing to the impossibility of obt4 inir:g nateri-- Is and in some cases owing to the difficulty of obtaining si a -led /j ersons —persons to fill Government appointments. 3. Heveriae There «re three items on the revenue side of the budget v.hich merit a ttention. They zre:- (a) Customs Receipts (b) Judiciil -ieceipts (c) School Fees. P Or 7 - (a) The « ctu£.ls for last yet-r (1362^ under the\ head ^Cuspoms' amounted to Hs»13,96,500 • 'nicL the A.visor only budgeted oo receive r .6,10,000. Durinj the prosent financial year the Adviser has bucketed to receive Bs.8,60,000, apparently anticipat ing a iecrease on last year's actuals of Rs • 5,36,50C . -is 'Cue import uuty u levied on the value of the goods imported and not on the quantity and as no reasonable person can expect any substantial decrease in prices during the coming t.elve months, in fact everything indicates a further rise in prices, and as at the same time the quantity of imports has already decreased to v/hat must be considered as phe barest minimum it is reasonable to suppose tlv t last year's actuals will be maintained. Therefore to budget for £ 38% fall in revenue is unnecessarily cautious. (b) The budget caters for a reduction in the judicial revenue amounting to Rs.34,5Q0 and the Adviser has stat-d in his explanatory note that this reduction will be due to a decrease in fines because he assumes that there will be a decrease in smuggling activities and food control offences. I regret I cannot find myself in agreement v.ith the Adviser on this point for in my opinion the greater the scarcity of material and the higher the prices in surrounding countries where price control has not been as succoaaful as in Bahrain the more probable it is that smuggling will increase. Human nature being what it is and prices being what they are I do not for one moment believe that offences against food control regu lations will be any less in 1363 than they were in 1362. At the same time it is reasonable to assume that the efficiency of the police in bringing smugglers and profiteers to trial will not /deterioratedeueriorata during the coming yaar and that the judges will thus have the opportunity to maintain their high standard of fines. (c) School fees, item 6 (b) of the budget, are shown as being only ? .4,300 during the year while the expenditure on education is ^ .2,64,000. These school fees are the only contribution to /ards non-technical education :&gt;aid by the peoi^le of Bahrain. 4. Expenditure There is of course a genercl rise in expenditure which the Adviser has in my opinion rightly ascribed to increases in wfr allowances and other causes brought about by the unsettled state of the world in general. I find little to criticise outside the State Engineer's Department but I think it right to draw attention to the amount which the Bahrain Government is paying for the Special Police. The role of the Special Police has been described in the Adviser's note which forms an enclosure to this letter but he h: 1 s in no way stressed the fact that they should be considered at least in part as a contribution towards the cost of the v,ar by the government of Bahrain. It is true that they ar-e en ployed in safeguarding the principal source of the State*s revenue. It is equally true that oil is of vital importance and that if His Highness had taken the line that he was in no way responsible for the war and that the liability for the guarding of the Hefinery and Oil Field should therefore devolve on His Majesty 1 s Government we should have been faced with the un feasant duty of either forcing the Shaikh to meet3^ this expenditure or Meeting it ourselves. I think it fair to cons/ider at least half of this . expenditure as a contribution from the Bahrain Government to His lajesty's Government for the prosecution of the war. 5. State Kn^ineer's Department . (a) I still do not understand why the Shaikh Kanad Bridge /which-. r-hich appears to me to be a public work and is in fact the principal public work in the Islands should be administered by the State ^igineer and not by the ?,7.D. and 1 have been unable to obtain a satisfactory explanation of this phenomenon. It would be surprising if it were in any other department to see that no depreciation has been charged on the structure for the past t-vo years. (b) I have boon unable to obtain r satisfactory explarr tion from the Adviser why the Telephmes Service, and the Air Conditionerf l^'' ■ Service are consistently run at a loss. To budget for a loss when it is unnecessary is bad finance especially when the deficit can be expunged perfectly simply by increasing the charges to balance the exjenditure. As it is at the moment &gt;eo )le who are BHj not sufficiently fortunate to ov.n a telephone or an air conditioning I unit subscribe to provide 'their more fortunate bret] reft 1th tele- W® phones and the employees of the Bahrain Government, with air conditioners. . 6. In conclusion I think a reasonable comment on the budget for 1363 is that the Adviser, although too conservative in outlook, a has prepared/satisfactory budget . hich is expected not only to cover expenditure but to produce what for the fifth year of the war must be considerec. as a very satisfactory surplus. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant Political A :ent, Bahrain.^ I No . 1$ S - Lhr&amp; of 1363 Office of the Adviser to the Governmont, Bahrain Dated, Moharram 24, 1363 January 20, 1944. Frcra . ^ ^ C. Dalrymple Belgravo, Esquire, C.i3»E. , Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. To His Britannic Majesty^ Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to enclose, for your infonustion, copies of the Budget of the State for the year 1363, together with a Summary of receipts and expenditure for 1362 and a note explaining the various items in the Budget. In order to facilitate a comparison of actuals and estimates I have shown the revenue and expenditure figures for 1362 on the same sheet as the estimates for 1363. A Summary of the Budget of the 31ectricity Supply Department has been included below the otate Budget. I have the honour to be.?' 1 BUDGET 1363. sxpmvrvm . The estimate for eipenditure for the budget year exceeds 35 lacs aad in higher than any other year in the history of the ^tate. It exceeds tiie actual expenditure in the previous year by 2 lacs. Out of the 35 lacs the allowances to the Ruling Family absorb 13 lacs which is more than one third of the whole estimated expenditure. The Budget Surplus is estimated at Ks.4,70,000/-, but as the revenue has been based on very conservatice lines and more than sufficient has been provided for most of the items of expenditure it may reasonably be hoped that the Surplus will be more than the sum which is shown in the budget. Almost the whole ,f the expenditure consists of salaries which for the most part are paid to Bahrain subjects living in the country. In past years the expen diture included the provision of large sums for purchases from abroad such as building materials, motor vehicles and for the construction of Shaikh Haiaad Bridge. This money went out of the country but the expenditure in the 1365 budget is almost entirely local. '^he expenditure on State Departments is estimated at i 'i4 .4,50,000/- which is 4 lac more than the actuals of the previous yoar. Customs expenditure in 1362 was abnormally high as it included certain payments on account of leave etc., made to the retiring Director of Customs. xiiG cos L ol the Food Control Department has bee:i shown this year as a separate item, it lias expanded considerabl^y since last year owing to the building ani opening of new Government shops. In several Departments provision has been made for a full complement of staff which does not at present exist and it is doubtful if the vacancies will be filled during tne Budget year. The Increased rate of war allowances, which was introduced in the latter part 2/of 1S68, higher wages and the normal annual increments hava aU contributed to the greater cost of administration. The provision of 'Sduce.tion exceed? iast year's expen diture by over ono lac. la all schsola, except the Tech nical School, the number of taachars has incraased and one large new school was opened. War Allowa ices at the present rate were net paid throughout the '/ear 126S but have boon provided for during the whole ef 1563. A sum of a ..28.00C/- is allocated for higher education and expansion, this incluaes fees far boys who may be seiit to study abroaa during the next school term, provisien for two new ICindor- gartan schools and some additional more qualified teachers for the existing schools. 0«t of the Hi.6;j,000/-, wnieh is provided for the Technical school iu.8,000/- is the cost of material which is expected to be recovered by the sale of work o The increased expenditure on Pufclic Health is to a certain extent offset by the anticipated revmuo of ju.65,000/- which is expected to be received in fe-s. The higher cost la due to the high prices of stores and equipment, war allowances, increments and the cost of food. Defence and Protection now coats the iitate almost 6. lacs. It has riaan steadily since the beginning Ox the war and Is likely to increase. Tls to* in the budget al. ows for the scales of pay existlxig at the end of the year 1362 and no provision has been made for any further increases wnich may become necessary during 1363. Only m.20,000/- has bean provided for uniforms and equlpmaxt as in 1362 a quantity of new material was purchased by the State. The Special Police, who are paid for entirely by the Jtate are employed solely on protective duties at the Refinery and oil fields. This expensive responsibility was uu •- taken by the State waon the military authorities decMed that it was necessary to employ a Special Police Force to prevent sabotage etc. Towards the end of 156a theif - 3 - Police were givon a war allowsince. Barller in the year they wore granted a concession by which instead of paying for certain i teres ©f their uniform froia their uniform allo '^aace all uniform was issued and replaced freely and the men wore allowed to retain their clothing allowance for themselves. The Spocial Folic o were also provided with tickets entitling them to free transport once weekly between Manama and their cajnp. The ccst to the State of the pay aid rations of a policeoar is now Rj ,51/- per month which does not include clothing, housing etc. The Police receive rations on a generous scale, including rice, and the quantity of cereals per head per month is more then than double the quantity of the cereals which is issued to the public. I^ost of the other items of expenditure in the budget are self explanatory. Out of the sum which is provided for Poor Relief the Grovemmeat distributes a small quantity of ^ates to Piajty hundreds of poor people daily in Manama and Moharraq and also loaves of bread to the binder nor i shed children in the country schools. The new works which are mentioned under Public Works include a new Womens Dispensary in Moharraq, in place of the present hired house and some additions to the Fort and the Schools. Under State Bngineer^ Department the expenditure shown against Shaikh Hamad Bridge is [*.41,000/-• The actual expenditure is estimated at ite .17,000/-, annual depreciation is K»,8,000/~ per annum. In 1361 and 1362 no sum was set aside for depreciation. A new account has now been opened into which the annual depreciation on the bridge will be paid and the depreciation _for 1361 and 1362 has been included on the expenditure side of the 1363 budget. In 1362 the State sustained a loss of K#. 56,500/- over the sale of food supplies to the public. This was caused by the state selling certain coxmnodities at less v—than oost price and also by being obliged at times to sell foodstuffs before the costs were ascertained. The sum of i-j. 60,000/- has bean provided to cover similar eventualities in 1563. In the past Departmental expenses each as stationery, furniture etc, for ali. Goveraaant Departaants were shorn in a separate budget heading. In the new budget the »e expenses have been divided among the Departiuents concerned. In the Budget for 156^ the amount spent by the Govern ment on the food sup lies which it held at the end of the year was «howu as a Guspense Account. This year a new account, has been opened for Food Supplies on a corns.ercial basis a.Qd tne amount vrliich had been spent by the Gove mm ait at the end of 1562 is shown as an advancedto that account against purchase of foodstuffs. The sum outstanding at the end of ISO*, was approximately 14 lacs, normally this sum would have been added to tno Reserve Fund and would have produced an income of IU«42 9 000/-. In addition the State has provided fory (possible loss of 15 .60,000/- by the sile of rooastuffs apart from the cost of administering &amp; Food Control.— I— — IIH1Cc).

They would, ho.evex, invite attention to the fact that the allowances of the Ruling family absorb a proportion of tiie totrl revenues of the State which is higher than is generally considered appropriate. I' is recalled the' iu your letter No. /2&amp;2 of the 11th July 1B41 you strted ' f hat you had sown the seeds for en eventual reduction of the Ruler 1 s share of the oil royalties from one-third to one- .* 9/ fifth, but that since the State h&amp;c ell the funds it required the matter w«s not then being pressed. .Al though it is recognised that with the increased costs -of living now prevailing the present, time also may not be regarded as particularly auspicious for urging a reduction in His Highness* Privy Purse, yet he necessity for economy in all directions is likely to increasingly felt, and the Government of India trust that-you will lose no op:x)rtunit&gt; of impressing upon Highness the desirability and importance of reducing personal expenditure and the sc^le of allowances of his family as soon as this becomes possible. be His his It may be of interest to you to .caiow that, in an IndipwJt?»te diith an annual reverue, Rs. 40 lakhs, current political theoiy ^nd practice would regard any tiling between 10 and 15% as a fitting end no f un reasonable proportion of the Lotal revenue to be allotted to ^he privy purse5 though, if the ruler of such a State asked for advice, it wculd be suggested K -CO!TFIl )i ::iTlAL British Residoncy &amp; Consulate-General Bushire, the 6th February| 1945• Krom The Hon'ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., Political Resident| Persian Gulf f B tJ 3 H I R K. To The viecretary to the Oovornnent of India in the External Affairs Department, f{ ^ '.y p E hw l. Sir, I have the honour to refer to External Affairs Department Letter l^o, D. 18261- 2^/44 of the 21st December, r.H4, regarding the Bahrain Report, 1362, 2. I regret to say that I have not yet found time to road this Report, but the facts are \7ell knovm to and there is no difficulty in answering the question raised. In the first place I consider the present raofoent most inopportune for suggesting any reduction in the Privy Purse, as it would alnost inevitably lead to a request for more money, which His Highness has not so far made, and which might be difficult to refuse. It must be reraerabered that the Ruling Family in Btfirain now receive almost exactly the same amounts they drew in 1341, although the cost of living has trebled, and, since their financial position has obviously greatly deteriorated they would consider it most inequitable to be asked at this stage to exist on smaller stipends, 3, I would also deprecate analociss being drawn from Indian States and applied to the Persian Qulf, where they have little real relevance. Colonel Barrett, who was a very experienced Political Officer with Arabs, stated in 1987 or 1928 when the late cihaikh Hamad was making one of his periodical demands for money, that the A1 Khalifah considered that the revenues of the ^tate belonged to them, and that any portion they surrendered for the use of the administration must be regarded as an act of f' v race« This position still exists in Kuwait, with which the Bahrain Family could appro priately compare themselves, and also in Saudi Arabia to whom, and not to an Indian iitate, their eyes would naturally turn. It is Impossible to move very far in advance of public opinion in these states, and so far as I know the handsome allowances paid to the Al Khalifah are regarded rather as a tribute to our administrative ability than an oppression which should bo alleviated I In fact, if I were to attempt to reduce the allowances now, there Is not the slightest doubt that I should be accused of starving the Uillngfamily, and that widespread Indignation would be aroused* A ' ., F1 ' la l ;L y» tha proportion quoted In the above aentloned letter requires sorae exaalnatlon. Any of: laer on the Internal aide and especially one who has been on foreign service In a State, Is'well a-.»are that a paper Privy Parse of 10 or 16 per cent of the Revenue Is a very different figure in actual practice in leas the i-inance Officer and the Accountant General are both servants of the Government of India. Then, In an Indian 3tate the main source of incoue Is land revenuej which is levied at an exceptionally high rate, and it .3 only reasonable that the haling Family should content the use Ives with 10 or 15 per cent of it. f? ' h^ver, the positlen is entirely different. *..^ere ^s no xanu revenue or zakat, and the main source ot revenue contributed by the public is a very llrht ? Uty : As 1 l3 ' Ml I known, their wealth arises ..rofii viielr mineral possessions, and in ensuring that only one^ liilrd ol this Tails into the hands of th© Ruling ramily, I feel that c very great deal has already been achieved.

The oil con cession provides for a revision of the royalty payment but the time for this revision is still compatatively distant* 2* Customs Receipts, Rs* 15, 60, 000/-. Customs Receipts produced Rs. 20,40,000/- in 1363. In the budget for that year they were underestimated. A difference of Rs. 4,80,00^- has been allowed between the 1363 actuals and the 1364 Budget expectation. The 1363 actuals included certain payments on account of imports during 1362 and in view of the lowering of prices of piece goods in India it is likely that duties on these goods will decrease. 3« Interest on Reserve Rs. 3,20,000/-. This represents the income from the State Reserve Fund which is invested in Government of India Stock and British Saving Bonds. 4. Medical Receipts Rs.45,000/-. The actuals for 1363 were Rs.56,000/- most of this came from Service patients fees. The establishment of other service medical facilities in Bahrain is like-j-y to reduce the number of patients. 5. Land Revenue Rs. 31,000/-. In' estimating the land revenue at less than in 1363 consideration has been given to the abnormal prices obtaining during 1363 and the improbability of t ^e land boom lasting. 6. Education Receipts Rs. 19,000/-. A decrease of Rs. 1,500 has been allowed under this heading, fewer foreign students are attending the schools. 4 7* Vehicle Taxes, etc. Ks. 25,000/-. It appears unlikely that the demand lor motor drivers will assume the lar^e proportion that it has reached in recent years and no new cars are being imported by the public, it therefore seems probable that revenue from this source will decrease.Receipts Rs* A large number of new Bahrain paesports were issued during the second half of 1363 ihich raised the income from thic source ahove ttie normal amount# Judicial Receipts Rs.20,000/-. Important civil cases are more and more infrequent, possibly owing to the prosperity in the country and fewer fines were collected in 1363 than in 1562. Juotcial Receipts are estimated at Rs* 15,000/- less than was collected in 1363* 10. Bridge Tolls* Rs* 20,000/-. The possibility of a revision in the scale of charges for military vehicles has been taken into account in estimating this revenue at Bs. 26,000/- less than the actuals of 1363. Uiseellaneous . Under the heading in 1363 was included the price obtained by sale of some cattle belonging to the Government sale of some surplus Police rations to the JPood control Department and a sum of fis.56,000/- refunded to the Bahrain Government from the Jood Control Department against a loss amounting to this sum which was sustained in 1362. Expenditure . 1. Allowances to the Ruling Family - Rs. 13,20,000/-. This expenditure comprises one th i .rd of the estimated oil royalty and the Civil List, which is a fixed mmount. Pensions are own separately as the persons who receive payments under 'Pensions' are not members of the Ruling Family. 2. State Departments Rs. 3,03,000/-. In the estimates for Customs and Land Departments provision has been made for some additional staff. 3* Judicial Rs. 96 ,000/-. Provision has been made for two additional Kadis to fill vacancies in the Shera Courts. JSducat ion 4,19,000/-. There is an increase of approximately one lakh in the cost of Ecucation. In the boyfe 1 schools provision has been maae f or the pay of the new Egyptian teachers for twelve months as well as for higher rates in pay to many of the local teachers. The second primary school which started in Manama last year was not open during the whole year, the cost ol this is now included in the Budget. In the girls* schools some new Syrian teachers have been employed and a new school started in Manama. The cost of books and materials has increased considerably and a second religious school, under the direction of the Sunni Kadis has been opened.Public Health Rs. 4,72 # 000/«. Provision has been made for a numiber of nurses whom it is hoped may be obtained fiuring the* year. At present the hospital is understaffed# The price of all drugs and appliances are higher than before and the cost of feeding patients has risen considerably* 6. Defence and Protection. Rs. 8,00,000/-. The heavy Increase in the expenditure on the Police and Naturs is due to the high rise in their pay which came into force at the beginning of the year. A certain proportion of this expenditure including tne Special Police, the provisionfor British Police and part of the Natur force can be regarded as war time measures- 7» Public Works. Rs. 1,95,000/-. Provision has been made for a full Public Works Department staff though at the end of 1363 only a skeleton staff existed. The grant for upkeep of roads and buildings has been increased. 8. Municipalities. Rs. 87,000/-. The contribution by the Government to each Municipality has been increased by Rs. 12,000/- per snnum. 11. Agriculture. It is proposed to extend the Government garden at Budeys during the coming year and funds have been allowed to cover the cost of fencing and labour. The other expenditure headings do not seem to require any particular comment or explanation.* lljlfk 1 ^ fc ' (g&gt; 't&gt;- CO^IFIDE?;TIAL . POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, No. C/ 275.

Sir, 1 have the honour to enclose herewith four copies of the State Budget for 1565 which has now boen approved by Ris Highness • Owing to my absence in iSn^land the budget was late in being prepared. navgroa. The actual revenue last year was 64 laichs; in the budget for 1365 I have anticipated a revenue of Kb. 55,45,000. Last year the oil royalty axaounted to 30: lakhs and customs revenue aiaounted to 24« laichs. In the now budget I have assurted that the output of oil be tho sams as in 1364 and that the customs will produce 20 laiths. The leaser oources of revenue appear to require little explanation. The interest from the Reserve Fund is shown at about half what it should normally produce, the reason is that only one half-year^ dividend will be received during 1365, tho dividend for the second half of 1946 is not due until a few days after the end of the Arabic year 1365. 2/ V ju ^ joLaw P'l. rsTo. hll^ cq JL -J JUI a. . j- 2 - M«&lt;UoaI reoaipta am iaas owlnf? to the closing of the sorvloo warda in the Coveromont Hospital 9 the large ward is now usod for 'Suropean civilian patients. Court fecjs and fines arc decreasing because there is less smugK-ling and fewer cases under the price control regulations, this is due to more plentiful supplies of^Toods entering Bahrain and the neighbouring States* Bridge tolls are expected to fall with the reduction in the nufiiber of military vehicles. m^NDITUrtlS . The surplus of revenue over expenditure ia estiioated at 10 lafchs. Apart from the Electric schecie, which is shown separately, almost the whole of this expenditure is recurrent expenditure upon the Civil List, Administ ration and Public Services. A sum of £ and l/3rd lakhs has been allowed for new public works and two lakhs has beon allocated to new transport. The Civil List remains stationary, as it has for many years, the proportion of the oil royalty which is paid to the Ruler is 10 lakhs, a considerable portion of this sum ia expended by His Highness in paying cost of living allowances and additional allowances to the numerous Khalifah relations who depend entirely upon him for support. The expenditure on State D«partmonts is higher than last year as the allotment Cor the customs includes provision for the purchase of new tarpaulins for coverine cargo on the pier. Judicial Departments show a small increase due to the appointment of a third Shia Kadi and additional staff. 3/—iSduoation ha if risea from 4i lalchs to lakhs* The suia of 1 lakh hau boon al t.ooatod tor ti^o ooat of the Bahrain boys who are atud/ing In Cairo and proyision ha» been icade for some expansion in the existing sohools* Sixpenditure on public health has increased from 4^ lakhs to 5 lakhs. public Protection now costs the State almost 8 lakhs of which half a lakh is tne estimated cost of the new British Police, The Special Police were disbanded but a number of them were enlisted in the State Police which is now over strength. During the year a certain pro portion of tne Police will come to the end of the period for which they enlisted and it was therefore desirable to take on men from the Special Police some of whom will take the place of retiring State Police. No provision has been made for tne Manama town water supply scheme. The tender for this work has not yet been received and it is improbable that payment would be made during 1365 though it is hoped that the work will commence during the second half of the year. Tne Government ia endeavouring to obtain a quantity of building materials and P.W.D. requirements from England, in some cases the dates of delivery end the prices are not known but I lakh out of the 2 and l/3rd lakhs allocated under P.W.D. new works and stores are intended to cover the payment for the ®oods which arrive during the current year. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, fyy /rfA f Adviser to the Government. iSncl • • •.^ (71) /^/^f ^ 7 4 . * BOTE ON DISCUSSION WIT1I MR. BfiLSRAVJB AT BAHRAIB OH 16TH MARCH 1946. I began by pointing out that the aotuals for 1362, 1363 and 1364 bore little connection with the facts and showed that the budget was almost worthless as an accurate guide to the financial events in the State* -as The surplus/o^ing to under expenditure and under-estimated revenue were over 7 lakhs in 1362» over 19 lakhs in 1363 and although the actuals of expenditure were not given for 1364 it is clear that there must have been a saving of over 13 3akhs owing to the greatly enhanced revenue received. Mr. Belgrave said that this was due to the excess receipts of cuBtoms revalue and stated that it was diff icult to estimate this accurately in advance. I inquired why he had estimated for a drop in 1364 when it was quite obvious that the war would be going on for some time and that there was little chance of a drop in prices. I could not follow Mr. Belgrave's reply to this. I pointed out that the original plan of saving 14 - 16 lakhs a year was now obsolete as the life of the oilfield was obviously secure for some time to come since the Oil Company were spending a great deal of money in installing fresh plant. I added that so far as I was awaret the life of the field was estimated at between, at the minimum, another 15 years, and possibly as much as 50 years. Mr. Belgrave did not appear to be aware of this. I drew his attention to the fact that the remark in his report two years ago that people were dying of starvation in villages read oddly when one reflected that the State had at that time over half a million pounds in the bank. Mr. Belgrave said that this was really due to the fact that these people were ujcet by the change of diet necessitated by the cessation of rice supplies. I drew his attention to the fact that the word he had used was 'starvation'. Mr. Bel^rave volunteered the statement / thatjf^r~ vS : K- , -• 2 • that when the capital sunk in food supplies was realised the aotual balance of the State would be orer a million pounds. I said that this gave point to my riew that some capital expenditure in the State was justified and added that I felt certain he would have to face rising opposition from the public if nothing wae done in the very gear future• 2. H&amp; A j UTH . I drew Mr# Belgrade's attention to the remark in his report that the staff had been leaving for India owing to inadequate pay* Mr. Belgrave agreed that the State could well afford to payZgood wages as the Government of India# and said that the position was now quite satis factory as the staff were contented with their present terms. I inquirecl the State Medical Officer^ financial powers, and Mr. Belgrave said that he was allowed to spend any amounts in his budget. Mr. Belgrave mentioned that there was a 9-bed hospital for women in Muharraq with a Xady Doctor which was always full, and added that there was a men's out-patient hospital there as well. ^e agreed that J)r. Snow should be asked for his views as to future medical policy in the ^tate. 3. gUGIMBRRING . I inquired the State Engineer's financial powers and degree/jf control over the other engineers and the Oil Gauger. The Adviser said that the State Engineer could spend any sura in his budget, but I was not very clear regarding the degree of his control over the other engineers and the proposed Oil Gauger. Mr. Belgrave seemed to take the view that the Oil Ganger 's appointment would be completely separate, but I pointed out that it was essentially an engineering Job and that in the past the State had had to use the State Sngineer for this duty, and that they would almost certainly have to do so again. / II gave It as my Tien that what the State required was an able and higfrly qualified engineer who would control all the engineering works in the State as Chief Engineer. I remarked on the difficulty that was always experienced in combiitiing electrical and mechanical work with building and roadB 9 but said that a single engineering department was obviously desirable* I was not rery clear what the qualifications of the new engineer were but understood Mr. Beigrave to say that his work wuld be more on the lines of roads and buildings. I drew attention to the fact that he had been engaged without reference to us, a point rtiich is being dealt with later on in this note* I suggested that some standardisation of the electrical plant might be possible so that spares would be inter changeable, and ^r* Belgrave described the existing plant and said that the point would be borne in mind in the future* I mentioned that the condition of the roads was disgraceful and that so wealthy a State could and should improve them* Mr* Seigrave agreed with this and said that he hoped s one thing would now be done* He men tioned that new motor vehicles had been ordered and said that they were awaiting the arrival of the consulting engineers to conclude the water supply agreement* I drew his attention to the agreement with their supply agents in l£nglsnd, which X observed had been concluded without reference to us, and drew attention to the serious defects in it. 4. JSPUC jCTlOH * I pointed out the advantages of getting a man from the British Council to run education in Bahrain and said I would make a final attempt to get one from them. If this failed then the Bahrain Government would have to make their own arrangements. In any case there was little / objectobject in anyone coming out now as the school term had not much longer to run. The diaadrantage of a large number of boys being educated in Egypt was discussed and this point is still under consideration* 1 said that it was essential that the technical school must be run by B a KX ) and urged that an early opportunity be taken to include this obligation in the ConcesBion* Colonel Galloway said that this matter was before the Directors of the Company and it was agreed that they should be pressed to undertake this function* 5. CUSTOMS . I inquired the financial powers of the iDirector and Mr* Belgrave explained that he was empowered to spend any sums included in his budget. I inquired whether there was any plan of reorganisation of the pier or the possibility of haring a bonded warehouse* Mr. Belgrave replied that there was a proposal to fill in the dock between the existing pier and the Kanoo Building but said that the question of having bonded warehouse)had not been considered. X drew attention to the fact that Has Tanura was now being put on the slow mail run and said that I ♦ feared this would divert a good deal of trade from Bahrain which could probably be retained if a bonded warehouse system was introduced as merchants would then be able to make this a centre for the whole Oulf and have a much wider scope open to them. Mr. Belgrave inquired whether they would not be wiser to take the money while they could get it. I pointed out that the State did not require the money and that the time to prevent Rae Tanura developing was now as once trade links were forged they were very persistent* It was agreed that the position would be investigated. 6. JUDIOIaL . I inquired from Mr. Belgrave *h?.t progress he was making in codifying the regulations and publiiiiing thereofy a task I suggested should be undertaken 15 years / agomm**. mm ■ ago when 1 was Political Agents Bahrain. He replied that the work vas proceeding hut that its conclusion nas problem atic* Ke is considering the appointment of Shaikh Salman bin Hamad bin Isa to double for him, a duty which will give him an opportunity to discover how much legal knowledge this young Shaikh has acquired in Palestine. Mr. Belgrave confirmed that there was no compilation of State laws and rules in existence, and that the Sudan Penal Code, though relied on, ha^ not been formally introduced. Apparently His Highness did not care about having the courts bound by set rules for punishments. The Sudan Civil Code is not apparently in force. 7. PQUCa . I began by sayihg that the police in Bahrain were costly and inefficient aMi drew attention to some highly discreditable instances that had occurred recently namely the theft of ammunition from Jidda' Island where it transpired that nearly half a million rounds had not been properly handed over and were in charge of a Lance-Naik. NLr. Belgrave could give no adequate explanation of this, or indeed of the fact that an important prisoner in this case had been allowed to escape by the police and I stated frankly that I thought the whole matter was highly discreditable and reflected seriously upon him. I inquired the functions of the new British Police officers. These are apparently making themselves useful and it is intended that they should prosecute cases in court in #iich Europeans and Americans are concerned. They are mounted on motor bicycles. Mr. Belgrave said that they were popular with His Highness, which is very fortunate. I inquired the suitability of having an Zraqi officer in the Police and Mr. Belgrave replied that he was an excellent mm and most useful. I expressed surprise that in 15 years it had not been found possible to train up a team of highly reliable local men. /1- 6 - I inquired Mr. Belgraye's plaoiB for the future and under stood that he is reviewing the whole matter of the police force and will let us have his conclusions shortly. 8. I obaerred that Mr. Belgrare wan approaching the end of his term in Bahrain, and that it was essential that there should toe someone who should 'be fully equipped to tafce over from him. I inquired whether he m * did not consider there was a case for reverting to the oM position whereby there were three executive off ioers in the State and having an Assistant Adviser now. Mr. Belgrave con sidered that there was a good case for such an appointment. I inquired afcout the auditing of the State accounts. This is still conducted by a firm domiciled in Basra tfio have enough work in the Island to keep their personnel here for some five months in the year. They are able to aud it accounts in Arabic and Mr. Belgrave expressed himself thoroughly satisfied.with their efforts. I asked Mr. Belgrave to be good enough to arrange for his budgeting in future to have a closer connection with realities^ and understood that he hoped to do this. 9. TQWH P^AMKIKO. Apparently little has been done in the way of town planning beyond a proposal to turn the present Import yard into a basaar when the c\Btons sheds are moved out to the dock that is to be filled in. I drew attention to the extremely unsi^itly and oompletely unorganised rabbit warren of a bazaar and stated that what was wanted was a defimite plan for the centre of the town by which proper roads would be introduced so that decent shops could be erected. Mr. Belgrave said that the land was in various ownerships but I replied that there was no reason why a plan should not be worked out and the various obstacles overcome. Mr. Belgrave undertooft to consider this. 10. j^QQURAGifliigflT OP INDUSTRY . I said that, to my regret 9 1 had been unable toto find any industry that could feotirely encouraged In Bahrain with the possible exception of a briguetting plant 1*1 ich apparently inyolved difficulties. It apx^ars that the coke ±* has a high sulphur content which maices it unsuitable for blacksmithing, but if the coke oould be briquet ted and exported to Persia it would be a rery valuable counter in producing supplies in return, so the matter is not sdinply one for the Oil Company but one in #iich Bahrain generally has a Tital stalce. The great drawback in locating any industries in Bahrain is the high cost of labour as compared with India* and the fact that they would not be sheltered brfiind a higji itariff wall as in Persia. ll, I inquired ^ihat progress bad been made in agri culture and Mr# Belgrave said that it was proposed to sngage an jfigyptian who was shortly leaving the baudi Arabl^- ; V -1 service* I pointed out the drawbacks of engaging men in this haphazarfl way sjnd said it would oe much better for Mr# Belgrave, if he wanted Egyptian agriculturists, to fly to Cairo and go into the matter there ^iere a much larger selection would be available for him. IS* I drew Mr* ^elgrave's attention to recent instances of the engagement of European personnel without reference to us and reminded him that he had been warned about this on earlier occasions* He replied that the case had been discussed with the India Office and that he imagined that this had been sufficient* I said that the matter would be taken up with the India Office who would be asked to see in future that such action was not taken without reference to us and reminded him again of the position for his guidance in the future* 13* THJ5 BR ID OS * I inquired whether the swing bridge had paid for its cost or not* *r* ^elgrave replied that it had not yet paid for its initial oost but that this position would shortly be reached* The intention then was to / maJte &gt; - iA 19/176 a 19/169 lo•398-3# Confidential ^ Persian Gulf Re8idenoy 9 Buahire, 5th April 9 1946. From The Hon 9 ble Sir Geoffrey Prior# political Resident, Persian Gulf, To The Secretary to the Govemmsnt of India in the External Affairs Department, Hew Delhi. SM' (4/it*} Sir 9 I have the honour to refer to GoTemment of India letter Ho•D.9680.H^/4&amp; dated the 2nd August 1945 regard, ing the Bahrain State budget 1564» 2. I regret that it has not been found possible to make muoh progress with the recomiuendati ons of the GoTemment of India* In the first place the aboye mentioned letter was received in my absence and Mr. Belgrave proceed ed on leave almost immediately afterwards, and it was not possible to take up the matter with him until my recent visit to Bahrain* There had of course been an abundance of correspondence between myself and the Political Agent, but in the absatice of the financial Adviser to the State it was difficult to come to any tangible conclusions. 3. In the first place I fsel that I should comment on the statement in paragraph 4 that l£r. Belgrave N had done so much in recent years to put the finances of the State on a sound footing* 1 . The fact is that Mr .Belgrave is at present the main obstacle to any administrative improvement in Bahrain* It is not merely the question of the budget, though that could be criticised from almost every angle, but the general administration of the State which requires overhauling from top to bottom. During the war this Residency was kept so short of officers that it wasinpossible to attendto matters that were not urgent and until recently the Bahrain State were unable to obtain personnel or plant according to their requirements. Consequently it was impossible either to make plans for the future or to oblige the Adviser to conform to a higher standard of efficiency. I have, in fact, begun to doubt whether it will be possible tonake much improvement during Mr. Belgrave^ tenure of this post. 4 9 As regards the points mentioned in paragraph 6, Mr. Belgrave has not apparently felt able to give effect to the suggestions. I must confess that I myself am doubtful of their value in so small a budget, and they will have the drawback that it would render comparison with past budgets more difficult, further, it must be remembered that Mr* Belgrave is obliged to submit his budgets to His Highness Shaikh Salman whose grasp of financial matters is somewhat limited* In this connection it is relevant to / mention..... —mention that His Highness* father was quite unable to oomprehend a budget expressed in figures 9 and it was necessary to redraft them for him in the form of a letter, finally it appears to me that the proposals in this paragraph depend upon the estinated life of the oil fields* So far as 1 am aware no accurate estimate is arailablev and such infoxmationa s I have gleaned places it between 15 and 50 years* It will be seent therefore, that the matter is not so simple as it appears 5« I thought it would be useful to go over the administration of Bahrain with Mr* Belgraye and draw his attention to the defects both in this and in the budget* I did this on wy last risit, after carefully studying the ground with the Political Agent 9 and enclose a copy • of the note I recorded after these discussions* It will be seen that the whole admin is t rat ire machinery of the State requires consideration 9 and in some cases 9 recon struction 9 . and that it must be admitted that we have not yet succeeded in maintaining the requirements of the Goyemment of India. I can only say that the matter is being pursued to the best of our ability 9 and amongst many other preoccupations, and that where it is found possible to give effect to the reoomiriendations of the Government of India this will be done* X have the honour to be 9 Sir, Tour most obedient servant 9 GECF Y PRIOR Political Hesident 9 Persian Gulf*n. D.O. Ho.C/576. Dated the 4th of June, 1946, Dear Colonel Hay, Will you please refer/to the correspontfence ending with your printed Letter No«417-S dated the 6th of April f 1946, on the subject of the Bahrain finances? 2# Criticisms on Belgrave's work as Finance Officer have already/Wen made this year - vide my demi-official letter No•0/259 dated the €th March, 1946 f to Sir Geoffrey prior and the enclosures to Residency printed Latter No.410 -3 dated tae 5th April, 1946 - and progress in the various natters is being reported separately* severe criticisms are made most years vide Hlckinbotham's letter .o*c/393 dated the 21st March, 1946, and pelly^s demi-official letter No.0/961 dated the 3rd October, 1945, to me - but now that the figures of actual expenditure have been provided further comments are called for. V mi d # ' phe attached tables of estimates and actuals for 1364 show clearly that the Financial Adviser has once again greatly over-estimated expenditure and under-estimated revenue, and for half the heads of revenue the actual receipts range between half find half as much again as the estimates* This travesties the drawing up of a budget and defeats the purpose implicit in it, the apportioning of an accurately estimated income to considered purposes* I do not propose to discuss here the effect of this on the Bahrain public, but to confine the subject matter of this letter to the preparation and maintenance of the Bahrain accounts* 4. the State has spent less than the sums estimated on Defence, ^funicipalities. Oil Gauging, poor Relief, and Public Health measures (for which, due to prevalent condi tions, there may be some Justification) and has wound up the year with an allocation of Rs*18,84,548*7.0 towards the Reserve Fund, an excess of Ks*8,84,548*7*0 over the estimated figure and over and above the sum paid into the reserve fund from oil royalties* There seems no good reason why these Savings* should not be re-allocated in the next budget Instead of being lost to the public by being swallowed up in the general reserve fund. It is true that capital from the reserve has been used to finance major public services such as the bridge and the elctricity supply, but those services are run on a strictly economic basis* 5* It may not be possible to make a separate reserve fund for all the major heads of expenditure, but I am of the opinion that separate reserve funds should be started for public Health and Public t orlts. The State Medical Officer has recently inaugurated a campaign to advance the /general The Ton'Me Lt—Col* .R* ^y, G*^*!*, C.I*!*)*, political Resident in the Persian Gulf, (Camp) Bahrain *general conditions of health and hygiene In Bahrain and the money for this campaign, and for a project such as the new water supply system, should not be provlcied from current Income nor even from the General Reserve Fund, but rora funds built up for such special purposes• The balance In any year where the actual expenditure on Fuuj ic or public ' orKs Is less than the sum budgeted for ml^nc be credited to these separate heads. Thus a true accounc oi' expenditure on public services would be maintained and general allocation to the Reserve, the use of which is - and should be - closely watched, avoided. The Financial Adviser has promised to adopt the proposals recormend^ in paragraphs 5 and 6 of Government of India letter Ho .D »9680-&gt;i ( /4o dated the 22nd August, 1945, in his next budget, and we ?^U3t hope that this will help to create the separate reserve funds suggested above. I enclose a copy of his letuer. 6. The amounts by which the Financial Adviser's i36b estimates are greater or less than his 1364 estimates are as followst- LDLSS. Increase In 1365. ks. Oil Royalty 3,00,000 Customs 4,00,000 Land Revenue 9,000 Education 1,000 Passport Receipts 5,000 Bridge Tolls 70,000 Oil Gauging Fees 13,000 Miscellaneous 5,000 T ^cre t se in 1365 . Rs. interest from Reserve 1,30,000 Medical Receipts| Judicial Receipts Electric Supply Department 27,000 4,500 71,000 Increase in 1365 . Decrease in 1365 . Rs State Protection Municipalities Agriculture 20,000 9,000 6,000 Rs. Allowances to Ruling Family 1,00,000 State Departments 68,500 judicial Dept. 16,000 Fducation 1,95,500 public Health 30,000 public T^orks 2,15,000 Oil Gauging 2,000 The Financial Adviser has estimated that there will be a drop in bridge tolls, and I think this reasonable in view of the departure of Service personnel from Bahrain. similarly the evacuation of the R.A .F. wards in the Bahrain Government ttos- pital will mean a decrease in hospital receipts and the gradual abandonment of war time regulations may cause a decrease of receipts in the Law Courts. But his estimate that he will receive only Rs. 15,500 in judicial fees as against Fs.33,231.15.0 in 1364 seems somewhat Utopian. His figures for law 1 revenue also appear unduly moderate, particularly when it is reinembcred that both in 1363 and 1364 his actual receipts for this item were much in excess of his estimates, vide paragraph 3 of this /Agency. .....Agency letter No.C/393 dated the 2Xst March, 1946 7. , The Financial Adviser has budgeted for an Increased expenditure on public health and public works of ftu 1,95,500 and Rs.2 9 15 f 000 respectively over his 1364 estimates* He has also budgeted for an expenditure of Ks«2,00,000 on motor vehicles. Co offset this his estimates for State protection, IHmlclpalltles and Agriculture have been reduced by Bs.20,0001 Rs.9,000 and Rs.6,000 respectively compared with last year's estimates. The dlsbandment of the Special police will account for some of the drop In expenditure estimates on State protection. He has also abandoned Poor Relief, but thci subsidising of foodstuffs will continue. v^ 8. Further points for consideration are that the yearly statements received from the Financial Adviser, which In themselves as already pointed out give an uubulane^d picture, are not signed. Neither do we know that the auditor has actually passed them, rhe accounts are audited annually, paragraph 29 of my demi-official letter No.c/259 dated the 6th Ilarch, 1946, to Sir Geoffrey Prior Is, I regret to say, wron^ 9 and presumably the auditor does sign the staterients. For us to accept an unsigned statement forwarded under cover of a demi-official letter (I notice that In the past he has signed them) from the Financial Adviser Is open to criticism. I enclose copies of this year's statement, and the covering letter. It Is valueless to speculate as to why the Financial Adviser does not take this single precaution himself, but he does not and I suggest that I should tell hlzn that we require to see the final yearly statement of accounts as passed and signed by the auditors. 9. As regards accountancy staff, there has been consider able controversy concerning the late Incumbent of the Important post of accountant, and now that Ifr* Braganza, on whom the Financial Adviser pinned his faith - vide paragraph 3 of the enclosure to pelly's demi-official letter No. p.8 dated the 19th August, 1943, and In which connection Sir Olaf Caroe's note enclosed with Mr. cronlng's demi-official letter lfo.635-S of the 24th August, 1937, Is of Interest on this and the general question dealt with In this letter - has gone (this I learnt through an application for a liquor permit and not through any act of co-operation on Belgrave's part) Is the time to consider the adequate filling of the post* To my query regaruing his replacement and the ability of the new Incumbent efficiently to perform the duties of accountant, Belgrave has replied as followst- yu C-&amp; 'I propose appointing syed Mahmood Alawl to the post of Accountant which has become vacant owing to Ifr. Braganxa^ retirement subject to His High ness* approval. Syed ifahmood has been in the service of the Bahrain Government for about 17 years, he has held the post of Accountant and also that of Head Clerk and after discussing the matter with our Auditor 1 am satis fied that he is suitable and capable of carrying out the duties which were undertaken by Mr. Braganxa.* 1 /10. Xt... • i-i.. ■. r -4- 10. It is Impossible sitting in my chair to hazard more than a guess about the reliability of BelgraTe^ opinion of ?4r« Alawi. personally I do not like the sound of it at all y and do not hesitate to express my opinion that a properly trained man of much aigher calibre is required. The chief auditor himself told me that yearly he submitted some 40 pages of audit objections, and I think, we should find that a properly trained accountant is required. To enable me more accurately to estimate the position I propose to discuss the matter with the Financial Adviser. We need not go so closely into the State's internal workings by calling for a copy of the audit objections, but I should like to see one of his reports and propose to ask the financial Adviser to show me one. U. while on the subject of finance I should like to point out that the State, acting on^Hesidency advice vide Residency demi-official letter No.27S -S dated the 1st May| 1941, has a sum of 113 lakhs invested in Government of India stock. I think we should assure ourselves of the safety of this money, and the position of its availability for re investing elsewhere, now or later on, as may be thought necessary in view of the impending change of government inCopy of Demi-official letter No.501-21 dated the 6th March, 1946, from C.D. Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Adviser to theBahrain Government, to the political Agent, Bahrain. Reference your D.O. No,0/210 dated 25th February, 1946, the budget for the present year has already been made and approved by His Highness and it would be difficult at this stage to recast it on the lines suggested in your note. I am sorry that I did not receive this note before, in time to adopt the method which is laid down in it. 2. The life of the oil field was estimated in 1937 at 15 years. It would be interesting now to know what is its expectation of life in the opinion of the Company. Would it be possible to ask the Bahrain Petroleum Company whether we could be given a very rough 'without prejudice' 1 idea of how long the present output may last? The basis of the scheme appears to rest on this factor. 3. Apart from the electric scheme there is at present no important government undertaking which produces revenue and the budget on the expenditure side consists almost entirely of expenditure on public services and administration. His Highness has in mind a building scheme in Manama which includes the construction of a line of large shops which would be productive scheme but this was not included in the 1365 Budget as the material for the buildings is not likely to be available for some time. 4. I will prepare the next budget on the lines of your note and I hope by then that there will be certain productive schemes on which capital expenditure can be spent.GOKFIDaflTlAL.

Please refer to your demi-official letter No.C/576 dated the 4th June 1946* 2, I thoroughly agree with your criticisms but would note that my predecessor has recently spoken to Belgrave very plainly about his poor budgetting and the lack of progress that is being made in the State and that what is required now is steady pressure to bring about an improTement» *'ith this end in view I agree to the action proposed in paragraphs 8 and 10 of your letter^ 3. With reference to paragraph 5 of your letter i am inclined to think it will be better to adopt the headings suggested by the GoTemment of India in their letter to which you refer especially as the Financial Adviser has already been advised to adopt these headings* There are few productive schemes and the bulk of the savings should therefore be set aside for capital expenditure on unproductive schemes* Steps should then be taken to ensure that the money so set aside is spent for the benefit of the State and the public on public works* public health etc* 4* i have been particularly impressed since i came to Bahrain by the extremely bad state of the roads which causes loss both to the State and the public owing to the unnecessary wear and tear on motor transport* i would ask that the Financial Adviser should be pressed to io^rove the state of the roads as soon as possible* T l o( \ b* X observe from paragraph 15 of the note recorded by my predecessor on his discussions with Belgrave vide enclosure to Residency Printed Letter Ko» 410-3 dated the 6th April 1946 that Belgrave stated that the Muharraq swing bridge had not yet paid for its initial cost but that this position would shortly be reached agnd that it was then proposed to make the bridge free of all tolls* If you see no objection would you kincly ascertain when this position is likely to be reached* It appears to roe that in view of its satisfactory financial position the ^tate could well afford to forego these tolls at once* If it does not do this it should at least put the road across the causeway into a proper condition* Its present state is disgraceful* 6* I see from paragraph 6 of your letter that revenue from interest on the Reserve is expected to drop to the extent of fts* l f 50 t 000 during 1566* This appears odd especially in view of the big increase in the Heserve and I should be grateful for an explanation*GOWtlD&amp;m!lAU D»0 &gt;Ho*C/533 &gt; Office of the Political Resident, Pereian Qulf, Camp, Bahrain, the 24th July 1946. Belgrave told me today that during the war the Shaikh has been supplementing the allowances paid to his nunerous relatiyes from his own share of the oil royalties* He now finds hixaself short of money and wishes to reimburse himself by drawing from the State treasury a sum of Rupees four or five lakhs which is roughly what he has spent on these additional allowances# He also wishes to increaae his Civil List by about Ss 50,000/- to be distributed amongst the various recipients in dearness allowances which it is his intention to reduce or withdraw according as deamess allowances paid to Government servants etc. are reduced or withdrawn. 2. Belgrave told me that he had not informed the Shaikh that he is mentioning the matter to me and that for the present he is trying to choke him off. He would be grateful for advice regarding the course he should follow. 3, Would you kindly let me have your views upon the subject. Lieut.-Colonel A«C.Galloway, C.

The Bahrain Government spent approximately 1^760000 on the causeway and bridge of which 485000 was the cost of the bridge. ' The Government has now recovered approximately Rs 192000 against the cost of the whole work, out of this sum 32000 has been set aside in a Bridge Depreciation Account, The balance of the cost of the whole work bridge and causeway, is Rs 568000 the balance of the cost of the bridge only is 293000. To recover the latter amount at the rate of 28000 p.a. would take about 11 years. The sum of 28000 is the estimated surplus of revenue from the tolls after deducting running expenses. Running expenses are estimated at about 25000 p.a. and annual revenue at about 53000. Previous revenue from tolls amounted to 1361 1362 1363 1364 37,600 36,600 66,200 98,800 The high figure for the last two years was mainly due to the presence in Bahrain of a very large number of service vehicles, R.A.F., Army, and U.S.A .T.C., which used the bridge and paid bridge tolls.

As early as 1935 Government seeras to have succeeded in establishing the principle, vide correspondence ending with Residency letter No. 1018-S dated the 20th December, 1935, that the oil royalties were to be divided in the proportion of one third to the Ruler and Ruling Family and two thirds to the Bahrain Government. It was subsequently laid down by the Political Agent on the instructions of the Political Resident that no additions should be made to the Civil List estimates and that any extra expenditure in this connection should be met from the one third share of the oil royalty, which was declared to be a contribution towards the Civil List, please see in this connection the attached copies of letters exchanged by this Agency with the late Ruler and Belgrave. 3. in view of the above I am strongly averse to allowing His Highness to draw any additional money from the State treasury or to make any further additions to the Civil List. During the last six years he has received an average of Es. 13,20,000 a year from the Oil Royalty and the Civil List, enough to leave him a very handsome balance after paying the A1 Khalifah allowances and meeting his other expenses. He receives in addition 6$ on the value of every goat, sheep,, and cow brought into the island, and has besides a private income of between Ss .120,000 and 150,000 a year from his town properties and other investments. I should add here that Shaikhs Mahommed bin Isa and Abdullah bin isa are also in receipt of comfortable private incomes and that these two Shaikhs between them receive no less than one third of all the allowances and bonuses His Highness pays the Al Khalifah, vide the enclosure to this Agency demi-official letter No. C/187 dated the 11th February, 1943. In view of this perhaps \ the best answer to His Highness would be that suggested in Sir Geoffrey prior f s demi-official letter No. 150-S dated the 13th February, 1943. &lt;; 4. Sir Geoffrey speaks of Shaikh Salman as living well within his income, and all that I hear of His Highness confirms this. It is not understood how he now claims to be short of money, unless we accept his view that the whole of the one third share of the oil royalty belongs to him and that ne should be reimbursed for any payments he makes from it to other members of the Ruling Family. Apart from the question of principle involved his one third share of the royalty is a very large sum indeed which, in view of the Bahrain Petroleum Company's mounting production, is likely to increase still further. It will be seen from correspondence ending with Mr. Weightman's demi-official letter No. c /757 -10 /1 dated the 7th October, 1940 that it was at one time contemplated that the one third share of the oil royalty would eventually be reduced to a fifth or even a tenth, and that this proposal was discussed with Shaikh Salman himself. ■ The Hon'ble Lt.-Colonel W.R. Hay, C .S. I.,C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Bahrain.j suggest, therefore, that when the Shaikh returns to the attack Belgrave should inform him that in view of the correspondence referred to in paragraph two of this letter he must consult me regarding His Highness»s suggestions, and that I should then be authorised to write to Belgrave and inform him that we cannot agree to His Highness 1 s proposals for the reasons I have stated above. /•v d ■Confidential.

Will you kindly refer to your demi-official letter No. 1163-^A dated the 30th ^anuary 1936 about allowances for two of His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin ^sa A1 Khalifah's younger sons. 2. The intention underlying my letter No. C/607-4/1 dated the 17th June 1934, which was written with the approval of the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian U ulf, was that no further increase should be made to the Civil List, which already formed too high a proportion of the expenditure of the State. In the circumstances any new allowance of this sort should, 1 think, be met from the one-third of the oil royalties. Sd. G.Loch.

I have the honour to inform you that I have received from His Highness Shaikh Sulman a letter, of which I enclose a copy, ordering a payment from State Funds to His Highness's Privy purse of Rs. 400,000/-, on account of the war allowance which His Highness has paid to the Ruling Family. In this connection please refer to my D.Q. NO .1750-9A dated 15th August 1946 on the subject of His Highness's finances. This payment has not been provided for in the Budget. 0 ^ &amp; )Adviser's demi-official letter NO.1760-9A dated 15th August, 1946, to captain H.D.H. Ranee, political Agent, Bahrain. I wish to refer to the question of His Highness's privy purse and the State civil List which came into existence when the late ruler, H.H. Shaikh Hamad, became Deputy Euler. The civil list was intended to cover the Ruler's personal expenditure and to provide salaries to members of the Ruling Family. The civil list, in which I include an item then described as 'Religious Festivals and Summer Moves' which was also paid to the Ruler, was as follows:- year 1344 1345 1346 1^47 1348 civil list 4,40,000 4,53,600 4,62,000 5,04,000 5,08,000 total revenue 10,62,000 11,92,000 12,40,000 12,16,000 11,34,000 (in 1348 the civil list was limited to not more than 5,00,000 and in 1349 reductions of 10^ were made in many cases owing to the financial situation.) 1349 1350 1351 4,88,500 4,34,700 4,13,800 8,18,000 7,96,000 6,84,000 (Shaikh Isa, who was in receipt of an allowance died in 1351.) 1352 3,76,700 7,26,000 16,47,000 43,36,000 48,11,^ 45,78, 49,00, 44,32, \J\j\J 39,81,000 (In 1362 there was a further 2^ cut in the civil ' list. ) 1353 3,79,000 8,87,000 1354 3,92,000 13,43,000 (Cuts in the civil list restored) 1355 4,34,600 1356 4,45,700 1357 4,45,700 1358 4,38,000 1359 4,34,000 1360 4,34,000 1361 4,28,000 (H.H.

It will be seen from these figures that at a time when the revenue of the State was very much less than it is now the civil list was about 75,000 higher. His High ness now considers that in view of the increased revenue of the State, apart from the Oil royalty, the civil list should be increased. My own suggestion is that it should revert to 4-^- lakhs or 5 lakhs.

Jf tl^e civil list were increased it would relieve His Highness a Tittle 'of the large monthly payments which he makes to his relations. All His Highness f s personal accounts are kept by me and all payments are made by me on behalf of His Highness through his account and there is no doubt as to the facts about his financial position. Out of his proportion of the oil royalty His Highness pays allowances to all those of the Khalifah who were not included in the original civil list. He also pays a bonus of two months salary, twice yearly, on receipt of the oil royalty, to all persons on the civil list and pays every year 48,000 to both Shaikh Mohamed and Shaikh Abdulla. For some years he has paid a cost of living allowance of 30,^ of salaries to all of the Khalifah who are in receipt of allowances. In addition His Highness gives away monies that over a year amount to a large sum to innumerable people aias outside the family who ask his financial help. The reputation which His Highness has . acquired of being miserly is in fact one which is entirely unjustified. His Highness's share of the oil royalty is approximately 10 lakhs, out of this he makes the regular payments which I have enumerated above, they amount to about 3^- lakhs per annum. Supplementary civil list, to cover persons not included in the civil list and adjustments in various allowances Rs.1,22,680 Half yearly oil bonus ... 1,58,200 Cost of living allowance ... 66,300 Rs.3,46,100 His Highness^ own expenses have increased greatly since the war and he feels that while his family 1 sh high cost of living has been partly compensated for by extra allowances no considera tion has been given to his own situation. The extra allowances which his family receive are paid out of his own income which has therefore diminished while at the same time his expenses have risen. His Highness was unwilling to take any steps in this matter during the war but he now feels that something must be done. At the end of last month he had nothing to his credit in his bank account. For many years during the rule of the late Shaikh Hamad I opposed his desire to increase the civil list and I was eventual ly successful in tying it down to its present size. At that time the position was different and the revenue was small in comparison to what it is today. For all these years I have been an opponent of increasing the payments to the Ruling Family, sometimes at the cost of much unpleasantness, but conditions have changed, it cannot be argued that the State is not wealthy and His Highness Shaikh Salman is a very different person, where money matters are concerned, to his father. In my opinion His Highness has some cause for complaint, many of the payments to the family were instituted by his father and it would be difficult at present to put an end to them. His argument that his costs of living have increased is quite true and it is true that he helps the family to the extent of certainly not less than one third of his own income from the oil money. My suggestion is that the civil list should be increased to 5 lakhs a year and that His Highness should be paid 4 lakhs to compensate/for the extra payments which he has been making to the family during the war. He has agreed that as soon as other cost of living allowances are lowered he will reduce or do away with the allowances to the Khalifah family.

I enclose a copy of a letter from Smith reporting increases in the pay of Bahrain Government servants and of those on the Civil List, which have already been brought into effect. The increases in the allowances of those on the Civil List require your approval, and I feel that they should not have been brought into effect in anticipation of it. 3. The increase in the wages of labour employed by the Bahrain Government (I understand it is -/12/- a day for working days only) and the increase in Dearness Allowance from 25^ to 50^ for persons drawing less than Rs.300/-p.m. are, in my view, justified. An increase in the wages paid to labourers was inevitable; and the Bahrain Government were having difficulty in recruiting and retaining any but the least employable clerks on their previous scales of pay. * 4. The increases in the higher paid posts and in the allowances of those on the Civil List are also Justified by the general increase in the wages of ser vants and in the cost of living generally that will result from the Arabian American Oil Company's action in increasing wages. 5. The additional purchasing power released by the Bahrain Government (and other employers will have to follow them) will increase the demand for goods already in short supply; and, with the increase in the cost of food, will aggravate the present inflation in Bahrain. It constitutes, therefore, an argument against undue relaxation of internal price controls; but the release of new purchasing power itself has been dictated by the action of the Arabian American Oil Company over which the Bahrain Government have no control, 6. I should be grateful if I could be informed whether you approve of the increases in salaries and allowances already conceded by the Bahrain Government. The Hon'ble Lt-Col. A.C.

He has also ordered a 20,t increase on the present rate of 30^ on the Civil List salaries and a raise in the wages of labour employed by the P.W.D. and other Government departments. ^ The total cost to the Government of this raise without the labour wages will be around Rs. 5,50,000/- per year. This does not include the Electricity Department and the Food Control Department because these departments pay their own revenue so the amount involved by the raise in dearness allowances will be met from the revenue of two departments. The order has been put into effect and the increase will be paid from first of the Current Arabic month.

BAHRAIN r the 13th October, 1947 Please refer to paragraph 6 of your demi-official letter No»C/989 dated the 1st October, 1947. 2. It appears that a 30 per cent dearness allowance was granted to persons on the Civil List some years ago and that this was paid out of the Shaikhs share of the oil royalties. In my demi-official letter No.362«S dated the 26th February, 1947, I agreed to the payment to the Shaikh from general revenues of a lump sum of Rs.4 lakhs partly because the matter was already a ^pcyjnpH, and partly becuase Belgrave both verbally and in writing c.f. paragraph 6 of his demi-official letter No.l760-9A dated the 15th August, 1946, to Ranee stated that the Shaikh was really out of funds, butfdid not concur in the future payment of the 30 per cent dearness allowance from general revenues. In fact this point was not referred to me. It is not clear whether this original 30 per cent dearness allowance is now being paid from general revenues or from the Shaikhs royalties nor from which source the additional 20 per cent allowance is now to be paid. 3. If you see no objection would you kindly therefore reply to Smiths letter No.2234-22 dated the 20th September, 1947. and ask^Mm to confirm the presumption that both the original 30 percent allowance and the new 20 per cent allowance will be met from the Shaikhs share of the oil royalties whftch owing to increased production has now risen to about 13 lakhs of rupees per annum. 4 Jackson, Esquire, M.B.E., Political Agent, umm •LB*D.O.

I regret to have to say that Belgrave has not con firmed the presumption that both the 30% dearness allowance and the new 20% will be met from the Shaikh's share of the oil royalties. Indeed, he has stated that His Highness has now ordered that the whole dearness allowance at the rate of 30% of the Civil List salaries is to be paid from general revenues. The first payment at the new rate was made from them last month. „ ^ I 3. You will observe from the correspondence referred to ^/Rance by StaiiMajt^in his letter No. C/910, dated the 17th August, 1946 - and particularly from prior's demi-official letter No.150-S dated the 13th February, 1943, and Weightman's demi-official letter No.G/757-10/1, dated the 7th October, 1940 - that this is a question that has for some years past considerably exercised former political Agents^ and Residents, and that a great deal of patient and sometimes unpleasant work has been done both to keep the Rulers' privy purse within its present limits and to prepare the ground for an eventual reduction in the Ruler's share of the Oil Royalties from the third that he at present enjoys. 4. v It is apparent also that there are occasions in our dealings with the Rulers of Bahrain when some one has firmly to say 'No' to the ever-recurring demands for increases iTi their share of the State's income; and, in my view, this occasion is one of them. By arbitrarily increasing the Civil List salaries at the expense of the State's general revenues the Ruler has disregarded all the principles that have been established by much patient work over a period of years; and, if this is condoned now, the whole basis of the present administration of Bahrain - which has been built up to certain standards by the expenditure of the major portion of thfe State's income on the administration, rather than by allowing the Ruler to spend it on himself and the Al Khalifah - will be undermined. /There is a The Hon'ble Lt-col. Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain. 3 -vcThere is a limit to the extent that Belgrave, who is the Shaikh's own servant, can check him in this respect; and the responsibility Tor doing so rests (as long as it is Ills Majesty's government's policy to concern themselves with the administration of the State in the interest of our defence and other commitments here) with the Political Agent, and, ultimately, with the Resident. 5. Nor should we ignore, or omit to prepare for, the fact that some day the people of Bahrain may insist on taking an increasing share in the administration of the Stace. ,/hen public opinion develops and becomes more vocal - a condition that will result from education and increasing contacts with the outside world - it is likely to be directed against defects in che administration; against the personal affluence of the Ruler and the A1 Khalifah; and, by analogy, against us because we have per mit tea these things. The facts that the Ruler's personal income exceeds some £120,000 a year, free of tax, and that, in addition, certain of his personal expenses and the allowances to his family are paid from the general revenues will not then be lost upon informed members of the public. Indeed, they are not now. Also, His Ilajesty's Government have, I understand, already directed their Middle East Office to work for the wider distribution of wealth in the Arab world. Thus, any relaxation of our efforts to keep the Ruler's share of the State's income within its present bounds, or any acquiescence in increases in the A1 khalifah's allowances at the expense of the general revenues, would appear to be not only a retrograde rather Chan a forward step towards the emancipation of the people of Bahrain, but contrary to His Majesty's Government's recently formulated policy. 6. 1 would urge, therefore, that the Political Agent be authorised to inform the Ruler that His Majesty's Government are now, as in the past, strongly averse to the increased allowances on the Civil List salaries - which ?/ere sanctioned by the Ruler without consulting the Political Agent - being charged to general revenues; and that he should meet them irom his share of the oil royalties, or from his own reserves. tl if ! r| m••K CONFIDENTIAL PfOt PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY. BAHRAI N, the 26th November 1947• Please refer to your demi-official letter No.C/10&amp;3 dated the 9th November, 1947, on the subject of the Bahrain Civil List, 2. I enclose herewith a copy of a very useful note which has been prepared by Croning, 3# I feel that before asking His Majesty's Govern ment for authority to inform the Shaikh on the lines proposed in paragraph 6 of Jackson^ letter you or I or both of us must endeavour to persuade him in a personal interview to meet all or part of the cost of the Civil List dearness allowance from his share of the oil royalties and that before we do this we must be very sure of our facts. Fcrjinstance Belgrave in his demi-official letter No«1760-9A dated the 16th August, 194C, tries to make out that the Shaikh really cannot afford to pay the allowance from this source. Can we counter Belgrave^ arguments ? 4. My view at present is that the grant of dearness allowance at 60% on Civil List salaries is reasonable under present conditions and that it is only the source from which it should be paid that is in issue. If you do not agree with this view you will no doubt let me know. C.J. Pelly. Esquire, O.B.E., Political Agent, PAHfiAINJ V ^ As far back as 1933 In paragraph 2 of his letter dated 5th Habl ath-Thani 1362, Shaikh Hamad accepted the convention that.the Ruler should get 1/3 and the State 2/3rd of the royalties from oil (enclosure to Bahrain P.L. No,0/341- l.b/7 dated 17th August, 1933)• Beyond this letter no formal undertaking was given by him but the convention was well estab- « lished by 1936 vide Sir. Trenchard Fowle's letter N0.IOI8-S ^ dated 20th December 1936 (copy sent to Bahrain under P.L. No.l019-S dated 20th December, 1936), and has been referred to in subsequent correspondence with the Ruler. In 1940 the Political Agent, Mr. Weightman, discussed (D.O. No.C/767-10/1 dated 7th October, 1940) with Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Salman the desirability of reducing the Shaikh's 1/3 share to l/6th or less but no conclusion was arrived at. 0 \ In his demi official letter No.C/77-4/1% dated the 16th February 1936 to the Adviser Colonel Loch, the Political -V Agent intimated that the intention underlying an earlier letter of 1934 to the Shaikh was that no further increase should be made in the Civil List and that nay new allowances to the A1 Khalifah family should be met from the l/3rd of the royalties allotted to the Ruler. This was apparently acquiesced in at the time. ^ ^ • x ^ fW In 1941 Shaikh Hamad wr.te (vide his letter dated 13th Safar 1360 to the Adviser) desiring to help himself to 2 lakhs from the 1/3 royalty credited to State general revenues (the remaining 1/3 being credited to the Reserve Fund), 1 lakh v to meet the cost of entertaining and 1 lakh to supplement the allowances to the A1 Khalifah family. In his reply N0.183-S, ^ dated the 10th April 1941 (copy sent to Bahrain under P.L. N0.187-S dated 10th April, 1941) the Political Resident, Sir Geoffrey Prior, informed the Shaikh (paragraph 6) that he had always thought that the 1/3 share enjoyed by His Highness was excessive and was about to ask His Highness if he could see his way to reduce it; also (paragraph 7) that he hoped that if His Highness wished to increase the emoluments of the A1 Khalifah h he hoped that His Highness would do it from the l/3rd of the royalties enjoyed by His highness or the amount His Highness spent on bedouin. In his reply dated the 8th Rabi-al-Thani - 1360 Shaikh Hamad appreciated the Political Resident's advice but merely agreed that the State reserve should not be touched. No undertaking was given by Shaikh Hamad or has been given by Shaikh Salman that post-1934 increases in the allowances of the A1 Khalifah family would be met from the Ruler's 1/3 share of royalties, and the latter's action summarised in S.No.56 (P.R's demi official letter No.l783-S dated 13th October, 1947, to Mr. Jackson) shows that he has not accepted the principle.

The 14th of December, 1947 \ ) / J v 4 v V Please refer to the correspondence ending with your demi-official letter No. 2022-s, dated the 26th November, 1947, on the subject of the Bahrain Civil List. 2. I have had several conversations with Belgrave on the subject, and he is quite as disturbed as we are by the Shaikh's action and, indeed, before I had read the papers, he asleep me what we were going to do about it. He said, and I believe him, that this would never have happened if he had been here. He explained that what has actually happened is that the Shaikh has increased the Civil List from Rs.4,20,000 to Rs.6,30,000. In round figures this two lakhs' increase which the State budget has to bear is made up of (a) 1 lakh which the Shaikh formerly paid himself from his share of the oil royalty (b) 1 lakh increases in the cost of living allowance. Belgrave agreed with me that whatever excuse there might be for adding (b) to the State budget, there is none whatsoever for similar action in respect of (a). It seems to me largely academic to argue as to whether there was a 'principle' that increases in the cost of living allowances of the A1 Khalifah should be met from the Ruler's 1/3 share of the royalties. But it is clear from past correspondence that we were consulted, expected to be consulted, gave advice, and that the advice was taken in questions concerning Bahrain Crovernment finances, and^especially in those concerning the allowances of the Ruler and his family. The Shaikh has now flouted our authority as exercised in the past in this way; , it seems to me in keeping with this attitude as described in my demi-official letter No.C/619, dated the 24th of May, 1947, though whether one regards this as 'deterioration' in the local position is, I suppose, largely a matter of a point of view. {J, k /3.

I am rather at a loss for any suggestion as to what we should do. The changes were made nearly three months ago and a protest at that range will have little effect. The fact too that, as I understand, the Shaikh's orders have, of course, been acted upon since he passed them makes it exceedingly difficult.if not impossible.for him to change them, even if we should ever persuade him to consider doing so. Still, as I anticipate similar moves in future, it will be better to protest against this one. Such a protest might, I suggest, take the form of a letter from you in which a chief point should be that out of a revenue of 86,00,000 per annum, 19,00,000 (12 lakhs oil royalty and 6 lakhs Civil List) go to the A1 Khalifah. 4. I am inclined to agree with your view that an allowance at 50 per cent on Civil List salaries is reasonable in present conditions. My view that we have not heard the last of such increases is based on the fact that, as emphasized by Jackson in his demi-official letter No.C/990, dated the 2nd October, 1947, the 'inflationary spiral' has, after our successful avoidance of it during the war, at last appeared in Bahrain. 'C Xo ( £lt ^COKFIDENTIAL P .O. No.2186-S PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY . BAHRAIN , the 19th December 1947 V 6&gt;• Please refer to your demi-official letter No.C/1191 dated the 14th December 1947 on the subject of the Bahrain Civil List, 2. I note that Belgrave has agreed that there is no excuse whatever for the Shaikhs decision that the one lakh contribution which he previously paid to the Civil List from his share of the oil royalty should no* be paid from general revenues. Belgrave is the Shaikh's Financial Adviser and it is for him to point out to the Shaikh in the first place the impropriety of his action. It is not clear whether he has done this or not. If he has not, would you kindly suggest to him, if you see no objection, that he should take action on these lines now and let you know the result. 3. My own view is inclined to be that as the Shaikh's share of the royalty has increased from 10 lakhs to over 11 lakhs he should contribute not only the lakh which he previous ly paid but also the further lakh required to cover the recent increases in cost of living allowance. I am still however at a loss to know how the Shaikh expends his very large share of the royalty. I have already raised this point in paragraph 3 of my demi-official letter No.2022-S dated the 26th November. Can you obtain any information on the subject ? I 9*1 it- C.J'. Pelly, Esquire, O.B.E. , Political Agent, BAHRAIN ICopy of Political Agent, Bahrain's demi-official letter No. C/1237 dated 29.12.'47 to C.D. Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Adviser to zhe Bahrain Government, Bahrain. You may remember that about a fortnight ago we dis cussed the increases made by His Highness in the Civil List. You explained to me that what has actually happened is that the Shaikh has increased the Civil List (in round figures) from over four lakhs oo over six lakhs, i.e. by two lakhs made up of (a) 1 lakh which the Shaikh formerly paid himself from his share of the oil royalty, and (b) 1 lakh increases in the cost of living allowance — these two lakhs being now charged on the State budget. I gathered that you agreed with me that whatever excuse there might be for adding (b) to the State budget there is none whatsoever for similar action in respect of (a). I made this point to Sir Rupert, and he ha^ inquired from me whether you advised the Shaikh againsc adding (a) to the State budget or not? I suppose you did, but would you please confirm 9 2. Sir Rupert has also raised the point as to how the Shaikh expends his very large share of the oil royalty. There is a good deal of correspondence on my files about this, but it is mostly out of date. You told me that His Highness still pays from his oil royalty 8s. 2,61,000 in salaries and Hs.90,000 in 'ad hoc' payments to members of the A1 Khalifah, etc., while his^bwn salary is now Ss. 16,250/-. These figures account for about 5^- lakhs per—annum, out there remains a balance of the present oil royalty (13 lakhs) of lakhs. Can you give me up-to-date figures indicating how this is spent?Copy of demi-official letter NO.508-22/2A dated 12.1.1948 from C.D.

The 17th MarcU&gt; 1948, jr /7f Enclosed is a copy of Belgrave^ letter^ No.758-22/9A dated the 12th February, 1948, which is the result of my speaking to him about the Bahrain Civil List increases as you asked me to do in your demi-official letter N0.I86 -S dated the 20th January, 1948. 2. My comments on His Highness^ 'arguments' 1 are as follows;- ? 6^ I have no record of the Shaikh having refer red to Galloway, and presumably you have none. The letter written by Smith to which Belgrave refers was presumably the enclosure to Jackson 1 s demi-official letter No.C/989 dated the 1st October, 1947, to Galloway. The letter was far from clear on the question of the incidence of the increases sanctioned by the Shaikh, and it would have needed a clairvoynt to discover that, as well as sanctioning cost of Ifving allowance the Shaikh was going to charge a lac to the State budget which he formerly paid himself. 3. The argument^ at (b) contradict^ by implication^ that at (a), i.e. if the arrangement about oil royalties was as stated by the Shaikh then there was no necessity to refer to the political Agent. I don't want to add to the considerable noting and correspondence on this point, but Weightman f s view of it as late as 1940 (vide his demi-official letter No.C/285-4/1 dated the 6th April, 1940, to prior - paragraph 4) Is interesting. 6.65 4. As to argument (c) the point,\I think, is as made in paragraph 2 of my letter No.C/1191 dated the 14th December, 1947. We have been consulted in the past and past precedent in the matter should be acted upon. The correspondence about the allowance for Shaikh Da ! ij (Political Agent's letter No.C/415-4/1 dated the 21st April, 1934, to the Hon'ble the political Resident refers) is a remarkable instance of the extent to which we were consulted. 6. I propose, if you agree, to discuss the Shaikh's action with him ; to counter his arguments in the manner /indicated, The Hon'ble Lt-Col. Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain . 'i Jd- 613 / /f • 1I • -2- indicated above, and to point out to him that our advice to him regarding his personal expenditure is in his own interest since the time has come when it is no longer free from public criticism. His threat about refusing to sign the budget as mentioned by Belgrave in paragraph 3 of his letter is, I think, only one of his usual histrionic efforts. If he mentions Kuwait to me, I imagine that the reply is that the finances need controlling/ though naturally I would not venture to give it. The comparison to Saudi Arabia is inappropriate and ridiculous. NS.rn PERSONAL . Copy of letter No,768-22/9A dated 12.2.*48 from C.D. Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E*, Adviser to the Bahrain Govern ment, to the political Agent, Bahrain. — ^ -' Referring to your No.C/133 dated 26th January, 1948, I had a long talk with His Highness on the subject of the Civil List and the increases and changes ^hich were made while I was away. His Highness did not appreciate my bring ing up the subject and would not budge an inch. He produced the following arguments. 2. (a) The increases were made with the knowledge of Galloway who, he said, was aware of all that was done. He also said that a letter was written to the political Agent by the Acting Adviser, Smith, in which it was clearly stated that some payments previously made by His Highness were to be met from State funds not from the Privy purse. I have seen the letter and the wording of it is perhaps liable to cause a misunderstanding though if the letter is studied carefully the fact emerges that payments made by His High ness were to be met in future by the State. (b) The arrangement about oil royalties, made when Loch was political Agent, was discussed in the presence of Loch, Shaikhs Mohamed, Abdullah and Shaikh Salman and myself and it was agreed that 1/3 of the royalty was to be paid to the Ruler and one third was to be for the Ruling Family, the other third was to be spent on the State. I told His High ness that this was incorrect. He continued to say that the original arrangement was as he stated. (c) If he is the Ruler of Bahrain he has the right to allocate the revenue to whatever purpose he wishes, if he is restricted in financial matters he is not the real ruler of the State but merely the chief of the Khalifah Family with control over one third of the oil royalty. This, he regards, as an impossible paM position. 3. His Highness appeared to be willing to discuss the matter with you and the Resident, he said that the matter should either be discussed or should be the subject of an exchange of letters. He also said that if in future he had not a free hand with the revenue he would refuse to approve and sign any budget. He also mentioned that in other xxtarsx States in the Gulf the Rulers were not questioned about the manner in which they disposed of the revenue, he quoted Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. 4. our talk lasted for over two hours and His Highness was extremely angry. I think that this matter should be dis cussed as soon as possible but that before any discussion tMk takes place the records which you have regarding the disposal of the oil royalty should be looked into. I am quite certain, as I told His Highness, thatil was agreed that the Ruler should receive one third of the royalty and that two thirds should be utilised on the State. Another point which he stressed was that the Civil List should depend upon the revenue of the State, other than the oil royalty. Before oil produced any revenue the State had a maximum income of 13 lakhs per annum, now it has an income of twice this amount so therefore, he contended, the Civil List should be allowed to increase, in proportion to the revenue (other than from oil).CONFIDENTIAL p.O.No.G^g PERSUN GULF RESIDENCY BAHRAIN Dated the 23rd ^arch, 1948 Please refer to your Demi-official letter Ng.C /277 dated the 17th March, 1948 about the Bahrain Civil List. 2. I fully approve the line you propose to take. I suggest that you should lay emphasis on modern democratic tendencies and the scandal that will be caused in the world at large when the very large proportion of the State revenues (including oil royalties) which is devoted to the Al-Khalifah becomes known especially as most of them give no return what ever for the expenditure. 3. If the Shaikh mentions Kuwait you can say, with truth, that so far as we are aware the Shaikh is reserving the whole of the oil royalties for local developments. 4. v You will no doubt realise that this is not a matter in which we can give anything in the nature of an 'order' to the Shaikh, Your general attitude should be that you are offering him advice for his own good end that of his State. ^fou can if necessary remind him of what he owes to His Majesty's Government's protection and refer to the displeasure likely to be felt by His Majesty^ Government when the matter is reported to them. 5. With reference to paragraph 2 of your letter we have no record of any reference to Galloway. I think it quite probable that the Shaikh may have mentioned to him his proposal to increase his Civil List dearness allowances in general terms but most unlikely that he made specific reference to the transfer of liability for a portion of these allowances from his share of the oil royalties to general revenues. J. Pelly, Esquire, O.B.E., rexj.^, Political Agent IdlMIii •LB*4 - ■ o -)\M' COMFIDENTIAL . D.O.No.C/350. POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 6th April, 194§^ Ml I took up the/sratter of the Civil List referred to in your d.o. N0.638-S, dated the 23rd March, 1948, with the Shaikh yesterday. 2. I tried to make the point that it is not the Shaikh's expenditure on his family that we are questioning, but the incidence of that expenditure on the State Budget. As usual, the Shaikh avoided the real issue by saying that he had to increase the allowances because prices have gone much higher - a proposition which it was impossible to contradict. He went over (for about an hour) more or less the points he made to Belgrave, though he did not say that the increases were made with the knowledge of Galloway. When he mentioned Kuwait, I said that Kuwait ought to take Bahrain as an example, and he should not argue that Bahrain should follow Kuwait's example - he avoided this argument. I then told him that the light of publicity^shone upon Bahrain and there was bound to be public criticism if a dis proportionate amount ofthe State's income is spent on the Al -Khalifah. He said that he only disposed of one-third of the royalties and that the other two-thirds are devoted to State purposes. This is important. He did not argue that one-third of the royalties should be paid to the Ruler and one-third to the Ruling Family. I hope that if he contemplates a further move of this kind that he will refer to us in future; and at this late stage that is all we can hope for. , The Hon'ble Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSI, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN. r j p p — r^-'CY I \N0 , /, tic 'M £ t CO a' F .DE '.-m A L RECORDS</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000148_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/355</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000148</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/355</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 19/176 VI Bahrain Finances'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1941/1948</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2013-11-26T11:06:31</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (125 folios)</extent><extent>File is arranged in chronological order, from earliest at beginning of the file to most recent at end.</extent><extent>Previously a bound correspondence file but the sheets have now been unbound and are loose.
