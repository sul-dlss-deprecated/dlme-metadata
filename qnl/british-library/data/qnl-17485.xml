Stannus reports that his trip to the Arab coast has been in vain, and that he has been unable to prevent further hostilities taking place. Stannus describes the possible measures to be taken against Raḥmah bin Jābir should he continue his hostile actions, including seizing his boats and destroying his fort. The letters to others, including Raḥmah bin Jābir and Captain Walker, which Stannus mentions as enclosures to his letter, are not included in the file.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054933.0x000029#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
