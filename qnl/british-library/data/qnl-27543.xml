With reference to ■/ telegram Ho. 275 of October 22nd, I hare the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a translation of the note which I hare recelred from the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of the search of the Kuwaiti dhow rt Fath-ul-Khair M off Buahlre on May 21st. 2. You will see that the fact of the search is admitted and that no attempt is made to deny that It took place on the high seas, although this is probably the case which the Minister for Foreign Affairs had in mind when he reminded me that Persia claimed a ten mile (he nay hare meant ten kilometres) limit for territorial waters (see my telegram No. 265 of October 15th, paragraph 7). 5. The excuse giren for refusing the boat's crew permission to come on board the warship while the master of the dhow was being interrogated is a pretty poor one and so far as I am aware quite untrue as a generalisation. 4. The explanation of the incident of the trained and loaded gun is a typical non-sequltur of the kind in which Persian official notes abound. 5. The penultimate paragraph raises an issue with which I shall deal separately. 6. I suggest that I should in due course send a written reply indicating that His Majesty's Government do not admit the right of Persian vessels to search British or British protected dhows on the high seas, however strong the suggestion of smuggling may be, and dealing briefly, perhaps in a mildly sarcastic vein, with the two points of detail mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 3 above.

(1) Koweiti dhow with cargo of sugar and groceries properly manifested for Fao seized in Shatt-el-Arab (almost certainly in Iraq waters) by Persian Customs on 6th December, 1932, on suspicion of smuggling; crew of 4 detained for 9 days without food except their own cargo; Captain, a Koweiti subject, still detained without trial so far as known and dhow also detained; no answer has apparently been received to further representations made by His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, Tehran, on 29th July, 1933 (P.Z. 5219/33). (2) Koweiti bum arrested early in April, 1933, by Persian warship ”BABR' about 4 miles off Henjam, for which he was making in heavy sea to mend her sails, and taken forcibly to Bandar Abbas before being released; damage done to bum variously estimateafrom Es.200 to Rs. 400; very unsatisfactory answer received from Persians in reply to representations of His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, Tehran, is summarised in Tehran telegram No. 276 of 22nd October, 1933 (P.Z.6803/33). (3) Large Koweiti dhow forcibly inspected on 21st May, 1933, by Persian gunboat off Bushire (probably not in Persian waters) on pretext of searching for opium; Master of dhow insulted; very unsatisfactory reply received from Persians to our protest at Tehran (Tehran telegram No. 275 of 22nd October, 1933 - P.Z. 6811/33). (4) Persian armed launch anchored with captured (Persian) dhow on 12th June, 1933, in Muscat territorial waters, near Khasab, and is suspected of having used Muscat waters as a base for its activities; Persian reply2 . (5) ( 7 ) to protest made at Tehran on behalf of Muscat denied that any Persian warship or Customs launch was near Khasab on the date mentioned (Tehran telegram No.278 of 22nd October, 1933 - P.Z. 6810/33). Island of Tarab visited on 23rd July, 1933, by Persian warship 'PA1ANS” and lighthouse officially inspected by Persian officers; His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, Tehran, protested against the violation of status quo agreement; thoroughly unsatisfactory reply from Persians is summarised in Tehran telegram No. 277 of 22nd October, 1933 (P.Z. 6809/33). Toweiti water dhow held up near Cusbah in Shatt-el-Arab by Persian river police patrol on or about 23rd August, 1933; crew beaten and robbed; Persian Raiz-i-Amnich took prompt proceedings against two of culprits; Tehran Legation is therefore being instructed to ask for punishment of guilty and return of stolen goods but not to demand compensation (P.Z. 7022/33). Jollyboat belonging to Trucial Oman boarded on 10th September, 1933, and subjected to search lasting for half an hour by Persian warship 'BABE' which steamed off on approach of H.M.S.

Mr. Mallet has now addressed a strong protest to the Persian Govt, and requested the payment of Iis.400 as compensation for the damage done to the dhow (P.Z.5417/33). His note is apparently 'based on a further report from «► * the Political Resident which has not yet been received here, and it will be noted that he has demanded compensation amounting to double the estimate given by the P.A., Koweit of the damage done.

On the other hand this incident taken together with the other similar cases which have recently occurred of interference with Arab shipping by the new Persian navy, does seem very considerably to strengthen our case for urging a conclusion of some agreement with the Persians by which the latter should definitely undertake not to interfere with local shipping not flying the Persian flag.
