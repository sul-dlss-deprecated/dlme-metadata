The most luxurious of these wares contained luster, added to the surface in a second firing and creating a metallic sheen that complemented mystical texts and images. While the image on this dish does not appear to be narrative, the presence of a bird, a familiar theme in Persian mystical literature, and human features asso- ciated with light (such as the moon-shaped faces) set the tone for the mystical verses appearing in two bands around the rim and interior. The text includes poetry by Rumi&rsquo;s spiritual master, Shams al-Din Tabrizi (d. 1248), as well as verses believed to have been composed by the lesser-known Baba Afzal al-Din Kashani (d. 1213&ndash;14).<br />", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2009-08-03", "date_added": "2009-08-03 13:18:20", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 20, "name": "Arts of the Islamic World", "folder": "arts_of_the_islamic_world", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [], "related_items": [], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 5172, "name": "Iran", "type": "Place made"}, {"id": 9262, "name": "Kashan, Iran", "type": "Possible place made"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "86.227.16_top_PS2.jpg", "id": 14002, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/86.227.16_top_PS2.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/86.227.16_top_PS2.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 96, "height": 72}, {"size": "1", "width": 192, "height": 145}, {"size": "2", "width": 384, "height": 290}, {"size": "3", "width": 768, "height": 580}, {"size": "4", "width": 1536, "height": 1161}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/86.227.16_top_PS2.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": " <em>Bowl of Reflections</em>, early 13th century.
