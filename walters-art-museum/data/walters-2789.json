Displayed on one side of this limestone plaque, in raised relief, is a kneeling king holding a wine jar in his hands. This carefully executed figure most likely served as a model for students. The plaque was cut from a larger piece which also originally served for training purposes. Three finished and two unfinished ears have been preserved, as well as a part of another ear, cut in half when the plaque was made smaller. Above the ears the beak of a vulture has also been preserved.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1914", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/20765", "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1914, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest. \r\n", "Dynasty": "Ptolemaic Dynasty", "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:39.157", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.285_SideB_SL_X75.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.285_SideB_SL_X75.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.285_SideB_SL_X75.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.285_SideB_SL_X75.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.285_SideB_SL_X75.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "2176", "Images": "PL2_22.285_Fnt_BW.jpg, PL9_22.285_SideB_SL_X75.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
