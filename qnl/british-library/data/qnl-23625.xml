Riffat Pasha said he had no knowledge of the matter, but he thought it would be better not to raise any con tentious questions in those regions at present, as it might give rise to an outcry against the Government similar to that raised in connection with the hyrch 'affaire' in a neighbouring part of the Empire. I observed that Bahrein and Mesopotamia were scarcely contiguous, and said that it would be open to the Turkish Government in agreeing to the proposed service to make stipulations that the status quo should not be considered as affected thereby and I ex pressed the h&lt;bpe that the Porte would not stand in the way of the development of the commercial relations of Bahrein with the Ottoman Empire.

(&amp;) to ore vent tne post office from competing with tne legitimate business of tne mail agents and (b) to lessen the risk of large remittances from Bahrein to the Head Office at Bushire. 3. As the persons named are, by the terms of their service, precluded from trading and only make small remittances, according to th^ir means, for bonafide private requiremen+s, the reason (a) can hardly be adduced against them, while as regards (b) if tne recent proposal to allow the Political Agent to draw on the post office at Bahrein for his office expenses is approved the risk will be automatically reduced. 4.

From Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Loch,I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain, To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf B U S H I R B Sir, I have the honour to enclose a copy of the letter No,G,M,37 dated the 26th January 1934 from the Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Sind and Baluchistan Circle, Karachi, asking if there is any objection to reducing the commission from Rs,2/- to Re.l/- on each one hundred rupees on money orders issued from the Bahrain Post Office to the public. 2. The reasons for charging the higher rate mentioned in Major Trevor’s letter No.501 dated the 20th February 1910 no longer hold good. 3. The present position isi~ (i) that the Eastern Bank at Bahrain issue drafts at 1 rates which vary according to the Season (in connection with the pearl trade). IVhen the Bank requires cash, drafts are issued at par and when cash is not required, a charge of Rs.7/- on every Rs. 1,000/- is levied* (ii) that the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited, charge Rs.5/- on every Rs. 1,000/- on specie sent to India by steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company. (iii) that the Post Office at present charges Rs.20/- per fc.1,000/- 2 - Rs«l f OOO/- on money orders. 4. From the political point of view I see no objection to the proposed reduction, but it seems probable that, in spite of other means of transmitting money to India, the Post Office will find that the reduced charge for money orders will result in their having considerable accumulations of cash just at the time when it cannot be remitted to India except on payment of the charge for drafts. 5. The Postal Authorities from time to time ask me to absorb their cash balances, and, though I finance the Agency largely from thao source, I cannot take up all their accumulations of cash. I am not, therefore, clear as to the object of introducing a change, which will be likely to result in still greater accumulation of cash. 6. Possibly, however, the Post Office hope to encourage the public to use more money orders (as they are a quick and convenient way of remitting small sums of money) at 1%, and i themselves to remit in large sums through the Bank at .7% or through the British India Steam Navigation Company at .5%. 7. I would suggest that, if you see no objection to his proposal, a copy of this letter may be sent to the Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Karachi.
