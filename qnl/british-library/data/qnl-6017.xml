I translated your letter about 7PEKD to His High ness who had admitted his misdemeanours and said that State finances were responsibility of Abdullah Salim who had entrusted them to YAHAD and should control him. He said he would take it up with Abdullah Salim. 3. He continued emphatically that the State finances would never be properly run until he had a British Financial adviser. I remarked that it was well for Arabs to run their own affairs as far as experience permitted but conceded that a lot of experience would be required as soon as the Oil Company started large scale operations. 4. His Highness concluded by saying that he had no one among his family or subjects who was fit to handle the finances once the Oil Company re-started development. !

Shaikh Abdulla Salim intends visiting Syria for Hamaihan. Do you wish ne to protest to Shaikh should he appoint Tahad as Salim to act for his brother? pahad was rempvecl at instance of Political Resident who sent a personal V letter to Shaiwh last SepterrS er. Correspondence resting with my telegram Mo.633. refers. ' n s l: - POLITICAL - ICONFIDENTIAL THE POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT. No.C/567 ftated the 4th June, 1946 Subject:- Adviser for Kuwait. Dear Colonel Hay, Please refer to my telegram No.686 dated the 25th July, 1945. As the same question will almost certainly arise this summer I think: I should let you know what happened last year. 2 . I mentioned the matter to His Highness who told me that he would personally supervise the Revenue and Supply Departments in ^ Shaikh Abdulla Salim’s absence. If he did so at all, his super vision must have been purely nominal and Fahed as Salim did in fact step into his brother’s shoes. I even received a letter (which I ignored) from Fahad on the Supply Department’s business. However, Abdulla Salim re-assumed his post on his return and Fahad as Salim has since been officially unemployed, although I believe he interest himself to a certain extent in the worx. 3. I fancy that the position this year is different. Fahad as Salim, I hear, is keen to regain his position; Abdulla Salim’s health appears to be failing; and it is unlikely that he will oust Fahad should the latter be allowed to officiate. If a change is avoided this year I am afraid it will only be a postponement, for Fahad is much younger and more energetic, and intelligent and ambitious into the bargain. He is also ficmle and is easily Shaikh party makes him, in my view, an unsuitable person to take ov over a post of such importance. If he is once allowed to take it over, it will probably be exceedingly difficult to have him removed again unless we can point to some grave misdemeanour. V swayed, and this, together with his association with the anti- /3. By local The Hon’ble Lt-Colonel W.R. Hay, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Camp, BAHRAIN .4. By local custom the senior posts in the administration are only held by the 'Al-Subah, TT and the Revenue Department has become the perquisite of the M Aulad Salim rt . If Abdulla Salim is allowed to relinquish his post there is no member of the ’ f Aulad Salim ,, , of the M Al-Subah ft for that matter, with the necessary qualifications and capabilities to replace him except Fahad as Salim. I should like your permission, therefore, to impress on His Highness the desirability of retaining the services of Abdulla Salim until an outsider can be foupd to fill his place. 5. From next month the Revenue Department will be receiving some Rs.400,000/- monthly as oil royalties and the necessity of proper finance and budgetting will become more than ever necessary, and I am sure that His Highness would agree that the duties are beyond the capacity of any member of his family. * At the same time he has not the courage to incur the odium of appointing a foreign adviser on his own initiative, and would much rather it were done in such a way that he could explain to the 'Aulad Salim” that it was due to British pressure. It is my opinion that we should taxe the initiative in having an adviser appointed. 6. The objections to the appointment of a British Adviser seem to be:- (a) A man with a considerable Knowledge of finance would be required.. The Kuwaitis are astute; and it would be damaging to our prestige if the man appointed at our instance were not a real expert. (b) He would have to know spoken and written Arabic. (c) He would have to be prepared to live more or less in Arab style as no European accommodation is available. This would probably confine the choice to a bachelor. (d) The appointment of a British Adviser would be likely to be seized upon by the press of Iraq ansi other Arab countries as an act of veiled imperialism. Under the circumstances I think that our interests, and those of PCuwait, would best be served by the appointment of an Egyptian or Syrian provided we could find one who was truly pro-British as well as having the other qualifications required. Should he not be /satisfactory....&amp; satisfactory it would be easier, at the end of his contract, to appoint a British Adviser in his place than it would be to insert one ab initio . 7. If you agree I will impress on His Highness the importance of not allowing Fahad as Salim to obtain control of the Revenue Department and will obtain his reactions to the idea of an Egyptian V oi* Syrian Financial Adviser. Should Abdulla Salim's health continue to fail the matter will become one of some urgency. Yours sincerely, -1 LES.
