Articles II and III of the Law allow the persons falling under (b) and (c) to divest themselves of Persian nationality and to adopt the nationality of their fathers within one year after attaining the age of 18, subject to the fulfilment of two conditions, namely, first, that th^ir fathers' Govern merit recognizes them as their own subjects, and secondly that the law in the territories of their fathers 1 Government allows the children born of Persian subjects to resume Persian nationality without special permission of the v « State concerned^ 3, Ail Act supplementary to the 1929 Law was passed on the 21st October 193C and Article 1 thereof allowed pex-sons coming under (b'; and (_c) and who were over the age of 18 at, the time of the enforcement of the 1939 Lav; to exercise the privilege of divesting themselves of Persian nationality provided under Article II of thu 1929 Law, within one year from the date of passing of the Supplementary Act, In Article 2 of this Act it was explained that in ordur that persons coding under (c) might be regarded as Persian subjects theyt- \ they should have resided in Persia at least one more year immediately after attaining the age of 18. In this connection it should be borne in mind that where the mother is Persian, a child born in Persia is considered to be a Persian subject under (b) of Article 1 of the Lav/ of 1929, even though the child did not reside in Persia between his -*-8 th and _L9th birthdays. 4. it is now understood that the Persian Government will be prepared to entertain sympathetically for a short period applications from persons of British nationali ty who had passed the age of 18 before the Law of September i7th 1929 entered into fore- and who omitted to exercise right of option before 21st October 19^1, One of the conditions on which release from Persian nationality is granted to persons who failed to opt within the time limit prescribed in the Persian Law of 1930 is that pur sons concerned shall give an undertaking that within one year from the date of relinquishing their Persian nationality they will transfer to Persian subjects the rights in respect of immovable property which they possess in Persia or which they may in future obtain by inheritance^ even if Persian Laws permit ,their-possession by foreign subjects.
