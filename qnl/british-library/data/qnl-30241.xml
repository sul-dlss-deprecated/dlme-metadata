No substantive promotion (except to the rank of Jemadar) is now permissible in the Indian Array and consequently Subedar Allah Dad cannot be granted substantive promotion to the rank of Subedar Major in the Indian Army on the gr^ound that had he been with his Regiment he would have received promotion to this rank.

In the circumstances, it is not permissible to grant Subedar Allah Dad promotion to acting or war substantive rank of Subedar Major against the establishment of his Indian Army Unit. t 3.
