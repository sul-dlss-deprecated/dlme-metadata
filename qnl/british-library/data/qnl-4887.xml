In England, 'fciles and Scotland, a pensioner receives a personal summons by post, and if he ioins within three days inclusive from the date of ^ost, and if he joins within throe days posting that summons, he is credited with pay from date of posting the summons. If he arrives at his Depot after the thirc day he receives pay from the date of arrival only).14, Sufficient money to meet the expenses in connection ^ith these ratings(paragrarhs 10 and 11) 77ill be placed at the disposal of the officers concerned on application by them t 0 the local civil accounts officers concerned.

(c) It is of course possible that His Majesty might issue instructions for'the calling out of rIa TT al Reserves and that the crisis which called for such action might then subside without war supervening. In that case, if it is decided that the Admiralty Order R,V,53C should be withdrawn, the officers will receive a telegram in the XX f AND 7HEREAS by the first section of the Naval Reserve (mobilisation) Act, 1900, amending the said ^ct of 1859, it is enacted that it shall be lawful for the Kins;, T7hero His Majesty orders and directs that Volunteers under the said Act of 1850 shall be called into actual services, to authorise the Admiralty to give and, when given, to revoke or vary such directions as may seem necessary or proper for calling out all or any of the said Volunteers • as the occasion may require: AND 7HEl'vEAS The Kin/?: has communicated to xarliament (or so declared in Council) and notified by Freclamation that owine: to the State of Public Affairs and tne demands upon His Naval Forces fnr the protection of the Smprre ? an occasion has arisen for ordering and directing: as in the first-mentioned Act is provided: It is hereby notified The Kinec has ordered and directed that Volunteers under the said Act shall be called into actual service and has authorised the Lords Commissioners of 'kksx the Admiralty to give, and when given to revoke or vary, such directions as may seem necessary or proper for calling out ^ all or any of the said Volunteers as the occasion may require.
