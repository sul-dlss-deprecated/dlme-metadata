The rightmost figure is preserved from the hips upwards; the figure on the left is missing below the shoulders. Both hold trays supporting was-sign, hes-vases and lost blossoms (only partially preserved) and from which descend lines (which probably terminated in ankh signs). The first figure is labeled sn-wr and the second is km-wr. These refer to bodies of water, whether \"ocean\u201d/ \u201cbitter lakes\" or \u201cback swamps\" (km-wr) or mythical bodies.\r\nA pt (\u201cheaven\u201d) is partially preserved at the top. An inscription was once above. Traces of a seated god, the shen sign, and the djet (\u201ceternity\u201d) sign appear. These are framed on the left by a column of three signs (ankh, djed, was).\r\n\r\nHieroglyphs and offerings retain some of their original paste inlay, now white. Pieced together from five large fragments and some smaller chips. The figures preserve small traces of blue (beards and wigs) and re (skin) pigments. The second figure is missing his nose, mouth, and chin. Numerous small chips and scratches. Surface of white limestone now a dirty grey with darker discoloration.", "medium": "Limestone, pigment, paste", "dimensions": "21 5/8 x 24 x 2 3/4 in.
