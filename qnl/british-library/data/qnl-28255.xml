In class ( 11 ) there are on the staff of His Majesty’s Legation three Biitish Indian sowars and one other British subject, a Hazara ferash. The amount of income-tax payable by these men is extremely small, since the rate is only 1 per cent, on incomes under Rials 5,000 per annum. The ferash for instance would pay only Rials 29 (7/Qd.) per annum, and the sowais about Rials 40 (10). With regard to the private servants of His Majesty s Minister, I understand that Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was not sanguine about the chances of obtaining exemption for them In the circumstances you may consider that it is scarcely worth while to press tor exemption for the official servants and other persons affected. I should be grateful for your instructions on this point. 5.

With reference to the instructions contained in Foreign Office Circular W.-4907/293/50 of June 1 st, 1934, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a report on economic developments in Iran during the first six months of the year 1936. In the light of Mr- Ashton-Gwatkin 5 s semi official letter of June 3rd (W.-2577/92/5), it is not proposed to send a fur ther economic report of this nature during the current year apart from that which will be contained in the Annual Report from this Legation. I would add to the present report certain comments on its foreign and internal aspects. 2. The confusion referred to as caused to foreign trade by the Exchange Control Act does not seem as yet to have made business houses of the bigger and wealthier countries shy of concession hunting; only the other day an adjudication of Government orders for broadcasting outfits found British, German and Italian firms competing, but the smaller countries seem to be drawing in their horns. The Danish Charge d’Affaires has advised his Govt, to contract no more commitments nor risk Danish funds being frozen here, and it is significant that the ground on which the Swedish Govern ment are dissatisfied with their new draft compensation agreement is that it fails to give them sufficient security. The Kampsax Consortium too are believed to be keen to finish their big work here, get their money and go while the going is good. 3. The Shah’s dislike of a large adverse balance of trade with any country has no doubt some roots in politics. It is his aversion from com mitting himself too deeply to any one country that leads him to spread out widely his orders for goods from abroad; and Monsieur Oveicy’s mission to Eastern cuntries suggests a desire to find yet further markets. 4 . At home there seems undoubtedly a tendency to develop certain areas intensively, e.g., Tehran, Mazanderan and apparently now Khuzistan. At the same time other areas, though less favoured, are not entirely neglected. Head construction is spread widely over the whole country (though the motive here is probably military), considerable encouragement is being given to the peasantry in all suitable localities to cultivate opium, and factories and companies are springing up even in towns of minor importance. In the Isfahan area all this development seems to have been brought about by private enterprise, but in other areas it is nearly always State-fostered, and it is very doubtful how far it benefits local merchants. 5. It is difficult to provide figures as to the rising cost of living, but complaints arising from it are very general. The peasants can afford no suu-ar and very little tea but as cultivators of the soil they can always live as long as their crops do not fail them. The poorer classes in the towns are those most hardly hit by the Shah’s reforms and economic policy. For many, falling into debt must be inevitable, and it can hardly be doubted that*social discontent must be widely engendered. The facts that the Shah alone has policies and drives them through increases his prestige and strength politically, but this political predominance is apt to interfere m •business and in the long run the effect cannot be beneficial. His interven tion in the exchange rate is a good illustration. When this came to be fixed last March, the Minister of Finance is believed to have made out his draft118 arrangements with the rate at Rials 85 to one pound sterling. The Shah struck this out and substituted 80. 6 . Indeed when the Shah orders a railway, a harbour or a factory, one has the feeling that he does so not because the estimates of experts show that it will be profitable, but simply because he feels that every respected country has a railway, etc., and because it gives him an inferiority com plex not to possess one also. 7.

Enclo. to S. No. (64). Economic Report for Iran, January to May 1936. Economic conditions in Iran during the first five months of the cur rent year have been dominated by the exchange control regulations intro duced on March 1 st, and by the new Customs tariff anticipated towards the end of May as a result of the denunciation of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty of May 10 th, 1928, and of all other treaties restricting Iran's autho rity to modify her Customs tariff. Exchange Control. Increasing stringency of foreign exchange during 1935 became more marked in the latter months of the year, when the Banque Mellie practi cally coased selling exchange. As a result, the rate moved sharply up wards from about eighty-six rials to the pound in September to one hundred in the middle of February, and remained at that rate or slightly below until the end of that month. By the exchange control law of March 1st the purchase, sale, transfer and export of foreign exchange was prohibited unless authorized by an Exchange Commission created by the Government. The Banque Mellie and the Imperial Bank were authorized to effect exchange transactions in accord ance with the terms of the Act and with the rules laid down by the Ex change Commission. The exchange control was not to apply exports to countries with which Iran had trade agreements providing for balanced imports and exports, e.g., the Soviet Union and Germany, nor to the exports of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and of the Caspian Fisheries combine; exports of specinc goods effected against sale of certain goods to Iranian Government or Municipal authorities were also excepted. Exporters of goods from Iran were to deposit at one of the authorized banks within three days of receipt and not less than three months from shipment the foreign exchange resulting from their operations, V lus ten per cent, estimated as average profit. Severe penalties were imposed for contraventions of the •** to a- P“' d H™* . As was to be expected, the passage of the Act caused the greatest con- iision in all foreign trade transactions, as well as innumerable difficulties to individuals needmg exchange for travelling, remittance of part of their abroad 3 etc^TheC^'* f P Sur f ce or educational charges incurred abroad, etc The excessively sharp transition from a rate of one hundred to the pound to one of eighty, together with the necessity of deposftW aH foreign exchange proceeds of exnorfq h™rio-R+ fE ,y ^ ^ uepositmg ail still prevailed at the end of May and were ^ ^ A T 11680 cond itions lication of the new Customs tariff M ~ ^ by - the deIay in P ub ' 21 st. was passed by the Majlis on May119 In spite of the severe penalties announced for infraction of v change Control Act, it is reported that a secret black bourse is alread^ operating in the Bazaar where rates vary between 100 and 110 rials to the pound. It would indeed be strange if this were not the case since so manv people with ample funds in rials are unable to obtain urgently needed foreign exchange for their trading or private needs. In filghdld where he control naturally does not operate, the exchange rate is similar JS prevailing on the black bourse in Tehran. There is a strong conviction, not to say hope that as the trade of the country is increasinglv crippled and the shortage of exchange becomes even more marked, the Government will be obliged to increase the rate in the near future to at least ninety rials in order to make export operations reasonably profitable According to reports from His Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorassan Indian traders in East Iran are seriously perturbed by the new exchange re gulations together with the monopoly legislation which is closing most of the normal avenues of trade. They are now not only unable to remit to India the profits, if any, realized on their transactions, but are unable to obtain foreign currency to remit to their families abroad for normal main tenance or educational purposes. Even if they decide to suspend operations in Iran and return to India there is no guarantee that they would be able to obtain rupees from the sale of their businesses. Their activities range over such a wide field, from tailoring or laundry business to the motor trade or import and export transactions, that it is 'extremely difficult to devise any remedy for their plight. There is no evidence to show that the ex change control and monopoly restrictions are being deliberately used by the Iranian Government to discriminate against foreign traders, and it is therefore not possible to intervene on behalf of the Indian traders on these grounds. New Customs Tariff. The new Customs tariff approved on May 21 st, has not yet been publish ed officially, but unofficial versions in Persian have been issued by two Tehran newspapers, and from one of these a provisional translation has been prepared by His Majesty’s Legation. The principal change is that the new rates are specific in respect of most imports, instead of ad valorem. The taxes will be levied in ordinary rials at the normal rates of exchange instead of in fictitious “gold” rials with a surtax of 160 per cent, on the published rates. It is not yet known whether the obligation to purchase foreign exchange at fictitious rates which was formerly obligatory in respect of certain imports will disappear, but the new duties will not supersede the road tax previously charged on most imports, which is in many cases more onerous than the Customs duties themselves. In addition to Customs duties and road tax, imports (except those from countries with clearing agree ments) will still be saddled with the charge of 17J per cent, in respect of import licence, as well as certain monopoly taxes as in the case of cotton piece goods. The new duties as a whole are much higher than those previously in force, with the exception of some low-priced articles of prime necessity and wide consumption, e.g., sugar, tea, lower grade piece goods. In the case of certain “luxury” articles, in which class apparently private motor cars are included, the duties will be much higher with the object of reducing imports and of further stimulating internal industrial development. The bill in troducing the new duties provides powers for the increase of duties on part of or all imports from countries whose Customs tariffs or other measures are considered to be prejudicial to Iran’s export trade. It was stated in the Majlis in the course of the debate that agricultural and industrial maeki- nerv will continue to be exempt from Customs duties, 43?(C) F&amp;PDBudget for 1936-1937, The budget estimates for the financial year 1936-7, approved in March, provided for revenue and expenditure of approximately 1 , 000 , 000,000 rials, being an increase of approximately one-third on the estimates for the pre ceding year. As no returns of actual revenue and expenditure during a given year are ever published, the interest in the official figures can only be partial. Provision is made in the budget for the expenditure of 150 million rials on railway construction, this being only a part of the esti mated cost under this heading for the financial year. In the supplementary budget law a further sum of 150 million rials for railway construction is to be provided from the sugar and tea monopoly tax fund—the doubtful as sumption being made that the fund contains so^ large a sum—together with £ 1 , 000,000 sterling from reserve funds. The cost of railway construction and supplies for the year is thus estimated at three hundred million rials in currency, equivalent to £3,750,000 at the present rate of exchange, plus £ 1 , 000,000 from the sterling reserves held abroad- Further sterling sums to be obtained from the diminishing national reserve include £ 2 , 000,000 for military supplies and £80,000 on account of further payments for sugar factories. Currency. The expansion of the currency circulation continues, the figure being 698.933.450 rials on March 6 th as compared with 421,653,450 on March 21st, 1935. During the same period the total backing (gold and silver) decreased from 19T65 per cent, to 108-23 per cent. The increase in note circulation is bound to continue in order to provide for the capital of the new companies constantly being formed, and as His Imperial Majesty apparently insists on a minimum cover of one hundred per cent., orders are reported to have been placed ( Cf Setareh-ye-Djehane of February 12 th), for the purchase of a further quantity of gold bullion. These orders, if carried out, will of course add still more to the existing stringency of foreign ex change. With the present rates of exchange and the reduced price of silver there is little or no inducement for silver coins to be smuggled out of the country, but very few silver coins remain in circulation. m Monopoly Developments. The formation of new trading and industrial companies continues many of which the Government participates either directly or indirectly. Export monopolies have been constituted in respect of carpets, .iron, assa foetida, cotton, wool, skins, rice, etc., and import monopolies m respect of silk goods, alcoholic drinks, playing cards. At the present rate of progress all the main export commodities will be in the hands of monopoly concerns by the end of the year, and many categories of imports The sphere of activities of private traders—who naturally have less oppor tunities for obtaining foreign exchange than semi-Government concerns—is becoming more and more circumscribed, and the outlook for them is not promising.

The fire last year at the Customs warehouse at Khorramshahr fiVToham- merah) appears to have shelved for the time being the closing of the Customs depot at Ahwaz which had been planned. A scheme for the development of port works at Bandar Shahpur at a cost of over £ 1 , 000,000 has been held up for the present owing to lack of funds. German Clearing A greement. The effects of the German clearing agreement of November 1935 cannot oe appreciated until Customs returns for recent months are available In view of the shortage of foreign exchange there is a danger that goods which would otherwise be imported from other countries, including the United Kingdom, may now be obtained from Germany. There is of course a defi nite limit to the capacity of the German market for absorbing Iranian floods, as well as to the quantities of such goods available for export, and this^ toge ther with the sensitivity of the Iranian Government to large adverse balances with any country should check any abnormal increase in German imports There is already apparent an attempt on the part of Iran to divert products to and obtain imports from other countries, and the impres sion is being formed that the agreement with Germany is not working very satisfactorily. Iran s needs for the near future of railway rolling stock and industry and military supplies are far too large to be satisfied within the limits of a clearing scheme with Germany based on balanced trade; it is indeed doubtful whether she will be able to effect them at all without tapping some as yet undisclosed source of foreign exchange, either in the form of a loan or of credits. _ Representations made by His Majesty’s Legation against the discrimi nation in Germany’s favour provided by Article XVII of the clearing agree ment, which abolished export certificates and import licences in respect of trade with Germany under the Agreement, elecited the expected reply from the Iranian Government that similar treatment would be forthcoming for British trade if a clearing agreement with Iran were negotiated. Transport and Communications. Steady progress is being made in the construction of the North-South railway. Rials have been laid as far as Firouz Kuh, at kilometre 257 on the Northern section, and in the South service trains are running up to Kala Sheikh at kilometre 307, Motor transport on the whole is finding more employment probably as the result of industrial development with its concomitant of transport of machinery from the ports to sites of new factories, of raw materials to the factories and of finished goods to market. A partial setback was experi enced with the opening of the new Anglo-Iranian oil refinery at Kerman- shah, as oil products are no longer carried from the Southern oilfields to North Iran, and part of the Kermanshah output is transported in specially constructed tank lorries imported by the Company from the United Kingdom. The civil air service projected between Tehran and Baghdad and Bnshire has not yet been inaugurated; it is understood that a hitch has occur red owing to the unwillingness of the Iraq Government to grant permission for the flights to Baghdad without a quid pro quo. Cost of Living. There is a steady increase in the cost of most imported commodities, due in part to the progressive monopolization of foreign trade, exchangecontrol and the shortage of foreign currencies, and to the uncertainty re garding the effect of the new customs tariffs which came into force on May 22nd, but full details of which are not yet available. The disappearance 01 the chaddur and the obligation to wear European dress has of course added considerably to the cost of living of all sections of the population, and has undoubtedly created some hardship among the poorer classes. Japanese Competition. Trade statistics are not available to show whether the ground lost by the Japanese to Soviet imports, mainly cotton piece goods, ^ bem g regained to any extent. That Japanese initiative is being maintained, however, and is not confined to cotton goods, is shown by their securing an important order for dvnamite for the Iranian Government at a price understood to be about 15 per cent, below that of a British competitor. From another source not vet confirmed, it is understood that the Japanese have recently conclud ed an agreement to take up 800 chests of opium against imports of cotton goods of double the amount (this would mean imports of cotton goods to the value of about £150,000). It is further understood that the Japanese have reserved an option to take up a further 1,000 chests of opium against fur ther imports into Iran of cotton goods, etc., up to three times the value of the additional opium exports. This would suggest that the policy of restrict ing exchange for imports from each particular country to the amount realis ed from exports to that country is not being followed in respect of Japan, but the desperate desire of the Iranians to sell some of their surplus opium stocks is well known. What use the Japanese will make of these large opium purchases is outside the subject matter of the present memorandum, but presumably they will be introduced, openly or surreptitiously, into Manchuria and Northern China. (65) Fetter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, to the Foreign Offige, London, No- 453/3/36, dated the 29th June 1936. You will, I think, be interested to hear of the following changes in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs— (1) Motamedy leaves our section to become head of the section dealing with inter alia Iraq, Afghanistan and Egypt. (2) Ansari, head of the Economics section, replaces Motamedy. He was away from here about eight months last year and this with the Iranian Economic mission to German, and since his return has not gone out at all as his wife has died. People find him amiable but he is thought to be rather a snake; (3) Nuri Esfiandiary becomes Chef de Protocole, vice Ferouhar who goes to another department; an enormous improvement. (4) a certain Ameri, lately of the Ministry of Justice, is taking over Nuri’s old job which, as you know, include the Shatt-el-Arab negotiations. He was a member of the late delegation in Baghdad and is a jovial creature—otherwise we know little about him. 2 .

Sir, Mr. Butler to Mr. Eden.—{Received April 27). Tehran, March 28, 1936. In the annual report for 1935 a reference was made to Turkey as hav ing retained her position as Iran’s best friend, and in his despatch No. 33 of the 18th January last His Majesty’s Minister reported the arrangement for the direct exchange of news by wireless between the Pars and Anatolian Agencies as a link in the rapproachement between the two countries. 2 . I now have the honour to report certain respects in which the Turkish Embassy here seems specially favoured and which may conveniently be considered under three heads, military, diplomatic and court. 3. As regards military affairs, you are doubtless aware that the mili tary attaches here (comprising the British, French, Russian, Japanese and Turkish) have not for many years been invited to attend any parades (other than the military review on the anniversary of the coup d'etat) or to attend military functions of any description. 4. It seems to be a fact, however, that the Turkish military attache was singled out for an invitation to attend the army manoeuvres which were held near Tehran in November last, and that he was expressly asked by His Imperial Majesty the Shah to criticise the operations. Captain Orge apparently pointed out some errors in the tactical handling of the artillery and the Shah ordered that his criticisms and advice should be cir culated throughout the army for its future guidance. Major Pybus, to whom I am indebted for this information, is of opinion that his Turkish colleague was a brave officer, firstly in taking the Shah at his word and secondly, as a mere infantry officer, in presuming to teach a gunner his trade. Some time ago, too, His Britannic Majesty’s consul in Tabriz reported that several Turkish officers had attended the combined manoeuvres of the Eastern and Western Azerbaijan divisions which were held in October 1934. 5 . In diplomacy the Turks are well served by their Ambassador, Mehmet Enis Akaygen, who in contrast to his predecessor is conciliatory, suave and quick-witted. M. Enis was fortunate also in coming in on the crest of the wave at the time of the Shah’s visit to Turkey, when a general air of friendliness between the two nations prevailed. It must, in part, be due to his skill that to-day this friendly feeling between the two heads of States appears to be no whit the less. At the recent No Ruz Salaam, M. Enis was the only diplomat whom the Shah seemed to me to regard with anv pleasure. He is well supported by his counsellor, M. Refet, and the rest of his staff. 6 . In court circles, too, the Turkish Embassy has gained a footing where others have not. For the past year Mme. Enis and her two young and vivacious daughters have been constant visitors at the palace, where, on an average of once a week, they take tea with the Queen and with the two elder princesses. 438(C) f&amp;pdFfcca-'iS 124 7 It is noteworthy also that when a deadlock appeared to have) been reached in January in the negotiations at Bagdad the ®° ve , , seemed to have conceived that appeal to the Shah could best be d e g Angora and the Turkish Ambassador in Iran. And it will be remembered that alter Persia had defined her own frontier with Turkey, the Persian and Afghan Governments invited a Turkish general to preside over he arbitral commission to fix the Perso-Afghan frontier, and that the lurk discharged this duty with success. 8 . The reason underlying the Turco-Iranian rapproachement is no doubt to be found not merely in contiguity of territory or a common faith, but largely in the Shah’s conviction that Turkey and Iran are wayfarers on the same road of progress towards westernisation. Both have included m their programmes dress reform, language reform, the destruction of the power o the clergy, the substitution of a national spirit for a national religion, apart from increase in armaments, and improvement of communications which, of course, are in no sense peculiar to these two countries. Nevertheless, to call the Iranian method a mere slavish imitation of the Turkish would, I believe, be less than the truth. I prefer to think that the Shah regards Turkey as a kind of pilot engine and hopes that, should there be a bomb on the line to westernisation, the sight of Atatiirk ascending skywards might enable Reza Shah to apply his brakes in time. 9. In the light of the above it is difficult to grudge Turkey the position of best friend. From this friendship the Shah may well hope, also to get some insurance against Turkey’s ally, Soviet Russia, and even to exert greater influence on Iraq. Against this friendship between the heads of the two States must be set the age-long hostility between the two countries and the intense resentment felt in many parts of Iran, notably round Tabriz, against Turkey as an ineradically barbarous State responsible for the un wanted changes now being forced upon a far more civilised country. 10 . I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Angora. I have, etc. NEVILE BUTLER, (67) Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. C. A. -74, dated the 10th July 1936. A German 3-engined Junkers commercial aeroplane arrived in Tehran on June 30th and left for Afghanistan after a week’s stay. The local press reported that the object of the visit was the study of meteorological conditions. 2 . The Japanese Minister told Simmonds that he thought the German plane was studying conditions for an eventual service between Berlin and Urumchi via, Ankara, Baghdad, Tehran and Kabul. At Urumchi con nection would be made with a further service to Shanghai. He said the Germans had been granted by the Chinese Government the concession for an air service from Europe to China, but the Soviets had refused to allow the German service to operate over Soviet territory. The proposed route was interesting from a political and propaganda viewpoint, but was unlikely to be remunerative. 3. Pybus has heard a similar story from the French Military Attach^ so there may be something in it. Walker agrees too that the Germans are pro bably wanting to run an air service through here and that the present trip is in the nature of a meteorological survey; but he has no information as to the proposed route after Kabul.125 4. Whether the Germans have obtained permission to operate across Iran, and to what extent the proposed service would compete with the projected Iranian civil air service to Baghdad, are questions which we can not yet answer. 5.

Sir, Mr. Butler was good enough to send me a copy of his despatch No. 151 of the 28th March [S. No. ( 66 )] on the subject of relations between Turkey and Iran. 2 . The facilities givep to the Turkish military attache in Tehran are probably in the nature of a return for the similar and very wide facilities given to the Shah during his State visit to Turkey in 1934, and to which attention was drawn by my despatch No. 329 of the 7th July, 1934 (F. No. 341-N./34). 3. I share Mr. Butler’s opinion that we have no reason to grudge Turkey the position she has won for herself in Iran. The removal, for the time being at all events, of the ancient grievances that caused so much ill-feeling between the two neighbouring countries in former days seems to me a definite asset for peace in this part of Asia and thenceforth an asset for British policy. There are no grounds here for supposing that Turkey has abused the position she has gained in Iran, and there appear from Mr. Butler’s despatch to be none perceptible in Tehran, where they would pre sumably be more noticeable. On the other hand there is evidence that Turkish influence in Iran has been used in a moderating and conciliatory sense, especially as regards Irano-Iraqi relations and difficulties, and that Turkey has held in careful regard and respect British interests in those regions. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Imperial Government present their compliments to His Britannic Majesty’s Legation and have the honpur to state that with a view to simplifying references, isolating and centralis ing Consular affairs a department has lately been formed in this Ministry known as “D^partement Consulaire”. The said Department will be in charge of the duties which used to be dealt with by the Department of Passports, Nationality and Civil Status as well as those which were en trusted to the Economics Department in addition to the affairs relating to aviators and international sanitation and the affairs relating to personal status of Iranian subjects abroad and foreign subjects in Iran which were all dealt with in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The “Departement Consulate” will have the following four sections: “Daereh-i-Sabt-i-Ahval (Civil Status section). “Daereh-i-Gozar nameh va Tabeiyyat” (Passport and Nationality section). “Daereh-i-Ahval-i-Shakhsieh va omour-i-Ghazai” (Personal status and judicial affairs section). “Daereh-i-Eghtessad” (Economics section). Thus the departments of Economics and Passports, Nationality and Civil Status have been closed down and all Consular affairs will have to be refer red to the “Department Consulaire”. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now introducing His Excellency Monsieur Yadellah Azodi as Head of the “Departement Consulaire”. (Sealed) Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Sub-Enel. to S. No. (72). A brief Survey of Economic Conditions in East Iran. The formation of Companies holding Monopolies for all the principal commodities of Import and Export could not fail to rapidly eliminate the private trader. Still there remained a few lines of Commerce open to the small trader, and had it not been for the sudden imposition of the restrictions on the sale and purchase of Foreign Exchange, the individual trader might have struggled on for some time. The irksome formalities attached to dealings in Exchange constituted the blow which should have put the small trader quite out of the market, but there remains still a loophole, although it is a rapidly narrowing slit. The way of escape for the petty trader is afforded by the Irano-German Trade Agreement, since goods can be imported from Germany without the necessity of complying with all the complicated regulations which apply to the Import of goods from other sources. Even so, the outlook for the small trader is obscure, for no sooner is it discovered that some article offers scope for remunerative trade, than it is at once made the object of a monopoly granted to a single Company, financ ed directly or indirectly by Government. To the partly suppressed means of the private trader the Official reply has been, “Invest in the Monopoly Companies which will operate on a grand scale and secure to you profits hitherto undreamt of by you”. But the fly has become wary, and no longer enters the Government spider’s parlour with readiness. Very few traders in East Iran have subscribed to the funds of the Monopoly Companies or they have given purely nominal sums, under pressure. They do not trust this new venture of trade on a grand scale, and fear that either there will be no profits, or that they will adhere to the palms of the many hands,—Directors, Agents, sub-Agents, etc., etc., who will pick the bone before it is thrown to the ordinary share holder. J Nevertheless somehow, and from somewhere, a good deal of money seems to have been squeezed out of the public to provide capital for the Monopoly Companies, but it is not the trading class in East Iran which has subscribed most—pressure was brought to bear on land-owners, etc., who still had a little money to invest. It has been pointed out that if the money alleged to have been sub- senbed by the National Bank or Agricultural Bank—on behalf o the Government is really there, quite a stupendous sum must&amp; „ A+ the Governments most owners would be the first to suffe . ^ constructed sugar factory, spectacular effort at the moment is the ^wly °onst s the Large areas of land have been devoted to to a great extent factory—unfortunately disease has W d be GOnsideI .^ d to be more than a failure.

Since the trial and sentence of Reza Afshar, reported in my despatch No. 302 of the 13th June last (S. No. 58), the public interest in the Road Ministry scandals has been kept alive by the publication in the press of detailed statements of the accusations prepared against the various pri- sioners, beginning with the most important of them, Ali Monsour. (It may be remarked here that the “Journal de Teheran” called him “M. Ali Mansour” on the 8 th July). The advocates chosen by the accused were also announc ed. Finally, the trial of the e^-Minister was fixed for Saturday, the 1 st August. 2 . The proceedings of the trial were reported in the press at great length. Speeches appear to have been reproduced verbatim; and the sudden end of the trial on the 4th August put the Tehran press in some embarrass ment; they reproduced the findings of the court at once, but are still repro ducing the arguments of counsel, crowded out hitherto for reasons of space. Photographs of the venerable judges in their new robes adorned all the illus trated papers. 3. There were three main counts in the accusation. The first con cerned the sum of Rials 150,000 alleged to have been paid as a bribe to Mansour by the Societe Sentab, through the agency of Ali Asghar Taleghani. The principal evidence in support of this charge was the statement of ^ a q e ' ghani himself. The second count stated that certain members of the Ministry had taken bribes from the Comyagnie Hollandaise m con nexion with the construction of the port of No Shahr a 1 nd .^f a N abavi had been instrumental in arranging that Rials 100,000 of these bribes reached the ^-Minister. The final count alleged that Mansour had caused the Treasury a loss of Rials 900,000 owing to the purchase of a dredger from the Soci4t&lt;5 Chichav, the lower tender of another company having been rejected. 4. The Court acquitted the accused on all three counts The written statement of acquittal says that the evidence « support of *e fi ret d second counts was insufficient; and that the Societe Chichav s otter was nor fced ' ,, • u- lonctw sneeches for the defence had started by 5.

With reference to my despatch No. 325 of the 25th June (S. No. 63), I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a despatch from the Acting British Consul at Ahwaz regarding the new floating dock which has now been anchored by the Iranian naval authorities at Bandar Shahpur. 2. I had delayed forwarding a copy of this despatch to your Depart ment in anticipation of Mr. Todd’s visit to Tehran which has just taken place, as I hoped that he might then be able to furnish more definite infor mation about the dock. It proved, however, that Mr. Todd was not able to add anything, and I felt therefore that I should forward this despatch without further delay, though I realise that it contains little definite infor mation. The difficulty of obtaining information from the Iranian naval and military authorities will be appreciated. It is, however, hoped that His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr will shortly be able to visit Bandar Shahpur. I will not fail to report any further information which I may receive on this subject. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India No. 208, to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad No. 68 , to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf No. 6 fi, to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz No. 51, to His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Khcrramshahr No. 14 and to the Senior Naval Officer Commanding the Persian Gulf Division No. 560/4/36. Enclo. to S. No. 82. Despatch from the British Consulate, Ahwaz, to His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, British Legation, Tehran, No. 51, dated the 7th August 1936. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your despatch No. 38 (560/ 2/36) dated the 26th June last on the subject of a new floating dock for the Iranian Navy and a proposal to transfer naval headquarters to Bandar Shahpur. 438 (C)F&amp;PD2 . I took the opportunity afforded by a recent visit to Abadan to inter view Mr. Clegg, the Acting Manager of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, in regard to this question. He informed me that the floating dock had now finally been fixed into position at Bandar Shahpur with the help of the Company’s tugs. It appears that the site originally decided upon tor tins dock was near the mouth of the Karun river opposite Mohammerah see Mr. Watkinson’s telegram I^o. 18 to you of the 27th July 1935. The reason for the change of site is not clear. One version is to the effect thao the Italian suppliers persuaded the Iranian Government to order a larger dock than they originally intended in order to accommodate cruisers of 8,000 to 10,000 tons displacement which the Iranian Government are said to .be thinking of purchasing. However that may be, the dock actually supplied by Italy was far too large to be moored in the Karun River and it had per force to be placed elsewhere. It is impossible to say definitely whether this was fortuitous as the result of a blunder by the Navy Department or whether the site was deliberately changed in pursuance of a definite policy. 3 . Mr. Clegg had no knowledge of the rumoured intention on the part of the Iranian Government to transfer the naval base from Khorramshahr to Bandar Shahpur. The latter port will probably be made the naval head quarters but it will prove to be a costly undertaking as a large amount of land reclamation work will have to be taken in hand first of all. The policy of the Government is to make Bandar Shahpur the chief port of Iran as the terminus of the transiranian Railway and the naval question will probably be deferred until the railway is completed and in actual opera tion. it is however safe to assume that the transfer has been decided upon in principle but that the work will not be commenced for the time being owing to lack of funds. The country cannot stand the cost of simultaneous- Iv building the railway and creating a naval base out of the marshes at Bandar Shahpur—unless recourse is had to a foreign loan. 4. I also understand from Mr. Clegg that the Government has decided to dam the mouth of the Karun and divert the river into the Bahmanshir channel as a result of their dispute with Iraq about shipping rights in the Shatt-el Arab. Whether thi^ scheme will materialise remains to be seen. 5. From another source I have been informed that naval headquarters only will be transferred to Bandar Shahpur whilst the workshops remain at Khorramshahr where they are now situated. This will be effected when the port at Bandar Shahpur has been constructed but this will not be ready for a few years. The Shah is said to be very anxious that the port should be finished when the railway line from North to South is in operation over its whole length, and for this purpose has ordered the Ministry of commu nications to spend about seventy million tomans on the construction of a town capable of housing five thousand persons with five more jetties at the port etc. 1 6 . I have also discussed the question with the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, who although cognisant of these rumours was unable to give any definite information about them.

With reference to my despatch No. 388 of the 8 th August, I have the honoui to inform you chat the trial of 23 persons, mostly former members of the staff of the Ministry of Communications, involved in the scandals con nected wffh road and other contracts granted by the Ministry, opened on the August and ended on the 8 th September with the conviction of 18 of t e accused who were sentenced to terms of imprisonment varying from three years to two months.

They were convicted on these and other charges and sen- l' ears . 'mpnsonment each and to fines of Rials 339,500 and Kials -73,500 respectively. Mr. Issakoores the Company’s Tehran ao-ent was convicted of acting as an intermediary for Mr. Lubin, and was sen- tenced to six months imprisonment. 3. How far the charges connected with Mr. Lubin are well-founded I am unable to say. In March last Mr. Lubin strongly denied the accusa tions which appear to have been based on statements made by Koores during preliminary examinations. The defence on these charges appears to have been that Koores’ statements on the subject were contradictory, that no record of the payments appeared in his 1 books and that Mr. Lubin was known always to be borrowing from Koores for current expenditure and so is not likely to have had available here such large sums to hand over to Koores for use as bribes, as he is alleged to have done. On behalf of Koores it was argued that so talented a linguist as Mr. Lubin, who was further well acquainted with^many highly placed personalities in Tehran, would have had no need of Koores’ services as an intermediary in such transactions. The Court does not appear to have been impressed by these arguments. 4 It is interesting that no attempt whatever has been made to prose cute any of the foreigners whose names have been mentioned in the proceed ings, the excuse apparently being that they all most obligingly turned King’s evidence. Most people in Tehran seem to think the accused were guilty and deserved all they got. The only excuse made on their behalf is that they and many other Government servants like them are quite unable on the small salaries they receive to keep up the position they are now practically bound to maintain. They have therefore no alternative but to accept bribes, which they regard more as a payment for services rendered than anything else. 5. The recent trial has received as much publicity as those of Mohamed Ali Mansur and Monsieur Reza Afshar. There have been many references to the acuteness of the Judges’ comments and questions and to the able arguments of counsel on either side. Evidently it was desired to show the world how far the administration of justice has advanced in this country. It remains to be seen whether this series of trials will do anything to raise the standard of honesty in Persian public life. 6 . Shortly after the conclusion of the trial it was announced that Monsieur Sadr, the Minister of Justice, had resigned. It is rumoured that he was in fact dismissed because the judges in the present trial had taken bribes from some of the accused. There is also a story in circulation that the highly respectable Monsieur Rezaquli Hedayat, the President of the Court of Appeal, who presided over the trial of Monsieur Ali Mansqur, is being dismissed as well. I have not, however, been able to obtain any confirmation of this latter rumour and the real reason of Monsieur Sadr’s dismissal must at least remain open to doubt v 7.

Like other distinguished Arab visitors however^ he has doubtless done something to strengthen the sense of the common fellowship of all Arab countries, which is growing rapidly m Iraq. Mis visit has also flattered the Iraqis and confirmed them m their conceit that Bagdad is rapidly becoming the hub of the Arab world. 4 .

(85) Despatch fhom British Legation, Tehran, to the Right Honourable Anthony Ede.n, M.C., M.P., the Foreign Office, No. 458, dated the I have the honour to report that in the course of the last few days the Shah has b-trothed both his daughters, the elder to the son of the Prime Minister, Mr. Jam and the younger to the older son of Qawam-ul-Mulk (Persian Personalities No. 50). 2. Mr. Jam junior who is about 21, was educated in France, where he has passed the greater part of the last six years. He has now entered the Military School at Tehran. Qawam-ul-Mulk’s son was educated at Bristol University and I hear from a reliable English source here that he is not burdened with brains nor with any great sense of responsibility. He is said to be on intimate and excellent terms with his prospective brother-in-law the Valiahd. 3 . It is not yet known when the marriages will take place, possibly not for some time. It is interesting that the Shah should be allying his family with that of a popular if rather ineffective member of the civil government (and incidentally very friendly to this country), and secondly to one of the best known families in Shiraz. Qawam-ul-Mulk was compelled to exchange his properties there for others near Nishapur in Khorasan and now resides very quietly in Tehran but lately when in Shiraz I was assured that the Qawam’s family continues to enjoy considerable prestige in the province of Ears. 4 .

(36) Despatch from British Legation, Tehran, to the Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc., the Foreign Office, No. 432-E., dated the 18th September 1936. With reference to my telegram No. 172 of the 28th August last, I have the honour to report the following information in connection with the139 ra0n ° P0ly ° f imp ° rts of motor vehicles . Vare parts, nrl , 2 *° Rations have as yet been published, but I hear that Monsieur Dn, the only Belgian official now employed at the Ministry of Finance has been put in charge of the monopoly. Monsieur Dris may be a financial expel t but I gather that his knowledge of cars and the motor trade in gen eral is negligible. His first suggestion to the Minister of Finance was it is said that it would be difficult to put the monopoly into active operation immediately and that the trade should be allowed to continue as formerly for a year during which period the situation and the trade might be studied carefully. Monsieur Davar, however, insisted on the immediate putting into eilect of the monopoly; whatever the cost might be, he intended turn ing out all the Iraqi motor dealers who had for so long been amassing money at the expense of the public. 3. According to one of the principal motor dealers, if they all had to leave, they would have sums due to them equivalent to about one million pounds sterling which they would naturally wish to take out of the country. 4. In view of Monsieur Davar’s stated intentions I was very surprised to learn from a reliable source that he has now appointed Mr. Kettanch, the Dodge and Chrysler agent, as his adviser for a period of 18 months on a fixed salary. Mr. Kettanch has, I understand, handed over to the Monopolv all his stocks and offices. In return he is to be allowed to export his accum- mulated funds, and permission to purchase exchange for one-third of the amount has, it appears, already been granted to him. 5. It is not as yet known how Monsieur Davar intends to handle this very complicated and difficult trade; he would appear to think that a five per cent, profit only should be made on sales of cars, spare parts, etc. Prac tically all sales of motor vehicles in Iran are effected on credit, payment being spread over a period of about twelve months. A substantial margin is essential to cover interest and the possibility of some instalments never being paid. Where spare parts are concerned, an even larger margin is naturally necessary in order to meet the loss on stocks unsold. Unless the monopoly is to be run on philanthropic lines it is not likely that the public will benefit much from the change. 6 . 1 am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (unnumbered), to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, No 213 and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad, No. 71.

Enclo. to S. No. ( 88 ). Despatch from British V ice- Consulate, Khorramshahr, to His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, No. 113, dated the 2nd Sep tember 1936. I have the honour to report that Sarhang Bayendor left for Tehran on 26th August, and it is rumoured that he has been sent for, among other things, on account of the lack of discipline in the Iranian Navy. It is said that the Civil Authorities of Abadan and Khorramshahr have sent a com plaint to His Imperial Majesty the bhah and that Agha Hassan Farzaneh, the Governor of Khorramshahr, who left for Tehran, on 25th will make a personal report. 2. Apart from cases of drunkenness among the sailors on shore leave, oppression of shop-keepers, and minor examples of indiscipline, there have been two serious occurrences in the last few months, which have antagonised the civil authorities. 3 . On 19th June four petty officers, who were drunk presumably, abused and assaulted the Public Prosecutor and a Judge and their wives in the road in Abadan. The courts were closed for several days on account of the in juries inflicted. The petty officers were dealt with by the Naval Autho rities and were said to have been admonished only.4. On the 14th August (mde para. 235 of Diary No. 15), the petty officer m charge of the naval piquet in Abadan, fired three shots at the ??i 1S ^ aZmleh Wlt ] 1 the mtentlon of kil,in g him, and then ran amok and self ^ m ° re and m0rta ly wounded three others, finally shooting him- 5. The Bombay Iranians are said to have complained about bad be haviour of the sailors of the “Babr” and “Palang” on their last visit to Bombay in April. 6 . It is suggested that Sarhang Bavendor is not a good disciplinarian. He has a fiery temper, it is true, but when complaints against sailors are made by civilians, he invariably takes the side of the sailors. 7. The Naval Detention Barracks in Khorramshahr which have three large cells, usually contain ten prisoners, under sentence for purely naval offences of indiscipline on parade or in barracks. Sailors are seldom sen tenced for civil offences, although it is not unusual for civilians to be ‘'detained” in the Naval Detention Barracks. The servant of the Bais-i- Nazmieh and a policeman who are alleged to have seduced the petty officer’s woman, and therefore were instrumental in causing him to run amok, are so detained. 8 . It is not thought that the complaints against Sarhang Bayendor will lead to his removal, because there is no other officer competent to relieve him. 9. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Acting British Consul, Ahwaz (No. 1114). (89) Despatch from British Legation, Tehran, to the Right Honourable, Sir Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc., the Foreign Office, No. 453/(149/14/36), dated the 2nd October 1936., In my despatch No. 396 of June 12th, written in anticipation of the return of His Majesty’s late Minister to Tehran, I had the honour to report that during the period February to June there had occurred no fresh un toward incident and therefore that Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen s hojie had been justified that improved relations would be demonstrated by the non-recurrence of old troubles and the absence of fresh ones. 2 . I am happy to be able to record that since then leaving aside one essentially trivial incident on a British tramp steamer at Abadan on which I am awaiting the views of His Majesty’s Government, there have been many points on which the attitude of the Iranian authorities towards British interests has been satisfactory, and practically none on which it has given cause for complaint with the single large exception of BnUsh partmipation in arrans'ements for the future control of the Shatt-el-Arab. io tneir aiti tode on thT pomt which has been retrograde, I will return later, enumerat ing to beain with, points that are favourable, 3 His Maiesty’s late Minister expressed on more than one occasion 5.

Secondly, the Persian W d^er'stX^o^njnSl^ wJT 7 rnaHrmore^mpensation has been paid in full; the sum of^me 74 thousand Rials has been extracted from the budget of the Ministry ol War The delay in payment was no doubt bad and damaging m various ways but the patience oi the Government of India has enabled he matters t?be settled without bad feeling, whether private here or public in India. 5 Thirdly, as I have reported in a separate despatch, the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs have made a complete and happy volte face from S aSitude of two years ago as regards the ^ Official Wireless, news. In 1934 not only was the Persian Agence Rars un willing to receive copies of our news, but a literal interpretation of com- munications from the Ministry of Foreign ) ^ alrs / ould T h h a ^ e a f t ^ e e ^3 from being sent to any outside His Majesty s Legation. This attitude was revived in March of this year. By June Monsieur Schelly was asking me to send him the British Official Wireless reports of any important speeches by prominent British statesmen, and by September the Agence Pars had definitely agreed to send us their bulletins free and to take m daily tne ■nvifioU WirAlpss in exehanore. 6 . There are two other small points which are perhaps worth mention ing The Senior Naval Officer recently asked me to obtain facilities for Commander Harvey, ,H- M. S. Bideford, to visit the British cemeteries on Heniam and Basidu. Last year Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen obtained a promise from Monsieur Kazemi that persons that he designated would be permitted to visit these graves. Not only have the Ministry of Foreign 'Affairs made no difficulty about this, but the head of the British Depart ment has pressed me to let him know whether the graves are found to be in a satisfactory state. Secondly, over a teasing matter of the distribution of part of the debts of a Mr. Sequara to creditors in this country, the event has proved that my anticipations did less than justice to Persian good sense and that you, Sir, had formed a better founded expectation. 6 -A. The above are official matters. I am bound, and glad, to report that in connection with the recent tour of 20 British members of the National Students Union, the Persian authorities in various Departments and pro vinces gave much assistance, and evinced much friendly interest and good will. I shall have the honour to report at greater length on this visit in a separate despatch. In this general review I will merely say that many Persian officials have expressed their satisfaction with the visit and the hope that it will be repeated, and that the students themselves spoke with great warmth of their reception at all points by Persian officials, and as far as I know, without any complaint whatsoever. To those acquainted with Persia this is remarkable and must be given some significance. Similarly Doctor Schofield, Head of Loughborough Technical College, visiting factories and technical schools in Iran by invitation of the Persian Government, and under the auspices of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, tells me that the Persian officials he has met have been almost too kind to him. Courtesy to an official guest is natural; it is the fact that the invitation was extended that has the greater interest. 7. Lastly, I and several members of the staff of His Majesty’s legation have been struck by the great friendliness amounting in some cases almost to special attention, with which the admittedly restricted number of Per sians that we see, receive us both officially and perhaps still more socially. 8 . In the light of the above I venture to ask your indulgence for some special pleading on the subject of Persia’s present unsatisfactory attitude towards British participation in future control of the Shatt-el-Arab—in dulged in, not for the sake of beautiful Persian eyes, but partly because the fact that negotiations are being conducted in Baghdad may result not un naturally in His Majesty’s Government receiving a preponderance of the143 Iraqi point of view, and still more in order that you, Sir, mav have as accurate and up-to-date an estimate as I can furnish as to the mental atti tude of the Persian Foreign Office on this subject when His Maiesty’s Minister begins his dealings with them. 9. The day after my arrival here, on Christmas Eve, His Majesty's late Minister took me to see M. Kazemi At that interview which Sir Hu Hie Knatehbull-Hugessen described as the worst he had had with him. Monsieur Kazemi stated that his Government could not agree to British participation in the signature of any Irano-Iraqi Convention for the future control of the Shatt-el-Arab- Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen spent some active weeks, and on the 16th January Monsieur Kazemi made him a written confidential ofter as part of which the Persian Government would agree to full British participation on condition that the Iraqi Government proposed this to them in writing. Sir Hughe had misgivings about some aspects of the offer; the Foreign Office and His Majesty’s Embassy in Baghdad viewed it with very deep suspicion and it was eventually considered unacceptable and inappro priate. So much so that it was not considered worth attempting to elimin ate the unsatisfactory features of the offer with a view to it being possible to accept it in an innocuous or more reasonable form. On the 16th January Monsieur Kazemi told the Turkish Ambassador that he was awaiting the Iraqi Government’s written proposal that His Majesty’s Government should participate fully in a River Convention. He and his successor continued to wait. The points that I wish to suggest as regards Monsieur Kazemi’s offer are firstly that in Persian eyes it was an initiative, one purpose of which anyway was to meet the requirement which His Majesty’s Minister had been pressing so strongly, and secondly that there was nothing so demo nstrably vicious about it that in Persian eyes, His Majesty’s Government might not have kept it alive. Monsieur Kazemi did indeed in February modify his offer with a view to making it more practicable and asked His Majesty’s Government to sponsor it with the Iraqi Government, but his pro posals remained unacceptable and inappropriate; he was advised to get down to serious work on the British draft Convention. I am not clear whether the Iraqi Government ever made this advice practicable. 10. Admittedly about the middle of January the Shah himselt had knocked a very large hole in the carefully elaborated British draft when he stated explicitly the Persian Government’s inability to agree to the inclusion of certain waters of the Karun and Bahmanshir, which the Persians would no doubt argue, fed no Iraqi port, minor or major- The Shah, however, expressly told His Majesty’s Minister at the same time that he would be quite ready to co-ordinate management of the Karun and to order that the advice of the tripartite Shatt-el-Arab Commission should be followed. This Commission would of course include a Persian representative convenient for this liaison work. This readiness has been repeated since then by Persian Ministers who, seeing that the Convention was British i^ceffiion as well as in draft, may have expected that His Majesty s Governm t would be interested in what they (the Persians) evidently regarded a S a reasonable compromise proposal. In fact y “xplor- latent in their suggestion have not to their knowledge been seriously expior 1 11 On Anril 18th in my first interview with Monsieur Samiy for busi- C-pr- Tr xoe ii e ncv confirmed that his Government would, eg ess purposes, His Excellency co ■ e U Ki ec t to Iraq proposing it; &gt; our full participation in a Eiver j ^ repeated Monsieur e asked the help of His Majesty s a ' rep^ did lazerni’s revised date, the May « f^he Councih ^ ot give any kind of notice th at li , ^ Persian attitude as regards [ajesty’s Government w-ere no _ Convention would be modified but [is Maiesty’s Government an / ver y unpreeisely) made condi- : is a fact that Monsieur Kazemi s offer was ^ery I onal upon a time limit. 438(C) F&amp;rnH4 12. In the 8 months following Monsieur Kazemi’s attempt to meet His Majesty’s Minister’s point-of-view there has been, m Persian eyes no res ponse of any kind on the part of His Majesty’s Government The fall of the graceless Monsieur Kazemi made no difference. The British con ribution has remained mainly the Draft Tripartite Convention which would clamp for ever on the Shatt-el-Arab, the Bahmanshir and an important part of the Karun—the waters feeding Iran’s two principal ports—a Commission con fined to one Persian and one Iraqi representative, and one representative of Great Britain, Iraq’s ally. When British representatives during the last months have spoken on the subject of the Irano-Iraqi n egotiations, it has almost invariably been to support the Iraqi attitude. If His Majes y s Government attach great importance to a Tripartite Commission deprived of the Karun and Bahmanshir—a point on which I have not been entirely certain—I fear that as a perhaps inevitable consequence of the course of events since January, the diplomatic skill of His Majesty’s Minister may be taxed even higher than was that of his predecessor in order to convince the Persian Government that the British representative on a Commission composed of three will ever support the Persian view against the Iraqi on any major problem should such arise. The Persian Government may there fore be tempted to refer the question, as Monsieur Scheily has so often advi sed, back to Geneva with the object of getting on any Commission that may be recommended, representatives of those supposedly neutral countries of Scandinavia, whose nationals are doing such satisfactory work for Iran on the Kampsax Consortium and other industrial enterprises. 13. The above paragraphs are very obviously special pleading, the moti ves for which have been stated. 1 have, as you are aware, repeatedly re presented to Persian Ministers the grasping and unreasonable character of their demands. The Persian Government may perhaps be piqued but they can hardly be surprised that His Majesty’s Government have recently given priority of attention to Turkey, to Palestine and to Egypt. I believe that their correct and even friendly attitude to us indicated in the earlier para graphs derives partly no doubt from the fall of Monsieur Kazemi but much more, from their respect for Great Britain and for her foreign policy since the Abyssinian war began and subsequently; and, though it is conjecture only, I think that they would be responsive to a less passive policy on our part provided that the Iraqi Government are not first beguiled or bribed into a separate deal, and that our advice does not seem to them too slavishly Iraqi. On the other hand I think that the effect may be generally unfor tunate if His Majesty’s new Minister is confined to repeating to the^Persian Poreign Office the alteration of criticisms and reproaches with references to the Clive undertaking and our British draft Convention which must have made Monsieur Samiy rather weary of his talks with me on the only major political question m which his country and my own are closely concerned- 14.

T. (B.)-165, dated 23rd September 1936. 1 have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a copy of an article of Iran published in ‘ iLe Joumal de . . * ast sentence of the article intimates that enquiries from abroad with a view to obtaining concessions for exploitation, are invited This would appear to confirm a confidential but rather vague report that the Iranian Government had some scheme in mind to grant concessions for the exploita ion of specified areas, of which, it was said, there would be ten147 not constitute an international engagement in the sense that, in so far as they are embodied in provisions of Persian law, the Persian Government, are not entitled to change them without the consent of the foreign Governments concerned”. Paragraph 7 then continues : “it should not, however, be inferred from this that the safeguards are wholly without value or effect. His Majesty’s Government would, I am advised, be entitled to contend that although the Persian Government may have'the right to alter the provisions of this law in matters which concern the safeguards, they are bound, unless and until the law is thus altered, to observe its provisions rigidly, and consequently to apply the safeguards fully”. But if even at the date of that despatch it was to be presumed that the Persian Government had the right to “alter the provisions of their law in matters which concern the safeguards”, subsequent events have considerably increased the difficulty of adopting a contrary attitude. In the first place a considerable volume of legislation has been placed on the statute-book in the interval which has radically changed the situation since the assurances were given; and the Persian Government thus have ample precedents on which they could rely in the event of any protest with regard to the present law. More important still in this connexion would appear to be the expiry of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty, since it was held in para graph 4 of Sir John Simon’s above-quoted despatch that “the strongest argument which His Majesty’s Government could probably make for the internationally binding character of the safeguards would be based on the fact that they were signed on the same date as the Tariff Autonomy Treaty and on the contention that they were thus really part of the consideration for that Treaty”. Thus though the expiry of that Treaty would hardly seem to be a conclusive factor in the situation, it would yet appear to have shorn away the main buttress of the contention that the safeguards formed part of a binding international agreement. 4 In so far as it is relevant to cite the view of lawyers in Tehran, I would also mention that in a memorandum prepared early this year by Maitre Raphael Aghababoff, a leading Armenian lawyer, on the subject of the juridical situation of foreigners in Iran, it is stated the safeguards “sont consider^es par le gouvernement de n’avoir aucune valeur legale et ne sont pas reconnus par les autorites iraniennes”. This may undoubtedly be taken as being the view of the average lawyer here. It is true that when an employ^ of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was arrested at Abadan early this year, an appeal to the safeguards by His Majesty s Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr apparently earned some weight with the GOTernor but I think that the conclusion to be drawn from this is ^ regulations take some time to penetrate to the provinces ^dooWoneshnger on for some time before they are recognised as extinct. Leaving aside lor the moment the merits of the case I do safeguards in Tehran to-day would have the slightest chance of succ . 5. Taking all the above into account, I presume that you would not desire His Maiesty’s Legation either to protest against the provisions ot Article 3 of this law or to intervene should a British Subject charged wit being a smuggler in the possession of arms, be tried before a mditary eou ^ I should however, be grateful for your instructions on this Ppi nt J-“ d a , in due course on the wider question of the present validity of the safegua in general. , . . 6 In conclusion it is perhaps of interest to notice that this law was not passed by the Majlis in the ordinary way. It was approved by the cedure, have been passed in this simplified way. 498(C) FAPD ^148 the in Iran, Circular Despatch JNo. 37. Enclo. to S. No. 91. , rvrrK-ncr nr helDmsr to smuggle.

This enterprise is expected to supplant the idea of the formation of a Steam Navigation Company, suggested in December 1935 (see No. 9 in List of 15th April 1936, sent under cover of despatch No. ‘188-E. of 16th April 1936). (Bushire Diary for July 1936.)149 2 . Steps have been taken by for the establishment of a cement a company composed of local merchants factory at Bushire. (“Etela’at” of 4th September 1936.) 3 \ Thanks to the efforts of Mr. Hekmet, Governor of Yezd, and Dr. laheri, a Deputy of Yezd, it has been decided to form a company with a capital of five million rials (£62,500) with a view to erecting a spinning (“Setareh ye Djehane” of 15th September 19’36.) 4. A company with a capital of six and a half million rials (£81,250) has been formed at Tabriz for the installation of a large weaving mill. ’ (“Setareh ye Djehane” of 19th September 1936.) 5. With reference to No. 7 in the list of 18th August 1936, sent under cover of despatch No. 397-E. of 19th August 1936, the Company formed by the Tabriz tea merchants is now reported to have a capital of 4,150,000 rials (£51,875) and is called the “Sherkat Sehami Chai Azerbaidjan dar Tabriz”. The company will deal in tea and all kinds of Indian produce exported to Iran. It has an agency in Calcutta^—the “Sherkat Chai Cal cutta”, No. 10, Mosten Street, Calcutta. (Bazaar report 23rd September 1936.) 6 . According to “Le Messager de Teheran” of 2nd October, a company with a capital of 15 million rials (£187,500) has been formed at Isfahan for the manufacture of shirtings. 7.

Mr. Oakshott mentioned that some bule a ^ ) ’ -v. 6 It seems conceivable that the Iranian Government are considering thp nrissihilities of raisino 1 a foreign loan. Even at present they are obtain ing credit by indirect means such as that from the Imperial Bank of Iram referred to above and the attempt to obtain credit in the United Km ^ do “ for cotton goods purchases. These credits are not a direct assistance to the Iranian GSvernment to meet its considerable foreign obligations but are no doubt of great assistance during the present acute shortage of foreig exchange. They may be considered as palliatives rather than remedies. 7 A credit was recently obtained from a German heavy industry consortium for the supply or iron and steel goods and railway material. The commercial secretarv is informed [see his despatch to the Uepa me of Overseas Trade No. O. T. (B.) 179 of 15th October] tha a group of firms is being constituted in the United Kingdom with the ot supplying matallurgical plant, railway material etcetera to the Ira ni^ Government, possibly on a credit basis and with some form of guaranteed payment out of future royalties from the Anglo-Iraman Oil Company. The Societe Generale des Constructions, a State-controlled concern with a161 nominal capital of 300,000,000 rials (£3,750,000), is calling for tenders tor the construction of four cement factories, for which paylent fifties are certain to be required. Finally, His Imperial Ma/styX stTm k S reCent I 181 , 1 t0 Ta0riz ' is re P or ted in the press as haHng stated that Tabriz must be linked by railway with Tehran during, the next three years If this is really his intention! the need for a loa! becomes more urgent than ever. 8. In spite of the present heavy expenditure and current commitments it would seem that m the long run Iran’s financial situation is not at all unfavourable Her recognised foreign debt is small, and although internal obligations, largely in the form of participation in new industrial, agri cultural or commercial ventures, have increased very considerably during the last two years, it would be difficult to deny that much of this money has been invested to good advantage and will probably yield returns. Ex penditure on the railway has reached its peak and is'likely to diminish to reasonable proportions in the next two or*three years. ' The output of some of the industrial concerns, e.g. t , textile and sugar beet factories, will eventually replace goods imported from abroad for which foreign exchange now has to be obtained. Royalties and tax payments from the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company are at present well over £2,000,000 annually and there is no reason to suppose that any considerable decrease is likely. Taxation is undoubtedly high, partly as a result of abstention from foreign borrowing, but the various constructional and industrial projects under way has provided additional employment and undoubtedly increased the national income. ■ 9. It is of course impossible to forecast whether Iran will continue her present rate of development and of creditworthiness in the event of the decease of the present Shah. Once developments in the sphere of com munications and industry have received such impetus as has been the case in this country, and when so much public and private money has been invested in these concerns, it is difficult to imagine that there can be way going back on what has been done. The railway must be completed now, and public and private vested interests representing a large proportion of the country’s wealth will demand protection from internal disturbances and external competition. Unexpected developments may arise in Iran as elsewhere, but there appears to be room for a reasonable measure of opti mism. 10.

Despatch from British Embassy, Istambul, to the Eight Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc., No. 509, dated the 6th October 1936. I have the honour, with reference to Sir P. Loraine’s despatch No. 294 of the 23rd May, to inform you that the Secretary General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs is reported to have made a statement on the subject of Turco-Iranian relations to a representative of the newspaper “Tan” on the 2nd October. 2 . Monsieur Nluman Menemencioglu stated that a delegation led by Monsieur Cemal Huand, formerly Turkish Minister at Berne (see semi official correspondence ending with Sir P. Loraine’s letter to Mr. O’Malley of the 17th July), would shortly leave for Iran and would discuss with the Iranian Government questions concerning security, frontiers, residence, judicial assistance, extradition, commerce and customs. It was hoped that the conclusion of agreements on these points would not be long delayed. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Representa tive at Tehran and to the Department of Overseas Trade. ( 96 ) Despatch from British Legation, Tehran, to the Eight Honourable, Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc., the Foreign Office, No. 491/(255/54/36), dated the 31st October 1936. I have the honour to inform you that the Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the Counsellor to this Legation very confidentially yesterday that the Shah had designated him to replace Monsieur Ala as Iranian Minister in London. Monsieur Soheily went on to say that he was pleased and flattered by this as the London Legation was the most important post in the Iranian Diplomatic Service, and the idea of ^ 0n ^ 0] ^^ ia( ^ always attracted him, but he also had considerable misgivings as the Shah had made it clear that he expected a good deal from him in the new capacity Monsieur Soheily was evidently pleasurably excited by the prospect of London, but hardly less alarmed. Mr. Butler expressed the conviction that he would find a cordial welcome at the Foreign Office for His Majesty s late Minister had certainly reported the presence in Monsieur ^o eily of other qualities besides more good will in the course of their co operation last year. Mr Butler then asked what sort of results Monsieur Soneily thought the Shah had m mind, and Monsieur Soheily referred to ^ e ?i! an n G ^ lf - ^ Butler Said there had been 0n e or two nZJnPP f d T tS m ^ he Gul !’. and wished Colonel Bayendor would use his the nocdtinn ^ c £ untr ymen there the British conception of not ?ne deTtf nf a Ca P tam of a vessel &gt; biit it was presumably Ki 7 pTTn harl ' tt* ^hat the Shah had in mind; and Monsieur given His Majesty s late Minister to understand that theBahrein question was virtually dead. Monsieur Soheily did not dissent from this; what he said was a little difficult to understand (the conversation took place at a Turkish reception) but he spoke of small islands in the Gulf and specifically mentioned Tamb. The drift of his remarks seemed to be that Persia to-day was impatient—perhaps ‘insistent’ in the sense used recently in connection with India better expresses what he meant to convey—and that Great Britain was rather slow. Mr. Butler referred to the evacuation of Hen jam and Basidu. Monsieur Soheily knew that as regards other islands in the Gulf, we were not free agents but trustees for the Arab sheikhs, and our interest in the Arab coast was not diminishing. The conversation turned to the Shatt-el-Arab. Monsieur Soheily said that he was not impressed by Monsieur Ala’s recent letter to you, Sir, but your reply to him,—Monsieur Soheily made a gesture which seemed to suggest that an impasse had been reached. Mr. Butler said that Monsieur Ala’s letter had seemed to him to have contained two or three provocative passages and that your reply set out very clearly the views of His Majesty’s Government. Referring to the .Shatt-el-Arab, Monsieur Soheily said that he still did not know what the attitude of the Iraqis really was. Mr. Butler suggested that he should have a full discussion of these questions with myself, and confined himself to emphasising how unfavourably the Persian position as regards arbitration contrasted with that of Iraq. 2. Mr. Butler enquired whether Monsieur Ala was to succeed to Monsieur Soheily here, but Monseiur Soheily was non-committal. 3 . Lest the preceding paragraphs should give rise to an unjustified deduction, I would add that Monsieur Ala’s move from London has long been foreshadowed by those in Ministry of Foreign Affairs circles. It is the practice for a new Minister for Foreign Affairs to change the incumbents of the principal Embassies, and Monsieur Ala is practically the only one not yet moved by Monsieur Samiy. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India No. 237 and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad No. 89. ( 97 ) Translation of a Note-Verbale from the Consular Depastmeot, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to His Majesty s ’ No. 22103, dated Shahrivar, 28th, 1315 (September 19th, 193b). The Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have the honour in reply to the letter No. 442, of August 7th 1936, of His Britanmc Majesty’s Legation regarding the place for examination and dis, seeds to state that according to information received from the c0 ™P ete 1 Quarters no steps are being taken at present for disinfecting seeds . an ?muort licence is given only in respect of seeds and plants which are accom- nauied bv an official sanitary certificate issued by the countries of origin. Those (seeds and plants) which are not accompanied by sanitary certificates will, in accordance with the regulations, be destroyed. It is, however, intended that a disinfection service will be established in Teheran. ( 98 ) Despatch from BRmsH Legation,^ Tehran, ^to the ^Eig^^ Office, Nq T 467^232/26/36),'dated the 12th October 1936. I have the honour to enclose herein ^ ^.aii 1^1 nteresting matter provided by His Majes y -judgment of this Lega- wd general conditions A^an;^ of a series'of don presents a very fair picture. As tins 438(C) F&amp;PDsimilar reports from His Majesty’s Consular Officers m Iran, I am ventur ing to make a few general observations on them in a separate despatch. Now in transmitting Mr. Urquhart’s memorandum I will confine comment to drawing attention to his description of the position of Russians in Azerbaijan which contrasts with that described by Colonel Daly in his similar appreciation (F. No. 449-N./36), as regards Khorassan, and to the account of the treatment of minorities. A somewhat similar policy has been followed with regard to the small minorities of British origin, such as the Kurramis. The Iranian Government quite evidently do not want to have minorities of foreign nationality scattered through the country. -They have therefore consistently raised difficulties when such people wish to renounce Iranian nationality and the police in the provinces are always ready to bully people of doubtful nationality but taking out “sijjils”. Once they have taken out sijjils they are, as far as our information goes, left in peace. The moral of all this would appear to be that it is better for those people who have become almost completely identified with Iran, and who intend to continue to live here, in their own interests to become Iranian subjects unless His Majesty’s representatives can give them adequate pro tection. This in fact extremely difficult to do when they live in outlying parts such as Gurgan, Amol etcetera. 2 . As regards Mr. Urquhart’s remarks on the military forces in Azerbaijan, I am advised that he is not correct in supposing that Moslems enjoy a monopoly of the career of regular combatant officer. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India No. 227, and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad No. 84. ( 99 ) Despatch from British Legation, Tehran, to the Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.P., M.C.^ etc., etc., etc., the Foreign Office, No. 466 (332/27/34), dated the 12th October 1936. Under cover of my despatch No. 467 (232/26/36), of to-day’s date, I had the honour to send you a copy of a particularly interesting memoran dum on political and general conditions in Azerbaijan from His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz. 2 . This completed the series of political reports requested in the circular despatch from His Majesty’s Legation No. 6 of the 15th February last, and I venture to think that it is possible to form from them a detailed picture of Iran as it is to-day, 10 years after the coronation of the present Shall. I regret that no similar report is available as regards the Caspian provinces, the most furtile in Iran. The prosperity and enlargement of the jute factory at Resht, the new fine road along'the Caspian to Shahi, and the development of the cultivation of tea, rice and oranges and the silk industry are some of the many signs of great material advance there. As regards the Army, too, although several of these Consular reports refer to a visible Improvement m the discipline and efficiency of the local troops, it cannot be claimed that they furnish much to amplify the admittedly rather exiguous information that His Majesty’s Legation supplies as regards the Persian Army. While several local commanders, notably General Euiel in tt^wT 1 M u eklZ1 i ' 0 ur g ao are t0 be capable men, vdiat Mr. Urquhart describes as the Imperial policy of eliminating all who enjoy any appearance of personal power vis-a-vis the mass of the people applies at least equally to the Army. So much so that almost th e P only detailed prophesy I have been able to secure—from a landowner in Khorassan-as to the probable immediate consequences should thrihah unfortunately pass from the scene in the near future, is to the effect that E169 The reports in this series that have seemed of special interest are those from the two turbulent provinees, Khorassan and Azerbaiian and from the twowhich are virtually self-supporting, Azerbaijan again and Knuzistan As regards these three provinees there seems general agree ment on three pricipal points. First, and potentially the most dangerous S^ 61116t ^ ie P resenti regime which is recognised to be the bhah and the Shah only; and this in spite of the security he has created the strong and wise treatment of Minorities to which Mr. Urquhart refers’ and in spite of, or because of, the net unsuccessful introduction of many progressive measures, socially and in the economic field. Secondly the Shah’s success is breaking completely and perhaps permanently the old local centres of authority and of resistance to the central power. Mechanical transport has been and must remain a big factor in favour of the Tehran Government in this connection. And thirdly, the extreme paucity of officials who under this regime are willing to undertake even minor responsibility, or who possess even mediocre ability. This point was discussed in the Annual Report for last year. I do not wish to question either the harm that this dearth is now doing, e.g. } in the Khuzistan customs service, nor its possible effect on the permanence of the Shah’s work, but there is reason to think that it is much more marked in the provinces than in Tehran. In the course of not very long conversations both Mr. Fraser of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company this Spring, an&lt;T Doctor Schofield, Head of the Loughborough Technical College, who is now visiting Iran, volun teered to me that they had been pleasurably surprised by the quality of the officials at the head of the various public and semi-public institutions in Tehran, compared with what they had found in the provinces. And— though this is a different point—when the Persian Government engage officials from abroad, they seem successful in getting good ones. 3. It may be observed that none of the reports stress the kindling of an Iranian national feeling often associated with the Shah. There is no doubt that this feeling exists: it is probably stronger in Tehran than else where, but talk reported to this Legation of humble people at Meshed and of tribal leaders in the Kashgai country attest its existence outside the capital and other centres of development, and it must I think, be reckoned an imponderable that favours on the whole the present dynasty. 4. In the interesting General Survey at the close of his memorandum, His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz did not venture on a prophesy as to what would follow the Shah’s demise, beyond the opinion that each succeeding year of the Shah’s lifetime will render the maintenance of order easier for his successors. This is the general view, and time may also have an import ant modifying influence on the unpopularity of the regime. According to reports from several quarters, both conscription and the unveiling of women are not only now accepted but are even popular with part of the popula tion affected. Further, though the standard of Irving among many sections of the population seems at present to be getting actually worse, the passage of a few years must enable many of the enterprises started by the Shah, to improve some of the conditions they attack, if at first mainly through the giving of employment and good wages. And there is of course the bearing of time on the succession of the Valiahd. 5. As Mr. Urquhart writes, “the question of utmost interest is ‘What are the qualities of the Valiahd?’ His Imperial Highness does not consort with the Diplomatic Corps and not much is yet known of him. But the newly appointed Egyptian Minister, whose varied but not unbalanced career must have given him opportunities to judge men, had half an hour’s talk with him recently. Abdel Rahman Azzam told me that the young man’s ingenuousness on some points had tickled him, but he had formed a favourable impression and thought he discerned in him some of his father s strength. It is a pity that, according to the head of the Protocol Depart ment, the Shah feels tfiat he cannot spare his son to visit England as his representative to the Coronation next May, and I hope the more t hat it may eventually prove possible to establish some contact between the nfowfe/and170 hS of the two I have found in conversations during the last few months with His Majesty’s. Consular Officers from many parts of Persm unanimity of view that His Majesty’s Government must hope that the father’s strong rule will continue, and sufficiently long to permit ot a oeaceful succession by the Valiahd. The view is commonly expressed by mv coUeaSes h ere that an object of the Shah’s foreign policy is to secure Sisfac 3 relations with his neighbour states so that the succession may be undisturbed from without. This may help to explain the very correct attitude that since the fall of Monsieur Kazemi, the Persian Government has adopted towards His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. There is a strong feeling too that the Shah desires to regularise his relations with Iraq as soon as possible. 6 I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, No. 228 and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad No. 85. Enclo. to S. No. 99. A memorandum on political affairs in Azerbaijan. The subject-matter will be examined under three heads :— A. External, B. Internal, C. General survey. External. —(a) The U. S. S. R. The Russians were steadily extending their influence southwards into this district before the war. Penetration became more rapid under the justification of military necessity, and the completion of the railway from Julfa to Tabriz and of the highway over a considerable part of the Julfa-Rezaich route were overt expressions of an intention to annex the province at a suitable moment. The Russian revolu tion saved it for Persia. The Soviets disdained material conquest, but set about converting the people to communism. They failed. The Moslem population dislikes communistic principles, while the Tehran government, growing strong under Riza Khan, stoutly resisted the Russian influences, deporting persons suspected of acting as agents for the Russian Consulate- General, and hampering the propagandists in every possible way. Now the Bolshevists appear to have lost their first missionary enthusiasm. Whereas my predecessor was, even as recently as three or four years ago, receiving reports of Bolshevist intrigue, and propaganda (mainly from somewhat unreliable Armenian sources) I can find today no evidence of any such activity. So far as one can judge here, the Russians have for the time being adopted the policy of £ Tive and let live”, perhaps because they are fully occupied elsewhere. There is not at present any source of irrita tion along the frontier, although there appears to be a somewhat frigid correctness at points such as Julfa, where bathers on the Iranian side were recently warned to stay well within the mid-stream line, lest the Russians should fire on them. Matters commercial appear to be moving smoothly enough under the existing trade agreements; one does hear of disputes from time to time, as for example a recent one about the quality of the cement being delivered for the new grain silo, but they are matters for discussion and settlement locally; one also hears of good-neighbourly acts, such as the acceptance by the Russians of damaged grain, which could no longer be stored here, against cement of which the municipality stood in need. One has the impression here that Iran is on an eqpal footing with Russia, who shows no disposition to treat this country de haut en bas.171 Nevertheless, Russia remains the big neighbour who has strayed across ihe boundary wall in the past and may do so again. People here realise that in so far as Iran remains comparatively weak, backward and poor, thus far does she invite political, social and commercial penetration. The Iranian government is exceptionally strong at present and has success fully controlled Russian influence. But a police officer said some interest ing things in this connection a few days ago. He recalled that when Riza Khan was making his way to power and was regarded as the saviour of the country, he would have had the support of this province to the last man had the Russians backed their propaganda with force; but, he went on, if the Russians were to cross the frontier now, Azerbaijan would probably rally to their support against the Shah, so unpopular has he become. If this is true it is fortunate for the Shah that the Russians are not disposed to interfere. Even if it is not quite true, the discussion of such a topic does indicate a distrust of Russia. No opportunity is given to Russians today to teach, instruct or other wise disseminate Russian ideas. The Iranian government has turned to France for culture pure and simple, to Germany for technical instruction; but it would take several decades of sterilization before the deep impres sion made by the old Russia on the minds and ways of the people of Azerbaijan could be removed. For one person who speaks French there are dozens who speak Russian; for one German trained doctor there are dozens of artisans who have learned from the Russians. I arrived here some two years ago with a poor opinion of things Russian; it surprised me to find how, after a few months, I had come to accept the ever-repeated suggestion that Russian trained workmen and Russian products were in the nature of a gift from the gods in these days. I refer, of course, not to find manu factures, but to building materials such as iron and_cement. This attitude is quite justified since there can be no question about the superiority of those who have rubbed shoulders with the Russians of the past. It will be well worth watching how far the Iranian government will succeed in replacing the existing Russian culture and skills by the new Iranian culture with its French veneer and the technical instruction now being given in government schools by German instructors. Less within the control of the government is the dependence of Azerbaijan on Russia for commercial prosperity. The natural flow of trade is northwards. The south takes little from Azerbaijan and offers little. At present the foreign trade of Russia is a government monopolv, and carried on by official departments. Iran has adopted a similar princi ple, and against the Russian trade agencies has set up large monopolistic concerns. Trade, instead of flowing freely, has been canalised and con trolled as to volume. Hundreds of merchants who formerly gained a livelihood from the trade with Russia, each tending his small individual streamlet, have been thrown out of business. Azerbaijan is poorer. in consequence. The people in trade in Azerbaijan deeply regret the elimi nation of the capitalists in Russia. They bitterly resent the measures which the Iranian government has in its turn considered necessary in the interests of this country’s foreign trade. Azerbaijan finds itself in the unhappy position of being crushed between the upper and the nether mill stones. It is generally believed that bad times will persist until trade again becomes free with Russia. Apart from her own trade, Russia offers a route for trade between Iran and western Europe. In his annual report on the trade of Resht in 1878, Mr. Consul Churchill, writing after Batoum had become Russian and speculating on the effects of a railway connecting the Black Sea with the Caspian, expressed the belief that trade with Europe would become mupn easier for Persia if only the Russians would not place impediments m the way. “As it is,” he went on, “the difficulties thrown in the way of the transit of merchandise through the Caucasus by the Russian customs authorities are so great that merchants in general trading with this country prefer sending their goods through Bagdad and Bushire.- If the recent 438(C) F&amp;PD172 conference about the Dardanelles showed that ^^t^l^autho' pH at IpDct certain principles of Tsarist policy, the Batoum customs autno rfties have given proof that they too have inherited the attitude of their nrodecesirs towards the transit trade. If the ancient route through Trebirond is modernised it will largely be because Iran feels the need of an alternative route to the sea. The Julfa-Batoum railway is cheapest, and St to be the quickest, but Russia appears far from willing to facilitate a transit trade in competition with her own The question arose in a discussion which I had with the manager of the National Bank about merchandise from England lying at Trebizond. . He was quite frank as to his preference for the Trebizond route, despite its natural difficulties He said 1 that one could never trust the Russians, that they were capable of raising obstacles to the passage of goods without warning and without sufficient cause. I have already reported a plan for improving railway services between the U. S. S. R. and this country whereby loaded trucks will be allowed to cross the frontier. This arrangement, it is thought, will soon come into force, but it will not benefit the transit trade if goods are still to be liable, as at present, to delay in the Batoum customs. The Russian Consular and trade officials form a large, but not a very impressive group. Some of them speak the local language, but hardly any have even the slightest knowledge of European languages, so that they necessarily remain aloof from other foreign Consuls. They are hardly less completely segregated from the Iranians, private as well as official. It is notorious that the owner of a small shop at the entrance to the Consu late-General is a police spy, and that all visits are reported. . Visitors of Iranian nationality are generally asked later to explain their business to the police. (b) Turkey. The people of Azerbaijan do not like the Turks. It is said that although they have been glad on occasion to have Russian troops come in and might even welcome them again, they would be united m resisting the Turks. The reason is that whereas the Russian invaders brought money with them ^nd generally created something, the lurks simply pillaged and destroyed. There is of course, a new Turkey just as there is a new Russia, but the change has not been for the better. Whereas Russia produced com munism. Turkey also has sponsored startling and obnoxious doctrines, more than that, Ataturk has clasped the hand of the Shah and, according to local belief, poisoned his mind with ideas subversive, of the established social order and obnoxious to good Moslems. Ataturk is considered to be the fons et origo of all such conceptions as the hatting of men, the unveiling of women, the discomfiture of the mollahs, with more threatening, such as the adoption of the Latin script and the Sunday as the weekly day of rest. Turcophiles are accordingly few, and limited to those who know Stambul or have agents there. It is nevertheless recognised locally that the official attitude to Turkey is one of closest friendship. If Ataturk’s failure to find time to repay the Shah’s visit has had a chilling effect, the officials do not show it.here. The Turkish Consulate has been favoured, above the others, by the military, for example, who attend Turkish receptions when they would excuse themselves from the receptions of other Consuls. As regards trade, the economy of Turkey is too similar_to that of Iran for any great flow of trade between the two countries. Turkey’s import ance consists in the route she offers through Trebizond. It is long and difficult, but already it is attracting some classes of goods solely because the authorities at Trebizond are more accommodating than those of Batoum, and more reliable, possibly because Turkey has everything to gain and nothing to lose by making the transit trade easy. If a railway is construct ed eventually, the route will become easier, cheaper and less liable to stoppage in winter. The Turks for their part are said to be building a173 line in the direction of Van, whence it will be continued to Bash Kaleh on the frontier, but this information requires confirmation. Local opinion Is T LT{: npathe V C the P ro P^ al to build a corresponding 5 railway on the lianian side of the frontier, tor reasons which will be discussed in tfie section dealing with internal affairs. oiscussea in (c) Iraq is the least important, so far as Azerbaijan is concerned of Iran s neighbours. Ihe frontier is virtually closed, while western Azerbai jan is treated as a military zone in whicii the presence, even as passing visitors, of foreigners is not welcomed. It is therefore difficult to obtain information as to what is happening along the frontier. So far as one can gather, there appears to be no important cause for. disagreement, territorial or tribal, although it is evident enough that no love is lost between the two countries Like individuals conscious of a low position in the social scale, they are excessively touchy on points of honour and each is anxious to find cause for feeling the superior. But while Iraqis and Iranis be little each other when possible and obstruct each other in minor ways, no evidence has been forthcoming of agressive propaganda on either side along the Azerbaijan frontier. The relations between the countries are normaL ly determined by what happens further south. Trade between Azerbaijan and Iraq appears to be very limited. Every year Iraq buys livestock from this area, but sends virtually nothing in exchange. The Rowanduz route is dead. Economically it cannot com pete with the routes to the Black Sea; politically it offers no attraction to the Iranian government. When the carriage of oil and benzine from the south was interrupted, regular traffic via Rowanduz came to an end, and it is now impossible to send goods from Syria, for example, to Tabriz via Rowanduz. They have to enter the country via Kermanshah. Smuggling until recently was serious over the Iraqi frontier into Azerbaijan. All sorts of articles were brought in, but the backbone of the traffic was sugar for the in-coming trip and silver for the out-going. Now the price of sugar has been lowered, from Mehabad to the frontier, to a figure at which the smuggler loses most of his profit while the smuggling outwards of silver appears to have stopped or dwindled to insignificance. At the same time the authorities have intensified their control, and so have, for the time being, apparently gained the upper hand over the smugglers. Pilgrims leave Azerbaijan for the holy places in Iraq as and when they can obtain passports from their own police. They have no complaints against their fellow-Moslems in Iraq; indeed many people think that the Iraqi government is now a much better upholder of the faith than the Iranian, and some said so freely when the excitement over the unveiling of women was at its height. The Iraqi Consul complains of being spied upon and indeed he probably is watched rather more attentively than the European Consuls, even if less closely than the Russian. He had to dismiss a gulam recently for showing the Consulate’s official mail to the police before delivering it. (d) Foreigners. Reacting violently from the weakness in face of foreign diplomacy shown by the last regime, the Shah is obviously resolved to repulse any attempt at foreign penetration, commercial or political. His attitude .is ; of course, reflected in the bearing of provincial officials. There appears indeed to be some system whereby provincial officials are, when in Tehran, keyed up to a suitable pitch of hauteur vis-a-vis foreign ers. It has been noted that newly-appointed officials, or officials who have just paid a visit to the capital (the chief of police, for example, who returned recently from such a visit) bring back a somewhat aggressive nense of dignity, and tend at first to use the £ ‘certainly not!” tone of voice; but that after a space they begin to relapse into their natural, easy-going courtesy, and to find it difficult again to say “No.” The official attitude towards foreigners is indeed not quite healthy or natural in Iranians. With the effort to wear a distant and superior manner goes an inner conviction of inferiority, and something approaching certainty that foreigners are secret ly amused. This explains the sensitiveness to foreign press opinions, the174 i • oil fnvcj of civilization, trains, cars, aeroplanes, hospitals 'a “o toth the anoety to pi; y at bemg Europeans, U, wear hats 'and doff them to ladtes unveiled and all decked out in temmme finery Th^average Iranian probates ^ 3 .^ person^on^a stage,^cUng pretty-pretty Clothes. They are not yet fn touch with European reality, and their imitation of us is accordingly artificial and roman ic. ' Time is the only cure, and the only way to meet these people is with understanding and a sense of humour, a readiness to meet them halfway bu“a step further. The worst possible, probably is to show obsequio usness or undue deference, as to their great discomfiture the French and Italians did to the incoming Kemalists at Smyrna m 1922. hoieigners who bear these principles in mind appear to escape unduly severe vexations but the obstacles to trade and the general suspiciousness effectively prevent, for the present, any individual foreigner whatever his nationality from acquiring any great influence either with the merchants or the officials, he U reatened to do so he would quickly, like any Kurdish chieftain, have his wine's clipped. Nevertheless the state is prepared to use the services of foreigners, but only as salaried employees, liable to dismissal The Iran of today is not a comfortable country for any but men of small calibre and obedient dispositions, whether they be foreign or native. _ Internal (1) Minorities .—{a.) Assyrians. There are comparatively few Assyrians in Tabriz and Eastern Azerbaijan, the main body being con centrated in western Azerbaijan, and especially around Rezaieh. It is said that possibly 50,000 fled when the Turks invaded that territory during the war and that perhaps 30,000 returned. Such as brought arms back with them have been disarmed. On the whole these people are by local standards, prosperous. Many of them possess houses or vineyards or some such stake in the country. They enjoy their possessions undisturbed by any political cr racial animosity. x\s regards religion, the Assyrians are not united. Many are Catho lics, mam Protestant and some Orthodox. As for politics, they do not appear to be politically minded as compared, for example, with the The\ have many relatives in the U. S. A. and until the slump of 1929 they received important remittances. This proof of greater wealth . in other countries, confirmed by the earnings of the menfolk in the Levies, by the lavish distribution of relief at the end of the war and, more recently, the concern shown for Assyrians at Geneva, have unsettled this minority and made it discontented with its prospects in Iran. This phase, pre sumably, will pass as they come to realise that for the mass of them there is no hope of translation to a better land. Meantime, although they are carefully watched and their movements controlled by the Iranian autho rities, they appear to be otherwise treated on a footing of equality with their Moslem neighbours. (b) Armenians. The territory south-east of Mount Ararat was former ly thickly populated with Armenians, but there are few of them now in the extreme north-west of Azerbaijan are along the Aras. They are dis persed through the two provinces and Tabriz contains, a strong colony, headed by the archbishop. They are found also in strength in Maragha, Mianduab and Pezaieh, while many of the Karadagh villages are Arme nian. Apart from a few rich families, the majority are of the peasant or artisan classes. They live peacefully and are not molested by the Moslems. They are eligible for service in government departments. The archbishop, supreme in his flock, is treated with respect by the authorities and appears to have successfully gained their confidence. His declarations, it is said, are accepted at their face value; he is an honoured guest at official recep tions. The Armenians have an aptitude for political intrigue. Here they are divided into two parties, Dashnag and Hinchag. The first is conserva- tbe and at present tends to concern itself with the culture of the race, its175 language and its schools. The archbishop is of this party. The second is more revolutionary. Some years ago it published a newspaper which favoured Bolshevism, but that has been suppressed, the leaders have gone to Russia and the party is quiescent. (c) White Russians. Of these there have been considerable numbers in Azerbaijan, but the Iranian authorities have consistently moved all but the long-established Russians to the south. These refugees appear to be assured of a ready market for the skill and knowledge, provided they are willing to keep away from the border region and to become Iranian sub jects. (d) Jews are few in Tabriz, no more than four or five families. Even these came originally from Rezaieh where, until the establishment of the national home for the Jews in Palestine, they lived some 200 families. That number has been reduced by migration to Palestine, how far is now known. The Jews do not attract undue attention. So far as is £nown, the autho rities are not in any way disposed to molest them. None of them is outstanding with wealth or influence. They are mostly merchants dealing in textiles in a smallish way, or silversmiths. The government’s policy towards these minorities is well-defined, and deserves, so far, to be called wise.. Obviously its first principle must be that no minority shall have the means of embarrassing the government politically and its second, that so far as possible and as quickly as may be, the people of other races within the state must be assimilated. The first principle has been firmly enforced. The minorities have been disarmed and prevented from maintaining active political organisations with newspapers or other means of carrying on an agressive policy. It is known that there are, among the Armenians, certain communists, but they are closely watched by the secret police, who are very efficient as spies. The archbishop, moreover, frowns on such as admit communistic sympa thies. For the time being, therefore, the minorities are all law-abiding, orderly and too respectful of the Shah’s power to contemplate political intrigue wdth Russia, even if she were disposed to play the traditional part of interfering on behalf of the Christians. So long as they so behave, the government shows no sign of giving Russia any pretext for interfer ence, and with very few reservations is prepared to treat the Christians as equals with their Moslem fellow-citizens. One approaches the subject of assimilation with suspicion. There is, however, no sign of any attempt to stamp out the traditions, languages, religions or culture of the minorities, that is, for practical purposes, of the Assyrians and the Armenians. These peoples supplied, during the war, good cause why the Moslems should suspect their loyalty and even take revenge, if so disposed. Actually, the Persians are, so far, treating them a good deal more leniently than England treated the Highlanders of Scotland, while of course there is nothing of the Turkish mentality towards Christian minorities here. The fact is recognised that Christians and Moslems lived peacefully side by side so long as there was no foreign inter ference. Even the killing, one of another, which took place during the war under Turkish and Russian influence, is partly redeemed by instances where Moslems sheltered Christians, and vice versa, in time of need. There is a great deal to say for the official policy of removing any foreigners who may be in a position to meddle with minorities, as for example the Americans, whose well-meant intervention west of the lake of Urumia at the end of the war gave some of the people the means of procuring arms. The government does, however, insist that the official language country is Persian, and it has imposed on all schools a curriculum ensures that the young shall learn it. The Armenians at first resisted, but acquiesced after their schools had been closed for some time, and t ey appear at present to enjoy reasonable opportunities for their own cultural development. The Assyrians do not appear to have resisted; as has been stated, they are less conscious of racial distinction, and less united, than the Armenians. 438(C) F&amp;PD176 As regards military service, the minorities serve in the ranks with the others and Ae Severer are readily selected for jobs requiring more than tte ordi^ry intelligence, which aUg the Moslems m ^ Some ho d commission/as doctors, etc,, m the non-combatant seyices, but tbe of regular combatant officer is monopolised by the Mosie . 2 Tribes —(a) Kurds. These comprise a number of tribes inhabiting to mountainous area along the Turkish and Iraqi frontiers^ Untd a er the war they were largely independent, armed, and capable o± causing a good d/al of trouble. They have raided Tabriz in times of weakness m Tehran. Encouraged by the Turks, Sunnis like themselves, they became formidable under the famous Ismail Agha (Sirnko) during the war ^upmg totowns west and south of Lake Urumia and usurping m that district the functions of Government. It is one of the present Shah’s most notable achievements that whereas none of his predecessors succeeded in taming the unruly Kurds one soldier can now, as people say, go out and bring in a hundred of them. Mis greatest success has been along the Turkish frontier where, m consequence of the concerted policy of the two governments, the Kurds have been unable to play the one off against the other, or to dodge back and forth across e frontier at will. In this area the tribes have been disarmed and they are resigned to inactivity for the time being. Along the Iraqi frontier e situation is different. The Iraqi Kurds have not been disarmed and those on this side have pleaded the necessity of having weapons for that reason. Nevertheless the first principle of policy, which is the same as with the minorities, has Teen applied to a considerable extent. Despite their arms, the Kurds of south Azerbaijan, Ardalan and Kurdistan have been weakened by the removal of leaders. Those, like Omar Khan for example, who are unwilling to submit completely, are either killed or, as in the case of the man just mentioned, imprisoned. Those who remain free have to wear the cloak of humility, as for example the leaders who, as reported m my diaries, waited on the pleasure of the general from Rezaieh inspected the frontier last April. Even they are now being moved out of their own districts and quartered in towns under the eye of a garrison commander. The registration of names and property, the maintenance of strong local garrisons, the imposition of military service wherever possible, all tend towards the application of this first principle that there shall be no political or military organisations within the state except those of the gov ernment. Fresh measures are still being devised. The Lutheran mission to the Kurds has been forced out of Mehabad. Recently the police warned the Iraqis west of Mehabad to quit, and although their Consul was able to have the order withdrawn, he has now received a reply from the Governor General of Western Azerbaijan which indicates that the incident is not closed. The Governor-General justifies the police order by section 16 of the law governing the entry and residence of foreigners, and implies that it will be enforced. The Turkish Consul fears that the 250 Turkish citizens who reside in the district between Ushnu and Senna will be required to move eventually, as well as the Iraqis. The consistency with which foreigners are being discouraged from residing in Kurdish territory is surely rather extreme if it is based merely on the fear that the thin scattering of uninfluential foreigners in Kurdish territories at present might stir the tribes to rebellion. One wonders whether perhaps some further move in the direction of weakening the tribal organisations is not being prepared, some measure which the government might not wish foreigners to observe. So much for the systematic destruction of the old order; there is now a little to say about reconstruction on a new foundation. According to report a certain Manassarian, a Russian Armenian, acquired under Russian protection considerable estates in the Turkish frontier zone. When the Tehran government became strong enough in these regions, it ousted Manassarian, despite Soviet protests, on the ground that a foreigner had no right to hold such property, paying Rails 600,000 as177 compensation. This land, it is said, is being sold gradually to nomad 80 as t0 Pm them down to the soil. It is supposed that this policy will be extended as and when the necessary resources are found. ^ f ^ sevans ' Tile of the Shahsevans is simpler than that of the Kurds since the only foreign power which might take their part is Kussia and Russia used them, so roughly in 1912 t^at they have 1 little reason to turn to her. The question is almost a purely internal one. This tribe has been described on occasion as the most powerful in Persia. Properly speaking, of course, it is a loose federation of many small tribes, who have frequently found themselves united into a strong force by common enmity towards the central government. Highway robbery and holding to ransom were everyday trades. That has been completely stopped, and while it is difficult to obtain information, the fact that security is perfect on the roads running through their territory and that no incidents are reported suggests they have been completely subju gated by the central government. As regards assimilation, this is being attempted as with the others. I have recorded in my diaries the attempt, suspended for the moment but by no means abandoned, to induce the nomad tribes to settle in houses instead of in moving tents, and to have themselves registered and their flocks numbered. It appears that a good deal of land is available for settlement, while the proposed irrigation of the Moghan steppe on the Iranian side of the border is intended to provide more. -(c) Karadaghis. The inhabitants of the Karadagh, capital Ahar, do not constitute a definite tribe. Intermixed with the Moslems are many Armenians. Rut the relative inaccessibility of the mountainous region they inhabit has given them a certain separate and common independence in the past and local leaders have on occasion raised forces which have played important parts in the politics of Persia. The last occasion was when the central government used them against the Kurd Ismail Khan, and in those operations the Karadaghi leader Amir Arshad was killed- He left behind him a brother, Sardar Ashair, but he is of poorish quality as a leader and has no power now. The Shah’s strong arm rules throughout the district and there is no talk now of Karadaghi horsemen; the mountaineers are now seem by Tabrizis as their cafish country cousins, who walk their mounts into town with loads of charcoal. 3. Moslems .—There remains the Moslem core of the population. It is considered to be somewhat more fanatical, more resolute in its hold on tradition than the people of the south. Indeed the Azerbaijani believes, with some justification, that in personal physique, in business and in warfare, he is a sounder sharper and braver man than the Persian of the south. The Tehrani, and the pure Persian in general, relying on a superior culture, affect a condenscension towards the uncouth, north. This awareness of a difference in speech and culture is, in.the ordinary way, of little importance politically; it is probably less marked than was the difference between England and the north of Scotland two hundred years ago, but England was fortunate in that France was much further away from.Scotland than Russia is from Azerbaijan. While there is no indica tion that Russia is disposed to interfere at present, there are indications, and it is the common belief, that the Shah is mistrustful of the loyalty of Azerbaijan. The key positions are always filled by officials from the south; the most minute matter is referred to Tehran and the people feel that spies are more numerous here than elsewhere, and the control of anairs harsher than elsewhere, all because of Russia. Nevertheless the Shah’s supremacy is complete throughout this frontier district. The story told of his first visit to Rezaieh illustrates how fiercely he is resolved to remain supreme. In the time of Shah Muzaffar-ud-Dm, so the tale goes, a khan of Rezaieh set out for Meshed, and was received by the Shah en route. He praised the king, spoke of the love ^nd loyalty felt for him in Urumteh, then a district weeks distant from Tehran and often178 unruly, and went on to say that he was on his way to Meshed to pray at the shrine that His Majesty might live long in the lore and loyalty ks subjects. This was music in the Shah s ears, an , i 1 ^^ The oriental interlude by giving handsome presents to the tactful khan, the story became traditional. 'As Riza Shah strode along the lines of soldiers, respectful citizens, a mollah of Rezaieh, thinking to compel circumstance to his advantage, stepped forward and halted the r 0 ^ 1 ,,P arty M ff repetition of the sentiments which had been used so profitably on Muzaflar- ud-Din. He had reached the passage when he understock to pray tor perpetual love and loyalty of the Shah’s subjects, when the Shah, bursting with rage and impatience, shouted “Show me one subject who isn t oy , and I shall pull him to pieces!” and his hands gestured m keeping with his words. The mollah, abashed and terrified, fled. As the Shah °a nnH rpnnvprp.rl himself somewhat, he demanded: “Who was that old too . This serves also to illustrate how far Persia has changed since the days of the feeble Muzaffar-ul-Din. The Shah has, it would seem a distaste and disdain for the mollahs as a class and for their old-womanish nonsense, and he appears to dislike them above all for their former political innuence. Strong as that was in Azerbaijan until a few years ago, he has greatly weakened it. He has reduced their numbers and prescribed their duties. While there has not been here any exhibition of servility such as newspapers report on the part of some mollahs in the south in the matter of adopting hats and unveiling, the broad fact remains that the mollahs have been unable to give the people an effective lead in resistance of such innovations and have therefore quite lost their traditional power to nullify the pro gressive measures of the government. The old fight between church and state has been fought and, this time, decisively won by the state. Politically supreme and with the old enemies of progress powerless to oppose, the Shah has undertaken the social and economic regeneration of the people with, as a corollary, the material re-equipment of the country. The measures of social reform are well-knowij and general through the country. Briefly, they are based on the acceptance of western superiority and for the first time a Moslem ruling class is humbling itself in presence of its Christian minorities by adopting their social manners. The men now wear European dress; the women are not effectively unveiled, but the first and greatest step has been taken in the discarding of the chaddar. The crop of receptions and parties which Tehran commanded the local officials to stage earlier in the year has passed, and there is no sign of that sort of thing becoming general yet awhile; but the younger people of both sexes are prepared to mingle in European fashion and again, the first step towards a new social order has been taken. More important than drilling adults in the technique of the afternoon tea-party is the education of the young. They are being prepared for a bread with the traditions of their fathers and there is no reason to suppose that they will refuse the invitation to move forwards with the promise of new and better things. New and in some cases fine school buildings are being erected at various points through out the northern provinces. The French curriculum has been adopted. Technical instruction is being given and all pupils are made to play games, to march and drill and generally to take themselves seriously as future citizens. All are being taught Persian and there are to be schools in which even the adults may learn Persian. Matters of health are not being neglected. The government is establishing new hospitals, while the local Red Lion committees have provided hospitals and clinics in many towns. X-ray and other modern equipment has been purchased from Germany at the cost of thousands of pounds. In theory, preparations are being made to treat all sorts of diseases in all classes of the population. A proper leper village has just been completed and promises the end of a long standing scandal,As regards the economic sphere, the range of official control and 1 guidance is very wide. The main divisions are agriculture, local industry and foreign trade. The task of land registration has been begun, and the Doomsday Book is being written. There are difficulties necessarily in a country where few records have been kept, but the work will doubtless go on and provide a new basis of land ownership. It may be mentioned that in general the government appears to favour the claim of the small- holder as against the big landowner in such disputes as arise over title. Taxation methods have been changed and for the old payment of a part of the produce through the landlord has been substituted a uniform tax of 3 per cent, of the value of agricultural produce sold. The underlying principle is the same as may be traced through all the Shah’s activities, the elimination of all sugar refinery there, and the extended area under cotton in the Ma district. Branches of the Agricultural Bank have been established m various towns, and considerable sums advanced to the farming classes. So far there do not appear to have been any importation of new stock for breeding purposes into Azerbaijan, but numbers of horses have passed through from Europe, indicating that the need for purchase of animals abroad has been recognised. Now there is talk of a commission, or commis sions, to be formed from the landowjng class who are to look into the possibilities of improving methods of agriculture, of bettering the breeds or domestic animals, and of conserving water for irrigation purposes. Most important, reforestation is to be attempted. Large companies have already been formed to ensure the proper preparation of agricultural produce for sale, and to market it, notably m the case of dried ±rui s, abroad. Grain silos are being built to provide proper storage for a suffic e reserve of grain to tide the country over bad harvests. As regards local industry, the government appears to favour the tra nsi- tion from handcrafts to machinery. The ancient carpet industry is already showing the effects of the new pressure to produce at a higher rate Mak are tending' to concentrate on a quick overturn of capital by p Uon of Zfe but inferior, rugs at\ higher rate.

It is therefore little wonder that merchants should find their difficulties greatly increased or tnat some, m he extreme of their resentment and foreboding, should withdraw from trade and conserve their capital in the hope that the present is no more than a passing phase leading either to a timely modification or, lailmg that, to disaster which will clear the field for a fresh start. Intimately linked with the question of foreign trade are communica tions and outlets to the sea. Internally the country has leapt in a decade from pack-horses and tracks, to camions and roads wonderfully good in all the circumstances and permitting of quite high speeds. Motor-omnibuses have begun to ply along the main roads, and one of the consequences of their introduction is the vastly increased mobility of labour. The Russian-built railway which connects Tabriz with the frontier and with Sharaf-Khane on the lake is a losing concern if local reports are to be believed. Two trains, mixed passenger and goods, are run in each direction weekly, covering the eighty miles in seven hours on good days. When the dried fruit crop is being exported, the trains are heavy for a short season, but normally the movement of goods is slight. Cement, iron, sugar and mineral oils come in regularly from Russia, but the movement northwards may be limited for weeks on end to returning empties, with practically no passengers. The Trebizond route competes for the exports such as carpets, where value is high relative to weight and bulk. In these circumstances, local opinion mocks at the talk of another rail way to link Sharaf-Khane with Dilman and the proposed Turkish railhead at 'Rash Kaleh. It is asked where the traffic is to come from, and it is urged that better roads and more lorries would meet the needs of the country at less cost while giving greater elasticity. The whole subject of railroad construction is highly unpopular, the common attitude being that the railway now under construction in the south is no more than a fad of the Shah’s, an undertaking which will never earn the money which is being poured into it. But it is quite clear that local opinion will not be consulted and there are indications that the railway towards Turkey is being serious ly considered; the new repair sheds at Tabriz are designed to handle a great deal more work than is necessary at present for the maintenance of the existing rolling stock. General Survey .—I have so far dealt with conditions external and internal and shown that they are being modified by an active and progres sive policy in all the three spheres, political, social and economic. It is necessary, in any analysis of that policy and its efiects, to concentrate on the distance covered rather than the distance still to cover before the coun try is brought up to European standards if one is to avoid facile and superficial condemnation. me questions which must be answered, so far as possible, are : Whence does this urge for progress arise? How are is it genuine to date, how far spurious? How far is it likely to carry the country? Taking the political sphere first, one has to admit a very great achievement in the complete pacification of Azerbaijan. The strength of v e - a ^’ ^u.lessly used, has removed all possible enemies, but it has not degenerated into merely vengeful persecution of minorities or tribes as such. On the contrary, as its means permit, the government appears anxious to give non-national and nomad elements the means of becoming s^tHnl C wHeb S tW 80 ^ ar . f as , P os _ slb ? e within the natural and cultural mtin vhich they have inherited. It is perfectly true that if the Shah but e everv ! ms 4 TvL r f ieS T ight tl a 8 ain , tribesmen reassemble; e A Tt k tr f/tW rende f t he °f control by future Shah’s more ea.y. It is true that some of the discontented say they prefer the old mo&gt;est e aUon e on ^ h t0 ^ toVe^ShaUvans to Xh^fredsneh an o^u^ 7 ’.-^ were at ^st making profits d uoh an out!a y man y tlme s over; but they do not mean this181 really. ISo one can deny that the security now prevailing throughout lion 1 as’^ whole COndltl0n of the S reatest for the life of the popula- Vs hile discipline has been thus successfully imposed from above there has been no attempt so far to develop self-discipline or co-operation, among the people as a whole. In so far as civics are ‘The science. ... of the !I ? public mind of the will for constructive, intelligent and healtnlui participation in the work which governments, local and national are empowered by the people to perform. . .” they are an entirely neglected science m this part of the country. Nobody here takes seriously the representative capacity of the Majlis; the members are the creatures of the - .an, it is believed. Local government amounts to very little; the munici pal council is locally elected, as is the Chamber of Commerce, but neither has the power to deal with any by the matters of simple routine; the Governors-General, and the Chiefs of Police, are nominated by Tehran, and through them every matter of the slightest importance is referred to the ministries in the Capital. The katkhudas in the villages are nominat ed by the sub-governors. Everything depends directlv on the government, and the government is nothing and nobody but the Shah in the minds of the people. He therefore bears all the odium for hard times and the dis comforts caused by the transition to newer ways and methods. No scape goat minister will be allowed by opinion in, Azerbaijan at all events to carry away the blame for mistakes or disaster, if the pessimists are justified. Apologists might well argue that any form of government by the peo ple would still be unsaie in a country where until recently there existed many loyalties in conflict with the loyalty due to the central government. Even more forcible would be the argument that a civil service such as Iran possesses is neither trustworthy enough nor honest enough to carry out reforms without close supervision from Tehran. The Shah is indeed pitifully short of men both reliable and sufficiently educated to serve his purposes, as is evidenced by the frequency with which erring officials are forgiven and given further employment, provided, of course, that the offence was not of a political nature. The inadequacy of the official classes may explain why the Shah has been much more successful in dealing with minorities and tribes than with Moslems, with matters political than with matters social and economic. It appears moreover to be a fact that the standard of honesty among officials has become lower these two or three years. Many of them are said to be daring practices which they thought too dangerous in the Shah’s first years in power. They have been encour aged by the Shah’s own seizure of great wealth, and by the light punish ments inflicted for corruption. A critical examination of progress in the social sphere reveals that much of it is the thinnest veneer. The unveiling of women must have some value as suggesting to them that they are capable of more useful lives, but no adequate attempt is being made to educate them for such lives. The French curriculum is far ahead of what pupils here can tackle with success. Girls of tender years are struggling with the differ ential calculus when they ought to be learning the many things which their mothers cannot teach—simple hygiene, some rules of health which might save many of the children who die from ignorance or neglect, how to sew, and how to cook. The companies of boy scouts and girl guides formed some months ago have so far learned nothing but how to salute in uniform. In the same way it must be said that the details of new hospitals and of provision for the sick, which read well in the papers and doubtless flatter official self complacency a great deal, represent a very superficial attempt to deal with the problem of public health. The country could afford to lose all those unfortunates whom the doctors and hospitals may save for a few years if a tenth of the children who are denied by neglect and ignorance the chance to live were saved for the country. It is all so superficial. The one comfort is that these showy attempts at progress do reveal a realisation of the need for improvement, and ©ne may hope that the next generation182 will improve on them by getting to the ro^s o f the Problem. e ““?' mics, some attempt will be made to analyse the progress made in sphere in a separate report. ^ _ Nothing in the attitude of the people of Azerbaijan suggests approval of this reforming zeal. The measures are imposed from above, seldom, 11 ever, invited by the people. The question as to how far and ^ow long progress can continue depends in the first instance on °J ° ^ d lives It is probably perfectly safe to state that so long as he lives and retains the use of his faculties, there will be no challenge to his supremacy, nor any effective opposition to whatever reforms his government may decree The question of utmost interest is: What are the qualities of his son ? People here are not impressed by the new found royalty of Rl ? a jfbah. career in Azerbaijan is perfectly well known; and so there is no dispos- tion to accept his son as enjoying any divine right of succession. ' attempts to popularise the young man, the accounts of his skill at games, or his public duties and his pictures arouse no enthusiasm. It is said that comment in private circles is somewhat mocking, and that the gossip abou him is not always complimentary. His succession will not be automatically smooth, and unless he is well blooded by his father beforehand m t e methods of ruling which he has used so effectively so far, he may, and many people hope he will, disappear in a crisis which will sweep away most of the hated reforms of the Shah. Given long life, the Shan may indeed see better economic conditions in the. world at large, and conse quently greater prosperity in this country. He may live to point the moral that those who condemn him now by their hatred have no right to judge a work which is doubtless little more than begun. If, for example, the appointment of German surveyors to map out the mineral resources of the country result in a serious attempt to develop the great riches of the Karadagh, then Tabriz become the Lille of Iran, and these hard times be forgotten in a period of prosperity. The Shah’s railways would then have a sufficiency of freight to justify their construction; the idle merchants would find ample scope for their capital and their enterprise; the peasants would find a good market for their produce. That may come, but mean time there is hardly a single class or trade enjoying prosperity. The bulk of the population is as badly housed, as ill-nourished and poorly clad as it was before Riza Khan became Shah; many think their conditions are worse and very few are capable of the long view which would enable them to see any promise ii\ the future. It is therefore no exaggeration to say that the Shah is passing through a phase of intense unpopularity. If any one western idea is more incapable than another of being understood and adopted by the people of Azerbaijan, it probably is that democratic con ception that a king should rule in the hearts of his people.

Similarly the Governor of Abadan has been dismissed, though it is understood that he may be given another post, for being so weak as to allow the judge to close the Courts and forward a complaint to Tehran. 3.

( 101 ) Despatch from British Legation, Tehran, to the Right Honourable, Anthony Eden M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc., the Foreign Office, No. 504-E., DATED THE 13TH NOVEMBER 1936. With reference to Sir Reginald Hoare’s despatch No. 434-E of 22nd September 1934 (S. No. 113 of F. No. l-N-734), I have the honour to report that a bill was submitted to the Majlis on November 3rd, and ap proved on November 9th, increasing the maximum issue of bank notes from 800,000,000 rials (£10,000,000) to 1,176,163,600 rials (£14,702,045). The metallic cover against these notes is to remain at 60 per cent. 2. In introducing the measure the Minister of Finance said that the rapid industrial and commercial developments in the country had created a demand for bank notes which was in excess of the present supply. All the additional notes for which authorisation was requested would not be put into circulation at once, but it was cheaper to have the whole supply printed at once. The actual market value of the metallic reserves was about 120 million rials (£1,500,000) more than their book value, but it was not intended to change the valuation. As further developments would no doubt make the existing reserves insufficient to maintain the legal 60 per cent cover, the Government had a plan already in operation for increasing its gold reserves. The Minister did not explain what this plan was, but in view of the shortage of foreign exchange and increasing commitments, the only possibility which occurs to me is that of purchasing as much gold as possible internally by means of some of the notes now being printed. 3. The expansion of the note circulation in Iran has been, to say the least, rapid. By the law of March 13th 1932 the maximum note issue was fixed at 340 million rials (£4,250,000 at present rates of exchange) and the metallic cover was to be 100 per cent. A currency law passed on beptem- ber 11 th 1934 increased the maximum issue to 800 million rials (£10 000.000) with a reserve against worn notes of a further 300 million rials’(£3,750,000) and a reduction of the metallic cover to 60 per cent. No opportunity has been lost of pointing to the fact that the metallic cover, until fairly recently, was in fact 90 to 100 per cent, of the notes ^ circula tion; that happv situation has now changed to such an extent that the acquisition of a further supply of gold has to be contemplated m order to nvnntain the statutory 60 per cent cover. Notes actually m circulation, ^rejxjiled k* my desjiatch No. 490-E of 30th October last, had already reached 723,362,050 rials on October 7th 1936. 4 It is difficult for me to judge whether an e ^“ si ° n ° f t ?° te f . n &lt; ;!J?' tion on this scale is justified by the undoubted addition to the count y resources in the shape of the railway and new industrial concerns tog th with the needs of the large-scale commercial operations which have to financed by the new monopoly companies. Signs are not lacking t 438(C) F&amp;PDincreasing supply of bank notes, coupled with the severe exchange restric tions, is being accompanied by a steady fall in the purchasing power ol the rial. I shall not fail to inform you further should this tendency show signs of accelerating. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (unnumbered), to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India No. 247 and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad No. 95. ( 102 ) Letter from British Legation, Tehran, to the Iranian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, No. 330/^/36, dated 15th October 1936. (Copies to :— j Foreign Office, No. 464. India, No. 236. Bushire, No. 74. Kerman, No. 28. Khorassan, No. 93.) As no doubt you know, on the 27th April last (7th Ordibehesht, 1315), Monsieur Motamedy spoke to me about the desire of the Imperial Govern ment to develop co-operation with neighbouring countries for preventive measures against locusts, and said that they would like to know what, in the view of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, would be the most effective method of achieving this end. Monsieur Motamedy’s enquiry was referred to London, and has since received thorough considera tion by the Economic Advisory Council, the body which, among many other tasks, advises His Majesty's Government on all questions affecting anti locusts measures. A reply has now been received from the Foreign Office informing us of the recommendations of the Council, which may be taken to be those of His Majesty’s Government and which are embodied in the following paragraphs. 2 . According to the Council’s opinion the locusts which are of economic importance to Iran belong to two species differing widely from one another both in their distribution and habits. 3. The first of these species is the Moroccan Locust. Dociostaurus maroccanus (Ihunberg), which in Iran is confined to the hilly provinces in the north. The Council understand that in dealing with this particular species a measure of international co-operation has already been established by the Iranian Government with the Government of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics. 4. The second locust species of great importance to Iran is the Desert Locust, Schistocerca cjregaria (Forskal), known in Iran as the Sea Locust malakh-i-daria i . As regards this species, far reaching international investigations have been in progress since the year 1929. In accordance with resolutions adopted by successive international locust conferences, these investigations have been placed under the general supervision of the Imperial Institute of Entomology, which has been recognised as the inter national centre for anti-locust research by the majority of countries in Africa and Western Asia liable to invasion by this species of locust. 5. These countries give active support to the international centre by supply mg it with regular reports on the activities and movements of the Pesert Locust within their borders. In the information accumulated bv the international centre there has, however, been a conspicuous gap as re- cards Iran since renorfs have not been communicated to the centre by the Iranian Government.185 6. Sucli data as are available in the face of this limitation suggest in tne first place that, although swarms of the Desert Locust overrun periodi cally the greater part of Iran, the invasions are usually first observed in the extreme south of that country. Field researches on the Mekran coast of British Baluchistan, organised by the Government of India, indicate that certain coastal areas of Baluchistan lying within the borders of India should be regarded as centres from which these invasions may originate.; The evidence collected by the entomologists of the Government of India suggests, however, that similar conditions may occur also further westward along the coasts of Iranian Baluchistan. In order to define these danger zones more precisely, it would be necessary for a special survey of these coasts to be undertaken by specially qualified entomologists. The urgent need for such a survey was recognised at the Fourth International Locust Conference held in Cairo in April last (Farvardine Ordibehesht, 1314). The conference adopted a resolution (Resolution 16, a copy of which is en closed herewith) urging the Government of Iran to organise the survey of the coastal areas of the Arabiah Sea and of the Persian Gulf. 7. The evidence accumulated at the international centre suggests that some of the swarms invading Iran may originate in the Arabian peninsula, more particularly in Oman and the eastern portions of Saudi Arabia. Since no entomologists are stationed in this area, it is hoped that it will be possible for special steps to be taken to organise field investigations during the next winter with a view to discovering the original sources of the invasions m question. Similar investigations are now in progress on the southern coasts of Arabia from which also it is possible that swarms arise which ultimately migrate into Iran. Investigations of this type undertaken by the inter national centre are carried out for the common benefit of all the countries concerned. They are supported financially by a considerable number of these countries but the results are made available to every country subject to invasion by this locust irrespective of the question ^ hefcl \ er , or p Governments have contributed towards the cost. It is ^ Mtiraal Armuents concerned will come to realise the importance of this international work and that they will assist in it by furnishing to the international centie information on the movements of locusts within their horde s. 8 The investigations outlined above form part of the comprehensive y. lue i &amp; ^ of the four international locust confer- auti-iocust plan approved by on h of f locust invasions by the discovery, ences. This plan aims at me p d , the constant supervision of the original ” “l ag^ment that'f all such areas could be of such areab.

Arabia with a view to reciprocal warnings o imp , likely the Council are of the opinion that such agreements ^ to prove of much practical value except m the case of that sug^s the Government of India. The Council base this view “ n of knv rperarHs Afghanistan there is no reason to suspect the existence ot y ongmal m.tbreak area of the Desert Locust in that country since the inva sions by that locust to which Afghanistan is periodically subject are due not to swarms bred in that country but to swarms entering from the south As regards Saudi Arabia, it should be observed that no °“ olo S loal tion of any kind exists in that country. No agreement between that country and the Iranian Government would, therefore, offer any guarantee o f s?™' ritv to Iran. The Council feel, however, that on general grounds it mi B ht be helpful if the Iranian Government were to enter into correspondence with the Saudi Arabian Government on the locust question for such corre spondence would at least serve to bring once more to the notice of that Cov- ernment the importance of the locust problem not only to Saudi Arabi itsef but to the other countries of Western Asia. 10 . You will see that the action suggested by the Council is briefly as follows:— , . (a) A survey of the whole southern coast of Iran, to be carried out by an entomologist with the specialised training required tor investigations into locust problems. If the Imperial Govern- anent have not already at their disposal an entomologist the requisite qualifications, His Majesty s Government would be happy to assist them by suggesting the name of a suitable entomologist who could be employed under a contract to carry out this survey, which, I understand, would require a year s work. Alternatively the Government of India, if the Iranian Government so desired, would be glad to detail one of their ^entomologists to carry out the work in active co-operation with (b) The second step suggested by the Council is that the. Imperial Government should join the majority of countries in Africa and Western Asia, liable to invasions by locusts, in recognis ing as the international centre for anti-locust research the Imperial Institute of Entomology, London. From what Mon sieur Motamody said to me about the Locust Office at .Damas cus I gathered that the Imperial Government were inclined to think that not much is to be gained by relying primarily on a central locust organisation, and that they prefer bilateral agreements with their neighbours for anti-locust measures.: The Council, however, point out that Monsieur Motamedy must have been under some misapprehension in regard to the constitution and functions of the Locust Office at Damascus. It appears that international locust conferences are in no way responsible for the establishment of this body, the status of which has never been discussed at these conferences. The Damascus Office is purely a regional body for the exchange of information on the locust problem between the countries of Western Asia and the Council understand that in practice it has never succeeded in providing an effective service to these countries. As a result the majority of the Governments concerned find it more advantageous to send their reports on locusts direct to the international centre. The Council feel confident that the Imperial Government would find that sub stantial practical advantages would result if they were to recognise the Imoerial Institute of Entomology as the inter national centre for locust research. Such recognition wouldimpose no obligation on the Imperial Government beyond that ot furnishing to the international centre regular information on the appearance and movement of locusts m Iran. For its part the international centre would transmit regularly to the Iranian authorities all information about locusts in neighbour ing countries that would be of practical value to that Govern ment. In addition the centre would hold itself available to offer advice on any matters concerned with locust control which the Imperial Government might from time to time care to raise. (c) Finally the Council think that it would be useful for the Imperial Government to conclude an agreement about anti-locust mea sures with the Government of India, and also to enter into correspondence with the Government of Saudi Arabia on the subject. His Majesty’s Legation are not yet in receipt of the detailed views of the Government of India but we know that the latter welcome the idea of co-operation and have indeed recently furnished the Iranian Consul-General in Delhi with certain information regarding the movement of locusts. I have no doubt that they will give any proposal for an agree ment their most sympathetic consideration. 11 . In conclusion may I say that I am sure that His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Government of India will be only too happy to co-operate with the Imperial Government in this matter in every practicable way. I know that both Governments welcome the suggestion made by Monsieur Mota- medy that the Imperial Government and they might co-operate in this sphere to the mutual advantage of all three and also of other countries that suffer from locusts. 12 . I shall be grateful if you would let me know in due course the views of the Imperial Government on the suggestions made by the Economic Ad visory Council and summarised in paragraph 10 above. If, after studving the contents of this letter, you would care to discuss the question further with me, I am of course at your disposal at any time convenient to you. (Signed^ A. C.

[With reference to my despatch No. 39 of the 4th July last, I transmit to you herewith a copy ot a letter from the Director-General of the Ministry for foreign Aftairs from which you will observe that the Iranian Govern- ment have raised no objection to the distribution by His Majesty’s Vice- Consul at Khorramshahr of the remaining assets of the bankrupt estate of Mr. Sequiera. 2 . You should therefore now instruct Captain Bazalgette to proceed e j W1 ^ h the dlstnbutio11 to the creditors of the sums available, and should draw his attention to the instructions contained in the last paragraph of the despatch from the Foreign Office No. 221 of the 19th May, a copy of which was enclosed in my despatch under reference. I consider that as the Persian Government have agreed to the distribution “in the same way as formerly there is no objection to the payment of the sums due to creditors now resident outside Persia and the distribution need not therefore be con fined to those creditors still resident in this country. In view of the ex change restrictions, the small payments due in India will probably be most conveniently made by arrangement with the Government of India, if neces sary, with the assistance of the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf., Payments in this country can be most easily madb by selling the rupees in deposit at the Imperial Bank and making the payment in rials. I do not know to whom Captain Bazalgette would propose to make the payment due to the “Italian Consul”. If he thinks that it should be made through His Majesty’s Legation to the Italian Legation in Tehran, full information should be given to His Majesty’s Legation regarding the debt. In all cases I leave to you and to Captain Bazalgette full discretion to make the payments in the manner you think most desirable. You should not hesitate to refer to His Majesty’s Legation for assistance if you experi ence any difficulty in distributing the sum available, and you should furnish His Majesty’s Legation in due course a report of the action taken in accord ance with the instructions contained in this despatch. 3 . I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (No. 439). Sub-enclosure to S. No. 105.

My Dear Charge d’Affaires, While thanking you for the information contained in your Note No. 313/4/36 of Tir 13th (July 4th, 1936), I have the honour to state that there is no objection as to the payment of the sum of money available at the Vice- Consulate at Khurramshahr to the creditors in the same way as previously and that the competent quarters of the Imperial Government do not consider that this action alone would be of a judicial nature. Yours sincerely, (Signed) A. SUHEILI.(E.-6862/405/34) (223/15/36).

Monsieur Matine Daftary has been in effect running the Ministry of Justice for some considerable time. He is young and active, and is also very friendly, and has often been helpful to His Majesty’s Legation. His appointment in the place of Monsieur Sadr, an ineffective nonentity, who looked what he was, a mullah of the old brigade, disguised in modern dress, is decidedly to be welcomed. .&lt;&gt; GirD -433(8) F&amp;PD-S 2~ 4l.l2jII-30,L£&gt; Despatch from British Legation, Tehran, to His Majesty’s Principae Secre tary of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade, dated the 2Lst December 1935.

As instructed in 3 r our despatch No. 446 (K.-9551|329|234) of the 4th September I enquired what price the Iranian Government would he prepared to give for the Hamadan Consulate property and have now received a reply that they will offer about Rials two hundred thousand (two thousand three hnndied and twenty-five pounds). 2. The enclosed copy of a report by Mr. Gault made after a visit to Hamac an on October 23rd, bears on this question. 3.

Enclosure I to Serial No. (2). Enclosure No. Kerman shah, 3 in Mr. Acting Consul Gault r s Despatch No. November 2nd, 1935, to His Majesty’s Minister at 34, DATED) Tehran.. Pinnated sale of Consulate Property to Iranian Governments See despatch No. 16 of June 26th, 1935. I was told by the Property Agent that on the. arrival of the Prime Minister and his party in Hamadan on their way to Tehran after the. opening of the Kermanshah Petroleum refinery they expressed a desire to see the Consulate property. The Property Agent showed them round at the request of the Governor of Hamadan* and was subsequently told by the latter that the Minister of Finance, Davar, had intimated that if the Governor wanted am extra house he must build it himself and not buy what had been built by a foreign Govern ment. Against this the Property Agent told me on October 29th that that morning he had been asked by the Director of the Finance Department if he knew what price the British Government was asking for the property. It may be of interest in this connection to state that, during my visit, I was • informed by the Manager of the Ottoman Bank in Hamadan that, though there are several properties similar to the Consulate for safe in Hamadan, the real estate market had improved somewhat in the course of the last month or two owing to the activities of Armenians. The fact that the Ottoman Bank is closing down entirely in Hamadan at the end of this year will presumably mean that the Manager’s house which adjoins the Vice-Consulate will eventually eome on the market too., which might have some effect on the position as regards the. sale of the Vice-Consulate itself. (3) ' Despatch from H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Right Honourable Anthony' Eden, M.C., M.P^ etc., etc., etc.. Foreign Office, No. 576-E., dated the: 28th December 1935. / . y ' . . With reference to my telegram of 27th December, No. 395,1 have the honour to inform you that the French text of the “ Convention sur les paiements entre rAllemagne et PIran en date du 30 octobre, 1935 yy was published in “ Le Journal de Teheran Tr of 22nd December. 2 . A copy of this text was furnished to me on the 24th December by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who also communicated copies of six letters, exchanged at the time of signature at Berlin. I now have the honour to transmit to you herewith the text of the Convention and of these letters. 3. The text of the regulations issued in supplement of the Convention has so far only been published in the vernacular and no official copy of the French text has ap yet been furnished. 4. If would appear from Article 17 of the Convention that as no certificates of exports have to be presented with applications for import licences, imports from Germany will benefit to the extent of the cost of export certificates (fifteen per centum) and also inasmuch as, presumably, imports to the full value of the exports may be imported. Other countries would still obtain an import licence to the value of eighy-five per centum only of the export certificate. 5. As, so far as is known, the arrangement with Germany is not of as binding a charact 3 r in respect of actual exchange of specified goods subject to a special quota list, as in the case of the Soviet Union, Germany has been accorded preferential treatment and countries whose treaties include the most-favoured nation clause have a good case to protest against the discrimination. 6 I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade [ ) 0 .

Enclosure 11 to Serial No. (4). Letter fr'm Haji Khan, Tehran, addressed to His Majesty’s Legation, Tehran, (received 7th December 1935.) I, the undersigned, Haji Khan, the son of late Nazer Ghulam Hussein Khan who was fi rmerly Prime Minister and Treasurer of Amir Shir Ali Khan of Afghanistan beg leave to state the following :— When a gold mine was discovered at Kandahar, Afghanistan, troops were sent by the British Government to fight with Amir Shir Ali Khan who was, after some time, orrested and deported to India. As the British Government were assured of my father’s honesty and integrity they re-instated him in his former job as Treasurer. After some time the British Government handed over Afghanistan Amir Abdur Rahman Khan who, being in hostile relations with the officials ef Amir Shir Ali Khan, took an inimical attitude against these officials. My father was, therefore, compelled to obtain pemfission from the British Government and proceeded to Meshed leaving behind him a large amount of property wo-Hi over a million (Tomans ?) in Afghanistan which still exist there. The said property were lost seemingly by the unfavourable attitude of the Amir of Afghanistan, but actually through the lack of attention of the British Governme it. My father has died since some time ago leaving me and my large family in a miserable situation of living. I had for some time done the job of a tailor which job I had to give up as I could not afford to buy the requisites. Now I am working for the last three months in H. R. H. the Valiah’s Orphanage as a nurse with a scanty pay. # I shall, therefore, be highly grateful if you would take into consideration the loyal and sincere services of my late father, the fact that he lost all his property while in the service of the British Government, and also my miserable situation and to give me either a job with sufficient pay to enable me to assure my liveli hood or a financial help sor that I may buy some tailoring requisites and resume my job as a tailor. Then I shall also do tailoring for the Legation. (5) Memorandum from the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, No. X.-80491800(503, dated the 17th December 1936.

With reference to Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen's despatch No. 425 of 3rd October last, I have the honour to inform you that an article in “ Le Journal de Teheran ' of 9th September last under the heading “ Irano-German Relations ” mentioned a dinner offered by the “ Deutsche-Orient Verein ” to the Iranian Minister at Berlin and the Iranian Mission visiting the country. The Presi dent of the Association, Dr. Reyes, made a speech anent the negotiations for the commercial convention which was about to be signed. 2 . I have the honour to transmit, herewith, a summary of an article published in the “ Etela’at of 2t0h November which throws some light on the “ Deutsche-Orient Verein ” and its proposed activities, supported by the German Government, for the development of relations between Germany and oriental countries. 3.

Many thanks for your letter of the 26th November about the sale of the Besht Consulate property. I am afraid that we are not in a position to name any figure for the sale of the Besht Vice-Consulate as our instructions are to obtain offers and then report to London. Would it therefore be asking too much of Mr. Coffey to try and extract a definite offer from one of the two potential buyers, which we could pass on to London ? I should be extremely grateful if he could do this. (9) Despatch from Sir P. Bamsay, to Sir Samuel Hoare, No. 319, dated the 12th December 1935. I have the honour to inform you that, according to the Danish press of the 11th and 12th December, negotiations between the Iranian Minister of Finance and Engineer Saxild, representing the Danish Kampsax consortium,. have resulted in the signing of a contract for the erection of twenty-one corn silos in Iran. One silo of a capacity of 65,000 tons together with a mill-building will be erected in Tehran and the remainder will be erected at other of the larger Persian towns. These latter silos will have capacities ranging from 8,000. to 16,000 tons. The total value of the work is estimated to be about 25 million kroner, and the work will take two and a half years to execute. The principle of the contract is the same as that upon which Kampsax’s railway contracts in Iran are based. The machinery equipment for the silos and the mill-building, the newspaper adds, is to be supplied by Soviet Bussia in accrodance with a contract concluded between the Iranian and the Soviet Governments. 2. I have transmitted a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and to the Department of Overseas Trade. ( 10 ) Telegram from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office,, London, No. 10, dated the 4th January 1936. I have following information regarding financial situation here which though some of the actual figures may be inaccurate is considered by the manager of Imperial Bank of Persia to give a true picture. 1. Sum of 100 millions of tomans is required within the next three years to complete railway programme. 2. Trade Department requires over 1 million pounds for their programme (factory building, etc.). 3. It is calculated by responsible Iranian Ministers that if the Shah could be persuaded to give up Anglo-Persian Oil Company royalties for three years, sum of six million pounds would be available but a further four million would be required (it is here that the figures appear slightly inaccurate). 4. These calculations do not include works at Banda Shahpur approved by the Shah (? grp. omtd.) wishes to continue. 5. Certain Ministers are seriously dissatisfied with the Minister of Finance (Davar) and intend to insist that the true position be brought to the knowledge of the Shah. It is intended to do this within the next few days when the Minister of Finance returns from the South. Minister of Transport is in favour of borrowing on Anglo-Lersian oil royalties now and hopes to persuade the Shah to abandon opposition to foreign loans and go into market. . 6 - Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia has allowed it to be known indirectly that in his view it would be imprudent to borrow full amount of ten million pounds, (which in his rough estimate of their requirements) at once and advises borrowing two million pounds with arrangement for periodical increases.( 11 ) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office London, No. 36, dated the 20th January 1936. The main topic of conversation at my audience with the Shah on 18th January has been dealt with in my telegram No. 36 of 18th January but it would seem appropriate if I gave you a more complete account of the interview. 2. His Majesty, after a few preliminaries, enquired whether I had any news about the position between Italy and Abyssinia. I said I had nothing but what appeared in the press. He expressed the view that the Italians seemed to have come to a standstill and said that in a war of that kind it was a serious thing when progress was held up. 3. His Majesty then turned to subjects of more direct interest and I took advantage of this to remark that our relations seemed greatly improved. Some what to my surprise His Majesty did not react to this observation as he has on previous occasions, He remarked that Iran certainly wanted to be friends with Great Britain and wanted Great Britain to be friends with her, but there were people in England who appeared to think otherwise. I said I thought this was not the case and that my Government were animated by the most friendly intentions. His Majesty explained that he was alluding to persons in no posi tion of responsibility. I answered that I had heard of no instance of anything objectionable appearing in the press at home for a long time. His Majesty laughed and said no doubt X was too busy to give attention to these things. I said that in Great Britain the press was entirely free. As His Majesty retorted that the press was free in all countries, I thought it better not to pursue the subject further. 4. His Majesty then enquired how long I should be staying in Baghdad on my way home and this led up to the subjetc of the Shatt-el-Arab, on which I have had the honour to report by telegram. 5 . His Majesty later enquired what accounts I should give in London of things in this country. I said I should speak of the great progress which had been made and was continuing. He spoke with evident pleasure of the spread of the movement fer the unveiling of women and I remarked that a country where the women were not free was a country cut in half. The conversation then turned to the subject of Kazemi’s visit to India, to which I made the first reference. This however only resulted in a long aside between the Shah and M. Kazemi and I understood the latter to be giving a description of the bad impression which he had retained of the condition of the masses. In the South (little of which His Excellency had in fact seen) he said it is very bad but in the North it is better. I asked His Excellency therefore to state to the Shah that in India there was a population of some two hundred and fifty million Hindus who clung very closely to their religious beliefs and that any interference was a delicate matter, 6 . M. Kazemi did not, I think, intend me to understand what he was saying. No doubt he was making it his business to suggest to His Majesty the immense snperioritv of Iran over India, but he may also have been actuated by pique brought on by the turn which our conversation over the Shatt-el-Arab had taken, 7. On departing I expressed to His Majesty the hope that on my i etui n from leave I should have the honour ot being received again. His Majesty indicated assent. 8 I have known His Majesty to be more cordial than on this occasion. His vague allusion to some offensive matter in the Press may account for this, thou°h I am unaware of any recent publication unless His Majesty has had time to study “Innocence and Design ”. He laughed heartily on one or two occasions but in general seemed somewhat glum. 9. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretaiy to the Government of India, No. 13 (17|52j36). ( 12 ) Foreign Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d Affaires, Tehran, to the Office, London, No. 51, dated the 27th January 19o6. I have the honour to enclose herein a copy of a minute by His Maiesty’s Minister recording a conversation with Monsieur Soheily on le ^ c &lt; - „ LSI91FDregard to a number of questions affecting East Iran, and also a copy of a memo - randum on these questions subsequently sent to him. o x am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 22), and to His Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorasan No. (13). Enclosure I to Serial No. (12). MEMORANDUM. East Iranian Questions* 1 called on M. Soheily on January 26th to discuss these questions. I said , . i i | o rc ,i talked to him on the general aspect of our diiucullies in East San some ttoe ill May last 1 had later, on October 26th, writtenhim a private letter fust before mv departure for India on the same subject, lie had led me to hope that he would speak to the Shah on the basis of my letter fmt I bekeved that conversation had never taken place. He had, hovmver, addressed the various departments concerned and informed them of my views and suggestions. On my return from India I had called on him and pointed out that the continued failure to settle anv of these questions hilled me with despair. He had on that occWi promised me that they should all be settled Wore my departure on leave M. Kazemi had given me a similar assurance. I was now- proposing t» &lt;&gt;o to End and in four davs time and still nothing had been done. I begged him to realise the deplorable effect which this would have. 2 I then went through the various outstanding cases, beginning with the case of the lorb drivers “requisitioned in Decemter 1934. I had had verbal assurances from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and himself that this was now to be settled, but nothing had been done. 3. M. Soheilv interrupted me to say that as regards the future instructions, had been sent that all requisitioning was to be on regular lines, through the Nazmieh and that the Government had thus done what they could to ensme against future abuses. I replied that I was aware ot this. M. Motamedy had similarlv informed the Oriental Secretary some days ago. I was grateful but suggested that it was most desirable that they should inform, me m writing.. I said I had often noticed a reluctance on the part of the Ministry for I oreign Affairs to inform us of things in writing, especially when those things related to any acquiescence in some request of ours. M. Soheily said it was not that, but they’frequently could not inform us in writing of matters as to which they had nothing in writing from other Departments. I said that, as regards the future reauisitioning of lorries, if they had nothing in writing from the Ministi\ of War. their assurances were not of much value. M. Soheily said that m this case they had something in writing. I pressed him to pass it on to us in wilting, it only to avoid future confusion. He said he would do his best. 4 . I next spoke of expulsions and arrests without proper statement of the oTOimds and cited the case of Seyed Abdul Hnsseni (see my despatch No. 12 of the 9th January). I said our note of the 9th of January was designed to secure avoidance of these cases in the future. M. Soheily said that Seyed Abdol, Husseni was a smuggler. I replied that that had nothing to do with it. The .point was that he had been arrested and expelled without proper charge or written information that his appeal had been rejected. I begged him to pay great attention to our note in order to ensure against future abuses of this kind. 5. Turning to the question of pilgrims I remarked that our notes of the 19th and 23rd of October still remained unanswered. M. Soheily replied that stringent instructions had been issued enjoining proper treatment of pilgrims in future. 1 asked him if he would let ns have this on paper. I said that in addition to safeguards for the future there was the question of compensation for the past. The 'saris of Mohammed Ali Habib had been as good as stolen : they and the fine paid by him should be restored. G. I said that I had prepared a memorandum putting all these cases together and proposed to send it to him. He acquiesced but asked that I should not put it too strongly about the lorry drivers as they had agreed to pay. I asked him how soon payment would be forthcoming. He said a report was being called for. To this I replied with despair that that should have been clone a year ago : if the whole thing was to be referred back to the local authorities, there would be endless delay and nothing would ever be done. This he denied, saying that they were going to act very quickly and he would do all he could toensure that they did so. To my question why they had not acted quickly before he replied that that was because previously they had not intended to pay v/hereas now they did intend to pay. It had not been a question of the money but of principle. Now the principle of payment had been accepted. I said that our claim for compensation had been very carefully drawn up and admitted by the local military authorities. I trusted that they would not try to whittle it down. If they offered us for example half, it would create ' a very bad impression. M. Soheily did not seem to think they would do that, and mentioned the sum for which we had asked, indicating that he thought it should be all right. 7. I told him that I should send him the memorandum as soon as possible. 8 . I then dealt with the recent arrests at Meshed after Mr. Mallet’s visit, I said that it was evident to me that to have any relations with the British was a crime in East Iran. The Headman of Talkh had been denounced for this reason and the Turcoman owner of the land where Major Humber had proposed to shoot had been arrested evidently for the same cause. M. Soheily had been very angry when the case was first brought to his notice. He said that he was still angry. He could not understand how anyone could suppose that for us to have any dealings with a village headman could possibly do any harm. I said that M. M otamedy had recently spoken to me about this case and read me a report received from the Meshed authorities which stated that proceedings had been instituted against these men before and quite irrespective of Mr. Mallet’s visit. I said that I thought this difficult to believe. In the case of Ismail of Talkh it was quite clear that what had gone against him was the insinuation that he had been in touch with the British. I begged M. Soheily to look carefully into these cases. He said he would do so. Evidently as far as he was concerned, he saw the justice of my remarks. 9. The conversation then turned to the difficulties experienced by His Majesty’s Consulate-General for Khorassan in dealing with local officials, and the tendency of the latter to put the blame of everything that went wrong on to us. M. Soheily remarked here with surprising frankness that after the Pahlevi Hat affair and the riots in the shrine the Meshed authorities were very nervous. I said “ ves ” and that thev therefore tried to make us the scapegoats. To this he ao-reed. He went on to suggest that His Majesty’s Consul-General was out of svmpathy with local life and so forth. I answered that on the contrary it wa s the local authorities who refused to have relations with him and _ wno rendered the execution of his task difficult. Monsieur SoheiG, T said, uiew Colonel Daly and could judge for himself. We had an English proverb Give a dog a bad name and hang him ’’—this is what they had done to Colonel Daly. They had rendered life at the Consulate-General impossible, it was like iving in r leper hospital. They could hardly go outside and they could certainly not go out shooting without endangering the liberty of the local people. 10 . I went on to say, with regard to the number of cases which we had to brine 1 up that it was entirely unreasonable of the Ministry to accuse us ^ o iutentionallv making difficulties because we had to bring up again and again intentionally mamn an The fact that a case was an old one and hndirke kept alive was a proof not of our desire to make difficulties, but of liaa to oc Kepi cl y v , ^ ’ t. xu/vm Thpc;p oases were ones of manliest their lack of to protect the interests injustice done . to , Bn ™ J^i e fp. a rs 0 ns case. This was a clear case of gross of British subjects. I ci fn , l . t ^ upset because it was revived, but injustice. It was all very well for ^ mio . ht say that it was a this was due to their earliei treatme ' , 110 thi n o&gt; about, but would that tiresome matter and one which they reasonfor dropping the matter ? satisfy Parsons, and could I , hl ™ V • ' ortailc3 0 f securing better things for I quite agreed as to the desirability a P I mia authorities were responsible the future, but these old abuses remained the Iranmu a f , otten without an for them and they could not expect us to let tnem oecoi fe attempt to secure redress. . 11 . I then said that when I had Xfo^JmaZuesS which cCded issues were dormant but there were a n ™ p f . the Ministry for Foreign the atmosphere. I had enlisted the assis a , | been successful Affairs in clearing these questions away. On But in and the atmosphere m the West ot Iran at a Minister for Foreign Affairs the East these difficulties had since ^^rf^niaior outstanding had a few days ago expressed a wish to discuss certainissues and had asked me to call ^“ n TiMce^t meUe exactly what lie intended to t h e atmosphere remained clouded cwssaw -«*'- - *• »■*&gt;■ To this Monsieur Soheily readily agreed. I then Went on to speak of the attitude of the Government of India. I said that there were several things which must inevitably creete a most a^wema ^ impression at Delhi. The first was the Iranian reaction to then proposals for alleviating their difficulties with their Baluchi tribes. I said “ at 1 * elt ri stromdv about this from a personal point of view. \ ery soon alter my a a fhe Prime Minister had taken the matter up with me. I had done everything in my power to clear up the difficulty and the Government oi India had made certain suggestions for helping. Instead of accepting and expressing gratitude for this the Iranian Government, after first criticising and picking holes m the proposals had finally returned no reply at all, not even an expression of thanks, simply because we had been quite unable to. grant one of then desiderata. Did he think the Government of India would appreciate being treated thus l Tiien there had been the Gorich Kalag affair in which we had first been accused m unmeasured terms of violating the Iranian frontier ; when we had proved th„t this was not the case, our statements had been called m question, the 1 alll ‘ l '‘ Government had intimated a desire to check them on the spot, we had then been told that we had agreed to a Frontier Commission and finally when in response to their request for facilities we had arranged for their representative, it required, to be met at the frontier by our Officer from the Indian side, they bad returned no reply whatever. Moreover, in spite of their verbal undertaking not to allow their representatives to proceed up to the frontier till arrangements had been made for them to be met by onr Officer, they had sent them to the frontier. My own opinion was that the Iranian Government were conscious of being in the wrong and of having acted imprudently and, sooner than admit the fact, had decided to try and let the matter drop. Monsieur Soheily said that he thought that there was a misunderstanding. I said I did not see now this could be. The Government of India had been treated with great discourtesy and could not he expected to overlook it. Nevertheless I did not want this incident, in which there was an element of comedy, to acquire disproportionate importance. 13. 1 then went on to the subject of Ships visits. _ I said that a few days:, ago Motamedy had asked me not to link up the ships visits with the request foi repair facilities at Bombay. 1 had replied that I had no wish to make a direct bargain and was quite prepared to treat the two matters separately. I had indeed telegraphed for instructions to London and New Delhi. But in view of what I had said about the Baluchis and Gorich Kalag, coupled with the mmvaise- volenti of the Ministrv of War, I did not think that it was reasonable to expect the Government of India to show great good will. They had been .very happy to accord these repair facilities in the past and would be very happy to do so again, but it was absurd to expect them to do so unless they were met \yith an equally accommodating' spirit. I was convinced that the refusal of the Ministry of War hitherto to agree to onr proposals for vessels of the Gulf Division fuelling at Abadan was due to mauvaise volente and to nothing else. It was absurd to. argue that they would lay themselves open to a corresponding demand from Russia. The position was utterly different. At Abadan there was a huge British company developing Iranian resources, bringing huge sums of money into Iran and doing ap educational and development work among Iranian youths which was of immense value and which I had seen myself. The ships in the Gulf were in a special category : the privilege we were asking for was only in urgent cases of fuelling. Their answer to Russia was obvious. Moreover, a year ago the Shah had assured me of his desire for close relations between the two navies. I pressed him as strongly as I could to induce the Ministry of War to agree. I asked if the Shah knew the facts of the case : he replied that His Majesty only knew the bare outline. I said, as regards the Russian argument,, that we might as well argue that if we gave the Iranian ships repair facilities at Bombay we should he incurring an obligation to give them to Siam and China equally. Monsieur Soheily said that the difficulty was, that the Ministry of War didn’t see the question in the true light. 14. Finally, returning to the general subject, I urged him as earnestly as I could to get these questions settled. Monsieur Soheily, who took a certain number of notes, promised to do his best..15. Whether he is successful or not in getting the old cases settled, I do think that he will secure some improvement in the future. H. M. K.-H. Jan. 26th. Enclosure II to Serial No. ( 12 ). Despatch prom His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Son Excellence Monsieur A. Soheily, Ministere des Afpaires Etrangeres, No. 217/1/36, DATED THE 27TH JANUARY 1936. Je vous envoie ci-joint le memorandum concernant les diflerentes questions dout nous avone parle hier. Vous savez combien je suis reconnaissant envers vous et tout la Ministere de tout ce que vous faites pour aider a soiutioner ces questions. J’espere que bientot je n’aurai plus a vous importuner. Enclosure III to Serial No. (12). MEMORANDUM. His Majesty’s Minister has on many occasions during the past year had the honour to address the Iranian Ministry for Foreign Affairs both verbally and in writing on the subject of the treatment of British subjects in East Iran. These cases include the forcible employment of British Indian lorry drivers in zones of danger, the arrest and expulsion of British Indians without the legal formalities usual on such occasions, and the vexatious and unjust treatment of pilgrims. His Majesty’s Minister observes with regret that up to the present, in spite of repeated representations, these matters remain unsettled. 2. First, as regards the case of British Indian lorry drivers, which actually occurred in December of the 3 mar before last (1934), it is remarked with satisfaction that His Majesty’s Minister has now received verbal assurances from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that compensation is about to be paid. In view of the long delay and the serious circumstances of the case, which were described to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in full detail in a memorandum, dated July 7th, 1935 (15th Tyr, 1314), His Majesty’s Minister reiterates his earnest hope that a speedy and satisfactory settlement will now be made of these cases. 3. A further case of requisitioning of British Indian lorry drivers occurred recently and was brought to the notice of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in an aide-memoire left with the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on December 1.9th (27th Azar) last, which was followed by another aide-memoire giving fuller details on January 2nd (11th Dey). These were again cases of simple commandeering by the military authorities, contrary to arrangements agreed on in 1930 between the Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs and His Majesty’s Legation. The drivers were detained in barracks and His Majesty’s Vice Consul at Zahedan was not allowed to see them. Eight cases occurred m which Indian drivers and shopkeepers were beaten by the military authorities. In his aide-memoire of January 2nd (11th Dey) His Majesty/s Minister pressed for due compensation for the victims of these cases of requisition and beating, and for reasonable payments to the comimandeered drivers and asked that steps be taken to ensure against a repetition of such irregularities. He also as ec that Indians only holding visas entitling them to operate only on the Zahedan- Nok Kundi road should be entirely exempt from commandeering anc uia . on y such Indians should be liable as had visas ordinarily enabling them to ply tor hire in the interior of Iran. He trusts that reasonable compensa ion wi be delayed and also that he may receive in a categorical statement t assurances which have been conveyed to him verbally tha ins mm s c been issued that a regular procedure, as desired, is to be followed m future. 4. Secondly, cases of expulsion of British subjects ^^ris formalities last formed the subject of representations m His Majesty s Mmistei s note No. 11 of January 9th (18th Dey, 1314) A typical ^Mance^of the unfair hardship occasioned by the action of the local authorities is he of Seyed Abdul Hussein. ™s man ^ s country, the first on August 14th 1933 (Moruad ^na, m ; v (Aban subsequently to have been revoked) and the second on ^ 'orders * against 8 th, 1314). No reason was given for the issue of thfe orders^ag ^ the second of which the man appealed to the Minister of informed November 27th, 1935 (Azar 5th, 1314) he was agf *ed by the pol ce and mtormea verballv that his appeal had been dismissed. The police prop ^ t P at once, but owing to the intervention of His Majesty’s Consul-Heneiai, LS192FD18 obtained ten days in which to leave the^.eountry The injustice^of these nroceedings is manifest and m his note His Majesty s Minister pressed tor regularisation of the proceedings whereby written statements should be given bwl e oral noliee showing the grounds for the issue of expulsion orders while written statement 6 should'^lso be given by the Minister of the Interior showing fhe grounds on which any appeal has been dismissed (and not verbal statements by the local police) and in the event of ultimate expulsion a period of at least one month’s grace allowed from the date of the announcement to the individual concerned of the rejection of the appeal to enable him to make all necessary arrangements. 5. Thirdly, the cases of unjust and vexatious treatment of British Indian pilgrims are 'particularly serious. The general question was dealt wit i in a memorandum handed to the Under-Secretary of State as long ago as October 19th (26th Mehr, 1314). A typical instance is afforded by the case ot a pilgrim passing through this country from Iraq. The case was given m detail m the memorandum of October 19th (26th Mehr). This man passed the Customs at Khosrovi. He *was nevertheless detained by the Customs at Damghan until midnight on the day of his arrival there, while the ladies of his party were made to wait in a garagu. Eleven pieces of silk bought in Iraq for his family were confiscated. The police further insisted on his paying Rs. 300 (three hundred Rupees) as security, for which sum he was given a receipt. He was told to call at the Revenue Office at Meshed. At Meshed it was arranged that he should proceed to India, leaving an agent to represent him at the hearing of the case. He was further informed that the confiscated goods would be sent to him on the production of a certificate of his respectability and that the secmity money would also be returned. The pilgrim procured and furnished the _ desired certificate, signed by the District Commissioner at Lucknow. Meanwhile, how ever, his representatiev at Meshed was informed that the case had been decided at Tehran (in spite of the arrangement of which he was eventually informed for the hearing at Meshed) and the silk confiscated and that a fine of Rials 1,215 (one thousand two hundred and fifteen rials) had been imposed : only on payment of the fine would the security money be restored. 6 . A further and still more serious cases was brought to the notice of the Ministry in His Majesty’s Minister’s note No. 624 of October 23rd, 1935 (30th Mehr, 1314). In this case, in spite of the fact that the pilgrim, Mahomedali Habib of Bombay, had equally passed the customs at Khorsrovi and held a receipt for duty paid there on certain small articles, nevertheless, at Damghan all the saris and many other garments belonging to the ladies of his party were unjustly confiscated and a fine of Rials 3,142 (three thousand one hundred and forty two rials) levied without justification. The full facts are given in His Majesty’s Minister’s note of October 23rd (30th Mehr) in which it was asked that a careful investigation should he made, the confiscated articles and the sum paid in fine returned to their owners and strict instructions issued to prevent the repitition of such incidents. 7. Three months have now elapsed since the date of these notes on the subject of the pilgrims and no answer has been returned. Moreover, in spite of verbal assurances given more than once to His Majesty’s Minister that these various questions of the treatment of British subjects in East Iran, which have formed the subject of so many representations, would be settled, no satisfaction has yet been given and in all these cases the representations of His Majesty’s Minister remain unanswered. In addition to this, the general question of the difficulties caused to British subjects and to His Majesty’s Consular Officers in East Iran formed the subject of a private letter addressed by His Majesty’s Minister to the Gerant of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on October 26th (3rd Aban) last. These representations also appear as yet to have produced no result, and no further communication has been made to His Majesty’s Minister. 8 . His Majesty’s Minister must again urge with the utmost emphasis that early and serious attention be paid to these matters in order that the past hardships may be rectified and all necessary measures be taken to ensure against their repetition in the future. Finally, he would beg the Iranian Government to realize the serious impression created in the minds of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India, both of whom are fully cognizant of these matters, by the continued failure of the * Iranian Government to remove these very legitimate grievances.

Our opinion therefore, if we may venture it, is that either Bagdad has discovered a mare’s nest, or that the bogy of Pan-Iranian propaganda has been put up to cover a little propaganda among the Kurds in favour of Iraq. Finally, a little side-light ; our informant stated that the Iranis are busy improving and widening the road from Baneh to Saidesht ; he understood it was being done for military purposes.

The Ministers’ East Iranian omnibus memorandum to Sokeily, a copy of which was enclosed in my despatch No. 51 of the 2/th January, has evoked, not from Soheily to whom the Minister sent it with a very friendly cover but from Kazemi a characteristic protest. Copies of it and of a soothing syrup of Loxley’s production that I have sent in answer to it are enclosed herein. 2. Further detailed comment is almost superfluous, but ( 1 ) we have had these outbursts before, and have not always replied to them, ( 2 ) our complaints have not been based on a few isolated instances but on a volume of evidence as to the high handed treatment of British Indian subjects in East Iran, and the Government of India are seriously concerned over this. 3. There is no real analogy between the delays on our side (Motamedy tried to rub these in to Trott when communicating the letter, quoting Lights and Buoys), which are normally due to the multitude of authorities who have to be consulted and the history and the complexity of the subjects or to the Iranians’ own refusal to settle things on the spot through our Consuls ; and the delavs on their side which have little justification and are much greater. • 4 . It is to put it mildly, odd for a Minister for Foreign Affairs to send an official Note to a Charge d’Affaires animadverting on the contents of a com munication sent privately to a member of his Department by a Minister. 5. Although part of the ground taken in the Ministers memorandum has been cut under us by subsequent Iranian action, it would have been easy to take Kazemi’s Note up point by point, in writing or orally, for no number of virtuous protests will bring the dead Indian drivers back to life or give the living ones back their maimed hands ; and I could have used this occasion to speak from the Gurich Kalag text which you and the Government of India have authorised me to do, or to refer to the attitude of the local authorities at Kerman on the occasion of the King’s death as described by Bazalgette, a copy of whose despatch goes to you by this bag. On the whole, however, the main point is that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs do their best to help us, and we get no help from any other official quarter here. It is, therefore, to our interest to bury this particular business in a way which will not damp the Ministry’s readiness to help us in certain matters that we shall shortly put before them, and perhaps in bigger ones that we cannot clearly foresee, but of which fhn Office gave U|S a hint well before the Minister left. I believe that a controversial rejoinder, largely in vacuo, would not help in the above, and would be a waste of ammunition. Hence the soothing and even sickly syrup : mv replv does however stress the deep-seated discontent of the Government of India with the present state of affairs. I hope you and the Minister will approve. 6 . I am sending a copy of the correspondence to Sir Aubrey Metcalfe. vEnclosure to Serial No. (18). Teanslation OF A Note from the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs ( rmRo Political ^lotion) to His Majesty's Charge d’affaires. No. 500641 g871, dated 27tii Lsfand 1314 ; 17th February 1936. Monsieur le Charge d’Affaires, His Excellency Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, before leaving Tehran addressed a private letter to His Excellency Monsieur Soheily numbered 2171 11 36, dated the 27th January 1936, in which he enclosed a memorandum which mentioned certain cases concerned with British Indian subjects residing’ in Iran. 0 At the time of the arrival of the above-mentioned letter I wrote certain letters addressed to His Excellency Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, dealing with the matters set forth in the said memorandum, and since then I have addressed correspondence in the matter to you, and I have given explanations relating to each of these questions ; and I do not wish to embark upon a dis cussion of the details and aspects of the various questions referred to therein. Nevertheless, I deem it necessary at this juncture to bring the following points to your notice :— First, speaking generally, the language used in the memorandum attached to the above-mentioned note is irreconcilable with the spirit of friendship and sincerity which controls the relations between two countries, and I am sorry to say that in the method of composition of its sentences and its expressions necessary attention to courtesy was not observed. For example, in certain places of the memorandum expressions such as the following were employed ; “ unjust pressure ”, “ lack of justice ”, “ conduct which was inequitable and tiresome ”, “ without observing proper rules ”, and “ levying a fine without justification ”, etc. ; I am quite unable to accept the attribution of these expressions to Iranian officials. Second, in the third and fourth paragraphs of the above-mention'ed memorandum requests were made concerning requisitions of lorries and also concerning the revision of orders of expulsion, which amount to interference and to the expression of views concerning the laws and regulations in force in the country ; and such expressions are not acceptable to my Government. Third, in the eighth part of the memorandum of His Excellency Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, in the course of expressions which most of all seem to hint at threats, he wishes to attribute continual transgressions, to Iranian officials, and to maintain the view that this fact causes the creation of a bad impression on the British Government and the Indian Government. I protest against these insulting expressions and against, this method of reasoning, and I regret that this matter has been given greater importance than is necessary so that such correspondence has resulted : and I cannot refrain from mentioning this, that (I cannot see) how the requisitioning ot one or several cars the hire of which either has been paid m the usual wav or will be paid and the retention of a few saris which rook Dlace as the result of the owner’s failure to comply with the laws and regula tions in force in this country and finally tjhe expulsion of certain notorious nersous who had been guiltc of smuggling or other improper acts, can affect the delations between two^ nafions, especially «-e relahons renose fortunately, upon a solid foundation ; and if the delays m. setting milter’s which result from the fact that those matters have to be examined and enouired into in the proper offices and ministries, be construed as faults, the impGovernmenJcan also, rightly and equitably, take the same view m regard to many matters. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to (Signed) BAGHER KAZEMI. _ r , n’AuFAIRES TeHRAN, TO THE IrAXIWST MiXISTER Note from His Majesty s AT ’ ED THE 20th February 1936. -pnu Foreign Affairs, -No. Zl/lojoo, dai^u in . . AT J a wifh distress Your Excellency’s official Note No. I have read with care and Ay E a fand 1314), on the subject of a 50064[3871 of the 17th J^tleatroent of British Indian subjects in East memorandum m regard t '’ 1 ‘ j tt r to His Excellency Monsieur Soheily ^^^“r^Yuuary (Bahman 6 th, 4344).2. As Your Excellency says, the memorandum in question was an enclosure to a private letter written to His Excellency Monsieur Solieily b} my Mmistei and dealt solely with a number of matters which they had discussed together on the previous day. It was a personal far more than an official communica tion and for this reason Your Excellency will, I feel sure, not expect me to comment on it or to reply in any detail to Your Excellency’s own note. 3. I should, however, like to say that I feel sure that Your Excellency recognises the earnest desire of my Minister to do all that is in his pow r er to see good relations between the Imperial Government and His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom and the Government of India. It has always been his sincere wish to collaborate in a frank and friendly manner with Your Excellency and your Department in all matters touching our mutual interests and nothing would have been further from his desire than to take any step which the Imperial Government might regard as being 1 inspired by unfriendly feelings towards them. There cannot, therefore, I feel lie any need to assure lour Excellency that the sole purpose of his memorandum was to endeavour to secure the settlement of a number of questions affecting British subjects which have caused serious concern to the Government of India and thus to improve yet further the relations between our Governments. 4 . Your Excellency will, I know, be the first to recognise that it is among the foremost duties of a Government to protect its nationals in foreign countries and you will equally be aware that the concern felt by the Government of India at the treatment of British Indian subjects in East Iran has not merely formed the subject of communications from this Legation, but was expressed at some length to Monsieur Motamedy by Mr. Caroe at the time of Your Excellency’s visit to Delhi. I need not, therefore, say any more on this subject, though I would add that I feel confident that after your visit to Delhi Your Excellency can be in no doubt of the earnest desire of the Government of India to see good relations established between India and Iran. Anything that may be written from this Legation is, therefore, solely designed to further friemlly collaboration between our Governments. 5. Your Excellency doubtless realises that the notes and letters written by you and which you mention in the second paragraph of your note, did not reach His Majesty’s Legation until after my Minister’s departure on leave. Had he been here to read them, he would undoubtedly have washed to express personally to Your Excellency his warm thanks for the friendly steps vdiich you have taken to settle the various difficulties vdiich have in the past been experienced by Indian pilgrims. I have already expressed to Your Excellency my owm very sincere thanks in the matter and I should like to take the present opportunity to say once more how much I appreciate the evidence of goodwill thus shown by the Imperial Government. 6 . In general I feel confident that it will be Your Excellency’s earnest desire to maintain the friendly collaboration which so happily exists between His Majesty’s Legation and Your Excellency’s Department to whose unfailing assistance I observe that His Majesty’s Minister paid a w T arm tribute in the letter to Monsieur Soheily.

Km J;, T . he “fT* ™ uld appear to be both arbitrary and unreasonable, several important factors not having been taken into consideration, e a climatic conditions, state of roads, gradients and the possibility of obtaining loads tor the return trip. Besides these obvious points there are no doubt several technical objections m respect of type of lorrv, petrol consumption wear and tear of expensive tyres, load capacity, etcetera. 3. The regulations, if applied rigorously, will no doubt be circumvented— as so many are. The way-bill may be in perfect order, but freight actually paid will have to satisfy the chauffeur if the transport is to be done. 4. It has been reported that the initial enforcement in Mazanderan resulted m a sudden shortage of vehicles in the particular district. ^ 5. There has been talk of Government monopoly of transport for which lorries would be purchased. The scheme could hardly be a success as practi cally the only people who can make money out of transport are chauffeurs driving their own lorries— or the owner who can accompany his lorry (or convoy) in order to check movements, encashment of fares and expenditure. With the ever increasing m'onopolistic tendency, however, any venture is possi ble—even the obviously impossible. 6 .

According to the Bulletin of the Banque Mellie Iran, dated October last, the Societe d’Exportation de Sel with a capital of 500,000 rials (£5,550),_ of which half subscribed by the Agricultural Bank, was “ Fondee pour V exploita tion des gisements de sel de Hamahdan, ile de Chechme, el 1,extraction et exportation des derives du sel.” I understand that the other half interest in the company was in the hands of an Iranian group, the managing director of which is Mohamed Ali Daneshwar, of the Irano-Japanese Trading Company. It appears that this group had the right to let or sell its share to a third party, and it was the Japanese who acquired the interest. The terms are not known, but a price of about 8 s. a ton has been mentioned in this connexion.35 3 ' f ^ ^p ne ® G Tn Ve lmp 0 rt u d e ?P losives . and equipment for the exploita- H 6 ’ it J ?S ai S Se sa 1 lt ' minm ^ engineer arrived at Bandar Abbas from Bombay on the 5th December last, his arrival coinciding with that of panv oTTllman.'' &amp; PaneSG ° f the Iran °- Ja P a ^ Trading Com- 4.

(27) Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 137-E., dated the 19th March 1936. I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a translation of the Iranian Budget for the year 1315, ending 20 th March 1937, as published in “ Le Journal de Teheran ” of 11 th and 12th March. The budget was passed unanimously by the Mejlis on 10th March. 2. Revenue is estimated at Rials 1,000,016,740 (about twelve million, five hundred thousand, two hundred and ten pounds at the official rate of Rials 80 to the pound) and expenditure at Rials 1,000,008,484 (about twelve million, five hundred thousand, one hundred and six pounds). These figures show an increase of nearly two hundred and fifty million Rials (about three million, one hundred and twenty thousand pounds) or a little over thirty three per centum over the estimates for the previous year. 3. Increases on the revenue side include Rials 30,000,000 (£375,000) from income tax and stamp duty ; Rials 58,000,000 (£725,000) from indirect taxation ; Rials 130,000,000 (£1,625,000) from customs duties (in which are included receipts from the Gfovernment’s trade in sugar, now much diminished owing to che reduction effected in the selling price of the commodity) ; and Rials 70,000,000 (£875,000) from monopolies. 4 . On the expenditure side, the usual increase of twenty million Rials (two hundred and fifty thousand pounds) occurs in the estimates for the Ministry of War including provision for road guards, the vote for this Ministry amounts to Rials 269,408,380 (£3,367,605) or just less than twenty-seven per centum of the total estimated expenditure, exclusive of a credit of £ 2 , 000,000 voted m the surmlementarv budget law. The largest additional credit is one o Rials 150 000 000 (£1,875,000) for railway construction. The supplementary Budget^law makes further provision for the Ministry -T Con- cations of a million pounds from reserve funds and Rials lo0,000,000 out of the sugar and tea monopoly tax fund. 5 Other credits necessitated by the progressive programme, industrial, aonicultural and general, include nearly five million Rials (sixty-two thousand, i Ivor! nrmrTrlsl for nublic hygiene ; nearly ten million Rials (one hundred five hundred pounds) for puDi c ny Mipi ; trv of Education, Rials 5,000,000 andtw^-fivel^.idpoundsMoi^ 5 000 00D f ’ r the Depart- to complete and t ■Tq^qqo 000 for the Department of Agriculture; ™ e 7 ” f Jnnno bee 250) for the purchase of a Royal Yacht ; Rials 20 . 000,000 h’olLom for eionobic or^auisatfons of public utility, to be ratified by special laws! and Kals 15,000,000 (£187,500) for the creation of the Tobacco Monopoly s curette ^etory. bonou^ to^transmit^he^ith, » MamT InLdition to thf cVe^ts'already mentioned for the Ministry of Roads' * ;, 'U 36 and Communications and for the Ministry of War, the payment of a sum of £80,000 from the Government Reserve was sanctioned for payments due on account of the sugar factories. These credits, as well as similar ones sanc tioned in the Supplementary Law to the Budget for the year 1314 (March 1933, to March 1936) are not restricted to only one financial year. 7. Article III authorises the Department of Industry to borrow from the Banque Mellie Iran, within limits to be sanctioned by the Council of Ministers, for requirements for the sugar factories. 8 . Article IV states that the revolving credit has been fixed at Rials- 90,000,000 (£1,125,000) in conformity with the law of 30th Mordad, 1309 (22nd August 1930) which authorised the Ministry of Finance to create a revolving- fund for the requirements of the Treasury General and, in order to do so, to borrow Rials 30,000,000 from the National Bank of Iran. 9. Article VI lays down that from 21st March 1936, all tobacco products will be included within the meaning of Article XV of the Supplementary Law to the budget for 1314, in which only cigarette tobacco was mentioned in con nexion with the Tobacco Monopoly. 10. The subsequent ten Articles deal mainly with administrative measures and are of little interest except Article IX which authorises the Government to act towards the foreign diplomatic corps in accordance with international custom in respect of requirements of sugar, petrol and paraffin oil. 11. A comparative table showing revenue and expenditure estimates for the present and the last budget is attached. 12 . As usual, the budget does not show royalties paid by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, the revenue'from the sugar and tea monopoly tax and the bulk of the proceeds of the road tax. No figures are published of the actual revenue and expenditure of previous years, nor are any recent figures available of expenditure incurred on railway construction. 13.

With reference to Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen’s despatch No. 4231-E. of the 2nd October 1935, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, copies of the thirtyfifth, thirtysixth and thirtyseventh reports of the Board of Control of reserves against bank notes and nickel coinage, published in the Official Gazette of the Ministry of Justice on the 23rd January 1936. 2 . The value of bank notes issued to the Banque Mellie Iran at the 23rd October 1935 is stated to be Rials 564,933,450 (£7,061,6^0 at the present official rate of Rials 80 to the pound), against which reserves of gold and silver bars* valued at Rials 475,288,083 (£5,941,100), or nearly eighty five per centum. 3. The notes issued show an increase over the figures for the 22nd Octo ber 1934 of Rials 241,845,020 (£3,023,060). 4. The amount of notes actually in circulation is not shown in the latest reports, nor are details of what the reserve comprises, though it is obvious that the gold forming the bulk of the nominal capital of the Banque Mellie is included. 5.

J now tiavp tha hononr to anolnsa a aopy of Captain Eazaig-ette’s despatch in repl} r which I venture to think is of some interest and plausibility. It indicates as regards official and non-official Persians a negative absence of animosity, and an active prevalence of fear. 2. The position indeed as he sees it gives only modified encouragement except for the opinions that he quotes to the effect that relations are more friendly than they were three years ago. The Oriental Secretary to this Legation is inclined to endorse this view, feeling that there exists at any rate a more stable atmosphere than in 1932 when the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s Concession had been cancelled, and Teymourtache was patently a falling star. 3. In parenthesis, as regards the highly important matter of the Company’s Concession, Air. Fraser, the Deputy Chairman, has been here for a few days negotiating with the Minister of Finance. He had a cordial interview with the Shah, and told me that he has had nothing to complain of regarding the Iranian attitude towards the Concession since the revision. He expects indeed to leave Tehran in a good atmosphere and with a clean slate, though for the Company it may ultimately mean a lighter pocket. 4. It would be out-of-place to attempt from Captain Bazalgette’s despatch an analysis of the general position as certain Consular reports which have been invited are not yet forthcoming. But even a rough estimate at the beginning of the Iranian Xew Year may be of some interest and Mr. Trott has endeavoured to consider the alleged improvement since 1932 in relation to the other provinces. Broadly speaking he is conscious of little if any change for the better in Khorassan, where last year’s Meshed massacre has left a cowed population, in Mekran, in Kermanshah or on the Gulf, though Capt. Chauncy at Mohammerah moves freely and in Khuzistan Air. AYatkinson has established relations with the all—powerful Officer Commanding Troops and even with the Iranian Club at Ahwaz. Only in Shiraz and possibly Tabriz, besides Kerman, is improve ment discernible to us here. This very broad estimate may well require revision when Consular reports are forthcoming. Meanwhile Air. Trott shares Captain Bazalgette’s view that the number of Iranians visiting any British Consulate is most closely related to the policy pursued by the local chief of police. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, No. 79. Enclosure to Serial No. (30). Letter from His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, to His AIajesty’s AIinister,. Tehran, No. 27, dated the 11th March 1936. I have the honour to refer to your Savingram No. 1 of the 29th February last, regarding the relations of non-official Iranians with this Consulate. 2. Non-official Iranians have called on me on two occasions only—on 1 st January 1936 and at the Condolence Reception on the 25th January, neither occasion being a Social Call. 3. I have only been in Kerman four months, so it is difficult for me to express an opinion on local conditions. I have discussed the question privately with Doctor Dodson (30 years in the C. M. S. Hospital, Kerman) and Air. Iliff (10 years in the C. M. S. School), and my views are necessarily based on what they have told me. 4. From the very nature of his work. Doctor Dodson has never suffered from any active anti-British feeling. On the other hand he says the Iranians are not as intimate as they were ten to fifteen year's ago, but are more friendly than they were three years ago. Air. Iliff says that three years ago no Iranian would da re to go to his house or even to speak to'him in the road. Iranians now call on him freely and often, and are not “ ashamed ” to be seen with him in public. 5. Both say, and I am inclined to agree with them from what I have heard from oilier sources, that there never was any hatred against Great Britain, but that the fear of persecution by officials prevented intimacy in the first place, and fear lead to a certain amount of ill-feeling against British Subjects. 6 . I thank that the call on the Consulate on the 1 st January was made because of a decrease of fear, not an increase of courage. The Cir-Governor- General and e^-Rais-i-Shahrbani had both been friendly, if not intimate, with the Consulate. The latter came to tea, privately, at the end of last year. As aresult, I think that a few local non-officials thought that they would not eet i^to trouble if they called on New Year’s Day. They were not ceLured for callffi “ ana so when a reception was given to receive the Iranian officials’ condolences sitGi tiio cl&lt;;iUii oi iiis Late ]\Iajesty ? a very much greater number called . 7 - ln J lie meantime, however, the Bais-i-Shahrbani was transferred to diKi 9 iig\\ Iv 9 is 91 lived, about two duys before the reception. It whs he who placed spies on the Consulate and sent for and censured all Iranian callers. 8 . His Excellency Aqai Hassan Peernia, the ex : Governor-General had a number of personal enemies in Kerman. One complaint I have heard is that he was “ unbriliable ” and the first honest Governor-General for many vears • His Brothers-in-law were involved in the Roads Department contract scandals Further, his wife is the daughter of a Mullah of Nain, who is known to be against the emancipation of women. The local Rais-i-Muarif is said to have reported him for slackness in enforcing the unveiling of women, and to have reported his wife for speaking against unveiling. It is said that His Excellency is in Tehran now, on the list of Dispensible officials. The charges against him are unknown here, but it is quite possible that the efiarge of being pro-British has been included, although this is only rumour. 9. After he was summoned to Tehran, he was very careful to do nothing to make his case worse. For this reason he spent his time giving or attending “ unveiled ” parties. It is possible that for fear of a “ pro-British ” charge, he tried to prevent Iranians calling on January 25th. It is clear that he went in fear of his subordinates, among whom he had no friend. 10. There are no signs of a renewal of social relations with the Consulate. (31) P. Z.-194011936. Enclosure in Foreign Office covering note No. T.-5161|51611377, dated 17th March, 1936. CHAPTER VII.

I have the honour to report on certain events that occurred on and around tin - 1 “■ K “- «w» 2. When the Diplomatic body collected in the Garden of the Gulistan Palace on hew lear s Day, March 21, it was quickly noised that M. Kazerni had been dismissed. Some connected his fall with the recent Contract scandals then occupying pride of place in the newspapers, in view of his having been Minister lor Roads and Communications for a few months in 1931-32. Others attributed it to the apparent immobility of the diplomatic position at Baghdad, and there were other stories. 3. These were interrupted by a scene between our Dean, the Afghan Ambassador, and a member of the Persian Protocol, the former maintaining with his usual fire that it was an insult to the Diplomatic body to keep them standing in the garden. So we were marched up into the Waiting Chamber, and then down again and up into the Salle des Brillants in which the Salaam is held. There the Afghan Ambassador, in a speech for which he was subsequently much criticised, told us in front of 2 Persian Court Officials to stand at attention and not whisper or titter after His Imperial Majesty had come in. 4. The Shah had already that morning received Ministers, Deputies, former Ministers, Judges, Professors at the University, and heads of important Insti tutions. All these functionaries were for the first time wearing the newly- approved uniforms and the Doctors of the University in particular in hoods and banns and hexagonal mortar-boards made a brave show in form and colour. 5. When the Shah walked in to greet the Diplomatic Corps, significantly it was by M. Soheily that he was attended. His Imperial Majesty has much to trouble him. the scandals, the dismissal of his Foreign Minister, and all the decisions on State matters, and he was looking listless and glum. He spoke to few and only to the Turkish Ambassador with any animation. Apart from the usual congratulations I ventured to express to him His Majesty’s grateful recognition of the personal sympathy that His Imperial Majesty had recently displayed on the occasion of his father’s death. Pater in the day, the head of the Protocol seems to have been sent with a reproving message to the frail, invalid but charming Japanese Minister who had not managed his message, hand shaking and introductions to the Shah’s satisfaction. 6. The Diplomatic Corps dispersed, the heads of the Missions to sign their names later in the dav with their wives, in the Queen’s book at the Shah s new Palace and most of them, but not myself, to collect again in the evening at the Iraqi Minister’s National Day reception when M. Kazemi s dismissal, and the Doyen’s gaffe, served as bases for discussion. 7 iphypp different reasons are given to account for the foimei; two have alreJdv been ment o ed Either of these would be adequate. The date rather ahead} been mentioned. \ Kazemi’s departure a month later would favours the scandals theory tor M. mizemi s q^pci rilTrimnrq f 0 the have been in accordance with several f^iecas ’-a iferefen Affairs insist that enntrnrv m K ctill a free man. The Ministry for I oreign Anairs insist mat contiai} be is stdl airee i all d that in 2 or 3 months’time M. Kazemi the scandals Have nothing to do with it, and b d T1 W ell-informed may be emploved m some capacity at home or aoroau. 1Counsellor at the Iraqi Legation credits the Baghdad negotiations theory. Monsieur Kazemi was dismissed from the Ministry of Roads because he was dilatory over the Shah’s trans-Elburz road to his property at Chalus. Now he has again been found not the man to get things cone. 8 The third theory is that the columns of description devoted by the news papers last month to Monsieur Kazemi’s visit to Afghanistan ana India w ich represented him almost as a Royal personage, gave serious offence and thaUhe qVm}, o-iad to find a reason to dismiss him. Either of the other theories could have supplied the reason, and it is also rumoured that Monsieur Kazemi s failure to send instructions as to how discontent in the Persian colony at Kerbela over the unvei^hould be dealt with, reached the Imperial cars Monsieur Kazemi has made’many enemies. I believe that these, and his negatrvn &lt;x,ntrn bntion to the negotiations at Baghdad, account for his fall. Time, if it brings him re-emplovment or imprisonment, will throw further light. _ Meanwhile he is gone and Monsieur Samyi, the new Minister for Foreign Affairs assisted by Monsieur Soheilv and Forouhar, received the Heads of Missions this morning. He received them in pairs which effectually prevented the discussion of business. I synchronised with the Charge d’Affaires of Belgium, in which country Monsieur Sainyi spent twelve vears. His Excellency was rather inarticulately genial ; only common places were discussed, but it struck by Belgian colleague and myself that Monsieur Samyi had been impressed by his period as Persian Minister in Berlin. Monsieur Sanivi comes from an important and even ubiquitous family m Bilan His cousin is the prudent and unambitious Master of the Imperial Court. I have heard the new Minister described as human and a haid vorkei\ . His Majesty’s Ambassador in Baghdad will know more about him. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs seem glad to have him as their Head. 9. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the (fnverument. of India (No. 76). r (34) Despatch from His Majesty’s Oharge d’affaires, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 96, dated the 22nd February 1936. In continuation of my despatch No. 48 (118!3|36) of the 25th January last, I have the honour to inform you that although the local press have maintained an unbroken silence an the arrests, I have gathered the following information from various sources which I believe to be correct. 2. A number of further arrests have been made : in one or two cases former employees of the Ministry of Roads and Communications have been induced to return from abroad by various promises and have been arrested on arrival. The accused persons are being interrogated, and more and more persons are being implicated ; one story even says that members of the_ Court are involved. I have heard from several sources, and responsible Iranians give credence to the story, that one of the minor persons arrested, named Muhammad Ali Valch, chief accountant of the Road Department for Mazanderan, was tortured to death in prison, his corpse being handed over to his friends with the story that he had died of apoplexy. Mansur seems to be accused largely by Ali Asghar Taleghani, an employee in the Ministry of Finance for many years, and sometime G-overnor of Bushire ; Taleghani is a fellow-prisoner of Mansur, and is presumably endeavouring to clear himself by accusing the other. According to one report, Mansur has not been proved guilty of corrupt practices ; but the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, in conversation with the Oriental Secretary to-day, said that there seemed no doubt that grave scandals had taken place and many of the accused had confessed to taking huge bribes, so that the Shah himself, who had always had a high opinion of Mansur’s capacity, had reluctantly been obliged to believe that he must have been a knave as he was evidently not a fool. 3. British interests are likely to be directly affected by the arrest of Issa Kooros, one of the two partners in the firm of Kooros Brothers who are well known to the Department of Overseas Trade and have had agencies for several British firms, including Imperial Chemical Industries, for some time. I hear that the other brother, Hassan, was lately arrested in Berlin on a charge of contravention of the rules relating to exchange, and that the Iranian Govern ment have endeavoured, I do not know with what success, to secure his extradi tion on charges connected with the scandals which form the suhiect of this despatch. ^ '(35) Despatch fbom His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehrak, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 169-E., dated the 7th April, 1936.

The general opinion seems to be that officially fixed rates will not affect actual rates at which transport will be effected—except of course in the case of Government goods, and this may possibly be an improvement on commandeering of transport. Chauffeurs cannot be expected to work at a loss, and would no doubt refuse to ply at all in districts where suitable loads for the return trip are not available. 3. “ Le Journal de Teheran ” of 8 th April published an article entitled “ Une Societe pour les Transports ” in which reference is made to the new transport regulations (reported on by His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires) and thef/ I I 1 60 “ettfaiMe une augmlnUtioute 20 poS^nt^ra fate Z les prix indiqnes ci-haut. ^ 7 ) Pour les matieres explosives en outre des prix fixes aux articles 2, 3 e il sera pave un supplement de quinze pour cent. _ __ (81 Les transports postaux sont exempts des dispositions qui precedent et Us sont sounds dun reglement special et Conditions partlculieres relevant des 91 Les prix fixes ci-liaut seront mis en usage dix jours apres la publication de la presente decision mais ne seront pas appliques aux engagements conclus avant la date de cette decision. Foreign (37) Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehrax, to the Office, Loxdox, No. 183, dated the 14th April 1936. T have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a circnlar despatch which I «n addresjng to all His Majesty’s Consular Offices in Iran on the. question of the taking of Bast m His Majesty s Consulates. o TPe wording of this Circular follows exactly that of the draft enclosed hi Mr. Rendel’s letter to me (E.-6()22|5144S34jl935) of March 17th last. 3* I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India No. 92. n ■ 1 ■r ‘ Enclosure to Serial No. (37). Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehrah, to His Majesty’s Consular Officers m Irag, No. 11, dated the 14th April 1936. A case arose last vear in which one of His Majesty’s Consuls in Iran was asked bv some local merchants and ecclesiastics whether he would be prepared to allow them to take bast in the Consulate should they wish to do so. Their obiect was understood to be to register a protest against the existing political reaime In view of this: and of the length of time since any question of baft has arisen I consider it advisable to issue the following instructions tor the general guidance of His Majesty’s Consular officers in Iran. o In anv such case you should follow closely the instructions in Foreign Office'circular despatch of the 13th February, 1932 (W. 14443|13880!50), but it is necessary to consider how for Iran can be considered to be a country in which a special usage exists within the meaning of that circular. Although bast is an ancient custom formerly recognised both by the Persian Government and His Majesty’s Government, no recent cases have occurred an d it is probable that the present Iranian Government would hold the view that the practice of taking bast is no longer recognised. On the other hand, there can be little question but that the custom of asylum is familiar to the Per sian people and likely to be adopted by them in times of peril or civil commotion in the future as in the past, and it might prove embarrassing to His Majesty s Legation if His Majesty’s Minister or one of His Majesty’s Consuls were forced to surrender a refugee in circumstances which public opinion would regard as a betrayal of a natural trust. Accordingly, while it will bq prudent to'proceed as far as circumstances permit on the assumption that since the reor ganisation of the country by the present Shah, the continued existence of a special usage has not been definitely established, it will equally be desirable to avoid making any definite admission that the right to grant bast is no longer claimed. 3 j n C ase, therefore, a political refugee succeeds in taking bast with you, you should do your utmost to avoid basing a refusal to surrender him upon the argument that such a usage still exists. You should in fact act in accordance wiTh the principles set out in paragraph 4, rather than in. paragraphs 5 and 6 , of the Foreign Office, circular of the 13th February, 1932, subject to the proviso that you may, in any case where you think that danger to life is involved, refuse to surrender the refugee, even to the properly constituted authorities, until you have cought and received my instructions by telegram. It is noteasv to lay flown in advance any rule by which to decide whether actual danger to life ovists and it would seem that such decisions can only be taken on the merits and circumstances of each individual case, giving perhaps the benefit of the doubt to the petitioner in cages where the presence of such danger appears likely without being absolutely proven. 4 . Whether the usage of bast exists or not, however, it is clear that the answer to any enquiries such as those mentioned above must invariably be on emphatic negative. There must exist no ground for an accusation by the Iranian Government that one of His Majesty’s Consuls is encouraging Iranians to take bast, or undertaking to grant it in advance in hypothetical circumstances. chh’iSTwitir'tiie object of taking bast, you may afford them protection to the extent indicated in the preceding paragraph.

I have embodied the notes on organization and other technical matters in an appendix. Much of this information was given to me yesterdav bv the Minister of Mar at an interview for which I asked. After expressing- mv gratitude at being invited to witness the review, the regret of the remainder of the staff of the legation at being prevented from accepting the invitation owin- to Court mourning and my admiration of the parade, I told His Excellencv that, as this was the first time I had been privileged to come within a kilometre ot the Iranian Army, T thought that the occasion called for a fuller report than J • w 1 as a ”T to ronder and ask e d His Excellency to be so good as to furnish m- with sufficient detail to prevent me miscalling a battalion a regiment or confus- ing house artillery with field.

The troops were drawn up on two sides of a square, the civilian elements and the infantry facing South and the cavalry and artiUery facing West, ilm limitations of space, the great strength of the parade and the desire to gt an rspectetors as close a view as possible had forced the general staff to adojit. a verv close immobile and cumbersome formation. So crowded were the can ons units that in order to avoid confusion those on the inner flanks must have reached their alignments at least two hours before. The troops were weai- in' sreateoats but the lot of the Girl Guides and Boy Scouts, clad in the flimsies, of” twill, can hardly have been enviable. At 2-30 p.m. His Imperial Majesty The Shah arrived in a Bolls Royee limousine which vintage. A driver and footman -sat in front but His Imperial J was not accompanied by any A.-D.-G. or equerry. After alighting from his car His Imperial Majesty mounted his charger (a nice looking Turcoman A s crossbred grey 15-2 hands) and rode off to inspect the troops accompanied by the Acting Minister of War, the Chief of the General Staff and four principal staff officers. His Imperial Majesty only rode along the front rank of each side of the square. The troops cheered. After this inspection, which las ed less than ten mimites, His Imperial Majesty rode back to his pavilion, dis mounted and. after a short interval, appeared on the balcony and turned towards the Diplomatic Corps and acknowledged the salutes of that body. He then retired inside the pavilion and emerged at 3-0 p.m. accompanied by the Qi.een and the two elder princesses (Shams Pahlevi, aged 18 and Ashraf Pahleu, aged 16) His Imperial Majesty who appeared in excellent health and spirits, was, as always* dressed in uniform with a military great coat. The two princesses, who seemed entirely self-possessed, were very smartly turned out in well cut, dark green girl guide’s uniforms. Her Majesty was less happily garbed in that type of ensemble indissolubly associated with the works of Mr. George Belcher. At six minutes past three fiftyfonr aeroplanes (Hawker ‘ Andax ’ and ‘ Tb-er ’ Moth) appeared from the East and flew Westward over the pa^acte ground at right-angles to the saluting base. They flew at an altitude of 1,000 in eight flights, the first of five and the remainder of seven machines. The loi- mation aimed at consisted of a double arrowhead of three machines each witn the flight lieutenants machine as a pivot in the centre. Owing to the cmna and the rising wind, flying conditions may not have been good but the formation was ragged and it was very noticeable how most of the machines seemed to 6 erolling through an angle of almost 40°. At a quarter past three fourteen more machines ( &lt; Moths ’) flew over in two flights. The total number of machines on parade was, therefore, sixty-eight. In these there were no Hawker ‘ Furies ’ as, on hearing of the crash of one of their number on the 22nd February while practising aerobatics for the parade, His Imperial Majesty had expressly for bidden their participation in the display, as also any form of “ stunting After the aeroplanes had left, His Imperial Majesty was joined on the balcony by tiie Minister of Education. A military band took up a position facing the pavilion and about 100 yards distant from it and struck up a inarch. The march past then started. The order of units was as follows :— (i) 37 Troops of Girl Guides. The average strength of a troop was 25. The salute was taken by the elderprinces. (ii) 63 Troops of Boy Scouts of an average strength of 20 per troop. Both these and the Girl Guides were drawn from the Primary schools of Tehran with one selected troop from each province of Iran. (ni) Students from the secondary schools, aged 13 to 18. 75 platoons- of an average strength of 40. These latter were the national students’ uniform consisting of a grey flannel suit and a blue chauffeur’s cap. (iv) The cadets of the military school. 19 platoons of an average strength of 60. (?;) Three platoons of the Iranian Navy—average strength 60. One platoon was drawn from the Caspian Division, the other two from the Persian Gulf Division. (vi) Four platoons of the Iranian Air Force of average strength of 70. (vii) Two battalions of engineers, one from the 1st and one from the 2nd Division, (viii) The infantry of the 1st Division consisting of 4 regiments each of 3 battalions. (ix) The infantry of the 2nd Division [composition as in (vin) above.] lx) Light artillery on pack mules (75 m.nv Bofors). One brigade of 6 four-gun batteries from the 1st Division and one similar brigade from the 2nd Division. {xi) Field artillery—seven four-gun batteries of Skoda 105 m.m. guns. (xii) The cavalry school (7 troops). {xiii) Four cavalry regiments. Two from each Division. (xiv) Horse artillery. Three four-gun batteries of Schneider guns. s (xv) Armoured cars. {xvi) Mechanized field artillery. (xvii) Mechanized anti-aircraft artillery. The march past concluded the parade. The decision to eliminate those dis- dnvs which had been such a prominent feature in previous years parades (sucn trlk r'dinv gymnastics, massed physical training and bayonet exercises) was /wise one and the parade lost nothing in impressiveness from being limited to review and march past. The inclusion of such civilian elements as gill gun es, while in keeping with Mea of a nabonal day ^ •p-'illv insnirhm as a proof of what can be done with the youth of Iran, nam nflvsnXl the parade if regarded merely as an exhibition of ceremonial dud. p: f\L inli- the parade went off without a hitch speaks highly for the ski l if 1 the 1 staff 'wh en it ^realised that over 25,000 people, 5,000 ammals ami feO motor vehicles took part in the maich past. ,S192FD 6367 Enclosure III to Serial No. (40). APPENDIX. Notes on turn out, drill and organization. (| A. Turn out — 1 . The turn out of the officers was uniformly good, the only fault being in the matter of their saddlery. This was of widely varying types. Huntuv polo, officers parade and troopers types all being represented.' Their bridles and bits similarly varied from light single bridles with a snaffle to heavy head- stalls with double bridles and universal bits. Russian types with clieen' pieces •crossing on the horse’s nose were also seen. 2. The turn out of the men was not good, the wretched state of their boots and puttees being particularly noticeable. Many of them were unshaved. Their great coats resembled that amorphous garment issued to Indian troops. 3. The leather equipment was aggressively new in appearance and had not that well-used, well-kept and “ seasoned ” appearance which we aim at. 4. The mules had not been clipped and hardly a mule passed which had not been rubbed bare of hair in several places by badly fitting saddlery. 5. The horses were in good condition but a bit on the fine side. This was most noticeable among the artillery horses and is not entirely due to feeding but to conformation as well. In order to get a heavier animal the Turcoman-Persian cross is used and any animal with Turcoman blood in him is apt to have a long, tapering back and to run up light behind like a greyhound. The fact that they are not clipped gives them an odd appearance and it takes a long time for the eye to accustom itself to the sight of a set of hairy fetlocks which might belong to a Clydesdale supporting the weedy barrel of a light weight polo pony. B. Drill — The dressing was poor. The marching was bad. The Iranian army marches to a time of 100 to the minute. The step is a mixture of a slow march and a goose-step. The foot is brought up with the knee bent and is stamped on the ground well in advance of the body. The only way of making this move ment smart would be to insist on a rigid and erect body carnage. T ns is n ° done and the result is grotesque, each man seeming to “ give ” at the waist as if attacked with a sudden spasm of lumbago. 0, Organization — 1 Enaineers—These were in 13 strong platoons of 70 each with an addi- tionai ptfooTof 32 men with 32 males loaded with tools Tins or^mza mn does not tally with that given in my Order of Battle for 193o but was pro - ably modified for ceremonial purposes. 2.

Four tenders. &lt;41) Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 219, dated the 1st May 1936. I have the honour to submit the following observations on events during the period since His Majesty’s Minister went on leave at the end of January, with special reference to British interests. By the end of January the Gorich Kolag incident on the frontier between India and Iran had passed from the wires to the pigeon-hole, but it had been symptomatic of the unsatisfactory state of affairs in East Iran, th.e other aspects of which His Majesty’s Minister had taken up individually and comprehensively with the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. 2. Soon after Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen had left, the Ministry promised better things for the future as regards the treatment of Indian pilgrims, and actually gave redress for the past in one case in which the Legation had made special representations. There had hardly been occasion to test their general promise before the Persian Government precluded any such test by closing the frontier to pilgrims for the two months of Muharram and Safar without warning or explanation. The reason proved to be the fear that veiled Indian women appearing at the sacred shrine in Meshed among their compulsorily unveiled Iranian sisters would lead to misunderstandings and invidious comparisons of a dangerous character. Lhe fact that no advance notice was given to us was due to the timidity, suspicion, and disingenuousness of the late Minister for Foreign Affairs. The fall of Monsieur Kazemi, who had given so many proofs of bad faith and ill-will towards us is undoubtedly food for satisfaction and for hope- As regards other Indian troubles, there has been some promise but little fulfilment, the lorry drivers of 1934 and 1935 are still uncompensated ; in particular the position of the Indian trader, as of all private traders in this country, has recently been made extremely pre carious bv the Government’s policy of giving monopoly rights to big Companies and by the impracticability and cumbrous working of the new law for the control of foreign exchange. Methods of giving further help to British Indians are under active consideration between the Government of India ILa Majesty’s Legation and His Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorassan. LS192FD3. Apart from East Persia and the continued enforced boycotting of; His Majesty’s Legation and Consulates by official and private persons, the posi tion of* British interests is not unsatisfactory. On the Persian Gulf thetre has; been quiet. Mr. Fraser, Deputy Chairman of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, told me just before leaving Tehran that the Shah and the Minister of Finance* had both been cordial, that the Persians had played up well in working his Company’s revised Concession, and that he left with a clean slatu; Mr.. Fraser however, was in poor health and anxious to get away and there seems no doubt that he painted too bright a picture. The local Manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran, has also worked on terms of trust and intimacy with Monsieur Daver, and has no reason to be dissatisfied with the Bank’s position. Kerman has been ruined by the Government’s commercial policy and the Branch there is to be closed, but the local Manager in prosperous Isfahan, feels himself, and seems on velvet. The Stuart Memorial College, or Dabiristan Adab, and the Mission Hospital in Isfahan have their anxieties but they enjoy the respect and confidence of the active Minister of Education and the former provides a stream of recruits of fair quality to the Oil Company and the Imperial Bank, and probably also to the Persian Administration. Messrs. Hawkers personnel, and their machines are weathering difficult conditions well, and Messrs. Paltts’ fitters in the textile factories in and around Isfahan are earning good wages and giving a good account of themselves. British traders, It is true, are up against monopoly and exchange restriction difficulties, but these are common to the traders of most countries except Germany and Russia which have special agreements with the .Persian Government, and, on the other side of the picture, an important Government company is seeking to become agent for Imperial Chemical Industries for Government business. 4. On the major question of the Perso-Iraqi frontier dispute, by the middle of, January the Persian Government had abandoned their objection to His Majesty’s Government participating in the negotiation and signature of a tripartite convention for controlling the Shatt-El-Arab, and had declared them selves ready to agree to British participation provided that the Iraqi Govern ment proposed it to them. The Persians have argued that it is clearly for the country presently occupying the river, and allied to the British, to make the proposal ; it is possible that they fear Soviet resentment were they themselves to take the initiative. Three months have passed and the Persian Govern ment adhere to this position. Our own declarations seem effectually to have forestalled any disposition to hold His Majesty’s Government’s desire to par ticipate in a tripartite convention responsible for the failure hitherto to reach agreement on the frontier question generally. Seeing motes more readily than beams, the Persians’ criticism would rather be that His Majesty’s Government have interpreted in a rigid, niggardly and qven: egotistic spirit Sir R. Clive’s* promise to Teymourtache in 1929 that His Majesty’s Government would give their good offices towards the remedying of Persia’s practical difficulties on the Shatt-El-Arab. The men about the Shah including, I have gathered, the Turkish Ambassador with whom His Majesty is specially intimate, have blamed His Majesty’s Government for the deadlock. His Majesty’s inaccess ibility makes it difficult to put the other side of the picture to him, but I incline to doubt whether his penetrating mind has seriously been led astray. 5. For the rest, the relations between His Majesty’s Legation and Ministry of Foreign Affairs are reasonably good. A revived and seemingly gratuitous offensive against the dissemination outside the Legation of the British Official Wireless news (and the German also) has been conducted with out acrimony and may, I hope, be tided over. 6 . The social feature of the last quarter has been the- unveiling campaign which the Shah supervised personally and which now seems to have achieved success but at a price of lacerating many feelings. Some experienced judges believe that by this and other measures the Shah is storing up after his death a fierce reaction and that this may involve His Majesty’s Legation, popularly held responsible for the Pahlevi regime. On the other hand, British Indian subjects have continued comparatively unmolested to wear the dress they please, and this ma\ ha^ e led the common people to make deductions not un favourable to the British. In the light of the above, there may even by advantage in the Shah being a little remote from His Majesty’s Legation and, choosing his closest confidante from another Mission. Rumours, moreover,, persist of serious indignation among Army officers at their treatment bv the- 'Shah. Jt+ • 7 ;, Tn w01 ' ld , affairs th e Persian Government has remained anti-Italian It is the resolute moves of the other European Dictator that are more likelv to influence tne Shah Signs are not wanting, and will be discussed m a later despatch, of a successful revival of enterprise on the part of Germany For the moment, however, the Shah’s eyes aie likely to be fixed on Egypt where a young king in his teens succeeds an elderly father. 8 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, No. 108 and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad JSlo. 35. 6 (42) Telegram from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, No. 112 (R), dated the 18th April 1936.

(43) Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 126, dated the 14th March 1936. In your despatch No. 9 of the 7th January enclosing correspondence with the Department of Overseas Trade and Messrs. Frank Strick you instructed •me to furnish a full report on the present position as regards the importation of goods through the ports of Bandar Shahpur and Khorramshahr respectively, and my observations on the desirability of making representations to the Iranian Government regarding conditions at the former port, bearing in mind the considerations set out in Foreign Office Memorandum No. E.-6984|6984|34 of the 9th December. Messrs. Strick in their letter of the 19th November had asked that His Majesty’s Government should represent to the Iranian Government the unsatisfactory state of affairs at Bandar Shahpur partly at least on the ground that this must have an adverse influence on trade to the port, which, so Messrs. Strick alleged the Iranian Government had created to handle all imports to Iran. 2 . On receipt of your despatch I invited His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwazr to report on the whole subject, and I now have the honour to enclose herein a copy of his reply which appears to state the facts fully. 3. These show that whatever future intentions may be as regards Bandar Shahpur, the Iranian authorities are not at present making it the sole port for imports. There is moreover, as I reported in my Secret telegram No. 87 of the 2nd March, good reason to believe that the development of the port on a big scale has been shelved, probably for at least two years until the financial position of the Shah’s Government has been put into a sounder position. I understand that a representative of a Netherlands group who had drawn up ambitious development plans for Bandar Shahpur has remained there with instructions to design on a much more modest scale. I would further remind you that His Majesty’s Minister reported in his telegram No. 42 a remark of the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of the Shatt-el-Arab to the effect that the Iranian Government had their own plans for the develop ment of Khorramshahr. * 4 . As regards paragraph two of the Foreign Office Memorandum you will observe thatMhe facts and figures given by Mr. Watkinson demonstrated first that British vessels can and do use Khorramshahr considerably more than Bandar Shahpur ; and secondly that those calling at Bandar Shahpur almost without exception have already proceeded or will proceed to Khorramshahr. I have no evidence as to loss of cargo to rivals caused by using the latter port ; it is however probable that Messrs. Strick’s vessels are made to suffer delay m discharge at Bandar Shahpur through priority being given to vessels (mainly German) bringing equipment for the Shah’s military -forces. It is not possibletn tirevetd fins practice, tot it appears that two 300-ton barges are being: acquired for the port which, it may be hoped, will improve the unsatisfactory position, 5 In the above circumstances, reasons in favour of diplomatic representa- tions to the Iranian Government do not in my judgment &lt;^t which would, outweigh the objection referred to in paragraph two of the Foreign Office Memorandum, it is indeed possible, in view partly of their new policy 01 reducing expenditure, that the Iranian Government would resent representa tions on the subject of Bandar Shahpur unless these were confined to very minor details of Port administration, such as control of coolies and the dearth of lighters. I would also draw attention to considerations arising from the nnrl 12th nsraaraDlis of Mr. Watkinson’s despatch. 6 I should add that I am considering separately the state of affairs on the Karun river referred to In paragraph 9, and that I hope to discuss shortly with Mr. Fraser of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company the subject raised m the 11th paragraph, 7. I am sending a copy of this and of Mr. Watkinson’s despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad No. 21. Enclosure to Serial No, (43). Despatch from His Majesty’s Consul, Ahwaz,_to His Majesty’s Charge' d’affaires, Tehran, No. 13, dated the 27th February 1936. With reference to your despatch No. 3 (111[3136) of February 4, 1936,- regarding the port of Bandar Shahpur, I have the honour to report that, so far as^I am aware, that port neither is nor ever was “ the official port of discharge for all merchandise “ destined for Iran ”, as stated by Messrs. F. C. Strick and Company in their letter of November 19 last to the Department of Overseas Trade. Much of the information contained in the Department of Overseas Trade Memorandum No. 1503511935 of December 19 is also^ quite out of date. If the word “ an ” were substituted for the word “ the ” in Messrs. Strick’s letter, the statement would be correct, as Bandar Shahpur is now supposed to be equipped to deal with all types of cargo, whereas formerly only military and other Government stores and railway material were landed there. 2. What Messrs. F. C. Strick and Company no doubt mean is that every effort* has been made during the last year to induce importers to use the port of Bandar Shahpur as is evident from the instructions to shippers in the- United Kingdom referred to by the Foreign Office in paragraph 2 of their despatch No. 9, of January 7. That these instructions have not had any appreciable effect is shown by the statistics of ships calling and imports at Bandar Shahpur and at Khorramshahr during 1935, which are attached. 3. Of the 32 British vessels which landed cargo at Bandar Shahpur, 24 belonged to the Strick Line or Eherman’s City Line and associated lines, while 172 British ships called at Khorramshahr during the same period, of which Messrs. Strick’s agent dealt with over 50. Since last October, the British India Steam Navigation Company’s “ Slow Mail ” steamer has called once a month at Bandar Shahpur, landing a very small amount of cargo. Almost without exception, all British vessels calling at Bandar Shahpnr before or after discharging there proceeded to Korramshahr. Most other vessels also called at both ports or at Basra to pick up return cargo. 4. The vast hulk of cargo dealt with at Bandar Shahpur consists of shipments of military and railway material by the Hansa Line boats, which call there twice a month and sometimes more often. Japanese vessels, for which the Hansa Line representative acts as clearing agent, come next m importance, landing cement for railway construction and small consignments of general merchandise. ✓ 5. Facilities for handling importations at Bandar Shahpur are as described by Messrs. Strick and Company. The one small jet tv is in need of repair ; a somewhat antiquated steam crane is used on a truck which is run up and down the railway between Bandar Shahpur and Salchabad mostly, at the behest of the military authorities : two very inadequate old lighters, which T believe were supplied bv Messrs. Strick themselves, are shortly, it is said, to he increased to five ; the rate o^ 1 discharge is most unsatisfactory and ?f more than one vessel is there at a time there is every sort of irregularity,priority being in any case always demanded for military stores. The coolies are under the sole control of the Customs Department, which is not always a satisfactory arrangement. 6 . The authorities who are aware of this state of affairs at the Port, which was created with a view to handling all imports by the Persian Gulf, are now for the most part in prison. Nonsense is from time to time published in the press about this up-to-date modern port, and it is not long ago since I heard that one of the Deputies for Ahwaz refused to believe that there is no public telephone nor Post Office at Bandar Shahpur, He had not been to see. Many .schemes have been produced but nothing whatever is done. There is not even any fresh water at Bandar Shahpur yet, which is indispensable before any serious improvements can be carried out, I was in Bandar Shahpur about a month ago and I could see no change whatever in the appearance of the place compared with two years ago, 7 . Since the Customs tire at Khorramshahr last August, the Ahwaz Customs House has been open to deal with a limited amount of up-country traffic, under the direction of the Provincial Director at Khorramshahr. More ’recently importers and shipping agents have been informed verbally that the Customs Office at Ahwaz is open for all purposes, and through cargo has now been accepted here for some time, though no public notice seems to have been issued to that effect. Probably the Customs Department dare not issue such a notice as it would destroy the effect of the Bandar Shahpur propaganda which is by order of the All Highest. More- recently still, the office of the Provinciar Director of Customs at Khorramshahr Iras been abolished. At present the local Directors of Customs at Ahwaz and at Khorramshahr have bach been placed directly under the Customs Department in Tehran and both the premises and staff at Ahwaz have been increased with a view to dealing with more through cargo here, 8 Whether this state of affairs will continue, which is welcomed by the local merchants and forwarding agents for firms in the interior depends partly on the settlement of another problem winch has been created by the -Nava Authorities. 9. A notice was issued some time ago by the Khorramshahr Naval Port Office which claims to have jurisdiction over all traffic on the Biver Kanin as as Ahwaz to the effect that the total breadth of tugs and barges may not exceed U meters. This makes it impossible to tow even one barge alongside a tu«' Hitherto the Anglo-'Iranian Oil Company, the Iran Transport Company (Mesopotamia Iran Corporation), and others have heeh towg barges to^ nnd to starboard and sometimes others astern. The Imperial Iranian Navy C decided that, in future, they should all he toved astern whrch is faid to^be iumraeficable cwiim to the shallows and bends m the river.

A picture of Bandar Shahpur would not be complete without reference to the local representative of the Hansa Line, a German called Wengoborsky, who has spent most of his time there during the last year or more. He has considerable influence there and it is largely due to him that the Port Services function at all. He is the only European permanently connected with the place and is in close touch with his colleague, another German,, at Bushire. Both of them are familiar ^ith the whole coast and hinterland. Reference to their activities has been made from time to time in my monthly Diary. Mr. Wengoborsky, for reasons of his own, personal, commercial, and possibly others* would much like to see i nprovements at Bandar Shahpur* for which he would no doubt claim much of the credit. It is not improbable that he himself inspired Messrs. Srricks to refer the subject to London. 13. A question which should be considered in connexion with this latest problem of the Persian Gulf is perhaps, fherefqre, not so much the risk of losing trade to our rivals, who already have most of it in their hands for reasons well known to those at home, but of giving political support to other interests should British shipping be led to concentrate entirely on the Shatt-al-Arab. 14. I enclose a spare copy of this despatch in case it may be of interest to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad to whom I normally send direct copies? of all reports on commercial subjects.

Mh-l, 2&amp;th April, 1936. (44) Despatch erom His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 160, dated the 3rd April 1936. oo c 1 ' eontil ™ati 0 n of my despatch No. 96 (118|6!36) [Serial No. ( 35)1 of the _-nd Febiuaij last, I have the honouir to inform you that a very long report on S Wlt]l . llle Ministery of Roads and Communications was published m the local press just before the No Ruz festival ; perhaps it mav have been responsible for the general gloom which was very apparent in the salaams held on that usually joyous occasion I P 1 m me tbo f'n 111 ! ,T W ?• I. he leilgth n of . the re P° rt 1 do not Propose to trouble you with the lull text, which appeared piece-meal in French in the Journal de Teheran on the 20th, 25th, 26th and 27th of March. I give below a summary of the mam points of the report, which was signed by the four members of the special sub-cominission of the Ministry of Justice appointed to examine the accusations and report to the Majlis. . . 3 ; In n } e first place, says the report, the dossiers examined show that the Ministry of Roads and Communications, during the tenure of office of Ali Mansonr was in a very bad state ; all sorts of irregularities were going on, and the Minister not only reaped considerable profit therefrom himself, but was responsible, whether he knew what was going on or not, for the faults of his subordinates. A catalogue of the names of the latter then follows, with a summary of the matters proved against them. Mohammad Nabavi, Ezzatollah, Hedayat and Hossein Ali, Moylavi confess, to having taken 600,000 rials from the representative of the Societe Hollandaise in connection with the construc tion of the new Port at No Shahr. Movlavi says that he paid 65,000 rials of his share to Soltan Mohammad Ameri. Ali Asghar Taleghani,. administrative director of the Sentab Company, says that he paid 150,000 rials to Mansonr as an inducement to him to sanction contracts for the construction of bridges. He also confesses to having paid 160,000 rials to Amir Aslani, and 40,000 rials to Soltan Mohammad Ameri. Ezzatollah Hedayat confesses to receiving 98,000 rials from the Dutch Company. Amir Aslani received 510,000 rials from various persons. Hossein Ali Movlavi received 250,000 rials. Reza Gholi Senahi and Soltan Mohammad Ameri received further large sums ‘d’une facon illicite’. Ali Akbar Pakzad extracted from the sub-Contractors for the Chains road 110,000 rials. Hassan Ghezel Ayagh received 7,000 rials. Vossough went half shares with Movlavi in 50,000 rials, and also received 83,000 rials from throf' Europeans. Hassan Pour Sardar, of the Mazanderan Road Department, extracted 90,000 rials from contractors ; Mohammad Ali Shaibani made ‘ large sums ’ ; Moazedi, an Accountant made about 70,000 rials ; Kamram extracted large sums from the treasury of the Ministry, but alleges that he paid 50,000 rials a month for eighl months to General Ayrom, head of the Police ; Hassan Yamini took large sums from the contractors in Gurgan.4. Ali Mansour, says the report, was or ought to have been cognisant of all these irregularities. He also bought a yacht for the Imperial Court from the Dutch company without putting' the matter up to tender at all, and when the inspection department of his Ministry drew his atiention to ii regularities he took no notice ; in fact he dissolved that department. 5. The report then proceeds to a very long discussion of the three main accusations against Mansour, which are briefly as follows,. Firstly 5/ Mansour took 150,000 rials from the Sentab Company in connection with the construction of the new bridge from Ghazian to Pahlevi. The proof of this reads as though Taleghani were the prosecuting party, Mansour denying always, and the sub commission supporting Taleghani. Secondly, Mansour contracted with the German Company Chiehav to purchase a dredger for the port of No Shahr at a price of 21 , 000,000 rials, without proper adjudication or tender, thereby causing the Government a loss of 900,000 rials. He also caused the Government a loss of 48,000,000 rials in exchange. It appears that a German company named Lopiker had made an offer, previously to that of Chicharg to supply the dredger at a much lower price ; and that Mansour. had not insisted on the successful company’s employing the sum received in the purchase of Iranian exports. Therefore, Mansour contributed largely to the regrettable crise des devises h At the end of a long argument on these points _ the loss to the Govemment on exchange is restated as 4,800,000 rials, showing that a cypher seems to have gone astray during the argument. The third item concerns the contract for the construction of the Port of No Shahr ; Mansour received, through the agency of Mohammad Nabavi, a large bribe from the Dutch company. 6 . So far, the only direct interest which His Majesty’s Government have in the matter is the fact that the accused Minister is the holder of a Britisn order given him for help accorded by him to our interests during the war. But; in the same issue of the press a further report appears concerning Issa (or Esau) Kooros. The President of the Majlis is reported to have announced that the Public Prosecutor of Jhe ‘ Cour penale des fonetionnaires ’ had sub mitted a report accusing a previous Minister of Roads and Communications, Reza Afshar, of demanding and accepting a bribe of 32,000 rials from Issa Kooros in connection with the purchase of explosives. The purchase price amounted to 1.600,000 rials, and the Minister demanded three per cent. Kooros. finally agreed with him for two per cent. (The exact amount, I understand, of his o&gt;yn commission from Imperial Chemical Industries) and paid it to Afshar in two instalments. The payment was inscribed in the books of Kooros Brothers as a personal drawing in the name of Issa and his brother Hassan Kooros. This accusation was duly submitted to the examination of the Majlis * commission de la justice ’. 7. It does not therefore appear that the Kooros Brothers are accused of anything more serious than the transference to Afshar of the commission which they themselves were personally entitled to. in order not to lose the order. Nevertheless I have heard rumours that the Kooros Brothers intend to leave' Iran as soon as they are in a position to do so, and to carry on their business elsewhere. 8 - It now remains to be seen what sentences will be pronounced upon the accused persons by the proper courts. The evidence, as published, looks black, though we have not yet heard what the defence is. The accused will of course be confronted with the impossible task of proving themselves innocent before a court which has determined already to find them guiltv—in fact has probably already been instructed what punishment to inflict. The Shah will thus make it clear that only one person in this country is allowed to make unlimited profits ; and the dutiful press will treat us to the usual outbursts of sanctimonious banalities. It seems clear that large sums of money have been paid by Foreign Companies (not British) for contracts in Iran ; the companies perhaps regard ing them as a part of the price, and the recinients as a legitimate or customarv commission, useful for keeping pace with a high cost of living on a very small salary. 9 9. I should perhaps add that not all of the persons who have been in prison for some time on account of these scandals anpear in the report ; a notable exception is Abdullah Nabavi. It remains to be seen whether any action will he taken against the bribing companies ; for according to the criminal code the giver, as well as the receiver, of a bribe is guilty of an offence-10 . As regards Kampsax, the most important foreign concern engaged in the work of improving communications, I learn that Monsieur Saxild was received in audience by the Shah shortly before No Raz and that His Imperial Majesty told him that, while the Company enjoyed his entire confidence, they must be more careful in future in engaging and controlling their subordinates. (45) Despatch from the Commercial Secretary to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade, No. (B.)-80, dated the 8th May 1936. With reference to my despatch Overseas Trade (B.)-241 of October 14,1935 [Serial No. (91) in F. No. 27-NJ35], I have the honour to inform you that the laying of rails on the Northern Section of the Translranian Railway has now reached Firouz Kuh, at Kilometre 237 from Bandar Shah. 2. His Imperial Majesty the Shah left Tehran for Firouz Kuh on 24th April accompanied by Her Majesty the Queen and the two Royal Princesses. Photographs of the Rnyal Train in which the party travelled to Shahi were published in the local press of 26th April. I understand that the laying of the rails up to Firom Kuh was completed only about a week before His Majesty’s arrival. The line is, it appears, exploited up to Doab at Kilometre 191, only service trains are as yet running regularly up to Firouz Kuh. The sections between there and Tehran—about 200 kilometres are expected to be completed by May 1937. Work is in full swing on the construction of the Station at Tehran. 3 On the Southern section work is progressing slowly owing to the amount of difficult tunnelling to be done in lots 6 to 11. Service trains run regularly up to Kala Sheikh at kilometre 307, but merchandise from the Gulf ports is only transported up to Salehabad where it is transferred to lorries. This system will have to continue till trains can run through to Bahrein (kilometre 461) where the railway alignment again approaches the high road. 4 . Work has been started on the comparatively flat stretches between Tehran and Qum : between Qum and Bahrein the country is also fairly easy and I understand only one tunnel is likely to be necessary. The Southern Section is expected to be completed towards the middle ot IJoJ. 5. A copy of this despatch is being sent to :— The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India under No. C. 6 .

The first point has also been made in the introductory remarks in the Annual Report for ].93o and would be admitted by many Iranians, but it is reasonable to hope that (ipality will improve along with the general amelioration of the standard of education.

Assadullah Mirza, Shaihab-ud- Dowleh, K.C.v .0. only just avoided dismissal by persuading his Sovereign! that these men were outside his governorate and within that of Kurdistan. &amp; . 3* I leave Iran liaving seen the discarding of the Pahlevi cap and the impo sition ot the European dress m many of its most debased forms upon dwellers of towns, villages, hemlets and hovels indiscriminately. The measure has been imposed by officials, police and even by the military with every means in their power. The more noticeable change, not yet fully completed,' is the unveiling of the women, with the officially inspired campaign against the “ chuddur ”. If the Persian press is full of accounts of the ardour of its womanhood in adopting the new dress, it naively omits to note that there are to-day in the provinces only a very few women to be seen in public. Prejudice against unveiling and the lack of means of providing any form of European dress account for this. 4. I believe that the policy of presenting the Persian to appear outwardly as a European is inspired by the hope that he will acquire inwardly those good qualities of the West which will lead to his national and personal improvement. But plus ca change, plus c’est la meme chose is true of the majority. The East moves slowly. Yet if the change had not been forced upon the people in haste it could not have been imposed at all. The Persian, given a delay, would have hoped for some intervention before the expiration of the time limit. 5. Government in the present form and under the strong ruler seems firmly established. A soldier himself the Shah is said to have full control of the Army and whilst he commands the only field from which a rival may rise there seems no danger to him from any other direction. 6. Complaints are heard against Government from time to time. These are the inevitable result of measures to secure increased revenue for the needs ■of the fighting services and of the civil administration. The merchant class in general is dissatisfied with the restrictions on trade and the intervention of government as a trader. But as individuals, many recognise that they are pay ing in taxation no more than they and their fathers paid to the Prince Governors General in the past. Also that they are now living under more favourable con ditions of security. And all educated classes realise with pride that the work of progress has been carried on without binding the country with foreign loans. 7. The mujtehid and ulema are the class most affected by the new regime. The large revenue they derived as civil registrars has been lost to them with the foundation of the registration department. The abolition of public reli gious practices, such as the Muharrem ceremonies, &amp;c., and the studied indiffer ence shown towards religion are depriving them of all influence and prestige. As a class they are a potential danger to the regime if a strong leader snould appear from their ranks. The ruler is well aware of this and will taxe measures to guard against it. 8. My impression is that the Shah commands the fear of all his subjects and in the East this means their allegiance and respect. His work m waking up the country and of pulling out the fighting services and the civil admimstra- tion from the‘ruts of indifference and sloth is recognised by all. His policy loi industrial development is admired. The activities which have made him the West landowner and industrialist m Iran and the large fortune he has acquired receive no condemnation. In fact, I am convinced that he would have earned the odium of his subjects if he had failed to take advantage of opportunities. o Even in the provinces one gathers the impression that great progress has been addled in He Army. .

Security exists, with a few inci en ^ t p e Amnieh upon sSr than the revenue levied upon the same people by tribal chieftains in the past.11. The Police services in the towns appear efficient and the discipline of the force is good. Burglaries are on the decrease. 12. The dVil administration in all its branches has made large strides towards efficiency but many of the services are still backward. The difficulty appears to lie in the lack of attraction to the educated young man of the lower r inks of this service. The pay and conditions here are poor. The junior offi- e a ls are therefore as a rule persons of little education who are marking time in the position until they can find more remunerative employment elsewhere. 13 It is not easy either to find suitable candidates for the higher ranks, e n heads of departments, assistant governors, &amp;c., and many of those hold ing the positions are venal unless under immediate control. I have heard the Tito Governor-General of Pars complain that the difficulty m administration was the' Set'of sufficient trustworthy men. H. E. .K^n Ahy was him self a very jrood type of the modern senior Persian official. Educated at ti.o Russian School in Tehran, he studied law in Russia and was a Judge of Appeal before comin^ to Ears. A conscientious, honest and hardworking official lie was the very opposite to his successor Abul Eath Mirza, Dowlat Shalu, a pleasing individual hut a confirmed gambler and spendthrift. But the latter L a representative of the class which owes position to rank and influence. I imagine that he will not hold his position for long as he is being hard pressed by creditors. 14. I have not heard many reports showing the working of the Adliyek, But efforts have been made to improve the status of the judges and I mio'.r rS nr» /■»f»P f 1 ,‘if'Tcint 1111UStlCe. 15 The worst public service appears to he the Post Office, the staff being not only backward but inadequate. The telegraph services have not been brought up to date for external work. In Shiraz tffe whole routine of the office depends upon one man, an Armenian formerly of the I. E. T. Department staff. 16. Good and steady progress is being made with education and the Persian youth of both sexes is now receiving a very fair elementary and middle eciirse education, including physical drill. 17 Many improvements have been made in communications during the last five years. Roads are being maintained and reconstructed. Mechanical Transport on which traffic depends, is under stricter control and the tiaveller is provided with up to date transport. Omnibus services between Bushire- Shiraz-Isfahan cater for the more moderate purse. 18. Town improvements on a fair scale have been undertaken during the last six years and most towns now possess a large central avenue. In Shiraz street making is in progress and sections of the old bazaar are being done away with for the object. The most noticeable work is in Isfahan where some five hundred houses'have been pulled down recently for the Northern extension of the Ohahar Bagh Avenue which will now be joined to the Tehran road. \\ ork of restoration has been undertaken in the Maidan. It is hoped to reconstruct this on the oridnal plan. The madrasseh and the masajid are being suitably repaired. The'town now has 8 spinning mills and the construction of further factories is in contemplation. 19. I am not touching upon commercial, economic or industrial questions in this short report. Reference to these subjects were made in my Summary of Events and Conditions in the Province of Ears for the year 1935. 20. During my stay in Persia I have seen the disarming of the tribes ^ in Kurdistan and the consequent revolt of the Jaf chieftain, Ja. 5 afar Sultan.. This took nearly two years to quell and was followed by the troubles in Buristan. Here the disturbances were due to attempts by government to settle the bars in other districts. The Qashqai and Khamseh tribes had byen disarmed before my arrival in Ears and the last revolt of the Qashqai chi'Than Ali Khan had been suppressed. Saulat-ud-Dowleh had only just died in a Tehran prison and the Qavam-ul Mulk was residing in the capital, as were the principal relatives of both chiefs. The rigid control of the tribes under midtary governors has continued ever since and the project of settlement of the tribes in defined areas, with the abolition of the annual migrations, is materialist ag. All these measures are aimed at the breaking-up of the tribal system. I have not heard of. any strong personality likely to come forward to claim tii j tribal chieftainship i* the opportunity should occur.business with me must first of all exolain it tn th* r peis ^ n 0 b not e having; Governor-General, the MuniM^dX* Police 6 , ficel's, liave been excellent and I have both personally and offioiallv received 1 he most ready arm courteous assistance from the Governor Gel Za tib orally Wver a Gonsul’s official relations xvith Persian official a™ unsatisfac tot\. d ew of these officers will assume any responsibility and every matter however small, must first be referred to the capital.

I. believe that the average Persian knows of two foreign nations only the Russian and the British. To most classes present conditions in the lb S. S. R. are an unsolvabie puzzle but apart from this I do not think that anv Persian feels any sympathy for that country. A friendly feeling for Great Britain does exist but the educated and the nationalist have not forgotten the Anglo- Russian agreement. In Pars too the formation and maintenance of the South Persia Rifles is still fresh in memory. Our'prestige here depends solely upon our foreign policy in general. 24. And in conclusion. I am convinced that the present regime will con tinue with benefit to country and people during the lifetime of the present ruler so long as he retains his mental and physical powers. It would require a bold prophet to forecaste conditions at his disappearance, either in the fulness of time or before, (48) Letter from His Majesty’s Legation, Tehran, to the Eastern Department, the Foreign Office, No. 149|9|36, dated the 14th May 1936.

I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, No. 133. f (51) Despatch from His Majesty's Charge d'affaires, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 246, dated the 16th May 1936. With reference to my telegram No. 138 of 12th May [Serial No. (49)], I have the honour to report that the Valiahd left Switzerland for Iran on 29th April travelling by w T ay of Austria and Hungary, Roumania and Russia. His Imperial Highness seems to have been given every attention by the Soviet authorities ; taking a boat specially put at his disposal at Baku, he reached Pahlevi on 7th May. He proceeded to the Mian-Pochte palace wdiere he was received by the Shah with the Queen and his sisters. 2. The Imperial party spent three days seeing Gilan and Mazanderan, the tw r o most fertile provinces of Persia, the best parts of which have been acquired and developed by the Shah. On the morning of the 10th they arrived with a retinue of cars at i0 o’clock at Chains and inspected a large silk factory under erection by Skoda. The party, consisting of the Shah walkingahead with the Valiahd and a younger brother, and the Queen and two princesses behind them, strolled over the large girder bridge crossing the Chalus river, past the modem hotel built originally for the Shah’s use, and up through the tea garden that surrounds the Shah’s lodge about a quarters of a mile beyond the hotel. The Shah’s imminent arrival had produced feverish activity in the hotel and Chalus generally, but he proved to be in smiling mood. Dwarfing his w T ell growm son, he pointed to some of the works of clearance and development that have been accomplished. His Imperial Majesty has indeed, here and elsewdiere, in the two provinces, much to shew\ Nevertheless, wdiat had happened a few T days previously at Ramsar, the new health resort on the Caspian, is wmrth recording at this point as being perhaps symbolic. Prior to the Shah’s visit, hotel managers were decorating and redecorating their rooms ; their gardeners were planting trees and even running with their large watering cans in hardly Iranian fashion. The Shah arrived ; all except the earth- quaked, and it had torn from it by the Imperial order the trees so lately planted. Then the Shah passed back to Shahsavar. A sigh of relief and exhaustion followed, activity collapsed and Persia returned to its kalian. 3. The afternoon of May 10th was devoted to a visit to the nev T port of Deh No under construction by the Netherland Harbour Works Company some G kilometres from Chalus, and on the following day the party crossed the Elburz by the new 7 Chalus road, en route for Tehran. At Kerej there v r as a reception attended by Ministers, Under-Secretaries, the President of the Chamber and military officers of high rank. Speeches and presentations w r ere made and the students of the Agricultural College marched past. The Imperial party reached a beflagged Capital at 5 o’clock and Boy Scouts and Girl Guides presented bouquets outside the Palace. The next day w T as qpportmiately a Moslem holiday,87 i * Hk v 4. Subsequently the Protocol informed us that the Valiahd would receive the diplomatic body at the (tulistan Palace on May 16th and there took place ims morning what was virtually a repetition of the .No Kuz baiaam wim tue y aCr&gt; r ._ a a ^1% ( ^ i£ 6^ Valiahd replacing his father.

The Valiahd has been away for 5 years at Monsieur CarnoPs school in Switzerland. Me is nearly 17 years old and could succeed to the throne when he is 18. It has of course long been conjectured that the Shah, to give stability to the dynasty would before long introduce him to the work of Govern- ^iiaiiair ttuQfc Epair d&gt;. &amp; a pcrj, g, r. ment. Monsieur Soheily has told me that it is probable that he will not return to Europe and will pursue military studies here, but that no decision has yet been taW. It is too early to estimate popular feeling towards him, thougn his good looks and athletic interests have probably made a favourable impression. What does seem certain is that the Shah is genuinely devoted to him and is well content to have him back in this country. I'^IT tfl 1| 5.

They were never popular with their own trioes who are probably just as happy under the new regime except ior the policy of settling them in fixed and sometimes unsuitable localities, and attempted prevention of the winter and summer migration. Inter-tribal squabbles have been settled by military action or by Amnieh, who have also taken over the functions of the Bakhtiari guards at the Oilfields. The burden of taxation is probably no greater than it was under the Khans and the com parative security reigning to-day may outweigh the unpopularity of conscrip tion and of interference with the old customs:. 5. The tribes of Luristan have gradually been subdued by military action and land distributed to them, often at the expense of Arab owners. .The construction of the railway ,has provided employment for large numbers of Lurs, as has the maintenance of the Khorramabad road. 6 . The Kuhgilu tribes are also subjugated and the district opened up by new roads. 7 . The influence of the present regime on the town dwellers will be dealt with later. Measures against subversive elements have been of the strictest. Various efforts have been reported from time to time to prevent Bahaists from obtaining employment with the railway or with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Jews have found conditions impossible in Mohammerah and have left the country, while it was recently rumoured that none were to be allowed to serve in Government offices. Employees at all frontier posts have in the meanwhile been posted in the interior. The power of the Mullahs has been curtailed in every way and their number reduced by a system of licensing. 8 . Foreign communities have of course felt the hand of Tehran just as much as the Iranian and have perhaps resented it more than . the apathetic native. The Iraqis were thus afraid to hold any mourning ceremony at the time of the death of King Faisal. It is to be regretted that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company saw fit to show similar fear of offending the authorities by outward observances at the time of King George’s death. A leading merchant of Ahwaz is said to have refused the appointment of Honorary Swedish Consul in Ahwaz for fear of reprisal on the part of the authorities. 9. The Shah’s complete lack of consideration for his officials has been exemplified during the last few years by a personal assault on the Assistant Director of the Finance Department on the occasion of his last visit here ; by frequent announcements of his intention to visit the province and failure to do so ; by sudden transfer or suspension of officials on slender pretexts such as- the use of the English word “ foot ” in a telegram which happened to contain news which displeased His Imperial Majesty ; and by the recent dress regula tions for officials and insistence on the immediate spending of their small savings on new clothes. Admiration for the Shah and for the blessings con ferred by the present regime used to be more freely expressed by officials. Even the General Officer Commanding Troops here has been heard to criticise. It is probable that any popularity which the present Government may have had or enthusiasm which it may have inspired is waning rapidly amongst official classes. 10 . Westernising reforms in this part of the country have for the most part come more slowly than in the north, and have perhaps for that reason been accomplished more easily. 11. During the year 1934 the Khuzistan Press was founded. It was suspended for a time owing to the publication of articles about the climate of Ahwaz and the editor was threatened with severe punishment for his feeble eompaign against a Basra newspaper which suggested that Khuzistan was an Arab province. The reply referred to the ancient capitals of Persia at Ctesiphon and Baghdad, and made no attempt to deny the preposterous asser tion that most of the inhabitants^ of Khuzistan are Arabs, as the authorities expected him to do. A cinema with up-to-date equipment v T as also established in the Khuzistan Club during the same year. It later became an independent institution and talkies ” have been shown there since last year. 12. A. great deal has been done by the military authorities and by the education department to stimulate interest in games and athletics. A Football League vas organised by the General Officer Commanding and teams have been to Tehran from Ahwaz. Flat Races have on occasion held up the traffic in the stieets. The latest effort is to make the emancipated Iranian woman ternis- nunded, a task which seems to be beyond the. power even of the General whosoword is law in most matters. A Sports Club has also been established at Khorramshahr. For the most part the Angio-Iranian Oil Company has remained aloof from all these things, though the General has endeavoured to persuade them to send football teams to Ahwaz from Abadan, though “ of course ” his soldiers or railway employees could not go there for return matches. 13. The first far-reaching reform was the abolition of fhe Pahlevi hat. Army Officers first were seen in a soft kepi and sun helmets were issued to the rank and file. It was then announced that all persons working in the sun might wear a sun helmet. The next effort was on motor drivers who were instructed to procure peaked caps of European model. Towards the end of 1934 the wearing of hats inside offices was forbidden. It was not till the summer of 1935, that all officials adopted European hats and received instruc tions not to deal with the public if wearing Pahlevi hats. Regulations were also published as to how to wear and when to remove one’s hat. Various forms of persuasion were used by the Governor-General, the police, and the military—but little force was used except in isolated instances of remonstrance. Special hats of guaint design were ordered for tribesmen and it was found that a Pahlevi hat with the stiffening removed made a graceful “ God blimey ” object which for a time satisfied the Authorities. The Angio-Iranian Oil Company was requested to import hats for the staff, but firmly refused to do so at the same time seeing to it that proper hats were obtained as soon as possible in the bazaar. After three months of quiet persuasion a few arrests were made and from then onwards no more Pahlevi hats were seen. On the whole, the public accepted these changes without much fuss, as it was realised that a* hat with a brim is a more practical article, except for religious observance which is of importance to a very small minority at any rate of town-dwellers. 14. More recently, a limited number of mullahs have been licensed to perform duties entitling them to wear turbans. 15 The women’s turn came in 1935, when school-mistresses and girl students were invited to remove their veils. The wives of all officials were next instructed to conform, but no general attempt was made to coerce the public. Agents and spies were set to guide and report on public opinion an advances of salary were paid to all minor Government employees, while public baths, taxis and bellums were placed out of bounds to veiled womem ere are now practically no veils to be seen m Ahwaz, Abadan or Khorrainshalir The necessitv to provide new hats and clothing in replacement of the chaddur has been TTeve^financial strain on many of populaGon.

The local administration during the past three years has been a Kaleidoscope of varying efficiency and honesty. Governors-General and Governors at Khorramshahr and Abadan have come and gone. The first two Governors-General known to the writer were ex-diplomats. Both, came to grief owing to peculations of subordinates. Since then former officials of the Finance Department have held the post who have shown less social acumen but have perhaps been the better administrators. In practice, the General Officer Commanding Troops has been the power behind when not in front of the scene throughout this period. None of the Governors has ever entertained distinguished visitors, Iranian or foreign who are accommodated in a special railway bungalow or imposed upon the Anglo Iranian Oil Company. In case after case the Governor-General has shown a complete ignorance of what is going on in other Departments, supposedly under his supervision. The military and naval authorities for the most part treat him with disdain and fail to give him any information or help, while the chief of Police on occasion has told a Governor-General to attend to his own affairs. The precise duties of a Governor-General seem to be undefined. Apart from appearance on official occasions and occasional inspections of the more accessible parts of the dislrict, he is merely a post-office for communication with higher or other authorities and has plenty of time to devote to collection of funds for social, charitable and industrial puropses,—earthquakes, floods, school excursions, beggars, swimming baths, factories,—and for exhorting the public to form com panies, to organise industries, and generally to put themselves under the control of the Authorities in their development schemes. 20. The Deputy Governor usually acts as Rais-i-Belledieh as do the sub- Governors of Abadan and Khorramshahr. Since various regrettable incidents in 1933 connected with road-making, municipal services have been maintained as well as funds permit. In Ahwaz the roads have been kept in a tolerable state of repair and decently clean, though reports from Khorramshahr have complained constantly of the state of the one main road through the town. Many new and better houses have been built after submission of plans to the Belledieh. New official premises were at one time under construction surrounded bv a high wall on which eighty thousand rials were said to have been spent. This was solemnly inaugurated by the Governor-General in the presence of all the officials, but work was suspended the following week under instructions from Tehran that all Government buildings must be on the right bank of the River Karun. A Municipal Hospital is now being built there. An ambitious town-planning scheme is also being carried out in connection with the opening of a road to approach the new Bridge over the Karun which is almost completed by the Societe Sentab. It is probable that the bridge will be finished before any approach to it exists at either end. This has necessitated the demolition of the building occupied by the Customs Department and has created great confusion and congestion in the Customs. 21 . The only dealings of this Consulate with the Belledieh have been in connection with prohibited goods confiscated wrongfully from an Indian. This was never settled owing to the Indian’s death, but the judicial authorities have agreed that the cloth forms a part of the estate and it was recently sold by auction and the proceeds are held pending issue of letters of administration. 22. Though nominally under control of the Governor-General, the Police take a line of their own and seek any inspiration required from Tehran. Their administration generally leaves much to be desired, though there are spasmodic attempts at traffic control and inspection of the bazaars. Dealings with the public often require much palm-oil and it is suspected that many of the robberies in the town are carried out with the connivance of the police if not by them. Unnecessary difficulties were made by the Police for American aviators at Khorramshahr and for French ’planes which made forced landings in Ahwaz and Abadan. The obtention of exit visas by foreign subjects is frequently a long and tedious business. This Consulate has had to make representations at different times about the arrest and detention of Indians, impounding of pass ports, non-recognition of proper travel documents, limitation of the period ofvalidity of residence permits and abnormal delay in their issue, confiscation of guns, refusal to give facilities in connection with immigration and visa ret^a tions and the issue of licences for guns. In the first case the arrests were made SafeguaiTNo^G. ^ Searched contrar y ^ the provisions of 23 The present Chief Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police was refused permission to land at Khorramshahr last year because he was not m possession of a visa which he had failed to obtain owing to the Iranhm Consulate at Karachi being closed. Though his identity as ex-Colonial Governor was explained, the Chief of Police insisted that he must continue his journey to Basra and obtain a visa there. Similar difficulties have been -encountered by diplomatic representatives who are told that no police facilities can be given to piesons with diplomatic passoprts. (Local Governors also say that they can only grant facilities if specially authorised.) ' 24. The military and naval administration so far as the public is concerned is looked upon as more efficient and therefore more to be feared than the civil departments. Under the forceful personality of General Mu’ini conscription and enforcement of the Government’s wishes in all matters are carried out ruthlessly, while the Navy, under the equally autocratic control of Colonel Bayandor, lays down the law about navigation on the Karun, and all services nt the port of Khorramshahr, and carries out half-hearted measures against 'smugglers. The discipline and appearance of the army are excellent. The Navy shows signs recently of deterioration. Commandeering of transport and supplies are occasionally reported, but such incidents are not frequent. The incidents of the arrest of Captain Macleod for the alleged offence of forcing his way on board H. I. M. S. “ Palang ” in 1933 to arrange for pilotage under the Basra Port Regulations and the arrest of Mr. Brewster in 1934 for insulting behaviour to a sailor are the only serious instances of interference with a British subject by the Naval Authorities, while the Military Authorities, so far as is known, have a clean sheet. 25. Owing to their refusal to conform to the rules in force in the Shatt-el- Arab there have been several collisions narrowly averted which might have endangered British ships and lives. When the dangers of this or of blocking the channels have been pointed out to Colonel Bayandor his replies have been insolent. So far as Iranian waters are concerned, entire control has been given to Colonel Bayandor who thus exercises civil jurisdiction in many matters which hardly seem to be a Naval concern. No interference by the Police or by the Governor is admitted, as the Navy say that they themselves are outside the jurisdiction of the civil authorities. It is only recently that the Naval Authorities after consant pressure by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company have stored some of their ammunition in a safer place on shore instead of keeping it all in the magazines of the sloops. 26. The Finance Department and the Customs are the most tiresome to the foreign and trading communities. The local _ administration continually appears to be trying to introduce needless complications largely due to their failure to understand instructions from Tehran. _ The Customs authorities at Khorramshahr have always been difficult to deal with and under the administra tion of the last Provincial Director nothing could be achieved without wholesale bribery and onlv then after long delay owing to hopeless congestion. The Customs house at Khorramshahr was partly destroyed m a fire m 1935 and the confusion after that was greater than ever. No proper attempts at salvage were made and Lloyds Agent had grant difficulties put in his way m the execu- tion of his ordinary duties. There was for long a question of closing the Ahwaz Customs and insisting on all goods being deared either at Banda Shahpur where no adequate organisation existed or at Khorramshahr, w there was already congestion. This was finally done m the summ _ ' &gt; but after the fire’it was found necessary to start shipment up t^e Karun for clearance at Ahwaz of most up-country goods, to tl ie f relief ke °^ dis . and forwarding agencies.

Inland telegrams are dealt with promptly, but recently telegrams to Iraq have been sent via Khamqm, so t a one to Basra may take two days. S2 The Railway Administration has been dealt with in the Economic -p ort submitted recentlv. Their dealings with the public are none too friendly, and'much difficulty is caused by the priority given to military requirements. 93 The relations of all these Departments with this Consulate and with British subiects in general have been fairly satisfactory m official matters. Social intercourse as times have gone on has become less and less possible. (52) Lettee eeom H. M.’s Chaege iPAefaiees, Teheau. to the Foeeign Office, London, No. 480|9(36, dated the 21st May 1936.

(54) Despatch fkom His Majesty's Chaege d'Affaiees, Tehban, to the Fobeigx Office, Londox, No. 272, dated the 28th May 1936. I have the honour to enclose herein copies of a despatch from His Majesty’s late Consul at Ahwaz reviewing economic tendencies during the past 3 years in his district. It has been a period of much change, and Mr. Watkins on’s interesting report indicates considerable advance in industry, agriculture and transport and not, it appears, at the cost of abject local poverty. Indeed, according to the Governor of Luristan, the measure of security of communica. tion that has been achieved has enabled several of the more important men in Luristan to amass considerable fortunes. 2. Mr. Watkinson’s despatch also brings out in detail certain features which have already been reported on broad lines such as the extent of Govern ment interference in economic life, the tendency towards centralisation in Tehran, and the great strides made by Japanese mercantile enterprise. The views expressed in this despatch are in many respects borne out by evidence furnished from Bushire to this Legation and notably as regards the legarthy and resignation with which unpopular measures are accepted. 3. I feel bound to make some comment on the reference in paragraph 34 to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. I believe that Mr. Watkinson states the local position correctly and what he writes revives some, echoes here. But there is obviously another side to be considered and I am not ready to endorse the implied criticism that the Company is inactive in support of British trade. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India No. 134. Enclosure to Serial No. (54). Despatch fbom His Majesty’s Consul, Ahwaz, to His Bbitaxxic Majesty’s Chabge d’Affaibes, Tehban, No. 34, dated the 28th Apbil 1936. With reference to your Circular despatch No. 8 (292|2|36) of the 7th March, 1936, I have the honour to submit a short survey of economic tendencies in South-West Iran during the last tjiree years. Local conditions have in some respects undergone considerable changes during that period. At the beginning of 1933, the AngTo-Persian Oil Company’s concession had just been cancelled ; the Khorramabad road had not long been open and was still unsafe ; the railway, built by Americans who were shortly to hand over to the Iranian Administration, was just opened for traffic ; the Port of Bandar Shahpur was marked very faintly on the map ; there was increasing lawlessness throughout the frontier districts and serious agricultural development was out of the question ; neither Italy nor Japan had appeared as serious competitors in the Market ; industrial enterprises other than the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were practically non-existent.2. Since then the Anglo-Iranian Oil Pmrma-nv i has remained the chief economic factor in Khnzistan miderth 50C|UCntly became &gt; giving direct employment to 20 000 nerson^ QT1r i 1C e . tiie new concession labour.

General import is restricted by trade barriers and the Trade Mononnlv Laws, Customs charges have been constantly changing and increasing. The ack of demand for Iranian products abroad has frequentIv caused a shortage of export licences, so that, even when the import quota for certain commodities 91 Khorramshahr was increased, merchants had difficulty in obtaining import pernnts. As a result of the cessation of trade With Russia and in order Chelp the railway, transport by which was made practically compulsory, the import quota for sugar and for textiles via Khorramshahr was increased, and local transit trade benefited at the expense of Bushire and of the Iraq route. The exhaust 1 on of exi stmg quotas at Kermanshah was a further help to the South On the other hand, a reduction of the quota for tea, leather, prints, yearns’ and indigo, m order to encourage local production, caused some confusion in 19d4, and the resumption of trade with Russia that year caused a fall in the pnce of sugar which made it impossible to forward it from Khorramshahr to jye. North without loss. As merchants have at times been unwilling to clear then ^goods from the Customs, there have been great accumulations to which the s-owness and unsatisfactory administration of the Customs have added. ^ 171c ‘ &lt; y tlie signing of a Trade Agreement with Russia and re-opening of Northern. trade routes, the prospects of increased import via Khorramshahr have diminished, as the Russians have not recommenced shipments to the Persian Gulf. As the current budget shows an estimated reduction in revenue from Customs duties, it may be inferred that no increase in the volume of foreign trade is anticipated. 5. In addition to fixing quotas for importation of various commodities, lists of prohibited goods were published from time to time and merchants already in possession of such articles were given one month in which to dispose of them, after which they had to be handed over to Government agents for disposal at a price fixed by Government, Most merchants sold at a loss or concealed their stocks, but goods to the value of Rials 140,000 were handed over and when premises were searched later goods valued at Rials 10,000 were seized. These were all on sale at Government shops opened for thp purpose in Ahwaz and Abadan. The proceeds were handed over to the original owners irregularly and no proper accounts were rendered. After a year had elapsed merchants were informed that they might take back such of their goods as remained unsold against payment of 5 per cent, to cover storage and expenses. There were many complaints of damage, deterioration and loss whilst in the custody of the Authorities. Later, further lists were published and merchants were again forced to hand over stocks of prohibited articles. 6 . Concurrently with the regulation of imports, various regulations have been in force controlling currency. When applying for an import permit, equivalent foreign exchange had to be paid into a Bank. Scarcity of money caused merchants to limit their orders and the divorce of the dollar from gold led to a collapse of markets abroad and consequent shortage of export permits to balance against import permits. Though exchange fluctuations have been .a handicap, exporters did better when rates for foreign money rose. It is96 too early to predict what the result of the recent Exchange Control Law will be. 7. The Government policy aims at the formation into a monopoly of almost every branch of trade and centralisation in the hands of companies wholly or partly controlled in Tehran. During the past three years shops have been licensed for sale of matches. Sugar was formerly a Russian monopoly T but later import was permitted generally against a special licence. Companies were then formed in each town through which sugar was sold locally. For a long time a Government monopoly of import of cotton piece-goods was expected and it was finally put into force in 1935. The principal agents for Japanese shipping companies and exporters at Khorramshahr was appointed local representative of the central organisation at Tehran and he obtained important concessions. The Trade Agreements with Japan and with the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics have provided for supply by those two countries of the greater part of the textile requirements of the Iranian market, and companies have been formed in Tehran and in the provinces for local sale. Various Co-operative Syndicates have been formed for import and export of particular commodities. In spite of all this centralisation, local merchants by participation in the various companies and by acting as transitaries still manage to make some profit, and the Banks report that they handle more business each year. But prosperity depends mostly on the demand from up- country. 8. Government investment in agricultural and industrial enterprises in Khuzistan will be mentioned later in this report. 9. The effect of restrictions and of Government regulations of imports and of currency hae been to make smuggling one of the leading local industries. The very highest officials are said to be involved. The public is thus able to obtain a large part of its requirements of sugar, tea, cotton and silk goods and various prohibited articles at low prices and large profits have been and are being made by merchants in combination with smugglers by land and by sea. This provides employment for many and numerous small merchants only continue to exist through the failure of the Authorities to stop it. Spies have been sent to Basra and to Koweit to obtain information of intended con signments ; the Iranian Navy from time to time captures a dhow with con traband ; a Customs Preventive Department has been organised ; shop and house searches are carried out from time to time. But the Government seems impotent to keep control over such extensive land routes and sea coast and there is no doubt that Customs and other officials and road guards are well compensated for turning a blind eye and bribery secures the release of manv offenders. 10. Similarly there has been extensive smuggling of silver and other currency out of the country, which hats only diminished since silver was with- djuvn from ciiculation. In this also, arrangements with officials have proved all too easy. 11. The effect of these evasions has been to keep down the cost of living a little and certainly to make living conditions for Europeans more endurable. It has doubtless a harmful effect on the economic calculations of the Govern ment, though the fines inflicted from time to time go part way towards making up the revenue defrauded. The most unfortunate effect is the temptation to which sundry officials are subjected, and there are few who do not avail them selves of such a golden opportunity. There is little likelihood of anv diminution of smuggling so long as the present high tariffs and restrictions exist. 12. Taxation, both national and local, weighs heavily on most classes of the population. Tn-come tax and direct charges on imports and exports have increased during the last three years, the former being extended to incomes of Rials 200 per month which affects the great majority of wage earners. The result has been that less cash has been available for trade purposes, those able to do so having kept capital abroad and surplus money invested in landed property which has remained undeveloped. Purchasing power has been greatly reduced and in consequence only the cheapest of articles find a icady sale. Assessments are frequently unfair and tax collectors susceptible to bribery if payment is deferred. The Authorities at one time announced that land devoted to agricultural purposes would not be taxed : later they demanded arrears. The registration tax on motor vehicles was collected butnone of it nor of the road tax levied on imports, was spent on upkeep. Oar owners and transport agencies have found the tax kerosene and certain fuel oils, which replaced the registration equitable. local road on petrol, tax, more 13. Municipal taxes have been imposed on passengers in public taxis and boats, and a road tax on produce brought in to the towns. All of these are swallowed up in the municipal funds which are certainly not all spent on public improvements. The movement of goods or of passengers, however does not seem to have been affected appreciably. An indirect form of taxation has been a series of regulations forcing householders to make pavements or to reface their buildings with brick, or to build to particular specifications invented by the Municipality. The various compulsory changes in male and female attire are also in effect a form of taxation levied on the already over burdened people. The financial aspect of these measures threatened to cause more trouble in this district than any sentimental or religious qualms. 14. Considerable sums of public money have, however, been spent on various building enterprises in Ahwaz, though little in Abadan or in Khorramshahr with the exception of the Naval establishments. Railway buildings, barracks, a new bridge over the River Karun, schools, a Municipal Hospital, and a cotton-spinning factory,—all have been completed within the last two years or are in course of construction. A town planning scheme is being carried out in the bazaar area which up to the present has consisted chiefly in extensive demolition at the expense of the OAvners of the property. 15. The general effect of restrictions, Government control and taxation has been to cause money to be with-held from normal trade. Any idle capital has recently been put into companies and syndicates, more or less under compulsion. Ordinary commerce has only been possible through the credit facilities given by Banks and by the favourable terms quoted, first by the Russians, and latterly by the Japanese. Business demanding much credit had gradually passed out of the hands of small traders. But bankruptcies in this district have been very few and commercial morality remains surprisingly high. The withdrawal of silver coinage and issue of copper at times caused great scarcity of currency. Change for paper notes could at one time only be obtained on payment of a premium. 16. The general cost of living rose steadily from 1932 till 1935, when some alleviation was felt after a reduction in the price of sugar. During the year after the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concession there was general depression caused by unemployment to which the failure of the crops, drought, and stoppage of supplies of grain and necessities from the interior contributed. Refugees from Bushire and other towns also came in search of wbrk. The result was an increase in thefts in towns and general lawlessness amongst the tribes. This improA r ed during the years 1934 anc 1935 as railwav construction and military and naval requirements absorbed surplus labour from the Oil Company. Local produce also became more plentiful and consequently cheaper, though imports continued to rise m pnce. More recently the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company has enlarged its staff to a number greater than ever before and there is no unemployment m this provmee But the high rates of wages prevailing are still off set res . trl T°“Le of taxes on imports, though there is a genera recuc i ' peak wheat barley and dates due to good harvest ! It may be hoped that the peak has now been reached and that the cost of bring will go down as the agricul- tural development of the country advances. 17 Fxnerience of the local Indian shop-keepers and others showed that . . h^pene available for the Quetta Earthquake Relief Fund surprisingly '^y^Jee V^d Local collections for charitable and other Sr arJeet with 18.

IQ The centralising policy of the Government has been reflected in this part of the conntrv by the formation of commercial and industrial syndicates, m which all classes have been persuaded to contribute. Durmg 1933, the Governor-General talked loud and long of companies far commercial and indus- trial purposes unspecified and he secured promises of the co-operation of various local merchants and notables. The Governor of Khorramshahr also tried to organise a Company to import spinning machinery. During the whole of the following vear the Governors continued to call meetings and to exhort merchants to laud together and form companies, to increase then- exports and to erect factories, as they said present methods of business were derogatorv to the State. Little progress was made, though a company was actuallv formed bv twelve merchants at Khorramshahr with the object of ^porting machinery for making flour, ice and soap aud possiWy weaving machinerv. Xoue of this has materialised up to date. In 19 - :i &gt;,‘ ,le Khuzistan Cotton Spinning and Weaving Company was established in \az with a capital of 3 million rials. This was entirely subscribed br local resi dents and the capital has since been increased to 5 million rials, a faetoiy has been erected and is now almost completed. British spinning machinery has been imported with German diesel engines and electrical plant, which it is intended shall also supply current to the town of Ahwar. The Government has no financial holding in tills Company, but it is working in close touch With the Agricultural Department to obtain local supplies of raw material tor the factorv. Companies were also formed in Ahwaz, Khorramshahr and Abadan to deal in sugar and in piece-goods under the central trading monopoly organi sation in Tehran. Part of the capital has been subscribed locally, but much remains to be called up. More recently Companies were launched m Khorramahad and in Buruiird for sale of sugar and of cotton piece-goods. Companies were also formed for electric lighting in Shushter and Behbehan. An endeavour was made to form a syndicate of date exporters at Khorramshahr, half to be financed bv the Government, but merchants were not enthusiastic and refused to co-operate. A small company was also formed for sale of food stuffs in Abadan, which proposes to bring native products from Tehran. 20. In July 1935, it was announced that the ^ Khnzistan Agricultural Companv had been formed with a capital of 3 million rials, almost entirely held by' the Government. This was to import irrigation machinery and electrical plant which would supply the town with light before the Cotton Spinning Companv could get going. A large area was acquired on the banks of the River Kanin. But by the end of the year nothing had been done, and Companv was said to have been dissolved and to ha\ e handed over all its assets to a‘Company known as ' Sherkat-i-Kamn ” formed in Tehran with the same capital. f 21. The only one of these undertakings of any real importance so far is the Cotton Spinning Company, which expects to start production very’ shortly under the supervision of English engineers. The effect of this will presum ably be partially to exclude foreign countries at any rate temporarily from the market as every form of pressure will no doubt be brought to bear to persuade the populace to support home industries at whatever sacrifice, though a complete manufacturing monopoly can hardly be reconciled with existing Trade Agree ments with the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics and with Japan. The Agricultural Company, together with the various irrigation scnemes being carried out under the direction of the Agricultural Department, should require machinery and building material. Increased production of cotton and gram may bring prosperity’ to the district and increase the general purchasing power. The other trading enterprises hardly seem to affect the position of foreign countries in the market. 22. Agriculture, as stated earlier in this report, has made great progress since the tribes have been induced to settle down. At the beginning of the period under review efforts were being made by the Finance Department to distribute wheat for sowing in various districts. But there was little proper supervision and most of it was sold in the bazaars or used as food. Mhen conscription was introduced many tribesmen migrated to Iraq and there wasconsiderable unrest amongst those who remained. As local supplies of grain were insufficient, wheat and barley were brought from Burujird and Kermanshah. As time went on, prospects have improved and the crops have not merely been sufficient for local requirements during the last two years, but there has been a large export of barley from Khorramshahr and some wheat was shipped. The Government has recently decided that cotton cultiva tion must be encouraged rather than other crops. There are two large irriga tion schemes in hand, one in the Dizful district which has always produced cotton, and the other in the Karkheh Valley where grain has hitherto been sown ’ It seems probable that attention will be paid to grain production, as a la ran silo is now being constructed at Ahwaz for the Government wheat pur chasing organisation which is to commence buying here this year at fixed prices, as in other parts of the country. 23! Cotton has so far been the most important crop after grain. Some rice is also grown in the district, but orders have now been given that cotton is to takt its place and that production must be considerably increased for export to the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics m accordance with the Trade Agree ment and for local use in spinning factories. This year cottonseed has been aLirihnted both by the Agricultural Department and by the Cotton Spinning Oommny and boys have been sent to the Agricultural School at Keredj to kam up to-date methods of cultivation and are now in the Dizful district where large areas have been sown with cotton.

If pioper means of transport could be provided a large trade might be done. As it is the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company imports a large quantity of fruit from abroad. 27. A motor-road from Shiraz to Ahwaz has been completed as far as Bahbehan. Survevs were recently carried out in connection with a projected road from Isfahan to Ahwaz. For the present Pars and Isfahan are supplied either by Bushire or by Khorramshahr, Ahwaz and the Khorramabad route. 28. Transport rates were competitive varying with the demand fiom da} to day until recently when the Government fixed flai xates foi loir} tiaffic toi the whole year. But there is no adequate control and higher rates are often charged. Through rates quoted from Khuzistan to the North are very expen sive owing to high railway charges, which are much more than lorn^ hire. It has for some time been expected that a Motor Transport Syndicate would take over all transport concerns, but Government control has not yet gone beyond the fixing of rates and drawing up of various regulations for lorry owners and drivers. 29. The South Iranian Kailway has been under exploitation from Bandar Shahpur to Salehabad since 1932. It is maintained with reasonable efficiency, though the rolling stock and workshop plants are deteriorating rapidly. The track is laid and a regular service kept up for another 50 kilometres North of Salehabad, and work is now in progress on various lots spread over 120 kilo- matters. Apart from the employment of necessary labour and transport of the considerable amount of building material, cement and general stores required, which is all landed at Bandar Shahpur, the construction work carried out under the Kampsax Consortium, does not affect the economic situation in Khuzistan. 30. Bandar Shahpur, in addition to providing a landing place for railway stores, is also the port through which all arms, ammunition and other military supplies are imported. General import trade is very small and it is only three months ago since the first small consignments of produce were shipped to Japan from Bandar Shahpur. The port, except for installation of light-buoys and provision of one or two second-hand motor boats and of a few Customs and Railway warehouses, has hardly been improved at all during the last three years. The organisation of port services leaves much to be desired. A very ambitious plan prepared by Dutch engineers has been considered. Great efforts, however, have been made to persuade traders and shippers that a port really exists there and the number of vessels calling there and tonnage landed have increased every year up to a total for the last Iranian year 'of nearly 100,000 tons, mostly of railway and military supplies.. 31. During 1933 and 1934, Russian vessels and Greek ships or others chartered by the Russians commenced calling at Bandar Shahpur as well as. at Khorramshahr, mostly to land railway lines and sleepers. Italian vessels began calling at both ports in 1934 and a service was maintained about once in two months until econbmic sanctions were applied in November last. Very little cargo was landed at Bandar Shahpur, but Italian imports to Khorramshahr were increasing. The agency is held by the British Agents for the British India Steam Navigation Company. Japanese ships first made their appearance in September 1933. Since then there has been at least one ship per month at Khorramshahr and recently more, while at Bandar Shahpur the Japanese now head the list for quantity of cargo landed, mostly cement for the railway. The agency for one syndicate of Japanese shipping lines, run to the Persian Gulf by the Bombay Conference Lines, is held by the local agents (British) for the British India Steam Navigation Company : the agent for another combine is held at Ahwaz by the representative of the German Hansa Line and at Khorramshahr by the local agents (British) for the Hansa Line. Another shipping agency and general trade agency is held by a Khorramshahi mei chant who also represents the cotton piece-goods monopoly at Khoi iam_shahi and has secured important concessions for Japanese goods. The other important competitor of British Shipping is the Hansa Line which has maintained a fortnightly service to Bandar Shahpur and Khorramshahr since 1934 A large amount of the military stores is brought by these boats, mt the} also land considerable quantities of general merchandise of miscellaneous ^ Butch shipping representatives also visited the Persian Gulf and the bhatt-el-Arab recently with a view to possibilities. v32.

British trade with Iran suffers more from foreign competition than from the direct effect 'of internal economic conditions. Trade agreement with the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics, with Japan and with Germany have flooded the market with cheap articles with which the British exporters cannot compete. There are very few articles in which the quality of British goods is sufficient to off set high prices and the good terms of credit and facilities 'offered by agents for foreign goods. For instance, the superior quality of Manchester piece-goods has always been realised and there has always been a small demand, which has recently increased, but import was at one time restricted by lack of permits which were not required for Russian goods under the Trade Agree ment. Subsequently the whole market was captured by the Japanese with cheap cotton and silk substitutes. The industrialisation of the country and development of up-to-date agricultural methods have provided some opportuni ties for sale of British machinery. Pumps, diesel engines, electrical machinery, railway locomotives and cotton spinning machinery have been supplied for use in this province in the teeth of German, Scandinavian and Central European competition. The Iranian Navy contract which was most unfortunately allowed to go to Italv has had some influence and Italian electrical machinery and bui c mg materials were at one time coming in. Since Italian trade with Iran ceased, part of this has gone to Japan, but there has been an increase m, orders for Manchester and Indian textiles ofbetter quality than the Japauese have hitheito supplied and British exporters have also recently been able to obtain a part ot the supply of hats and European clothing to fit out the new Iran. 34 The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company should exercise a considerable influence in support of British trade, particularly m motor transport Unfortunately the experience has proved the excellence of American lorries and cars, and the increased use of British vehicles by them has not given entire satisfaction The increased ufee n^p of British tank-lorries for distribution and technical “^“'^’^onoTic advice and the drawing up of plans in influence is hmited to gen^econom^ ^ ^ ^ shai wluoh&gt; accompmifed'by ® e ^ainfinancial^consideratioi^,^secured^^c^ye^iopagandTin favour ‘ofBritishTrade or concessions and letTSh tTor’a S h His Britannic of ttie Company’s normal activities.

This should also have its propaganda value. There seems to be no reason why a larger proportion ot British cars and lorries should not be seen in this country. But it cannot be stressed too much that British firms and their agents often drive away customers by quoting stiff and uncompromising terms. 36. The Union of Socialist Soviet Republics having failed to secure permanent cancellation of the AngloTranian Oil Company’s concession, saw the denunciation of its own Trade Agreement in 1933 by which they held a monopoly for the supply of sugar and matches and of 70 per cent, oi piece-goods. Cheap articles for domestic use were also supplied. Their methods were unpopular^ and there were general protests at their failure to carry out conti acts. By Gov ernment instigation merchants were first encouraged and then ordered to stop doing business with the Russian Trade Offices. After negotiations for renewal of the Agreement failed, trade went from bad to worse and the decline ot such influence as the Russians had possessed was steady. By the time that the boycott was called off towards the end of 1934 Japanese competition had become too strong and since then Russian trade has practically ceased to exist. The only import of any importance recently at Khorramshahr has been box-boards, in return for which consignments of wool have been shipped for Russia. This does not affect British trade. 37. Japanese competition has been much more serious and far-reaching. Since 1933 fhe great bulk of the trade in piece-goods passed to Japan, largely owing to their cheapness, but partly to the variety offered. The Trade Agree ment of 1934 guaranteed a considerable exchange of commodities and the market has since then been flooded with every variety of manufactured articles, the cheapness of which appeals to the mass of consumers. A very considerable bulk of the cement supplied during the past year for railway construction and general building has been Japanese. It is offered at a price with which British and European shippers cannot compete. Not only do Japanese ships call regularly at Bandar Shahpur and at Khorramshahr, but nearly every British ship from Bombay or German ship from Port Said brings consignments of Japanese goods. There seems to be little hope of successful British competi tion. » 38. The bulk of German shipments to Iran consist of Military and Govern ment equipment. Much of the cargo arriving on German ships is not of German origin. But the proportion of European to Japanese articles in the bazaars is small. 39. The only British concession in this district is that of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Contracts for the construction of two lots on the Railway, con sisting of, 28 kilometres through the most difficult mountain country, were awarded to two British, or partly British, engineering firms. A Lancashire firm also secured the order for supply and erection of all the spinning machinery and accessories required in the Ahwaz Cotton Spinning Factory. The two British orders for supply of aeroplanes to the Iranian Army only indirectly concern this district. . 40. Contracts and Concessions obtained by foreign interests in this district during the last three years include : Italian equipment for the Naval Workshops at Khorramshahr and various Naval units : the Swedish Danish “ Xampsax ” contract for supervision of construction of the Iranian State Railway, sub contra cts. for which have been given to Italian, Belgian, French, British, German and Iranian Aims on the southern section : a French contract for construction of the Shahpur irrigation dam near Dizful : a Swedish (“ Sentab ”) contract or consti uction of a bridge over the River Karun at Ahwaz and for repair of the bridge at Dizful : and a Dutch contract for extensive port works at Bandar Shahpur, which has not yet been finally approved. German firms secured the order for electrical machinery at the Ahwaz Cotton Spinning Factory and a German engineer from Isfahan supervised the actual building of the factory. 41. The general attitude of the trading community and of the public seems to be one of hstlessness. There are certainly some merchants who must in a burning resentment at the curtailment of opportunities for personal gam which is the inevitable result of the centralising policy of the LnXr'B’ffm thG mer f s i n £ cl ^£es and restrictions cause' constant appre- lension But this is overlaid m most cases bv indolent lethargy accomnanied by constant shrugging of the shoulders. ' ’ accomp *WLetter from His Majesty's THE POLITICAL RESIDENT 30th May 1936. Charge d'affaires, Tehran, to the Hon 'bee ih the Persian Gulf, No. 50Q|2|36, dated the On the 26th May, Motamedy, Head of our Department at the Ministry of 1 oreig'n Affairs, read out to Trott a communication from the Ministry of War to the effect that sailors at Bushire, not employed in official forces, were wearing: clothes which were very similar to. the uniforms of ratings of the Iranian Navy, in particular the crew of the Residency launch wore clothes with a turn-down collar with three white stripes on it and blue cuffs. This was very like the uniform of similar ranks m their Navy. The Ministry of War thought that m order to distinguish between the two, it would be a good thing if the launch crew were to alter some of the detail of their uniform ; in particular to substitute some other colour for blue on their collars and cuffs, and to have one stripe instead of three on their collars. Trott said that he supposed that the launch crew had .worn their clothes long before the Iranian Navy existed Motamedy took the line that this might be so but the launch crew’s uniform was essentially a piivate one, and that it was desirable that it should not be liable to be mistaken for the official naval uniform. He asked therefore that the alterations indicated above should be made in it. 2 , This is an annoying and rather cool request. It is one thing to flatter by imitation, and quite another to ask that the Paris model, after one has copied it, should be changed. But prima facie it seems not altogether un reasonable and my feeling is that it is the kind of request that should be complied with unless it involves great inconvenience. Perhaps you would let me know in due course what you feel about it. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to Rendel and Caroe. (56) Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 152-A., dated the 12th June 1936. Before His Majesty’s Minister leaves England to return to this country, you may desire to be apprised as to the general conduct of the Iranian Government during his absence on matters of interest to the two countries. I have the honour therefore to furnish the following summary : As ybu will be aware, no new political question of any magnitude has so far been raised, nor has any existing one been seriously pursued. The summary therefore is mainly con cerned with the difficulties in Eastern Iran on which Sir Hughe Knatchbull- Hugessen made comprehensive representations orally and in writing to the Ministry 'of Foreign Affairs before leaving Tehran in January. These were set out in two enclosures to Tehran despatch No. 51 of January 27th, and I will deal with them in the sequence then given them. While His Majesty’s Minister made vigorous efforts to obtain redress for the past, he was more optimistic as to securing improvement in the future. His anticipations have, roughly speaking, been justified, but it will be seen that he obtained some success in the more difficult part of his endeavours. 2. As regards the requisitioning of British Indian lorry drivers, the Iranian Government have now promised Rational treatment, and state that they have issued strict instructions as tb the procedure to be followed in future for requisitioning, which must be by the Police and not by the military. There have been no subsequent cases of requisitioning, and the Consular reports have mentioned one or two instances in which it might have been resorted to. On the other hand, and in spite of the promises given by Monsieur Kazemi and Monsieur Soheily to His Majesty’s Minister in January, not a rial of compensa tion has yet been made even in respect of the injured drivers of 1934. I have had three interviews on the subject with Monsieur Soheily, and on June 11th one of nearly an hour with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In these inter views, acting on a semi-official suggestion from the Government of India, I have made clear the possibility of open unpleasantness either in the Indian Legislative Assembly, or in the press, in connection with these lorry drivers and other Persian questions in which Mussulman feeling is interested. The Persian Government have not gone back on their promise that compensation will be paid in respect of the drivers who were killed or mutilated, but there is a104 possibility that the Ministry of War may still try to evade responsibility in respect of the commandeerings. I have sought to leave no doubt m the mni'ls of Messieurs Samiy, Soheily and Motamedy of the deplorable impression that would thereby be created in London as well as in India. 3. As regards the expulsion of British subjects without proper formalities, no answer in writing has vet been received, but there have been no ur her cases, and Monsieur Motamedy on June 10th showed the Oriental Secretary to this Legation, correspondence between the Census Department (by which permis de sejour ’’ are issued) and the Ministry of the Interiors, containing proposals as to procedure in cases of expulsion. These would seem to meet at least two of our three desiderata. A further attempt will be made to secuie the doubtful point, namely that the result of an appeal should be communicated direct by the Ministry of the Interior and not through the Police ; and also to get round Monsieur Motamedy’s present aversion from giving His Majesty’s Legation in writing any reply on the subject of this procedure generally. 4. The situation as regards Indian pilgrims was dealt with in my despatch No. 219 of May 1st. The interruption therein referred to, need not recut. The Shah has a financial interest in encouraging pilgrims and their numbers are in fact diminishing, partly no doubt as a result of the recent prohibition. There is some justification for hoping that in future their treatment inside Iran will shew the promised improvement. 5. For redress was actually secured in the case of Mohamed Ali Habib. The customs officials at Tehran did not disguise their surprise when not only the saris reached them for restoration through His Majesty’s Consul, but practically the full sum of money also. What amounted to hilarity on the part of these officials may be excused as the excitement attending upton a record. 6. As regards the arrests at Meshed after Mr. Mallet’s visit in the autumn, the position is less satisfactory. Unfortunately there seems little, or nothing,, further that we can do. Briefly the position is that the headman of the village of Talkh, by name Ismail, was arrested shortly after Mr. Mallet had camped here and that, according to a message which he managed to send to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed, his arrest was due to a suspicion that he was in British pay. In answer to our representations the Ministry of Foreign Affairs blandly declared that the man was a smuggler, and that the authorities had therefore decided to deport him to his home province of Azabaizan. This step on their part was naturally quite unconnected with Mr. Mallet’s visit. 7. Colonel Daly is now endeavouring to obtain further information about the fate of the headman and his family, but you will appreciate that enquiries are not easy. Unless he is able to furnish me with further details, I do not see that there is any hope of being able to shake the authorities from the present attitude. I would mention, however, that Major Hamber when he passed through Tehran in April, said that he believed that the headman and tv o of his family were still in prison, and that they had originally been denounced by the headman of the neighbouring village, which is the property of the Shah. This man is thought to have had a personal grudge against the unfortunate Ismail and, having failed in an attempt to blackmail him, after Mr. Mallet’s visit, decided to denounce him to the authorities. 8. The Iranian Government have also been, I fear wilfully, obtuse in replv to His Majesty s Minister’s plea that a more friendly attitude should be adopted tovaids His Majesty’s Consular Officers in East Iran. Monsieur Soheily in a letter which referred specifically to Colonel Daly, could only say (u) that the^Governor-General of Khorassan, and the heads of the Municipality and the Police usually 7 ' attended the parties given by His Majesty s Consul-General on official occasions ; (b) that on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee of His late Majesty the Governor-General had accepted Colonel Daly’s invitation to dinner ; (c) that whenever Colonel Daly asked for an interview with the Governor- General, he was granted one ; (d) that His Majesty’s Consul-General was in no way treated differently trom other Consuls. 1 have not pursued the matter further. ft). The procedure Whereby His Majesty’s warships should notify their intention of visiting Iranian ports has now, as you are aware, theoretically at least been settled, and in practice the Ministiy of Foreign Affairs and War Office seem to have transmitted promptly enough to the local authorities the notifica tions from this Legation, but the procedure is not yet ship-shape. In one of the few cases under the new system, the local Governor at Abadan failed altogether to understand his instructions and was obstinate and obstructive and, more seriously, there are indications that the new Iranian regulations may be interpreted ip a narrow and vexacious way on such points as the conveyance of .sick seamen to and from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s Hospital at Abadan. It is to be hoped that the Shah’s expressed desire for good relations between the tw r o Navies will extend to local Governors on the Persian Gulf. 10. Turning to matters subsequent to His Majesty’s Minister’s departure, the law passed in March for the control of foreign exchange has inevitably pro duced a host of inconveniences and difficulties, and its further effects on British trade are not yet clearly discernible. But except in so far as it has enhanced the practical value of the payment clearing agreements which Iran has with some foreign countries, there is no evidence, with one exception which is being reported separately, that the law is being applied in such a way as to discri minate against British traders. It has, however, greatly increased the difficul ties under which Indian, even more than other private, traders are now labouring and indeed, in some cases, sinking. 11. On various minor matters the Iranian Government have been helpful. Notably, they have at long last consented to His Majesty’s Government acquiring the desired site fbr the Consulate at Ahwaz, and during the de-char- during campaign, the Police were responsive and effective in preventing the molestation of British Mussulman women. There has been no revival of the attack on the dissemination of the British official wireless. 12. The outstanding incident of the last few months has been the tragic murder of Mr. Fear, employed by Richard Costain and Company on the Southern portion of the railway. Except that no official regret was expressed to His Majesty’s Legation, it is difficult either to blame the Iranian authorities, or to find serious fault with their measures for dealing with the crime. 13. The above record is, I submit, as a whole not too disappointing. With the single exception of the discourteous omission to warn Indian pilgrims that for two months they would not be allowed to enter Iran—and this omission seems to have been due to the peculiar temperament of the late Foreign Minister there has been no fresh incident ; nor are we here at all conscious of any desire on the part of the Iranian authorities to provoke one. The course of these months therefore has justified the hope of His Majesty’s Minister that his repeated, firm and friendly representations would lead to some improvement as regards the future. 14. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India No. 152. (57) Despatch fro'm the Commercial Secretary to His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, to His Majsty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade, No. (B.)-97, dated the 9th June 1936. With reference to Mr. Gray’s despatch Overseas Trade (B.) No. 76 of May 1st concerning the formation of a transport company at Tehran financed linm official sources, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a note from His Majesty’s Consulate-General for Khorassan regarding the similar tiansport company operating in East Iran. 2 Little has been heard as yet regarding the activities of the Tehran company, but I have been informed that it is proposed to start operations with a fleet of about 100 Soviet trucks (Z. I. S.). Fixed rates would be charged, and LS192FDthe chauffeurs engaged would be required to purchase the trucks on the hire purchase system. If this is indeed the case, little is to be teared from the new company, as the Z. I. S. trucks are understood to. be definitely inferior to American or British trucks of similar capacity. Their sole advantage is prob ably the fact that they can be acquired in the normal process of barter trade without the expenditure of foreign currency, 3.

In continuation of paragraphs 6 and 7 of my despatch No. 160 of the 3rd April last, I have the honour to report that Reza Afshar has been tried in the High Court oi Appeal and has been sentenced to six months imprisonment, to a fine amounting to twice the sum which the court found that he had received as a bribe, and to the deprivation of the right to serve in future as a servant of the Government. 2. The proceedings received remarkable publicity. The vernacular press and the Journal de Teheran filled many columns with detailed reports of the proceedings. Photographs of the public prosecutor making his speech, of the public lea\ing the court, and of the judges in their magnificent new robes were published. The only previous instance of such a detailed report in recent years that I can discover is the trial of Teymourtache. 3. I do not propose to report at any length the very prolix arguments used by the prosecution and the defence. The prosecution's case was, briefly, that Ai shar, when Minister of Roads, and Communications, had demanded from Issa .Kooros, and had eventually received, a bribe of 32,000 rials in respect of certain101 ^eriott, e ispfoi % trafe $ -orders for explosives placed with Kooros. It was alleged that Afshar had coiP fessed his guilt in a petition to the Shah. Another accusation was that the ordei\s had been placed without the previous call for public tender which the law requires. The defence, conducted by Dr. Aghayan and by the accused in person, is difficult to follow from the published record ; the lawyer seems to have confined himself to certain minor points relating- to dates and to variant nnihhloq of little importance. It is interesting to note that what the accused said was more to the point. Although the French text of the Journal de Teheran reported a good deal of the Persian text from the vernacular press, certain omissions were made. The Persian text states that Afshar said that he was induced to ®D,T0I5e ay 19| ^ reliaft, It rims | appear ti 1 Itseei r in ask write his petition to the Shah by one of the examining magistrates, who had not only drafted the petition himself in three different ways, but had himself added certain important words to the petition. The final petition was thus different from what Afshar himself had agreed to and the Court was asked, by the accused, to consider whether it was not a dishonest action on the part of the police de Surete first to suggest a form of petition and then alter it, and to copy it before it reached the Shah. It is interesting that this part of Afshar’s remarks was not considered suitable for the consumption of those who are unable to read Persian. 3. The sentence of six months (part of which has already been served) does not seem severe. Issa Kooros was not called in person. I suppose the main point of the trial was to show how modern and western Iranian justice Bialspn 3,7ol • ' 2,71 550 i i i . 1,81 has suddenly become. I have no further news, however, of the other imprisoned persons. They are presumably still languishing in prison and it is practically impossible to discover any further news of the investigations which are no doubt going on. The fact that a spectacular trial has not yet taken place may perhaps confirm a rumour which I have heard, that the case against Ali Mansur is difficult to substantiate. 4.

Cuttings from “ Le Journal de Teheran ” of the loth, 14th and 16th April are transmitted herewith ; these show his interest in the improvement of local products and also in the well being of e actuaf producers. His Majesty does not appear to have found the progress £ts great ftsi it might have been since he last visited the Exhibition about two years ago. 4. It will be remembered that in the Spring of 1935 a Bill was passed authorising the Government to cede state lands Karun River is receiving increasing attention ; barrages are in course of construction and more are project ed. The demand for pumps is apparently brisk, unfortunately at a time when the difficulties in procuring exchange may handicap British manutacturers. 5. The Agricultural and Industrial Bank affords all possible assistance in the way of advances to farmers and cultivators, sharing of capital, and parti cipation where necessary in various agricultural projects. The Department of Agriculture has been active in forming model farms in different parts of the country* particularly in the Shahriar and Veramine district and in Khuzestam Experiments are being’ made for the cultivation of cotton, flax and sugarcane at Ram Hormuz, Dizftil, Shnshter and Chapour, and of fruit trees in districts other than those actually producing these fruits. Seeds of cotton, beetroot and tobacco are distributed to cultivators on easy terms. The cultivation of cotton is receiving particular attention both for local requirements increasing with the expanding textile industry in Iran, and for export, the bulk of which would appear to be earmarked for the Soviet Union and Germany, Tim cultivation of rice, except In the Northern provinces, is discouraged and cotton is to be grown instead. 6. The production of opium also is being encouraged by loans to cultivators of the poppy. The Kerman crop in 1935 was exceptionally good and it is reported from Shiraz that last yearns crop was large, and that, with the assistance given to growers* the 1936 crop should be a heavy one, given favourable weather conditions, 7. Large quantities of beetroot seed have been imported and distributed free for sowing in suitable districts in order to meet the requirements of the sugar refineries, of which six were functioning in 1935, and two more will be inaugurated towards the end of this year. 7-A. The Department of Agriculture in Khuzestan recently received 150 date palms of first class quality : trial plantings will be made at the model farms at Ahwaz. 8. The production of tea in the Northern provinces during the year ended 21st June 1935 was estimated, perhaps liberally, at 200,000 batmans (a little over 500 tons). Sustained efforts are being made, with the help of Chinese experts and imported drying plant, to increase and improve the output. 9. The cigarette tobacco industry in Gilan and Mazandaran is being fostered by the Tobacco Monopoly, and a cigarette factory with British machinery is to be erected shortly at Tehran, 10. A French expert has been engaged to supervise the silk cocoon industry of Gilan. Production during the year ended 20th March 1936, is reported to have dropped to two million kilos from two and a half million kilos in the previous year. Efforts are to be made to check this retrogression. 11. Wheat, barley and other cereals are under the control of the Societe pour la stabilisation des prix des cereales ; the handling of jute is monopolised for the use of the Jute Mill at Resht ; the export of gum tragacanth, assafoetida and saffron is reserved to monopoly companies, whilst the export of dried fruits will be monopolised by the end of this year. 12. Although a scheme for boring artesian wells in the South would appear to have been shelved, at any rate temporarily, probably on account of the insufficiency of the sum which the Government was prepared to pay, money seems forthcoming for fleets of American tractors which are being distributed all over the country, often without much discrimination in the choice of places to which they are sent. 13. Finally, besides the Agricultural School at Keredj, for which an Austrinn expert has been engager!, two smaller schools have recently been (Allied at Isfahan and Rezaich (Urumia). According to the local press*Provmeml Vice-Governors are expected to take a course at the Keredi School and their appointment may depend on certificates of the Department of Agriculture. r 14-1 am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department Trade (unnumbered). of Overseas ( 61 ) Despatch pbom His Majesty s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, to the Foreigx Office, London, No. 121, dated the 7th March 1936, With reference to your predecessor’s despatch No. 443 (E.-4355|4355|34) of the 22nd August, 1935, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz regarding the adminis tration of the bankrupt estate of Mr. W. N. Sequiera. 2. It will he remembered that the suggestion, put forward in Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen’s despatch No. 280 of the 29th June 1935, that the assets of this estate should now be distributed by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr, was not adopted because it was held that this course would be incompatible with the treaty obligations of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz was accordingly instructed to arrange for the administration of the estate to be handed over to the Iranian Courts. It was realised that this procedure would not be in the interest of the creditors, but account was taken of the fact that they were mainly non-British subjects, and it was considered unwise to adopt in their interests a course which would involve His Majesty’s Vice-Consul in action illegal under international and Iranian law. So far, therefore, as the arguments advanced in paragraphs 3 of Mr. Consul Watkinson’s despatch of the 14th February are concerned, there would not appear to be any grounds for reconsidering the instructions contained in Sir Samuel Hoare’s despatch under reference. 3. In paragraph 2, however, of his despatch, Mr. Watkinson suggests that the course of handing over the estate to the Iranian authorities might involve him or His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr not in illegal action but in most awkward discussions with these authorities. I share to the full Mr. Watkinson’s apprehensions on this point. I fear that it is only too likely that some member of the local judicial administration might seek to make capital out of the opportunity afforded by a case in which a foreign consular authority has undoubtedly erred. It is clearly most undesirable that this should happen, and I venture therefore to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by para graph 7 of Sir Samuel Hoare’s despatch under reference to suggest that further consideration should be given to the matter before action is taken on the instruc tions issued to Mr. Watkinson. 4. I think that the most correct alternative course of action would be to explain the whole story to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and to invite their assistance in finding a solution which would avoid the risk of awkward publicity and of complaints from the creditors. There is much to be said for this course and it is quite possible that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs would be sympa thetic and helpful. On the other hand, past experience shows that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs are by no means always successful in imposing their views or wishes on other Departments, and it is doubtful whether they would in fact be able to prevent publicity if the creditors did raise objections or complain of the conduct of the case by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul. I am therefore reluctant to adopt this course. 5. Mr. Watkinson suggests an alternative procedure, namely that the creditors should be held to be time-barred from receiving any further dividend, since no application for payment has been made since 1921. I do not know whether this course would be legal under English law, but I am informed that it would in fact be correct under Iranian municipal law. An Iranian lawyer to whom the Oriental Secretary to this Legation put the case m outline, withom mentioning the precise facts or names, stated that the point m question would be covered by Article 219 of the Commercial Code, a French translation ol which I have the honour to enclose. It will be seen that under this article the relevant period of prescription is live years. The lawyer consulted appeared to hold that the prescription applies to all bankruptcies, “ the Period of five vears runs from the date of the bankruptcy . the rec ^ duties are finished in five years, and no creditor can claim anything from tha LS192FD110 bankrupt after the expiry of that period. If no creditor applies for any pay ment during five years from the date of bankruptcy, he loses completely the chance of obtaining anv share, and all sums paid m by the debtor and undistri buted at the end of five years revert to the latter. Article oGo, a copy ot which is also enclosed, appears also to show that the period ot prescription is file years, though it is true that this article seems to apply only to the rehabilitation of bankrupts. - - — 6. Thus under Iranian law it would appear that tbe ei editors claims were already time-barred when the jurisdiction of British Consular Courts was abolished. If it would be compatible with English law to take this line there is something to be said for the course, suggested by Mr. atkin.^on, name^ tnat the estate should be distributed to Indian charities. This would probably be the most effective way of burying the case in decent oblivion. At the same time there would seem to be serious objections to this course. It any of the creditors were subsecjiicntly to discover, possibly from the bankinpt himself, that further funds had become available but had never been distributed, it would be difficult to justify the action taken, and His Majesty s ^ ice-Consul might be open to attack both from the bankrupt and from the creditors. It might be possible in that case to recover the sum handed over to the Government of India ; but it seems more likely that the sum could not be recovered, since it would have been distributed and there would probably not be any fund which might be drawn upon to repay it. 7. I am therefore driven reluctantly to the conclusion that the best course is that for which provision is made under Iranian law, namely, to return the balance available to the bankrupt. He may not be deserving, but nevertheless,, if the creditors’ claims are time-barred and the money available does not belong to them, it would seem logical to say that it can only belong to tlm debtor. If the creditors were subsequently to raise objection to this course, I think a logical and even convincing defence might be made. Moreover, this course would not prevent Mr. Sequiera, if he is an honest inan, from distributing the available money liimself among his creditors. 8. I venture therefore to suggest for your consideration that, in the light of the observations contained in the preceding paragraphs and in Mr. Watkinson’s _ despatch, the instructions already issued to Mr. Watkinson should be recon sidered. and that he should now be authorised to arrange for the returns of the sum available to Mr. Sequiera. 9. I am sending a copv of this despatch to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz (Xo. 8). Enclosure I to Serial Xo. (61). Despatch from Hls Majesty’s Consul, Ahwaz, to His Rritaxxic MaVjesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, Xo. 10, dated the 14th February 1936. With reference to your despatch Xo. 36 of September 11, last, regarding the estate in bankruptcy of Mr. W. X. Sequiera, I have the honour to request your further consideration of this case before I take action as instructed. 2. After further discussion with His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr, I am disinclined to hand over the money to the Iranian Govern ment for the following reasons :—(1) I should at once lay myself open to a quer\ as to why it was not handed over before, which I am unable to answer. (2) The Imperial Bank of Iran might be involved as an aecessorv for holding the money so long. (3) Explanations might have to be given by this Consulate or the \ iee-Consulate at Khorramshahr to the local Court as to whv no more vas obtained from Mr. Seqneira. (4) Xo copy exists of the original decision of the Consular Court declaring Mr. Seqneira a bankrupt. (5) The last pavment bv Mr. Sequeira was actually made to _ His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Khonamshahr after he ceased to have jurisdiction in matters of bankruptcy and this fact would have to he communicated to the Iranian authorities if a full statement is to be made. Presumably the whole dossier would have to be tici Atned to them before the Iranian Court could act. (6) The Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr mKht easily be involved in any protests against the whole procedure which creditors chose to make to the Iranian Courts. (7) A long m&gt;.a of diiect correspondence with creditors opens up, if, as is highlv probable, tney fail to secure payment by the Iranian Courts. (8) This failure is almost a joregone conclusion. v2 With regard to ttie first of these alternatives, it is naturally difficult to question the opinion of a Persian lawyer on a point of Persian law. It would at the same time be somewhat surprising to learn that Persian law provides, where sums have been paid by a bankrupt to a trustee m bankruptcy for distri bution among the creditors, either that the bankrupt acquires a right to he return of the inonev if the trustee fails through negligence to distribute it within a period of five vears, or that the creditors lose their rights to any sums available for distribution if they fail to renew their applications for payment each five years. In most systems of law it is the duty of the trustee m bankruptcy to distribute further dividends as and when he receives the funds from which to do so and this duty cannot be avoided by being delayed. In any case, assuming that there is some such provision in Persian law, it must clearly be based on some other article than Article 219 of the Commercial Code, which hardly seems capable of bearing this interpretation, while Article 565 does not seem m &lt;my way relevant. Finally (but subject to what is said in paragraph 4 below), if the Persian law of prescription covers the present case, only a Persian court or some competent Persian authority can say so with authority. His Majesty s Government cannot do so. For these reasons I cannot regard the main ground on which it is proposed to justify the return of the money to Mr. Sequeira as a sound one, and even if the ground were sound, I should still feel some doubt as to whether the return of the money would be fair to the creditors. 3. With regard to the second alternative, I doubt whether the reasons given by Mr. Watkinson in paragraph 2 of his despatch of February 14th, for not handing the money over to the Persian authorities need in themselves be regarded as serious objections. For instance : (1) I am prepared to believe that both the local authorities and the creditors might ask for further explanations. But in that case His Majesty’s Consul or Vice-Consul (or His Majesty’s Repre sentative if the case were taken up through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs) having once expressed regret at the delay which an administrative oversight had caused in the distribution of thfr money could and should decline to enter into any further discus sion as to how the oversight had occurred. (2) As regards the Imperial Bank of Iran, I do not at present see how they could be involved even if the money were lodged in some special account indicating its origin or destination. The responsi bility in such a case is normally the responsibility of the person authorised to operate the account. (3) His Majesty’s Consul or Vice-Consul or His Majesty’s Representa tive could decline to enter into any discussion as to why no greater- sum of money had been obtained from Mr. Sequeira, on the ground that this was a matter which lay within the exclusive competence of the consular court as it existed up to 1929, or at any rate 1928. (4) The absence of any copy, of the original decisions making Mr. Sequeira a bankrupt is certainly unfortunate and its absence might complicate any proceedings by the Persian authorities by rendering necessary some sort of affidavit from His Majesty’s Consul or Vice-Consul. But this difficulty should not *be insuperable. (5) All relevant documents and information would have to be furnished to the Persian authorities, but even though Major Lincoln is still serving in Persia I should not regard the disclosure of this very minor irregularity (if indeed it was an irregularity at all seeing that His Majesty’s Vice-Consul made no attempt to distribute the sum so received) as one which it was necessarv to conceal. (6) If legal proceedings were instituted against His Majesty’s Consul °J Vice-Consul the judgments of the Courts which heard the suit oi Keuben Lalezar against His Majesty’s Consulate at Kermanshah (see Tehran despatch No. 252 of May 30th, 1933), could be cited to show that no such actions could lie. (7) The remedy for excessive correspondence on the part of the creditors would in the circumstances be to leave their letters unanswered. (8) The piospects of misadministration might be somewhat lessened if the case were taken up through the authorities in Tehran.4. But while I do not regard these objections as serious individually, I agree that their cumulative effect is not to be ignored. A further difficulty in the way of asking the Persian Courts to continue the administration of the bankruptcy has, moreover, been brought to my attention. This difficulty is that Mr. Sequeira probably is not, and never has been, a bankrupt under Persian law. The original bankruptcy took place under English law as administered by the British extraterritorial courts in Persia, and although the proceedings of these courts prior to 1928 were no doubt recognised by Persian law, they were probably only recognised in the same way that the proceedings of any foreign court of competent jurisdiction would be recognised. In other words, a Persian court would doubtless have recognised that the bankruptcy was valid under English law and enforceable in Persia within the limits of British extraterritorial jurisdiction but it would probably not have recognised that Mr. Sequeira was a bankrupt in Persia outside those limits. When the British extraterritorial jurisdiction came to an end in 1926'it was provided that the Consular courts should have a period of ope year in which pending cases might be finished and that final judgments given by these courts should be recognised as executory in Persia (paragraph 14 of the Persian note of May 10th, respecting judicial safeguards). But there does not seem to have been any arrangement which could be interpreted as meaning that half-finished bankruptcy proceedings begun under English law could be finished under Persian law. 5. It is therefore doubtful, to say the least, whether the Persian _ courts would have any legal procedure for continuing the administration of Mr. Sequeira’s bankrupt estate, which was begun under a different system of law, were they to be asked to do so. At the same time, I am satisfied that any attempt by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul either to continue the administration himself or to reach a private agreement with the creditors without the assent, of the Persian Government would be contrary to Persian and therefore.to English law, with the consequence that any quittance obtained from a creditor as the result of such an attempt would be invalid and so of no avail as a protection to His Majesty’s Vice-Consul against a claim for the payment of the same dividend a second time. 6. In these circumstances I consider, subject to your views, that the best course will be for you to discuss the matter with the Persian Government on the lines indicated below. 7. You would explain, in whatever manner you think best, that, many years ago a British subject declared himself a bankrupt before a British consular court in Khuzistan and that from time to. time thereafter such, sums as the bankrupt was able to make available for his creditors were distributed by the consular authorities to the persons concerned. A proportion of. the bankrupt s debts, but not the whole, had been paid in this manner when British extraterri torial jurisdiction in Persia finally came to an end and as the bankrupt, who had meanwhile left Persia was not in a position to find any further sums tor his creditors, the administration of the bankruptcy lapsed. Recently, however, it has been discovered that a small sum which was intended for d.istiibution to the creditors lias, owing to an oversight, been lying in His Majesty.s Vice- Consulate at Rhorramshahr since 1929. It is clearly desirable, m fairness lo the creditors, that this sum should be distributed to them even after, this lapse of time, but in order to be studiously correct, you think it right to intorm the Persian Government of the circumstances before His Majesty’s Vice-Consul takes any step which could be regarded as being, though only technically, the continuation of bankruptcy! proceedings instituted when the extiaterritoinu jurisdiction was in force. You therefore hope that the Persian Governmen wi see no objection to His Majesty’s Vice-Consul sending the sums due o wm o such of the creditors as are in Persia. 8. In order to avoid giving the impression that the matter is one which you regard as having any importance or in regard to which you feel any misgivings, you mav prefer at the outset to follow the very general.wording o e piececan^ paragraph, but if the Persian Government ask for details these should.be reaci given. Should the Persian Government then indicate that the distribution should in their opinion be carried out through the Persian courts or other competent authorities you should replv that you have no objection and aie perfectly willing to discuss how this could best be done. 9. In the event of the Persian Government replying (in writing), that they have no objection to the distribution of the money by His Majesty’s Vice-Consu , you may authorise His Majesty’s Consul or Vice-Consul to proceed accordingly. LS192FDIn that case the receipt which each creditor or his representative should be required to sign should be on the following lines : “ Received from His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr the sum of on account of a debt due to me from Mr. W. N. Sequeira, making a total sum of received by me from His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate at Khorramshahr on account of this debt.” No attempt should be made to represent the payment as a final payment or to wind up the administration of the bankruptcy, which should be allowed to lapse. The creditors may if necessary be informed that Mr. Sequeira is unlikely to be able to furnish any further sums, but that in any case^ His Majesty’s Vice- Consulate cannot take any further steps in connexion with the settlement of his debts or enter into any further correspondence, which should, be carried on with Mr. Sequeira direct. xh’ oi OiCKoiori ■ - . r ' ’ ( , ■ ' - ex no: . - 5 t' r ;; e ''' : ( o 7 • e.-:. 3 exit -Q 1 •: t - - l r x / * • * r • \ LS192FD—30—17-8*36—-GIPSi$P the s' Mr,' r yment fed aliki «tv DP 91 (51) f L -.Tn 2018 I A (Received with the India Office Complimentary Slip No. P.

With reference to my despatch No. 300-E. of July 12th [Serial No. (50)] I have the honour to submit the following further comments on the Iranian currency and financial situation based on information received from reliable sources. 2. The National Bank, notwithstanding the recent bolstering up of its situation by the large increase in its capital, is handicapped by a serious shortage both of rials and of foreign exchange. The shortage of rials is more inconvenient than serious; it is due to the fact that, in order to buy at a lower price the new notes which are to be shortly printed, negotiations were allowed to drag on for more than six months, and even now so far as is known the order has not yet been signed. The shortage of foreign exchange is more serious ; it cannot be solved by the printing press, and something tangible will have to be offered against it. It appears likely that the National Bank will not find it easy to produce this counter value. 3. The rial notes new in circulation are to all intents and purposes inconverti ble. S'lver is no longer i sued against them; s Iver coins have in fact practically disappeared from circulation. The Nat onal Bank, as well as other banks perform ing exchange operat on , wi 1 only sell foreign exchange against rials within the limit of the foreign exchange which they can readily obtain on the market. Mean while, the demand for exchange is steadily increasing ; railway contractors’ accounts are mounting up and they need foreign exchange as payment for machinery import ed, or for transfer home as profits, salaries of employees, etcetera. The amounts due for payment to rad way contractors alone during the next twelve months for work already done will be very considerable. Further money will be required to buy rolling stock and equipment (probably about one million pounds), as well as for operating expenses which apparent y have not been foreseen. 4. With such heavy inevitable expenses on hand in connection with railway construction, one might have expected a certain amount of caution, even of parsi mony, in other expenditure, yet I hear that a German firm are negotiating for an order for a dredger, four barges and a motor tug for the Caspian at a cost of more than two hundred thousand pounds, and that a Dutch firm are angling for the supply of a luxury yacht for the Shah. The railway station to be built in Tehran is to cost the equivalent of nearly five hundred thousand pounds, and an expensive and probably unnecessary new “ bourse for Tehran is to be un batiment bien concu et superieur a tons points de vue a ceux deja existants en Iran . o National Bank and the Agricultural Bank are participating to the extent of many millions of rials in the innumerable new companies m process of formation all over the country. 5. A gold reserve of about four million, seven hundred thousand pounds is held at the National Bank, but about three-quarters of that amount was recently transferred to the Bank as part of its capital, and has therefore presumably been completely immobilised. In any case, the export o go ars or u ion P ted, so that he reserve is not at present available for meeting any oemnutments^ MS443FD FQn£:M L&amp;tt*,' vi jf • O t, tiesei . If* r A; S 1 , 0 .im I ; ! t l 92 6. The reserve of foreign currency held abroad by the Iranian Government is at present very low ; it is doubtful if it much exceeds one million pounds. It is believ ed that the amounts to be received as royalties and taxation from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company during the next two years are already earmarked, though not ac tually spent. 7. The possibility that the Iranian Government may in the near future need either a loan or some less patent form of financial assistance must therefore be con sidered, in spite of their known reluctance to recourse to financial assistance from abroad. As the oil royalties would be the most obvious form of security, the report that they are earmarked for two years ahead must be considered in conjunction with the fact that, under Article 25 of the new agreement, the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company could at any time give two years notice of their intention to cease operations, and hence to cease payments. 8.

Enclosed in Mr. Butters’ letter is a copy of a letter from the Minister of Finance summoning the Bank to pay, within one month, the arrears of royalties since 1915 in accordance with the calculations of the Iranian authorities. 2. It seems inevitable that the matter must now be referred to arbitration, which is provided for in Appendix 5 to the Bank’s concession. Mr. Butters ex pressed his satisfaction that the case had at last come to a head, and at the pros pects of arbitration. I asked him if there were any act on which could usefully he taken by me on the Bank’s behalf, but he did not consider any such action was called for at present. I propose, therefore, at present merely to watch develop ments and to keep in touch with Mr. Butters. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the- Department of Overseas Trade No. 0. T. (B). 98.

During the last few years the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly objected to the method of calculation of the annual 6 per cent, royalty payable to the Imperial Government in terms of Article 7 of the concession dated 1889. The said Ministry has been and is of the opinion that the 6 per cent, royalty should have been cal culated on the annual net profit, that is, before deduction of any tax whatever payable n England. But the Bank have not hitherto acted in accordance with the view of the Ministry of Finance, whereas at the outset the Bank adopted this same view and in conformity therewith, during the first twenty-five years the concession was in force, he., from 1891 to 1915, they calculated and paid the royalty on the net profits before deduction of British income tax. It is only since 1916 that the Bank changed the above method and instead of taking as basis the net profits, on which royalty should have been calculated, they deducted therefrom British income-tax and even other taxes. This fact substantiates in the clearest manner the legal argument set forth in this Ministry’s letter of 5th April 1932 and in the note dated 18th June, 1933, to which the Bank replied per their notes dated 8th June 1932 and 28th November 1933. Last year when the matter was brought to my notice I gave instructions that the question be discussed verbally with the Bank with a view to arranging for the settlement of the account. But to my regret the said negotiations have been fruit less and as it is impossible to allow this state of things to continue any longer, I am writing to inform you that the Ministry of Finance require that you will remit to the Treasurer General, within one month, the arrear of royalties due to the Govern ment since 1915, on account of various taxes paid in England and deducted from the net profits annually. You will no doubt admit that in this respect that Ministry of Finance has shown more than usual leniency and it would not be proper to allow the question to remain as it stands any more. In order to obtain assurance as to the method of calculation of royalty during the said period, I request that you will send, within the time-limit referred to above, a statement in the form of the accompanying model in respect of each year from 1916 to 1925. Should the Bank, contrary to my expectation, fa 1 to give effect to this request? the matter will have to be referred to arbitration in terms of Article 10 of the con cession Do you think, however, that it would be becoming for the Bank that we refer to arbitration so apparent a question ?

In Persia renaissance has equally had its hat if not its head and for better or for worse the Pahlevi hat has sheltered the awakening consciousness of those who more often than not forget to call themselves Iranians. But the Pahlevi hat has rested un easily on its wearers’ heads. Neither becoming nor practical it has never been popular. To devout Mohammadans its protruding speak is a positive menace at prayer-time, while on less solemn occasions its impeccable uniformity must have been the cause of acute distraction in gentlemen’s cloak-rooms. I have once or twice made nervous enquiries as to its permanence and have usally been informed that it is a “ hat of transition ”. This definition hap now been justified. Like so many of the world’s glories, the Pahlevi hat has passed away. The good news became known to the general public on the day of the opening of the Majlis, June 6th last. But, if the story which reached my ears is true, certain of the inner circle seem to have been privileged with advance information. An official or junior member of the Government who was present when the decision was taken is said to have stolen from the room and made his way to the largest of the very few local emporia where, in an unconcerned manner, he contrived to purchase almost the entire stock of European hats for five hundred tomans. Shortly after the conclusion of this surprising transaction the manager was in trigued at receiving a similar bid from a second official who strolled into the pre mises. The story ends with the Manager’s realization of the situation and his repurchase of the hats from his first customer at double the price. Even so I understand that demand has far exceeded supply and that the run on felt hats in the Lalezar can be compared to the gold rush of years ago. 2. But a benign ruler has not thought only of the outer covering * he is equally concerned for the intellect within. The impurities of the Iranian language have for some time caused grave concern. There is a regrettable plethora of Arabic words (a sentiment which, for practical reasons, I fully share), there are modern tendencies and expressions which distort the ancient beauty of the language. Doubt has even been expressed as to the desirability of retaining the present Persian lettering. On May 20th the Council of Ministers sanctioned the establish ment of an academy for the Iranian language “ Farhangestan-i-Iran ” which is to be charged not only with the duties of the protection of the language on the mes of the Academic Francaise but is to stimulate scholarship and literary talent. In addition to purifying the language from foreign words and producing a grammar and dictionary this institution is to “ guide thought towards the reality of litera ture and the nature of poetry and prose ” and to “ encourage poets and writers towards the creation of literary masterpieces ”. I am sending a transla tion ot the statute under separate cover in my despatch No. 253 of the 12th June, m case it may interest the School of Oriental Studies. 3 If the uniformity of the Pahlevi hat has disappeared, this is not to be taken as implying complete freedom in all other respects. On June 13th the Shah asked me if I had been present at the opening of the Majlis. When I replied in the afhrmative His Majesty expressed pleasure and remarked that if I had been there some years ago I should have noticed a great difference. Then all were attired in various garbs, there was no cohesion, no corporate feeling. On June 6th last the members were all dressed alike, there was uniformity and discipline : that waswhat a Parliament should be. Of course in England it was different, but what was the use in many countries of a body of men who talked only for the sake of talk ing and with no knowledge of the subject, and he turned to General Hay and said Soldiers are much better, they are simple people and know what they have to do.” I reflected that on a previous occasion when I attended a debate in the Maj lis I had been vividly impressed with the appropriateness of a line from an Ancient and Modem Hymn “ We are not divided, all one body we 4.

(54-A) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 274, DATED THE 26th June 1935. In my despatches Nos. 54 of February 24th and 252 of June 12th (Serial No. 1 in F. No. 489-N/35) I endeavoured to trace a certain progress towards the establish ment of better relations between the Iranian Government and overselves and I gave the former credit for greater reasonableness and for a desire to cooperate in improving the atmosphere. Though entirely satisfactory solutions of one or two minor questions have not been reached, many have been disposed of and subjects of greater importance have also been dealt with. In these matters the Iranian Government have not exhibited that mistrust and obstructiveness which we so frequently experience. I conclude from this that they are at present inspired by a wish to avoid creating difficulties. I have indeed felt it possible to state with some conviction that a perceptible improvement in our mutual relations has taken place. As is shown by his declaration at the opening of the Majlis and by his statement to me at the audience reported in my des patch No. 254 of June 13th (Serial No. 47) it is clear that the Shah shares this conviction. 2. No one, even with my own short experience of this country, would be so rash as to regard this development, satisfactory though it may be , as one that can be reckoned on as durable and I would beg that in anything which I may have to say in the course of this despatch, I may be credited with a full realisation of the uncertainty of things where dealings with Iran are concerned. Nevertheless I should consider it unnecessarily cautious not to look at the situation as it appears at the moment and, having made the abvious allowances, to examine the possi bilities of the future. The moment seems not unfavourable for a wider survey of British policy towards Iran—a task which I have felt it incumbenton me to attempt ever since my arrival but which I have thought it prudent to defer until I had had at least six months experience of the country, a task moreover which is rendered difficult by my consciousness of the diverse and sometimes conflicting points of view with which British policy in Iran is necessarily regarded according as it is viewed in the light of Indian interests, aerial and naval requirements or foreign policy in general. 3. The objects of British policy in Iran have been frequently defined, but per haps they may be briefly re-stated as follows : 1. To maintain our authority in the Gulf and vis-a-vis the Arab Rulers; 2. To safeguard those imperial interests which are affected by Iran’s geographical position between India and Iraq; 3. To hold the balance as against Russian or other penetration; 4. To protect British interests generally and those of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company particularly; while behind these special objects lies the general necessity of maintaining our prestige throughout the Middle East. Until the appearance of Reza Shah, the absence of any cohesion or central control in Persia rendered it necessary to pursue these objects by direct action. In those days little account of national sentiment or of the feelings of the Government in Tehran was required Ihe advent of a strong control and the awakening (or invention) of a lively national MS443FDconsciousness under Reza Shah have rendered those methods impossible. In deed, connected as they are in the Iranian mind with the Anglo-Russian Conven tion of 1907 and the Curzon Agreement, they have tended in recent years to recoil on our own heads. The question which has to be decided now is whether our policy is best .served by a blend of the old tradition with the new methods or by a complete recognition of the change which has been brought about in Iran and of the advantages of paying at least lip-service to the Iranian claim to be treated on an equal footing with other independent and civilised countries. . 4 The problem is not peculiar to Iran. It has presenteditself in various forms both as regards foreign countries and our own dominions—Egypt, I urkey, China India, to look no further into the past. The forms and conditions have varied but the underlying problem has remained the same. So has the policy of His Majesty s Government. The general principles underlying this policy are well illustrated in the statement communicated to the non-Chinese representatives of the Washing ton Treaty Powers at Peking on December 18th, 1926. This document advocates the “ removal of unnecessary limitations on China s Sovereignty , recognises that “ any failure to meet the Nationalist movement with sympathy and under standing would not respond to the real intentions of the Powers; suggests making it clear that “ the Powers in their constructive policy desire to go as far as possible towards meeting the legitimate aspirations of the Chinese nation ”, that it is necessary to “ abandon the idea that the economic and political development of China can only be secured under foreign tutelage , that we should disclaim any intention of forcing foreign control upon an unwilling China ” and that we should “ abandon the policy of ineffective protest over minor matters. and reserve protests for matters where our interests are at stake . Finally it advocates a ‘ sympathetic adjustment of treaty rights to the equitable claims of China . The policy is also well described in a memorandum communicated to the Foreign Office on May 5th, 1927 by Doctor Harold Balme. This memorandum lays stress on the importance of restoring confidence by removing all sources of irritation and suspicion, advocates the surrender of non-reciprocal privilages and rights and calls attention to the need for “ gradually convincing the Chinese people that we are perfectly sincere in our determination to treat them in exactly the same way as we treat other foreigners and to give up such privileges as we no longer enjoy in other countries 5. I quote these passages as clearly defining the general pohcy of which I have spoken and not with any intention of forcing an analogy between China and Persia. I certainly do not suggest that Persia has been treated less sympathetically. On the contrary, the list of concessions and privileges which have been relinquished since the War is a long one, garrisons have been withdrawn from South Persia, British Post Offices have been closed, the Legation and Con sular Escorts have been abolished, capitulatory privileges renounced, the Indo- European Telegraph Department has been dissolved, all contact with the tribes has ceased—to mention only the more conspicuous cases in which our general policy towards awakening national-consciousness has been consistently followed. Only recently the naval bases at Henjam and Basidu have been vacated and the lights and buoys in Iranian territory and waters are soon to be handed over to Iranian management. 6. The question at the present time is whether this policy should be carried to its logical conclusion and whether by gradually removing such few vestiges of the former unequal treatment as still remain, we can hope to lay upon the re sulting friendship and confidence of the new Iran the foundations of a lasting policy which can be relied on to serve the essential aims which I have summarised above. 7. The question can be put conversely. We can ask ourselves whether by clinging to the little that remains of our former hold on Iran we shall not merely provoke that hostility, mistrust and obstructiveness which not only frustrate our policy but afford an opening for the intrigues of third parties which may damage our more important interests. And it may be observed that in the past we have not always reaped the full benefit of our concessions owing to our having failed to make a virtue of necess'ty by a free initiative before being faced with claims which have ultimately proved irresistible. 8. The immediate aim of British policy during the last seven years has been the conclusion of a general treaty to settle once and for all the various outstandingpoints and place our relations on a firm and durable footing It rammt u, • , that tins policy has Mtherto proved unreahzable and, wh“n all account has beet taken of the capnciousness and unreliability of the Iranian temperament I am inclined to think that this failure must for the greater part be attributed to our not having succeeded m convincing the Iranian Government that we are animated by a whole-hearted determination to admit their claim, in their new circumstances to be treated with complete equality. Their sensitiveness and suspiciousness are of course in the highest degree unreasonable but they are characteristic of a nation m this particular stage of development. I have met with instances no less absurd m Latvia and Lithuania. Past experience has shown that nothing but ill-feeling and opposition is produced by provoking these sentiments and the inconclusive result of our negotiations hitherto must in large measure be attri buted to incidents from some cause which has its roots in the former period of inequality. I genuinely feel that as long as there remains an avoidable chance of awakening these sentiments no permanent progress can be made. On the other hand I am far from advocating a policy of general acquiescence in all Iranian de mands. Where those demands are extravagant and where our rights are un impeachable, the utmost firmness is the only salutary course. I feel that in the long run Iran herself would recognise this. 9. The policy then can be defined as one of general sympathy with Iran’s legitimate aspirations, acquiescence in her reasonable claims to final emancipa tion from her former unequal position, coupled with absolute firmness in the face of any extravagant pretensions. This may lead to understanding and coopera tion whereas the opposite course can only mean prolongation of distrust and fric tion and at the best political stalemate. 10. Let me now venture to examine the application of the principle thus defined to the main objects of our policy as summarised in an earlier paragraph. Our position in the Persian Gulf seems naturally to demand prior attention, embodying as it does all aspects of our interests in Iran, aerial, naval, Indian and general. If the situation to-day is compared with that at the end of the war it will be seen that our authority in the Gulf has been shifting steadily and unremit tingly from the Iranian to the Arab side ; our hold on the former has relaxed almost to vanishing point, on the latter it has strengthened and must continue to do so; our stake on the Iranian side may be important potentially, on the Arab side it is actual and vital. The transfer of the air route and of the naval bases sets the seal upon this development. So long as Iran remains united and nationally cons cious there can be no turning back. Owing to the abnormal circumstances in which our former hold on the Iranian side was established it has been impossible to resist this political coast erosion without reversing our declared policy towards national awakening. Nor should we gam anything by resistance the inevitable result would be the perpetuation of that distrust, friction and stalemate which would render our position the more insecure in the Gulf and prejudice our general prestige throughout the Middle East. I am convinced that, so long as a centralised mwer exists in Iran, the old system in the Gulf is impracticable and even dange rous while in its concrete form it is both weakening and undignified. It can carry us no further and will only afford openings for intrigues on the part of our poli tical competitors. 11 I have remarked that our stake on the Iranian side is potentially impor tant This may be an understatement though it is in any case not so great as that' on the Arab side. I feel that in existing circumstances our interests on the Iranian side are best served by recognising Iranian claims and withdrawing what little hold we still maintain before demands are made on us which would expose the weakness of our position. This policy has of course been foUowed almost n 4 - 4 . * 4 . 4 -iL 1 nairal limit. It has been carried lar enougn to proauce actuation in the Gulf which is new and which tends to accentuate itself. In the Lht of this development the Gulf canbe depicted as a triangle the Southern side Wy ry , * Pho Northern side Iranian. The interests of the two, and of Iraq, me'ef at the apex Giv^n halt he old system has gone and that its restoration in meet at the apex, uiven l o,;/nieture of the position &gt;n the Gulf seems present circumstances is mpossible th p ^ ^ ^ now that it is to suggest a Workable policy “ 0 * b the avo idance of provocation and the entirely m Iranian hands, are best y desirable to adopt these methods, cultivation of cooperation, it would appear uesuau nIndeed the converse seems now to be excluded. On the Arab s.de we should pro portionately strengthen our authority and increase our prestige. At the apex, by the establishment of joint Anglo-Iraqi-Iraman control of the waterways vve would achieve cooperation which should go far to secure the future and should also maintain a point of contact by means of which an undec ared influence and check might be exerted upon Iran and an element of unity m Gulf affairs as a whole realised. A short time ago, when the Iraq frontier question was in the hands of an Italian rapporteur at Geneva, this consummation seemed only a remote possibility. But now that there is a chance of a direct understanding on the basis of a Tripartite Conservancy Board it may be held to have returned to the realms of practical politics, The favourable result of the recent negotiations for the transfer to Iran of rights and buoys should encourage this hope. Though not vet finally approved by either Government it provides at least in the immediate future for a degree of cooperation with the British and Iraq Lighting authorities which is certainly deserving of encouragement and which was suggested by the Iramans themselves. 12. By the method of gradual approach and piecemeal solution of outstanding questions, which seems now to have been accepted by both sides in the place of a general treaty negotiated on an a prior* basis, we may aim first at the solution of problems in the Gulf. Acquiescence where our policy is best served thereby and where our locus standi is weak would be accompanied b y firmness m the face of extravagant demands. I feel that the claim to Tamb and Abu Musa should be strenuously resisted, even to the point of risking the destruction of all hope of a final settlement. At that point a decision would be required as to whether admis sion of the Iranian claim or abandonment of a final agreement were the more advantageous—a question of general policy which it is not for me to decide. 13. Once the Gulf questions can be settled other outstanding points could receive consideration. The majority of these concern relations between Iran and the Government of India - problems on the Baluchi frontier, the Iranian obj ec tions to the employment of representatives of the Indian Foreign and Political Department as Consuls, the Duzdap Railway, and on the other side questions connected with the treatment of Indian nationals in this country. As to the first of these, it is to be hoped that the old mistrust has been removed and the old accusations dropped and that the very friendly suggestions of the Government of India will be accepted in the proper spirit, thus making valuable progress. For the time being, at least, the Iranian Government have dropped their unreasoning objection to the employment as Consuls of members of the Foreign and Political Department. It is to be presumed that this is a part of the apparent policy of avoiding creat’ng trouble to which I have already alluded, and it has certainly been given to the Iranian Government to understand very clearly that their only hope of any ultimate concession to their susceptibilities (if such hope exists) rests in their scrupulous avoidance of any initiative in the matter. The question cannot, however, be regarded as disposed of and there is a serious danger that when either of the two “ Consulates-General ” (Bushire and Meshed) fall vacant further trouble will occur which may prove a grave setback to any progress which may in the meanwhile have been made in the direction of general understanding. As regards the Duzdap Railway, the Iranian desiderata are known; the Prime Minis ter reminded me of them as recently as June 19th ; our own attitude has also been defined. It is a question of choosing the proper time for coming to terms and of the use which we can make of this point in negotiations with the Iranian Govern ment. On the Iranian side it can be stated with some satisfaction that the Minis try of Foreign Affairs at least have shown every desire to cooperate in disposing of the grievances of British Indian subjects in this country. 14. By a friendly solution of these problems much could be done towards a closer understanding between the Government of India and the Iranian Govern ment, and I suggest that this in itself is a desirable end. There are so many points of contact and therefore of possible friction, that any improvement in the atmosphere would be of value. Not that the atmosphere is in any way bad at present, it is probably improving, but there still lingers in the Iranian mind the old suspicion that from the Indian side they are viewed from a superior angle as a native race requiring tutelage.on this particular subject in paragraph 11 above. Here it will suffice to say that an understanding on a lasting basis between Iraq and Iran, sealed by an Agree ment embodying as one of its features the Tripartite Conservancy Board, would appear to be as much in British interests as in those of the two neighbours and that anything conducing to friendly relations between Iran and Iraq would seem to be an important factor in British policy. Conversely, absence of a settlement be tween the two parties will probably recoil on our relations with Iran, as we shall be held responsible for failure to induce Baghdad to come to terms. 16. Russia is perhaps not a dangerous rival at present and even if she were, a policy of direct antagonism to her, however carefully concealed, would defeat its own object. The best insurance against dangerous competition from Russia or any other quarter, and also the best guarantee for the protection of British interests, is the establishment of sound relations between ourselves and this country. It may be remarked that Russia need not be the only possible competitor. There have been indications of Italian ambitions, German commercial and cultural pro paganda is active and only a few days ago the Prime Minister spoke to me some what seriously of the ultimate probability of a forward policy by Japan which would affect this country. 17. I have left one important point to the end, being fully conscious of the difficulties which it presents. The Prime Minister has twice since my arrival spoken to me of the Arms Traffic question, once on the occasion of my first visit to His Highness last January and again on June 19th. On both occasions His Highness laid great emphasis on the importance in Iranian eyes of being accorded equal treatment in this as in all other matters. In general I am fully aware that it is the intention of His Majesty’s Government to treat the Iranian Government on terms of absolute equality and this has only recently been confirmed in Sir John Simon’s telegram No. 79 of March 23rd last. The difficulty in this case is that there exists a doubt in our minds as to the manner in which the Iranian navy would carry out their duties in the case of vessels under a foreign, or if full reci procity were accorded, under the British flag. In the light of certain experiences with Arab dhows in the past this is entirely comprehensible. There is also perhaps a feeling that it is unsuitable that vessels flying British or foreign flags should be subjected to the possibility of search by a unit of the Persian navy. The first objection is practical, the second to some extent also sentimental. The first could perhaps be overcome. I see no objection to its being brought tacufudy if per haps unofficially to the notice of the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Aflairs at the TYrrmpr Bmp. The second, however much sympathy it deserves, contains the geim and search. In such circumst principle of co-operation the g regarding the lights and buoys, MS443FDin the Gulf in now small and, in present condition, I shouW have th oug ^ that th possibility of search by a “ 1“t^Cntial to he e^taHishment^f sound rlpfprrpnt In any case I teei tnat it is essenucii relations that tin question should in time be settled. So long as our present attitude is maintained it is impossible to argue that we are anxious to treat Iran fn equal terms as a civilised people and until we ^e^X- ment of our determination to do this it is hopeless to look tor durable good rela tions. . 18 As stated above I have attempted to examine the situation as it appears at the moment”. I have dealt with the Vo sKdS Iran and for this purpose I have had to assume—with one or two sateguardmg clauses that the present regime will continue. But I trust that this assumption V not be mistaken for more than an essential premise to my reasoning. It would be impossible to risk an estimate as to the durabiht} of the Pa i evi regime. It would be equally impossible to-day to venture on recommendations as o e ri.ht policy in the event of its collapse. Three things may occur on the death of the Shah, Lt the succession of the Valiahd, secondly the assumption of power by some rival (presumably military) leader and thirdly disruptiom As regards the first I can only say that the longer Reza Shah lives the better the chances for h,s son though how a young man who by now must have become completely Euro peanized and estranged from contact with his own country can or will step into Reza’s shoes is a quest on which I should be loth to answer. It could at present only be done with the assistance of some loyal, convinced and unselfish supporter who could command the implicit obedience of the army, m fact with the aid of such an altruistic treasure as probably does not exist. r i he best chance for the Valia id in my opinion is that his father should live long enough for him to return to Iran and assume a leading position under the shadow of his alarming father Even so an incalculab e amount would depend upon the character and personality of the heir to the throne. The second possibilities is, historically speaking, perhaps the more likely—but as to the chances of this prophecy is impossible. 1 he third, which in effect would amount to a reversion to type, seems to correspond more with one’s estimate of the national psychology. It might take the form of splitting up into parts of which can only now be called component thanks to the all compelling force at the centre ; it might degenerate into civil strife between rival leaders ; it might take the form of complete exhaustion, a heavy sigh of relief that conscription, railway building, taxation and all-round hustling were ended, or it might take a communist turn. In any case the third alternative which I suggest can be summed up in the word “ chaos ”. We must have all these possibilities in our minds, but as they are at present hypothetical I hasitate to suggest how they should be dealt with. Our former position in Persia, especially in the South, was dictated by the need of counteracting chaos and disruption by what I have called “ direct action ”. If the old conditions returned, our former needs would revive and full justification would be found in our responsibility for our own and possibly other foreign interests. The crisis would probably arise rapidly and would have to be dealt with rapidly. But I still think that we should be better off in the long run with a strongly centralized and friendly Iran and that such support and encouragement as we can give to the present regime is of value to us as a working policy for the present and the wisest insurance for the future. 19. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 121); His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 45), and to the Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf (No. 58). (55) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 304, dated the 12th July 1935. In my despatch No. 255 of the 14th June [Serial No. (54)] I had the honour to report the abolition of the Pahlevi hat. Further developments are rapidly taking place. 2. It is now apparently assumed that a sufficient supply of “ international hats are available and in consequence the police are taking steps to enforce thenew rule that Pahlevi hats must no longer be worn. Their methods of enforce ment vary from a polite reminder to assault and battery upon the unfortunate wearer of what is now an old-fashioned and degrading head-dress. There has evidently been a considerable undercurrent of criticism which has given rise to rumours of rioting in Tabriz and other centres. I understand, however, that all that has happened has been ha f-hearted attempts, rapidly suppressed, to close the bazaar. A few shops in the Tehran bazaar closed out of protest and were promptly reopened by the police. 3. A prominent Divine from Meshed is rumoured to have arrived at Tehran with the object of remonstrating with the Shah on the subject of hats but he has had to take refuge at Shah Abdul Azim where he is closely guarded in order that the populace may not resort to him. 4. In order to popularise the new hats meetings of merchants have been pro moted and a great deal of space in the newspapers is occupied with descriptions of the joy with which this move towards emancipation has been received. So many queries have apparently been received from the province regarding how hats were to be worn and salutations exchanged that a lengthy circular has been issued by the Ministry of the Interior to all Governors on the subject. The circular even goes beyond hats and enjoins cleanliness and shaving as well as the eschewal of eccentric and brilliantly coloured garments and the wearing of black bow ties in the daytime. 5. More serious, however, is the strongly supported rumour that all women under forty will shortly be ordered to discard their veils. There is certainly a strong movement in favour of this prompted presumably by the Shah, although it is not known whether the Queen has yet appeared in public in European clothes. The Prime Minister gave a tea-party at the Iran Club recently for Cabinet Ministers, prominent officials and their wives. The idea was that the ladies should express joy at the prospect of emancipation but apparently they showed great reluctance to do so and the meeting which was intended to inaugurate the new era fell rather flat. The Police are already insisting that women who come for the renewal of their identification papers etcetera shall present themselves unveiled. It is probable that the abolition of the veils will be accepted with the same resignation as other recent nnovations. On the other hand it depends upon the manner m which the Police intend to enforce it; if they start employing forceable methods as they are now doing in regard to hats even the obedient Iranian may begin to snow resentment. 6. The Shah has probably judged his moment carefully and one must assume that he is confident that religious influence is so completely eclipsed that the time has now come to follow the Turkish example. There is nevertheless I believe a ns , albeit a slight one, that he may be forcing the pace too much. 7. I am sending copies of tins despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Gov ernment of India (No. 138); His Majesty s Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 54), the Honourable the Political Resident m the Persian Gulf (No. 63).

M. Kazemi is stated to have been much struck by what he saw, but precisely what that w r as is not revealed. 2. It wus also announced a few days ago in the Soviet newspapers that com mercial treaty negotiations had been resumed at lehran on the basis of the under standing reached during M. Alamfs recent visit to the Soviet Union. This seems to dispose definitely of the statement volunteered by the h irst Secretary of the Iranian Embassy (see Mr. Charles’s despatch No. 229-E of the 4th June) that the question of the commercial treaty had not been discussed during the visit. I fear that enquiries of the Embassy as to the object of M. Kazemi’s visit to Georg a would probab y elicit a no more satisfactory or trustworthy reply. 3. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade and to His Majesty's Representative at Tehran. (58) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 348, DATED THE IOth August 1935. I have the honour to transmit to you a copy of a despatch from the Acting British Consul at Kermanshshah containing an interesting account of local con ditions and describing the growing discontent in that district with the present regime. 2. You will observe that Mr. Gault has been approached by local traders and ulema with an enquiry whether in certain circumstances he would allow them to take bast in His Majesty’s Consulate. Mr. Gault asks for instructions, and I have the honour to enclose a copy of the reply which I am sending him. I should be grat ful if I might be informed by telegram whether you approve the instructions which I have given to Mr. Gault or whether you desire any amendments. c ~ 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Gov ernment of India (No. 163) and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 64). Enclosure (1) to Serial No. (58). Despatch from the Acting British Consul at Kermanshah, to His Majesty’s Minister, Gulhek, No. 83, dated the 2nd August 1935. I have the honour to inform you that in the course of the last week I have re ceived tentative enquiries from some of the traders and ulema of Kermanshah as to whether I would be prepared to allow them to take hast in this Consulate should they wish to do so. While I do not consider it likely at present that these are more than mere words uttered in the hope that they will produce some declaration of policy on the part of this Consulate, in view of the important principles involved in granting or refusing such a request, I should be grateful to receive your instruc tions as to what answer, if any, should be given. 2. It is laid down in Foreign Office circular No. W.-14443/13880/50 of Feb ruary 13th, 1932, that the right to grant asylum is now only based on usage and no longer exists in international law and that, in general, asylum should only be given when the refugee’s life is in danger. While the usage still presumably exists in Iran though no case has arisen for some years, the object, as far as I can ascertain it, of the present enquirers’ seeking to take bast here would not be because of danger to their lives but for the purpose of making a protest against the regime of gov ernment at present existing in this country. In fact, it would be similar to the occasion on which large numbers of Iranians took refuge in the British Legation in Tehran during the constitutional agitations in 1906.3. As far as I know, no case of an Iranian taking refuge in a foreign m'ssion or consulate has arisen since the advent of the Pahlevi regime There misht con sequently be some unwillingness on the qart of the authorities of the country to admit the continued existence of the right to do so the more so as in this case if allowed by me, it might be construed by the Iranian Government as encouragins opposition to the regime. There is also the question of the attitude which would be adopted by the police and military here. Ihe excessive spirit of nationalism vh ch is so much encouraged in iran today coupled with the tendency of the lesser and more ignorant officials to act first and think later might result conceivably m there being some difficulty in restraining these forces. ^ 4. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of the causes g'ving rise to what is today an unusual request I attach hereto a memorandum giving a survey of the existing political and economic situation in Ivermanshah. Sub-enclosure to enclosure (1) to Serial No. (58). Memorandum on the Political and Economic Situation in Kermanshah, July 1933. The most important fact is that while two years ago the Shah was merely disliked by the people here, today he is hated by all. This fact overshadows the whole scene and is a contributory force in most of the factors making for the present feeling of uncertainty and extreme dissatisfaction in the town. 2. This restiveness has been developing for at least two months past and has been much increased by recent events in other parts of Iran. 3. The first unsettling factor to come into play was purely local namely, the sudden drastic action taken by Tehran about six weeks ago to try and check the immense amount of smuggling which was then going on here. This began with the replacement in the middle of June of the Chief of Police which was followed by the arrest of one of the biggest smugglers. This in turn led to the arrest of some fifty local traders on a charge of complicity. The examination of one of these led finally to the recall of the Governor and the implication of the commander of the Kermanshah garrison. It was believed that the Shah himself was taking an interest. Since the town has lived for the past few years on smuggling to a large extent and since the greater part of the population had taken a hand in the game at one time or another everyone became very nervous and what little business was being done came to a standstill. 4. While this excitement was still at its height the decree announcing the introduction of the European hat came out followed almost at once by the expres sion of the official desire that Iranian women should drop the veil. The hold of religion, though it may have been driven underground, is still strong on the people of Kermanshah, possibly because the town lies on the road from Meshed to the holy places of Iraq, and neither of these two measures found approval except perhaps among the young people of the town. The dropping of the veil especially was looked upon with great disfavour by men and women alike. People began to re member Amanullah of Afghanistan. This distress of mind increased as rumours came into the effect that telegraphic appeals had been made from Asarbaqan to a leading alim of Qum, Sheikh Abdul Kerim, for advice whether to wear the infidel hat or not Sheikh Abdul Karim being a Ncrib-i-Imam and his word on religious questions being therefore binding on all Muslims, decline to give a n way or the other in view of the conflict between the Shah and establis ^^ A few days later it was learnt here that the Sheikh had been sent out o f c }, presumably to Iraq. This did not at all reassure loca opinion, an . ^ k was given to discontent on the news of the Meshed disturbances coming out. Kermanshah was the more interested as Sheikh Behlul, who is £ Naib-i-Imam, spent some days in Kermanshah on his “ distobance ago. The latest rumour is that in the course of he f ®°f the shrine itself was damaged. The extent o oca i y 0 ''‘u 0 f ^ pjjoto- judged from the fact that during the last few ays a g . , taken down graphs of the Shah which are obligatory in all shops have been quietly MS443FD5 Finally there is considerable dissatisfaction locally over the question of the price of wheat and bread. About a week ago it was announced that the purchase of wheat in Kermanshah was to be a Government monopoly and that the price was to be rials 120 a Kharvar compared with the open market price of about x als 80 a kharvar. Immediately following this came the forcible closing down of half the bakers’ shops in the town and the raising of the price of bread from 1 rial a man to Rials 1-20 a man. 6. Bread being the main nourishment of the poorer classes of this country any alteration for the worse in price or quality is bound to call forth very consider able resentment against the government or whatever body is responsible for the change. Wheat is plent'ful here this year and yet the Government has raised the price which in turn has raised the price of bread. Not only that but it is currently reported that the Government has no intention by buying all the wheat available. In other words it is merely a device to enable the Shah to sell his Shahabad wheat at an enhanced price. Thus both the landowner and the townsman are angry. The latter has an additional cause for dissatisfaction in that the quality of the bread obtainable now, which is made with wheat bought from the Government, has already deteriorated, in spite of the rise in price. 7. While a part of the information given above is based largely on rumour it matters little now whether the rumour be confirmed or not since public opinion has been unsettled by it and no amount of denials by the Government will make good this damage. It would seem, however, that much more powerful factors than those mentioned would need to come into play before any collective action may be apprehended on the part of the populace, at any rate here in Kermanshah. The spirit of the country has been well broken in the past few years so that much talk will be forthcoming before action is taken. Much will of course depend on the attitude of the army. Here the troops are said to be loyal more out of fear than by desire or conviction and this probably applies to the officers too. Further, the bulk of the Kermanshah garrison is conscripted from the town and province. Against this it is reported that within the last day or so the whole garrison has had to take an oath of fidelity to Reza Shah on the Quran. Such an oath would be binding in all eventualities, unless it had been taken with mental reservations. In any case it will undoubtedly have a deterrent effect both on towns-people and troops. The commanding officer, Sarhang Houshmand is a soldier of fortune having already changed his coat twice-—he began in the Gendarmerie, then went into the South Persia Rifles and then joined Reza’s New Model Army—so if a good opportunity occurred he would probably change it again. 8. To sum up, there is undoubtedly a strong feeling of dissatisfaction with the present regime here and a definite hatred of the Shah. Both of these have been greatly increased during the last month or so by the various factors set forth above. Owing, however, to fear and lack of leadership it would not seem likely that any upheaval need be anticipated, at any rate for the present unless a lead be given from some other part of the country. Enclosure (2) to Serial No. (58). Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Acting British Consul, Kermanshah, No. 20, dated the 10th August 1935. I have received your despatch No. 23 of August 2nd on the subject of bast. 2. As far as can be traced, the last case of an Iranian taking bast in one of His Majesty’s Consulates was at Shiraz in 1924. It is therefore probable that the Iranian Government would, if consulted, maintain that bast was a relic of the bad old days and would absolutely dispute a claim on our part to grant asylum to political refugees. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the practice of grant ing asylum in such cases has in the past been exercised by His Majesty’s Legation and Consulates and recognised by the Iranian Government of the day. This country must therefore be held to fall under the category envisaged in Foreign Office Circular despatch (W.-14443/13880/50) of February 13th, 1932, as a “ country where the usage of asylum exists”.3. It follows that paragraph 5 of the Foreign Office circular should h* applied “ 0 Xg actual dataTr to r i^ See Th ma ? ge r t ! 1 eIlter &amp; Consu,ate with Object of avoiding actual danger to life Ihis clearly does not mean that a party of demons- trators of the type mentioned in your despatch should be allowed fc/take bast in &amp;s Majesty s Consulate with the object of stating a political protest. Still less doel it suggest that individuals or parties should be allowed in to assure ther^ selves of this means of safety in case of subsequent need. To agree to such a request wou.d, as you suggest, come very near aiding and abetting disturbances against an existing regime^ It is true that the famous bast in the Legation in 1909 pTrtook °i this character, but I should not wish to claim this as a precedent in discussions with the Iranian Government. In interpreting paragraph 5 of Foreign Office circular o Fe ruary 13th, 1932, the scope of local usage ” should be held to cover only requests tor asylum provided that actual danger exists to the life of the peti tioner. It is not always easy to decide how far such danger really exists aud it would seem that a decision could only he taken on the merits and circumstances of each individual case, giving perhaps the benefit of the doubt to the petitioner in cases where the presence of danger appears likely without being absolutely proven. The readiness or not of the authorities to give the fullest guarantee for the refugee’s safety will probably be the best subsequent test. 4. Nevertheless, if you receive further tentative enquir es from citizens of Kermanshah, it is desirable to give them to understand that you will not allow them to take bast with you. In general there must exist no ground for any accusation on the part of the Iranian Government that we are encouraging people to take bast, or undertaking to grant it in advance or in hypothetical circumstances. If, in spite of all discouragement, individuals manage to introduce themselves into His Majesty’s Consulate with this object, you may assume that local usage will permit you to grant them asylum provided that actual danger to their lives can be said to exist. Any such case should at once be reported to me by telegram. 5. I am forwarding a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Office (No. 348) with a request that they will inform me by telegraph whether they approve these instructions or whether they desire any amendment in them. Copies are also being sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad. Despatch from (59) His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 337, DATED THE 1ST AUGUST 1935. With reference to Chancery letter to the Eastern Department of January 21st last, I have the honour to report that, according to a statement issued to the press, the Iranian Government have decided to establish the following new dip lomatic and consular posts :— (а) A Legation wid be opened at Bucharest, thn M'nister be ng accredited to° the Bomanian, Bulgarian, Greek, Yugoslav and Albanian Governments ; (б) a Legation will be opened at Buenos Ayres ; and (c) new Consulates will be created at New York and Jerusalem and a Vice- Consulate at Damascus. 2 It is further announced that the Iranian Legation in Saudi Arabia will henceforth be attached to the Iranian Legation at Cairo and that an Information Bureau will be established in Par s, which will issue a fortnightly review in French on political and economic developments in Iran. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Gov ernment of India (No. 155), and to His Majesty s Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 59). (60) Despatch pbom His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreion Office, London, No 293-E, dated the 10th July 193o.106 returned to the letter from the Minister of Finance summoning the Bank to pay- certain arrears of royalty claimed by the Iranian Government. This has been communicated to me confidentially by the Tehran Manager of the Bank. 2. Two new points of interest are now raised by the Bank. In the first place while maintaining as hitherto that they were only called upon to pay royalties on net profits after deduction of British income tax, they threaten that if the dispute goes to arbitration, they will at the same time revive their unsettled cla m of nearly six million rials (£75,000) for the losses caused by the looting of certain of then- branches during the war by Persian troops. They are prepared, however, to waive this claim if the Iranian Government withdraw their demand for the payment of further royalties. 3. In the second place the Bank refer to the repeated demands by the Ministry of Finance that they should pay income-tax in tins country. While maintainino- that the terms of their concession exempt them from the payment of such tax, the Bank nevertheless offer to pay it in future on their net profits derived solely from their business in Iran on two conditions :— (a) that the National Bank henceforth confine their functions to those of a Bank of Issue and that the Imperial Bank of Pers a are re-appointed the Commercial and Exchange Bank of the country, entrusted as before with the Government’s exchange business ; and (b) that an amicable agreement is reached in the question of royalties. \\ hile it is understood that the Bank has not for some years made a net profit in this country, presumably it would at once begin to do so if it obtained the above requirements. The Bank finally suggest that before there is any resort to arbit ration, and endeavour should be made to reach a friendly settlement of the various points in dispute. 4. I consider that the Iranian Government will in aT probability refuse to admit that there is any connexion between their demand for the payment of past royalties and the claim advanced by the Bank in respect of the looting of their branches. The latter may, however, find their claim of some use as a bargaining (Gunter. The second proposal advanced by the Bank is of considerable interest though it may seem to savour of optimism. If the Iranian Government were ever to agree to it, however, it might save them not merely a lot of worry but perhaps also a considerable sum of money. Persistent rumours are in circnlatinn «« in No. 0. T. (B) 144. ( 61 ) [E 3866 3441/34.] Despatch from Imperial Bank of Persia, London, to Foreign Office, London, June 19 th 1935. Bank royalties.Recently, However the Minister of Finance has become insistent upon a settlement being reached and on the 11 th ultimo wrote to the chief manager demanding, within one month, payment of the so-called arrears of taxes. At the same time the Minister asked to be supplied with a statement showing the amount ol the taxes under discussion. ° I am forwarding, for your information, a translation of the Minister’s letter 1 also a copy of the chairman’s reply of the 12th June to His Excellency, together with a copy of the statement 1 prepared and certified by the Bank’s auditors setting forth the net profits of the bank, and other details, from the inception of the bank of 1931, when royalty became no longer payable. Here the position remains until we receive a reply from the Minister. There is another matter I should like to mention, namely, that, having been granted a supplement to our charter authorising the change in the bank’s name to “ The Imperial Bank of Iran,” we are placing special resolutions before share holders of the bank at an extraordinary general meeting to be held on the 28th instant, following our annual general meeting. I enclose a copy of our letter to shareholders dealing with this change 1 . Enclosure. Mr. Barnes to Minister of Finance (Tehran.). June 12th, 1935. Mr. Butters, our chief manager, has forwarded to the board of directors a translation of your letter to him of the 11th May last, which has received their careful attention. We deeply regret that there should be any disagreement between the Iranian Government and the Imperial Bank, which has served the country for some forty-six, years, and has endeavoured to implement its concession not only in the latter but in the spirit in which it conceives it to have been granted. The board adhere to the view stated in their notes of the 8th June, 1932, and the 28th November, 1933, in which it will be remembered they were supported by high legal authority that the interpretation “ net profits ” in article 7 means that which remained after all expenses taxes and other charges, in whatsover country incurred, had been deducted from gross profits. Although it holds a concession from the Government of Iran, the bank is an English company established by a British Royal Charter of Incorporation, and the net profits referred to in article 7 of the concession dated 1899 can only be arrived at after deduction of British income tax. As requested in your Excellency’s letter I am forwarding you, without prejudice to the bank’s contention, a statement, prepared and certified by the bank’s auditors, setting forth the net profits of the bank, royalty paid and taxes paid, not only for the years 1916 to 1925 but from the inception of the bank until 1931, when royalty no longer became payable. The statement shows the royalty paid and the royalty that would have been payable if the view of the Finance Minister were upheld. It will be seen from this statement that the Minister of Finance is mistaken in supposing that up to 191*5 royalty was calculated and paid on the net profits before deduction of British income tax. In most of the years from 1891 to 1916 on y the minimum royalty of £4,000 was payable, but there were a few years m whic i there would have been a slight excess payble, namely, 6 per cent, on £26,474 it the contention of the Ministry of Finance had been adopted. After 1916 the profits of the bank were greatly increased by the exigencies of the war and the full royalty on these profits after deduction of Brtish income tax, has been paid to the Iranian Government. But, as this is a point to which the attention of the Ministry of Finance is specially called, a P or lon 0 these exceptional profits, instead of being distributed to the shareholders, were, in accordance with sound financial practice, placed to reserve un s. e funds and the annual additions to them are invested in Britsh Government s«ur ties, the interest of which is paid to the bank net, after de uc ion o ment tax. MS443FD 1 Not printed.jamsm I I il ; I iit 1 , : || I li : 10^ The board bold that, even if the Finance Minister’s method of calculating royalty were adopted as regards the trading profits of the bank, it cannot be extended to the gross income of the invested funds which the bank has only received after deduction of tax. There is, however, another matter which would have to be considered in any arbitration, and that is the unsettled claim of the bank on the Government of Iran for the losses occasioned by the looting of certain of their branches during the war by Iranian armed forces. Full particulars of these losses have been submitted to the Govenment of Iran in former years, and the total amounts to 5,952,027 rials. In order, however, to arrive at a friendly settlement, the board would agree to withdraw this claim if the Government of Iran, on their part, withdraw their present demand and give the bank a complete discharge for past royalties. There is a point not mentioned in your Excellency s letter which may he alluded to here so as to arrive at a complete settlement of all matters in dispute between the Government of Iran and the bank. This is the repeated request made by the Ministry of Finance that the bank should agree to pay income tax in Iran. It is hardly necessary to remind your Excellency of article 5 of the Bank’s concession, which lays down that “ the bank, its establishments and branches, shall be wholly exempt from every kind of taxes and imposts, ” and it would be impossible for the bank to agree to pay income tax in Iran on profits made in England and Iraq in addition to British income tax. But as regards net profits derived purely in Iran, as certified by our auditors, the board would not be un willing to pay the iran income tax, provided they were given a satisfactory quid pro quo. Reasonable compensation for such a departure from the terms of the concession would be not only the friendly settlement of the royalty question as indicated above, but also, as suggested by General Amir Khosrowi, the confine ment of the National Bank to the functions of a Bank of Issue only and the reap pointment of the Imperial Bank as the commercial and exchange bank of the country, entrusted, as before with the Government’s exchange business. It is gathered, however, from the final sentence in your Excellency’s letter you would prefer that an endeavour first be made to settle the matter by agreement rather than by resort to arbitration. In this the board concur, and to this end they suggest that the various points in dispute be brought before representatives of the Government and the bank with a view to a settlement being arrived at. ( 62 ) Endorsement from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 309, dated the 13th June 1935. H i s Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Prin cipal Secretary of State of Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit herewith, copies of the documents mentioned in the subjoined Schedule, on the subject of tours by the Acting British Consul at Kermanshah. Enclosure I to Serial No. (62). Despatch from His Majesty’s Consul, Kermanshah to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 18, dated the 4th July 1935. I have the hoour to inform you that on June 23rd and 24th last, in company with the Military Attache Major Pybus, I carried out a tour through the Pushtd- Kuh district, going along the road from Shahabad (formerly Harunabad) to Eilam (formerly Deh Bala, also known as Husseinabad or Husseinieh) and thence to the Iraq frontier at Mansurabad along the recently opened road from Eilam to that place. 2. A detailed report on the road from Shahabad to Eilam was submitted by Mr. Consul Summerhayes in his despatch No. 64 of December 21st, 1934, For the new road from Eilam to Mansurabad I append a route report for the details of which I am indebted to the kindness of Major Pybus. 3. As regards the section from Shahabad to Eilam the only important changes since Mr. Summerhayes’ journey would appear to be the compietion of two villages of stone houses for the tribes, one alongside the road in the middle of the Guawurplam about 23 miles from Shababad and one near the point where the road enters the Aiwan plain about mile 35. (See also Kermanshah diary for May 19 35 graph 51.) Few people were seen on the road except in the Aiwan plain where h * rv “ mE -»p”*”- o- s 4. At Eilam most of the population had moved into tents on the surroundina plain and so the town was comparatively deserted. A large new school bu 2 has recenty been completed and there is vague evidence of an attempt at towS planning. ^ ^ uuwii cn i 5 1 T0 ^ ^ rom to Mansurabad was even more deserted than that from bnanabad to Eilam and. on arrival at Mansnrabad we were told that it had been opened only a fortnight earlier and that we were the fourth party to come through. In this connection it is of interest to note that in an official Iranian route book the Mansurabad road has nominally been in existence for over a year One party of the Ali Begi tribe was met on the move to its summer quarters but few other people and no cars. Between Eilam and Mansurabad there are three or four road guard posts but on the whole the population was decidedly thin. 6. At Mansurabad, which is not marked on any map but is approximately five miles East by South of Zorbatiyeh, there are stationed a detachment of road guards in charge of a captain, and a Frontier Commissar and Governor combined in the person of an army lieutenant colonel. Since there is no accommodation at all in Mansurabad for travellers we were obliged to accept his hospitality for our night’s lodging- Up till a year or two ago Mansurabad was apparently a mere collection of mud huts hardly worthy of a name at all. Then rough quarters were erected for the Frontier Commissar and the detachment of road guards. Now a brick built governorate is being put up as well as a quarantine station, and, though traffic across the frontier seems small, a customs post. The main post in the district is at present at Kaleh Safid a few miles North East of Mansurabad but will be transferred to the latter place in due course. Supplies are scanty, many commodities having to be obtained from Kermanshah, while the water, though plentiful, is bitter and drinking water has to be brought from an underground channel seven miles away. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad, Enclosure II to Serial No. 62. Despatch prom His Majesty’s Consul, Kermanshah, to His Majesty’s Minis ter, Tehran, No. 19, dated the 4th July 1935. I have the honour to inform you that on June 25th, last, in company with the Military Attache, Major Pybus, I carried out a tour along the road from Kermanshah to Nausud. 2. I append a route report on the road for the details of which I am indebted to the kindness of Major Pybus. 3. Completed about two years ago, this road was constructed large'.y to facili tate the control of the turbulent Kurdish tribes who live in these parts and who even today are by no means entirely broken. There is thus little traffic on the road except of a military nature, though there is a somewhat nebulous plan on foot to connect up with a road from Suleimanieh, to be built by the Iraq authorities. 4. At present the area west of the Palangan Pass is still under military adminis tration although it is understood that the civil power, in the shape of road guaids and police is gradually replacing the military. 5. From the summit of the Palangan Pass almost to Nausud there is a chain of blockhouses of stone placed on each of the six or seven larger summits between these two points. Except for the first post on the summit of the Palangan Pass, which was manned by soldiers, they are held by detachments of six or eight road guards. Between the Palangan Pass and Qishlaq, which is a we 1 wooded stretch and therefore difficult to control, there were, m addition smaller stone towers about three quarters of a mile apart containing four or six icgu ar so lers anbetween these sentries in pairs every few hundred yards. All wheeled traffic must stop at the post on the summit of the Palagan Pass and notffieation be sent to Qishlaq by telephone before it can proceed. Traffic rs stopped for the mght two hours before sunset. The delay imposed upon us here by the time taken by the military to decide whether to let us through or not was responsible for our being unable to cover the entire road as far as Nausud. The headquarter of this district are at Qishlaq where there are two companies o. infantry apparen y e o gmg o the 22nd, regiment. 6. At Paweh there are also troops probably in similar numbers and also the road guard headquarters. It seems, too, that irregular troqps are use y e Iranian authorities in this neighbourhood inasmuch as one individual was seen m Paweh clad in Kurdish clothes and wearing several bandoliers full of military ammunition which he would not have been able to do excep wu e approva of the authorities. 7 To Nausud itself we were unable to penetrate for the reason given above and so little information can be given about it. A Frontier Commissar is stationed there and, doubtless, troops as well. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty s Ambassador at Baghdad. (63) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London No. 363-E., dated the 22nd August 1935. In continuation of my despatch No. 248-E. of June 12th, I have the honour to transmit herewith a list, which has been prepared by the Commercial Secretarj, of new companies recently established or in course of formation in Iran, or of increase in capital of companies already in existence. It will be observed that, in respect of those companies whose capital is stated, these developments over a period of less than two months require the raising of hew capital to the tune of two hundred and sixty-nine million rials, or about three million pounds, a considera ble share of which will have to be furnished by the Agricultural and Industrial Bank. There is a definite tendency, it will be seen, to give exclusive rights in res pect of certain commodities to particular firms, and some of these exclusive rights appear at the moment to be likely to overlap. 2. With regard to the company formed for the control of grain prices (vide my despatch No. 312-E. of July 20th), it was stated in the “ Setareh-ye-Djehane ” of August 18th that, as the prices fixed for grain in the various centres vary, holders of stocks of grain will be prohibited from transferring their stocks from one town to another. Unauthorised despatch of wheat from, say, Kasvin to Tehran, will thus presumably amount to smuggling and will be punished accordingly. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade [No. 0. T.

A notice published in the Journal de Teheran of August 23rd states that the various Commissions which have been studying the text of the Treaty and of its annexes have practically finished their work, and that the Council of Ministers met yesterday to examine the Treaty. 2. It seems probable that the Treaty will again provide for a balanced trade between the two countries taking the form of a huge barter transaction w ith no foreign exchange changing hands. It is possible, however, that the Soviet trading establishments will no longer be allowed to deal freely with individual merchants, but will do their buying and selling either directly with the Government or with the various monopolistic enterprises now being set up with the active encouragement of the Iranian Government, usually with financial participation by one or other of the Iranian State banking concerns. 3. The “ Setareh-ye-Djehane ” of August 14th announced that the Soviet Commercial institutions had recently concluded with the Iran Trading Corporation an important transaction comprising the sale of piece-goods, cement, sugar, and Iron valued at two hundred million rials (about two million two hundred and twenty thousand pounds sterling) against raw cotton, rice, skins, wool and dried fruits for a like amount. The quotas reserved to the Soviet Union for the economic year June 22nd, 1935 to June 21st, 1936 have not yet been published. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (O.T.B.-193); the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India No. 172 ; and His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 69). (65) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 375, dated the 23rd August 1935. With reference to correspondence ending with Sir Stephen Gaselle’s semi official letter to Mr. Loxley, No. L.-928/51/405 of the 26th March, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, copies of two circular memoranda from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs regarding the use of titles and other methods of address. 2. In a circular issued by the Prime Minister which has appeared in the press, and of which the first enclosure to this despatch is an extract, it is explained that the use of long and inappropriate methods of address, titles and compliments, is inconsistent with the requirements of the age, which are that time should be devoted to effective action and work, instead of being wasted on the use and display of unnecessary words and expressions. 3. The Head of the Protocol Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has confirmed that the effect of the circular is to abolish the title “ His Highness ” and also all such titles as “ Mirza ”, “ Khan ”, “ Beg ”, “ Amir ” and “ Seyyed ”. The Prime Minister, hitherto His Highness Mirza Mohammad Ali Khan Feroughi, iherefore becomes His Excellency Monsieur M.A. Feroughi. The Minister for Foreign Affairs becomes His Excellency Monsieur B. Kazemi, and the Under secretary His Excellency Monsieur A. Soheily. The Iranian Minister in London becomes Monsieur Hussein Ala, and the Head of the Protocol Department Monsieur Abbas Ferouhar. 4. In addition to titles, the Prime Minister’s circular also abolishes all the elaborately formal methods of address both for individuals and for cities and Government departments, etcetera, which Iranians have hitherto delighted to use.113 ^ 1S 1 S f 1 ! 1 t ^ a f instructions have been issued that any letters hearing such addresses should be returned to the sender. 5. lam sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary ot the Govern- ment of Xndia (No. 190), to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 75), and to the Acting Political Besident in the Persian Gulf (No. 82).

Various causes combine to make it difficult to form an accurate appreciation of the internal situation in Iran. The press is completely muzzled, so much so that nobody has, for instance, any idea how many casualties occurred m the Meshed disturbances ; Iranian officials, who are almost the only Iranians we are allowed to meet are invariably discreet in discussing affairs and usually confine themselves to praising the present regime and their great Kmg ; consular reports from the provinces indicate the same difficulty in obtaining a true picture of public feeling. 1 am therefore compelled to form my views from such odd scraps of news as can be picked up by travellers, by members of the Legation on tour, and from private individuals most of whom, not being officials, are apt in their more indiscreet moments to show a good deal of animus against the otlicial parvenus who are now the country. running 2. One thing is certain ; poverty is more wide spread and severe than at any time within living memory, with the exception of the famine year during the war. A Hamadan land-owner recently told a member of my staff that his peasants were worn to the bone ; they used to have in their houses a rug and an oil lamp and would always offer him a cup of tea, but now none of these little luxuries can be afforded and the peasants live within four bare earthen walls ; the women in this village were almost naked and the landlord's wife had to distribute forty garments to them. The Acting British Consul at Kermanshah has recently reported on the dissatisfaction caused there by the Government fixing the price of wheat and there by raising the price of bread. The effect is expected to help farmers in the Kerman shah district, of whom his Imperial Majesty is the most important, but it will be a blow to Hamadan agriculturists who formerly got a better price of their crops than that now fixed by the Government. Bread prices have, indeed, been fixed all over the country, and it will be illegal to move wheat from one town to another. That this poverty is not confined to western Iran is proved by the gloomy report of a member of the staff of the Imperial Bank of Iran who has recently returned from a long tour. 3. In general I am inclined to think that the situation has considerably deterio rated since Mr. Mallet wrote his memorandum enclosed in my desptach No. 5 ol January 9th last. The degeneration can be summarised under three headings, financial, economic, and political. 4. Financially the country is beginning to feel the effects of the extravagant expenditure on armaments and public works. All reports from the provinces show that T ehran is more and more absorbing wdiatever trade exists ; merchants in other towns are moving to Tehran, unless they have already succumbed to bankruptcy, and beggars, who swarm in provincial centres in spite of a police interdict, seem much less numerous here. There is indeed no reason for unemployment w en roads, factories, museums, jockey clubs are being erected in frantic haste to embe is the capital and its approaches, not to mention the numerous workmen required or the Railway. These workmen do not, however, get paid more than three and a ha Rials a day even when they have to work many leagues away from their homes* They are often conscripted and of those thus forcibly enlisted last year in oneHamadan village for work on the railway in Mazanderan twenty-six died. No wonder that the villagers look upon a man taken for such work as already dead. The railway is now a recognised drain on the financial resources of the country and even the almost total deprivation of the poor man’s little luxuries of tea and sugar will not suffice to pay for it, but what can one say of the project to build a Stock Exchange in Tehran which is to be the “ most splendid building of the capital ”, so splendid indeed that the twelve plans hitherto submitted by architects of various nationalities have not been deemed sufficiently magnificent. The Shah’s famous Chalus Road to the Caspian, a more golden road than was ever that to Samarkand, has now been proved to be useless for about five months in the year owing to the blocking of the highest pass by snowdrifts and the lower slopes by landslides ; a Belgian firm has therefore been given a contract to bore a tunnel through two kilometres of the mountain top, a labour of two years and incalculable cost. Mean while Iran has gone off the silver standard and the rial is falling rapidly on the exchange market. Unless a stabilisation fund can be created soon I understand that there may be a serious collapse of the rial, all the consequences of which cannot be foreseen. It is held by many people that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s royalties provide such excellent security that the Iranian Government has only to overcome its prejudice against a foreign loan in order to live in opulence for many years to come. This is a subject to on which I do not feel competent to pro nounce, but it is greatly material to the future of this country, and I should be much interested if you could furnish me with an expert opinion on this point. 5. Economically the country is not recovering from the slump. Exports are not increasing and the merchants are no better off. The casual reader of the Tehran press might imagine from the almost daily accounts of the formation of new companies that a boom is in progress, but actually the Government are providing almost all the capital for these enterprises and the merchants are thus being kept occupied in what virtually amounts to a managerial capacity. The other pro vinces are being starved for the benefit of Tehran and the Shah’s “ private provinces in the north, and the farmers have suffered so severely that the Govern ment has at last been forced to act in order to help them, but even then, as related in paragraph 2 above, the Government’s efforts are likely to do as much harm as good. Only the royal estates in the north are prospering owing to the Lavish expenditure on roads, bridges, hotels, experimental farms, etcetera, which are paid for from public funds, but the profits from which go to the Shah’s pocket. 6. Both the above factors are bound to react upon the political situation. Here we must, I fear, note a distinct deterioration. The introduction of European hats is not as popular as the press, by its frequent and almost frenzied zeal for them, would have us believe. A friend told a member of my staff that the bazaar quarter of Tehran is seething with discontent and latent fanaticism, which fortunately is unlikely to come to the surface “ unless trouble arises in some other way ” (1 think he was referring to the Shah’s death). We know what happened at Meshed. Those ghastly events have, owing to press censorship, become magnified all over the country, and in Iraq, so that the casualties in dead alone are now commonly believed to have been about two thousand. The peasants, among whom there is still a strong religious superstition, are said to be murmuring a good deal. 1 he Shah has suffered an almost mortal blow from the sacrilege at Meshed ; it may riot have effect upon him but it may well be a nail m the coffin of his dynasty That the Shah is alarmed is proved by the temporary dropping of the idea of forcibly un veiling women. The Military Attache was recently at Ardebil and found the population being kept under by a daily parade round the town of a battalion of troops; here the grievance was the removal to the new Tehmn museum of the famous treasures of the shrine which have since the days of Sli ah Abbas drawn thousands of prilgrims annually to the shrine and thereby earned the inhabitants of Ardebil a regular livelihood. No inkling of the disturbed situation there has reached the press, although it was openly admitted to Major Pybus by the local Commandant of Police, as also by his opposite number in Astara. 7. The disturbing feature of this deterioration of the internal situation is that it tends to make still more uncertain the position on the demise of the bhah. 1 do not mean that His Imperial Majesty is likely to die yet; on the contrary he seems to be in excellent health at present. As long as he lives the country will probably MS443FDremain quiet, but he is getting intensely unpopular again and his Turkish triumphs are now wearing thin. People still try to put the blame for their misfortunes on the incompetence of his advisers, but they are also asking why he does not “ sack the lot” One or two Iranians have recently remarked to members of the Legation that they fear the ultimate conversion to Bolshevism of the working class when once religion has been eliminated from their system. The Shah’s death is quite likely to be the signal for such a movement; the fear of his heavy hand will have gone and the search for a new leader may be difficult. At present Hitler seems to provide the inspiration, but the Iranians are of a very different kidney from the Prussians and Nationalism, even if blended with the semblance of democracy which abolishes the title of Khan and Mirza, cannot for ever remain a popular creed. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Govern ment of India (No. 173), to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 70), and to the Acting Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf (No. 78). ( 68 ) Endorsement from His Majesty’s Consul-General, Meshed, No. 331, dated the 22nd August 1935. Two copies of despatch No. 115, dated the 22nd August, addressed to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. Enclosure to Serial No. 68. Despatch from British Consulate General for Khorassan, Meshed, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 115, dated the 22nd August 1935. I have the honour to report a new departure in the manner in which Income Tax is to be collected by the Iranian authorities. 2. Last year persons considered liable to the tax were arbitrarily called upon to pay a sum fixed by the local Income Tax Commission which included a few traders in each locality but which was virtually controlled by the official members. When objections were raised and it was demanded that in accordance with the Law the books of the traders concerned (which are sealed by the Revenue Depart ment and supposed to be the record on which Income Tax would be based) should be examined, this request was invariabley refused. After much wrangling and discontent the sums originally demanded were, in most cases, reduced, and paid by those concerned. 3. I am now informed that for the current year it has been determined that the Income Tax to be collected from Khorassan is six hundred thousand Tomans (1 Toman equals 10 Rials) of which 375,000 Tomans is to be raised in Meshed and the balance in the districts. 4. The Revenue Department have accordingly allocated the total sum to be paid by “ professions ” and propose to appoint four leading members of each profession who will assess the amount to be paid by individuals of their professions. 5. It seems obvious that the amounts so assessed will bear little or no relation to Income and it is perhaps a foregone conclusion that foreigners will be assessed out of all proportion to their incomes. 6. A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department under Endorse ment number 331. (69) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 393, dated the 7th September 1935. With reference to my despatch No. 337 of August 1st last, and to my letter to Mr. Rendel of August 17th, I have the honour to inform you that the following diplomatic appointments have now been officially announced:— (a) Monseur Mohammad Ali Mogadam, at present Iranian Minister at Jeddah, to be Minister at Bucharest;(b) Monseur Mohammad Shayesteh, who is at present serving in London to be Minister at Warsaw ; (c) Monseur Nader Arasteh, the Iranian Minister at Warsaw, to be Minister at Buenos Aires ; (d) Monseur Fazlullah Nabil, director of the Pars new agency, to be director of the newly-formed Iranian Information Bureau at Paris ; and (e) Monseur Abdullah Entezam to be director of the Pars agency in Tehran. 2. Monseur Entezam, who has served in recent years as Secretary to the Iranian Legations at Warsaw and Paris and who was also for a spell at Geneva, has recently been seconded to study the organisation of news agencies in a number of different countries and has only returned to Tehran within the last few days. He is a pleasant young man with an American wife and talks good English. He used to give the impression of being rather a buffoon, but he bears a high reputation for ability in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and his recent training in Europe may finable him to do something to raise the standard of output of the Pars Agency. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Govern ment of India (No. 190), and to His Majesty’s Representatives at Warsaw, Buenos Aires, Bucharest and Paris (No. 100-M.).

With reference to your Overseas Trade despatch No. 76 (25905/33) of 15th August last I have the honour to inform you that the metric system was intro duced on 21st March 1935 in virtue of the law passed on 8th January 1933, which was reported in Mr. Lingeman’s despatch (B) No. 28 of 11th February 1933. 2. Steps are now being taken by the Government to enforce the use of the new weights and measures and official inspections will be made at shops to ensure the adoption of the new system. 3. A booklet and pamphlets (in Iranian) of directions have been issued free to shopkeepers and the public to assist them in coping with the new system. 4. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India under No. C.-7, and the Commercial Secretary, British Embassy at Baghdad, under No. C.-27, of to-day. (71) (Received with Political Secretary's letter No. 35, dated the 29th August 1935.) Despatch from Foreign Office, London, to the Secretary to the Office of Works, London, No. K. 8053/329/234, dated the 15th August 1935. With reference to correspondence ending with Office of Works letter D. C. 8/ 28351 of the 24th September 1934, I am directed by Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare to transmit herewith, to be laid before the First Commissioner of Works and Public Buildings, a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran regarding the reported desire of the Persian Government to buy the consular property at Hamadan. . . „ 2 It is still impossible to say that the property will not again be required lor consular purposes, and unless a substantial sum were offered for it, it would appear inadvisable to sell; while, if the premises were leased to the Persian Government, it might well prove impossible to regain possession m case oi need. 3 The Secretary of State does not view with favour the su^estion that public' funds should be committed in any way in conne^on with the u S e of the consular house as a public rest-house, and is of opinion that His Majesty s Treasury would not concur in this proposal. „ ^ n 4. Sir Samuel Hoare would welcome the observations of Mr. Ofl^y-Gore on His Majesty’s Minister’s despatch and would be gratefu118 informed of the minimum sum which His Majesty’s Office of Works would he prepared to accept for the property. Enclosure to Serial No. (71). Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 277, DATED THE 26th June 1935. I have the honour to inform you that the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs recently enquired of me whether His Majesty’s Government were prepared to sell the Consulate property at Hamadan. I understand that the Iranian Government desire to purchase it as a residence for the Governor. 2. Provided that the Iranian Government are prepared to pay a reasonable price for the property, I do not see that we have any alternative but to dispose of it. It is at the moment unused for more than half the year except for four months in the summer when His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz and His Majesty’s Vice- Consul at Mohammerah go there on recess, and for the quarterly visits paid by His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah. Furthermore, apart from the cost of repairs, a certain annual outlay is entailed on the wages of a property agent who is paid Dials three thousands nine hundred (forty-eight pounds) per annum, a care-taker- gardener who gets Dials two thousands five hundred and twenty (thirty-one pounds), and under-gardener who is employed during the summer only at a cost of Dials five hundred and sixty (seven pounds); total approximately eighty-six pounds yearly. 3. On the other hand, for reasons which I shall develop below, I am strongly averse to sacrificing the property at any price. It cost thirteen thousand pounds and in 1932, when there was question of leasing it and one or two offers were made to purchase, the best of the latter was for Dials two hundred and ten thousand (two thousand, six hundred and twenty-five pounds). This offer was refused and, while I do not know how much the Iranian Government are prepared to pay to-day, it seems to me unlikely that they would offer a sum which His Majesty’s Government would consider reasonable in view of their initial outlay on the property. 4. Moreover, apart from financial considerations there are, in my opinion, many reasons why it would be a pity to dispose of the property. It is true, as I have said, that it is at the moment little used; but I have for some while been considering whether it might not be possible to take greater advantage of it than has been done during the past few years and, having now had the opportunity of obtaining the views of His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah who, as you are aware, is at present filling the post of Oreintal Secretary at His Majesty’s Legation, and of Mr. Keif, the Depresentative of the Office of Works who inspected the property on his way up here in April, I have reached the conclusion that, with the expenditure of relatively little more money, it would be possible to open the house permanently as a rest-house for members of the Legation and other Government servants. 5. The number of potential visitors is considerable. The courier regularly spends a night at Hamadan, both on his upward and on his downward journey, and during the spring, summer and autumn there is a steady stream of travellers passing through, including members of the staff of His Majesty’s Legation, His Majesty’s Consuls, official visitors from Baghdad and other guests coming to stay in the Legation. A calculation has been made which shows that during the past three months approximately forty persons have spent the night at His Majesty’s Consulate at Kermanshah, and this does not include any of the couriers who pass straight through. Many of these persons would also have spent a night at a Con sulate rest-house at Hamadan. Kermanshah is approximately three hundred and seventy miles from here and, while some people cover the distance in one day, many prefer to break the journey at Hamadan, and more would do so were they not faced with the rather cheerless prospect of a night at the Hotel Alvand (formerly “ de France ”). 6. There is already a certain amount of furniture in the house and it would be possible to supply most of the further needs of the place by bringing furniture and other household effects from His Majesty’s Consulate-General at Isfahan.We are hoping to dispose of the latter property at an early date it would be an inexpensive matter to remove such things as would be required and send them to Hamadan. Very little, if any, furniture would need to be purchased, though it would be necessary to equip the house with mattresses, blankets and linen, crockery cutlery and kitchen utensils, etcetera. 7. Another essential would be to engage a whole-time indoor servant. The present gardener-caretaker does his work satisfactorily, but he has neither the time nor the training to undertake housework. It would, of course, be necessary to engage a most reliable man, since he would not be under regular supervision, and his wages would come to not less than thirty pounds per annum. As against this a regular charge could be made of all persons spending the night at the Consulate (other than of His Majesty’s Consular Officers from Kermanshah, Ahwaz and Mohammerah), and it might thus be possible to recover most, if no t all, of the additional expenditure. One proviso must, however, be added. The utility of a rest-house at Hamadan depends very largely on whether or not it is well run. I have no doubt that the number of potential visitors is sufficient to justify the experiment; but unless it is equipped to a reasonable standard of comfort, many travellers will nevertheless prefer to go to the hotel. In Isfahan, Government servants regularly stay at the Consulate-General because it is more comfortable than the hotel; the same can easily be made to apply at Hamadan, but it will be necessary to spend sufficient money at the outset and to engage a sufficiently good servant to make it attractive. 8. There is one further consideration. So far as can be foreseen, no circum stances are likely to arise in the measurably near future which will make it desirable to re-open a Consular post at Hamadan, but the house is such a good one and experience (for example, at Ahwaz) has shown how difficult it is to acquire suiatable property in this country, that it would seem a mistake to dispose of even a pro perty that was little used unless a really good price could be obtanied therefor. 9. I would accordingly suggest that I be informed in due course of the nrnimum sum in sterling which His Majesty’s Office of Works would be prepared to accept for the property; and that if the sum offered by the Iranian Government proves to fall short of this minimum, I be authorised to submit figures showing the approximate cost of equipment and upkeep of the Consulate as a rest- house, together with an estimate of the return that might be expected to accrue from payments by travellers. I fully realise that no final decision can be taken as to the use of the property as a rest-house until such figures have been prepared and considered ; but I have thought it well to refrain from entering into a mass of detail pending further developments in regard to a possible sale and pending a decisions as to whether a proposal to create a rest-house at Hamadan would be sympathetically entertained in the event of no sale materialising. 10. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Acting British Consul at Kermanshah (No. 16). (72) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 395-E., dated the 7th September 1935. With reference to your despatch No. 415 (E. 4691/191/34) of August 8th concerning the request of the National Bank of Iran or over ra , London, I have the honour to report that it is remoured here that Nation Bank have recently consigned for export fifty kharvars (one kharvar equate 664 lbs.) of silver, the value of which would be about sixty thousand P° u .“ ds ster . It is presumed that this measure has been taken in or er o r ®. le y , measure the acute shortage of foreign exchange, but further shipments will have to be made if the situation is to be restored to normal. After a pen^l of ^ome duetuations in exchange rates, the rial last week was air y y , p | to the £., and during tfie last few days, as a result of sehing by the National Bank, the rate has further fallen to eighty-seven Rials dinars titty. MS443FD2 It has a'so been remoured that, no doubt as a resu t of shortage of foreign exchange a'l important orders for Government account will be made m terms of llTak and on a compensation basis. Similar remours have crculated previously but the situation is obviously worse at present, and colour is lent to the story by the fact that a call for tenders for railway material recently issued and reported by e Commercial Secretary in h s despatch No. Overseas Trade B) 185 of August at! has now been amended in the sense that quotations must also be made in rials. If this policy is generally adopted it w 11 be practically impossible for British firms t o tender for sudi orders in future, as the fluctuations of exchange would add too large an element of risk and the compensation obligation would be most d fficult for indiv dual firms not estab ished in Iran. 3. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade No. 0. T.

(73) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 283, DATED THE 1ST JULY 1935. With reference to my despatch No. 181 of the 20th April and my Savingram No 5 of the 26th of that month relative to the punishment of certain Deputies and journalists, I have the honour to inform you that the ejection of Mirza Hussein Khan Dadgar, the last president of the Majl s, who is still in disgrace and supposed to be abroad, was invalidated by special vote. His successor as pres dent is Mirza Hassan Khan Esfandiari, Haji Mohtesham-es-Saltaneh, the subject of personality report No. 15 of this year. The Afghan Ambassador is convinced that Dadgar never managed to leave the country and is now in Kasr-i-Qajar, though his son was allowed to go into exile. 2. Of the two journalist Deputies Mirza Ali Khan Dashti and Mirza Zam-al- Abidin Khan Kahnema, whose arrest was reported, the former is understood to be ill in hospital and the latter to have been sent out of the country to Iraq, his birthplace. Dashti’s paper, the Shafagh-i-SurJch, is still suppressed, but a con cession for the Iran, Rahnema’s old paper, has now been given to Mriza Majid Khan Movagher, who already controls two small local papers. 3. Movagher, the son of a former Deputy for Khuzistan, has not been prominent so far, and after this recent lesson his and other papers are less likely than ever to venture on any criticism of the management of this country. In the Majlis too there has been no sign of sympathy with the disgraced Deputies. 4. It has been suggested that the release of the two journalists may have been thought politic n view of the recent visit of a special correspondent of the Italian paper Stampa, of whom some fuss was made here. (74) Despatdch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to hoREiGN Office, London, No. 280, dated the 29th June 1935. I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a despatch from His Majes y’s Consul at Ahwaz, regarding the distribution of the assets of a bankrupt British subject, Mr. W. N. Sequiera. 2. It would appear that under the Notice issued under Article 2 (1) of the Persia Order in Council 1928, there would be no objection under English Law to the continuation of consular urisdiction in this case, and that His Majesty’s Vice- Consul at Mohammerah is therefore entitled under English law to distribute the assets of the bankrupt in question. On the other hand the Order in Council can hardly be binding on the Iranian Government, and they would therefore appear to have grounds for a possible objection that the case should have been wound up during the year of grace allowed by paragraph 14 of Monsieur Pakrevan’s note of the 10th May 1928. From a strictly legal point of view it therefore seems doubtful whether consular jur'sdiction can be cla med in this case.3. There can, however, be no doubt that in the interests of the creditors them selves t is in every way preferable that the distributiori of the assets should be done by Captain Chauncy. If they were handed over to the Iranian authorities endless delays would result, and the greater part of the sum available would be swallowed up in court fees. It will be observed that by far the largest creditor is the Italian Consul. If he and the other leading creditors agree to the distribution of the assets by Captain Chauncy, it is unlikely that objection will be raised by the remainder. It would probably be advisable for Captain Chauncy to sound them informally in advance, but I do not consider that any formal assurance that they accept the distribution by Captain Chauncy should be sought from them, since such a request would make it obvious that our jurisdiction was regarded as doubt ful and might prejudice our position if any dispute shou d arise which would bring the case to the notice of the Iranian authorities. 4. I would therefore propose that Captain Chauncy should be instructed to sound the leading creditors and if he finds that they have no objection, proceed to the distribution of the assets as proposed by Mr. Consul Watkinson. 5. I have the honour to enquire whether you concur in these instructions. 6. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz No. 21. Enclosure to Serial No. (74). Despatch from His Majesty’s Consul, Ahwaz, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 52, dated the 10th June 1935. 1 have the honour to request instructions regarding the disposal of the estate in bankruptcy of Mr. W. N. Sequiera, at one time head-clerk at the British Consulate at Mohammerah and at present resident in Baghdad. Mr. Sequiera declared himself a bankrupt in 1914 before His Majesty’s Consul for Arabistan at Mohammerah. His assets were collected and deposited m the Consulate tor eventual distribution to the various creditors whose claims amounted to Rs. 15,340. In accordance with arrangements made with His Majesty s Consul various payments were made by Mr. Sequiera, the last being on June 6th, 1929, when the sum of Rials 600 was remitted from Baghdad after pressure had beei brought to bear on Mr. Sequiera through the High Commissioner. Two dividends had been paid out in the meanwhile by the Consulate as from Augus , ’ , March 22 1931, amounting to 3 annas and 1 anna 6 pies in the rupee r.-specti y. The sum of Rs 1,877 nine annas and Rials 2606-25 remains m hand to-day equivalent to a total of Rs. 2,326, which would enable a final divident to be paid amounting to a little over 25 per cent, of the balance still due to 2 Can tain Chauncy has been in correspondence recently with Mr. Sequiera and is satisfied that he Is not in a position at present ““tCeTms The qL mil4 it Up in order for the Vice-Consulate to accept them, and tnere seems u pssss s rs * j p~p- «»i p*y— powers now to deal with cases of this nature “htn ® dad 0 f instructions as to obiect.

Despatch from Foreign Office, London, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 443, DATED THE 22nd August 1935. I have given careful consideration to the suggestions contained in your des- ™r’ 2 /?° ° f 29tl1 June re § ar(iin g ttie distribution of certain assets of the estate ot Mr. W. M. Sequiera among his creditors in Khuzistan and elsewhere, but have reached the conclusion that it is undesirable for His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Mahommerah to undertake the distribution of these assets, at any rate without the consent of the Persian authorities. 2. The legal position appears to be, as you surmise in your despatch, that although a British consular officer can be regarded as having jurisdiction under English law to act in his judicial capacity in such a matter as the administration of the bankrupt estate m Persia of a British subject, the exercise of this jurisdic tion would today be incompatible with the treaty position existing between His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government. Article 2 (1) of the Persia Order-m-Council of 1928 states that jurisdiction shall continue in respect of any matter pending before the said courts the Consular Courts) upon 10th May 1928. It is true that the notice of 11th May issued under the Order-in-Council goes on to add the words “ and falling within His Majesty’s civil jurisdiction exercisable in Persia ”, and it might be argued that the present case does not fall within any such jurisdiction because His Majesty no longer has any civil jurisdic tion exercisable in Persia. It could also be argued, however, and probably correct ly, that these words denoted the civil jurisdiction exercisable in Persia at the time when the notice was issued. There can be no doubt that at that time His Majesty’s Government still had jurisdiction (in pending cases) and that the present case fell within that jurisdiction. Consequently it is possible to take the view that under the notice the jurisdiction of the consular courts is to continue in respect of it, and the notice does not state any time limit within which such jurisdiction is to be completed. But it is important to note that the notice only confers this jurisdic tion on the Consular courts ; it says that “ the jurisdiction of the courts established under the “ Orders-in-Council mentioned in the Schedule to the said Persia Order- in-Council, 1928, shall continue, etc.” Hence, if jurisdiction is to be exercised, the Consular officer must exercise it as a court in his judicial capacity. It would not be possible to bring a mere private arrangement within the scope of the notice. Since it is only by virtue of the notice that the bankrupt could receive a valid dis charge under English law as a result of any proceedings taken by the British authorities in Persia, it is essential that the matter, if proceeded with at all, should Be settled up by the Vice-Consul acting as a court. 3. On the other hand the date (10th May, 1929) beyond which His Majesty’s Government undertook by treaty not to exercise jurisdiction through their consu lar courts in Persia has long since expired. It consequently follows that if the Consul were in fact to form himself into a Court for the purpose of administrering Mr. Sequiera’s estate, the mere fact of his exercising jurisdiction in this manner would be contrary to international as well as Persian law, while any acts performed thereunder (such as the distribution of the assets and the discharge, either partial or final, of Mr. Sequiera) would be invalid under Persian law. 4. I agree that from the practical point of view the distribution of the remain ing assets by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul under a private arrangement with the creditors would have many advantages, especially for the creditors. The draw backs to such a procedure are that unless the Vice-Consul were to act as a Court, his actions (such as a purported discharge of Mr. Sequiera) would not, for the reasons explained above, be valid even under English law, still less under Persian law (though this might not matter much to Mr. Sequiera, seeing that he lives at Baghdad), and that he might even be held accountable either by Mr. Sequiera or by some dissatisfied creditor for the money which he had disbursed. If on the other hand the Vice-Consul were in fact to act as a court the fact might very well come to the notice of the Persian authorities, for even if the “ Court ” were to be formed in the privacy of his office and without the attendance of outsiders, the documents issued in his judicial capacity might easily pass from the hands of one of the creditors into the hands of some Persian official, particularly if the documents needed to be stamped or registered. If that were to happen the Persian Government would have very valid grounds for complaint. MS443FDIf ; • I I f 1:1 : I j ii ll : L i ) 124 5. In these circumstances I am of the opmion that the correct course to pursue in this case is for His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz or His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Mohammerah to hand the sum held on behalf of Mr. Sequiera’s creditors against a receipt to the local Persian authorities, with a list of the creditors and of the shares in the estate to which they are severally entitled and to ask the authorities to arrange that the appropriate courts in Khuzistan shall, as the legal successor of the former Consular Court, undertake the distribution of this sum to the creditors and either give Mr. Sequiera a final discharge or continue to administer the bankruptcy in so far as any further administration is necessary or possible. Mr. Sequiera and the creditors should be informed that this has been done and that any further enquiries on the subject of the bankruptcy should be addressed to the Persian authorities. 6. Were there more substantial sums owing to British subjects I might he inclined to consider whether the risk of a private arrangement might not be faced. But it appears that the leading creditors are foreigners and among the British creditors only the two sowars of the 27th Light Cavalry and possibly the son of Mr. D’Costa would be likely to regard the prospective dividend as a sum of import ance. 7. Subject to your further observations I shall be glad if you will instruct His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz in the sense of paragraph 5 above. (74-A) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Gulhak, to Foreign Office, London, No. Overseas Trade (B.) 212, dated the 14th September 1935. I have the honour to report that, according to the “ Journal de Teheran ” of September 6th, the Council of Ministers has decided that, in order to centralise commercial transactions in the various regions of Iran, the number of Chambers of Commerce will be restricted to sixteen. The revenues of these Chambers will be met by a tax of one per cent, on what is not stated—and all other existing Chambers of Commerce will be dissolved. 2. The following is a list of the 16 Chambers which will be authorised 1. Isfahan and province. 2. Ahwaz, including the whole province of Khuzistan, Khorram Chahr (Mohammerah), Shushtar and Dizful. 3. Babol, including the province of Mazanderan, Gurgan and Bander Gez. 4. Pahlevi, including the principal neighbouring centres. 5. Bander Abbas, including Qishm Island, Minab, Jask and Chahbahar. 6. Bushire, including the district between Lmgah and the boundary of Khuzistan. J 7. Tabriz, including Eastern and Western Azerbaijan. 8. Tehran, including Qum, Kazvin and Zendjan. 9.

The Board agree that the use of public funds for the establishment of a rest house could not be supported. 2. In the absence of any information as to the state of the market in Hamadan, it is impossible for the Board to put any price upon the property.

I have the honour to inform you that the press has recently announced the foundation of the “Touring Club of Iran” as part of the programme of developing the tourist industry in this country. The President of the Club is Monsieur Jam, Minister of the Interior, and among its leading figures are Monsieur Soheily and Monsieur Ansari of the Ministry ror Foreign Affairs, Doctor Sajadi the Director- General of Customs, Monsieur Amir Aslan the Director-General of Roads, and Mr. Ebtehaj, Head of the Travel and Propaganda Department of the Ministry of the Interior. 2. It is stated that the objects of the Club include the establishment of hotels and rest-houses for travellers, and of workshops for repairing motor-cars: the provision of information about roads and of guides to attend tourists, especially those from abroad *. the establishment of telephone posts and first-aid posts alon^ the main roads : and the provision of Customs facilities to members of the Club and of the International Touring Union who wish to cross the frontiers of the country . and in general the promotion of legislation for the encouragement of the tourist industry. 3. The establishment of the ambitious hotels owned by the Shah along the Caspian littoral has been a first step in exploiting the undoubted possibilities Iran as a tourists’ country. Recent reports however suggest that these hotels aio not likely to maintain the standard of comfort at which they aim. It is at any rate to be hoped that the newly founded Touring Club of Iran will do something to mi prove touring conditions. But it will certainly belong before the last is seen ol . t MS443FD128 endless red tape and innumerable irritating regulations and restrictions which in evitably discourage all but the most determined travellers from touring in Iran. 4.

Mr. Jam, the Minister of the Interior, is the President of a Committee con taining several notables, with Mr. Gholam Hossein Ibtehaj as Secretary. 3. The hotels which are being installed at several places, though not yet first class in detail, are certainly a great improvement on previous rest-houses, but the improvements are at present only in the north, chiefly in Gil an and Mazanderan: the traveller coming up from the south will not notice much difference yet, and will not find any sort of hotel or resting-house at Persepolis. 4.

The details of the reserve held against this latter amount, given as five hundred and twenty million, four hundred and eighty-four thousand, one hundred and seventy-two rials and fifty dinars, show that the gold handed over by the Government to the Bank m order to raise its capital to three hundred million rials as reported m my despatch No. 301-E, is also taken as part of the metallic reserve against the note issue. In the absence of any recent balance sheet of the Bank /Ik T&gt; an ’i lt; 18 dddcidt to under stand how this gold, forming the bulk of the capital ot tne Bank, can also be considered as statutory, or as any other sort of, reserve against notes in circulation. 4. If about seven hundred thousand pounds worth of silver has been, or is being shipped abroad, as mentioned in my despatch No. 411-E. of the 20th September' the silver reserve against the note issue will presumably have to be reduced by this amount, representing roughly sixty million rials, rxr 5 A m am sendm g copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade [No. 0.

The thirty-fourth report of the Board of Control of Reserves against bank notes and nickel coinage to the Prime Minister. By virtue of the substance of Article 9 of the Law amending the Law fixing the Unity of Money, approved on the 22nd Esfand, 1310 (13th March, 1932) and in continuance of previous reports which were drawn up and submitted separately every month, I have now the honour to submit the 34th report of the Board in con trol of Reserves mentioned in Article 9 of the said Law, for the period ending the 31st Tir, 1314 (23rd July, 1935). As according to the Law of 17th Tir, 1314 (9th July 1935), the National Bank’s capital has been increased to Rials three hundred million and on this account the Government has ceded to the Bank its property of 15,875,395-39 grammes net gold according to the rate provided in the Law of 22nd Esfand, 1310 (13th March 1932), namely, at 0-07322382 gramme per Rial, totalling Rials 216,806,435-25 and the Bank earmarked all this gold for reserve against Bank notes at the very same rate, therefore, the following is a brief account of the amount of Bank notes in circulation and the reserve held against it, during the last 10 months :—• The amount of Bank notes at the disposal of the National Bank for circulation. At the end of Mehr, 1313 (22nd October, 1934) . At the end of Aban, 1313 (21st November, 1934) At the end of Azar, 1313 (21st December, 1934) . At the end of Dey, 1313 (21st January, 1935) At the end of Bahman, 1313 (19th February, 1935). At the end of Esfand, 1313 (21st March, 1935) At the end of Farvardin, 1314 (21st April, 1935) At the end of Urdibehesht, 1314 (22nd May, 1935). At the end of Khordad, 1314 (22nd June, 1935) At the end of Tir, 1314 (22nd May, 1935) Evidently, a part of the Bank notes placed at the disposal of the National Bank for circulation is always available at the Central Cash Offices as well as the Branch Offices and this should therefore not be considered as in circulation and call for an equal reserve against it; but as it is a difficult matter for the Board in control of funds on reserve to make a daily inspection of such part of Bank notes which is not in circulation, the Board has therefore reported them always as Bank notes in cir culation, as, for instance, at the end of Tir, 1314, out of Rials 491,553,450 Bank notes placed at the disposal of the National Bank for circulation, Rials, 50,714,932-50 have been available at the Bank’s Cash Offices and only the other Rials 439,512,960 have been in circulation. Thus the Rials 520,484,172-50 kept on reserve are equal to 118% of the amount of notes in circulation. There are two keys to the Treasuries where Reserves against Bank notes are being preserved.

With reference to my despatch No. 552-E. of 15th December 1934 [Serial No. (134) in F. No. 1-N./34], I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a cutting from “Le Journal de Teheran” of to-day, publishing a new law, with effect as from 17th October, revising the taxes on oil products laid down by the law of 6th December, 1934. 2. The revised taxes are :— (a) thirty dinars (about point eight four seven of a penny at eighty-five rials to the pound) on each litre of petrol and paraffin, or Rials five and dinars forty (about one shilling and three pence farthing) per four gallon tin. (b) ten dinars (about point two eight pence) on each litre of combustible fuel for engines. The previous tax was twenty dinars (about point six of a penny) per litre on both categories. 3. The Minister of Finance, who submitted the Bill for which he requested double urgency, explained that the new refinery recently opened at Kermanshah enable the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to market their products in the northern, eastern and other districts of Iran at lower prices in view of the saving in transport costs. 4. The individual consumer of petrol and paraffin obtains no relief from the lower prices ; the Government will benefit to the extent of half of the reduction, whilst industrial institutions will benefit by the fifty per centum reduction in the tax for their motor fuel. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade [No. O. T.

The line will not go through Burujird or Malayer but will branch eastward from Bahrein and then north to Sultanabad. The new alignment will be 72 kilometres shorter than the previous one and it appears the ground lends itself better for rail way construction. The change has been sanctioned by His Imperial Majesty the Shah. 5. The basic value figures given in the attached statement show a total estimat ed value for Lots 6 to 19 in the north, the Tehran Station and Lots 1 to 12 in the South, amounting to Rials 1,069,900,000 ; after deduction of the rebate the value becomes Rials 850,179,260 or, at a nominal rate of 85 Rials to the £, approximately £12,587,000 and £10,000,000 respectively. These figures, however, afford but a rough idea of the cost of the construction as the basic values of the lots are very roughly estimated merely as a basis for contractors to submit their offers of rebate. I understand that when a lot is completed a careful survey in detail is made by the Kampsax engineers who fix the estimated value of the construction done at fixed prices for work on rock, earth, bridges, tunnels etcetera. The stipulated rebate is deducted from this new value, which may naturally differ considerably from the initial rough estimate. 6.

(92) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 451, dated the 19th October 1935. I Lave endeavoured at intervals to furnish you with a brief review of Anglo- Persian relations, basing my estimate on the degree of goodwill shown by the Iranian Oovernment in dealing with current affairs. Though there is at present little to report beyond the normal conduct of current business, it may be of use if, on the eve of my departure for India, I attempt a further review of the situations. 2. I feel that it is safe to state that the improved atmosphere of which I spoke in my despatch No. 252 of June 12th [Serial No. (1) of File No. 489-N. 35] has been maintained. On the negative side there has been no recurrence of that hostile mind edness of which we had so much cause for complaint a year ago at the time of the Tamb incident, and the trouble over the appointment of Consuls from the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India. Since the evacuation of Henjam and Basidu we have heard surprisingly little of Gulf matters, while all our applications for approval of the appointment of members of the Foreign and Politic al Department to consular posts have been accepted. On the positive side most of the minor outstanding matters have been settled, notably the case of Mrs. Hart, while others have been arrowed down to less significant proportions. The “ Garmsir ” incident is an unfortunate exception. The last stage of this affair is described in your despatch No. 451 of the 28th August last. It does not redound to the credit of the Iranian Government but it would perhaps seem justifiable to re gard this isolated incident as a thing of the past. Recent months have been noticeably free from difficulties of this kind and where cases have occurred requir ing representations to the Iranian Government I have invariably encountered a helpful attitude in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs I would mention m particular the case of the wholesale order for the expulsion of Berbena after the disturbances in the Shrine at Meshed. This case was last reported on m my despatch No. 419 of the 2nd October. 3 Turning to wider issues, the one question of direct interest to Iran which has been on the tapis is that of the Irano-Iraq frontier negotiations. In my earlier despatches I expressed apprehension that loss of the Persian case at Geneva or failure espatcnes 1 e p pp Baghdad would react unfavourable upon Anglo- MS443FDopened here in August have so far produced no settlement. It fell to His Majesty’s Legation, during the presence of the Iraq delegation in Tehran, to keep in close touch with both sides. The most that I can say is that I have so far seen no sign of any attempt to saddle us with the blame for the absence of agreement. On the side of the Iraq delegation I was treated with the utmost frankness. On the Iranian side less so. But I still see no reason to suppose that, provided a settlement is ulti mately reached on the basis of the cession to Persia of an anchorage off Abadan, there need be any tendency to accuse me of having favoured Iraq as against Iran. 4. Of less direct concern but perhaps more important in its potential significance to this country is the crisis between Italy and Abyssinia. I his has been watched here with the closest interest and it is no exaggeration to say that in proportion as Italian designs have unfolded themselves and the attitude of His Majesty’s Gov ernment has become more clearly understood, Persian official and public opinion has turned more and more against Italy and has shown an increasing appreciation of, and sympathy with, the British standpoint. The whole episode has contributed very greatly to inspire respect for Great Britain. While Italian efforts at propaganda have been strenuously resisted, I have encountered entire readiness and even anxiety to make the British point of view known through the Press. 5. If there is one quarter in which the position must be recognised as distinct ly less satisfactory it is in Eastern Persia. Complaints frequently reach me of the ill-treatment of British Indian subjects, the unfriendly attitude of the local authorities, the unfair compulsion employed and the inadequate payment made in requisitioning British-owned lorries, the obstacles placed in the way of British Indian lorry drivers in plying on Persian roads, the difficulties and even hardship encountered by pilgrims passing through from India and so forth. These reports indicate a thoroughly unsatisfactory situation, for which however I am inclined to hold the local authorities rather than the Central Government mainly responsible. It is quite clear that His Majesty’s Consul-General and other Consular officers in East Persia are faced with great difficulties owing to the refusal of the Iranian authorities to allow them to communicate with any officials except the local civilian Govern ors. This isolation produces misunderstanding and distrust and, when coupled with a habit on the part of the Iranian authorities of sending distorted accounts to Tehran when ordered to report on any case, aggravates a situation already rendered uncomfortable by the continued representations and protests necessitated in de fence of local British interests. I shall, while in India, have the privilege of dis cussing this whole question with the Government of India and it is to be hoped that means may be devised whereby an improvement may be brought about in a situa tion which, as I have said, is at present extremely unsatisfactory. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Gov ernment of India (No. 223), to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 92), and to The Honourable the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf (No. 102). (93) (Received on 26th October 1935, with Political Secretary’s Letter No. 11, dated the 10th October 1935.) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London No. 356, dated the 17th August 1935. With reference to Sir R. Clive’s despatch No. 306 of the 15th June 1931, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a copy of a circular issued by the General Registration Department regarding the ownership of land by foreign subjects. 2. As you are aware, foreign subjects are only allowed to own immovable pro- perty in Iran for their residence or place of business, unless their country has a special treaty position. 1 he object of the enclosed circular would appear to be to make it clear that foreign subjects should not accept mortgages on immovable property since they will have no right of foreclosure unless the land in question is admitted to be for their residence or place of business. Further, the RegistrationDepartment or other authority charged with the sale of immovable property may not accept an offer from a foreign subject unless the use of property as residence or place of busmens has been approved. Enclosure to Serial No. (93). Circular issued by the Registration Department. The following circular has been issued by the General Registration Department to the Registry Offices in the capital and the provinces :— WJicTcas Article II of the Nationality Law, approved on the 16th Shahrivar, 1308 (7th September 1929), which was recently sanctioned by the Mejliss as Article 968 of the Civil Code, prohibits wives of foreign nationals from possession of immov able property except within the limits stipulated by law, and lays down that if they exceed those limits in appropriation of property they must, within a period of one year, transfer the same to Iranian subjects, failing which the property will be sold under the supervision of the Public Prosecutor of the Primary Court in accord ance with the stipulations of the law of the 16th Khordad 1310 (7th June 1934), and Whereas in Section 4 of Article 2 (Annex. No. 5) of the Law granting Concession to the Imperial Bank of Persia it is stipulated that in mortgage transactions the Bank can hold ownership of mortgaged properties for no longer than one year, and Whereas occorJw^o the Notification No. 10548 of the 8th Mordad 1308 (July 30th, 1929) of the Ministry of Justice, applications for registration received from foreign nationals cannot be granted if they are for cases other than those permitted in the Treaties, unless the national concerned gives a written document to the effect that within a period of one year from the date of his application he will transfer the property to an Iranian subject and Whereas by wirtue of Note No. 15312 of the 3rd Mordad, 1313 (25th July, 1934) of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, no foreign nationals are authorised to acquire or possess immoveable property more than what they need for their dwelling and business, therefore, in view of the foregoing, mortgage and hypothecation transactions in favour of nationals of friendly countries, setting up in fact a sort of possession and occupation and right will be prohibited. Nevertheless, as legal regulations consider from an economic viewpoint hypothecation and mort gage transactions as commercial and loan transactions, they are therefore not affected by Treaties and Regulations unless the Registration Office concerned would be bound to issue a document of transfer. Thus the right of ownership by foreign nationals would have legal justification when such right has been acquired in accordance with Treaties and Regulations. In view of the above, therefore, whenever foreign nationals wish to avail themselves of the provisions of Article 34 of the Law of Registration in connection with a winning tender for a property then can be issued with a document of ownership only when they are entitled to owner ship in accordance with Treaties. In such cases the Registration Offices are enjoined, after conclusion of a tender, to refer to the General Registration Department for permission to issue document of ownership, so that mthe event of absence of legal right to the possession of the property issue of document of ownership would be refused.” [Published in the Official Gazette No. 1959 of the 8th Murdad, 1314 (31st July 1935).] Extract from Translation of the law of registratim of landed properties and docu- ZHZlaZg to various transaJitm enact'd by the Persian Government dated Harnal 1302 (March 22nd 1923 April 20th 1923).

Despatch from His Majesty’s Legation, Gulhak, No. 212, dated the 14th September 1935. (97) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, dated the 26th September 1935. My Belgian Colleague came to see me the other day and asked me if I had heard anything of a project to build a railway from Tehran to Tabriz. I said I had not. He evidently thought it was a live ssue and asked me whether, in view of the unlike lihood of any British syndicate getting the contract, I would agree to his suggest ing to Brussels that the Societe-Generale or some other body should try for it on the understanding he said, that they would take British interests into combina tion with themselves in carrying it out. He said it was not intended to give the contract to Kampsax. 2. I told him that, speaking personally, I saw no objection to his proposal though of course I could not say whether any British syndicate would be competing sepa rately.3 All our information, however, is to the effect that such a proiect is most unlikely, at any rate as an immediate issue. With their existing financial resources the Iranians will be very hard pressed indeed to complete even the North-South line without contracting a foreign loan, and they would be unlikely to add to their difficulties by takmg on a liability for another fifteen to twenty million pounds until the financial drain on the present line is finished. 1 4. Urquhart has now reported from Tabriz that a Swedish firm are to build a new terminus for the Tabriz-Julfa railway. This is to be inside the city and will mean a great improvement, as the existing station is miles outside. I imagine that an mtencification of traffic over thi s line is anticipated as a result of the recent Irano-Soviet commercial agreement. 5. It seems to me possible that Paternotte has heard a glorified version of this report. I am sending a copy of this letter to Picton Bagge. (98) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 495, dated the 11th November 1935. The eighteenth anniversary of the Russian Revolution has produced in the principal organs of the Iranian press a long article, presumably written in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, of a distinctly complimentary nature. I have the honour to enclose a cutting from the “Journal de Teheran”, a semi-official news paper, which seems to be a French translation of what has appeared in the verna cular press. 2. The exhibition of Iranian Art at Leningrad has been made the pretext for a lot of pro-Soviet manifestation. The acting Minister of Education went there with a large official following and the Tehran press made much play with this visit and the exchange of courtesies which it involved. 3. I imagine that since the Shah’s visit to Turkey he has been impressed with the utility of the Turkish policy of friendly relations with the Soviet Government and he may have been convinced by Ataturk that present day Russia does not offer a military threat to this country. I find it hard, however, to believe that the Shah has come to love the Soviet Government as dearly as the press articles indicate; it is rather a case of cupboard love perhaps, for His Majesty likes to get a good price for the rice grown in his Caspian provinces. 4.

It may he presumed that half of this sum is being used for exchange stabilisation and the other half is left in reserve. If this metal is in effect considered as part of the reserve against the note issue, it should (as well as the gold held in London) be brought to Tehran where it is proposed, according to General Khosrovi, to cen tralise all the reserves. 5. According to another account appearing in the C£ Setareh-ye-Djehan”, the gathering at which this speech was made was primarily a social function, and the Governor’s exposition of the state of the Bank’s finances came as a surprise to his guests. It was followed by a tour of the strong rooms of the Bank, which reads rather like a visit to Aladdin’s cave. The speech has been reported with prominence in the press, which of course seizes the opportunity to indulge in ful some adulation the work of His Majesty the Shah in building up the economic prosperity of the country. Much is also made of the Bank’s new building (still far from complete) with all its appurtenances, from the swimming bath to these special printing establishment for the production of bank notes, etc. The import ance of this adjunct need hardly be emphasised. In general the meeting seems to have been given an amount of publicity out of proportion to the real value of the information vouchsafed, and it is difficult to avoid the suspicion that it was in tended as eyewash to cover less pleasant realities. 6.

With reference to paragraph 3 of my predecessor’s despatch No. 458-E. of 17th October, 1934, in which he reported Japanese endeavours to obtain the con cession of rock salt deposits in South Iran, I have the honour to inform you of the following report from His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman. The Governor of Qishm, during the course of conversations, stated that the Japanese have bought three hundred thousand tons of salt from the Iranian Government at the rate of rials sixteen (about four shillings) per ton. He said he was going to visit Qishm Island to fix a suitable place for the construction of a pier and railroad for trollies at the expense of the Japanese. Mining and all other expenses are also to be incurred by them. 2. According to the C£ Itela ’at ” of the 17th September last, a Company has been formed at Tehran for the extraction of salt from the mines of Qishm Island and elsewhere in the Persian Gulf. According to the “ Iran,” the capital of this company is Rials five hundred thousand, in five hundred shares of Rials one thousand, all paid. There is at present no sign of Japanese participation in the Company but, in view of the report from Kerman, it is possible that some arrangement has been made between them. 3.

Prime Minister resigned last night on grounds of ill-health. (104) Extract from Tebriz Diary No. 7 for August 1935. (Received in Foreign Office, October 7). Section B.-l. Hats and Veils. Now that Kemal Ataturk will not, according to report, visit Iran before next year, there is not the same urgency to have all men hatted and women unveiled. Nevertheless, the authorities are moving on steadily with their programme. Des pite vague rumours of slight trouble, said to have been quashed by numerous arrests, in Ardebil about the 20th August, the hat question is already past history in Azer baijan, and attention is turning to veils. On the 6th August, celebrated as Con stitution Day, the Governor-General read publicly a message from the Shah in which he thanked Azerbaijan for its loyal compliance with his wishes. The citizens of Tabriz replied that his wishes were to them the commands of a God. One must make allowances for oriental exaggeration, but, even so, the fact remains that the Shah has this province grovelling at his feet. There is no one in sight who would dare to oppose him, and unless something very unexpected happens, this formerly fanatical city of Tabrez will be among the first of the provincial cities to unveil its women. The first move was made by the Governor-General on the 15th August, when he summoned the leading merchants and reminded them that the Shah desired that the women of Iran should unveil; he suggested that they ought accordingly to prepare their families for the change. Then on the 20th the Director of Education summoned the women teachers, gave them tea and told them to unveil. They did so, and faced a curious but queit crowd as they left. Since then individual women teachers have been spat upon and had bad fruit thrown at them, but the police will doubtless put an end to that quite easily. Meantime, it is remarked that these teachers, who have had to unveil to keep their jobs, are getting no support from the wives of officials and merchants as yet. It is taken for granted that they will all have to comply quite soon, but for the moment there is a hesitancy, each man watching his neighbour. Local Government. The Department of Finance produced two scandals in August. A dismissed employee denounced the chief of his branch, and it was found that this officialwas collecting, and giving receipts for, amounts in excess of legal taxes, while he accounted only for the legal amount in his books. Receipts were called in and discrepancies amounting to tens of thousands of rials were traced. In the second case a collector of taxes, having apparently created difficulties for a landowner m the neighbourhood of Tabrez, offered to remove them for a payment of 1,000 rials. The landowner agreed to pay, but meantime denounced the collector to the police, who lay in concealment while the transaction took place and arrested him at the end of it. These are ordinary enough events. The interest lies in comment offered in connexion with them. It is said that five years ago, while the Shah was still popu larly regarded as a righter of wrong and a pillar of uprightness, officials feared to be caught in dishonesty lest they be hanged. These two latest culprits, however, took no special precautions in their dishonesty, and although they have been sent to Tehran, it is not expected that they will suffer any very drastic or lasting dis grace because the whole Administration is similarly dishonest, or so at least the people believe. They also believe that His Majesty is one of the richest men in the world to-day. Education. A project is on foot to establish a medical school at Tabriz at a cost of 60,000 rials. Arrangements had been made to begin co-education of boys and girls in a primary school near Julfa, but it now appears that for some reason the experiment will not be made. It was reported in last month’s diary that the Department of Education might purchase the remaining American Mission properties at Rezaieh. The deal has now been completed and the authorities have acquired for 300,000 rials one house, a hospital building (to be used as a dormitory), a large garden, etc. The Americans consider that these were worth 400,000 rials, but are pleased, on the whole to have been able to liquidate. Military Affairs. It appears that work on the new aerodrome is held up for the time being for lack of money. The hangars are well advanced, but four at least still lack roofs. Section B.-2.

With reference to Foreign Office letter E.-6354/146/34, of 30th October enclosing a copy of a letter from the Chancery of His Majesty’s Embassy at Berhn on the subject of commercial relations between Germany and Persia, I am directed by Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare to request you to lay before the Board of Trade the accompanying copy of a despatch in which His Majesty s Minister at Tehran surveys the extent of German influence in Peisia at the present day. 2. Sir Samuel Hoare would welcome the observations of the Board upon the possibility of taking steps to counter the advance of German influence in the com mercial sphere, insofar as its manifestations are likely to prove prejudicial to British interests. 3. A copy of this letter is being sent to the India Office, Colonial Office, War Office, Admiralty, Air Ministry, the Department of Overseas Trade and Treasury. Despatch from His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 425, dated the 3rd October 1935. Tehran at the moment provides an alluring hunting-ground (it would he rash as yet to use the adjective “ happy ”) for the agents of foreign firms seeking industrial contracts. The railway, factories, bridges, ports, and so on, attract the attention of companies in almost all the industrial countries of the world, and the Tehran hotels are full of business men who arrive asserting optimistically that they will only be staying for a few days, but who usually find that it takes weeks or even months before they succeed in getting a contract signed. 2. One of the most noticeable features of all this activity is the ubiquity of German agents, and I have therefore thought it well to cause a review to be made of the extent of German influence in this country, particularly in the commercial sphere. In the first place, I would invite attention to the size of the German colony in Tehran, which is said to number about 400 and to be increasing. Considering the fact that there is no one single German interest of any outstanding size and that the members of the colony are not for the most part of the artisan class, as are, for instance, the Italians, this figure is in itself remarkable. German commercial agents and representatives are now playing one of the leading roles in the business life of the European community here, and German exports (dutiable) in 1933-34 were more than double those in the year 1927-28. Industrial develop ments -and contracts for railway material are, of course, to a great extent respon sible, but this does not alter the fact that German interests have shown great energy in seizing their opportunities. 3. It has recently been brought to my notice that the Industrial School, which is under the managership of a German, Dr. Strunk, has been transferred from the control of the Ministry of Education to that of the Department of Com merce. The former were always short of funds and the activities of the school suffered accordingly; but it is expected that the latter will now accord it more generous treatment. It is also now proposed to provide a German teaching staff for the new industrial schools which are being established at various centres in the provinces, and particularly at Isfahan, Meshed and Tabriz. I also learn that an order has recently been placed with Krupps for a quantity of mining equipment. Details are not available, but the contract is not unlikely to be connected with a scheme which is on hand to erect a foundry for manufacturing girders, pipes, etc., as I have learnt from another source that the proposal to give Tehran a proper water and drainage system has been held up owing to the insistence of the Shah that the pipes must be manufactured in this country. I would also invite attention to the report contained in the commercial secretary s O.T. (B) despatch No. 219 of the 19th September, that German firm is negotiating for the quasi-monopoly of the export of the Hormuz red oxide for a term of two years, one of the conditions being that the Germans would start a monthly shipping service to Gulf ports, the ships to be manned to a great extent by Iranians. r i he attachment of a German engineer to the Iranian navy fordry-dock construction and the report that a German expert is being engaged to manage the newly-formed Iranian insurance company (see my despatch No. 428-E. of the 3rd October) are also signs of activity which deserve notice. The Iranian economic mission to Berlin, which formed the subject of my despatch No. 330-E. of the 26th July last, has been rather put in the shade by the more important mission which has just been visiting Leningrad for the Exhibition of Iranian Art, but the newspapers have more than once referred in this connexion to the importance of good relations between Iran and Germany, and doubtless the mission has succeeded in arranging a certain amount of business during its stay in Berlin. 4. Outside the commercial sphere it is difficult to give facts and figures, but the new German Minister appears to be very active in looking after the colony being at home to them, I hear, every Friday. The illustrated paper Iran-i-Bastan is certainly subsidised by the Legation and is always full of pictures of Nazi Germany; and it is interesting to note that the Iran is now publishing an increasing number of photographs illustrating German doings. I have not heard of any subsidy being paid to the latter paper, but I should not wonder if it was being supported, too. 5. In general, I have the impression that the modern type of Nationalist Iranian is inclined to admire Herr Hitler and to compare him to the Shah ! It is known that the proposals to make us all talk of Iran in future instead of Persia emanated from the Persian Minister at Berlin, and I rather believe that the movement to aryanise the language, involving the change of all military titles and the giving of new names to Arab towns like Mohammerah, is to some extent also inspired by ideas drawn from German ideology. Even the anti-clerical move ment in Germany probably rather appeals to those here who are busy undermining what is left of moslem religious feeling. 6. I have left to the last two very important aspects of the matter; one is the question of German influence in the army and the other the possible repercussions on German policy of the diversion elsewhere of Italian energies. As to the first, the military attache states that German influence appears to be small, and I only mention it because my Belgian colleague voiced to me earlier this year his fears lest one day we sould see a German military mission here. M. Paternotte appeared to have no special grounds for his apprehension, except for a general fear that the Germans would seize any opportunity to step m wherever they could, but he said that he had warned the Belgian mission that they should be careful not to do anything which might antagonise the Ministry of War and bring about their dismissal. It was not, he had said to them, their duty to be too exacting in their methods of training or too insistent that all their ideas should be accepted by the authorities. There was no question but that it was their job to give the Iranian air force the best training that was possible but the important thing in the interests of Belgium was that the Iranian forces should draw their advisers from the ranks of the ex-Allies, and ** was there essential that nothing should ever be done which would lead the Shah to dismiss them and perhaps put Germans in their place. 7 I have no information on the other point which I have raised, namely, the possible effect on German policy of Italian preoccupations m Aby ss ima 1 only desire at present to draw attention to it His Majesty s consul at Ahi , who was recently in Tehran, told me that he to their Italian artisans who were employed on e rai way .

With reference to Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen’s despatch No. 450-E., of 18th October last, I have the honour to inform you that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited have reduced only the price of their petrol, with effect on 1st November. The reduction, on builk sales, works out, I understand, at about two Rials (five decimal six pence) per tin of eighteen litres. In effect the car owner in Tehran now pays ten dinars (about decimal two of a penny) less than formerly for five litres of petrol from the pumping stations which are supplied in bulk by the Company. 2. In the provinces at greater distances from the refineries where the cost of petrol was higher than at Tehran, the saving will no doubt be more appreciable, as it appears that prices in the provinces may be brought more in line with the price at Tehran. 3. With reference to paraffin, not only have the Company been unable to reduce the price but they have recently slightly increased it. 4. According to Mr. Binns of Messrs. Leyland Limited, Tehran, the annual sales of petrol, Iranian and Soviet, amount approximately to three million, seven hundred and fifty thousand tins (of eighteen litres) and of paraffin two million, seven hundred and thirty-three thousand, three hundred tins. The yearly revenue from the excise tax would therefore be in the neighbourhood of thirty eight million, two hundred and fifty thousand rials (about four hundred and forty-five thousand punds). 5.

(Ill) Endorsement from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 454, dated the 19th October 1935. His Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Prin cipal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit herewith, copies of the documents mentioned in the subjoined Schedule, on the subject of opening of new Oil Refinery at Kermanshah. Enclosure to Serial No. (111). Despatch from His Majesty’s Consul, Kermanshah, to His Majesty’s Minis ter, Tehran, No. 33, dated the 12th October 1935. I have the honour to inform you that on Thursday last, October 10th at the invitation of the Manager of the Kermanshah Petroleum Company, Limited, I witnessed the opening of the oil refinery here. 2. The opening ceremony was performed by His Excellency Mohammad Ali, Foroughi, Prime Minister of Iran, supported by the Ministers of Interior and Finance and the Director-General of the Department of Commerce and Industry. After a tour of the refinery, during which the mysteries of oil refining were explained to him by Mr. Elkington, Abadan General Manager of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Limited, the Prime Minister declared the refinery open by cutting a festoon of green, white and red ribbons stretched across one of the gateways whereupon a fleet of loaded tank lorries drove oh to various destinations. 3. After the opening ceremony the guests were entertained to luncheon by the company and short speeches were made by Mr. Elkington and by the Prime Minister in reply. Mr. Elkington’s speech, which wms in Persian, but rendered somewhat unintelligible by the fact that he was very nervous and did not appear to understand what he was reading, did not seem to depart from what is customary on such occasions. At its end he proposed the Shah’s health. In his reply the Prime Minister expressed the Shah’s regret that he had been unable to be present and his satisfaction that there was now a refinery in existence capable of supplying the needs of northern and western Iran. He did not go out of his way to express any special thanks to the company for satisfying the Imperial desires but seemed rather to consider the matter as a duty which had been no more than adequately discharged. He, too, proposed the Shah's health so that altogether the company got scant recognition for their pains. I do not think, however, that they expected more. It had been intended to present the Prime Minister with a gold and marble inkstand in honour of the occasion. Unfortunately the inkstand which cost some £600 arrived badly damaged. No formal presentation, therefore, took place.Instead the inkstand which had been patched up sufficiently to he on show was quietly put in the Prime Minister’s car before he left. 4. I attach a copy of the official programme of the day’s proceedings which is of interest in that it gives a sketch map of the pipe line and a sketch plan of the lay-out of the refinery itself and also for the almost painful striving in its language to avoid the use of words of Arabic origin. The document is believed to he, in the main, the work of M. Mustapha Fateh, Distribution Manager in Tehran. 5. The refinery is now working very nearly to full production, the “ through put ” at present being in the neighbourhood of 60,000 gallons a day which will shortly be increased to 70,000. 6. It is understood that the final cost of the whole installation including pipe line, refinery and distribution depots in northern Iran will be some £750,000. 7. A copy of this despatch is being sent to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad and to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz.

Unfortunately, he himself, throug extravagance and the lessened possibilities nowadays for avoiding the payment of taxes had been obliged to sell much of his estates m many cases for considerably less than their true value. In one district, that of Kanduleh, it appears that the peasantry are buying from him the land on which they work This will presum ably result in the gradual creation of a class of peasant free-holders, such as as existed in France since the French Revolution, and may well be the next deielop- ment of land tenure in Iran. The old-fashioned Iranian andlord was rarely sufficiently interested in the management of his estates to get anything like am return from them. Though this did not matter much when he could easily avoid all taxation, things have changed now and much land is m consequence changing hands. While this means the gradual extinction of the power and influence of the old families it may not be a bad thing in the end, as should the peasantry obtain possession of the land they work they will get more out of it than before, and if moneyed man buys it he will probably be a man of some commercial acumen who has acquired his fortune in recent years and will therefore also be m a position to get a better yield. Of the general condition of the people it was hard to judge for their standards even at the best are so very low. The majority of the villages I passed throug seemed fairly prosperous with some exceptions. Of these, one was Zalu Ab, a village of some twelve families situated in a valley directly to the north of the Ivuh-i- Parrau. Here the “ houses ’’ used in cold weather were nothing more than rougu caves hollowed out of the hillside. It was impossible to obtain either an egg or a chicken here. Bisitun, too, seems to be slowly dying. Though from the motor- road the area of houses seems quite large, at least half of those are empty as is the big caravanserai there. This, which, for its upkeep, was endowed with the revenue from three villages nearby, is no longer used at all, and the upkeep money goes instead into the pocket of the mutawalli, a member of the Zanganeh family. Although I was always received with civility and friendliness no undue interest was taken in mv movements or actions.

I lunched yesterday with M. Carnal, headmaster of Le Rosey school, and saw zhe Crown Prince of Persia (“ saw ” because I was not introduced and did not like to press the matter on the first occasion). The latter is tall and well built (lacking the usual miniature-like Persian finesse) and is an excellent all-round athletic, being especially prominent in the football field. He is in fact one of Le Rosey’s crack players. I am told all six brothers are extremely intelligent, and the Crown Prince exceptionally so, besides being a hard- worker. At the close of the last school year, he won the Prix d’Excellence for work and he hopes to be allowed to spend one more year at the school in order to get his Baccalaureat in Lausanne. Besides the usual curriculum, the boys have daily Persian lessons with a tutor, specially appointed for this purpose by their father. This man, who lives in Rolle, treats the Crown Prince with the greatest deference and is said to be genuinely horrified whenever one of the other pupils slaps H. I. M, on the back! The only other persons who treats the young man in a similar manner is the Aga Khan, who frequently comes to Le Rosey to pay homage, and mvanab y backs out of the room, etc. At the school, the Crown Prince is treated just like the other hoys, who even “ tutover ” him, the only difference lying in certain privileges such as not hhng in and^out of meals with the other boys, a room to himself, etc. I enquired o one of the masters whether the Persian boys did not show an entirely diffe ent mentalitv whether they were spoiled in any way or fitted with some difficulty into these new surroundings.

Tlie resignation of His Excellency Moliamed Ali Ferouglii from tlie office of President of the Council of Ministers was briefly reported in my telegram No. 361 of December 2nd last. At that time it was already generally believed that the statement that Ais Excellency’s resignation was on grounds of ill health was a polite fiction. The announcement had appeared in the press in the briefest form and much comment had been aroused by the fact that the was merely referred to as “ Feroughi the Prime Minister ” without any honorifics or even the prefix of “ Agha ” or “ Monsieur 2. It is now clear that Monsieur Feroughi’s resignation was not voluntary, although he has for some months past been suffering from heart attacks and there is no doubt that in ordinary circumstances he would have been glad to be relieved of the burden of office and to return to his library. The United States’ Minister on the very day of His Excellency’s dismissal had received an acceptance from him of an invitation to dine a fortnight later but on December 4th a telephone message was received to the effect that he would not now be able to attend. This proves that the “ resignation ” was unexpected. 3. Various reasons are assigned for Monsieur Feroughi’s downfall. The most probable is that he intervened on behalf of his son-in-law, Assadi, who was recently dismissed from the post of chief custodian of the Shrine at Meshed and brought under arrest to Tehran where it is believed that he will be tried for malversation of the Shrine funds. Another story is that His Excellency had been ordered by the Shah to accelerate the movement for the unveiling of women but had ignored the Royal Command. This story is connected with the strong rumour that all women are to be unveiled at the end of Ramazan. 4. Monsieur Feroughi has been continually in office, first as Minister for Foreign Affairs and then as Prime Minister for the last five years and his disappearance is widely regretted among the Diplomatic Corps where his gentleness and courtesy combined with genuine literary taste and learning have made him a respected figure. He has never been an active politician and it is doubtful whether he has often dared to stand up to the Shah as he appears to have done on this last and fateful occasion. 5. The new Prime Minister, Monsieur Mahmoud Jan, has always been on excellent terms with His Majesty’s Legation and is courteous and obliging thong les^intellectual than his predecessor. I imagine that he will prove to be an even more pliant instrument of the Shah’s will. 6.

PERSIA SERIES. &lt;« Despatch teom His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Oefice, London, No. 15-F., dated the 11th Januany 1935. Li Sir Reginald Hoare’s despateh No. 431-E. of September 22nd last, reference was made in paragraph 11 to the possibility of extensive smuggling or silver coins aoroad loiiowuig me staoilization of the rial at a rate well below its intrinsic value. The low rate of about eighty rials to the pound which was maintained during 1934, with a view to assist the export trade, whilst the silver value of the pound was sometimes as low as rials sixty-nine, resulted in con siderable contraband exports of the metal, and shortage of silver rials has been Teported from various districts. Towards the end of December the National Bank reduced the rate, which had touched eighty-two rials, to seventy-six rials to the pound within a few days. The following extract from the December Diary of His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah is of interest in this con nexion .— “ Till the rate was lowered towards the end of the month the temptation to smuggle silver out of Persia was great and local stocks became very short. For some while the National Bank paid out no metal except damaged silver or nickel. Yet the fear of the authorities was sufficient to prevent any signs of a run on that Bank. Con fidence in the notes naturally has decreased. At Qasr-i-Shirin they were quoted at a 12 per cent, discount on silver, but no one ^ ' ventured to quote a rate publicly here. ” 2. The Commercial Secretary was informed that towards the end of December, before the rate of exchange was reduced, smuggled silver from Persia was arriving at Baghdad at the rate of one milliom rials (twelve thousand five hundred pounds) per week. No doubt the same thing was happening over other frontiers, and probably a fair amount was going to India •either direct or through Afghanistan. Even with the rate of rials seventy-six to the pound it is probably still profitable, but the fact that the rate has re mained at that figure may mean that: a check, perhaps only temporary, has been effected on these illicit exports* 3. 1 am told that, since the change in the rates, the National Bank are refusing to sell forward foreign exchange. This tends to confirm the view that the Bank are not likely to raise the rial to a higher exchange value, and that as soon as they can conveniently do so-they will mark it down again. Possibly in the meantime they may take steps to ‘f attract ” as many silver coins into their coffers as possible, but it is doubtful whether this measure would have any real success. 4 . The proposal of the National Bank, reported in my despatch No. 517-E. of November 27th last [Serial No. (128) in F. No. 1-N.|34], for the adoption of the gold standard by Persia, seems unlikely to be accepted in the near future, and I was told a few weeks ago that it had been rejected by the Council of Ministers. There are already rumours, which in the circumstances are not suprising, that the authorities intend at an early date to debase the coinage hy reducing the silver content of the rial hy one half. 5. In view of these problems, the position of Colonel Khosrovi, the Persian Director of the National Bank, is no sinecure, and it remains to be seen whether he can maintain it with the rather slender technical experience at his command. If he brings the rial rate approximately to silver point he could probably stop the smuggling' and hoarding of silver, but at the cost of inflicting an impose nc burden on the export trade: If he depreciates the value of the rial, or attempt, XS2@SFI&gt;„ ommintci of silver will certainly be lost.

With reference to Sir K.

Muhammad Javad Khan Isfandiary (Sardar Iqbal). Ali Mardan Khan Chahar-Lang. Gudarz Ahmad Khusruvi Bakhtiari. Sartip Khan Boir-Ahmedi. Shukrullah Khan Boir-Ahmedi. Hussein Khan Darehshuri Qashqai. Imam Quli Khan Mamassani. 9 On the following day a further list appeared of twenty persons sentenced to various terms of imprisonment, and of eight persons exonerated from blame and set at liberty, as follows •— . _ Imprisonment for life- Muhammad Taqi Khan Asad (Amir Jang).

Habibullak Khan Isfandiari. Ali Muhammad Khan Ilkhan. Elias Khan Ilkhan. 3. Sardar Fateh was a well-known Bakhtiari, one of the sons of the late Haji Imam Quli Khan. He was described in 1910 as “ a pleasant young man, without much character, and fond of drink He enjoyed a reputation for poetic ability, and possessed a considerable library of his own. He sided against the Government in the abortive rebellion of 1929 (see annual report for 1929, paragraph 233), and is said to have drawn up the detailed plans for the capture of Isfahan and Tehran and the deposition of the Shah. He was well known to Mr. Monypenny and several other consular officers, by whom'he was generally liked. Sardar Iqbal, the son of Isfandiar Khan, was described in 1909 as “a pleasant young man, and friendly to the British, though deficient in force of character'”. He has entertained several British travellers at various times. He is said to have been against the Government in 1929. Ali Mardan Khan Chahar-Lang, the son of Bibi Mariam, is mentioned in the above-quoted paragraph of the 1929 annual report as receiving a pardon. I have not yet been able to trace any record of Gudarz Ahmed Khusruvi Bakhtiari, but believe him to be one of the lesser khans who sided with Sardar Fateh and his companions in 1929. 4. The remaining four persons who have been executed are not Bakhtiaris. Sartip Khan and Shukrullah Khan were leaders of the Boir Ahmedi tribe in their opposition to the Government in 1930 and 1931 ; the former is referred to in the annual reports of 1930 and 1931, paragraphs 186 and 300, respectively. Hussein Khan Barehshuri was a Qashqai chief or “ kalantar.”, and Imam Quli Khan one of the ringleaders of the Mamassani tribe, for many years in opposi tion to the Government ; they both took part in the troubles in Fars in 1929 and 1930. 5. Of those sentenced to imprisonment, all of whom are Bakhtiaris, I need only mention specifically the following : Amir Jang and Amir Hussein Khan were the two Bakhtiari Deputies in the Majlis whose freedom from airest was withdrawn by vote of the Majlis last December. Both, were well-known m Tehran circles. Amir Jang was a brother of the late Minister of War, Sardar Asad ; and Amir Hussein Khan was a son of the late Sardar Zafar, K.B.E.; he was universally liked, and, until very shortly before his arrest, used to play polo with the members of the British club. Yusuf Khan Amir Mujahid has spent most of his long life in a series of intrigues, and will not be missed ; it will be remembered that he was the evil genius of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, to whom he is related bv marriage. Khan Baba Khan was another well-known Bakhtiari. who speaks English, and has a reputation for being pro-British ; he also is a brother of the late Minister of War. 6. Shahab-us-Saltaneh, now a man of about 60, has lived in seclusion at Tehran for some years ; he is a son of the late Hap Abbas g’jhut^eonsnicuous de-ribed in 1909 as “ a nleasant. well-meamn«r young man, without oonspiOTims ability.”. Muhammad Quli Khan Asad, better known as Sardar Bahadur, w another brother .of the late Minister of M-ar ; it is good to see that he is set free after his wear in prison, as he has always been a loval suppoi ter the Hovern ment, and one of the best cavalry officers that the Shah ever had. Rahim K4 Amir Balditiar is tlie son of Amir Mujahid, and is a talkative yotmg man wko received an English education at Isfaiian Of tlie other persons who were liberated the three isfamcHaris are evidently younger brothers ot bardar Iqbal, and the two Ilkhans are younger sons of the late Sardar Zafar, 7 The veil of secrecy has thus been lifted from the arrests of a year ago. Thirty six persons are now accounted for, eight being shot, twenty imprisoned, and ei°’ht set free ; all being Bakhtiaris except four of those who were shot. Nothino- has yet been revealed, however, concerning the trial or the accusations ; the court was a speciallv convened military tribunal. Having no official news whatever, 1 am dnven to make the best I can of the rumours which are circulating: with their usual rapidity. I gather from them that the fantastic story of the military stores and rifles referred to in my predecessor’s despatch No. 144 of the 23rd March, last, was not pursued, owing to a total lack of evi- dence • nor was the other still more fantastic story of a plot to kill the Shah at the Turkoman races last autumn, doubtless for the same reason. The prosecu- tior had therefore to hark back to 1S129. Now we have no documents bearing on the terms under which Samsam-us-Saltaneh and Amir Mufakham induced the dissident elements in the tribe to submit to the Government in that year, but it seems more than probable that, in that. case,, as with, the rebellious Qashqais, Mamassanis, Boir Ahmedis, etc., a safe-conduct was given to the rebels as part of tlio terms under wliicli they were induced to give themselves up to the meicy of the Government. In that case, the true lessons to be drawn from this sorry business are : first, that the Shah was determined to seize upon any pretext to punish what is perhaps, the most independent of his tribes ; secondly, that he felt more able to do so in 1934 than he did in 1929 ; and, thirdly, that no more reliance is to be placed on promises of safe-conduct given by the Pahlevi dynasty than on those given by the Qajars, or any other of Persia’s rulers. 8 Such savage sentences constitute a more severe punishment than Reza Shah has hitherto inflicted on any tribe. Viewed from a historical point of view, however, they are only another incident in the long struggle between the Central G overament and the Bakhtiaris, described from the Bakhtiari point of view in the moving pages of Layard. s Eavly jLdvcntwcs , and from a more detached standpoint by Lord Curzon (cf. especially pages 292—294 of volume II of his Persia and the Persian Question). 9 . I gather that one widely-held view is that, once the Shah had imprisoned all these 'tribesmen, he had to sentence them* for his own safety. He has cer tainly punished them all, as even the liberated ones spent about a year in prison. It must not be forgotten, however, that a few of the principal khans were never imprisoned at all, for example, Murteza Quli Khan, Sardar Muhtashim, and Amir Mufakham. , f &lt; . 10. IT is not easy to estimate the effect of the sentences. Nothing has appeared in the Persian press by way of comment, excent a formal notice bv the Tehran Isfandiary family (the head of which is Haji Mutashim-us-Saltaneh) drawing attention to* the obvious fact that they are not related to anv of the Bakhtiaris. The Bakhtiari tribe is supposed to he settling down gradually to an urban mode of life ; the registration department states that about 50 per cent, of the tribe has received civil registration documents ; and Persian Government officials a?' 0 &lt;&gt;-r*.irbiplh T assuming ^ntrol of the iudicial. fiscal, and other adminis trative activities of the tribe. However, there are still many khans left, and their memories are long. (3) (Received on 20th January 1935. with Political Reeretary’s letter No. 50, dated 3rd January 1935.)

With reference to the memorandum No. 471 of Tvr 30th, 1313 (July 21st, 1934) of the Honourable Legation regarding the search made by the customsofficials in tlie house of Latif, the ferrash of the British Vice-Consulate in Zahedan, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has the honour to state that, although a reply was given in the course of the notes Nos. 2953(32594 and 4246(40825 to the matter, further enquiries were made from the competent quarters on the receipt of H. E. Sir Reginald Hoare’s Note No. 203 of Farvardine 25th 1313 (April 14th, 1934) [Serial No. (55) in File No. 1-N.]1934]. The replies received in this connection confirm the vieAvs formerly expressed by this Ministry, namely, that the officials concerned have not perpetrated any act contrary to the stipulations of international law in taking this action. II Despatch eeom His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, to the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, No. 805, dated the 1st December 1934. His Majesty’s Legation present their compliments to the Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs and have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of their note No. 18520(1867 of November 22nd, 1934 (Azar 1st, 1313), regarding the entry of customs officials into His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate at Zahedan. 2. His Majesty’s Legation regret the Ministry’s apparent decision to leave the matter in so unsatisfactory a position and also the fact that, in placing their arguments upon the basis of international law, the Ministry appear to have misunderstood the purport of the original representations of His Majesty's Legation, in which the raising of any question of international law was inten- tioiially avoided, 3. In the United Kingdom the police would, in ordinary circumstances not seaich a piivate house, far less a foreign Consulate, without a warrant and even if they were in hot pursuit of a felon, they would not follow him into a foreign Consulate without first asking permission to enter. 4. From the plan, which was enclosed in Sir R. H. Hoare’s note No 203 of the 14th April (Farvardine 25th) last [Serial No. (203) in File No. 1-N.|34], it is clear that the house which was searched is indisputably situated within the boundaries of the Vice-Consulate, and from evidence in the possession of His Majesty’s Legation, it is equally clear that there was no question of hot pursuit. 11 may he added that as soon as the servant’s guilt was discovered, he was at once dismissed by the Vice-Consul. . V In addressing the Ministry on this subject, far from raising any question p ^^^[ndional law His Majesty’s Legation rested their arguments on the basis &lt;oi that international courtesy which is common between nations and which they had ieit convinced the Persian authorities would have appreciated.

Endorsement from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 572, dated the 28th December 1934. His Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to trans mit herewith copy of despatch No. 64, from His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman- shah, dated the 21st December, on the subject of his journey to Pusht-i-Kuh. Enclosure to Serial No. (10). Despatch from His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman shah, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 64, dated the 21st December 1934. I have the honour to report that I went yesterday by motor to Hussein- abad, formerly Deh-Bala, the capital of Pusht-i-Kuh, as the province is still always known, though its name was officially changed back to Eilam some years ago. It is, I believe, fifteen years since any of my predecessors went there, so when the Governor of Kermanshah said on the previous day that there was no objection to my going, it seemed as well to do so quickly lest he should think of one, for travel in Pusht-i-Kuh has not been encouraged in the past. 2. From Shahabad to Husseinabad is a distance of 85 miles by the road which was opened in 1932 after long and costly work ; if one could go direct the distance between those two places would be more than halved. The work doi% on the actual road and the pacification that it has made possible in a previously disturbed area is impressive. The road, on which I am sending a separate report, passes fertile valleys and very large oak forests, and also crosses two formidable ranges, through the top‘of one of which a tunnel had to be bored for a distance of some 150 yards. Heavv lorries have been using the road to carry building material to Husseinabad.* 3- T he main lorry traffic recently^ on the road has been fetching wheat for the Tehran municipality from the Shah’s estates, which now reach fromto the Renan range, a distance of 60 miles along the road. The , ' to , ok ov ® r Crown and pnrate land there these last two years, and his new stone stores for grain have been constructed in several places, the main one being at Kofrahad, 20 miles from Shahahad, at the end of the large plain iust Dei ore the Kahyah range. 4. At mile 56, on the very fertile Alvan plain, some stone houses and a model garden were in course of construction, mainly as models for the tribes men, who are being encouraged to live in houses and to cultivate a greater wariely of crops and vegetables. Similar gardens have been made at Shahabad, xlusseinabad and Mansurabad, and tbe idea is certainly sound. 5. In that large Aivan valley, through which flow the head waters of the Oangir River, that further down are a cause of friction at the Iraqi frontier, was the only village passed on the route. The tribesmen have been accustomed lo keep to their tents all through the year, and they are seen in numbers. The &lt;only tent dwellers with whom I spoke belonged to the Julak tribe, which I have not been able to identify. The burden of taxation was their main topic of con versation „ and this seemed in keeping with their correct hats. 6 . Migration is only being gradually curtailed there, and conscription has hardly been started. As has previously been reported, a large proportion of the 1 20 conscripts that were brought to Kermanshah for the first time this year from Pusht-i-Kuh managed to escape. There is no doubt, however, of the recognition in that province of the strong hand of the Central Government. Large parties of horsemen were passed, but they had no arms, and security is reported to be good, though only three small amnieh posts are stationed along this new road. 7. At Husseinabad I called on Sarhang Darakhshaul, who has been Military Governor of Pusht-i-Kuh for four years. He was transferred from regimental work in Rezaieh, and is young for his rank. Miss Preya Stark, who was the only previous European visitor he had had there, found him as friendly as I did, ibough he upset her plans. While she objected to his efforts at changing the Iribal life. I think that the common people are better off now than they were oihy five years ago under the semi-independent rule of the ignorant and cruel vali, in whose former palace I saw Sarhang Harakhshani. The burden of taxation Is probably no heavier than it used to be, and the blessing of comparative security must outweigh the main unpopularities of conscription, which Is so often evadible, and of the curtailment of long migrations, when much of Pusht-i-Kuh is habitable with good grazing throughout the year. 8 . No troops are stationed in the province. Amnieh guards attend to security and the special customs force to smuggling, hut the latter are not effective, and this is partly due to the nature of the country. Besides the demonstration farm already mentioned at Husseinabad, a large hospital is nearly completed, and if the peace is kept and some of the population who fled with the van return, the new wide street will become less deserted. 9 . A motor road to Mansurabad about 25 miles on, close to the frontier, where the Assistant Governor is stationed, will be ready next year when a bridge is finished at half the distance. The road from Qasr-i-Shirin to Mansurabad is also being worked on. Sarhang Darakhshanl appeared anxious to encourage movement over the Iraqi frontier through Mansurabad to Kut and on to Basra. 10. About recent frontier troubles, which were the subject of my despatch No. 61 of the 26th October, I did not speak much. In talking of waters which passed to Iraq, he said that as more villages were being built in Persia a larger volume was needed from the Gangir and other rivers and he seemed to ignore the fact that half the volume had been promised by Persia under the 1913 Frontier Commission, 11. To get to Husseinabad and back from here in a short winter’s day was a rush, and mv information about the road and other matters is brief, but I hope that this rapid trip will prove to have facilitated further communication with that province. 12.

The Bank’s notes in circulation which amounted to Rials 381 million at the end of Azar 1313, have increased to Rials 399 million at the end of Dey, and at the same time, the available cash in the Bank has risen from Rials 726 million at the end of Azar to Rials 742 million at the end of Dey, thus covering and guaranteeing the Bank notes issued at the rate of 186 per cent. The principal point attracting attention in the survey of the aforementioned position is the figure relative to trade bills discounted, which in the course of the last few months has speedily and regularly improved and which shows an increase from 99 million Rials at the end of Aban to 119 million Rials at the end of Azar and 136 million Rials at the end of Dey. This increase is the immediate and full result of the reductions lately allowed in discount and interest rates. The amount of debts to the Bank shows an increase of 7 million Rials, whhst a decrease of 57 million Rials appears in the amount of deposits and savings. This is due to present exigencies and does not have any relation with general conditions in the market ; moreover at the same time, the amounts due to the Bank creditors have also increased from 437 piillion Rials to 475 million Rials.! ( 12 ) {Received on 2nd March 1935, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 1, dated the 14th February 1935.) P.Z.-950|35. (Enclosure to Foreign Office covering letter No. E.-613|365|34, dated the 28th January 1935.) Despatch peom His Majesty's Ministeb, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 15-E., dated the 11th January 1935. In Sir Reginald Hoare’s despatch No. 434-E. of the 22nd September last [Serial No. (113) in File No. 1-N.|34], reference was made in paragraph 11 to the possibility of extensive smuggling of silver coins abroad following the stabilisation of the rial at a rate well below its intrinsic value. The low rate of about 80 rials to the pound, which was maintained during 1934 with a view to assist the export trade, whilst the silver value of the pound was sometimes as low as 69 rials, resulted in considerable contraband exports of the metal, and shortage of silver rials has been reported from various districts. Towards the end of December the National Bank reduced the rate, which had touched 82 rials, to 76 rials to the pound within a few days. The following extract from the December diary of His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah is of interest in this connexion :— “ Till the rate was lowered towards the end of the month the tempta tion to smuggle silver out of Persia was great and local stocks became very short. For some while the National Bank paid out no metal except damaged silver or nickel. Yet, the fear of the authorities was sufficient to prevent any signs of a run on that bank. Confidence in the notes naturally has decreased. At Qasr-i-Shirin they were quoted at a 12 per cent, discount on silver, but no one ventured to quote a rate publicly here.' 2. The commerical secretary was informed that towards the end of Decem ber, before the rate of exchange was reduced, smuggled silver from Persia was arriving at Baghdad at the rate of 1 million rials (£12,500) per week. No doubt the same thing was happening over other frontiers, and probably a fair amount was going to India either direct or through Afghanistan. Even with the rate of 76 rials to the pound, it is probably still profitable, but the fact that the rate has remained at that figure may mean that a check, perhaps only temporary, has been effected on these illicit exports. 3. I am told that, since the change in the rates, the National Bank are refusing to sell forward foreign exchange. This tends to confirm the view that the bank are not likely to raise the rial to a higher exchange value, and that as soon as they can conveniently do so they will mark it down again. Possibly, in the meantime, they may take steps to “ attract ” as many silver coins into their coffers as possible, but it is doubtful whether this measure would have any real success. 4. The proposal of the National Bank, reported in my despatch No. 517-E. of the 27th November last, for the adoption of the gold standard by Persia, seems unlikely to be accepted in the near futuie, and I was told a few weeks ago that it had been rejected bv the Council of Ministers. There are already rumours vffiich in the circumstances are not surprising, that the authorities intend at an early date to debase the coinage by reducing the silver content of the rial by one-half. 5 In view of these problems, the position of Colonel Khosrovi, the Persian director of the National Bank, is no sinecure, and it remains to be seen whether he can maintain it with the rather slender technical experience at his command. If he brings the rial rate approximately to silver point he could probaby stop the smuggling and hoarding of silver, hut at the cost of inflicting an impossible burden on the export trade. If he depreciates the value of the ml, or attempts to debase the coinage, large amounts of silver will certainly be lost. The pre sent situation is not satisfactory, and can hardly tie maintained indefinite y. It is possible that a way out may be found, but it is also concenj.bu that h Persian authorities may already be regretting their light-hearted disimssal last year of an experienced manager of the National Bank m the person of Heir Horschitz Horst. 1S20SFD14 6 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade [No. 0. T. (B)-5 |, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, and His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 2). I have, etc., H. M. KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN. (13) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 94-E., dated the 23rd February 1935. I have the honour to report that, according to a report contained in the Com mercial Diary for January of His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz, a company to be known as Shirkat-i-Tijareti is to be formed for the purpose of “ assisting the economic conditions of Fars and of the ports of the Persian Gulf and to secure better markets for the products of the country ”. The capital of the company is to be eight million rials (about one hundred thousand pounds), of which five million six-hundred thousand rials will be supplied by the State- owned Agricultural Bank, the remainder being available for public subscrip tion. The concern, it is reported, will take over the import trade of the pro vince of Fars, with the exception of that in products already^ monopolised or entrusted to separate concerns will probably obtain preferential treatment in applications for import licences, and will undertake general export business. 2. In addition to this Company, His Majesty’s Consul reports that it is intended to form (a) a company with a capital of eight hundred thousand rials to take over the business in sugar and matches for the province ; (b) a company with a capital of one million rials, of which eight hundred thousand will be supplied by the Government, to take over the export trade in raw cotton ; (e) a company with a capital of one million rials, of which nine hundred and fifty thousand rials will be supplied by the Government, for the export of wheat and barley. 3 . It will be observed that when these companies are all actively func tioning, there will be little if any room left for the activity of individual traders. 4. The formation of these companies with Government support or parti cipation in the province of Fars is by no means an isolated development. The announcement of the change followed the visit to Shiraz of the Minister of Finance, who has actively encouraged these new schemes. Following the visit of this Minister to Khorasan in December it was announced that a company was to be formed with a capital of ten million rials (about one hundred and twenty- five thousand pounds) of which only twm and a half million rials were to be furnished by merchants, the remainder being provided by the Agricultural Bank at Meshed. The exact nature of the activities of the new Company was not stated in the press, but it will probably work on lines similar to the Shiraz company. 5. At Hamadan a trading company is to be established with a capital of on million two hundred thousand rials. His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz re cently reported a project to establish an export monopoly for the better market ing of dried fruits, in order to provide a more efficient bargaining force with the Russians, who are becoming very important buyers of this commodity. 6 . Furtder developments in the same direction are certain to materialise in other parts of the country, particularly if the Minister of Finance extends his tours. The formation of large groups of merchants to deal with import and export trade in the provinces is not, perhaps, of itself a bad thing, parti cularly if it enables the provincial cities to continue to function as trading centres instead of seeing all their activities transferred to the capital. But the increasing financial participation of the Government, through the Agricultural Bank, in the new ventures is not an encouraging factor, and seems likely to lead to further restrictions detrimental to the successful conduct of trading rela tions. 7.

(15) Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London* No. 99, dated the 4-th March 1935. I have the honour to transmit, herewith, a copy of a report which has been drawn up by His Majesty’s Consul in the absence of the Military Attache, on the review which was held here on February 22nd, the fourteenth anniversary* of the coup d’etat of the 3rd Hout, 1299. 2. The review was certainly impressive. A contributing factor was un doubtedly the large number of men on parade but, apart from this, foreign observers were struck by the smartness of the troops and those who had seen many similar reviews in the past were agreed that not merely did the present one display an enormous advance over those held eight or nine years ago, but that it represented a considerable improvement even over the review of 1931. 3. The ceremony was spoilt to a certain client by bad weather. Clouds were low all day and before the end of the afternoon it came on to rain heavity. In consequence the aeroplanes must have had a rough passage and two of them were, in fact, obliged to make forced landings. It is worth noting that the pilots of the four Hawker machines which gave what seemed rather an elemen tary display of acrobatics were not Persians but members of the Be gmn mission. Nevertheless, it must be regarded as a distinct feat On the part ot the Persians to have put so many machines in the air at the same time. 4. The Shah remained out in the rain until the very end, though by with drawing no more than a pace or two he could have taken shelter under the covered verandah of his pavilion. He appeared to be m excellent humour and, judging bv his gestures and the number of orders which he gave to his aides de Samp, seemed to be taking the liveliest interest m even the smallest point of detail The Cabinet, who were also obliged to stand out m the ram,_ looked less happy. The Corps Diplomatique were accommodated m a special tent next thFsalnlinv base from which they had an excellent view of the proy e ' Lgs. Despite their close proximity to the Shah, however, His Majesty did not&amp;ake so much as the slightest sign from beginning to end which showed that he recognised their presence, 5 .

His Imperial Majesty the Shah held a review of troops at Tehran cm the 22nd February, 1935, on the Jalalieh parade ground. For the first time since the review of 1931 invitations to attend were issued to the Heads of Diplomatic Missions and their staffs, who were accommodated in a tent set aside for them. Invitations were also issued to a limited number of other guests, foreign as well as Persian. His Imperial Majesty arrived at 2-15 p.m. but did not drive up the parade ground. He approached from a point outside the ground and mounted his charger and, accompanied bv his senior staff officers, rode past the parade at some dis tance from the saluting base to which he subsequently returned and took up Ins position below the Imperial standard. He did not receive either Heads of Missions or the foreign Military Attaches. At 3 p.m. a detachment of some 300 hoy scouts, led by the American scout master in charge, paraded before His Majesty and sang a paean of praise. This was followed by bayonet exercises carried out by a detachment of the Pahelvi guards. The exercises were carried out with admirable precision. There followed a squad of gymnasts dressed in the colours of the national fl a o- red, green and white—^who composed a set piece in the above colours forming a semblance of the PahlevI crown. The effect was excellent and the movements were well carried out.

I have the honour to inform you that the Oriental Secretary to His Majesty’s Legation recently had an interesting conversation with Prince Nusrat-es-Saltaneh, who treated him to a long disquisition on the present state of affairs in Iran. 2'. The Prince took a very gloomy view of the situation and spoke with especial pessism about the plight of the peasants. The latter, he said, had no money and were unable to buy sugar, tea or clothes. They were all in debt and had in fact never been in a worse state than they were to-day. 3. The administration of the country, the Prince continued, was in a state of appalling inefficiency. As an instance he cited an experience of his own when it had taken him six months to clear from the customs a packet of pills which he had had sent from Paris and for which he had already obtained an import permit. He had mentioned this experience to Bahman, the head of the Department of Commerce, but the latter had only launched off into a long panegyric on the marvellous state of Iran in general and its commerce in par ticular. 4. The Prince had no complaint to make about the Shah. On the contrary he described him as a marvellous and excellent ruler. But his advisers were only concerned with keeping their places and nothing was really brought to his notice about the true situation of the peasants. (As an illustration of the Prince’s remarks about the Shah’s advisers, the enclosed extract from the 44 Messager de Teheran ” giving the text of a speech delivered by the Pre sident of the Majlis on the occasion of His Majesty’s birthday is of some in terest. I venture to think that even in present day Iran such a display of public adulation is unusual.) 5. Reverting to his earlier theme, the Prince said that the peasants consti tuted an important part of the nation. They were not at the moment Bolshevik in outlook but the state of misery in which they existed was likely'to afford the best possible ground for the dissemination of Bolshevik ideas. The situation in some respects reminded him uncomfortably of the last days of the Tsarist regime in Russia. 6. The Prince’s remarks about the peasantry are confirmed by Monsieur Naimy, the head munshi to His Majesty’s Legation, who has recently been in Mazanderan and Gilan. In Resht he said that he had found swarms of beggars, where previously there had been hardly any. Monsieur Naimy al^o observed that there was a good deal of building activity in Maz-anderan, where houses were being erected that seemed to be designed as model dwellings for peasants. The system is that the peasants themselves provide the labour, the wood is ready at hand and costs nothing and the only real charge is provided by tne wao’es of the more or less expert builders. The cottages when built are appar ently let for the profit of the Imperial Exchequer. The Shah is understood to have got the idea from some workmen’s cottages which he saw 111 Turkey and the official who is in charge of the work is seemingly* General Ayrom, the Chief of Police. 7 1 can myself testify to the wretched conditions of the populations of such towns and villages as I have passed through m Iran. The lack of cloth- ing is particularly noticeable. 8 Some days ago I was much struck at hearing from Monsieur Soheio, in his own office at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs a similar depressing view of thn situation Monsieur Soheilv m somewhai guarded language d^.'i the expenditure ‘on.factories and railways and agreed with me that attention should first have Been devoted to improving agriculture and ■ conditions in the pro- vinces. Ho also agreed with the impression which I formed m tne Sou.a, namely, that trade and enterprise were being killed by taxation an le rac e Monopoly Law. 9. I am sending a copy of this despatch, with its enclosure, to the Foieign Secretary to the Government of India (i o, oj. LS208FDEnclosure to Serial No. (23). Memorandum respecting the Internal Affairs of Persia. Before going- on leave I find myself reflecting on the progress made bv eisia m the twenty-one months since my arrival. I am confining my remarks to internal aft airs, and not attempting comment on the Shah’s recent conduct of foreign affairs. ' The Shah is probably no more popular than two years ae;o but he is feared and respected. Oriental despots are never loved, and do not Lpm to be. As an oriental despot the Shah is probably above the average in benevolence to the people at large, and the news of his Turkish tour, well advertised all over over Persia, has, I think, enhanced his prestige with his people Thev Ire nware of Ins land and money-grabbing propensity, but that is not a new eharac- teustic among Persian noblemen; they are painfully aware of heavy taxation- - iG y?. ie P 10 ^bly less interested in the safety on the highways, which is one of the things winch most strikes an European. But the Persians are, I believe proud of what Reza has done for them, and feel that he has raised the respect for the country abroad now that they see the formerly privileged foreigners treated as themselves. . The creation of a Persian navy is one of his °most admired acts, and I ersians are proud of it quite beyond its actual importance because it is a symbol of the Shah’s assertion of rights in the Persian Gulf Among the upper classes there is a feeling of pride, which in most cases turns easily to insolence ; they criticise the Shah a good deal sotto voce among them selves, but to a foreigner they wifi sing his praises and their own. If he lives long enough he will become a kind of legendary figure in his own lifetime and he may die popular. Nobody can criticise him for personal ostentation or extravagance ; he leads a laborious life, free from any of the lighter distrac- tions or grosser vices which characterised the Qajars ; he never hardly shows himself in public except to his army ; he has no time for hunting or riding ; he travels from town to town rapidly and unexpectedly to the terror of less &amp; com petent provincial officials, issues his orders and is gone. His one amusement is the annual visit to the Turkoman races. Yet in spite of this Spartan habit of life he. is fai fiom democratic, and does not demean himself to conversations with his poorer subjects, while, with the richer ones, interviews are apt to con sist of monologues of a minatory and didactic nature. Such are his weekly parades of the Members of Parliament, and I fancy that those of the Council *)f Ministers are conducted on similar lines. The Shah has forced Persians to worx together instead Of playing at party politics, intriguing and quarrelling as their habit was and as their nature would still impel them to do but for fear of him. In the spring of 1933 people were fresh from the shock of Teymour- tache’s arrest, and were wondering how the Shah would manage without this intimate counsellor. We now know the answer, which is that he tries to do everything himself. H&gt; trusts Feroughi and, we believe, Ayrom. How far Ayrom ever dares speak to him on political as opposed to police and military and business matters is not known. We may be sure from our knowledge of Feroughi’s character that he never argues or speaks up in any matter which might land him in any sort of bother. He wants a quiet life, in contrast to Teymourtaehe, who hated one. So there is nobody who can be trusted to speak his mind or even to repeat unpalatable truths to His Majesty, and as a result the Shah’s character is deteriorating. He is becoming more and more suscep tible to flattery and more sensitive to newspaper criticism. He suffers, like all his race, from an overwhelming inferiority complex, and his loneliness and lack of friends or counsellors Is increasing the complex. He only feels happy and at home among his soldiers ; he also knows that they are the Praetorian Ouard on whom his existence and the continuation of his dynasty depends. They have been largely augmented in the last two years by conscription, and probably now number about 100,000. The army absorbs more than half the revenues of the country and is pampered In everything. A big proportion lies always ready to the Shah’s hand all around the caoital, where new barracks seem to spring up almost overnight in the desert. The whole air force of over fifty machines is concentrated at Tehran. As long as the troops remain loyal the dynastv is safe. But what will a schemes like General Ayrom do when the Shah is dead ? T believe that the material progress recently is proceeding very much ahead of intellectual or moral progress, and that therein lies a great problem of die future. Can a nation survive If she casts off all that is best along win all thatis worst in the traditions of the past ? Material progress is evident from the ra^id extension of the railway up the mountain side towards fnruzkuh ; the oneniim of the Chains road to Mazanderan, both ot them great engmeemig feats te winch tne help of foreign experts has been suecessiully _ utihged.,, Ik,ad conMruction in other parts of Persia has been going ahead, altnoiigii less rapidly wnen away from the capital, the most important new artery ^ PF^y tae road ioining Tabriz with Rowanduz and Mosul. The bhah s visit to lurhey by road irom Tabriz to Trebizond wifi probably bear fruit m the near future m tar improvement in that line of communications A direct road irom Resht to Tabriz is heimr mvshed through. A new road is to be built trom Tehran to Amol in Mazanderan. via Pelur in the Lar Valley. Thus it is apparent that the maximum effort is being concentrated on provrding^M outl^ alterna ve to charcoal. Fisa, altaougn tne orggcbi ’ . the Russian monopoly precludes their being exported anywhere except to and through Russia. In considering this question of the opening up of the coastal pioviiices, one salient fact must not be lost sight of, namely, that the Shah owns the whole of Mazanderan and Tunekabun and part of Gilan, and tnat his properties are rouidlv being augmented. For instance, he has recently acquired the land round Amol, hence the projected new road The Shah is extremely proud, and hates the idea that lie. as a landlord as well as King, is economically in the clutches of the Soviet Government. He is looking everywhere for a bolt hole- Turkov Iraq, Persian Gulf. This motive, combined with that of prestige, makes*the completion of the Trans-Persian Railway during his lifetime a fetish for him The big price to be paid for the railway (£24 million) and the roads w 8 i.d“s nothing^igainst the idea that, in the end, he will have freed his country and the personal property of his family from the position of a hostage m tee hands of the hated Russians. Economic and financial wisdom must, if need be, remain subordinate to political expediency. ^ - So much for the development of communications ; the complement of the plan requires industrial development on a scale to render the country nide- pendent of imports in respect, of the necessities of life. _ Raw material ahead lies to hand for the silk, cement, sugar, cotton, and ]ute industries. Coal exists in maitv of the mountains, oil is abundant. These latter must be developed ; hence the anxiety with which the Shah has insisted on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company opening up the new field at Kasr-i-Snirm and refiner} ai Iveiman- shah ; hence the vast expenditure involved in boring the Shemshak road through the mountains and building a powder station, offices, workmen ndweilmg, yc.,n the Government coal mines at Shemshak, about 40 imle&amp;ffir.om the capital. Iheie ia a danger that the sudden mania for industrialisation may lead to over-produc tion quite soon, and that the surplus products of industry-wall not he exportable except at a loss ; the danger is the greater owing to the very low standard^ living, which excessive taxation forces upon even, the richer Persians, and tne stagnation which reigns increasingly in the baxaars, especially in the provinces. The last twenty-one months have also witnessed a good deal of municipal progress - the streets of Tehran are being paved with granite blocks at great expense, but to the vast improvement of the town’s amenities ; new buildings are being rushed up iu anticipation of a visit from the Turkish Gazi. grout) of buildings round the Bagh-i-Milli, which include a vaet police^station, significant of the power of General Ayrom, and a museum, will be quite liana some addition to the town ; the new- National Bank premises,- m the style oi Persepolis, look promising. Gradually Tehran is assuming the aspect ot a civi lised town though it will never be what the Persians think—a rival m beatin and modern!tv to the great cities of Europe. In the provincial centres progress is being made, and new T squares, electrically illtimmated, are taking L - place of slums. The sad thing is that the money is all spent on show : not oiw town has a decently drinkable water supply, nor is public hygiene_carried muef bevond the destruction of the more obviously distressing rubbish in the streeis- Slums, as stated above, are being destroyed, but the poor are not having ten-- ments put up for them, and are, instead, merely being huddled together into slums that remain. * 4 f the Irrigation is being neglected instead of being treated as the nrst °t u country’s needs ; there is ample scope, as an Italian engineer with lone ^ Ran experience told me, for water storage enough to increase beyond anw ^ is iribes wWch p'cod^ice ^lie finest^vool 0 ''' j' 3e * n ® made to settle the 'se^i-n^adi; feelini- tlie ohieh f ,' a A mto P e ™Meat villages.

Wheii ihf Shah felt strong enough he struck, and the result was the recent condemnations. The KaJigai tube also seem broken. A big tribal rising seems less likely now than lit any time in Koza s reign ; he has probably destroyed the feudal system though his early death might lead to a final Hare-up. There will, no doubt be occasional acts of brigandage and ambushes of troops. Religious fanaticism still exists in the villages, and I do not believe that the anti-religious forces have made much advance lately ; Ramazan is still observed fairly strictly, in outward form at least, in Tehran, and completely in the country districts. Even the Shah’s presence in Meshed did not suffice to throw open the gates of the shrine of Imam Reza to the learned men of the Eerdousi congress, although it had been put about beforehand that they would '^it the shrine and its famous library. On the other hand, the secularisation ot education seems to he making progress ; all non-Moslem schools, Christian, Jewish and Bahai, have to conform to the rules of the Ministry of Education, and failure to do so has caused the closure of the Bahai schools. All foreign schools have had to adopt Persian names. This brings me naturally to the subject of education, and here, I think, progress must be recorded, and the number of hoys and girls attending school is rapidly increasing. I was interested to see children from the black tent dwellers in the Ear Valley plodding several miles to school in another tent “ village ” last summer. The standard is probably low enough, but the number of at least partial literates in the next generation will he several hundredfold that of the present adult literate population. Among the upper and middle classes the large number of boys educated abroad are returning and making themselves felt. The administration of justice under Davar undoubtedly made great strides : the impetus has since somewhat slowed down. There are still failures to keep the practice up to the standard set by theory, and in the Parsons case we put our finger upon a serious lapse. Other trials in which foreigners have been involved include the Lindenblatt trial, which was fairly conducted, and the Mesopotamia-Persia Corporation’s case against Kazernni, in which, after a good deal of anxiety, the company had justice done them. Political trials of Persians could, no doubt, he criticised if the evidence were published, hut, as they are conducted by court-martial and in camera, we do not know whether there is any attempt at justice. Teymourtache, Diba, the Bakhtiari Khans, and others, have been condemned by such courts in the last few months. It is not a system of which English people can approve,, but it is quite civilised compared with recent German methods of dealing with political opponents. Finance is a subject on which I hesitate to he dogmatic. There seems to he plenty of money available for every kind of extravagance, but all of the reserves represented by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company £4 million windfall and the foreign exchange accumulations have been spent. There is a fantastic, gold cover for the note issue, but the tempting course of printing new notes is now being favoured and, if continued long enough, will lead to inflation and a fail of the rial ; perhaps if such a fall could be kept within manageable limits fRO would be all to the good for the country’s trade. The lial, which has nppiccmT ed in value by almost 25 per cent, in the last twenty-one months, now stands so LS208FDWfFQ MiJP |lj a t Persian products are difficult to export. The Shah s confidence i,t Colonel Aniir Khosrovi, the manager of the National Bank, is leading that rather amateur banker to interfere in trading matters more and more, to the, embarrassment of the Minister of Finance. The bank seems to aspire to func tions outside its scope and may well be heading for a crash. Exports are, in fact, becoming more and more the problem of the hour. How can they be stimulated f Carpets are selling very badly ; rice is subject to the whims of Russia ; other products, always excepting oil, which does not i n the Persian trade balance statistics, are almost unsaleable .Moreover the more Persia becomes self-sufficing by manufacturing its own cotton, silk and other ooods. the less she will buy abroad, so that foreign trade will com- almost to a standstill, except for the motor trade and big orders of machinery tor Government purposes. I cannot help feeling that Persia is much nearer a serious financial crisis than when 1 arrived, and that before many months she will have to resort to some sort of foreign financial assistance. The taxable limit must almost have been reached now that income tax is being levied on incomes as small as to a vear, incomes which are already having to hear the burden of the sugar and tea monopoly taxes, which amount, with road tax and freights, to about 600 per cent. a ,I ralorevt. In fact, it is doubtful whether the poor in Persia have ever seen worse off. Travellers from Iraq always remark on the poverty they meet after crossing the frontier, and even in Tehran one cannot help being strucx by the beggars and the astonishing rags in which they are clothed. Tne only rich people, comparatively speaking, are the army of all ranks They have great scope for oppression and corruption, and from all accounts tney maxe the mos, of their opportunities. So much for material and visible progress ; moral progress is more difficult to measure, but such as is being achieved is probably chieth in the , (k emancipation and education of women. Polygamy has been practically knleti bv economic stringency and, with its disappearance and greater rengions lax it \, there seems to be little doubt that prostitution has grown a good deal. iue Afghan Ambassador, not himself considered in Persian eyes to be a paragon ot virtue, tells me that be is greatly shocked at the rapid increase of open soliciting in the streets of the town, and that he considers that the women here hare no morals at all. There is certainly no longer any of the Moslem secrecy about such matters. Truth-telling has never been a strong point of the Persians and I have observed no signs of am* improvement in this direction. Boastfulness is on the increase, and arrogance born of an idea that Persia has very little more to learn from the West makes itself felt daily more and more. Corruption is rife in spite of the Shah’s genuine efforts to suppress it, and the high customs duties make smuggling and the bribery connected therewith universal. The police are said to be venal to the last degree. Patriotism might be supposed to be the great feature of modern Persia, but 1 doubt whether it is real patriotism which dictates such nonsensical outbursts of nationalism as the order to foreigners to call Persia “ Iran.” I also doubt whether there are many Persians who would not be prepared for a large enough sum to sell their country, provided they could he sure of not being found out. Formerly, the Persians excelled in a critical sense and were not slow to exercise it ; now thev dare not. because all liberty of speech and writing is suppressed. I, do not suggest that matters have got worse just lately, but -he tendency is in that direction because of the terror caused by the disgrace ot Teymourtache. As for the old “ constitutional ” movement which led to th- creation of Parliament, it seems that everybody is reconciled to the idea that democracy does not work here and that liberty, after the revolution ot i^uo, merely degenerated into licence. Good manners and formal politeness have gone with the disappearance of religious forms and only linger among the poorer classes and provincials. Nevertheless, the Persians of good family, who are not in Government einpio&gt;- ment and thereby constrained to show foreigners that they are no better mai auvone else, are still very charming in their social relations and hospitable &lt; generous if onlv they dare risk meeting foreigners. The Persians are naT • nature xenophobe and they enjoy European society. The present ban * them.47 r \ (24) s: fa =9 s ; rc,,it sajRfnafew l™t° U S1X ed and thirty th0USand nine hundred a » d 'two 2 The total quantity of gold now held by the National Bank is stated to he twenty million eight hundred and ninety thousand nine hundred and eio-htv- seven grammes. On a basis of thirty-one point nought three-five grammes to. the fine ounce, this quantity represents a value, at seven pounds sterling per line ounce, ot about four million seven hundred thousand pounds sterling. If the present ruling price of about one hundred and forty-seven shillings an ounce is taken as the basis, the value would be approximately four million nm a hundred and thirty-six thousand pounds sterling. 3. The latest available figures prior to those reported above were con tained in the Bulletin of the National Bank of Persia for December 1934. These showed a total gold stock (including forty-four thousand three hundred and sixty-five grammes held abroad) of seventeen million nine hundred and forty-nine thousand six hundred and nineteen grammes on October 10 th, 1934. It appears, therefore, that in addition to the two million six hundred and’thirty thousand nine hundred and ninety-two grammes recently acquired from abroad, a further quantity of three hundred and ten thousand three hundred and seventy-six grammes has been purchased, presumably within Persia. 4.

Enclosure to Serial No. (24-A). Summary of Events and Conditions in Fars during the year 1934. (Confidential.) Situation. _ , ' The situation has remained undisturbed and progress has continued in the pacification and development of the province. 2 Tribal With the exception of a few isolated cases of “ brigandage ” by tribesmen in the more remote districts, no further difficulties were experienced after the surrender and removal to the capital of AH Khan Qashqar last year An example was given to the tribesmen bv executions m _Sbiraz of a few robber leSs aTd in Tehran, this winter, of some of the minor unruly leaders, mainly from the MamassanL .The disciplinary administration imposed upon the tribes by the military Governors appointed by the General Officer Commanding, Ears Brigade, with the extension of the Amnieh stations and blockhouses and the lack of ambition and of local influence of the young hereditary chieftains, who are also under constant supervision, have contributed to the policy of the breaking-up of the tribes as a unit. The tribal svstem has been further attacked by the law enacted for the forthcoming elections to the Majlis. Under this the special ballot boxes hitherto issued for the tribal vote are done away with and votes are to be recorded at prescribed centres, together with those of the settled inhabitants. It is stated that Government intends, within the next two years, to com plete the permanent settlement of the tribes in defined areas and to abolish the annual migrations. An official was at Shiraz during the year to prepare a report on the subject for the Shah. The principal difficulty will lie in the allocation of suitable watering and grazing grounds. The new town of Tal-i-Khosrau, 40 miles to the north-east of Ardekan, has risen as part of this policy. 3. Security. Public security was good, reports of attacks upon lorries on or near the main roads having mostly proved exaggerated. There were a small number of highway robberies in distant districts, in one of which the Director of the Roads Department was robbed of 30,000 rials. 4. Governorate-General. His Excellency Mirza Majid Khan Ahy, who took over the duties of Gov ernor General in September 1933, has shown himself a capable and conciliatory official and has continued to be helpful to His Majesty’s Consul. &gt;5. Attitude to Foreigners. The instructions of the central authorities prohibiting all officials, with the exception of the Chief of Police, from having any relations with foreign repre sentatives, were rigidly observed. The prohibition has been extended to leading notables, merchants and others, some of those who appeared at the con sulate on their business being subsequently called upon by the police to explain their visit. The officials are suffering from spy mania. National sensibility perhaps intolerance, cultivated by the press of the capital at certain seasons, finds a rich ground in Ears, where British officials have commanded considerable influence in the past, whilst it is difficult for the present generation to forget the formation and maintenance here of the South Persia Rifles. These conditions have led to the otherwise inexplicable treatment of Mr. Christopher Sykes, who arrived in Shiraz in February on a tour of the province. He was not only refused permission to visit Firuzabad, but requested not to leave the town, being eventually permitted to proceed to Bushire upon the condition that he then quitted the country. The order was subsequently rescinded on official into rvention. The Dominican Fathers, the Rev. Dominic Blencowe, O.P., and the Rev. Cyprian Rice, O.P., who arrived at Shiraz in 1933 with the object of founding a Dominican monastery, also came under the ban, owing to their British nationality and to the fact that Father Rice had been a member of His Majesty’s Consular Service. The authorities convinced themselves that Father Rice had served as a subaltern in the South Persia Rifles. These conditions, coupled with the inability of the authorities to understand the work of the fathers and the poor health of Father Blencowe, eventually led to their withdrawal and the closing down of the monastery. An Armenian priest, educated in Rome, has since been stationed here, as a successor, by the Apostolic Delegate at Tehran. Orders were received by the Judicial Department during the year prohibit ing the use of all foreign words and phrases in legal documents and corres pondence. 6. Military. The Ears Brigade is to acquire divisional status by the formation of a third infantry regiment and the increase of the cavalry to regimental strength. AVork has been proceeding at the Bagh-i-Takht barracks, to the north of the town, to double the accommodation available for the Infantry and Artillery.3\ T ew barracks to bouse the Cavalry Regiment ina sou ill of the town, on the Bushire road, sheds at the aerodrome is under construction visited Shiraz in June. are being put up, about 1 mile to The construction of aeroplane and a h'rench aviation adviser The troops at Shiraz are receiving regular training and the appearance of officers and men is good. Sartip Ibrahim Khan Zandieh is General Officer Commanding. 7. Amnieh. The Southern Amnieh (Road Guards) Command in the Province of Pars was abolished in August, when the force in the area became the 8 th Shiraz Regiment of Amnieh. The 19th Regiment of Amnieh of Pars was moved to Laristan in March. The discipline and conduct of the road guards has shown improvement, although complaints of the exactions of some of the men in the remoter areas are heard from time to time. fs. Communications. A new road between Shiraz and Tal-i-Khosrau was opened in the early part of the year and repaired after the spring rains. A road from Shiraz to Bandar-i-Lingeh, via Jahrnm, Bar and Bastak, was reported to be nearing completion in the late summer. No further progress has been made on the new Shiraz-Firuzabad road, which reaches up to Pol-i-Fasa. The approach to the Qoran Gate entrance of the town (Isfahan-Shiraz road) was widened to permit of two vehicles passing each other. A new avenue, to cut through the town of Shiraz from west to east, was begun towards the end of the year. A telegraph instrument was set up at Dehbid in September. The Shiraz-Bushire road was closed to traffic for short periods from Janu- nry to March owing to heavy rains and snow. Snow on the heights at Dehbid stopped passage on the Shiraz-Isfahan road in February. 9. Irrigation. .. . f , , , An attempt was made to increase the water supplies of the town and dis trict of Shiraz, with the expert advice of Dr. Lepmann, a German civil engineer. The latter had not obtained a contract by the end of the year, and resigned. A project to improve irrigation in the Ramjerd area, by the construction of a more solid barrage for the waters of the Band-i-Amir, was being con sidered. - 1 ' ■ 1 ' 10. Economic ^Conditions. The economie condition of the province has been had owing to the tightness of money, the restrictions upon trade and the drain of taxation, which has proved a heavy burden npon all classes. Many merchants attribute this state to the large sums sunk annually in the armed forces and in the building of the railway, a policy which withdraws a large part of the liquid assets of the country from circulation, without pro- ductive result. Fond if ions locallv were further aggravated in the early part of the year by the failure o? two of the leading sarraf, on the top of the failure of Seyyed Abdul Rasul Kazauruni. The bazaar was very ruptcies followed. The banks were compelled to come to the assistance ot ome sarraf to strengthen the market. . . ,, r A branch of the Agricultural Bank was opened m Shiraz m the month of Mav to assist growers. . . ? ’ The Agricultural Department took measures to promote the cultivation of cotton and beetroot. \l. Cotton Spinning Mill. . . ,_ indleg machinery by Platt The Shiraz Cotton Spinning Mi o ’ . F. b ’ t i 10 General Electric and Co. of Oldham, motor and e ec ; ^ t which two power engines bv •Company and Metropolitan Vickeis (Limited), 1LS208FS50 Mirelees are to be added shortly, began work in May 1934, under a British mill manager. M. Hussein Agar (’Etemad-ul-Tujar), formerly a merchant of Manchester, is the chairman of the board of directors and the moving spirit in the venture. The output of the mill was quickly disposed of for several months in advance. The undertaking has proved so profitable that it is proposed to increase the number of spindles. Full output has been handicapped by the lack of suitable labour. The construction of a second mill was being seriously considered at the end of the year by the Dehkan Brothers. 12. Sugar Refinery. The promise of Government to endow this province with a sugar factory materialised in the summer, when work upon the buildings started on a site at Marvdasht, near the waters of the Band-i-Amir, on the Shiraz-Persepolis road. In the autumn it was found that the Agricultural Department was unable to complete the building owing to the incompetence, etc., ot the officials and a contract for the work was given to Swedish public works contractors in the capital. The machinery is to be supplied by the Skoda oiks, and is due in the spring, via the Caspian. The contract provided for despatch via Bushire, but it was found that some of the parts were too heavy and too bulky for road transport from that port. The prospects of this factory are dependent upon the successful growing of the beetroot in the province, a cultivation upon which there is little practical experience and knowledge at the present. The actual cost of production is estimated to be from 200 per cent, to 300 per cent, greater than the price at which sugar of continental manufacture can be offered ci.f. Bushire. 13. Trade. The import trade of Shiraz was stagnant throughout the year owing to the restrictions governing commerce and the fears of the further monopolisa tion (or the farming-out to groups of merchants in the capital) of the import of other commodities. The decision of Government to develop the port of Band-i-Shahpur and the Ahwaz-Mohammerah routes to the north at the expense of the port of Bushire and the route via Shiraz became apparent in the allocation of the customs im port quotas. It is realised that if the project can be carried through the of Bushire will serve solely to feed Shiraz and the district, whilst the Isfahan and other northern markets will be lost. Japanese piece-goods succeeded in wresting the premier position from the Soviets. Merchants have been very dissatisfied with the business methods of both countries in reducing quotations immediately upon the sale of a large con signment. The Japanese manufacturer has secured the market for other commodities. A quotation for the supply of electric light bulbs at 80 per cent, below the price of those of British and continental make was received by the Fars Electric Lighting Company. The export market has seen better conditions with sales of skins and gums. Prices ruling for lambskins in London at the end of the year have made further shipments impossible, hut the Bussians have continued to purchase steadily throughout the year. Good quantities of gum fragacanth have gone forward to London, American, Russian and other European markets, and Japanese purchases to wards the end of the yoar gave a strong tone to the market. The opium trade was mostlv dull, until the svndicate formed in the capital made substantial purchases. The abolition of the “ hazzari ” (mononolv department control of ground under cultivation and estimate of production) and the undertaking hv the department to purchase all properly prepared quan tities next year have led to increased sowings in the province. Towards the end of the vear exports o^ almonds to India were despatched *'ia Zahedan and the Indian Railwavs. Arrivals of tea for the Shiraz and Isfahan markets hv this route have been reported since August. The opening up of this route is attributed tq the deerease in the railway transport charges.14. Soviet Activities. rho activities of the Soviets in the province during the year appear to have been limited to their trading organisation. Merchants who had been persuaded in the past to subscribe to the Russian Bank and who had tiled to obtain a refund of their investment were informed that the application must be made in person in Moscow. The Soviets Trading Agency continued to make local purchases of all sorts during the year. Merchants claim that the Russia* handling of lambskins will lead to the loss of the Shiraz lambskin trade in Rurope, as tire skins are sorted for resale in Russia and only the lower qualities described as Persian. The higher grades are labelled as Bookhara and Afghan skins. 15. Ferdausi Celebrations. ' The Ferdausi celebrations were held at Shiraz from the 6 th to 12th October, when the Governor-General opened a new boys’ school and referred to the pros pect of the opening of a public library. The funds for these receptions, exhibitions, etc., were obtained by a form of public levy upon merchants, shopkeepers, Government officials, etc., and a house-to-house collection. Several of the official guests to the Tehran-Meshed-Taus celebrations, including Mr. John Drinkwater, passed through Shiraz, after visiting Persepolis, on their return. 16. Surveys. The geological survey by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited) of the Shiraz- Jahrum-Niriz-Kazerun areas was completed in the autumn. Dr. K. Washington Gray and his assistants have returned to Abadan. 17. Archaeological. Sir Aurel Stein, K.C.I.E., who had arrived in November 1933 for an ex tended but rapid examination of prehistoric mounds in the southern and eastern areas of this province, completed his-explorations and left for London in May Permission to visit the Lar and Darab areas was eventually obtained for him through the Governor-General, who succeeded in persuading the mili tary authorities to withdraw their objections. Difficulties which threatened further work at Persepolis by the present mission under Professor Herzfeld arose during the year between the Persian Government and the representatives of the Oriental Institute of Clncag . Good progress towards a settlement of the points at issue was reported to have been made towards the end of the year, after a division of the finds tor which M. Goddard represented the Government. 18. Consulates (British consulate omitted). . M Pierre Tchougounov assumed charge at Shiraz in Juh as Gonsu General for the Soviets vice M. Constantin Pletoukhme, vice-consul-m-eharge. The latter left for Russia in September. M Tehouvounov proceeded to Isfahan in the autumn to take charge of the cons“atlgenei'l andliad not returned to Shiraz by the end of the year. 19. Weat }™-^ rgiiifa]1 during 1934 : 17.23-inches.

T have the honour tp traP yf ^ [yf aP eh e i936. a The budget was passed Budvet for the year 1314, ending A ^-• r ‘ A ’translation of and report on a unanimously b y.^ a s passed on March 13th are being transmitter surmlementaiw budget vinci \ under cover of a separate despa c2 The new budget estimates revenues for the current financial year at seven hundred and fifty one million, one hundred and twenty three thousand, foil] *hundred and eighty seven rials (about eleven million, five hundred and fifty five thousand pounds at the present exceptionally high exchange value of the rial at sixty five to the pound), and expenditure at seven hundred and fifty milhon, eight hundred and twenty seven thousand, seven hundred and ninety rials living an estimated surplus of two hundred and ninety five thousand, six hundred and ninety seven rials (four thousand, five hundred and forty nine pounds). The budget estimates for the previous year balanced at about six hundred' and twenty one million rials, so that the increase in both revenue and expenditure this year is estimated to be higher by approximately one hundred and thirty million rials, or almost twenty one per centum. 3 Increases on the revenue side include an item of twenty six million, two hundred thousand rials (about four hundred thousand pounds) as proceeds of the new monopoly tax on- cotton piece goods—a useful item when it is recalled that an increase of the Customs duties on cotton piece goods is at present pre cluded by treatv stipulations. Income and stamp duties are expected to yield an additional fifteen million rials, Customs duties ten million rials, the Tobacco Monopoly fifteen million rials, and the Opium Monopoly ten million rials. A net increase of nine million rials is anticipated as a result of the substitution of a three per centum, tax on agricultural produce marketed for the previous taxes on land. Similarly, the replacement of motor registration taxes by a tax on motor spirit and paraffin is estimated to give a net increase of ten million seven hundred thousand rials. Other budgeted increases are fourteen million nine hundred thousand rials from the operation of a tar factory, four million five hundred thousand rials from sale of state lands, three million nine hundred thousand rials from the Caspian fisheries, and one million five hundred thousand rials from the working of the red oxide deposits. An item of nine million rials unforeseen revenue may possibly be connected with the institution of an import monopoly for motor vehicles or with some other monopoly scheme not yet disclosed. 4 . On the expenditure side, by far the largest single item is the vote for the Ministry of War, which is higher by twenty million rials. Including provision for road guards the vote for this Ministry amounts to two hundred and forty nine million, four hundred and eight thousand, three hundred and. eighty rials, or almost exactly one-third of total planned expenditure. A special credit of two million pounds for military supplies voted in the supplementary^ budget is not included in this figure. A, special credit of twenty million rials (about three hundred and eight thousand pounds) for road construction indicates that the ordinary revenues from the road tax (which are not shown in the budget) are not sufficient to meet increasing needs of road transport: For agriculture a sum of twelve million seven hundred thousand rials is provided ; last year the Departments of Industry and Agriculture were joint, and no separate vote was shown. A credit of ten million rials for industrial undertakings is only twenty five per centum of the amount voted last year, but separate credits of twenty six million two hundred thousands rials for a cotton spinning and weav ing mill (presumably the one at Ashraf for which the order has already been placed) and fourteen million five hundred thousand rials for the completion of a tar factory, bring the total to about ten million rials more than last year. The contribution to the capital of the Agricultural Bank is increased from five million rials to ten million rials. There is a small increase of three million, four hundred and fifty thousand rials in the credit for the Ministry of Education. Finally, the following items for capital of new State monopoly enterprises are included ; thirty million rials for a Company for the stabilization of the price of grain ; fifteen million rials for a State Insurance Company, and two million two hundred and thirty thousand rials for the recently formed monopoly company for importing cotton piece-goods. The only r important decrease is in respect of the non-recurring item of eighteen million rials voted last y r eai as capital of the Opium Export Monopoly Company. 5 . Comment on the new 7 budget is on the same lines as last y r ear, and is typified by the statement of the President of the Mejlis that he did not see a sign of disagreement or opposition in the face of a single deputy. Details of the State Insurance Company for which provision is made in the budget, have not yet been given. With regard to the stabilization of the price of grain, it was stated that this was intended to secure for agricultural producers a fair price for their grain 5 as a. result their prosperity w T ould be increased, and as aTl. imports: He hopld ftat as Tnternal D rod,ml 1 entl0,1 ^ lib , CTatel y to reduce Iranian produce would be found abroad and 3 '‘'a' 1 ' marli:et for creased imports into Iran of gbods nol product inT d ° f even iu - articles.

A comparative table showing revenue and expendi- tuie estimates for the present and the last budget is attached. (. The budget, as usual, does not cover the whole of the national finances ; on the revenue side it omits the royalties from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the revenue from the sugar and tea monopoly tax and the bulk of the proceeds ot the road tax ; on the expenditure side it omits the cost of railway and road construction. It should also be noted that the actual revenue and expenditure pre ™ us y ears no ^ divulged, so that it is not possible to say what relation the estimates presented bear to reality, nor whether a deficit or a surplus is, carried forward to the next year. 8 - I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overesas Trade f^o. 0.

With reference to my despatch No. 147-E. of to-day’s date [Serial No. (25)] reporting on the Iranian budget for the year 1314, I have the honour to trans mit herewith, a translation from the “ Messager de Teheran” of April 3rd of a supplementary budget law which was . approved by the Mejlis on March 13th. .. * 2. The financial provisions of the law are as follows :— (1) Three hundred million rials (for million, six hundred and fifteen thousand pounds) for railway construction, made up as follows (a) Thirty million rials from the credit for economic institutions in the' budget for 1313. This sum to be paid in replacement of funds said to have been expended from the sugar monopoly revenue for purposes other than railway construction. ; (b) One hundred and twenty million rials from the Sugar monopoly revenue. (c) One hundred and fifty million rials to be borrowed from the National Bank by the Ministry of Roads and Communications. (2) Two million, seven hundred and five thousand pounds from the national reserve as follows (a) Twenty five thousand pounds credit to the Government. (b) Two million pounds for military supplies. (o) Six hundred thousand pounds as an advance to. the Ministry of Roads and Communications for railway construction and rail way material. (d) Eighty thousand pounds to the Department of Industry to meet payments due on sugar factories. (3) Twenty five million, six hundred thousand rials (nearly four hundred thousand pounds) from economies to be realised in the budget for 1314, as follows :— (a) Twenty million rials for expenditure in connection with sugar factories. (b) Five million, six hundred thousand rials for expenditure in con nection with the cement factory. As the budget* for 1314 pro vides for a surplus of less than three hundred thousand rials, it would be interesting to know how .these economies are to be effected. (4) Thirty million rials (four hundred and sixty one thousand, five hundred pounds) for equalisation of transport freights, presum ably a form of export bounty, to be provided as follows Ten million rials from revenues accruing from the motor vehicle monopoly. Fifteen million rials from profits made on purchase and sale of export certificates. Five million rials from economies to be effected in the budget for 1314. 3. Article 12 exempts imports of gold from the payment of Customs duty, and Article 13 makes the entry of silver into Iran free subject to regulations to be sanctioned by the Council of Ministers. Article 14 exempts for a further period of three years from the date of its expiration the law of 1925 exempting from Customs duty imported industrial and agricultural machinery. Articles 15 and 16 deal with infractions of the tobacco monopoly or alcohol excise regula tions. Articles 18 to 21 are of minor importance. Articles 6 and 7 prohibit dealings in foreign bonds and lottery tickets. 4:. Article 8 reserves to Government the monopoly of imports of motor vehicles. This long heralded measure thus at last becomes law, but for the time being import licences are still being issued to motor dealers. A monopoly tax is to be charged, as in the case of the cotton goods monopoly but will not exceedtile charge hitherto In force representing the difference between the official and the actual rates of foreign exchange. The somewhat pious intention of the SmrrsTourceto 6 effect C r Sa / y i UP t 0 fi / ty Per eent ™ of income obtained ircm this source to effect a reduction in the price of motor vehicles is recorded. o. An Article providing for a Government sanitary inspection of casina-s and authorising the Ministry of Finance to lend up to one million rials for this purpose, the advance to be subsequently recovered from the revenue accruing trom inspection charges, was withdrawal as a result of criticism in the Mejlis. &amp; -o P rov ^® s f° r H le organisation by the Agricultural Bank of a B,eal Bstate Mortgage Company, and for the investment in this Company by the Bank of five million rials. v Article 10 requires rail insurance companies working in Iran to deposit a cash security. This security and “ a part of the insurance premiums received m Iran ” must he converted into shares or bonds of the Real Estate Mortgage Company referred to above and he deposited in the Agricultural Bank. The exact meaning of these requirements will no doubt he made clear in the near future in the regulations to he drawn up by the Council of Ministers. 8 . It will be seen from the foregoing that the supplementarv budget law is a document of some importance. From its financial provisions it is clear that the national reserve of foreign currency is being drawn on to an increasing extent and must now be very low—probably not much more than two million pounds. Similarly, the sugar monopoly revenue for railway construction is exhausted, and the process of supplementing it by dipping into the national reserve and borrowing from the Nad on al Bank will no doubt continue. The latter can only lend against its—or the Government’s—gold holding, which is already mainly earmarked against the augmented note issue, and which is therefore likely in the near future to be completely immobilized and unavail able for use in other directions. f).

The situation has since the higne? price f r ■ ; t0 t i ie striking increases registered in the liecome much more difflcul^orving^^t) ^ ^ of December the price °f armelrs to have abandoned the somewhat hopeless attempt at National Bank appears to 11 ^ rial ^ ., cr than s Uver point and as a ? sid^the'fate of exchange has continued to fall with each successive advance of s Iver and Is now about fifty two rials to the pound The situation has ot Silver aim is nprvousness and ancertamtv in Iran, since m bu’ in'e^ cfrcles anv exchange transactions must be effected with the knowledge that further startling advances in the price of silver may bring down the rate % lower and that on the other hand the National Bank may decide at any riven momedt to abandon the attempt to keep pace with silver and to fix on Sme o«ie“ means of deciding the exchange value ot the rial in terms of foreign The leading article in the “ Journal de Teheran ” of Friday, May 3rd, is indicative of these anxieties. After pointing out that owing to-American stiver To cv the rial has risen in four months from eighty two to fifty two to pA 't:*,;:- itssr was as^tsrsrja information'on'the subject but points out that other factors have to be con- s dered besides the price of silver. These factors include the relation between supplv and demand of foreign exchange, the freedom of movement of Tiler To and from the country, the monetary pohcv of the local banks, and the situation of the national balance of payments. The export of silver is pro hibited and the! trading balance is adverse ; the authorities ob\ iousl&gt; cannot contemplate with equanimity an excessive appreciation in Uie exchange valu of tne rial such as will make exports even more difficult to effect. On the ot band the high value of the rial facilitates the importation of foreign products, some of which are needed for the industrialisation of the country, reduces the upkeep cost of the many Iranian students abroad, etcetera. 3 The writer concludes that the. situation is complicated and should be studied so that advantage may be drawn from it in So far as it is favourable to the economic and financial interests of the country, and the brake be applied sharp &gt; as soon as it is felt that a further increase in the exchange value of the rial \umki be harmful. In the midst of general instability the national siBer eurrenc} has in general proved very stable, and efforts must be made to maintain this stability against an excessive appreciation. 4 The article not unnaturally does not give any clear indication as to what action if anv, the National Bank is likely to take in the near future. It does, however, suggest that it may prove necessary to take some action to protect the exporting interests of the country. There is a widespread belief that it is in tended at some convenient date in the near future to cut adrift from silver and to issue some form of token currency. The amount of silver com actually m circulation is not known with any degree of exactitude, hut it is thought that probably two-thirds of the whole amount is already held by the National Banh. The question will still have to be decided on what basis the exchange relations of the rial to foreign currencies will he regulated. The Director o/,the National Bank has several times expressed his preference for the gold s andara ; adherence to sterling would have definite advantages since most of the trade of the country is effected in that currency, and the royalties of the Angio- Persian Oil Company are also paid in sterling ; an attempt by the National Bank itself to peg and control exchange rates is not impossible, but would no inspire great confidence. 5 .

(32) Despatch fegm His Majestv’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 211, dated the 17th May 1935. I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a copy in translation of a new Law of Arbitration, consisting of 38 Articles, passed by the Mejliss in its session of the 28th Bahman 1313 (17th February, 1935) which replaces the former enactments which formed the subject of Sir Robert Clive’s despatch No. 202 of the 11th April, 1929. 2. The new Law would appear to he better conceived than its predecessors. It reduces the scale of fees payable to the arbitrators, excludes cases involving suspension of payment, bankruptcy, and personal status, and is not com pulsory but can be invoked by mutual consent. 3. In marital disputes, however, the Court can impose arbitration upon the demand of either husband or wife. 4. The wording of Article 37 is doubtless a natural corollary to Article VIII of the Marriage Law of the 23rd Mordad, 1310 (15th August, 1931), which enjoins upon husband and wife to treat each other kindly. 5 . In contracts with foreigners Iranian subjects cannot bind themselves to arbitration by any party who is of the same nationality as the other party to a contract. , •' 6 .

On the occasion of the return of the delegation, the local press has been somevhat fulsome m its praise of the hospitahty of the Soviet Trade Commis- sariat, and it is evident that, m addition to visiting Soviet industrial and agri cultural establishments, the delegation was able to conduct fruitful commercial negotiations. _ On May 28th the Messager de Teheran ” reproduced the text of a communique, a copy of which is enclosed, issued by Monsieur Aalam, Dhcetor-Genei al of the Department of Commerce. In this communique it is stated that exchanges of views concerning the trading balance between the two countries have taken place, and that favourable effects on their commercial relations are anticipated. 3. No exact; information has been given concerning any agreements which may have been reached. It will be noted, however that the Soviet-Persian Com mercial Treaty of 1931 is due to expire on June 21st, 1935, and it is very probable that the basis of a new Commercial agreement on somewhat similar lines, has been agreed oil The possibility of some form of agricultural co-operation between the two countries, which would presumably mean Soviet assistance in some form to Iranian agriculture, has been suggested to me. The possibility that such assistance may extend to Iranian State industry is not to be excluded until further information is available, but I am given to understand that this is very unlikely. 4.

The United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his com pliments, and has the honour to transmit : Memorandum hy Mr. Eden upon a Conversation at Geneva on l\Iay 22 , 1955, with M. Kazemi, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, regarding Anglo- Persian Relations. M. Kazemi came to see me to-day, and after we had discussed the Perso- Traqi frontier question said he would like to say a few words about Anglo-Persian relations. He observed that these relations had much improved of late. It had proved possible to dispose in a friendly manner of the question ftw Baluchi m.ovine- of Persian waters and of certain questions connected with the Baluchis- tan-frontier He toTk soLe small credit to himself for this improvement as he had worked hard in the direction of good relations.

M. Kazemi interposed that he was only speaking of sovereignty ; the actual ownership of the land of the islands was no doubt vested in various Arab sheikhs and would not be affected. I replied that T was not at all familiar with the question and had merely given expression fo what seemed to me the most obvious fact about the whole proposal which must strike anyone coming fresh to the subject. M. Kazemi said after a pause that there was no great urgency about the question and that we could all reflect upon it further. As the conversation had already lasted some time, I readily agreed that there was no harm in reflection and M. .Kazemi took his leave.

Despatch from His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office London, No. 201, dated the 4th May 1935. I have the honour to inform you that, according to accounts wdiich have recently appeared in the Tehran press, considerable damage was caused by earthquakes which occurred in Mazanderan on the 5th March and the 12 th April last. 2 . It is stated that in the first of these twenty-seven villages were destroyed and over sixty people lost their lives; whilst in the second, which was more severe, the number of casualties is estimated at 500. Comparatively little damage appears to have been done to the railway line, which passes through the area where the shocks were most severely felt, but the damage to buildings at Sari, Bandar Shah and various villages in the district was evidently considerable. 3. It has been reported, though not in the press, that the earthquake of the 12 th April gave occasion to minor rioting in Mazanderan, in the course of which the police were attacked by the people, who believed that the earthquake was a punishment for the anti-clerical policy of the Grovernment and in parti cular for the prohibition of the Muharram processions. 4. It is a curious fact that, although an account of the second earthquake appeared in the Times of the 24th April and in the Iraq Times of the same date, the first detailed account of the disaster to appear in the Iranian press was contained in the Etelaat newspaper of the 25th April. 5. As several of my foreign colleagues decided to address expressions of sympathy to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I thought it well to send to his Excellency a private letter, of which I have the honour to enclose a copy (not punted) expressing on behalf of the British people the sympathy which they this occasion. Kazemi told me yesterday that he was much touched by this letter and that he was sending it to the Shah. P.Z.-4085|35.

With the Afghan Government, our boundary dispute was led to arbitration of the Turkish Government, and since we have accepted the arbitration, it is the imperative duty of my Government to honour to arbitral opinion. Regarding internal policy, I am not intending at this term to go into details. My views have been expressed in the past terms and I am glad that we have taken strides and made some achievements ; but this people has been so neglectful in the davs past and remained so much behind, and poverty and need has so gravely dominated our life, that the more we try and go ahead the more we realise our deficiencies and the gravity of our needs. It becomes more and more palpable as the days go by that, for approaching our end, the only way is to make more efforts in our works and activities. I have, therefore, instructed by Government not to contemplate any chapters or articles for the programme which must be presented to the Majlis for this term, but to take up work for their programme. This suggestion must not only constitute the principle to be followed by the Cabinet and the official authorities in the country, but the whole population and all the individuals in this country must link their hands together tor a concerted effort to reach the desired end. 1 myself dwell on the same pnncip e, as others have seen, and I invite all Government officials and the Majlis deputies to follow this policy and wish the success of all with the help of the Almignt}- (47) Despatch fbom His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 254, dated the 13th June 1935. I have the honour to inform you that I was received by His Majesty the Shah on the morning of June 12th in order to present Major-General C. J. B. Hay, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., Inspector-General of the Iraq Armv and Military Adviser to the Iraq Ministry of Defence, who had come up to Gulhek on a snort visit from Baghdad,/ 2 . I took the opportunity to express my appreciation of the passage in His Majesty’s speech at the opening of the Majlis on June 6 th in which he referred to the improvement in the relations between Great Britain and Iran. (This was reported in my telegram No. 204 of June 7 th). His Majesty replied \ that what he had said represented his full conviction, our relations had steadily improved and would continue to do so. He was certain that all ques tions outstanding between us would be settled. His Majesty’s Government had many far weightier matters to deal with : their questions with Iran were small, they could not be expected to devote much attention to them and in any case they would not be difficult to settle. 'Later in the audience His Majesty reverted to the subject of Anglo-Iranian relations, as to which he spoke with considerable optimism, and enquired whether I had any further observations to make. I replied that in my opinion considerable progress had in fact been made in disposing of small questions and that even certain more important matters had been dealt with. We now had on our hands the problem of the Baluchi frontier. The Government of India had made proposals which went as far as it was possible for them to go to meet’the Iranian point of view. I hoped this question was also now within sight of settlement. The Shah replied that he thought it could be settled without difficulty and expressed pleasure that the Government of India had understood the Iranian side of the case. His Majesty agreed with me in hoping that further outstanding matters would be easily disposed of. He again expressed with some emphasis the view that relations between the two countries were on a good footing and that the present friendly feeling boded well for the future. He could be quite frank in dealing with me and should any difficulty or dispute arise he would tell me so plainly. I said I thought this was the most reasonable method of procedure and that I should continue to speak quite frankly on my side. 3. In addressing General Hay His Majesty alluded to the Iraq frontier question and also enquired as to the present internal situation in Iraq. I have already reported in my telegram No. 208 of June 12th the language which I used in relation to the first of these two subjects. His Majesty was fairly emphatic in expressing his view that he looked to His Majesty’s Government to take a leading part in reaching a solution of the frontier 'dispute. I was careful to emphasise that our services were unreservedly at the disposal of both parties to assist in reaching a practical settlement' as distinct from a solution of the legal point at issue, but I said that I thought it would be neces sary to await any proposal^ which Nuri Pasha might have to make. As to the legal point, I thought the right course was to allow it to go to sleep. His Majesty replied that the legal point was of little importance. In answer to his enquiry regarding the internal situation in Iraq General Hay said that all the towns and villages which the insurgents had seized had now been occupied by Iraqi troops and he hoped the insurrection was over. His Majesty spoke in very friendly terms of Iraq and made light of the present dispute. He remarked that if General Hay heard reports of any “ nibblings ” at the Iraq frontier by Iranian posts he should pay no attention to them. Iran did not desire to en large her frontiers. He asked General Hay to let his friendly sentiments be known when he returned to Baghdad and General Hay promised to inform His Majesty’s Ambassador. 4. At the beginning of the audience His Majestv expressed his sympthy with the sufferers of the Quetta earthquake and asked for particulars. 5. Throughout the audience, which lasted close on an hour, I was very much impressed by His Majesty’s exceedingly friendly tone in speaking of relations with His Majestv’s Government and by the geniality of his manner. He lost no opportunity of emphasising bis pleasure at the' prevailing good relations and expressed satisfaction when I said that I would* inform you of what he had said.

Silver rials still circulate m Tehran, but in the provinces particularly near the frontiers, the National Bank have not been issuing them and in many places they already command a premium. Consi derable amounts of rials are being smuggled abroad. 5. It seems likely that the National Bank will, as soon as convenient, issue token coins to replace the silver rials which are bound to disappear entire y from circulation before long. Copper coins are already being minted for the lower denominations, as reported by the Commercial Secretary under Over seas Trade (B) No. 83 of April 17th last, and m addition a quantity of old stock of copper coins was put into circulation at the beginning o ^ „ order for new bank notes which is expected to be placed m the very near future, no notes of a lower denomination than ten rials are to be printed Ibis seems to suggest that token coins will be issued in denominations up to live rials, ana that the existing five rial notes will then be withdrawn. 6 A decision will have to be taken before very long as to the method ot fixing the exchange value of the rial. The silver standard having been abon- doned, the choice remains, as indicated m paragraph 4 of my despatch under reference, between the gold standard, adherence to sterling, and a manage currency. 7.

(49) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister,, Tehran, to the^ Foreign Office, London, No. 300-E., dated the 12th July 1935. In continuation of my despatch No. 261-E. of June 14th [Serial No. (48)1, !. have the honour to report the following further developments in the Iranian currency situation and in the situation of the National Bank. 2. In the course of a discussion in the Majlis on June 30th, proceeding the re-election of Messieurs Farchi and Moayed Ahmadi as inspectors of currency emission, a report was given by these two deputies on their work during the past year. The note circulation had increased to four hundred and twenty-one million, six hundred and fifty-three thousand, four hundred and fifty rials ! fon March 21 st, 1935), and the cover had never been less than the statutorysixty per centum. This cover did not include all the metallic reserves held by the Bank and was exclusive of the gold and silver reserves of the Government which were deposited at the Bank. It was now proposed, by order of His Imperial Majesty the Shah (— in whose name, apparently, these reserves were held —) that these Governmental reserves should be added to the capital of the National Bank. 3. The Minister of Finance, at the same session, introduced a motion of double urgency authorising the minting of five million rials worth of copper coins of five, ten, twenty-five and fifty dinars. He said that the rise in the price of silver abroad had led to speculation by unscrupulous persons, and to the illegal export of silver coins ; severe measures would be taken against such persons. In the meantime there was a shortage of small change, particularly in frontier districts, and for this reason a further issue of copper coins was required. The Minister gave an emphatic denial to rumours, which he said were being circulated, regarding the intention of the Government to lower the proportion of silver in the coinage in order to discourage smuggling. 4 . The cover against the note issue was, according to the Minister of Finance, much higher to-day than was indicated in the report of the inspectors. In some countries an excess of expenditure over revenue led to the printing of notes without backing. In Iran during the last ten years revenue had always been provided for before expenditure was approved, and surplus revenue had been employed on useful public works. Thus the country as a whole, as well as the National Bank, had an established financial situation, which ought to have a tranquillising effect on public opinion ; that opinion ought no longer to be disquieted by a rise or fall in exchange rates. The motion for the minting of the coins was approved by the Mejlis. 5. It is doubtful whether public opinion regarding the currency and ex change situation will be so easily tranquillized as the Minister of Finance appears to think. The rial is at present based neither on silver nor on gold, nor pegged to any other foreign currency, and its possible future trend is still an object of speculation. With regard to the Minister’s assurance regarding the maintenance of the proportion of silver in the rial, it will be observed that this would not prevent him from reducing the size of the silver rial nor from replacing the silver coins with nickel or copper token coins. 6 . It may be of interest to record that General Amir Khosrovi, the Managing Director of the National Bank, mentioned a day or so ago to a mem ber of my staff that he had recently produced a scheme which would have been very satisfactory to the financial and commercial interests of the country, but that, for reasons of which he was ignorant; the scheme had been turned down. This possibly referred to the proposal to ship silver in order to cover the Bank’s oversold foreign exchange position (referred to in my despatch No. 293- E. of the 10th July concerning the Imperial Bank of Persia) which would have enabled him to close all his outstanding foreign exchange transactions at a profit. Khosrovi complained that the Government, which obtained its supplies of foreign exchange comfortably from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company royalties, did not appreciate his problems as a banker. Exporters wanted a cheap rial, but even more they needed stability of exchange rates. He had accordingly submitted a further proposition, also without success, which would have secured both these objects. As the conversation was interrupted at this point, it is not clear whether he was referring to some scheme for an exchange equali zation fund, or to his oft-repeated desire for the introduction of a gold standard. The latter is perhaps most likely, as it is generally understood that an exchange equalization fund supplied to the National Bank about two \ears ago was completely exhausted last year. 7. I am reporting separately on a bill introduced before the Mejlis to increase the capital of the National Bank, as foreshadowed in the last sentence of paragraph 2 of this despatch. 6 .

Article III provides that the hill becomes law after its ratification by Parliament. r ‘ t # t, 6 . It is not clear to me what is the precise significance of the Project out lined above. In the first place, the gold which is now added to the BanK s capital was already transferred to the Bank and earmarked as additional, cover to he increased note issue in September, 1934, as reported m Sir K. H. lioare s despatch No. 434-E. of 22nd September 1934 (Serial No. 113 m File No. 1-N.|34). My mystification on this matter was apparently shared by at any rate one Deputy in the Mejlis, whose tactless question as to whether the transaction did not diminish the metallic cover against the notes in circulation was apparentlv unwelcome —‘ i faillit facher le Ministre des Finances , m the vor of the “ Setareh ye Djehane ” of July 10th. In the second place, as the export of gold bullion is prohibited, it is difficult to see in what way the Position ot tne Bank will he strengthened by the addition to its capital of this gold. It seems then, at the moment, that the measure is one of “ window-dressing designed to impress waverers with a greater confidence in the stability ot me “ economic axis of Iran ” than they have recently been inclined to show. 7.

This does not, however, mean that the British national could in no circum stances be so tried in peace time, since a state of siege may be proclaimed in a time of internal disturbance or other emergency without a state of war being necessarily in existence. Were the category of cases which are triable before military tribunals under the Persian law so wide as to include a large number of ordinary civil offences, it might be possible to contend that to try British subjects for such offences before military tribunals would be inconsistent with the undertakings given in 1928. The offences specified are however of such a nature that it is quite reasonable for them to be triable by militarv tribunals during the existence of a state of siege. I am advised there fore that no objection could be raised to the trial of a British subject before a military tribunal for any of the offences specified, provided always that a state of siege had been proclaimed. 4 Were an attempt made to try a British national before a military court when a state of siege had not been proclaimed, it would be possible to base representations to the Persian Government upon No. 3 of the measures mentioned '.in the Persian note of the 10th May 1928, referred to above The extent to which the undertakings contained in that note can be held to be binding upon the Persian Government and the considerations by which you should be guided, should it appear desirable at any time to make representations to the Persian Government on the b ^ s p 0 fi f t ^ s o e taking were fully dealt with in my despatch No. 451 of the 6 th November, 1933 ^Serial No 159 in F.

The foreign Legations in Tehran are, in principle, not entitled to possess wireless receiving and transmitting apparatus; permission to the Legations of friendly Powers for possessing receiving apparatus will be granted only on condition that, firstly .: they obtain special permission from the Imperial Government, and secondly: their Governments reciprocally grant the right of maintaining a receiving apparatus to the Imperial Persian Legation stationed in the Capital of their respective countries. In view of the above, His Majesty’s Legation are requested to state in reply, as early as possible, whether they possess any wireless apparatus, either receiving or transmitting, and if so, to give the specification and details of the same, and also inform the Ministry for Foreign Affairs as to the policy of their Government with regard to reciprocal treatment in respect of receiving apparatus. 2. Since an Institution, named the “Agence Pars” is now being established, which has the exclusive duty of centralising news and informa tion in Persia and of disseminating the same in an appropriate manner, His Maiesty’s Legation are accordingly notified that they should retrain from disseminating the news which they now receive, as from the 2 th Mordad 1313 (Uth August, 1934).

Translation of note No. 21775 dated Mordad 25th 1313 (August 16th 1934) from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty’s Minister. Your Excellency’s esteemed note of Mordad 20th 1313 (August 11th 1934) No. 526 was duly received. I find it necessary to bring the following to your notice. 1 . The correspondence alluded to in Your Excellency’s note under reply winch is said to have been exchanged lately between the British Foreign Office and the Persian Charge d’Afiaires in London has not yet reached the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 2 . As regards the question of the reception of the official British wire less news and the manner of dissemination of the same, although a reply in these matters is dependent upon the decision which is to be taken in connection with the receiving apparatus of the honourable Legation so far as the question of obtaining permission from the Persian Government and the observance of reciprocal treatment is concerned, and although I am wait ing for a reply from Your Excellency on the subject,, yet, with a view to avoiding any possible misunderstanding, as Monsieur Motamedi has ex plained a few days ago to Mr. Trott, I have the honour to state that by the concluding paragraph of this Ministry’s memorandum No. 20499 it was not meant that the “Pars” agency had requested that (foreign) Legations should hand to that institution (the Pars agency) the news and information which they may receive so that the Pars agency may enter into negotiations in the matter, but, as has already been stated clearly in the memorandum referred to above, it is entirely at the Legation s discre tion to supply free of charge, if they so desire, the Pars, agency with any news of general interest which they may receive by various means m order that that institution may utilise the news which they may think nt for their requirements without incurring any liability under any obligation or undertaking either for the present qr for the future. In other words, the “Pars” agency will be entirely free as to the dissemination or otherwise of the news received, and will not accept any conditions or stipulations m this respect. 3. As regards the statement made in the paragraph 4 of Your Excel- lencv's note under reply to the effect that I had told you that any news * handed to the Agency by the Legation would be issued^ to the public m extenso, I regret to say that a misunderstanding has arisen m the matter as I have not made such statement to Your Excellency, the only thing which I stated to you was that the “Pars” Agency may utilise the news of general interest which they may receive. 4 . With regard to Your Excellency’s presumption that the Imperil Court and the Departments of the Persian Government which have m the past received copies of the British news may wish still to do so, I have the honour to state (sic) that, as mentioned in this Ministry y s memoranduni No. 20499, as the “Pars” Agency has the exclusive duty of centralizi 0 news and information in Persia and disseminating the same in an appro priate manner. Your Excellency will arrange that the British wireless ne should not be sent to any other place. Enclosure V .Letter from H.

With regard to the British official wireless, I venture to observe that the endeavour of those responsible for it is to supply news which will interest as many different tastes as possible and also to inform foreign as well as English readers of the views held in journalistic and other circles on current events. I must admit that I consider it a little ungracious that the Pars Agency should be unwilling to send a messenger to collect useful news which°is offered them gratis, but as I attach some importance to the news being available, I propose for the present at any rate to send it to the Agency myself. 3 . With regard to paragraph 3 of Your Excellency’s note, I will merely say that I quite understood you to say that the Pars Agency would use the British official wireless if I supplied it. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration. Enclosure VI.

As reported in my telegiam No. 113 of today’s date, the Shah received me yesterday evening in order that I might present to His Majesty Air Vice Marshal, C. S. Burnett who has come here on a short holiday from Baghdad. I had told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he was coming and had asked whether or not the Shah would wash to see him. 2. After some general discussion on the value of air-craft, especially from the angle of internal security, in the course of which the Air Vice Marshal remarked appropriately on the progress made since he was in Persia fourteen years ago, the Shah told us that he intended to ask for the services of a British air mission to control the workshops which were be ing erected and to train Persian mechanics. His intention was eventually to build aeroplanes in Persia. The Air Vice Marshal told him that no air force could live without efficient repair shops; they were the first essential, and when they were working well actual construction could be considered. 3 . Details of this part of the conversation will be reported by Air Vice Marshal Burnett to the Air Ministry. 4. 1 then said that I had read with great interest the accounts of His Majesty’s visit to Turkey. He replied that he had been determined to put an end to the century old friction between the two countries and it was his intention to establish good relations with all countries with which Persia was in contact, not only with her great neighbours, but also with her small, and especially with Iraq. There were difficulties, and it was in admissible that the Persian sloops should be interfered with when passing through the Sbatt-el-Arab up to Mohammerah. (I do not know what these “Incidents” are unless His Majesty had been given a distorted version of the narrowly averted collisions ^frMitioned in my despatch No. 13 of January 8 th, 1934.) (F. No. 504-N/33.) He regarded the Iraqis as his brothers and would always do so, even if their attitude was unfriendly and showed a disregard of Persia's rights. He hoped that British influence would be exerted to promote a settlement. 5. I replied that the matter was outside my province; moreover, Iraq was an independent state and a member of the League of Nations. 6 . The Shah refused to be impressed by this and said something which rather suggested that perhaps His Majesty’s Government w r ere not averse to a perpetuation of differences between Persia and Iraq. 7. I asked him to believe that this was not at all the case, and said that a practical solution of any difficulties w’hich might exist in the Shaft- el-Arab could be found by the constitution of the Conservancy Board which had been suggested. 8 . The Shah let the conversation drop and shortly after he concluded the audience, after assuring the Air Vice Marshal that he had been glad to receive him and would welcome future visits. .While we were standing and taking our leave, he once again told the Air Vice Marshal that the Iraqis were his brothers and that he wished him to tell the Iraq Government that he had said so. The Air Vice Marshal promised to convey this per sonally to King Ghazi. 9 His Majesty then turned to me and said that he quite liked diplo mats but liked soldiers rather more (a little suggestive of a housemaid, but that is how Kazemi translated), and we made ouy bow§ and departed. 10 . I am sure that the Shah was delighted to see the Air Vice Marshal ana ne publicly evinced his pleasure in a large dinner party given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs last night. I think that a visit by him to the Minister would be a useful annual institution, in that it would afford the incumbent of fh ls post an extra opportunity—opportunities being rare— of seeing the Shah and learning what at the moment he has in mind, oij perhaps what he wishes us to think is on his mind.11 . I will conclude this despatch by reporting two apparently trivial facts :—The Chief of Staff and Acting Minister of War was unashamedly terrified when I suggested that the Air Vice Marshal should pay him a call; his namesake, who commands the Air Force, declined, after a sensible interval, an invitation to dine at the Legation on the day before yesterday on the plea that he had received forty-eight hours leave as from the morning of that day. He attended last night’s banquet and told me that he had had twenty-four hours leave. Fear will soon be the only factor that counts at Tehran. 12 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 187), and to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Baghdad (No. 64).

(104) {Received on 15th September, 193A, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 35, dated 30th August, 193A.) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London (No. 308), dated the 23rd June, 1934. No. 1.('0 I have the honour, to report that the Majlis, on the 8 th Khurdad, 1313 (the 29th May, 1934), passed a law authorising the foundation of a uni versity at Tehran. It will be remembered that an institution known as the “Dar-ul-Funun,” or Academy of Sciences, has long existed here, having been founded, I believe, by Mirza Taghi Khan Amir-Kabir, who was exe cuted by Nas’ir-ud-Din Shah’s order in the fifties of last century. That academy engaged several foreign professors from time to time, and stlW survives after various modifications; it is now to be replaced by a fully- fledged university. 2. The law contains twenty-one articles, and is somewhat lengthy; I will therefore summarise its main provisions for your information; a copy of the text in translation can be sent if desired. ' One interesting feature of the law is that it enriches the Persian language by several new words, all of purely Persian origin, designed to replace other words, of Arabic origin, which have hitherto been in use. A university becomes a “danish-gah” '(wisdom-place); a faculty is a “danish-kedeh” (wisdom-temple); a teacher'a130 ‘ecole normale” becomes a “danish-sara” (wisdom-shop or wis- •' ” a high school or lycee is a school” a “dabistan.” The highest rank of dom-inn); a technical school is a ‘‘honanstdn Ser S or n professo P r r is'now to te called an^ustad” under~him are three ranks, with the less familiar names “damsh-yar (friend of wisdom), “dabir” and “amuzgaE.” , , . ,.u , n, _ , TT . 3 Article 1 of the law sanctions tlie foundation of a Tehran Lmversity for instruction in the higher branches of the sciences, the arts, literature and philosophy. • Six faculties ar.e named in article 2; the first is that of inductive and deductive sciences; the second,, natural sciences and mathe matics; the third, literature, philosophy and pedagogy; the fourth, medi- dne with all its branches; the fifth law,and political and economic science; and the sixth, technical subjects. Existing schools of fine arts, and colleges, may be accepted as institutes of the Tehran University by affiliation or 4 The principal of the university is to be appointed by Royal decree on the proposition of the Minister of Education. He will be responsible for administration and will nominate his subondnates. His appointment will be for three years, at the expiration of which he may be reappointed. A university council, embracing all the heads of faculties and some others, will administer the university, being charged with the preparation of condi tions of entry,, details of courses of studies, preparation of rules for exami nations, and other duties. Each faculty will have a council of its own, on which its teachers will be represented. (lT . y , 5. The university will have a judicial status, and will be dependent solelv on the Ministry of Education. It will^ collect fees anp submit ac? counts to the Ministry. “Usttids” and “damsh-yars ara to be selected by competitive examination in case several candidates apply for the posts, and their salaries are laid down in the law. Should no suitable candidate be available for an instructional post, persons whose competency is attested by the university council may be engaged by contract. ^ 6 . Various regulations deal with the selection of dabfrs’ and f danish- yars” and their increments, promotion and retirement, reference Being mads to the Civil Service Law. 7. Article 20 states that the university is authorised to grant honorary degrees with the approval of the Minister of Education. . .. 8 . It remains to be seen on what lines this institution will develop. The education of Persia hitherto has been developed on French lines. A number of Fpench professors and teachers have been serving in Tehran ever since the old Darrul-Funun was founded, and they have naturally imparted a very French character to the official svstem of public instruction here. On tEe other hand, a great number of tEe present, as well as the coming generation in Tehran have been educated at the American College, the staff of which are all Americans and the, organisation of which is as, near to the American model as it can be made. The present Acting Minister of Education himself is one of its “alumni”; and he, as well as a few other influential persons in the Ministry and the present colleges, has been heard to observie that the Anglo-Saxon system of education, with its less rigid rules and lack of centralisation, is preferable to the French model, and more suited to the Persian character. 9. I bear that Kitabji Khan has already been sent to Europe on an official mission in connexion with the university, and that he intends to visit England in the course of his mission, t (105) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 406, dated the 28th August, 1934. In continuation of my despatch No. 384 of August 22 nd (S. No. 98), I ffiaveThe honour to inform you that a careful examination has been mada by the Oriental Secretariat of the news published in the Persian PressN 7* ^ list i§ 1 ;. it (m. fill tie rtf'i Sis apjoi^ be mr )f ides lii will be Ip ?es and m are to h pply for i ) suitable i opetenqisi abirs” aiit nt, refereiitf n. on Freud Si rving in Id’*- e natural?® Jic instra^' s well as tb ;- can ■■ which is 2 j’ : i well as leges, has i with ^ enc ent» 131 t during the period August 11 th to the present date under the title “Agence l^ars . (August 10th or 11 th was the date on which the new Agence com menced work). 2 . During that time the Agency’s foreign news, the source of which is never stated, has been connected principally with the following subjects :— (a) The Plebiscite in Germany. (b) The death of Hindenburg. (c) Events in Austria. (d) Restrictions and developments in America. (e) Tension between Russia and Japan in the Far East. 3. Hardly anything relating to Great Britain has been published. A short paragraph of three lines in the Tttila’ of the 21 st dealt with the new inland aerial postal service, but it was not taken from the British News; it presumably emanated from Renter. 4. As far as can be discovered, the only direct translation from the British Official news so far published, dealt with the strict control of potatoes in Germany. 5. The only instance of news relative to the British Empire so far diseminated by the Agency was a report published on August 24th in the “Messager de Teheran”, purporting to emanate from London, to the effect that owing to the Commonwealth Government having raised the duty on Lancashire cotton goods, a considerable body of public opinion in the north of England had advocated a boycott of Australian products unless a reduc tion was effected. The telegram went on to draw a moral from this by saying how difficult was the position of many British Dominions and Colonies since their economic interests were often more closely linked with those of a foreign country than with the United Kingdom. Canada was instanced as having more in common economically with the United States •of America than with Great Britain; Australia, with the United States of America and Japan. The message concluded with the opinion that this difference of opinion between Australia and the United Kingdom may have profound repercussions on the economic evolution of the Empire. 6 . Mr. Mallet had a conversation at a recent tea party with Monsieur Malek Karam, the editor of the “Messager”, and Monsieur Motamedi of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on this subject, and a copy of a minute summarising this is enclosed herein. 7. I need hardly say that the inaugur,ation of the new agency has been received with fulsome praise in the local press. 8 . The various foreign Legations continue to distribute their news to their colleagues and private persons as heretofore and, so far as I am aware, no attempt has been made by the Persian Government to put a stop to this. It may, however, very likely be the next step. 9. I understand that the Agency is for the present under the charge of a Frenchman who received his training under “Havas”’. This may to some extent account for the nature of the items chosen for publication. The exclusion of items of British news may also be due to the absence on the Agency of anybody capable of translating English fluently as well as to the fact that for the last few days the British news has contained! nothing of much interest to foreigners. 10. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 190). ST, 1^' natio 11 ' in tie U Enclosure,- Minute.

M a tirnt the first week s customs r P ^ practice has Rdusand odd pounds required for the service of the loan, tne p .been only to pay over to the Persian Government the balance at the end of each completed month, interest at one per centum being allowed on the sum involved. As a matter of fact he had frequently, by private arrangement with the Treasurer General, made advances before £he expiration of the month, 5. What was now being asked was—and the Acting Treasurer General made it clear that it was a matter of the Shah’s personal amour-'propre— that the southern customs receipts should be credited to the Persian Govern ment as and when encashed on precisely the same footing as the receipts from other customs posts; in return the Persian Government would under take to pay one month in advance, the money required for the service of the loan. 6 . I observed to Mr. Wilkinson it seemed to me that what was in fact proposed was to substitute the general guarantee of the Persian Govern ment for a definitely ear-marked source of revenue, therby depreciating the value of the security. He agreed that this was what it amounted to. 7. Turning to the two paragraphs I have quoted above, I said that it seemed to me that it would be no violation of their sense if he offered to liberate to the Persian Government the revenues as they came in week by week, instead of at the end of the month, once the sum required for the loan service was encashed. 8 . After some further discussion we agreed that Mr. Wilkinson would make the offer indicated above as a practical solution of the matter. We imagine that if it is indeed a fact that amour-propre is involved, this offer would not be acceptable. In that case Dr. Wilkinson will sav that all he can do is to refer the matter to the Board of the Bank, and indicate that in his opinion, the latter will probably decide that the terms of the Loan Agreement preclude them from meeting the wishes of the Persian Govern ment. 9. The only explanation of this curious development which I can think of is that the Shah has demanded that some sort of statement of the day by day money available should be prepared for him; that when this statement had been prepared it showed that the southern customs receipts were not available except after a delay of a week or two; that the explanation of this circumstance which he received did not satisfy him and he concluded that a foreign lien on the southern customs was no longer in accordance with the spirit of the times and that Persian sovereign rights must there fore be immediately asserted.

I told M. Paternotte that a Greek engineer was seeking to interest British capital in the railway, but that I did not know what success he was having; there seemed, frima facie, to be the possibility of co-operation. 5. With regard to the northern oil-field, I knew that relations between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company end the Royal Dutch were very friendly and I proposed to pass on to Mr. Jacks what M. Paternotte had said. M. Paternotte replied that he would be very glad if I did so. 6. You will see from my despatch No. 372 of to-day’s date that Mr. Hart, the late American Minister here, and his expert associate, Mr. Clapp, are also in the field, but have for the moment abandoned it as the Persian Government have asked q fantastic price for a concession in only one of the four northern provinces.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Aimbassador, Paris, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 1412, dated August 31, 1934. With reference to your despatch No. 1263 of the 22nd August regarding rumoured negotiations for a French loan to Persia, I have the honour to inform you that it has been ascertained at the Ministry of War that there is no Persian military mission in France at the present time and, in fact, no Persian officer, as the Persian military attache has been recently recalled, whether temporarily or permanently is not known. Nor had the Ministry heard of any negotiations concerning a loan. 2. As you will be aware from Lord Tyrrell’s despatch No. 1708 of the 12th December last, a number of French officers on individual contract are at present serving in Persia. It is, therefore, unlikely that any financial negotiations with a view to the ultimate purchase of military supplies could be in progress without the Ministry of War being aware of them. 3 . In the event of any information reaching me, I will at once com municate it to you. ( 113 ) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 434-R., dated the 22nd September 1934. 1 have the honour to report that in its session of September 11th, the Meilis approved a bill submitted by the Minister of Finance providing for an increase of six hundred and thirty-five million Rials m the authorised note issued. \ , _ . ^ .d 2 Article I of the Bill authorises the National Bank to order the printing of new bank notes for a sum of six hundred and thirty-five million Rials and to increase the amount of notes in circulation up to a maximu of eio-bt hundred million Rials (equivalent to about ten million Pounds), l^st “reunion the Bah Lst hold not less ^-ixty per cen.im ° f '‘rArtmte? pSsttat KoM bf/s Xh'hid Sr^iotlTacqS by d the JovernLnt are to be transferred to the Bank and held as cover against tto^te issue. ^ ^ ^ was 5.

Against this- issue, the cover is understood to consist approximately as follows :— 1 Geld bars (taken at 78 Rials to the pound, or £7 an ounce) . Rials 280,000,000. Silver bars and coins 423,00j,000' f oreign exchange held abr oad. » . • « • 87,000,000 This constitutes a reserve of seven hundred and forty million Rials against a note circulation of eight hundred million Rials, or ninety-two decimal five per centum.. I 7 The minimum legal reserve against the note issue is to be sixty per centum, or four hundred and eighty million Rials. The Persian Goverm ment at present will therefore be able, if they so desire, to employ some two hundred and sixty million Rials of their excess cover (equivalent to about three million, two hundred and fifty thousand pounds) for other purposes. 8 . The new measure- appears on the whole to have been well, received. There has been undoubtedly a shortage of currency in circulation, as was indicated in the enclosure to my despatch No. 473 of October 7th, 1933. paragraph 5. The proposed increase in the note issue will more than make good this shortage, and the local press states that the additional notes wall be largely used in paying wages, etc., on important public works, particular mention being made of the projected barrage of the Karoun river at Ahwaz.. In so far as the money is used on public works of a productive nature it is difficult to raise any objection to the new measure, and it cannot be denied that the proposed cover ought to be ample. 9 . At the same time, the measure is a little dangerous if any impert- ance is to be attached to the comments of the local press suggesting that by the new bill Persia has suddenly become magically enriched by an addi tional five hundred million Rials. By the same argument the issue of an additional two billion Rials would enrich the country to a still greater extent by the simple use of the printing press. One will also have to wait and see whether the proposed reserve of three hundred million Rials is actually kept on hand for replacing used notes, or whether having enjoyed a taste' of the benefits of currency expansion, the temptation to put them surreptitiously into circulation will not prove too great. 10. It does not appear to be anticipated that the considerable increase in note circulation will have any marked effect on the rates of exchange, although an increase in internal prices rs apparently expected. Since the measure was passed, however, the Rial rate has risen from some seventy- eight to the Pound to about eighty-one. It must not be forgotten that a fall in the value of the Rial would be of appreciable assistance to the Persian export trade, which the Government are so anxious to foster in view of the increasing adverse balance of trade. _ It does not seem unreasonable to suppose that a certain moderate fall in the exchange value of the Rial would not be unwelcome to the Government, as it ought to be possible to check any excessive movement in view of the ample cover at present held. Such a fall would not increase the cost of Government purchases abroad, since these are mainly effected in foreign currencies drawn from exchange deposits held abroad. 11. It seems quite conceivable that the Persian Government may, have in mind the early stabilization of the Rial, either in terms of sterling, at some rate which they may judge advantageous. If such s taDin- zation should give the Rial an appreciably lower rate than at presen , a tion would have to be paid to the silver coins at present in circulation, wnos value based on the world price of silver would be appreciably above tneir nominal exchange value. In such circumstances, extensive smuggling Rials abroad would be bound to take place, in spite of the export restnc i &gt; _ and the Government might find itself compelled to withdraw the siiv r from circulation and to replace them with a token currency. 12 I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade [No. O. T. to the Foreign Secretary to the Government wid to His Maiesty’s Charge d’Affaires at BaghOaDespatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 431, dated the 21st September, 1934. With reference to my despatch No. 406 of August 28th last, I have the honour to transmit a copy of a note addressed to me by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of the wireless telegraph receiving set used in this Legation. It will be seen that, as foreshadowed in para graph 2 of my despatch No. 384 of August 22nd, the Persian Government are determined to extract a formal application for permission to maintain the set. 1 2 . I am not clear how far it is advisable or possible for me to rely on diplomatic privilege in this matter. The attitude of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who are of course acting under instructions either from the Ministry of war or the Shah himself, is, as usual, discourteous, but it may nevertheless be difficult for me to claim that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is acting beyond his powers in requesting that His Majesty’s Legation obtain the Persian Government’s permission to maintain an instrument which they have every right to maintain under the rules of international and diplomatic courtesy. * 3 . I am unwilling to ask for permission if it can be avoided, as to do so would constitute an admission that the Persian Government had the right to withdraw this permission at any time. 4 . It would appear from the third paragraph of Mr. Warner’s letter (T.-299/299/373) of January 8 th last, to the Persian Charge d’Affaires that if the Persian Legation in London wished to instal an apparatus for wireless telegraphy or wireless telephony for official purposes, the Post master General would be prepared to grant them exemption from the neces sity of taking out a licence and paying the necessary fee, but that if they were ready to pay the latter, there would be no necessity for them to approach His Majesty’s Government in the matter at all. If it is the case that the word “Permission” as used in this paragraph of Mr. Warner s letter refers to exemption from the necessity of obtaining a^ licence and not to the actual installation of the apparatus, and seeing that in any event the Persian Charge d’Affaires was informed in a subsequent letter (T.-179L 299/3731, dated February 19th last, that there was no obstacle to foreign missions ’receiving wireless messages for official purposes, it is not quite clear to me what is the bearing on the situation of . re ^ u ]^ tlol i s n in paragraph 2 of your despatch No. 270 (P.-1411/17/150) of May 30th last, k t should accordingly be grateful for the fullest information on this point and also for an explanation as to the precise meaning of the phrase “for purely official purposes” as applied to the use of a set by a foreign mission Would the Persian Legation for instance be entitled to distribute the bulletins of the Pars Agency, if picked up on their set and, if so,_ to whom? In any future correspondence with the Ministry for Foreig \ffairs here it would be most useful to me to know not merely what for malities if any, must be complied with by a foreign mission m London before they can instal a set but also the maximum use which they would be allowed to make of such a set. 6 . As regards the last sentence of Monsieur Suheih’s note I need only say that, if he had perused the enclosure to my note No. (of ” a copy was sent to your department under cover of my despatch No. 384 of August 22nd), it would have been clear to him that the Persian Legation in London had already been informed that there was no obstacle to their installing and maintaining a wireless telegraph receiving se . 7 In view of the importance attached by His Majesty’s Government tn thp’dissemination of the British Official News and of the somewhat com- , Heated auctions of privilege involved, I have thought it well, pending' the reetp?i'n of yoSr hews, to return no reply to the Acting Minister forForeign Affairs’ note.

I must confees that I feel in a weak position in pressing for customs franchise on these stores though I intend, subject to your approval, to press for their exemption from Trade Monopoly Law restrictions not only on the grounds of courtesy but also on the ground that the stores are Government property and are paid for with money from outside Persia. 8 .

Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London. No. 426-E., dated the 19th September 1934. In my despatch No. 328 of the 1 st July 1933 (F. No. 80-M.), I report ed on the problem facing the Persian Government consequent on the aboli tion of the restrictions on exporters’ exchange, and the accumulation of a considerable amount of this exchange on Government account held by the National Bank and the Imperial Bank of Persia. The amount of this exchange held by the banks at the time of the abolition of the restrictions (the 29th May 1933) is not known, but according to a report in the Persian press the holdings on the 20 th March, 1933, totalled, in all currencies, 2,469,634 dollars, or about £722,120 at the then ruling rates of exchange. 2. No particulars have been published recently showing the amounts of exporters’ exchange still held by the banks, but I am reliably informed that by about the middle of August the holdings had been reduced to 648,000 dollars and £84,000, or the equivalent at present rates of exchange of about 1,068,000 dollars or £213,600. 3 Durino* the past year or so the Persian Government have thus been able to reduce their holdings of this exchange, which had represented a considerable paper loss in view of the appreciation of the rial m terms ot most foreip'n currencies and the parallel depreciation of the dollar, by approximately £500,000. The loss has been passed on to the trading com munity. and in the long run to the consumer of imported goods. It is sUl necessary for importers of certain classes of goods, including motor cars and trucks spare parts, tyres and tubes to purchase a certain amount ot their foreign exchange from the authorised banks at th \ 28-28 rials to the dollar and 105 rials to the pound.

A very large number of Vatnut Turkomans crossed the frontier here last year, probably about 10,' 00. The total figures for all refugues from Central Asia for this period is probab.y nearer 30,000 whieh is an estimate given by the Amir Lashkir of the Eastern Army. As can be seen, the majority of these emigrants consist of the nation alities bordering on Persia, i.e., the inhabitants of Turkistan: Turkomans and Kirghiz. These knowing the frontier region crossed into Persia in complete seUlements with the remnants of their possessions, their camels, horses, donkeys and household effects. All Turkomans on reaching Meshed were put under the control of the Military Headquarters for settlement and distribution by districts. In view of the past warlike history of the Turkomans the Persian Gov ernment appears afraid to grant much freedom to these emigrants, and the Military effect their settlement with this strategic in view. The result has been the cause of much suffering. No land is made available for them with good climatic conditions, they are settled in unhealthy areas short of water, or marshy districts, or those bordering the. desert region near Sarakhs. As an example of the conditions of settlement may be quoted the ease of a group of 300 “Salir” Turkomans settled at Bagh Bagu (between Meshed and Sarakhs) in a marshy district in 1932. During one year 220 died of malaria and only 80 at present remain alive. The other Turkomans also exist under difficult and trying conditions. Jn these very remote places from the towns they, cannot develop their crops and are forced to sell them for a song where they stand. Thev cannot even count on raising enough for even their own consumption in' these remote and unhealthy districts of Persia. The solution of this difficulty would be to permit the emigrants them selves to seek suitable unoccupied districts and afford them State assistance in the form of a loan to develop irrigation to render habitable fresh areas tor their settlement. The Kirghiz exclusively a nomad people who exist by stock rearing i n Russia, here (m Persia) are forced to become coolies. They have found work in various places and there are no special regulations limitine their freedom of movement. They are distributed in various districts between Meshed and Tehran. ; Note .— Many are temporarily working on road construction.

By their Right from the country they demonstrate their disillusionment m any possible bright future for the Soviet Regime. The greater number of refugees cross the frontier in the spring, in March and April which is the easiest time to cross and at the same time coincides with the most critical period of the year with regard to food sup plies in Russia. As an average, the monthly arrivals in Meshed might be taken as 500 Turkomans and 20 Russians. From April this year (1934), (note: actually from the beginning of the year) on account of strict orders which have been issued (by the Persian Gov ernment) with few exceptions, all refugees crossing the Persian frontier have been returned to Russia. The exceptions are the families of emigrants who are already in Persia, and foreigners escaping through Persia to their native countries. t The great numbers attempting to escape into Persia and the percent age that comes to grief on the frontier is shown by the evidence of certain refugees who have escaped from the prison at Askhabad. Out of the total number of prisoners there are not less than 1,000 persons ^ undergoing sentence for attempted crossing of the frontier, a figure which is main tained the whole year through. Since after 4 or 5 months imprisonment for crossing the frontier the prisoners are liberated or sent to exile, it may be estimated that the nmnher so incarcerated reaches about 2,000 per year^, which in comparison with tiie average annual number reaching Meshed (about 200), shows ^ that 90 per cent, are caught and 10 per cent, succeed in entering Persia. These figures do not apply to Turkomans or Kirghiz who when arrested crossing the fron tier are not imprisoned but sent to exile to the North. ' When emigrants reach Meshed, i.e tf Russians, Armenians, dews arid others, they are taken over by the Police (Nazmieh) of the Province of Khora sail. Russians are not permitted to remain in the vicinity of the frontier, for which reason they are made to choose some town for residence outsi e Khorasan, Ma zander an or the Tabriz districts.'All such places are located in the interior of Persia and are not indus trial centres but exclusively agricultural. It is practically impossible for the majority of the qualified Workers to find employment, and on arrival in such towns the refugbes live for a long time in great need until they manage SomehoW or other to find jobs individually in newly opened up undertakings. Ibis system of selection of place for settlement for refugees is exceed- ingly unpractical, and in order to save the unfortunate refugees much un necessary suffering it is extremely desirable that a special Police depart ment fbr dealing with this question should be created in Tehran which Would be kept informed of labour demands of State or other undertakings and dispatch refugees in accbrdahce With their qualifications to tb'ke up such employment. A great difficulty also exists in the absence of any documents in the possession of the emigrants on the authority of which temporary residence permits can be issued to them. The institution of an authority for the issue of JMansen Passports is urgently required for the emigrants in Persia in the absence of which they are unable to travel to other countries where they might successfully exploit their qualifications. Emigrants have no right to create or organise any form of Committees and tnere is no recognised definition of their rights. In any case the living Conditions and state of the refugees is entirely dependent on the attitude of the local Government servants. Such a mass of refugees totalling tens of thousands should have some statutory rights as emigrants, and at the same time a representative from the League of Nations with authority to represent on their behalf to the Persian Government questions relative to the betterment of their position and living conditions. Notes by Translator. Explanatory notes have been added where it appeared desirable lo the text of the document. With regard to the subject matter of the Keport: — 1 . In substance it is correct. The tabulated particulars refer only to the Russian element of the refugees, not the Asiatics or the Molokans. As mentioned in the “Notes” the figures only refer to the numbers registered in Meshed, presumably by the Nazmieh from whom if is thought the parti culars must have been obtained. These particulars though representative of the generahsituation certain ly do not give an accurate idea of the total numbers which have arrived across the frontier during the period in question. It is impossible to arrive at any thing more than an approximate estimate. It is thought that the actual‘figures of refugees from Central Asia crossing into Persia East of the Caspian, during the years 1932-34 might be approximately: — Turkomans and Kirghiz Molokans . • Russians Caucasians and others s Jews . 27,000 2,000 1,000 500 . ' ] , 0 &lt; 0 Total . 31,500 2 Regaraing tlie num&amp;rs returnee! by, tbe-Uersiails dn'the frontier or caright bv the Soviet Frontier'Guards atteffiptmg to cross ^ The figure of 2 000 per annum given in the report may not be an exaggeration. A re ugee who vvaVofice hhnada back By ffie'Pefsian Frontier Guards to the G. P. XT. 162(0) F&amp;PD.but succeeded in escaping from Askhabad prison in August 1934 and arrived m Meshed without being rearrested, told me that out of the 300 odd pri soners in the batch with which he was imprisoned about 40 were under sentence for attempting to cross the frontier into Persia. It is known the total in Askhabad prison exceeds 2,000, so the figures given by the refugee can only be regarded as indicative. 3 » First hand evidence exists of the miserable condition of the refugees in some of the towns in the interior of Persia where no work can be found, many are reduced to begging. They are given 1 Rial per day by the Persian authorities for food when they are out of employment. (Which is the state of the majority). Particularly miserable is the lot of the large number of refugees stranded in such towns as Kazvin, Zinjan, Sabzewar and Isfahan. In other parts some have been fortunate enough to find employment on the Southern Section of the Persian Railway. In general they are not per mitted to work in Mazanderan on account oi its proximity to Soviet Russia. Refugees are not allowed to remain in Tehran, though some have managed to do so. These are fortunate in that they mostly succeed in obtaining work. 4 . The Persian authorities make capital out of the statement that num bers of G. P. U Agents are sent into Persia in the guise of refugees. This is generally speaking a gross exaggeration, it is not implied that this has never been done, but it is well established that all the serious work of the G. P. U. and the Comintein is conducted almost exclusively by the Soviet Trade Organizations, who by virtue of their position and official status are m an infinitely stronger position to travel throughout the country besides controlling funds for their work. The status of a refugee in any case is so bad that he could not hope to work without being discovered, since the slightest display of capital in his possession would certainly land him in the jail as a suspect. 5. A number of refugees have from time to time returned to Soviet Russia with the assistance of the Soviet Consulates. These in most cases are those wdic have been driven to desperation by continued unemployment or their treatment at the hands of the Persians. It is true that some, (gen erally youths) thoroughly embued with Communistic doctrines who ran away to Persia for a venture, return willingly to Bolshevism but the percent age is small. The Soviet Authorities make as much capital as possible out of every returning refugee to discredit the remainder. It is believed that a Secret Agreement exists between the Persian and Soviet Governments for the exchange of refugees from either country, it is definitely known that Russians have been kept in confinement in some cases for months both on the Frontier and also in Meshed, before being hand ed back to the Soviet Authorities. It is said that in such cases individuals have been detained until notification was received of some individual ‘‘wanted” by the Persians being captured, when an exchange is arranged. ( 120 ) Despatch from H. M.'s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 502-E., dated the 15th November 1934. With reference to my despatch No. 555 of November, 29th, last [S. No, (1441 in F. No. 80-N./33], I have the honour to transmit, herewith, a copy of the Annual Report* of the National Bank of Persia, submitted to the General Meeting held on the 10th Mehr, 1313 (2nd October, 1934), together with the balance sheet and profit and loss account of the Bank for the year 1312 (21st March 1933 to 20th March, 1934). Placed with originals.2 . The gross profits for the year 1312 were four million, seven hundred and twenty-two-thousand, six hundred and ninety-two Rials and ten dinars, compared with five million eight hundred and ninety-eight thousand, jthree hundred and sixty seven rials and ninety dinars last year. Net profit is given as two million, one hundred and fifty-eight thousand, seven hundred and eight Rials and ninety-five dinars, as against two million, three hundred and ninety-two thousand^ eight hundred and forty-nine Rials and seventy- live dinars last year. Distribution of the net profit is the same as before, namely, eighty per centum to the account of the Government in accordance with Article XXV of the Statutes, ten per centum to reserve funds, and ten per centum carried forward. 3. The Bank propose to apply during the current year for the elabora tion of new Statutes under which they would be enablea: (a) To acquire property abroad for their own or for Government pur poses and to establish branch offices abroad. (b) To fix the gold cover against bank notes at thirty three per centum. (c) To authorise the Bank, in accordance with its position as a note issuing Bank, to re-discount the bills of other Banks under special conditions. 4. It is also proposed to request the Government to pay the remaining sixty per centum of unpaid shares and to increase the authorised capital. The Government would be asked at the same time to pay a sum of five million, ninety-six thousand, two hundred and nine Rials and sixty-five dinars as in final contribution towards the expenses of the Bank during the first two years of its existence. 5. Other important proposals contained in the report are the definite adoption by Persia of the gold standard, and the organisation of a Bourse. 6 . I am reporting separately on the first part of the Bank’s report, which deals in a general way with the economic, financial and commercial situation of the country as a whole. 7.

British Consulate General, New York. 11th October, 1934. ( 122 ) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran,;, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 496, dated the 4th November, 1934. For what yon may decide to consider them to be worth, I record the following trivialities :— . -- A 2 Early last week I requested the C hs / du Pi otocole to arrange ail interview -for me with the Minister for, Foreign Affairs and also to tell tiis Excellency that I should be glad of an audience of the Shah m order to take leave. 3. Towards the end of the week Assad Ixhan..,Bahadur, on meeting Mr. Mallet at a party, made it unmistakably clear that the audience, for a variety of not very conclusive reasons, was a matter of some difficulty, and that in so far as an interview witL the Minister for Foreign Affair^ was concerned, he suggested—having failed to arrange one. himself—that I shpuld ring Kazemi up and say that I intended to see huh at a'given hour on a given day. 4 I conceived that the matter of the audience was one for your appre ciation and I therefore asked for your instructions in my telegram No. 146 of the 1st November. 5 . On the other hand, I was quite positive that His Majesty’s Minister was obliged to indicate that if he asked to see the Minister for Foreign Affairs he expected an answer. I, therefore, sent in yesterday the follow- ino- memorandum, which reached the Minister personally at about one p.m. :— ,, “His Britannic Majesty’s Minister has the honour to state that he informed His Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affaiis some days ago,, through the channel prescribed by the Imperial Government, that he wished to see His Excellency. “Sir It. Hoai;e will be glad to know whether His Excellency Kazemi received his message.” 6^ At about 2-45, p.m., the long-suffering Chej du Protocole telephoned to gay that (this is' a compression) Mr. Mallet had' entirely misunderstood and thai the ghaff wpujd be deligjited to receive me. Moreover, the Mjni§- ter iol Foreign Affairs would like to see me to-day at 10 a.m. A' Jttle later the Acting Head of the European Department telephoned to Mr. Trott to say that, of course. Bahadur had been told to ring me up before my memorandum reached the Minister,.7. I duly presented myself and was told by His Excellency how greatly he had enjoyed seeing you at Geneva and “Lord Eden” and “Mr. Vansittart”' in London; he had, in fact, had a series of utterly delightful and completely frank conversation with all his “friends”. I enquired whether he had dis cussed the treaty and was told that details had been eschewed, and so I proceeded to say that I should like to be in a position to inform my successor precisely what had happened to the treaty, and I observed that all the dis cussions which I had had with His Excellency about the Mudir incident at Basidu and the Evening Standard episode had throughout been based on the consideration that we were in agreement in wishing to get down to the Treaty negotiations as soon as possible. His Excellency appeared to me to concur, and I therefore went on to remind him that at my audience in December the Shah expressed the wish that the negotiations be resumed. His Excellency had shortly afterwards told me that he would like to re sume negotiations at an early date, but quite deliberately failed to do so. I should like to know why. 8 . Kazemi replied, with some signs of embarrassment, that a detailed examination of the papers left by Teymourtache showed that there was this and that in the previous discussions which the Persian Government found inacceptable; the treaty as previously discussed would not be a fair deal as between equals. I endeavoured to ascertain what the Persian Govern ment wanted, but failed to do so, but was told quite definitely that they did know precisely what they wanted. At about this stage in the conversation I expressed surprise at the Persian Government having failed during the many months (roughly ten) between the fall of Teymourtache and my return from leave in November or immediately after my audience in December, to formulate something definite. There was again an indication of emabrrass- ment and I obtained no enlightenment—the dossiers were very voluminous. 9. Feeling assured that there was nothing more that I could usefully say about the treaty, I moved on to Tamb and asked whether the Prime Minister had informed him of my note (see my despatch No. 443 of the 29th September last). The reply was in the affirmative. I asked why the Persian Government were so set on obtaining possession of Tamb and was told that it was nearer Persia than Arabia. I agreed that it was slightly nearer, but what of that? Apart from that, Kazemi said, Persia had always regarded Tamb as Persian. 10. I then asked whether HisrExcellency had had any political talks when he was at Baghdad on his return journey. He told me that he had had some conversations and that in general the outlook for an agreement was not good. I asked how it was that the agreement in principle reached when King Feisal was here had gone by the board and was told that “the man” (that is, Teymourtache) who had conducted the discussions had failed to in form the Shah of the real nature of the solution that he had in view, merely telling His Majesty that his wishes with regard to a settlement with Iraq would be fulfilled. 11 . In conclusion, I expressed an earnest hope that the Persian Govern ment would abandon the attempt to exclude officers from the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India from serving at certain of our Consulates in Persia. His Excellency’s demeanour was not reassuring. 12. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 228), to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 81) and to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 185). ( 123 ) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 498, dated the 14th November, 1934. With reference to your despatch No. 506 (E.-6468/1134/34) of October 25th last (*c/. S. No. 78), relative to the activities of Mr. C. C.

His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General forwards two copies of Des patch No. 139. dated the 24th October, 1934, addressed to His Majesty’s; Minister at Tehran. Enclosure to S. No. (124). Despatch from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Meshed, to Hts Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 139-A/13, dated the 24th October, 1934. I have the honour to record the following events connected with the visit of H. I. M. the Shah to Khorasan, and which extended from the lOth to the 16th October, 1934. 2. The Shah who had left Tehran hy motor car on the 8 th October was welcomed at the provincial boundary at Assadabad by the chief local offi cials, and after spending the nights of the 8 th and 9th October at Sharud and Sabzewar, reached Meshed on the 10t}i October according to programme. No “istiqbal” by’Consular Corps or worthies was .permitted. 3 . Wednesday, 10th October .—At about 4-30 p.m. H. I. M. reached a point about 3 miles from Meshed, and there inspected 5,600 artillery, cavalry, and infantry of the Eastern Army. He expressed his satisfaction with the parade. At 5-30 p.m. H. I. M. reached the Shrine of Imam Eeza, and was received with customary pomp and ceremony. The newly com pleted Tehran Avenue and approaches to the Shrine were densely crowded with sightseers and gaily decorated with flags and houses illuminated. After performing the pilgrimage and partaking of the ceremonial tea, he received the Chief Priests and officials and then entered his motor car to continue his journey to the mansion in the “West End” which had been arranged for his reception. The Royal Car, which was well lighted, pro ceeded at a slow speed and gave the clapping populace ample opportunity of seeing His Majesty. 3. Whilst passing the Consulate-General which opens on to the main Pahlevi Avenue H. M. appeared to be attracted bv the illuminations and decorations as he leant forward and seemed to bow to the company assembled on the pavement in front of the entrance door. As is customary no one was allowed on the first floors of buildings on the Royal route. At the entrance to his residence he was met by the local officials. The Directors of Customs and Revenue he greeted as Directors of Smugglers and Thieves respectively, and ordered the Representative of Justice to punish them for their sins. 4. Thursday, 11th October. — At 9-30 a.m. the Shah visited the Mili tary Cantonment in the new city “Shahr-i-Nau” to the west of the city and adjacent to his residence. Report has it that he expressed dissatisfactionwith the barracks newly constructed and under construction. His visit to the kitchens was also painful as he did not approve of the taste of the food 1 which was being cooked. The General Officer Commanding (General Iraj Khan) was reprimanded and cautioned. Later at 11 a.m. the Shah decided to view the only-just-completed Shrine Hospital. As only the main block was ready H. I. M. decided that he would not perform the long-planned opening ceremony. He was pleased with the look of the building which is immense and very imposing, but advised Asadi (Mutuwal Bashi) to start with only 65 beds and not the 300 planned. 5. Friday, 12th October ..—In the afternoon H. I. M. motored the 17 miles to Tons where, in the presence of the party of 40 odd Orientalists (who had arrived in Meshed the previous day), the 40 members of the Mejlis, Heads of Departments and the Consular Corps, he declared open the Memo rial Tomb of Firdausi, the Persian poet and historian who died 1,000 years ago. After this simple ceremony and an examination of the structure the Shah returned to Meshed. 6 . Saturday, 13th October .—lu the morning the Shah motored the 48 miles to his recently and very profitably acquired estate at Fariman on the Meshed-Herat road. He was accompanied by Asadi who pointed out the sights. After promising to endow a school for 250 boys in place of the one existing for 30, the Shah proceeded to exnmine the Band-i-Fariman, a colossal dam situated some 4 miles from the village. The title deeds of the estate were formally handed oyer by Asadi and the party returned to Meshed by 5 p.m. 7. Sunday, 14 th October .—In the evening His Majesty visited another only-j ust-finished edifice, the Shah pur Club and Theatre. (This building was built with money which remained over from the internationally sub scribed Kuchan Earthqauke Relief Fund of 1-929, and was until a week before the Shah’s arrival ornamented with a Red Lion and Sun of the Society of that name). H. E. Jam, Minister of Interior and recently Governor-General here was congratulated by H. M. on this work which Jam (so he says) initiated. Later H. I. M. visited the Shrine Boys School and an Exhibition of Khorassan products. These latter were excellently displayed in a local Cinema Hall and received well-merited praise. 8 . Monday, 15 th October .—The Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs (Faiz Mohamed Khan) accompanied by Sirdar Asadullah Khan, a brother of the ex-Amir Amanullah Khan who had arrived in Meshed from Afghani stan the previous evening, were reported to have been granted an audience by H. I. M. the Shah. The Afghan Ambassador at Tehran was also in the reception. 9. Tuesday 16th October .—Yesterday audience of Afghan Officials delayed H. I. M. departure till this morning. Accompanied by H. H. Feroughi (Premier) and H. E. Jam (Minister of Interior) and a number of members of the Mejlis the Royal Visitors left in their motors at 8-30 a m. for Kuchan and Bujnurd and Turkoman races. 10 . The general impression is that the Shah was really pleased with Meshed, its improvements and progress. His last visit was in November 1930 when his progress was accompanied by a series of punishments and explosions. 11 . There was a complete absence of ceremonial and troops did not even line the roads along which there were stationed Policemen at 50 yard intervals. On his morning excursions H. M. did not take any companions or escort. He congratulated Asadi (Mutuwalli Bashi), the Mayor, and the designer of the new Hospital on their excellent achievements. 12 Immediately His Majesty left Meshed work on roads and elsewhere ceased and a nearly finished main bridge remains untouched for a week now. 13 A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department under Endorsement No. 357-A/13.mu* IMJUXXWUKtMU B 8 M jmrnmmHmmmfmmmmsmBa 158 P, Z. 6859/1934, (Received 24 th November, 1924, with Political Secretary's Letter No. 45, dated 8th November, 1924.)

Baggallay, Esq. Employment of British Air Advisers in Persia. Mr H. M. Liddesdale, of 31, Kensington Court, W.- 8 , (who is, incidentally a cousin of Mr. Busk of His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran), called at the Foreign Office on 24th October in order to enquire about travel ling conditions between Baghdad and Tehran on behalf of the wife'of a friend. It transpired that the friend in question, whose name was Walker, was going out to Tehran in the employment of the Persian Government in order to assist in the re-organisation of the Persian Air Force. According to Mr. Lidderdale, he served as a R. A. F. officer dhring the war and more recently had some connexion with the development of Imperial Airways’ services in South Africa. He was leaving for Tehran fairly soon and had no illusions as to the difficulties attendant upon service under the Persian Government. Wing Command'er Pirie of the Air Ministry has since ascertained that the Persian Government recently asked the De Havilland Aircraft Company who are establishing in Persia a factory for the construction of Ardax and Moth aeroplanes, for an Englishman to take charge of this factory. The company, with the concurrence of Hawker Aircraft, chose Mr. Walker, Wing Commander Pirie understands that the appointment is not absolutely settled, but that there is little doubt of its going through. In any case, there is no question of a rival “mission” for the re-organisation of the Persian Air Force. ( 126 ) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 513, dated the 21st November, 1934. In continuation of Sir R.

( 127 ) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office;. London, No. 517-E., dated the 27th November, 1934. In Tehran despatch No. 502-E., of November 15th, paragraph 5 [S. No. ( 120 )], Sir P. Hoare had the honour to report the proposal put forward in the Annual Report of the National Bank for the adopting by Persia of the gold standard. 2. Colonel Amir Khosrovi, the managing director of the Bank., told the Commercial Secretary at a dinner party on November 18th, that the project for putting Persian currency on the gold standard had already been approv ed in principle and would shortly be submitted for the approval of the Majlis. Mr. Simmonds reminded him that Persia had already gone on to the gold standard twice but that nothing had happened. Colonel Khosrovi laughed and said that this time they meant business. Asked if he did not consider it somewhat rash for Persia to go on to gold at a time when there was a possibility that still more countries might abandon it, he replied that Persia was a small country with adequate financial resources, and he did not anticipate any special difficulties. With the price of silver recently as high as twenty-five pence an ounce, the normal exchange rate of rials against sterling would be about sixty-six, whereas his Bank had been making efforts to maintain an approximate rate of eighty. 3. In speaking of financial resources, Colonel Amir Khosrovi mention ed the figure of “un milliard” rials, or approximately twelve and a half million pounds at present rates of exchange. The cover against the note issue was reported, in Tehran despatch No. 434-E., of September 22nd [S. No. (113)], to consist of gold bars to the value of two hundred and eighty million rials, silver bars and coins four hundred and twenty-three million rials, and foreign exchange thirty-seven million rials—a total of seven hundred and forty million rials. This is two hundred and sixty million rials short of the “milliard” and one may therefore assume that this balance,, 162 C) r&amp;PD.representing approximately three and a quarter million pounds, consists of the total holdings abroad of the Persian Government This amount tallies approximately with the three million pounds hazarded in lehran despatch No. 361 of July 28th last. 4 . Colonel Khosrovi said that the project of the Bourse, also referred to in the Bank’s Annual Report, had likewise been approved, and that a buildin^ for this purpose would be erected in the Place lekieh, near the « met of four hundred thousand Tomans (about fifty-thousand pounds). 5 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade [No. 0. T. (B.) 200], to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 238), and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 86 ).

No special comment is called for in connection with the Summary, most of the features of which have been previously reported. The claim that the State receipts continue to show a surplus over expenditure is again made, but is not substantiated. In studying the figures of foreign trade given it must be recollected that the most important item, namely exports of mineral oil, is excluded, and that a real favourable balance is shown as a technical adverse balance. 3 .

Economic Situation in 1312. {Summary of introduction to report of National Bank of Persia for the year &lt; 131 ?.) \ The general situation has been affected by world depression, the fall in the value'of the dollar and pound, increasing tariffs, etc., Government stepped in to prevent discouragement of individual traders. Government action included public works (railways, roads, factories), establishment of commercial, industrial and banking institutions, direct and indirect subsidies to private enterprise, municipal development. Crops in 1312 were generally satisfactory and, being mainly for internal con sumption the country was spared some of the consequences of external fluctuations. The Bank has pursued a helpful policy but has had to be conservative owing to its recent establishment and lack of adequate reserves. Finance and Public Works. —Same banking and monetary conditions are claimed, State receipts always showing a large favourable balance mainlv devoted to financing public works. Expenditure on railway was Rials 239,945,775 and £66,506—say £3,066,000. Expenditure on roads was Rials 72,157,994 (about £900,000). The completion of a sugar factory at Kehrizak and a cement factory at Tehran, the beginning of a sugar factory at Shahi and the extension of State-owned mines are recorded.161 Foreign Trade. Imports (luring the economic year June 1933, to June 1934 amounted to 681,757,000 Kials (about £8,500,000) as compared with 611,665,000 Rials in the previous year. Exports were valued at 457,684,000 Rials (£5,700,000), against 522,040,916 Rials last year. The adverse balance thus increased from 89,624,084 Rials to 224,063,000 (about £2,300.000). Ihe size of the adverse balance is attributed partly to the falling off in exports but largely to the increase in imports for Government account, which rose from 133,169,271 rials last year to 243,957,027 rials (£3,000,000) in 1933-34. The diminution in exports is attributed to foreign exchange fluctuations and to the fall in the price of export certificates, as well as to world crisis. The foreign trade monopoly law, it is claimed, prevented an even steeper fail in exports. Import trade was affected by falling prices, first abroad and then in Persia. Import quotas were frequently larger than the real requirements of market. Merchants did not have real opportunities for satisfactory business. Remedies suggested a sound montetary policy minimising exchange fluc tuations; also administrative simplification of the foreign trade monopoly law, if necessary with abolition of import quotas but with maintenance of balanced trade as objective. In case of necessity the conclusion of barter or clearing arrangements with other countries. Better packing and sorting of Persian export produce. Necessity of creation of centre of rapid and exact economic information. (—presumably refers to proposed Bourse). FjXchange .—Repayment of Imperial Bank of Persia notes caused the latter Bank'to throw on the market large sums of foreign exchange to buy silver krans, thus increasing stocks of foreign exchange held by merchants. The price of silver also forced up the value of the rial. Value of rial was 5 per cent, above its metallic value; in 1311 it was 6 5 per cent, below. Exchange value of rial was affected only to a certain extent by price variations of silver and to a larger extent by speculation but the possibility of illegal export of silver rials and krans prevents exchange from falling far frPm silver parity. In order to avoid this passive subjection, the abandonment of the silver standard is advocated in order to retain monetary independence. Earge Government holdings of precious metals and foreign currency make a change possible. Money market.— The situation of the money market is described as “confused ’ owin&lt;* to lack of organisation as well as the abnormal commer cial situetion The need for an organized money market is stressed, as for a market for Treasury Bonds, a rediscounting system, and good class commercial bills signed by a Bank. The note circulation has con- tinueTto hicrease during^the year, and the cover in gold, silver and foreign currency is more than adequate. S.

I at the same time presented Sir R. Hoare s Letters of Recall. •2 The few minutes of conversation which I was able to have with His imperial Maiesty consisted mainly of generalities. I thanked him for the courtesy shown to me at the frontier and on my arrival and expressed interest in the iourney and admiration for the work which is being done in improving the capital. I also said that I had been greatly impressed with the variety and quality of the Persian products on view in the industrial exhibition recently opened in Tehran by the Shah. His Majesty, who had by then somewhat relaxed from his initial stiffness of demeanour answered that the Exhibition was a permanent institution and that the exhibits would be renewed from time to time, “especially the fish . 3 . I was able to give His Majesty an opening to say something about the relations between the two countries. He assured me of the fnendly feelings which he entertained for Great Britain I replied that the friendship of Great Britain for Persia had frequently been expressed in the past and that I was convinced that the mutual friendship of our two countries was essential to both. His Majesty reciprocated this sentiment and I said I should remember what he said. That sentiment would form the basis of my work here : there would be inevitable difficulties, but I should be perfectly frank and not hesitate to say at once when any ques ion was raised on which I could not meet the Persian point of view, ^v.e\er much the Persian Government and I myself might regret it. m aj spy seemed to appreciate this statement and I followed it up by expiessmg the hope that I might feel that I should from time to time be allowed to come anH talk matters over with His Majesty. To this the Shah replied T amalways here”! an answer which, though perhaps not warmly encouraging, mav be worth bearing in mind. ' 4 I then presented the Staff of His Majesty’s Legation and a few more- minutes conversation took place, ending with a loud burst of laughter on th part of His Imperial Majesty, who then withdrew. 5 .

I felt it wore seemly not to trespass in the field of learning and to leave to Sir Denison Ross and Mr. Drinkwater the task of representing British scholar ship and letters, which they admirably fulfilled. As the speeches by the forty-five delegates were made in alphabetical order, it fell to Sir Denison to speak on the last day of the Congress, when he presented the Turner Macan edition of the “Shahnameh” suitably inscribed as the gift of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to the Persian Government and made a short speech of congratulations, in the course of which he delivered to the Congress, in accordance with your instructions, the greetings and good wishes of His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Drinkwater had, on a previous day, recited amid much applause a poem which he had composed on the journey. The next day, to everybody’s delight, the Persian poet laureate read out a version of this poem in Persian verse which he had written during the night. The Acting Minister of Education, in closing the Congress, made a speech in English in which he gave due - credit to the work of British scholars of the nineteenth Century in popularising and translating the “Shahnatneh”. 4. The survivours of this orgy of hospitality left on October 10 th for Meshed, several of the more infirm having firmly resisted the temptation six days’ motoring over Persian roads, even if the prize were to be the spectacle of the Shah himself unveiling the memorial over the poet’s tomb at Tus. Incidentally, I hear that the learned men were a good deal hurt at not having been received by His Majesty at Tehran. 5 . The very elaborate and expensive arrangements made by the Persian authorities on the five hundred and fifty miles of road from Tehran to Meshed resulted in the safe arrival at the latter place of all the orientalists ■who started, including professor Minorsky, Mr. Drinkwater, Dastoor Nosherawan (a Parsi High Priest from Poona), Dr. Unvala, and one or two Indian scholars. Powerful cars performed the tedious journey in three stages. A special visit was made to the recently constructed monument erected over the supposed site of the grave of Omar Khayyam near Nishapur. This monument consists of an obelisk some twelve feet high, on a platfoim approached by stonesteps; it is carved in an elegant shape and bears eight of Omar’s best known quatrains incised in Persian, the letters being blackened 'with a view to increased legibility. Part of one of the eoi ners of the obelisk had already fallen off (unless indeed the carver s hand ha&lt; slipped when it was hastily .prepared a few months ago) and some °i tae letters were already beginning to disappear; the stone employed, m ac , appears to have been very soft. The monument itself is dwarfed \ huge 'aiwari or platform of the shrine by its side, erected m e une^o Shah Tahmasp in celebration of an obscure re ative of Imam Rizan who, as the guardian of the shrine was ready to explain to even one who ask , was burned alive for incestuous intercourse with his daughter. ^ the earden in which these two memorials are contained was a, peac ful a ^ beautiful enclosure in the best Persian tradition, severa ,162(C) F&amp;PD.165 A ^ who they were; but on hearing that they were the heads of ^ j ep ” t ' intc hp turned away with a gesture of impatience.

Enclosure 1 in Serial No. (133). Despatch from H. M.’s Consul at Tabriz, to H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, No. 7-Confidential, dated the 22nd January 1934. I have the honour to report that, following upon the closure of the American schools at Rezaieh, the Ministry of Education has now directed its attention to the Armenian shools of Tabriz—in this case no doubt on its own initiative entirely. , About the 10 th January orders were received from Tehran that the twT&gt; elementary schools were to adopt exactly the same programme as the Persian schools. 2 . Ihis order was at first communicated verbally at an interview to which the two school directors were summoned. The chief of police, who was also present, apparently attempted to modify the abruptness of the order by saying that a progressive change in their curriculum should be made. 3. The school directors appealed to their agreement made with the present Minister of Education’s predecessor, under which extra Persian lessons had been introduced. iu uiis it was r —- -- . r~ -~r v ^cement maae witn a tormer Minister was superseded by the present definite instructions. ; The directors replied that they must consult their boards of control. 4 The interview terminated, but next day the two schools received omciai letters ordaining, among other things— (a) They must entirely conform to the official schedules for education. &gt;■ Special attention must be paid to the Persian language, history and geography. not j (c) No foreign language is to be taught in the elementary shools.

The actual reply made was that the Russians had closed the school temporarily and the “the consul-general was in touch with the Governor- General and Tehran about the.matter.” Enclosure 3 in Serial No. (133). j Despatch from H. M.’s Consul, Tabriz, to H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, No. 21, DATED THE 1ST MARCH 1934. In continuation of my despatches Nos. 7 and 10 , I have the honour to report that the Persianisation of all elementary schools is being proceeded v ith most vigorously, while further limitations are being enforced upon the non -1 ersian high schools, which had been left more or less unaffected previously. I 1 . After the order of the Education Department to the American boys’ school that all pupi* 1 .s not having certificates from a Persian elementary school could not remain in that school (vide Tabriz Diary No. 1 for 1934), the American girls’ school received a similar order in the first Week of Feb ruary and at once dismissed all the Armenian and Assyrian (a few) girls, thirty-two girls in all. Only a very few of these girls can pass the Persian examinations required, so that a few have asked to be allowed to enter a Persian girls’ school. But the great majority are uncertain what to do. Only Persian girls now remain in this American girls’ school. The majority.of the boys who were dismissed from the American boys’ school are frequenting the Persian “Najat” elementary school with a view to passing ilie needed examinations, receiving certificates, and re-entering the American school at the beginning of the next scholastic year (in Sep tember). The rest have abandoned all idea of completing their education. 2 . The Russian school was definitely informed that they must not take Persian pupils. To .this the Russians finally agreed, and transferred their school to the old consulate-general building (as already reported). Since then the Director of Education occasionally sends someone or goes himself to find out whether they really have no more Persian pupils. The Russian school, is now reduced to 43 pupils, and as each class was reduced to 4 — 6—8 pupils, and the 2 upper classes to 2 pupils each only, they have now reduced their .teachers to 8 . Under these circumstances, it is not yet certain whether the Russians will open their school at all next year. #170 3. The question of the Armenian mixed boys’ and girls’ schools is by no means settled yet. . ~ , After the refusal of the local boards to accept the Government educa tional plan in its entirety (as already reported), rumours reached here from Tehran that the Ministry of Education had consented to allow these schools to have three lessons in Persian and three m Armenian a day. But on the 17th February the Education Department wrote very curtly to the Tabriz Armenian schools (and this time to the Cenral School also, vh ch had so tar escaped attention) to say that ‘the Armenian school of Tehran had already accepted the plan in its entirety and that Aey had o do the same. In the case of further refusals, the letter added they would be obliged to take the necessary repressive measures, as instiucted by the Ministry.” ' , , . . t&lt; , Upon receipt of this ultimatum the boards of the three schools and the Assembly of the Representatives of the Azerbaijan P 10 c e se he d a 3^ in meeting ^on the IMh , and, in view of the fact that the Tehran school had accepted the plan, and that the schools at Resht etc., were forced to close following theR refusals, the meeting decided, after much discussion and despite a strong opposition element, to choose the lesser evil and accept the On the 20th February two members of each of the boards of the three l .nd ,h. .hook « toht, etc **&gt;», takings to adopt the plan in their respective schools in the form of the engagement given by the Tehran school, viz .. ‘ We undertake to adopt the Government educational plan in our schools, but would ask to be permitted to have a few extra lessons besides those allowed to replace lessons m the Koran and ‘Shariat Law’, in order to teach the Armenian langauge and religion.” It was hoped that, as this formula of the undertaking was prepared by the Ministry of Education, they will at least allow a few lessons per week for the Armenian language and religion. The Armenians proposed to introduce the plan in September, but this does not satisfy the Education Department. On the 27th February the inspector of the Education Department visited the schools, asked why Armenian text-books and maips were still m evidence, and ordered their immediate introducton of the plan under pain of closure at once. As, however, the Armenian Deputy telegraphed that the director should be informed that the new curriculum for the Armenian schools being sent down from Tehran—and that this was to be applied forty nay after receipt—the director finally agreed to let things stand till - Nov ™ z _ No one here, however, knows the exact terms of the curriculum, whic the Deputy has hinted at without definitely stating. 4 The Russians, following upon the return of their “Vice-Consul Emidadze from Tiflis, have been approaching “neutral” Armenians as w as the Opposition, and taunted the Dashnag party to them as cowards wi abandoned all their national and linguistic aspirations to save , their skins.” Emidadz 6 is rumoured to have brought back an authority lor Armenians who desired to do so to emigrate to Soviet Armenia. The pro-Dashnag Armenians are now protesting^ to the Director o Public Security that this attitude of F.midarlze and his satellites is pro cative and likely to lead to a bceach of the peace. 5. It will be perhaps interesting to add here that the entile Armenian population of Azerbaijan is estimated to be about 20.000 persons c centrated chiefly in Tabriz, Rezaieh, Maragha, Ardabil, but wlth , ov 0 e , r ; 1 r ,,, r purelv Armenian villages (chiefly in the Kara-Dagh. and around bhanp a ml Rezaieh). They have seven schools in the town and twenty in dineieuJ 71 villages (last year thei]e were about ten more village schools), with about 2 5‘&gt;0 pupils oi both sexes), of which number 1 ,200 are in Tabriz. There are about seventy teachers and directors. The entire expenses of these schools are supported by the local' Armenians, who are generally in poor financial circumstances. It can be said that almost all these twenty-seven schools are financed through the heavy financial sacrifices of the Tabriz Armenians, who number about 9,000 persons, and who also are mostlv in poor financial circumstances. 6 . .But apart from the loss of freedom to teach their mother tongue, as desired, there is another matter which is very important for the A zerbaijan Armenians. Unlike Tehran, Ac., there ar,e practically no Armenian teachers who know much Persian; and as, according to the regulation of the Ministry of Education, all school directors and teachers °must have Per nan edneation and diplomas, none of the actual directors or teachers of these se\en town and twenty village schools can be allowed to remain if the Education Department insist upon these details. d'he many teachers and directors needed can scarcely be found among even the Armenians of Tehran, so that, in fact, many of these schools would in future be staffed by Persians. If this condition is insisted upon, it seems doubtful whether; the schools can continue, as Armenians would scarcelv send their boys and certainly not their girls, to any Persian-staffed schools! P.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 482, dated the 2nd November, 1934. With reference to my despatch No. 197 of the 19th April last, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a further despatch from His Majesty’s consul at Tabriz regarding the difficulties of Armenian schools in Azerbaijan. 2. The general attitude of the Persian Government at present is that no foreign school can be allowed 1 to bear the name of a foreign country. Such names as “American College” or “English Girls’ School” will there fore no longer be tolerated. In accordance with this standpoint, the educa tional authorities lately issued a circular laying down that, in future, Armenian, American and Israelite Alliance schools, established in Persia for the benefit of Persian subjects, must possess suitable names, such as those of historical characters or abstract qualities. The latter category was subsequently defined as including such virtues as “Politeness,” “Honesty” and “Truth.” These instructions were explicitly stated not to apply to the French schools, since these all bear such names as St. Louis or Jeanne d’Arc. 3. Remarkably enough this order was enforced in the provinces before it was brought to the notice of the foreign schools in the capital, and the American schools at Resht and Hamadan found themselves faced with the necessity of choosing new names within about twenty-four hours. Acting quite independently, they both selected the name of “Avicenna,” a famous Persian physician, and it is now possible that the same name will bd adopted by all the American missionary institutions in Persia. While there is, however, a certain advantage in the new name having the same initial letter as the old, some of the American authorities object to the idea of their schools hearing the name of a Moslem. 162(C) F&amp;.PD.172 4 While the above-mentioned circular omits all references to English schools' I understand that difficulties are arising over the name 'Stuart Memorial College” at Isfahan, though it still appears possible that the Persian authorities there may be persuaded to agree to the retention of the name. At any rate, the matteij does not appear to be urgent and the college is not worrying over it unduly. I believe, however, that the girls schools at Yezd and Kerman are usually known by the name 'English School,” in which case new appellations will presumably have to be devised. 5 . I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty s consul at Tabriz (No. 24). ( 134 ) Despatch from Hits Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 552-E., dated the 15th December, 1934. I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a translation of a new law abrogating the registration tax on vehicles of 12th Farvardine 1309 ( 1 st April 1930), and imposing a tax on paraffin and petrol. 2. The law was passed by the Majlis with double urgency on the 6 th December after a slight discussion during which Mr. Rahnema, the editor of the “Iran”, suggested that some thought might be given to the majority of the people who use paraffin and that the tax on this commodity should be slightly reduced and that on petrol increased. The Minister of Finance, after explaining that villagers used little paraffin as locally produced oil was generally used for lighting purposes, terminated his reply in support of his bill with the following words (taken from 'Le Messager de Teheran” of 7th December) :— 'Mais, concernant les habitants des villes, on peut dire que tous sont obliges de bruler pet role, meme s’ils disposent de I’electrj- cite, dont la prochaine extension dans la Capitale r&amp;iuira les recettes provenant de la presente loi. Par consequent, I’emploi du p^trole dans les villes est general, chacun pouvant en user autant qu’il desire, et s’il trnuve qu’il lui revient tres cher, ils n’ont qu’a se coucher un peu plus tot, ce qui sera tres avantageux pour I’etat general de leur sant 6 et non sans grande utilite, du point de vue des yeux. . .” Hilarity generale. 3. The law imposes a tax of dinars twenty (about point six of a penny) per litre, or Rials three and dinars sixty (ten pence and three farthings) per tour gallon tin, the usual size in Persia. Prices previously were about rials nineteen (four shillings and nine pence) for petrol, and about rials eleven and dinars seventy-fiye (two shillings and eleven pence) for paraffin per tin. It is obvious therefore that the latter is more heavily taxed when the price is taken into consideration. According to the Minister of Finance the annual consumption in Persia of petrol amounted to some ten million batmans (say about six million, six hundred thousand gallons) and of paraffin double the quantity. Taking a batman approximately at three litres, the total revenue would amount to about eighteen million rials (two hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds). It is practically impossible to calculate the revenue previously collected from motor vehicles as accurate figures of registration are unobtainable. Moreover, numerous cars and lor ries have hitherto been taken off the road during the winter months in order that payments of the monthlv tax might be avoided. The tax on vehicles was also difficult to collect and necessitated the employment of a considerable number of officiate. 4. 'Owners of private cars benefit considerable under the new law as they nou no longer pay the old tax of rials one hundred (sav one pound five shillings) a month whether their care were powerful S evS- motors or cheap four cylinder models. Lorries and buses are,* however.173 70^ adversely affected, as the following figures supplied by Mr. Binns of Messrs., Leylands, Limited, * Tehran, show :— Oid tai per Estimated extra month. monthly expenditure now. Lorries up to 5 tons . • Lorries over 5 tons , . Buses and passenger carrying lorries • Rials 90 Rials 375 • t) 70 „ 600/650 t 150 „ 375 5. The extra expenditure is based on a monthly mileage of about six thousand kilometres, and a consumption of two hundred tins of four gallons, which may be taken as fairly accurate as regards heavy lorries, but the consumption for light lorries and buses would probably be less. &gt;. 6 . 1 am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade [No. 0.

Ministre des Finances. (135) {Received on 23rd December 1934, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 40, dated 6th December 1934.) P. Z. 7409/1934. (Enclo. in Foreign Office Despatch No. E -6966/40/34, dated November 19, 1934.) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office. London, No. 485, dated the 3rd November 1934. I have the honour to report that the oriental secretary recently received a visit from an old friend who had spent the previous ten months in prison in Tehran under suspicion of complicity in the alleged Bakhtiari “plot.” He gave Mr. Trott a rough account of his experiences during his incarcera tion. 2 . He had been asked a great number of questions, the motive being to discover what dealings he had had with the Bakhtiaris. He was ques tioned as to his relations with Major Bremner. with Mr. Trott, with the Italian Mountaineering Expedition and with Sardar Assad. He replied to these questions in a negative manner, stating that he knew nothing about Major Bremner and that his relations with the Italians had been purelv as a, guide. He was also questioned about relations between the Anglo- Persian Oil Company and the Bakhtiari khans. 3. The khans are for the most part in the No. 2 division of the Tamin’at prison. They are not badly looked after, though they are kept separate. Amir Hussein Khan and Amir Jang, however, are still kept in No. 1 cells, which are darker and even damper than the No. 2. Sardar Bahadur is at Qasr-i-Qajar. The unfortunate Rashidi is in a No. 2 cell; it appears that he is suffering from rheumatism and it is probable that he will not long survive. Mr. Trott’s informant was surprised how well he was treated. He had his regular food and even cigarettes. His great difficulty was the cdmplete absence of a bath; he had no bath during the whole period of the ten months and the cells were, moreover, swarming with vermin. He formed the impression that his interrogators themselves were in the dark as to what they were trying to find out. They asked him the same questions time and time again. Some, he knew, had resigned or had at least tried to. but their resignations were never accepted. He paid tribute to the kindness shown him by General Ayrom, but stated that he did not believe that he could very long continue to hold his position. 4. He stated that in his opinion the origins of the accusation against the Bakhtiaris sprang from some intrigues by one of the wives of Sardar Bahadur. Nothing was ever discovered about any plot for the simple reason that there was no plot. The scheme no doubt was to confiscate all the khans’ property. ; 5. Mr. Trott s visitor stated that a continuous stream of prisoners came into the prison while he was there. One was accused of forming a plot against the Shah, but was eventually released, another was a man who owned property worth 30,000 tomans in Mazanderan; he was pressed by the Shah to sell for 2,000. 1 his he countered by begging the Shah to take it for nothing. In such cases the victim is imprisoned until he agrees to £ign for the Shah’s price.175 r 6 . Mr. Trott was also told that the Shah now supplies 80 per cent, of the army s requirements, not only grain, rice, etc., but also boots and clothing. Ihe Royal fortune must be accumulating like a snowball. 7. The two army leaders who appear to have the most influence now are Sepahbod Ahmad Agha and Amanullah Mirza, but the focus of any discontent was more likely to be somebody outside Persia, perhaps Taqizadeh, who, as I have reported elsewhere, has given various indications of his intention not to return to Persia. 8 . To the accidental mind it would appear inevitable that after years of oppression such as is recorded above, the Persian worm would eventually turn, but it must be remembered that this oppression is not a new thing in Persia, and I think it moist unlikely that there will be any open resistance to the regime at least until after the death of the Shah. Money is being poured out everywhere on schemes which are providing employment; the army is well fed and the officers, at least, well treated; and the peasants on His Majesty’s estates are probably better off than they were previously, while other peasants are not much worse off than they have been for many years past. The discontent of the few remaining big landowners is unlikely to find open expression. It must be remembered that they probably obtained their ancestral lands by much the same methods as the Shah, but, of course, on a smaller scale. Finally, I believe there exists among the working classes a certain real pride in the Shah’s achievements. The necessities of life cost them more, but they are conscious of being ruled by a strong man, and it is preferable to be oppressed by a strong man than by petty landowners lording it under a weak Shah.

Hoare’s despatch No. 590, of December 20th, 1933 [S. No. (4)], I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of a law, passed by the Majlis on December 15th, amending the Income Tax Law of November 20th 1933. 2. By the new law, the minimum of taxable income is reduced from five thousand rials (sixty-two pounds and ten shillings approximately) to two thousand four hundred rials (thirty pounds) per annum. The rates of taxes on incomes between ifive thousand rials and twenty thousand rials are somewhat reduced, but those on incomes between fifty thousand rials and one hundred thousand rials are increased by one half of one per cent. 3. Employees on small salaries and even domestic servants will now become liable to income tax for the first time. In their urgent need of funds the Persian authorities are inflicting very heavy burdens on the poorer classes, who have long had to bear the burnt off the heavy taxes on sugar and tea (to provide funds for railway construction), and who have recently been saddled with additional charges in respect of the tax on paraffin and the increased cosE of cotton piece goods resulting from the recent establishment of an import monopoly of those goods. 4.

Article 1 .—A tax will be levied, in cases where the annual income exceeds 2,400 rials, on the total net income of persons affected by the most recent Income Tax Law of Aban 29th, 1312 (November 20th, 1933), at the undermentioned rates:— 2, tOO-5,000 rials, 1 per cent, of the total. 5,001-10,000 „ IJ per cent, of the total. 10,001-20,000 „ 2 per cent, of the total. 20,001-30,000 „ 3 per cent, of the total. 30,001-50,000 „ 3| por cent, of the total. 50,001 and upwards 4 per cent, of the total.

The previous tax on land was at the rate of three ajnd a half per cent, of all revenue accruing from landed property. This tax was no doubt subject to arbitrary assessment, led to undue hardship and peculation, and required a large staff of revenue officers for its collection. By the new law property which is unprofitable or unproductive will gain relief. The very extensive estates of the Shah will incidentally (or, more probably, express ly) be relieved from heavy taxation assessments and will only pay the tax on actual produce. 3.

The following curious story has just come to my notice: it may possibly be a symptom of the dissatisfaction which must exist somewhere in Persia, and may even presage more serious disorders to come. I there fore have the honour to bring it to your notice. 2 . For some time past the students at the school of medidine, which is supervised by the Ministry of Public Instruction and is directed by a Persian doctor named Dr. Bakhtlar, have been inclined to show their dissatis faction at the teaching and methods of their director. Dr. Bakhtiar, an uncouth but energetic man, has worked himself up by prodigious efforts from a very humble origin, and has been through a full medical education in America, he holds strong views on the desirability of hard work and thorough training. , iV 3. The usual course of medical training at the Persian School of Medicine has hitherto lasted .five years. Dr. Bakhtiar holds the opinion that an extra year is necessary. Without submitting his proposal to either the students or the faculty of medicine, he, by direct but irregular methods, succeeded in obtaining the consent of the “Shora” ( the High Council of Public Instruction) to his proposal for the sixth year. This meant that those students who were just completing their fifth year, and were lookfmg forward to earning money through regular practice, suddenly found that they were obliged to support themselves for another year. 4 . The dissaticfaction came to a head about ten days ago. Pickets had been placed outside the medical school with a view to stopping the students from attending any classes therein. Dr. Bakhtiar, after consult ing with the Inspector-General of the Ministry of Public Instruction, sent for the poPice and instructed them to put the picketers in prison. r Jhe police carried out these instructions. 5 . A crowd of students then beseiged the Ministry and the Acting Minister, Mirza Ali Asghar Khan Hikmat, came out and delivered a speech on the steps of the building of the Ministry. The inspector-general was dismissed, the five years’ course was reinstated, the prisoners were released, and Dr. Bakhtiar’s classes were, it is believed, discontinued. The students, having taken the opportunity of smashing the windscreen of Dr. Bakhtiar’s car and taking off all four wheels and throwing them in the gutter, dispersed. / , _ ^ v 6 . Hikmat, incidentally, made another change. Dr. Blair, of the American Mission Hospital, had been giving anatomy lectures—another of the innovations of Dr. Bakhtiar. The lectures were not very successful, in the absence of corpses; the size of the class, which numbered 200 was also an obstacle to proper teaching. Hikmat announced that the classes were to be discontinued. The fear that the clergy of Tehran, whose dislike of such irreligious activities as surgery is intense though at present ^inarti culate, might cause trouble is said to have been one reason for Hikmat s decision in this matter. The result of this shrewd stroke is that Hikmat s position is a little stronger, the students are satisfied with less to do, Dr. Blair is relieved oif an irksome duty, and the present batch of young Persian doctors will know nothing abdut anatomy. 7 The students have now returned to their studies. Some think that the ringleaders will eventually learn that the authorities will have the means of getting their own back by dealing wkth the recalcitrants singly, when the effect of their victory has evaporated. As I write, I also hear that there is no real intention to rescind the dedision to have a six years course instead of five. Whatever the truth of this odd affair is, it is certain that young Persia has, at last, shown a certain tendency to rebe against arbitrary imprisonment. 52, ( 142 ) P. 2.-7833/34.

' Consul Summerhayes to Sir R. Hoare. (No. 60.) Kermanshah, October 25, 19 34 ., (Sir, I have the honour to report that on the 23rd instant I travelled back here alone the new pipe-line of the Anglo-Peraian Oil Comyany from Naft-i- Shah, and I give below some account of the project in amplification of details given from time to time in diaries. 2 . At Naft-i-Shah a sufficient volume of oil for all probable require ments is assured from the existing well with a depth of about 2,000 feet. Two other wells are being drilled close by, of which one is wanted as subsidiary for the main supply and the other is needed for taking back the unnecessary crude oil. As there is no market tin Persia for the heaviest oil products, the first distilling or topping is to be done at Naft-i-Shah before the oil is pumped up the line and the rough fuel oil will be pumped back down the third well. 3. The work there is still mainly controlled from the Naft-Khaneh field, 4 miles away across the Iraqi frontier. Though the Persians have recently complicated this control by insisting on the cutting of the previous telephone line between I\aft-Khaneh and Nadt-i-Shah, the new work is given some special facilities, and the Persian police and customs officials, both at Naft-i-Shah and at Khosrovi, on the main road, cause much less difficulty than they do in other places where the company works. When the construction work at Naft-i-Shah is finished the traffic between the two fields may be more restricted. 4. The frontier between ^Naft-Khaneh and Naft-i-Shah is fortunately well marked by the stream Ab-i-Naft, yet two of the wells on the Iraqi side are so close to this stream that it is planned to drill others at a comfortable distance. Fuither to the north, on its way towards Qasr-i-Shirin. the pipe runs very near to a less clearly defined' frontier and after the first road had been roughly made for the work it was found that it touched Iraqi territory and a change had to be made. 5. Naft-i-Shah is the property of the Shah, and he is, of course, parti- cu ar y interested in the project. The attitude of the authorities has there- ore, been generally helpful all along the line, and, between this and the care shown by the company s staff, the work has gone smoothly and quicklv. Ills Majesty acquired some years ago all the area around the Naft-i-Shah, where the Kalher tribe, since renamed the Bavandpur, used to spend the co d seasons only. It is a barren district, but it is planned to make quite a township at Naft-i-Shah and to make the tribespeople settle then- and over the now deserted country to Qasr-i-Shirin. . 1 he pumping station at Naft-i-Shah will boost the oil along the 3-inch pipe to the next pump near Qasr-i-Shirin, a distance of over 40 miles. e trench is ready there and the welding work is being hurried on now before the winter from the well end to meet at Pai-Taq tlie pipe, which is now finished, from there to Kermanshah. 4 P F fron/tlm wpl 7 ro ^ ^ as . ^ een ma de along this undulating country P^i/n J0 ' n k tl ri main 1:03(1 at Q asr -i-Shirin.

The third pumping 1 statfon is under181 construction on the lower slopes of'the Pai-Taq Pass, and the fourth and last is also nearing completion about 2 miles west of Shahabad. At the top of the Pai-Taq Pass, 5,500 feet, the pipe will be at its highest point. None of the pumping stations along the line are close to any towns. These stations and the pipe are expected to be completed this winter, but the refinery at Kermanshah will not be opened till next June. 9. Along the main road I saw, as is now usual, very few lorries carry ing anything but petrol up-country, and those in the opposite direction were nearly all empty. Unless general trade improves and the policy of starving this road is abandoned, it is likely to be very empty when the pipe line starts working and, if the company distributes from Kermanshah in bulk to tanks at all important centres in northern Persia, the important transport trade at Kermanshah will be very seriously affected: As an offset, only a small number of local employees will be needed when the refinery here is organised, and much money will not be spent here. People in this area are, however, being usefully reminded again of the efficiency of British men and material. 10 . A copy of this despatch is being sent to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad.

(Enclosure in Foreign Office, letter No. E. 675611329134, dated the 6 th November 1933.) P.Z. 7953{33. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 491, dated the 20th October 1933. Recent events in the Persian Gulf have unfortunatelv once more shown how wide a divergence of view exists almost inevitably between those members of His Majesty’s services whose duty it is to watch events in Persia from the different angles of Tehran and the Gulf ports. It is useless to ignore the fact that this divergence exists, but it may be of use to attempt to examine the reason for it and to search for the means of greater harmony in the future. 2. The difference of view is due partly to training and partlv to environ ment. As regards the former, the diplomatic staff at Tehran has usually no experience of the administration of oriental peoples which forms part of the training of officers of the Indian Political Service. Its members are accustomed to treat with officials of foreign Governments on terms of at least outward and nominal equality. Diplomacy knows of no subject races ; it must not openly admit the existence of racial or colour prejudice ; it cannot ignore the framework of the League of Nations within which its post-war activities are confined, where all nations are equal under the Covenant. 3. As regards environment, we at Tehran have to deal with a Persian Government admittedly below that level of civilisation to which a diplomat is accustomed, though perhaps no lower than that of some of the Central and South American republics. Nevertheless, to us the Minister for Foreign Affairs represents the Persian Government, just as you, Sir, are His Majesty’s Government, as far as the Persian Legation is concerned. The decencies and courtesies of diplomatic intercourse have to be observed punctiliously. The diplomatic missions play the game of diplomacy, with its social round and official decorum, as far as possible unaffected by the fact that they are living in a country still barely outside the confines of barbary. 4. In the Persian Gulf, however, life still goes on rather in the old way, far from Tehran and its new streets and new methods of government, but near the waters in which the British navy has held unchallenged supremacy for more than a century. The Gulf is still, in fact, to some degree an apanage of our Indian Empire, and the Political Resident is the visible sign of that Empire’s grip on the Gulf. He still enjoys that halo of prestige which comes of the proximity of armed force. The halo has become less conspicuous of late—like a Titian halo to that of a Fra Angelico—but it is still rather nebulously there. At Tehran, however, we discarded halos about the time the Persians took to Pahlavi hats. For instance, our escort of sowars has gone ; I would not wish for it back. It used to impress the Persians ; it would now merely irritate them as a bygone relic of “ imperialism ”. For the modern Persian who has travelled abroad realises how people—even how diplomats—behave in European countries. Infected by the Turkish bacillus, he wishes to be treated as an occidental. To treat him as an Indian is a deadly insult. 5. So we pretend that the Persian is an occidental, and we try to play the game of diplomacy according to the rules of the Congress of Vienna. V e have, in fact, given up the idea that you can bluff and bully the modern Persian. Perhaps we have leamt much from the Soviet Government in this respect. The Russians succeeded in the past by ignoring colour prejudice. We may succeed in the future by pretending to an Aryan kinship which Hitler would certainly not willingly claim. r—LsSOOi’D — —t A2 d In the eyes of many people this post-war policy of playing up to Persian vanity is despicable and wrong. If it is, the excuse for it must be that it was at least inevitable. Our military prestige—greater than ever before in our history at the armistice—dwindled quickly enough as our legions withdrew from the confines of Russia and our improvised fleet from the Caspian ; it vanished on the day of the surrender at Enzeli. The prestige of West over East, on which Britain’s strength in oriental countries so largely rested, had already been rudelv shaken in the Islamic world when the Christian nations embarked in the World War with all its barbarous consequences. 7 . New Persia has no use for foreigners, who claim a special position. She has still, however, need for friends. The Shah himself probably knows this well enough. He will never make friends with the Soviet Government. To whom, then, must he turn ? 8 . Yet, though we have helped him greatly since he came to the throne, our help has been passive rather than active. We have waited to have successive concessions wrung from us. We have given way, always a little too late, over tariffs and Capitulations ; we have shown no marked enthusiasm at Persia’s military progress, at her attempts to create a navy and an air force. Our gifts have been grudgingly given and accepted without gratitude. 9. Meanwhile, Persia has acquired self-confidence. She is, in her own eves, quite a military Power. She is a member of the League, no doubt considered' quite a personage by the smaller Powers represented at Geneva. This admission into wider social circles has brought her a host of new diplomatic missions to Tehran, whose only utility seems to be to flatter Persian vanity. Best of all, Persia now feels that if either of the big neighbours tries to browbeat her there is a hope of salvation by appealing to the sympathy of the smaller nations at Geneva, who are jealous of the preponderant influence of the greater Powers. 10 . An event in the Gulf, such as the flag incident at Basidu, is rightly examined by the Political Resident and his subordinates from the dual point of view of its effect upon Persian and Arab opinion. Admittedly it is of importance that the Arab rulers should not become unsettled. But it is of no special importance, as far as our Persian policy is concerned, whether the Persian dwellers on the northern shores of the Gulf are impressed or the reverse by the action or inaction of His Majesty’s ships. What matters in Persia is the effect on the bhah. He is it is true, remote from the Gulf, but his writ does definitely inn throughout his kingdom He is too remote to be alarmed at anything our hC il f ° rt , °/ a dof ” llte act of but he is just near enough W™™ Ak” 18 ' te l- and furi0 ' s k *!' 8ry - “ Teaching the Persians a sharp “ ' a K ' fertmg our authority ”, may help materially in bringing to same effect n p 14 ^ aCr0SS th , e waler ’ b,,t does not have at all the ev^r tWe l An l ah ' 11 may T^ ly resnlt in the disappearance of what ever friendly Ministers may surround him at the time and their replacement by Rnssinn 0 ' 1 t0 a S alnst Great Britain, and therefore ready to plav the bi Pmdm^lT't If m T y la , oaas , that the next spinning mill will hot be’ordered but from foreign factories. ^ aero l ,Ianes win not come from British x* * * r&gt; 1 i . c £&gt;ndn is a rauiu nationalist, and anv action by £ indenendencc r r f an “I *1 f, W '^ ed . into au ins nlt to him or a 'threat to th&lt; independence of any part of his dominions merely makes him more obstinah than ever and more anxious to find means of retaliation. 12 .

There will always be a time-lag between Tehran and the Gulf. The new spirit which may he expected to follow the conclusion of a treaty would arrive late and somewhat diluted in Bushire and Mohammerah, but, with a treaty in operation, I see no reason why many questions which now are referred to Tehran could not be settled locally. 13. r J he mam solution, as I see it, is to pursue as vigorously as possible the negotiations for a general treaty with Persia. Admittedly this is a task of astonishing difficulty, but we ought to attempt it in a most generous spirit. The Shah is used to haggling, and he is quite good at getting a good deal of his way after hard bargaining, as witness the Anglo-Persian Oil Company settlement. Even at the cost of further concessions, we ought, in my opinion, to make a serious effort to rebuild the ruins of our former military prestige on a new foun dation of mutual confidence. Persia as a friend may be worth little to us, but, as anything less, she can be a great nuisance. 16. A treaty such as is contemplated would surely enhance our position in the eyes of the Arabs, whose status Persia would thereby have recognised, and we should have less need in the future of impressing them at the expense of our friendly relations with Persia. 17. An additional way of diminishing friction in the Persian Gulf over the activities of the Shah’s naval vessels would be the conclusion of a bilateral convention with the Persian Government on the subject of the control of the arms traffic in those waters. It might, if you so desire, be possible to stimulate the Persian Government to issue the necessary instructions to their representa tive at Geneva, though I am doubtful whether the instructions would entirely meet our views. Even the signature of such a convention would not, however, solve the problem of smuggling, on which Colonel Dickson’s report, enclosed in India Office letter to the Foreign Office of the 4th July last, throws an interesting light. Sooner or later we shall find it necessary to do something to help the Persians in their attempt to check the contraband trade, which is flourishing in the Arab States, for whose foreign relations we are responsible. ( 2 ) {Received on 31st December 1933, with Political Secretary's letter No. 50, dated 14th December 1933.) Enclosure in Foreign Office letter No. E. 6755]5362134, dated the 6 th November 1933. P.Z. 7934133. Despatch from H. M/s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 486, dated the 20th October 1933. 1 have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, an account by His Majesty’s Consul at Abwaz on a visit paid to the Bakhtiari country in September. 2. Mr. AVatkinson’s experiences throw some interesting light on the affair of Count di Bonzi’s article, with which I dealt in my despatch No. 449 of the 15th September (F. No. 80-N.|33). 3 . I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Consul, Ahwaz (No. 89). Enclosure 1 . Letter from H. M/s Consul at Ahwaz, to H. M/s Minister, Tehran, dated the 11th October 1933. With reference to your letter of the 26th August last, addressed to Mr. Warner, regarding present conditions in the Bakhtiari country, I hav e the honour to submit a report on a short visit which I recently paid to that district. As you are aware, it has been customairy of recent years, when foreign visitors, consular officials or others propose to visit that country, to obtain letteis or introduction to his kinsmen in Bakhtiari from Sardar Assad, the Minister ol War. This has served the twofold purpose of enabling the Bakhtiari Khans to extend hospitality to visitors with less fear of after-consequences and of allow ing it to be arranged to send an Amnieh officer to accompany and watch \isitoi s, ostensibly as a guard. These travelling facilities were recently obtained on behalf of an Italian party which visited the Bakhtiari country in August. n this occasion, when application was made to Sardar Assad for the usual facilities,I was met with a blank 2 ’eftisal and, as you will recollect, it was suggested that an official request should be made through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 2. The Minister for War admitted that his action was partly due to articles which had appeared in the Iran on the 8 th September and on the 11th Septem ber, which purported to be a translation of an account published in the Berner Tageblatt on the 22nd August over the signature of Count di Bonzi, a member of the Italian expedition referred to above, together with the comments of the editor of the Iran. M. Rahnema’s comments were outspoken and possibly partly based on mistranslations, but they had created some stir in official circles, and, 'as 1 was subsequently to find out, the publication of these articles caused considerable surprise and annoyance to the Bakhtiari Khans, whose hospital ity and help the Italians had enjoyed for several weeks. 3. According to the Iraq Times the expedition left Italy by air for Persia at the end of July, arriving in Tehran on the 1st August. It was Jed by Count Leonard di Bonzi and Professor Desio, of Milan University, accompanied by other experienced Alpine climbers. The avowed object of the expedition was chiefly to reach the summit of Zardek Kuh, west of Isfahan, and of Mount Demavend, north of Tehran. The Iraq Times stated that one group climbed Zardek Kuh, and took topographical and altimetric measures for mapping out that region, while a second group ascended Demavend, where they were over taken at night by a violent cyclone and experienced some difficulty. On the 14th September an article appeared in the Messager de Teheran in which the assistance and facilities given by the Persian Government were acknowledged, and it was announced that the scientific programme had been accomplished. It was further stated that mountains had been climbed which had not hitherto been scaled by Europeans. Both the mountains mentioned have of course been climbed on various occasions by Europeans—by my own predecessor amongst others—so this statement was not merely inordinately bombastic, but errone ous. 4. Unfortunately the article in the European press, which aroused the wrath of M. Rahnema, contained other observations of a nature only too liable to cause mischief. It was stated that the expedition hoped to discover a chain of mountains quite unknown till now ; that no more civilised beings were met once the mountains were reached ; that, although assurances had been given in official quarters that the mission need not go in fear of their lives, great numbers of rebel tribesmen were encountered (but fortunately the expedition was well armed !) ; that the Bakhtiari mountains are the highest in Persia and have never been explored by anyone ; and, finally, according to the version in the Messager de Teheran, that the region is “ inculte et inhospitaliere, ’ ’ an arena for bears and wolves, where they were exposed constantly to difficulties and dangers. After conversation with various of the khans who were in con tact with the Italians, it can only be supposed that the writer relied more on the writings of De Gobineau or on his own imagination than on his actual ex periences. 5. Be this as it may, much indig-nation was caused and the editor of the I) an suggested that patriots should not be so enthusiastic or so hospitable in future to foreign missions and travellers, and that the identity of foreign tia'velleis should be moie closely scrutinised, and such as are likelv to publish false infoimation should not be allowed to roam about the country. fi. It was under these circumstances that I found Sardar Assad reluctant to have any connexion with my proposed visit to Bakhtiari. I was later in formed, however, that the Shah earlier in this year told Sardar Assad that he was pleased with the work of Murteza Quli Khan, the present Ilbe°-&lt;n Governor, and appi o\ ed oi him personally, but that he had one bad habit : he was too friendly towards foreigners. The warning was passed on, and Murteza Quli corned with those matters. He further pointed out to His Majestv that if ui ish people oi others came to his house he could not send them to sleep in V C ,5 l( T 7 Gr , Ma 'i est y n °f wish him to entertain visitors steps had better be taken to prevent their coming to Bakhtiari. i. As y«m will recollect, the Cabinet resigned at the time when discussions v ere going on m Tehran about facilities for my visit to Bakhtiari, and no person could be found who was able to take responsibility in so important a matter.I according!} Icit for Isfahan on the 1 /th September, and on the foIlov* r iii , &gt;’ day called on the Governor-General there, to whom I explained that it had %e.en found difficult io obtain the usual introductions from the proper persons in Tehran owing to the fall of the Government. Afshar at once sent a to’e“Tam to the Hbeggi and informed the Amnieh authorities. He mentioned tire Italian party, some of whom he had met, and himself expressed the opinion that the articles in the Iran were all that could be expected of the Tehran press and were clearly based on some misunderstanding. 8 . On arrival at Deli Kurd I was sumptuously entertained by the Governor of Chahar Mahal and by the Rais-i-Amnieh of Chahar Mahal and Bakhtiari, who introduced a stout and jovial lieutenant. This official was attached to my party “ beraye ihliram-i-jenabi-jeneral-consul.” For the next few da vs this indefatigable sleuth saw to it with almost complete success that I had 'riot one minute of private conversation with any of the khans with whom 1 came in contact. 9. Murteza Quli Khan, the Ilheggi, received me with his usual friendliness at Shalemzar, and T stayed in his house for five days along with the Rais-i- Malieh of llakhtiari, who has billeted himself there for an indefinite period, and my stout escort. On the day after my arrival Khan Baba Khan and Maneshir Khan, two half brothers of Sardar Assad, came to visit the Ilbeggi. They were hidden to r emain during the rest of my stay. I spent a day with Khan Baba Khan in his Swiss chalet at Assadieh, returning to Shalemzar at night, and also lunched with Manesh.ir Khan in his own village. I also visited Ohigakhol, the summer camping ground, which is now deserted. The Ilkani had just left there to attend to tribal affairs and to superintend the moving down of tribes from Zardek Kuh to Garmesir ; so I was unable to meet him. 10. The Italian press affair was freely discussed in my presence. A letter on the subject bad been received from Sardar Assad. I endeavoured to calm the resentment by explaining to Murteza Quli Khan and to Khan Baba Khan that as Count di Bonzi was said to be the special correspondent for the Corrirre, the original article may be supposed to have appeared in that journal. Now the word inculto ” may equally be translated in French as “ inculte or “ incultive ” no matter what its German equivalent may have been in the Berne paper. Obviously the latter interpretation was intended, and is it not true of the vast open spaces of Bakhtiari ? Unhappily the Tehran press took it to refer to the inhabitants who were lacking in culture, which was of course absurd. Similarly, I tried to explain to Khan Baba Khan, who speaks French and English well, the European use of the term “ inhospitable ” as applied to grim mountain di si riots. He said that he would pass on my views to Sardar Assad. The legend of bears, wolves and brigands seems to have arisen partly from Khan Baba Khan’s own reminiscences when he entertained Count di Bonzi at Assadieh. 11 . I was unable to obtain any confirmation of the suggestion that this Italian mission was other than purely sporting and scientific. The proposed diversion of the upper waters of the Ab-i-Diz was described to them when they visited the source of the Karun River. Another suggestion made to me in Isfahan was that the party contained an oil expert who was out to obtain .in formation about the area which may he abandoned by the Anglo-Porsmn Oil Company under the new concession. Khan Baba Khan appeared to Ihiuk that all the members of the expedition were university professors. 12. A separate memorandum is being submitted regarding the present condition of the Bakhtiari tribes. Enclosure 2 . Memorandum respecting the Bakhtiari Tribes. General Caudition. —The present condition of the Bakhtiari tribes has remained unchanged during the last two years. They are very poor and in bad circumstances, as their flocks and crops are decreasing owing to lack of money. Neither the Central Government nor the khans give them any financial assist ance. but taxes are extorted steadily. Revenue. —The Rais-i-Malieh for Bakhtiari states that the annual revenue from the tribes is 32,000 tomans. Of this 18,000 tomans is handed over in Qie Ilkani and Hbeggi Governors, who thus each receive remuneration of 7o0 tomans per month. In addition to this, 24,000 tomans is obtained irom the Ls362FD bJanaki and Kkan-i-Mirza tribes. In the days when the khans collected their own taxes from the tribes, the annual revenue was 80,000 tomans, in addition to a further sum collected irom the (Jhahar Lang tiibcs, who aie now dealt with separately. The khans used to pay back, in the form of presents, a certain amount to the various tribal leaders if they were in need. To-day the Central Government gives them no assistance and the khans are not in a position to do so. Migration of Tribes.—The Ilbeggi w^as in Tehran in July, and he w^as received by the Shah, w'ho asked him about present conditions and especially about the movement of tribes from summer to winter quarters. Murteza Quli Khan expressed the opinion, as he has always done before, that the tribes should be allowed to continue their seasonal migrations for the present and not be settled in permanent quarters until proper villages have been prepared for them, say, in ten years’ time. He told His Majesty that the tribes are so poor that they cannot*be expected to build for themselves. On this occasion the Shah said that he agreed and that poor people should not be made to suffer un necessarily, and that orders would be given that movements up and down should not be stopped for the present until further notice. Meanwhile, he said, that he would send experts to examine suitable building sites and to report, after which building could be proceeded with slowly and the tribes gradually per suaded to settle down. If necessary Government financial aid w^ould be forth coming. Murteza Quli Khan thanked His Majesty for making his own imme diate task much easier. Building Commission. — Tw t o engineers, named Gaffari and Ansari, from the Ministry of Communications arrived recently in Bakhtiari and have been living with the Ilkani at Uragan, Chigakhor district. They have visited Kuh Rang, Zardek Kuh. Chehel Cheshmeh, and other summer quarters of the Babadi and Baba Ahmed tribes. On return to Uragan they are said to have reported that it is not possible for the tribes to construct permanent quarters or to build villages in the mountains owing to climatic conditions and to lack of suitable large spaces. But possibly a few permanent buildings could be erected in cer tain places for those who always remain behind when winter migration begins, but not enough to house the whole of each tribe. In any case it is recognised that cattle and Hocks will have to be removed elsew T here in the winter. They are also of the opinion that nothing can be done unless the Government pro vides funds. This report has not yet been sent to Tehran. After examining other mountain districts the commission is going to Malamir, Garmesir and other downi-country areas to report on conditions. (A similar commission is at present ait Khorremabad with representatives of Adlieh, Malieh and local military authorities, with a view to settlement of liUr tribes.) Lynch Road .—The caravan road is guarded by Amnieh. All the forts built by the khans have been rebuilt or repaired. The bridges are in bad con dition. There is some insecurity on the road due to Kuhgilu tribes. During August a band of robbers was causing trouble near to Deh Diz. The officer in command of Amnieh in Chahar Mahal and Bakhtiari went out to Garddneh Chat with a party of Amnieh and two robbers were killed, wdiile two w r ere taken prisoner and sent to Isfahan. This took place during the visit of a party of Italians to Zardek Kuh. A. E. WA^TNSON. October 1933. (3) {Received under endorsement No. 263.) Despatch fuom H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 610, DATED THE 29tH DECEMBER 1933. I have the honour to inform you that the Persian press has paid much a ention to the proposals that have recently been made for an alteration in the statutes of tee League ol Nations. The tone of the articles has been one of un compromising opposition to all change. 2; T [ l 1 e IT^ statements having now^ been followed by an official pronounce ment by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in exactly the same sense I now enclose0 profits on the scale of the An^lo-Persian Oil Company (who have, however, compoiinded their taxation in the new concession) the weight of the tax has much increased. 4. Banks, dealers in exchange, etcetera, no longer appear as a separate category. 1 % organts) have now been divided into six categories instead of tour, and shopkeepers (marchands) are by the present law r treated in the same way as merchants. Previously no tax was payable by merchants whose annual sales were less than fifty thousand (50,000) rials, and in the higher cat ego i les a fixed amount was payable for a licence. By the new law income-tax is levied on net profits so that no exact comparison is possible between tue rates levied on the various categories of merchants this year and by the previous rules m force. G. Brokers and commission agents disappear as a separate category. 7. Doctors and allied professions are divided into six categories instead of three, but these categories are now fixed by their incomes and not bv their general status, and no distinction is made between Tehran and the provinces. It is consequently difficult to make any comparison, but the first class with an income of sixty thousand (60,000) rials, pays the same tax as a doctor of the first class in Tehran did before (which is half what a merchant with the same income pays). The tax of the lowest class is raised from six hundred (600) y 1 / 1 ^ in Tehran and three hundred (300) rials in the provinces to one thousand ( 1 , 000 ) rials. There are also annual registration fees. The doctors are however, taxed more lightly than any other category. 8 . Persons following professions of a commercial or industrial nature form a separate group in which lawyers, previously in the same categorv as doctors, are presumably included. This group is divided into five classes, 'according to* annual incomes, all those having more than thirty-six thousand (36,000) rials a year paying lour per cent., and lower classes pay smaller percentages down to one per cent, on incomes of between five thousand ( 5 , 000 ) and six thousand ( 6 , 000 ) rials. . 9 - The same scale as is applied to professional men is applied to income derived from abroad. 10 . The remaining category is that of the wage earners, whether in govern mental or private employ. The fact that the monthly income is quoted as the basis instead of the annual income as in all other cases, is confusing. There are now five categories instead of four. The full tax of 4 per cent, is paid on all incomes exceeding two thousand ( 2 , 000 ) rials a month [twenty-four thousand (-4,000) rials a year : compare four per cent, on thirty-six thousand rials a vear and over for the professional men] which is the same as before. On the other hand, the exemption limit is raised from three hundred and fifty (350) rials a month to four hundred' and twenty (420) rials a month. . IT Officers of the army, gendarmerie and police do not pay income-tax on their salaries from the State, while income derived from the ownership of pro perty is governed by separate laws. 12. A special chapter deals with stamps on cheques and other negotiable documents. . 13- Exemption is, as before, accorded explicitly to members of diplomatic missions. Moreover, Consular Officers are also explicitly excluded from the operations of the new law, as w T ell as recognised employees of Legations and Consulates being subjects of the country represented, on condition of reciprocity. Ao attempt has, however, been made to impose the tax upon them under the old law. 14. The two principal British concerns in Persia, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Imperial Bank of Persia, are not affected by the new law. the Anglo-Persian Oil Company agreed in their recently revised concession, as I have already mentioned, to pay a fixed amount in lieu of taxes, and the Im perial Bank of Persia are exempt from income-tax. A member of the Bank tells me that so far as the personnel of the Bank are concerned, the tax on salaries w iH be somewhat less onerous than before. 15.

(8) Letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 1988-S. of 1933, DATED THE 30tH DECEMBER 1933. I have the honour to refer to Mr. Mallet’s despatch No. 491, dated the 20th October 1933 [Serial No. (1)], to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, which I have just received in print form, and which I have read with interest. 2. I agree with much that Mr. Mallet has to say on the necessity for facing the fact that Persia to-day is different from Persia yesterday, at all events outwardly, and of shaping our conduct and policy accordingly. I think, how ever, that most intelligent people in this country have learnt long ago that Persia, as well as the rest of the world, is different in 1933 from what it was in 1913, or even in 1923, and realising that “it is better to march with the times than to be dragged along in the procession ’’, have ordered their affairs, official and private, to suit altered conditions. “We have ’’ states Mr. Mallet “ given up the idea that you can bluff and bully the modem Persian ”. I heartily agree, indeed I think I am even more convinced of this than Mr. Mallet. My own sug gestion, for example, in the matter of Basidu was to leave that place while the going was good, wdiile Mr. Mallet was for bluff. To the extent that I am in a position to give an opinion, situated, as I am, “ far from Tehran and its streets and new methods of government ’’ {vide paragraph 4 of Mr. Mallet’s despatch), i C ^ irel &gt;; a f r . ee w **h Mr. Mallet’s estimate of the importance of the role taken 1* /ifi ^ la 1 111 t^ ie ^ &gt;ers ^ an comedy. There is no doubt that in the language ot ihe profession ” he plays his fellow actors off the stage. I quite agfee, too, that it is well worth while to put up with the Shah’s tantrums if this means British X factnrie ^ ^ ^ ^ s P* nn * n £ m ^ s an ^ aeroplanes being placed with 3. I regret, however, that Mr. Mallet gives pride of place in his despatch ^ . lC \ Cma 1 \ la ^ . ^ Gcor d events in the Persian Gulf have unfortunately once iWn ll0 Vxi (le fr dlver £ ence °f view exists almost inevitably between p ‘ f n ,(7 , 0 r 5 ls Majesty’s services wffiose duty it is to w^atch events in * ^ * f [ om t | e . dl ,^ ei * e 1 n . t an S les of Tehran and the Gulf ports ”. Mr. Mallet f on lo e ^P laln that Ins reason for alluding to this divergence is that greater 'enc^dL 36 0bt f ined S the , fllturG - ^wing for the moment th/such a W d 'I 0Uld nGt Mr - Mallet,s purpose have been more suitably full-dress rlesriMf 0 ] 1 f° a ■ 11 i 1 &amp; de . m i' 0 ^cial or private missive, rather than in a given ? ^ C W ^ 1C ^ a fairl y vide official circulation has apparently been personal rebiHnn' ad ’-Jl°^ ve . r ’ that any such divergence exists. - . members of the Fn 1° 1 ^f 1S ^^ a J es ty’ s Legation in Tehran, and with th pleasure of moetimr ^ ri T e P aidriaen t ot the Foreign Office, w r hom I have had th tion I have fmm 1 . j01ldon ’ iav ? ^ een a most friendlv nature. In add in-with 1 hose of fh F Vie ' VS aT L official matters far more often than not coincic b Ul th0Se of the Forei 8' n Office and of the Legation. Similarly, the relation23 between this Residency and the Legation for a considerable number of years have been most amicable. 5. Mr. Mallet refers in paragraph 4 of his despatch to a certain mysterious halo which he affirms adorns the Resident’s head. “ The halo ”, Mr. Mallet goes on to say “ has become less conspicuous of late—like a Titian halo to that of a Fra Angelico—but it is still rather nebulously there ” If it had existed I would have certainly preferred a Fra Angelico halo to a Titian, as I feel that this would have been more becoming to me. I have, however, made diligent search lor the alleged halo, but can find no trace of it in the Residency precincts, nor can any mention of it be discovered after a most assiduous perusal of mv archives. On the other hand, Mr. Mallet states that at Tehran “ we discarded the halos about the time the Persians took to Pahlavi hats ”. I deduce, there fore, that up to some three or four years ago, halos still adorned the heads of the members of the Tehran Legation, though whether these belonged to the Fra Angelico or Titian school, is not known to me. The point is, in any case, of merely academical interest. 6. At the end of the same paragraph Mr. Mallet remarks “ to treat him (the modern Persian) as an Indian is a deadly insult ”. I must confess that I am at a loss to understand this remark. I was not aware that there was one way of ‘ treating ’ an Indian and another way of ‘ treating ’ a Persian, and had always imagined that one naturally gave the same courtesy to one as to the other. 7. “ There will always be a time-lag ” says Mr. Mallet sadly in his para graph 14 “ between Tehran and the Gulf. The new spirit which may be expected to follow the conclusion of a treaty would arrive late and somewhat diluted in Bushire and Mohammerah ”. I do not quite see why the ‘ rare and refreshing fruits ’ which the treaty will doubtless bring forth should not be equally appreciated in the Gulf as in Tehran, and when, for instance, on the occasion of His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief’s visit in January last a successful entente between the British and Persian Navies was initiated by Captain Chauncy at Mohammerah and carried on luTe [vide my despatch No. B.-4 of 19th January 1933, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, copy sent to the Government of India under my Printed Letter No. 52-S. of the same date (File No. 373-N.I33)], personally I did not perceive that the mentality of Bushire and Mohammerah lagged appreciably behind that of Tehran. 8. In conclusion I must apologise if this despatch has been written with a somewhat flippant pen. I am afraid that Mr. Mallet’s flights of fancy may have carried me away. Moreover, while on the one hand I did not see my way to let Mr. Mallet’s despatch pass without some comment, on the other hand, I was particularly anxious to avoid giving the impression that I took his essay on the difference between Diplomats and Political Officers too seriously or too much to heart—which I might have done had I been super-sensitive. Had I taken this view the tone of this letter would of course have been quite different. As it is, however, 1 am indeed only too pleased to be able to conclude the despatch with the hope that Mr. Mallet will be able to pay me a visit in a not too distant future in order to prove to himself by ocular demonstration that the Resident’s halo, if it ever existed, has long since been cast into the limbo of things ‘ lost, stolen or si rayed ’. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India.

I I have the honour to transmit herewith translation of an article from the “ Iran ” commenting on a paragraph from the issue of the “ Near East ” of December 21st which stated that the arrest of Sardar Assad had created a sensation in diplomatic circles. 2. It wall be seen that we have reached the point at which only ill-disposed and unfriendly critics regard the arrest of a Minister of State as anything but a common-place event and that the Persian public is expected to believe that were Lord Nailshan (or the French Minister of War) suddenly arrested and consigned to the Tower nobody in London would be “ thunderstruck ’ . 3. Similar articles have appeared in other papers. 4. We have always believed with good reason that any political article that appeared in the Persian press was inspired, if not actually written, by persons in authority and the present Minister for Foreign Affairs never even suggests that the press is not under absolute control. The inevitable conclu sion is that the Shah believes that this terrible rubbish enhances his prestige amongst his people. He is far more likely to be right than me in a question of this sort, but it is a terribly cruel judgment to pass on an ancient nation. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch, with its enclosure, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 6), and to the Honourable the Folitical Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire (Eo. 5).

Persia—The Arrest of Bakhtiaris. “ The sudden arrest of Sardar Assad, the Minister of War, which took [place one or two days ago, shortly after the arrest of a good number of Bakhtiari notabilities and chiefs, caused great excitement in diplomatic circles of Tehran. As is usual, various rumours and contradictory statements are made as to the reason for this measure which came as a thunderbolt from heaven, but up to the present moment no definite reason has been given for it and some days must elapse before the cricumstances are properly revealed The “ Near East ”, in its issue of December 21st, under the heading “ Persia ”, qu'oting from its correspondent, the news of : (Tehran, 30th November), publishes an account in respect of the industrial developments in Persia, current problems, and the construction of the railway, and therein it commends the attitude of His Imperial Majesty towards industrial expansion, His Royal interest in the creation of factories throughout the country, in the solution of the Basidu case, and in the progress of the construction and opera tion of the railway. Along with these, it inserts the above fines also, under the heading of “ The A,rrest of Bakhtiaris ”. We must either believe that this method of writing things in which in the course of praising, other purposes are served, has grown to be a new style of writing which is being followed exactly by the “Times” also, or we must believe that there is only one and the same correspondent for the “ Times ” the “Near East ”, and perhaps some other papers in England, whose opinions and thoughts are being expressed in various ways in those papers. Not only Persia but even in foreign countries, all know that the arrest of bardar Assad and a number of Bakhtiaris has caused no great excitement either m diplomatic circles or elsewhere, and the event reported at Home or Abroad is not worthy of comparison with a thunderbolt coming from Heaven.

No. (38) in File Na SO-lNjSst'paragraph 1 ’i 0 ) ° f o ar f 23th last I &amp; apn 1, I have the honour to reportat the session of the Majlis of 28th December a Bill was submitted providing for the sale of domainal (Khalisath) lands in the villages and for the exten sion of the duties of the Agricultural Bank. The Bill was adopted unanimously at its second reading on January 7th. 2. In submitting the Bill the Minister of Finance explained that in many villages the State was co-proprietor to the extent of one-sixth to one-third. Experience had shown that this co-proprietorship was as a general rule dis advantageous, the yield from the Government holdings being usually inferior to that from other arable land. The Government did not wish to disclaim their share of the responsibility for this inferior yield, but now proposed to sell a portion of their holdings. The proceeds of this sale together with other credits amounting in all to one hundred and fifty million rials would be placed at the disposal of the Agricultural Bank for the encouragement of a better exploitation of arable lands. The interest on this loan would not exceed six per cent. It had been further decided to advance an annual sum of one hundred thousand pounds (£100,000) to the Bank of Agriculture, to be used for assisting industrial establishments recently created in the country. The presence and functioning of these establishments were of great assistance to agriculture, since they provided a ready market for agricultural products. The Minister probably had in mind the beat sugar, cotton and jute factories recently established, although he did not make any explicit reference to them. 3. In conclusion the Minister said that any financial objections from re trograde spirits to this scheme would be over-ruled by the powers taken to advance funds at a low rate of interest with a view to improving agricultural methods. Proprietars and peasants alike would be required to cultivate their holdings along the lines laid down by the Department of Agri culture, and suitable action would be taken against any person refusing to adopt these methods. The Government did not think that such sanction w T ould in fact be necessary, but w^ere determined, in the interests of the country, to do away with antiquated methods of cultivation. 4. In a later session of the Majlis on December 31st it w T as explained that the Government lands in question would be sold by auction to the highest bidder, but that wdierever possible preference would be given to small landholders. No change would be made in the taxation of the lands thus disposed of, and the Agricultural Bank would charge six per cent, for its advances. 5. It will be remembered that in my despatch No. 130 of the 25th March 1933, I reported that the Shah, at the opening ceremony of the 9th Majlis, an nounced in the course of his speech that measures would be taken to distri bute the crown lands among private proprietors. The present Bill is no doubt the fulfilment of this intention. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade [O.T.(B) 3], the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 7), and His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 5).

Subject to any observations which the Government of India may wish to offer, we quite agree that the sensible course is to let the Persians have their way over this rather absurd business, and to use these titles as often as they like, qualifying the Persian one always with the word “ Iran ”.

I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the (xovernment ot India (No. 14), and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (18) (Received under endorsement No. 20.) Despatch feom H M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, Ao. 48, DATED THE 31 st January 1934. A good deal of mystery surrounds the melodramatic reappearance in Tehran two months after Ins official departure of Mr. C. 0. Hart, the former American M unster here. 2. the present American Charge d’Affaires, who was Mr. Hart’s Secretary professes to be as mystified as anybody by the arrival of his former chief with out evening dress but with a new motor car to lodge with the archivist of the Legation. It seems certain that Mr. Hart is engaged on his former profession of journalism and has in the course of a rapid passage througgh England, (rormany, and the Soviet Union, during which he does not seem to have inter viewed any prominent personalities, written up those countries for a group of newspapers which he is representing. His remarks about Hitler are intended to enlighten the American public as to the Fuhrer’s real origin, a case of mis- gonetion between a rattlesnake and a porcupine. Russia on the other hand is, in Mr. Hart’s opinion a fine country where everybody has enough to eat thou Mi not too much. As for England, I gather that Mr. Hart’s articles are likely 'to consist mainly of sobstuff about Westminster Abbev in the style of the late Horatio Bottomley, while the Irish Free State is dismissed by Mr. Hart in the statement “I’m not a believer in any religion, but My God those fanatical papists just get my goat Mr. Hart denies any inten- tjen to write about Persia in order not to embarrass his successor, but Mr. Wadsworth feels none too sure that this virtuous resolution will be maintained and quite expects that the next Imperial outburst will be directed against the United States of America. 3. Journalism is not, however, according to Mr. Wadsworth, the main object ot Mr. Hart’s return to haunts which he loudly hated. Oil is supposed to be his main interest and the impending arrival of Mr. Clapp, the American oil geolo gist who has frequently been employed by the Persian Government, notably last year at the time of the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company conces sion, is supposed to portend collaboration. Mr. Clapp has apparently fer many years been attracted by a scheme to exploit the small Sonnan oilfield in order to supply Tehran with oil. (See Sir R. Clive’s despatch No. 259 of June 14th 1950) [Serial No. (79) in F. No. 21-N.I30.] Mr. Wadsworth believes that Mr. Hart and Mr. Clapp are backed by a big concern and will attempt to get this concession. They are also said to be interested in the exploitation of oil in Northern Afghanistan. The Afghan Ambassador confirms this, so possibly Mr. Hart’s visit to Herat, reported in Sir R. Clive’s despatch No. 271 of June 17th, 1930 may not have been an entirely innocent as he claimed. 4. The Chief of Police when asked jokingly by a member of my staff what Mr. Hart was doing here poured out a long and most improbable tale about a enrf.et designed by Mr. Hart which a carpet dealer had duplicated and sold to someone else. General Ayrom admitted, however, that Mr. Hart must be engaged in other activities as well. Of course it is possible that among other thi ngs Mr. Hart is doing some business in carpet exportation. He had made a large and expensive collection when Minister here and obviously intended to sell some of it on his return to the United States. 5.

In my despatch No. 31 of January 19th, I forwarded a newspaper article giving some account of a Society for the League of Nations that has been founded here, no doubt under official inspiration. It is presided over by a former Minister for Foreign Affairs and present deputy in the Mejlis, Haji Mohtashem- es-Sultaneh (Mirza Hassan Khan Esfandiary, father of the recent Charge d’Affaires in London) and its governing body includes several present officials in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The governing body lias held several meet ings with a view to drawing up the statutes of the Society. 4. I now enclose a copy of another article regarding the Persian branch of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Later press reports state that the Mejlis met in private session a few days ago in order to consider questions relating to the Union and that the deputies decided unanimously to become members. A counc’l composed of Mirza Hussein Khan Dadgar (Adl-ul-Mulk), the President of the Mejlis, Doctor Amir Alam (the Shah’s doctor) and Mirza Khalil Khan Fahimi (Fahim-ul-Mulk), was elected. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 18). Enclosure to Serial No. (19). Akticle in the Persian newspaper ‘ Ittela’at ’ of January 18th, 1934. Persian Council for the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the Persian Society of Supporters of the League of Nations. These two bodies are considered together because their aims are no very similar. The Inter-Parliamentary Union, which was founded in 1888, has held annual conferences ever since, except for the years 1914—1921. Soon after 1921, Persia joined the Union but unfortunately, although it has subscribed and re ceived the publications of the Secretariat, it has not yet been able to send repre sentatives to the yearly conference. It hopes to do so in the present year. The conference discusses matters of international interest, particularly the reduc tion of armaments, and promotes the settlement of international' disputes by arbitration or legal procedure. The Society of Supporters of the League of Nations pursues similar ends. It is well that Persia should have such Societies. “ It is necessary for a country which has placed its foot upon the road of increasing international relations, and which day by day pays greater attention to foreign affairs, to par ticipate in international questions and keep itself informed of current affairs ”» (20) (Received under endorsement No. 21.) Despatch from H. Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 49, dated the 1st February 1934. + u ^ ^kfd the Minister for Foreign Affairs on January 28th, whether he could ell me what was the meaning ot the virulent press campaign against the Qajar d&gt; nasty on which I have reported in another despatch [Serial No. (21)1 : it had )egun, I ^ said, immediately after the appearance of a report in the “ Daily 1 - 1I0 f r ,, f . P rmc e Hamid. Mirza had played the part of Caliban in some pm ate theatricals. Could this possibly be the reason ? Kazemi replied that it ^ he roaso ^ a } 1 ri g' ht and went on to say entirely spontaneously that the para- . was q mt e innocent and that he understood as little as I did what the press camgaign meant. 1 0 h f&lt; V + e i n0W k° en favoured with a four column article in the “ Shafagh Suikh ’ on “ the errors of British “ Diplomacy ”. 1K ^ tl0ll ^° ) °u with this affusion ; so far as I can understand him an0r ™ S d ? Vut 7 who &gt; P^ably Dashti, believes that His ' 1 • f erameat .iY! 1 ? 1 ^7 the admirable suppleness of their diplomacy, jxtracted all sorts of illicit advantages from Persia during the one hundred pu’v ions to the present regime, are foolish enough to imagine that the sanm ics can x used when lace to lace with the man who has raised Persia from the31 dust and endowned her with a powerful army. In the writer’s opinion it is difficult to find any more adequate explanation of the frequent visits to London of Mohammad Hassan Mirza Qajar and of the comments of the British press cn events in Persia. Or can it be that by these manoeuvres it is hoped to deflect the policy of the Shah which in some respects has of course been injurious to British and other foreign interests : e.g., the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company concessions, “ a fatal blow to British prestige in the Near East ”, the refusal to allow Imperial Airways to use the Persian route, the exclusion of Belgian sugar. But, after all, the only purpose of the Author of the Persian revolution is to liberate the Persian nation from a century and a half of slavery and not to embark on a conflict with Great Britain or any other country. The abolition of the Capitulations, the Trade Monopoly Law and other nationalistic measures have affected all foreign interests, British interests more than others, no doubt, but that is the fault of circumstances and of the fact that British in terests are so extensive ; Great Britain is like a man with a very long nose, who complained to the police that children were always throwing stones at it ; but the children’s reply was that this was not so, the truth being that the nose was so big that it was impossible to throw a stone without hitting it. 4. The long and short of it is that we are solemnly warned, but without offensive intent, that we shall bum our fingers if we flirt with the Qajars. This is quite unimportant, but assuming that people do read their papers can it be a good plan, just before the Shah is going abroad, to put it into their heads that we who are universally believed to have both made and to maintain the Shah, are beginning to have doubts whether our reed has not punctured our hand in one or two sensible places ? 5 I told the Prime Minister this morning what I had said to Kazemi and then spoke in the sense of the preceding paragraph. It was evident that His Highness does not read the newspapers and he admitted that he had not read this latest article, but readily undertook to read the copy I had brought for ms delectation. 6. He was quite amused when I told him that I regarded myself as the modern Sisyphus ; every six months or so I saw the Shah and regularly flattered myself that I had got the stone of his suspicions to the top of the hill, and in variably a fortnight later, I found it speeding down again His Highness was entirely sympathetic, hut was not encouraging, harping on the language difficulty when I said that I supposed it was impossible to see the Shah oftener. He went on to say that it was a great pity that His Majesty could not read foreign papeis for himself ; 1 quite agreed and suggested that au effort should he made to im prove his sense of proportion by translating for him occasionally a really violent article about Herr Hitler or some other notability. 7 As we parted, I told Feroughi that I really did not see how we could hope o conclude our treaty if the Shah went on thinking as the article showed he did, hat we had all sorts of mischievous ideas m our heads. He agreed that such houghts did uot make matters any easier but expressed the connction that ue hould reach the promised land some day. I am quite suie that if ferough! will be delighted. ^ Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Foreign Secretary to tj 1 ® Go ''r ■rnment of India No. 21, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 121 and he Political Resident at Bushire (No. 16). • (2D (Received under endorsement No. ,23.)

With reference to Foreign Office despatch No. 4b3 (K 7208'21134) of the 30th November last, I have the honour to report that the Department of Cum- merce on January 30th published a notice reducing to twenty per cent, the pro portion of dollars which must be purchased at the official rate (Rials -8.-8 to the dollar) in order to obtain permission to import mot « r t Persia.

In my despatch No. 37 of January 25th [Serial No. (17)], I have mentioned a press campaign against the Qajar family as one of the signs and portents which herald the intended departure of the Shah from his realm. 2. As I mentioned in that despatch, the campaign seems to have arisen out of a paragraph in the “ Daily Mirror ” of December 6th, to the effect that Hamid Mirza, the son of the Valiahd, who had taken the part of “ Caliban ” in some amateur theatricals in London, might have played a still more important part if the politics of Persia had been a little different. 3*. The news of the appearance of this paragraph reached Tehran in about the middle of January and was followed bv an outburst in the whole Tehran press against the Qajar dynasty, including the “ cruelty of Agha Mahomed Khan the Eunuch, the “ insouciance ” and voluptuous life of Fath All Shah, the indolence of Mahomed Shah, the love of all sorts of pleasures of Nasr-ed-Din Shah, the apathy and sloth of Muzaffar-ed-Din Shah, the grossness and treachery of Muhammad All Shah and finally the idleness and love of money of Ahmed Shah ”. These sovereigns oppressed their subjects and sold their country to the foreigner : under them Persia sank into an ' unbelievable abvss ot degradation and the Persian character long noted for its hatred of lying and corruption sank to corresponding depths. But all that had been changed l&gt;y the great ruler who had come to the throne eight vears before and had restored ] ersia to the pinnacles of glory and prosperity which were her birth right. One of the articles was entitled ‘ The Tempest of Feelings” and hroughout Them all ran the veiled suggestion that the British were backing me Qajars lor reasons of their own. 4.

His Majesty asked after my health and I replied in Persian using the con ventional phraseology. His Majesty expressed astonishment at my knowing Persian and after being told where I had learned it said that he was grateful that I had taken the trouble to learn the language. I replied that it had been a labour of love. After enquiring how long I had been in the country and what places I had seen, His Imperial Majesty asked if I saw any improvement since my last visit. I replied that I did note a very considerable improvement. His Imperial Majesty then said that he intended to send a Military Attache to London. I replied that he would be assured of a warm welcome but that in my opinion better value would be gained by sending a Military Attache to India for the following reasons :— (i) It was nearer. (ii) The military problem confronting both of us (i.e., the defence of a frontier) v T as the same and our enemies (i.e., the tribesmen) and the terrain w r ere very similar. His Imperial Majesty then turned to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and said that that was a very sound suggestion and that he was to remind His Imperial Majesty about it so that he could issue orders. His Imperial Majesty also said that he would like to send some officers to attend manoeuvres. I said that I remembered a party coming to India in 1924 or thereabouts and went on to say that if I could be of any assistance in arrang ing details I was only too glad to help. His Imperial Majesty expressed his gratitude and hoped that I would enjoy my stay in his country. I thanked His Majesty appropriately and the inter view terminated.

(24) in Pile No. 1-N.|32], and to paragraph 7 of my despatch No. 273 of the 3id June last [Serial No. (8^) in File No. 80-N.]33], regarding the organisa- tion by the International Sleeping Car Company of a through service to Europe via Nisibm and Istanbul, I have the honour to report that Mr. Chaker has re cently paid a th ing visit to Tehran and has given me a little interesting information. 2. His company will shortly put on the Tehran-Khanikin section big six- v ee ei cars, which will be imported free of the obligation (mentioned in the sub-enclosure to your despatch No. 493 of the 30th November) to buv dollar exchange and also from the obligation to purchase an export certificate, thus saving the company some £3,000.I asked Mr. Chaker how he accomplished this miracle, and he told me that it was thanks to Feronghi “ letting the cat oat of the ba£ last year.” The millenary of the birth of the Persian poet Firdausi will be celebrated ceremoniously at Meshed next year and some 200 foreign guests will be invited ; the Shah is determined that they shall be properly accommodated in the towns where they have to spend a night, and realised that foreign help must be invoked. The rest was easy, as Mr. Chnker said that he was prepared to run, but not to own, hotels built to his plans, provided it was made financially possible for him to import his new cars. 4. It is a good example of the universal sweep of the Imperial broom. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 106). (28) {Received under endorsement No. 33.) Despatch fbom H. M.'s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 75, DATED THE IOtH FEBRUARY, 1934. I have the honour to transmit herewith an extract from the “ Setareh ye Djehane ” of January 14th giving details of recent acquisitions of gold and silver bullion by the* Persian Government, and showing the total holdings of gold in the Persian Treasury. 2. The quantities of gold and silver acquired are given in Persian measures of weight, which makes an exact calculation of the value somewhat difficult. It is understood, however, that the amounts acquired in London towards the end of last year were to the value of more than two million pounds £2,000,000, in res pect of gold, and the silver acquired in London as additional backing for note issue appears to correspond to the one hundred and thirty nine thousand pounds, £139,000, shown in the “ Economist ” as having been exported to Persia in the week ended November 30th last. 3. The total holding of gold by the National Bank on Government account, including gold acquired in Persia, is given as 56 kharvars, 51 batmans, 38 siis, 14 mi seals and 725 thousands which, at one hundred and thirty, 130 shillings an ounce, would be rather more than three million, four hundred thousand pounds, £3,400,000. 4. For convenience of reference, the following equivalents of Persian weights used in the enclosed extract are given : One kharvar One Batman One Sir.. One Miscal =654.64 lbs. =6.5464 lbs. =2 oes. 185 grains. =71.6 grains. 5. 1 am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade [No. O. T.

Ls362FD39 The Supervising Body on the note reserves reckoned fonnerlv as in circula tion the amount of notes which they delivered to the National Bank and against which reserves were being demanded. But recently the National Bank observed that inasmuch as a good proportion of the notes delivered are constantly avail- able in the reserves of the Bank, there would be no reason to keep reserves (gold) against them, -therefore, the Supervising Body agreed that in the accounting, the amount of notes kept in the strongroom of the Bank should be subtracted from the total amount of notes delivered to the National Bank • and in order that the note reserves not in circulation could not be decreased or increased without the presence of the representatives of the Supervising Body agreed to have control on them, the National Bank will have to place the notes out of circulation in special boxes provided for them and to hand over the keys to the said representatives. This has been put into effect since the 21st Aban ]312 (12th November 1933). Consequently, the notes delivered to the National Bank for circulation up to 20th Aban 1312 (11th November 1933) reckoned at Kials 21-9,933,450 fell to Bials 21 o,378,450, and the difference, namely, Rials 34,555,000 were locked up under control of the representatives of the Supervising Body. Out of the latter amount, i.e., Rials 34,555,000, a sum of Rials 1,500,000 on the 27th Aban 1312 (18th November) and a further sum of Rials 5,500,000 on the 29th Aban (20th November) w^ere delivered to the National Bank for circula tion, thus increasing the notes being already at the disposal of the National Bank, to Rials 216,878,450 on the 27th Aban 1312 (18th November) and to Rials 222,378,450 on the 29th Aban 1312 (20th November). 2. The stationary notes during the month of Aban 1312 (October- November) amounted to 150 million Rials, including those closed up in the provinces. A brief sketch has been submitted by the National Bank to the Supervising Body, showing the condition of notes on th? 20th Aban 1312 (11th November) as follows :— Notes proposed to be put in circulation Notes put under control of the Supervising Body Rials. 249,933,450 34,555,000 Notes delivered to the National Bank for circulation 215,378,450 Reserves.

The Treasury General has been credited for this amount and the balance, Rials 58,000 has been deposited in the National Bank. In addition, up to end of Aban 1312 (21st November), a sum of Rials 130,450 of old nickel coinage, and further Rials 2,883,693-35 on account of the old nickle coinage which have been put in circula tion are available as deposil at the National Bank.

Mr. Hornikbrook was bom in Iowa in 1884. He owns various local news papers in Oregon, Washington, California, and Utah. He is a -LU.H. of tiie National University Law (School of this city. He was Minister to Siam in 1915-17, and that and his present appointment have no doubt been due to his work on the Democratic National Committee. He is married, and has one son and one daughter. 3. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. (32) (Received under endorsement No. 2(7.} Despatch prom His Majesty’s Mlntsteb, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 62, dated the 7th February 1934. I have the honour to report that before leaving Persia Air. Buckingham, the representative of the De Havilland Company, Avho has recently delivered a number of new aircraft at Ahwaz, gave a member of my staff an interesting account of an interview with the Chief of the General Staff. 2. The Chief of the General Staff and Lieutenant-Colonel Nordquist, who was also present, explained to Air. Buckingham that ten or fourteen more aero planes were likely to be ordered by the Persian Government and that these would probably come from De Havilland. Training aeroplanes were wanted in dis tinction to the new Hawkers. Air. Buckingham expressed his gratification and endeavoured to make the point that in most air forces a proportion of twenty-five per cent, training machines to seventy-five per cent, fighters was kept. The total fighter programme is to be two hundred and forty machines. 3. The Chief of the General Staff expressed his dislike of the American engines fitted to the Hawkers and this gave Air. Buckingham an opportunity to expound the merits of the Bristol engines. He was fairly confident that he had impressed the Chief of the General Staff by his exposition. 4. A few months ago Captain Bartlet, the representative of the Bristol Com pany was in Tehran. He saw the Chief of the General Staff, but gave no account of his interview. The latter has, however, informed the Alilitary Attache to this Legation that he was much looking forward to seeing the new Hawkers. He addod that the “ Hornet ” was a superb engine. Perhaps, however, Air. Bucking ham will have convinced him now that Bristols are preferable. 5. Alajor Pybus adds that he is doubtful whether Air. Buckingham will have made much impression on the Chief of the General Staff bv his remarks about the necessity of a twenty-five per cent, proportion of training aeroplanes. To /he Oriental mind this will appear as a thinly veiled attempt to s n mire further orders. Aloreover, the Persians with the habitual conceit will certainly supporo that they are perfectly capable of handling the Hawkers or indeed a Schneider Cup machine. 6. The Persian authorities seem to have an idea that the aeroplane wh’ch was wrecked on its way from Ahwaz to Tehran was a victim of sabotage bv the Bussian mechanics who overhauled it just before is last flight. Air. Buckingham considers this nonsense, as the subsequent enquiry showed that there was nothing wrong with the engine or the structure and the accident was clearly due to lack of skill in the pilot. Nonetheless, two Russian mechanics have been in prison ever since. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade [No. 0. T. (B.) 14], and to the Foreign Secretarv to the Government of India (No. 26). (33) (Received under endorsement No. 28.) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 67, dated the 8th February 1934. I have the honour to inform you that the Persian Government nropose to celebrate next autumn with all due ceremony the millenary of the birth of the poet Firdausi. 2. There is. I believe, no definite reason for sirnposing that Firdausi was borne in 934-A.D.. but the date is probablv not more than two or throe years out. ‘There is equally little reason for supposing that the spot at Tus, near Af ashedon which a .Mausoleum is now being erected in anticdpation of the celebrations is the spot where he is buried. As the Prime Minister recently 0x1“^ G “ t «&gt;l»onld have f^d o. i lie celebrations will take place about the end of September though exact dates have not yet been fixed. The main feature in the celebrations w?ll 1 do not know, are I understand, at the head of the list of invitations. There will also be such pleasurable entertainments as performances of Persian drama and music, readings from the “ Shah Namek ” (or “ Book of Kings ” the Per sian national epic and the greatest of Firdausi’s works), cinema performances (1 suppose showing the progress of modern Persia), polo (presumably the old I ersian form of the game), wrestling exhibitions and no doubt a great deal of oratory. To these entertainments the foreign visitors and the diplomatic corps are to be invited. In addition, the Shah will proceed to Meshed to open the new Mousoleum and the Orientalists will doubtless be invited to accompany him. 4. The Persian Government are meanwhile endeavouring to secure the best possible version of the “ Shah Nameh ”. There must be thousands of manus cripts of this work m Persia, and possibly some copies of the Bombay lithograph of about 1875. But no manuscript is complete and the Persian Government apparently possess no copy of Turner Macan’s collated, though still defective, edition. They recently borrowed a copy from the Foreign and Political Depart ment in Delhi (File No. 243-N.|33), and this has no doubt been extensively copied, as I am told that a special edition of the “ Shah Nameh ” will be ready for dis tribution at the time of the celebrations. 5. In order to supply this deficiency the Persian Government have not hesi tated to drop hints that a copy of Turner Macan’s work would be a most accept able gift from His Majesty’s Government on the occasion of the millenary. Their intermediary has been Monsieur Hannibal, a Russian refugee who is generally accepted as a lineal descendant of Pushkin. Monsieur Hannibal, who has adopted Persian nationality, is an authority on all matters connected with Persian art and literature and he has presented to the Persian Government a collection of Firdausiana as the basis of a Firdausi Library which is to be established in Tehran. He is now a member of the millenary committee, which also includes the Prime Minister (a genuine scholar and poet), and the Minister of the Interior, Hikmat, and which has already obtained promises of presenta tion copies from some of the smaller Legations. Monsieur Hannibal, who men tioned Browne’s “ Literary History of Persia ” as well as Turner Macan’s work, Avas not given any encouragement by the member of my staff to whom he addressed himself, but urged that the matter should be considered by His Majesty’s Government when they received, as they Avould shortly, a circular communication from the Persian Government notifying them of the celebrations and asking for particulars of the editions of Firdausi’s Avorks available in Great Britain. 6. Although I propose to avoid giving the Persian GoA x ernment any indica tion that His Majesty’s Government propose to make a presentation on the occa sion of the millenary, the possibility that it may politically be A*ery desirable for me to do so, if Anglo-Persian relations are satisfactory and if other Legations are making gifts, should be borne in mind. At the least I should like to be in a position to make the presentation if this appeared to me the correct course A\hen the moment arrived. I therefore suggest that the question of acquiring the copy of Turner Macan’s A\ T ork recently adA T ertised in Heifer’s cMamgue should be carefully considered. I enclose an extract of the notice from the catalogue. I believe that copies rarely come on the market and that it is by no means certain that a copy aa t ou1c 1 be forthcoming in response to an advertisenmnt. If this copy Avere not required for the forthcoming millenary it might pi m e a suitable present on some other occasion, either for the Persian GoAXUiiment oi for the Phah. Another alternative AA T ould be to give it quietly to the Piime Minister if the general Treaty A\ 7 ere successfully concluded. Ai the Avorst, it would form a most useful addition to the Library of His Majesty’s Legation. If it AA'ere presented on the occasion of the millenary it would need to bo p acn&lt; in a suitable case or casket with an appropriate inscription, and pei naps o a rebound. 7. poet’s I mnv add that the Prime Minister recently delivered a hym-e upon work'. His Highness’ remarks were unfortunately inaudiable exceptthose sitting 1 in the front row, but he is understood to have stated that the usually accepted version of the poet’s life was almost certainly a complete fable (an account of this version and of the doubts thrown upon it by Noeideke and other scholars will be found in the eleventh edition of the Encyclodpedia Britannica). Pie also drew attention to the need of a properly edited text and stated that this task would be undertaken during- the year. Pie was followed by Doctor Isa Sadiq, Principal of the Ecole Normale, who gave details of the lottery which has been organised to raise funds for the millenary celebrations. 8.

(34) {Received under endorsement No. 34.) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 77, dated the 10th February 1934. I have the honour to report, in continuation of my despatch No. 581 of of December Pbth last (F. No. 80-N.|33), that Tehran is still completely ignorant on the subject of the Bakhtiari ‘ plot ’ and of the fate of the ‘ plotters \ A few days ago I heard simultaneously that Sardar Assad had been shot and that he was about to be set at liberty. 2. My German colleague tells me that he recently said to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he did not wish to enquire of him the facts regarding the imprisonment of the Bakhtiari Khans but he did wish to know in what light the Persian Government would like the matter to be represented to the German Government. Kazemi, after an embarrassed silence said “it is the removal of the last traces of feudalism ”. 3. From the Chief of Staff the Military Attache has gathered a rather similar impression. Major Pybus asked General Nakhchevan with the naivete which is permissible in dealing with that not highly intelligent man whether other tribes than the Bakhtiaris had officially recognised tribal leaders like the Ilkhani and Ilbegi. The General replied that they had not and that was the im portance of the Bakhtiari position ; he went on to suggest that the imprison ment of the Khans, whom the Shah regarded as opposed to all progress in spite of the tact that they are relatively civilised, was designed to test the strength of tribal feeling and he left it to be inferred that if the reaction were sluggish the next step would probably be the abolition of the posts of Ilkhani and Hbegi fol lowed by conscription and a complete absorption of the tribe in the ordinary administration. 4. Meanwhile the arrests have extended to some of the Bakhtiari Khans resident in Isfahan and in the Bakhtiari country itself. In addition Mr. Watkin- son reported on January 16th, that Hormuz Khan, the bead of the Bakhtiari guard at the oilfields and also the local land-agent of his brother-in-law Sardar Assad, had been arrested and brought .to Ahwaz. His arrest followed a visit by Murteza Quli Khan Samsam, the Ilbegi, who has been able to appoint a nominee of his own. 5. The supposition that the intrigues of Murteza Quli Khan have been responsible for the whole trouble has been strengthened by the dismissal of Amu Mufakham from the post of Ilkhani and by the fact that Murteza Quli Khan is now both Ilkhani and Ilbegi. He is thus able to retain, for the time being at45 s “f; ;s;u' »» 6. Haji Khusrau Khan Ilkhan, K.B.E.

He suggests that the present enquiry will be suitably met if you will be good enough to transmit a brief despatch to this Department, reporting upon the facts and stating what the present position of the case may be. 3. Mr. Shasha has been told that the Department of Overseas Trade have asked you for a report on the facts only and that beyond this they are not pre pared to go.

The articles seized are reported to be eighty bombs, four hundred rifles, and three hundred thousand cartridges, all new stocks and the property of the War Department. 2. This story seemed somewhat improbable to me when I was first told it by one of the most important Persian employees of the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany. It is however confirmed by a merchant who has arrived from Isfahan, who adds that Khan Baba Khan has now been sent to Tehran. Whether the facts of the seizure are correct or not, the arrest of servants of the Khans still continues. Three employees of the late Sardar Zaffar and of Sardar Fateh were recently brought into Ahwaz under escort, one of whom has since been trans ferred to Isfahan. 3. It would of course be an easy matter for the military authorities to “ dis cover ” these articles, which constitute admirable evidence against Sardar As’ad. A further possible explanation is that no discovery was made at all, but that the story is being circulated deliberately on instructions from Tehran or by Murteza Quli Khan, w hose enmity with Sardar As'ad is notorious, though one would think that the present time is hardly one in which family vendettas w r ould be con tinued.

M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, NO. 50, DATED THE 1ST FEBRUARY 1934. With reference to my despatch No. 151 of the 5th April last, relative to the National Bank of Persia, I have the honour to inform you that Herr Walter Horschitz-Rorsl has quite suddenly been dismissed from his post as managing director and is leaving Tehran in a week’s time. The press announces the fact with an intimation that he is leaving without a stain on his character, and almost, one would think, of his own volition. 2. Contrary to what I stated in paragraph 5 of that despatch, it appears that Hussein Quit Khan Nawab, although almost in his dotage, is still the titular president of the bank and exercises a powerful and, according to Herr Horst, malign influence over its deliberations. He has from the first taken up an attitude of criticism against Herr Horst, complaining to Mr. Mallet last summer that he was a Jew, an indifferent banker and a liar, the latter accusation being based apparently upon some photographs which Herr Horst had shown him of equestrian exploits which Nawab insisted must be faked. Herr Horst has, in his turn, never concealed from members of my staff his intense loathing of Nawab, whom he considers thoroughly crooked. 3. Herr Horst was at one time last summer experiencing difficultv over the renewal of his contract, but I had believed that this had been overcome. The excuse now being put about by the Persians for his dismissal is that the Shah considered £5,000 a year and a house to be more than any foreigner was worth, and that the bank’s situation is now so satisfactory that the luxury of employing Herr Horst could be foregone and its a airs entrusted to Mirza Reza Quli, who has for the past year or so been studying banking at Barclay’s Paris branch. T he chief manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, who has a considerable opinion of Herr Horst’s ability and honesty and a great personal regard for him, tells me that he enjoyed telling Nawab exactly what he thought of the case and of its possible evil repercussions on the bank’s credit abroad. Mr. Wilkinson points out that Herr Horst has been responsible for the production of the first honest balance-sheet ever produced by the National Bank (see my despatch No. 555 of the 29th November last (Serial No. 144 in File No. 80-N.[33)]. The bank had been able after its disastrous losses under Dr. Lindenblatt to show a not profit of 2,392,849 rials for the year ending March 1933, and would this year show an even handsome profit, due to the efforts of its German managing director. , ^ Mirza Roza Quli is not a capable financier T find it hard to see where, m the pi esent board, or anywhere else, the local talent can be discovered to compensate the loss of Herr Horst’s services. The principal figures are retired diplomats, a class who are not in other countries very frequentlv found to possess the latent talents of a Morgan or a Rothschild. 7 .A-In order to avoid any misconception, T should explain that though the cn cumslances of Herr Horsclntz-Horst’s departure are tantamount to his being ( ismissed, Ins dismissal has been disguised as the non-renewal of his contract, which expires on the 12th March 1934.55 1^) (47) {'Received on 7th April 1934, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 12, dated 22nd March 1934.)

(52) {Received under endorsement No. 77.) Despatch from H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 175, dated the 7th April 1934. In confirmation of a recent telegram I have the honour to report that the evening newspaper “ Ittila’at ” of the 31st March, published, half-way down the third page and after a number of very unimportant announcements, the following paragraph : Ja’far Quli Khan As’ad Bakhtiari, as the result of an attack of apoplexy in the prison hospital, bade farewell to this world on Thursday even ing (March 29th). 2. 1 understand that the event was announced to the er-Minister of War’s family when it took place. The body was handed over to the relatives, and transported by Amir Mansur Khan, son of Sardar Muhtashim, to Isfahan for burial. 3. As’ad, who according to my records was only about 52 years of age, had nevertheless already had an apoplectic stroke of a mild nature about a year ago, which incapacitated him from work for a few days. It is therefore quite pos sible that he really did have another one, after more than four months in prison. However, lie is the third prominent official to die in prison recently, and the event will no doubt be taken as proof that not only he, but Teymourtache and Ismail Khan Qashqai (Soulat ud Douleh) were made away with by order of the Shall. Rumours are rife that a number of the other Khans have been similarly dealt with, one story saying that Sardar Bahadur, Khan Baba Khan, and three others were asphyxiated in their cell by the fumes of a charcoal brazier intro duced after they had gone to sleep. 4. It is difficult to estimate the effect of this event on either the tribe or Persian public opinion. We are told that the tribe nowadays has turned against its own Khans and takes no interest in their fate. We also hear that the general view is that As’ad, whose past, like that of most other Persians, was not at all blameless, nrobably deserved all he got. But he was the son of the late Sardar As’ad, a very popular figure and one who took a most prominent part in the establishment of the Persian Constitution. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Gov ernment of India (No. 77), the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 74) and to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz (No. 35). {Received under endorsement No. 70.) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 156, dated the 31st March 1934. I have the honour to report upon an entry of Peisian Customs Frontier Guards into the compound of His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate at Zahidan which occurred on August 3rd, 1933. s362 FD58 2 On Hint date four guards searched the rooms of a Persian Ferrash situated in the grounds of the Vice-Consulate, apparently without a warrant, and without informing the Vice-Consul before commencing the search A sack of suear was in fact discovered by the Customs Guards ; this sugar had presum ably been obtained from a smuggler, as the servant could give no plausible explanation of how he bad acquired it. The servant was forthwith dismissed bv His Maiestv’s Vice-Consul, who at the same time protested to the local Governor against the discourtesy of the action of the Customs Guards. 3. Inouiry was then made of His Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorasan whether the servants quarters were unmistakably within the \ ice-Consulate enclosure and an affirmative reply was received. It was decided to protest against the discourtesy of the methods employed by the Customs officials. I informed the Persian Minister of Foreign Afiairs of the tacts in a note, da ed November 25th last, and received on January 15th, a reply which merely stated that the place which was searched was not cpnsidcied as being the building of the British Vice-Consulate 4. 1 did not regard this reply as adequate and in a further note, dated February 5th I expressed myself willing to be convinced that the local officials acted under a misapprehension but could not consider the explanation turmshed as sufficient to close the incident. I then received a note, dated February 11th couched in rather vague and badly expressed Persian which was presumed to mean (a) that the local authorities did not recognize the building as being part of the Vice-Consulate, {b) that, even if they had so considered it, they could still not have asked permission because of the nature of the case. 1 he note added “ Your Excellency will moreover admit that a courtesy is not to be placed on the same level as that of a right and that in accordance with the established international rules it is not possible to object to the inspection which has been made of the place bv necessity ”. To this I replied m a note No. 92 of h ebruary 17th saving first that I found it difficult to believe that tbe Customs officials did not know that the house entered formed part of the Vice-Consulate premises, and secondly that I learned with regret that in the Minister of Foreign Affairs view even had the officials realized this, that they would nevertheless have been justified in carrying out the search without notification to the Vice-Consul and the production of the search warrant which I presumed them to have had. Finally I said I admitted that there is a distinction between the obligations ot courtesy and absolute rights, but I pointed out that T had so far made no men tion of “ rights ” and had no desire to embark upon a controversy regarding the legal aspects ot‘ the case if this could he avoided. I have so far received no reply to this note and there the matter at present rests. 5.

(Repeated India, No. 11.) Persian Charge d’Affaires has protested against article in “ Sunday Express ” of April 15th, alleging impending meeting between Shah and Ghazi at Constantinople on April 18th. After fantastic account of arrangements tor meeting Shah is described as the “ son of a charcoal burner ” and as having “ hacked his way from woodman’s cottage ” and it is implied meeting was engineered by “ Whitehall ” apparently as a demonstration against Sovie^ Russia. Futility of paying attention to gutter press was impressed on Charge d’Aft'aires as also inability of His Majesty’s Government to check such papers. When he protested that Heads of States at least should be exempt from sue i scurrilous comment he was told of scurrilous allusions frequently appearing i United States Press to Crowned Heads of Europe. Such things were benea contempt and Anglo-Persian relations could never be placed on satisfactory basi. so long as contemptible press notices, which would never be stopped, weie treated seriously. Charge d’Affaires fears reaction on Shah of article which he has P^ es ]L m ^^ telegraphed to Tehran.

Note fkom His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, to His Excellency Mirza Seyyid Bagher Khan Kazemi, Minister for Foreign Affairs, No. 203, dated the a} 14 th April 1934. In continuation of my note No. 92 of February 17th (Bahman 28th), respect ing the search by customs officials of a house in the compound of His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate at Zahedan on August 3rd, 1933 (Mordad 12th, 1312), I have the honour to transmit to Your Excellency herewith a plan of the premises showing the position of the house which was searched. 2. As the Vice-Consulate buildings are wholly surrounded by a barbed wire fence and as the house searched was in the close proximity of the Vice-Consulate office, I think Your Excellency will agree with me that it would have been difficult for any official to have entered the house in question without realising that he was in the grounds of the Vice-Consulate. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration. (56) {Received under endorsement No. 86.) Despatch from His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 211, dated the 21st April 1934. With reference to your telegram No. 34 of April 17th [Serial No. (54)], I have the honour to state that I have decided after reflection that it would serve no useful purpose if I were to speak to the Minister for Foreign Affairs spon taneously about the article on the Shah in the “ Sunday Express ” of April 15th. Pie, at least, has no excuse for not understanding either the difficulties in which His Majesty’s Government are placed in dealing with the press, or the degree of importance which any normal person ought to attach to such press utterances. I think I can go further and say that he does understand these things. The Shah’s opinion is the only one that counts, and he is as unlikely to relinquish his belief in the ability of His Majesty’s Government to control the press as he is likely to regard any appearance of anxiety as a direct sign that it pays to indulge in outbursts of temper. 2. I have not yet seen the article in full, but so far as the references to the Shah’s origin are concerned it might fairly be contended that these would be taken as complimentary rather than otherwise by the average reader of the “ Sunday Express 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 86). (57) {Received under endorsement No. 92.) Despatch from His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 208, dated the 21st April 1934. I have the honour to report that on April 5th, the acting head of the V estern European and American section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs called on Mr. Mallet in order to warn him that a note was on its way to His Majesty’s Legation stating that in future no foreign Mission would be allowed to circulate its wireless news outside the Mission itself. Those Missions which possessed their own receiving apparatus might keep them on condition of reciprocity. Private receiving sets (what the Persians call “ Radios-concert ”) would not be affected. Agents of foreign news agencies, such as Reuters, might take out a license to operate a receiving set and sell their news. 2. To-day, a fortnight later, the threatened note has still not reached me and it is possible that the unmeasured terms in which Mr. Mallet expressed his opinion of this latest example of Persian xenophobia may have led the Persian Government to pause and reconsider, if not their decision, at any rate its form. In the meanwhile enquiries in other quarters have led me to think that Mirza Ali Khan Motamedi may not have fully understood his Government’s inten tions.3. The latter have, it appears, been negotiating for some time with various foreign news agencies with a view to the reception of their services by the Pahlevi wireless station and their distribution to the Persian press. The Minister for Foreign Affairs himself has since told me that the Persian Govern ment had bought lie liter’s code and had also come to an agreement with Havas and Nauen : tney had not yet settled anything with Tass. He could not give me any clear explanation of the motives underlying this step. The news about the agreement with Reuters came as a complete surprise to Reuters agent in Tehran, but he has since telegraphed to London and been told that it is correct. The German Minister, on the other hand, is sceptical about any agreement having been come to with Nauen ; he says that some months ago he supplied the Persian Government, at their request, with various details sucli as the wave length on which the Nauen service is broadcast, its cost, etc., but that since then he has heard nothing more. 4. The editors of the Tehran newspapers, including the “ Messager de Teheran ” had heard nothing of the new proposals up to the time of Mirza All Khan Motamedi’s visit to Mr. Mallet. Some days later, however, they were summoned to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and told that as from Sunday, April 15th, Reuters news would be delivered free to the press. This announce ment had been preceded by an experimental period of about a fortnight during which the Reuter service had been taken down at the Pahlevi wireless station and the experiment had proved satisfactory. German and other foreign wire less services would soon be distributed in a similar manner. At the same time the intention of the Government to form a national news agency to be called the “ Pars Agency ” was made public (I understand that Teymourtache investi gated the possibilities of such a scheme some years ago, but that it was shelved for financial reasons). In informing its readers of these new arrangements the “ Ettela’at ” stated that the Reuter news received from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs would be published under the heading “ Reuters Telegraphic News ” and explained that the news items which had hitherto been published under this heading were not really Reuters at all, but “ British News ”. The British official wireless service is in fact commonly called “ Reuters ” in Tehran, being- confused with the real Reuters service which was distributed up to the departure of the Indo-European Telegraph Department in March 1931. 5. The editor of the “ Messager de Teheran ” states that since this interview he has in fact received the Reuter news, but that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, although they are supposed to hold the code, do not decode the news before distributing it. It is in consequence of little use to him and for the pre sent he is continuing to publish “ British News ”. He adds that unlike *• British News ”, the Reuter service is sent to him without any preliminary editing and that its abbreviated telegraphic language renders it singularly difficult to translate or even to publish, few Persian journalists having any ready command of English. 6. The Minister for Foreign Affairs assured me that Reuters and the other foreign wireless services would not be censored, but no one that I have yet met believes this. 7. The existing arrangements for the reception and distribution of the British official wireless service are contained in my despatch No. 215 of May 4th, 1933. The other Missions which make arrangements for the reception of news services from their own countries are the Soviet Embassy and the French and German Legations. The Soviet and French news is published, like the British, in the ” Messager de Teheran ”, the former being translated into French. The German news, owing to the refusal of the editor to publish it in the original German is only distributed to the German colony. Excerpts from the German news are published in French in the “ Sitareh-i-Jehan ” and in Persian in the “ Ettela’at 8. Until further developments occur I propose to continue the existing distribution of “ British News ”. This is also the intention of my German colleague. 9. Personally, I cannot see how the Persian Government can prevent a foreign mission from distributing news received by wireless to any persons they choose, unless they put a stop to the use of private receiving sets altogether. 1 he receiving sets in the Embassies and Legations are no different in essence from the “ Radios-concert ” which the Persian authorities regard as harmless : any owner of a private set can pick up the British official wireless or other foreign services for himself, provided he is a fluent reader of morse and isprepared to sit up to the small hours of the morning. I shall deal with this aspect of Hie qnestion more fully if difficulties occur, hut in the meanwhile l should be gi ateiul for information whether I am correct in supposing that in the i mted Kingdom there is at present no way of preventing anv person, whether a member of a diplomatic mission, a private foreigner or a British sub ject, from ^ taking down any wireless message or news service which his receiving set is powerful enough to hear, and from disposing of copies of any such message or news service to anyone he wishes, either on payment or otherwise. T am ignoring for the moment the question of copyright and also assuming that the messages contain no propaganda directed against the safety of the realm and no matter subversive of public morals. 10. You will recollect that the Persian Charge d’Affaires recently made enquiries of your department which mav have some hearing on the 'present question [see your despatch No. 90 of February 20th (T. 1791|2971373)] It is also of interest to record that Mirza Ali Khan Motamedi, in his conversation with Mr. Mallet, asserted that the Persian Government had reached their deci sion after ascertaining the rule in other countries. According to him thev ** all ” placed restrictions on the issue of news services by foreign missions, hut the only one about vdiich he could speak from personal knowledge %vas Italv where he had just been serving. 11.

T have read through the text and examined the various tables in the volume published by the Municipality about the Census of Tehran in 1933. The major problem is, of course, to estimate the accuracy of ! the figures. The book states that the census vns made by means of two sets of papers—one issued to every individual and one to the heads of families. No one, however, can confirm that individual papers were issued. Fifty secondary school hoys were em- ployecHo distribute, explain, and help fill in the forms.

A brief summary of the main tables follows :— Earlier Censuses : The first census of Tehran Avas made in 1883 (the date 1773 in the index must be a misprint—the actual table refers to 1883) when the population was estimated at 106,482. A second census is mentioned in 1903 when the population was estimated at 160,000 (this increase in twenty years seems improbable ; possibly the first census was very sketchy). In 1923 the Municipality undertook the census on what are described as scientific lines and returned a figure of 196.255. This figure refers to the popu lation within the ramparts : the density of population is said to be 80 persons per hectare.63 families, etcetera, graphs showing the densitv of population in different dis tricts of the city ; the number of employers of labour, etcetera. The following table shows the number of persons possessing more than one wife : 51,443 men possessing 1 wife. 1,031 men possessing 2 wives. 102 men possessing 3 wives. 16 men possessing 4 wives. 6 men possessing 5 wives. 1 men possessing 8 wives. 1 men possessing 18 wives. The Solomons are said to be mostly well-to-do peasants in the immediate vicinity of the city. J In fact the book is most elaborate and treats almost evorv aspect of popula tion, its distribution its occupation and its social divisions. There is no guarantee of accuracy but possibly its “ comparative ” figures are useful in giving a fairly accurate picture of the growth of the population, the occupational distribution, and such averages as the number of families per house and persons per family.

With reference to my note, No. Ill of March 5th (Esfand 14th), I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that owing to an oversight the license No. 166901712 enclosed in Your Excellency’s memorandum No. 22152 1393 of October 10th, 1933 (Mehr 18lh, 1312) did not specify that the consignment of office stationery destined for the Imperial and International Communications Company station at Bushire was to be admitted free of customs duty. In con sequence the customs authorities at Bushire, acting, apparently on instructions from the capital, have stated that they are unable to release this consignment except on payment of duty. 2. I shall be grateful if Your Excellency could explain the position to the competent authorities and arrange for the customs authorities at Bushire to he instructed by telegram to release this consignment, which is for official purposes, free of duty. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assur- ance of my highest consideration. (60) {Received under endorsement No. C.-10.) Despatch from the British Legation.

With reference to my despatch No. Overseas Trade (B) 4 of January 17th last [Serial No. (23)1, reporting a call for tenders for the Ashraf mill, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a statement showing the prices offered by the principal foreign firms competing for this project. These figures were kindly supplied to me by Mr. T. S. W. Jarvis of Messrs. Mather and Platt and are in Swiss francs except where otherwise stated. I am not able to give the price submitted by the Platt-Brothers-Mather and Platt-Metropolitan Vickers group, but Mr. Jarvis informs me that only one complete tender—that of the Berman group Texmaco—was lower (by about 1 per cent.) and that the German group Union Matex was higher by about 12 per cent, and the Societe Alsacienne by about 40 per cent. The tenders are now being examined in detail by a special commission.2 The most serious competitors appeared to^ he the Finon Matex, who represent a German group of good standing. The Texmaco are a German mis cellaneous group of firms apparently not good enough for inclusion in the more representative Union Matex, and, as stated above, their tender was the lowest complete one received. With regard to the Soeiete Alsacienne, I understand that their tender comprised material of much higher quality than that of other competitors, but in view of price considerations it is unlikely that they will re ceive the order. 3. Mr. Jarvis pointed out that Hadji Ali Akbar submitted through M. Agar (of Manchester) and Messrs. Diba and Bayat (of Tehran) offers from no fewer than twenty British firms and two German firms.^ These offers did not represent a complete tender for the mill but were for various sections and in many casts were mutually competitive. The production of such a varied collection of offers elicited much adverse comment as it is obvious that Hadji Ali Akbar and Us local representatives are unable to offer adequate support to any individual firm tendering through them, but presumably will be content to pocket their com mission if any one of the films concerned is awarded an order. Mr. Jarvis considers, and I agree with him, that it is not in the best interests of British firms to be represented in such a manner. 4.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 230, dated the 4th May 1934. 'With reference to my despatch No. 473 of October 7th 1933 [Serial No. (134) in F. No. 80-N.I331, I have the honour to invite your attention to the “ Bulletin de la Banque Nationale de Perse ” (No. 2), a copy of which was fonvarded to you under cover of my despatch No. 202 of April 19th 1934, with special reference to the article on page 9 entitled “ Marche des Changes 2. In this article an account is given of the extent to which the rate of exchange of the rial against sterling varies from the rate which would normally exist in view of the silver content of the rial and the price of silver on the London market. Although there is a lag in the adjustment of the rial rate to the price of silver, the latter does necessarily affect the rate, and any appre ciable rise in the price of silver, such as appears to be favoured in the United States, would inevitably lead to a further appreciation of the rial in terms of sterling. Such an appreciation, whilst facilitating the importation of foreign goods into Persia would, as the article explains, make even more difficult the exportation of Persian produce and would necessitate a considerable measure of deflation. Persia does not desire an increased value for silver, but a stabliza- ition in the price of the metal would be a welcome factor conducive to the stability of prices and exchanges. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade [No. O. 9’. (B) 67], to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 94) and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 33). (63) (Received wider endorsement No. 90.) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 196, dated the 18th April, 1934. 1 have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a translation of the Persian budget for the year 1313, ending 21st March, 1935, published in “ Le Messager de Teheran ” of 8th and 9th April. This budget was passed by the Majlis on 4th March last. 2. Provision is made for a revenue of rials 621,413,417 (six hundred and (twenty-one million, four hundred and thirteen thousand, four hundred and seventeen), say £7,767,668 (seven million, seven hundred and sixty-seven thousand, six hundred and sixty-eight pounds) at eighty rials to the pound and expenditure of rials 621,307,865 (six hundred and twenty-one million, three hundred and seven thousand, eight hundred and sixty-five), say £7,766,348 (seven million, seven hundred and sixty-six thousand, three hundred andfortv-eisrht poumls). This latter figure, however, is slightly different from the fio-ni-es rmhlished in the “ Bulletin de la Banque Naaonale de 1 erse for March Ihieh shows expenditure of rials 621,282 665 (six hundred and twenty- one million, two hundred and eighty-two thousand, six hundred and sixty-iive)- siv £7 766 033 (seven million, seven hundred and sixty-six thousand, and (thirty-three- pounds)—which I am inclined to accept as the more accurate. The discrepancy in any case is insignificant. 3 The totals* show an increase over the last budget of about 115,500,000 (one hundred and fifteen and a half million) rials—£1,443,750 (one million, four hundred and forty-three thousand, seven hundred and fifty pounds). 4. On the Revenue side Direct Taxation is put down at a little over 32 000,000 (thirtv-two million), and Indirect Taxes at nearly 11,000,000 (eleven million), rials more than last year, though it is difficult to see where the money is to come from in the present impoverished state of the population. An increase of 18,000,000 (eighteen million) rials is anticipated from Customs duties, evidently as a result of increased import quotas. Monopoly revenues show an increase of 24,000,000 (twenty-four million) rials, of which 18,000,000 (eighteen millions) from the Opium Monopoly : a similar amount, however, figures on the expenditure side as a credit for the capital of the recently formed Opium Monopoly Company in which the Government has a preponderant interest. Revenue from concessions is increased by 3,500,000 (three and a half million) rials owing to a sum of 6,500,000 (six and a half million) rials due for arrears of fees being included. The figure for Government shares and interest is lower by 2,000,000 (two million) rials, no doubt on account of the failure of the beat crop last year. A large increase is noticeable in the revenue of the Department of Industries in anticipation of a revenue of 9,500,000 (nine and a half million) rials from the new cement factory at Tehran, but against this must be set an item of 8,000,000 (eight million) rials for completion and running expenses of this factor} 7 . 5. On the expenditure side the Ministry of AVar again takes the lion’s share, the estimate, including road guards, showing an increase of 20,0(X),000 (twenty million) rials and represents thirty-seven per cent, of the- whole ex penditure, exclusive of the special credit of £2,000,000 (two million pounds) for military supplies mentioned below. A new item of interest figures in this budget in the form of a credit of 40,000,000 (forty million) rials for public industrial institutions,. 6. A comparative table showing the figures for the last two budgets is attached. 7. As usual, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s royalties, revenue from the Sugar and Tea Monopoly Tax and part of the Road Tax are not included in the budget. 8. Apart from the estimated expenditure, the single article approving the budget states that the Ministry of Finance is authorised to pay from Reserve Funds, for the purchase and improvement of anny requirements, the sum of two million pounds sterling, from which will be deducted payments already effected from Reserve bunds pending* the voting of the supplementarv credit. J. i ress comment regarding the new 7 budget is, naturally enough, somevdiat rest lamed, hut the following two items are of interest in a sense perhaps contrarv to that intended. “ Setareh-ye-Djehane ” of March 6th stated that the rapidity o the iatifiealion of the budget by the Mejlis “ apres une courte discussion” w as^ a record not only for Persia hut for all other countries vffiere Parliamentary regimes existed long before they were introduced here. An article in Shatagh-i-So) kh of March 1st stated that the considerable increase in budget estimates was a real index of economic progress and of the tax-paying capacity of the Persian people, and observed that the more backward and im poverished nations (among whom Persia was to be included in former and less happy times) w'ere those with the smallest budgets 10 I am dealing in a separate despatch with the question of the reliability ot the budget hgures. n.

I would draw particular attention to the sixth and seventh paragraphs of section 2 . 3. I am sending a copv of this letter to His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz (No. 5). Enclosure in Serial No. (69). Summary of Events and Conditions in Fars during the year 1933. The outstanding feature of the year, from the military point of view, was the continuation and ultimate success of the operations directed against AH Khan, Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s step-brother, who in the latter half of 1932 had taken up his position in the hills to the south of Firuzabad. In January and February these operations were of an inconclusive and casual nature, and it was reported that Ali Khan was receiving support from a certain section of the Kashgais and from a few Dashtistanis, and was being supplied with arms and ammunition by Arab rebels along the gulf. There followed a lull in which the Government forces vacated Firuzabad and fell back on Jahrum. In April operations were resumed on a more extensive scale, some 2,500 troops under the command of Sartip Ibrahim Khan Zandieh, Officer Commanding the Fars Brigade, advancing from Jahrum on Firuzabad. Ali Khan countered with his usual guerilla tactics, and although reliable information was difficult to obtain, it was generally believed that unless he surrendered, which he had no intention of doing, there was little hope of the campaign being brought to a definite conclusion. In June, however, it became apparent that the end was in sight. Ali Khan was reported to have suddenly disappeared from the fighting zone with a handful of followers, the remainder having surrendered to the Government troops. Early in the following month, suffering no doubt from lack of supporters and shortage of supplies, he accepted an offer of pardon extended to him by the military commander, and was brought to Shiraz on the 18th July and immediately conveyed to Tehran. A report that he had been pardone’d and granted a pension has not since been substantiated, and his ultimate fate must remain a matter for speculation. His submission has deprived the tribes-people of a leader who was evidently a first-class fighting man and a clever strategist, and has no doubt been a useful contribution to the Government policy of breaking up the tribes into small and well-behaved sections, lacking in leadership and, in consequence, incapable of concerted action. The triumphal procession of the returning army to Shiraz with an elaborate display of prisoners and captured ammunition was evidently calculated to act as a salutary warning to any others who might be foolish enough to contemplate defying the forces of law and order. The news of Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s death in Tehran in August was, according to all reports, received with indifference by the Kashgai tribesmen, and it seems probable that since his recall to the capital in April 1931 they had ceased to regard him as their leader, and were in any case not sorry to be freed from a suzerainty which must at times have proved irksome and even oppressive. \\ hot her (heir lot has improved under the rule of a Military Governor is a ques tion which is not easily answered. Of the other tribes—the Khamseh, the Boir Ahmadi and Mamassani—little was heard though progress was reported with the Government’s efforts to settle them in the new town of Tul-i-Khosro. The imprisonment of the Kawam-ul-Molk in December, beyond giving rise to one or two bazaar rumours, provoked littlecomment The confiscation of his lands in June 1932, undoubtedly threw many threw mUefr °vm f k'^k 1 is , pre f ty certain that so “ e 'f these inicw in men lot with the vanous robber bands which were in evidence durintr the year.

'i’ h ^a' U&lt;bb)ln f?' 3 } 1 - w ho had been appointed Governor-General in I ars in July 1J32, was suddenly recalled to Tehran on the 19th August. After a short interval, during which Mirza Mohd. Ali Khan Shaibani, director of the bmance Department of Fars, assumed the duties of Acting Governor-General, -Inza Majid Khan Ain, formerly of the Judicial Department in Tehran was appointed to the vacant post and arrived in Shiraz on the 29th September. The new Governor-General, whose pet schemes are to provide Shiraz with an adequate water supply and to construct additional “ khiabans,” has proved himself a capable and energetic official, and has adopted a helpful and friendly attitude towards His Majesty’s consulate. . Wher local officials also appeared to be well disposed but, acting evidentlv on instructions not to enter into intimate relations with foreigners of anv description were careful to keep themselves at a discreet distance. The ban also tell, though perhaps less rigidly, on non-officials, and there was more than one instance of Persian visitors to the consulate being questioned by the police as to the reason of their visit. As a result, many of those who used to be frequent visitors lalterly never put in an appearance. In some cases they expressed iegret and hinted darkly that they would like to, but feared the consequences. A notable and pleasant exception was provided by one old Persian merchant of some 70 or 80 years of age, formerly a power in Shiraz, now something of a spent force but still a greatly respected figure, who arrived quite cheerfully as! ride his donkey, whenever an occasion for calling presented itself. Economic hardships probably prevented the people from bothering their heads overmuch with political questions, and the Basidu incident, though reported briefly in the local press, failed to arouse any real interest, much less ill-feeling. Similarly, the press article dispute in the latter part of the year produced no visible repercussions, and probably passed unnoticed by all save habitual readers of the Tehran newspapers. What is more certain, however, is that there were genuine and widespread complaints against the present Government and a belief, freely expressed, that its economic policy was ruining the country. Landowners and cultivators found it impossible to pay the revenue charges of two or three years ago. The Gov ernment Departments would agree to no diminution, and failure to pay meant fines and confiscation of crops. The merchants also, fettered by regulations and handicapped by the almost complete cessation of the opium trade and the poverty of the peasants which its non-cultivation entailed, and by the fact that the present import quotas tended to divert traffic from the Bushire-Shiraz route to the Bandar Shahpur-Ahwaz route, complained bitterly that the volume of trade had shrunk to one-third of what it had been in former years. While such comnlaints were not aim n d directly against His Imperial Majesty, there can be little doubt that part of the blame for the present state of affairs was attached to him and, though he was still admired for his courage and energy, certain veiled criticisms of his action in acquiring pronerty for himself at the expense of his people were heard from widely separated quarters. The condition of roads and communications in the province showed no appreciable change from the previous year. Minor improvements were effected on the roads from Shiraz to Bushire and Isfahan, and repair gangs were inevidence at various points. Shiraz was linked by telegraph to Ardakan to the north west and to Firuzabad to the south. Work on the new motor road to the latter town was commenced, and a strip extending some 5 or 6 miles out of Shiraz was completed by the end of the year. The intention is that traffic between Bushire and Shiraz should eventually travel via this route instead of as at pre sent via Kazerun. The upkeep of the streets of Shiraz was on the whole satis- ^ factory though several gaping holes at various points threatend disaster to the unwary motorist. A newly acquired motor fire-engine contributed to the water ing of the main thoroughfares and also to the entertainment of the populace, since it never failed to attract an admiring crowd whenever it stopped to refill. Remarkable progress was made during the year with the project for erect- in ? a spinning mill in the town. After some initial difficulties a company was quickly formed and in March an order was placed with Messrs. Platt Brothers and Co (Ltd.) of Oldham for 5,000 spindles. During the summer work pro ceeded steadilv with the construction of the mill building ; m the autumn the machinery duly arrived at Bushire, was transported to Shiraz and the work of fittino' and installing under the supervision of an English mill manager, an Eng lish mechanic and two English fitters was well advanced at the close of the year. Sir Aurel Stein, K.C.T.E., having paid a brief visit to Shiraz in March, returned in November with the intention of making an extended archaeological tour in the eastern and south-eastern portions of the province. After a short delay due to difficulties over escort arrangements, Sir Aurel left Shiraz on the 21 st November for Firuzabad. The following day news was received from His Majesty’s Legation in Tehran that the local authorities considered visits to certain places, including Lar and Darab, for the pi esent inad\ isable. Tn spite of various representations, this decision was maintained until the end of the year. In November a party of Anglo-Persian Oil Company geologists under Mr. Washington Gray, using Shiraz as their base,, commenced a survey of the region included in the quadrilateral formed by Shiraz. Tvazerun, Jahrum and Niriz. A second party under Dr. Harrison starting from Isfahan were carrying out simultaneously a 'survey of the area to the north-west of Shiraz and to the south-east of Urdjan. Two Dominican priests, the Very Rev. Father Dominic Blencowe, O.P., and Father Cyprian Rice (formerly of the Levant consular service) arrived in Shiraz in November and rented two bungalows in what v T as formerly' the Indo-European Telegraph Department compound, for the purpose of founding a monastery. Their flowing white robes made them conspicuous figures when they appeared in the “ khiabans ” and at first aroused some curiosity amongst inhabitants. Father Blencowe himself tells the story of the small boy 7- who one night mistook him for a ghost and proceeded to throw stones at him. Their failure to produce a permit (which has since been granted) brought them into temporary connicl; with the police authorities, who refused to allow them to receive persons into their chapel pending its production. There was reasonable evidence to suppose that a certain clique, of which M. Cassin, the French Consul in Bushire, who spen a greater portion of the summer and autumn in Shiraz, appeared to be the leader, resented the apnointment of British nriests to a district which had hitherto been attended to by French priests from Isfahan.

Despatch from the British Consul at Ahwaz, to H. M.’s AIinister, Tehran, No. 37, DATED THE 21 ST Al&gt;RIL 1934. 1 have the honour to report that on Saturday the 14th instant I was advised by telephone from Masjid-i-Suleiman that Murtesa Quli Khan the Bakhtiari Chief had arrived at “ Fields ’’ on his annual visit and that it was usual for H. M. Consul to call on him during his stay. After due consideration of the politcial position as outlined in recent report* 3 , I formed the opinion that it would be advisable to continue the courtesy and 1 therefore left Ahwaz for Masjid-i-Suleiman on Tuesday, the 17th instant. Just before my departure, I was informed that an Intelligence Officer had already been sent to Masjid-i-Suleiman to purchase horses and mules so, in order to give my visit the appearance of an un-official excursion, I was accom panied by my wife. The presence of mv clerk could, if necessary, be attributed to my ignorance of the road and the object of my visit to my desire to make myself acquainted with my district as soon after my arrival as possible and before the advent of the hot weather. In spite of the apparent enthusiasm with which my proposed visit had been received by the Anglo-Persinu Oil Company’s Officials in “ Fields ” I was advised on arrival at Dar-i-Khasineh that the Chief was greatly perturbed at the news of my impending arrival and it was suggested that 1 should even then postpone my visit until after his departure. In view of the fact that my domestic staff as well as the Persian clerks in the office and doubtless, the aufliorilies in Ahwaz all knew of my intention to visit Masjid-i-Suleiman, it appeared to me particularly indiscreet to turn back at that stage so it was decided to regard my visit as purely private and to forego all contact with Persian Officials. Mr. Blackford, the Commercial Superintendent of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in “ Fields ”, whose guests we were, explained that Murtesa Quli Khan was greatly upset at his inability to receive me but he frankly admitted that he was scared to do anything which might hasten a family reunion in “ The Better Land ”, particularly as everyone knew the breed of mules which had attracted the military officer to Masjid-i-Suleiman. He referred to the recent misfortunes which had overtaken his family and to his fear of displaying any signs of mourning which might be interpreted as an expression of sympathy and would inevitablv lead to his own immediate arrest. He welcomed the opportunity which Moharrem afforded for even the slightest expression of grief. I sent a message in reply that I quite understood his present difficulties and I was sorry if the coincidence of mv visit with his had caused him anv incon venience but. in view of the private nature of mv excursion, I hoped that he would excuse me if I delayed the honour of making his acquaintance to a later date. He informed Mr. Blackford that in spite of the attentive escort who had accompanied Mr. Watkinson on his tour of the Bakhtiari country last year His Imperial Majesty had called for an explanation of the obiect of Mr. A\ atkinson’s visit and for a detailed report of their conversations. The Khan explained that the Consul’s arrival had been a complete surprise to him but that as a repre sentative of His Majestv he could not do other than extend his hospitality. For details of the conversation he ventured to suggest that the escort would be able to supply the fullest details. 1 arrived at Masjid-i-Suleiman on the Tuesday evening, was conducted over the installation on the Wednesday and returned to Ahwaz on Thursday via Kaft Kel.

With reference to my despatch No. 263 of the 30th May, 1931, I have the honour to report that the Persian Government have decided not to renew the contract of M. Leon Smets, the Belgian Treasurer-General, which expires on the 10th April. 2 . I am not aware of the reasons for this decision, but understand that it 18 proposed to appoint a Persian to the post of Treasurer-General. The noti fication of the termination of his contract, which was only conveyed to him very recently, came as a complete surprise to M. Smets, who seems to have carried out his duties ably and conscientiously. It appears to the layman a casual and hazardous proceeding to replace practically simultaneously the German manager of the National Bank and the Belgian Treasurer-General with Persian nominees of much less experience and unproven capacity. 3. 1 am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade [No. 0. T. (B.)-51j. (75) (Received on 30th June 1934, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 24, dated 14th June 1934.) (Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. E. 29581352134, dated 7 th June 1934.) P. Z. 3828; 34. Despatch from H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 195, dated the 18th April 1934. With reference to my despatch No. 166 of the 6 th April [Serial No. ( 74 )], I have the honour to report that M. Smets left Tehran on the 17th April, having arranged with the Persian Government for the receipt of full pay during the period of leave due to him,'which expires with his contract on the 10th July next (not the 10th April as stated in my earlier despatch). He will then resume employment in the Belgian Treasury. 2. In the course of a conversation with a member of my staff, M. Smets expressed himself as pessimistic on the subject of the financial future of Persia. To begin with, he finds it hard to believe that the National Bank will be as adequately managed by a Persian colonel with “ a good apprentice’s grounding in the principles of banking ” as it has been for the past year under Herr Horst,96 More serious still is the habit of wildly extravagant spending which seems to be deveolping into a rake’s progress. According to M. Smets, the whole £4 million received from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company will soon have been spent. Half of it is earmarked in the single article approving the recent budget as expendi ture from “ reserve funds ” to be devoted to the purchase of war material in Europe, and of this sum a great part has in fact already been spent. The pur chase of gold last year accounts for the remainder, but this gold will, M. Smets thinks, have to be used sooner or later to pay for imports. In fact, to all intents and purposes, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s money, which wisely used might have strengthened the country’s position, has been squandered. The guns, motors, aeroplanes, &amp;C., will all require upkeep, and where will the money be found for it ? In his view, Persia will be driven to borrow money within eighteen months from now. The limit of taxability has already been reached, if not exceeded, and no new windfall can be foreseen. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s royalties will of course provide a first-class security for a loan, but the spendthrift nature of the Persian Government will not encourage foreign countries to lend money at a low rate of interest. 3 The budget figures, which are given in my despatch No. 196 of to-day, are, according to M. Smets, quite unreliable. The Persian press has recently taken the line that a nation’s greatness can be judged by the size of its budget, and the progress of Persia under the Pahlavi regime can be measured by the great increase in her revenue and expenditure. Therefore the present estimates are framed on a more grandiose scale than is actually contemplated ; most of the Government Departments will actually spend less than is budgeted for them, the exception being the Ministry of War, whose proportion of the whole expendi ture will thus in reality be over 50 per cent, instead of about 40 per cent, as budgeted (this does not include the expenditure from the “ reserve funds,” £2 million for this year). Equally, the actual revenue will fall considerably short ol what is estimated. Taxation on land has reached saturation point. Landowners tell us that they now make less than 3 per cent, out of their properties, which, for a Persian, is a ludicrously small profit. As for the mono polies, the sugar tax is now so excessive that the peasants have taken to eating raisins with their tea instead of sugar. 4. Not all qr the expenditure is unproductive. The luxury taxes which build the roads are obviously put to useful purpose. A great deal of the military expenditure is justified by the fact that unless the troops control the country districts no revenue comes in. But on the subject of the railway, M. Smets confirms my view that it is a ghastly waste of money, and that the frequent cnanges of alignment which are necessitated by the Shah’s determination that the line shall pass through numerous properties of his own are costing the couniiy a fantastic sum. A recent instance of this was when a new alignment vas decided upon which required that a tunnel should be bored through a gravel u , instead ot solid rock as originally planned ; the result was that the tunnel tell m and killed several workmen. o. To sum up, M. Smets foresees that, at a moment when it is hoped that o ier countries will be emerging from the world economic crisis, Persia will be &lt;n ci mg upon a period of financial difficulties which may easilv lead to bankruptcy. m ?\T aill r 80 m^! 1 T? ^ 00 I ) y this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade [No. 0.

It was announced a few days ago that none of the contracts of the eight Belgian customs officials would be renewed and that they were leaving the country in about three weeks’ time. I gather that the Director General, M. Dekercheer, whose contract would normally have expired at the end of September, recently expressed a wish to be released sooner. His request was granted, and apparently the Persian Government managed in some way to make his request an excuse for ridding themselves of the others, on whoso behalf my Belgian colleague has made entirely unsuccessful representations. He informs me that the Persian Government are endeavouring to obtain the services of four Belgian “ inspectors ” who will not administer the customs as in the past. 2. As you are aware, there is a belief that there is more corruption at present than for many years past, and M. Dekercheer anticipates that the removal of the Belgian officials will result in a loss of some £300,000 a year in customs revenue.Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 332, dated the 10th July 1934. (Received under endorse ment No. 147.) My attention has recently been called to certain articles in the Persian Law concerning- Military Tribunals, which in some cases render civilians liable to be tried before military tribunals. 1 have the honour to enclose a transla tion of the relevant articles of the law. 2. These extracts do not make it clear whether a proclamation of martial law (etat de siege) is necessary before civilians can be tried by the militarv authorities, though the references in articles 200 and 201 to- “ the enemy ,r would seem to presuppose war, either external or civil. On the whotfe I think it probable that the Persian Government would have little hesitation in invoking these articles in peace or wartime, tt therefore becomes necessary to decide what attitude this Legation should adopt in the event of a British Subject being (brought to trial before a military tribunal 3. Article 3 of the judicial safeguards enumerated in the exchange of notes of May 10th^ 1928 (F. No. 764-NJ27), provides that only courts sub ordinate to the Ministry of Justice shall be competent to try British Subjects, except in the event of the proclamation of a state of siege. This article would therefore seem to preclude the application in peace time of the Persian Mili tary Law as far as British Subjects are concerned. I should, however, be grateful if my interpretation could be confirmed. 4. I do not propose to raise this issue with the Persian Government at the present moment unless specially instructed to do so. It is, however, desirable that the Legation and His Majesty’s Consular Officers in Persia should be forewarned regarding the attitude to adopt in the event of an attempt being made to try a British Subject before a military court. 5.

Ls362FD(85) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 335, dated the 12th July 1934. (Received under endorse ment No. 148.) I have the honour to refer to your despatch No. 188 of April 19th last, and to report that as a result of a series ol unpleasant incidents the Swedish Officers attached to the Persian Air Force have given notice that they intend to break their contracts with the Persian Government and are le'aving for home in a few days’ time. 2. The Swedish Officers are extremely indignant at their treatment and say that, although the Persians are now begging them to stay, nothing will induce them to do so, as they think that to do so would end by damaging the reputation of the Swedish Air Force. If they were to succeed the Persians would take all the credit, and if the Persian Air Force were to come to grief the blame would be put on the Swedish Mission. 3. The incidents included an apparently deliberate attempt to murder one of the Swedish pilots by emptying his petrol tank until only enough petrol remained for a quarter of an hours’ flight and a childish attempt to persuade the Swedish Commandant to accept responsibility for an accident in which a Persian pupil and mechanic, who were flying without the permission of the Swedish Mission, were killed. The final straw was that one of the Swedish pilots was dismissed without notice because an aeroplane in which he was flying had crashed. 4 . I learn that the Persian Air Force officers have never ventured to fly the Hawker Hart machines since they reached here last spring : they are afraid of crashing them, which would lead to the imprisonment of the pilot if he survived the crash ! 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 148) and to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Baghdad (No. 46). ( 86 ) {Received under endorsement No. 151.) Despatch from H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 335, dated the 14th July 1934. In my despatch No. 195 of April 18th last [Serial No. (75)], I had the honour to report the somewhat alarming remarks of the retiring Belgian Treasurer General on the subject of the financial extravagance of the Persian Government. 2. Further information which reaches me from various sources tends to confirm the view that the Ministry of Finance is beginning to feel the pinch already. There has been a quite unreasonable delay in connection with award ing the order for the cotton mill at Ashraf and I now hear that the main reason is lack of funds, in spite of the fact that the Mejlis recently agreed to a vote placing (£250,000) (two hundred and fifty thousand pounds) at the disposal of the Department of Industry for this and other projects. Mirza Ali Akbar Khan Davar is apparently trying to work out a scheme for obtaining foreign financial support for the Persian textile industry, but having turned down Monsieur Miret de Maymir’s project, it is not clear what is to be his next move. Davar is, according to common gossip, likely to be the next Minister to incur the Imperial dislavour, not I imagine because of any particular incapacity for his work, but rather on account of his inability to make bricks without straw. 3o 1 hear that the whole of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s royalties i n future are to be devoted exclusively to the needs of the Army and to railway construction, though this does not mean that much will be left over for the rail way if the experience ol past years is to be believed. Already the work on the southern section is held up owing to lack of funds. 4. Although during the last few months the National Bank has ceased to publislpits regular returns showing the amount of the note issue, it is believec that existing notes are covered by gold up to 100 per cent, (one hundred po^ centum). Obviously, therefore, the Persian Government can afford to part with at least 40 per cent, (forty per centum) of such gold cover without undue ns and such a step would probably make available a sum of about £1,250,000 (e 116103 million, two hundred and fifty thousand pounds) which could, for the time being, fill the gap caused by the many extravagant schemes now afoot. It is difficulty however, to see how Persia can long avoid a very serious financial crisis. The evidence of reckless public expenditure in all directions is astound ing. As a smad incident, it is worth quoting the apparent readiness of the Tehran Municipality to part with about £12,000 (twelve thousand pounds) for the pleasure of pulling down the east wall of His Majesty’s Legation and there- by widening a street which is already amply wide enough. The Shah’s appe tite for industrialisation seems to grow apace and will probably have been stimulated by his journey to Turkey. It seems highly speculative whether the new industries can, after the first flush of enthusiasm, be made to pay their way. 5.

No. 273, dated the 29th May 1934. I have the honour to report that a notification appeared in the local press on the 10 ih October last to the effect that the Ministry of Finance had decided to exercise a rigorous control over all provincial administrations. For this pur pose provincial administrations were divided into fifteen areas, and two con trollers, one for finance and the other for justice, were appointed for each' of these areas. 2. No further communication was published in the press hut according to information obtained casually and privately at the Ministry of Finance, the position is as follows :— The matter was first under consideration when Taghizadeh was Minister of Finance, but it was not actually put into effect. One general inspection was carried out with apparently gratifying results as no sensational irregularities were brought to light. The system has now been modified and the country has been divided into five sections :— (1) Central—namely, Tehran, Sultanabad, Qum and the ’Edareh-i- Salas. (2) Northern—covering Gilan and Mazendran. (3) Eastern—covering two sub-sections : one up to Neishapur and the other from Neishapur upward. (4) Western- -covering Kermanshah, Hamadan and Azerbaijan. (5) Southern—covering Fars, Khuzistan and Kerman. Each section is headed by a Director and they are all under the supervi sion of Monsieur Delcorde, Director of the Inspection Department of the Ministry of Finance. The object of this reorganisation is not evident if it is true that inspectors have been instructed not to institute too rigorous a control over the local financial agencies, but to content themselves with investigating and reporting on grave irregularities, if any. It is said to be feared that strict inspections would lead to the dismissal of employees of the Ministry of Finance, a development which would be inconvenient as there are no suitable officials to replace them. 3.

I have the honour, with reference to my despatch No. 338 of July 14th, to transmit a copy of an interesting minute by the Commercial Secretary to this Legation on the subject of the expenditure on the Persian railway. 2. It will be icmombcred that Mr. Smets, whose remarks I reported in my despatch No. 195 of April 18th [Serial No. (75)], took an equally gloomy view of the future and there appears to be little doubt that unless expenditure on the railway is greatly reduced the Persian Government will very shortly find itself in a most unhappy financial position. 3. A story is in circulation to the effect that since his return from Turkey the Shah has decreed that the railway shall be completed in the shortest time possible. The Council of Ministers is alleged to have represented that a foreign loan or some form of foreign financial assistance would in that case be neces sary. But His Majesty would not listen to anything of the sort, insisting none the less that there be no delay in the work. The Council of Ministers are now reported to lie engaged, with the assistance of Kampsax, in elaborating a scheme under which a foreign credit will be disguised as “ delayed payment 4. I told the Minister for Foreign Affairs a day or two ago that there were rumouis m ioreign circles that the financial position was becoming a little diffi cult and that the result might be some delay in completing the railway : IJis Excellency replied that the finances of the countrv were flourishing, that all the money required for the railway was in sight, that is, that it would be available as and when requiled, though it was true that the Southern section would not &gt;e finished till a few months later than had been contemplated. rr P* I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas India (No IGl) 1 ‘ ^ ^ t0 thG Forei ^ Secretary t Q the Government of * * ^ mce writing the above the Commercial Secretary has heard fror ' r * y*norgopoulos that the scheme for “ delayed payment ” mentioned in pan l .f° a ! &lt;n P’/ ! s taking shape.

Enclosure in Serial No. (91). Report on the Muharram ceremonies of the current year. Historical retrospect. In order fully to understand the significance of the Muharram ceremonies and to estimate the reasons for the present attitude of the Persian Government towards them, it will be necessary to examine briefly the history of the ceremonies particularly in regard to the political significance which various Persian Govern-* ments have given to them. 2 . The battle of Kerbela, in which the son of Ali, Hussein, was killed, took place in A. D. 680. The event marked the suppression of legitimist faction the members of which held that the supreme spiritual authority must for ever rest with the descendants of Ali, by the rival Omeyyad faction, which together with the Abbasids provided the orthodox caliphs for several centuries there after. The sect of Ali’s supporters, however, did not disappear, in spite of continual and severe persecution. The site of the battle of Kerbela, and the grave of Hussein, which were at first visited by the members of the'defeated faction as a place of pilgrimage, were razed to' the ground and ploughed up : but the party of Ali thrived under repression and became knowm as the Shi’ah (schism). The details of the tragedy were handed down by word of mouth and certain descendants of Ali became the “ Imams ” which the Shi’ah sect regarded as the rightful successors of the saintly Ali and his martyred sons The movement gained importance and received governmental tolerance and support m the first half of the third century of the Hijrah, under the Bu way hid d} nast) who gained possession of Baglidad in the year 945 A.

The uwayhids were of Persian origin, and their support of the Shi’all was doubt- ess prompted by the idea that dissension within Islam would undermine the (bTTrf P °' er •' Ueh the A1 ? baside Caliphs had long exercised It appears that hr first mourning ceremonies m Baghdad took place in the year 903 A D being ordered by the Buwayhid prince Muizz-ud-Douleh Ahmad &gt; The orthodox or Sunni doctors were surprised at the order but were unable to resist it The were r to S b 7 celeb e ra?Th d tn^t da &gt;’ s «ie month of MuhaJam the ueotile who had tn ' e closure of all the bazaars and by mourning by all instituted the feat? f ^ b ack „ clothe «- A few years later the same dynasty describing the ^cveiP U !

The fall of Isfahan in 1722 marked the collapse of the Safavi dynasty Its successors, the Afghans, the Afshars, and the Zands, did nothing remarkable as far as religious propaganda was concerned. The Qaiars however who firmk established themselves at Tehran at the end of the 18th centa^ werfi^t ™ow to continue official support to the Shi’ah sect, and in particular to the Marram ceremonies. In he works of Morier will be found detailed and remarkaWe descriptions of die mourning celebrations in the early part of the nmeteenth century A whole series of poems concerning the death of the martyrs had been published trom Safavi times onwards, and the “ Passion-plav ” or ta’ziueh performed by paid actors and depicting, with a wealth of inaccirate and talmlous details the tragedy at Kerbela, became very popular. The parts of the murderers were naturally not sought after, as the actors who performed them ran some risk of losing their lives ; under Path Ah Shah use was made of batch™ oi .Russian jinsoners tor these undesirable parts. 6 . Under the rule of Nasir-ud-Din Shah the ta’zieh became a vast national spectacle. Huge buildings, such as the well-known “ M in Tehran, were erected as theatres to hold the vast concourse of spectators ; the Sliah m person attended the plays and distributed largesse. Perhaps the main lea,son for the Shah’s support was a desire to awaken and foster national hpnit. I here may also have been another reason—namely, a desire to obtain royal control of religion, and to defeat the power of the principal mullas. The ^ no \ approve of the ta’ziehs, at any rate in their elaborate form. Although they held firmly to the Shi’ah theology as developed bv the Mailisis and their i ollowers in Safavi times, they could not approve of plav-acting which was discountenanced by the prophet Muhammad and is eontrarv to all orthodox Muhammadan tradition. 7. The Pahlevi regime at first favoured both the la’ziehs and the other manifestations of mouring. In 1926, Muharram falling in Jidv, huge parades of troops were ordered, and whole regiments, led bv their officers, beat their naked chests, scourged themselves, chanted dirges, and generally performed the whole gamut of mourning ceremonies in strict discipline in the boiling sun. the head-cutters, who are for the most part cooks and house-servants who have taken a vow to cut their heads, were especially prominent in that year, and other bands of devoted mourners, with banners, coffins, imitation corpses, and all the para phernalia of the passion plays, went in procession through the streets of Tehran to the admiration of the populace. 8 . From that year onwards, the policy of the government has changed. Hiza Shah’s policy of agressive nationalism, centralised in the absolute authority of the throne, is incompatible with any vestige of secular power wielded by the mullas. The suppression of religions interference in politics which marches well with the wave of irreligion which seems to be invading the east, has progressed steadily. New roads have been built straight through venerated graveyards. Mullas who preached against the new marriage laws have been warned not to do it again, or have been exiled to another city. The Shah himself in 1927 penetrat- °d the mosque at Qum and had one of the preachers therein beaten for daring to reprove some members of his family. The police have received orders to beep a sharp look out on all “ rauzeh-khwanis ” and to report at once any attempt to introduce political matters in the religious exhortations. 9. In 1927 and 1928 the mourning ceremonies of the first ten days of Muharram were very strictly limited and controlled, though the rauzeh-khwanis were permitted. In 1929, however, a little more latitude was allowed, and pro cessions were allowed in the streets, subject to the restriction that certain well- known “ properties ” hitherto used in these processions (such as flags, decorated standards and led horses) should not be employed. The Shah in that year him self attended more than one meeting of the rauzeh-khwanis in the Government 44 Tekyeh ” and distributed largesse. The reason for this concession to popular sentiment was no doubt connected with the reactionary movement in Afghan istan. At Tabriz, in that year, the police themselves distributed a strictly limited number of swords to those who wished to cut their heads ; and the General Officer Commanding the troops publicly stated that he approved of these holy customs.10. The ceremonies in years subsequent to 1929 have bees once more curtail id and controlled, to an increasing extent each year. In 1934, the hollowing extracts from consular diaries show the amount of supervision in the pro vinces :— Kerman ,—The Muharram ceremonies in the latter part of the month passed off quietly, and the processions were less elaborate than hr previous years. Kennanshah .—This festival passed off very quietly as all big processions were forbidden. Resht .—All Government offices, etcetera, were closed and the people were mourning from the 23rd April to the 29ttu There was nothing important to report. Tabriz .—This year Muharram was very quiet and on the 10th day people who wanted to cut their* heads were ordered to do so outside the town. Meshed ,—In Meshed the Muharram ceremonies and processions were rigorously cut down and controlled and no untoward incident occurred. In Tehran too reports indicate that the ceremonies were less elaborate than in 1933. The police arranged that all processions should be watched and superintended, and no opportunity was given for the zealous to cut their heads. Bands or groups of mourners (dasteh) were allowed to circulate in some of the bazaars and in the south of Tehran, which is the more ancient part of the town area. The bands were more simple in form and appearances than in pre vious years. A certain amount of head-cutting apparently took place in a re mote and little-known mosque called the mosque of Imam-zadeh Zaid, and also in a place of pilgrimage or “ Immn-zadeh ” near $hah Abdul Azim ; no head cutting, however, took place in the village of Shah Abdul Azim itself. A servant employed in the Legation returned from the country village of Afche with the scalp religiously gashed. Rauzeh-khivanis wore permitted, but strictly super-, vised and all political references were forbidden. 1L On the occasion of the Shah’s birthday (March 15th 1934) the Persian Government, for the first time, organised, both in Tehran and in the principal provincial towns, very expensive celebrations, the most remarkable feature of which was a series of carnivals, called by the newly-manufactured Persian title of Karavan-i-Shadi ” (caravan of joy). A procession of elaborately decorated chariots, manned by actors and actresses, playing various instruments and gene rally acting the buffoon, passed through the streets on two successive davs. It was openly stated that these manifestations of national joy were designed to counterbalance, if not to replace, the national mourning which had gone on for so long. The joyous regime of Pahlevi, after so many years of misery and oppres sion, was worthy of gladness and merry-making ; the day of the oppressor was ended. . ]2 - The ShaiPs recent visit to Turkey may have added fuel to the flames of anti-religious zeal. 1 he r J urks, as Reza Shah must have seen for himself, have dealt much greater blows at vested religious interests, and gone much further in the suppression of religious interference in secular affairs, than the Persians, V ]&lt; ^ er struggle with the mujthids and mullas is yet ended is an open ques? tion, as the religious leaders have still a great deal of influence in the provinces and in the villages of Persia. But it seems certain that the official attitude of curtailment and control of the Muharram ceremonies will be pursued even more thoroughly in future years, ... (Received wider endorsement No. 174.)

The major sensation of the past week has been the further trial of th former Minister of Court, Teymourtache, and the simultaneous proceeding against the opium concessionnaire, Haji Mirza Habibullah Amin (formerly Amin-ut-Tujjar), on charges of bribery. The Persian press has evidently been instructed to publish the details of the trial in full, as every newspaner of importance has devoted many columns to verbatim reports of the aruu ments used. The fullest account is to be found in the newspaper Tran’' its reports arc still continuing, although judgment was issued on the evpn' ing of the 25th June, the second day of the trial.' 2 . The trial opened on Saturday morning, the 24th June, in the Criminal Court for Government Servants, under the presidency of Mirza Abdul Ali Khan Lutfi Larijani. The two accused were present in person accompanied by their advocates; for Teymourtache, Mirza Ahmad Khan Muqbil, and for Amin, three well known lawyers (one of them being the former Armenian deputy, Dr. Aghayan). The record states that Teymour tache gave his name as simply Abdul Hussain Teymourtache, and declared his age as fifty. When asked what his occupation was, he replied ‘None’ When pressed to give some occupation he replied that he was previously in Gov ernment service. As for his domicile, he gave it as ‘In prison’. 3. The accusation had been carefully prepared and took a long time to read. Teymourtache was accused of accepting from Amin a bribe amount- ing to nine thousand pounds, and two hundred thousand Rials and of defrandintc the Government of a like amount. Haji Amin was accused of f 1V tn S l tt&gt;e a r b °r-aT ntl T ed c SUmS ^ bril)es t0 a Government servant contrary to the law forbidding; bribery of government servants; of committing a breach of trust towards the government, and of embezzlement of a sum’of whole hUndre&lt;J th0USand Rlals the P r °P ert y of the Opium Concession as a tool- 't accllsed had pleaded not guilty, some preliminary fencing lmnal P W hi h J 7 He ex P Ialned to the President of the Tri bunal that he had received the sums mentioned in the accusation as a loan- the concessionnaire had gained a large sum from his monopoly of exncr ’ asked Xtr hThad ^^e to draw an advance When naid to him hv rhenno u re ‘; el P t '’ le re plied that the amounts were his si&lt;matnrp thereon r f s °f exchange, which could be produced with anyXangemeM as to inL r0 ° i When asked whether there was to be settled when the I r6S ’ 6 re phed that the question of interest was Finance.d 6 ^ G ° Ve “ the accusa e tions\ hC ^TdXsof U the 1 fiM ad0 ? l0ng statement in su PP or t &lt;&gt;f which the sums of ninp ^ ^ 6 ^? ancia ^ 0 P er ations in the course of were paid over are comnlipot ^ an&lt; ^ ^ wo ^ unc ^ re d thousand Rials r ent o the nuhlic nro'^ u and 1 Wl11 not ‘rouble you with a full state- .^;^t :raHe? “LXw’ , Br ^&gt; th ey amount to Government, through Teymourtache r gra ', te » 1 . n Oct ober, 1930, the one hundred and fifty thousand pounds worth^f that l 1167 reql l‘ red Tomans to the Pound As the Pound ° f ? xchan S e at the rate of six stated that such an operatmn was mpass . e ihe d' t0 'd ' 0 T T anS ’ d^’d to fify thousand Pounds and certain n?he V h . demand was then reduced in the end, no exchange’ was actuallv snW a&lt; !

I told the Minister for Foreign Affairs when onenine the discussion of the matter, that the tone of his note suggested to mv mind that he hardly appreciated my great desire to prevent the impri sonment of two British subjects in Tehran from developing into an ugly incident» In view of the Moscow tri^l, public opinion in Great Britain would be immediately roused if it were known that British subjects had remained for some considerable time in prison without trial and without being allowed to enjoy the protection of their consular representative; more over^ public opinion would be quite unwilling to believe that the words ''les consuls ou leurs representants auront, en se conformant aux reglements des prisons, la permission de les visiter/’ did not bear their perfectly plain and obvious meaning. 2 Feroughi intimated that he fully realised the necessity of avoiding an incident, touched on, but without pressing, the arguments which may be adduced in favour of the Persian thesis, and suggested that I had incorrectly understood that the Persian authorities had definitely refused to allow the prisoners to be visited. 3 . In justification of my use of the word ‘refused’’ in the case of Mr, Townshend-Smith, to which Feroughi had objected in his note, I went through the time table of the case: He was interrogated by the police as long ago as the 28th February; the case must therefore have been in prepara tion for some considerable time and there was no justification for a pro tracted instruction. He was arrested on the 5th April. On the 10th Ann! I reonested that immediate arrangements be made for Mr. Trott to visit him.' On the 12th April police headquarters had informed the head of the English Section of his Ministry that there would be no objection to such a visit provided a representative of the “juge d’instruction” accompanied Mr. Trott. The following day, however, the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Justice informed us that under section 120 of the Police Regula tions a visit could not be allowed. He explained that the parquet authorised by that section to refuse visits to be paid to persons in prison if there was a reason to suspect that such a visit might be the occasion of conspiracy to defeat the ends of justice. Finding we had no copy of these Prison Regulations we asked the Ministry of Justice to furnish us with one, which that department was unable to do. It suggested that we apply to the parquet or to the police. Application to both these authorities provea ,nnavailing and it was only this morning that Jelal had undertaken to supp y a copy. 4. Feroughi listened very patiently, and said that there had perljap» been delav, but he imagined I had received his message that the visi Mr. Townshend-Smith was to be permitted on Saturday next. I saifl a had, but why Saturday and why not to-day, to-morrow or Friday? 5. I then turned to the Parsons case, and said that in my note of t ^ 5 th April I had asked five perfectly simple questions which the P° lce have answered in five minutes by telephone, if they had chosen to o _ The word “disregarded,” which had also been, considered objection there(pre seemed to me to be fully justified. 6 . I then went on to say that I knew his Highness did not welcome mention of the Rashidi case (see my despatch No. 82 of the 25th re 1933), but seeing that he had been in prison for over two montns ^ any instruction apparently having been completed against him, his ca124 of material interest if the view of the Persian Government was that the -judi cial authorities were authorised to refuse to allow a consul to visit any person in prison until the instruction had been completed. Apart from that aspect ot the matter his Highness had promised as long ago as the 13th February Ivr eil nL U1T ] e 1 I V :0 case, and it was only a day or two ago that Jelal informed Mr. ! rott that Kashidi was “a notoriously bad character.” If this were so it seemed to me strange that, throughout the twenty-three vears that he had frequented the Legation, none of our Persian visitors, who in the past were numerous, ever suggested either to Mr. Havard or to Mr. Trott that he was an undesirable. Feroughi (whose demeanour strongly confirmed my previous belief that the only reason why the man has been imprisoned is that he came to the Legation frequently) replied that the fact that he had been imprisoneo showed that the authorities viewed him with disfavour and that I should cease to interest myself in his fate. I said that a more seemly method of dealing with us would have been to give a hint that it was prefer able that his visits be discontinued. 7. I then asked his Highness whether he had read your speech in the House of Commons on the Moscow trial. He said he had not done so. I told him that I had brought a copy of the Times with me in which I had marked certain passages which I thought would adequately explain to hi/n the very definite anxiety which I felt about the matter under discussion. He must clearly understand that I was not suggesting that there was resemblance between the methods of the Ogpu and those of the Persian police; he would, moreover, see from the character of the passages which I had marked that this was not my intention. Feroughi said he would read it with interest. 8 . Finally I told his Highness that I found the activities of the police were rather alarming, and in justification of that statement I j^ave Lim a bowdlerised version of a paragraph in Mr. Palmer’s politicar diary for March, Section A. 9. Mr. Palmer’s actual report was as follows: — “The town 'police, upon fresh orders from Tehran, are extra zealous over checking all intercourse between suspected pro-Bolsheviks and other inhabitants. ”1 myself went to an Armenian house in a car to fetch some new lamp-shades made for us to my wife’s specification and urgent ly needed for a big party we were giving next day. ‘‘It turned out that the good lady—the only person in the town capable of making anything reasonably decorative—had a husband, working away in Tehran, who was suspected of Bolshevik sympathies., *‘I learnt later that after my visit she had been subjected to a long cross-examination by the police commissary of the quarter, who refused to believe that—as the matter was urgent—I had merely literally obeyed my wife’s orders ‘not to leave without the shades.’ One was not ready and I waited about an hour while the lady and her two little sisters aged about 8 or 9 finished it. The commissary wanted all details of the conversation !”- 10 . I added that this meant that it was apparently a part of the normal duties of the police to watch the comings and goings of a British consular officer, to note what houses he visited and how long he stayed in them, and then to go and interrogate the occupants of the house. As was to be ex pected, Feroughi gave the Russian hare a run, saying that, while ne doubt British consuls were “all honourable men,” other official representatives could not be so described. It was perhaps well that the police should keep a watch on the doings of all indiscriminately; they would then gradually learn to divide the sheep and the goats, and so far as we were concerned matters would certainly gradually return to normal. And when all was said and 187(0 F&amp;PD125 ] done it was .not often that British subjects were arrested. I terminated this part of my conversation by replying that there were not many British subjects in Persia. 11 . My general impression was that to some extent Feroughi was ge nuinely distressed at the failure to deal more promptly with the two cases under discussion, but I think that the undoubted concern which he showed was mainly inspired by the desire that nothing should be done fo spoil the ‘'atmosphere” (a word of which we are getting tired) in which the Anglo- Persian Oil Company negotiations are to be conducted. Enclosure 1 to S. No. (96). Mr. Hoare to M. Feroughi. Tehran, April 17, 1933. M. le Ministre, As your Highness is presumably aware, two British subjects resident in Tehran have for some time past been in prison here. 2 . I have addressed your Highness officially with regard to both cases; I have expressed my wish that a member of this Legation shall interview one of them and have made enquiries about the other. 3. It has become necessary for me to report to His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom that my request has been refused in one case and my enquiries disregarded in the other. 4. Paragraph 7 of the note from the Persian Government to my predeces sor of the 10 th May, 1928 states with a plainness which appears to me to be complete that ‘les consuls ou leurs reprdsentants auront, en se conformant aux rbglements des prisons, la permission de les visiter” (“les” are impri soned British subjects). 5. If 1 receive a reply to this note by midday on Wednesday, the 19th April, I shall be prepared to incorporate it in my telegram to the Secretary of State. 6 . If I have not received a reply by the date indicated I shall presume that the Persian Government will forthwith telegraph to the Persian Lega tion in London the interpretation which they desire, in justification of their refusal of my request, to place on the passage which I have had the honour to quote. 7. Your Highness will be pleased to understand that my one desire is to handle any issue that may arise, or may be occasioned, in such a manner as to avoid conflict. The success of my endeavour is obviously dependent on the effective goodwill of your Highness’s Department. I avail, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. Enclosure 2 to S. No. (96). M. Feroughi to Mr. Hoare. (Translation.) M. le Ministre, Tehran, April 18, 1933. T have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency 9 note in regard to two British subjects who are under detention. Your Excellency writes that your request that a member of your lega tion should visit one of them was refused and your enquiries in the case o the other were disregarded.I cannot imagine in any way that your Excellency is .justified in using the two words “refusal” and “disregarded” in connexion with any of the two abovementioned persons, because in respebt of the first case, when Mr. Trott, the Legation’s oriental secretary, came to the English Section for the carrying out of your request, t.e.-, his visiting Townshend-Smith, explana tions were given to him on the 12th April, 1933, after telephonic conversa tion with the concerned quarters for finding out the exact course to follow, to the effect that in accordance with the Prison Regulations permission for visiting him could not be issued so long as his cross-examination has not been concluded; it was stated that after a few days, when those cross- examinations were concluded, time will be fixed for Mr. Trott to go and see him. I cannot see therefore how this answer could be termed “refusal.” In the case of the second person, as this Ministry was not acquainted with what was enquired about, the matter was referred to the concerned quarters in order that your Excellency may be informed of any explanation which may be given. The point on which we were expecting explanations from the concerned quarters was explained to Mr. Trott by the English Sec tion on the telepphone on Thursday, the 13th April. Under the above circumstances 1 trust that your Excellency would admit that the word “disregard” cannot be rightly used in this case. As regards the circular of the 10 th May, 1928, all of the sections of which were extracts from the general laws of the country sent to the foreign Legations out of the general laws as a preliminary information, no step has been taken contrary to the purport of its article 7, because article 7 states that the consuls or their representatives are allowed, subject to the regula tions of prisons, to visit foreign nationals in their prisons. Moreover, in thccase of Townshend-Smith, as has been laid down above, it was mentioned that, since the regulations concerning prisons do not permit any interviev/s during the preliminary investigation, it is necessary that the representative of that Legation should wait a few days until the preliminary examination of the person referred to comes to an end. While mentioning the foregoing matters and explanations, I must express my extreme regret at your complaints and your opposition; I cannot imagine any reason for them. And in my view the tone of your above- mentioned Icttei is, to my regret, incompatible with the expressions contain ed in paragraph 7 thereof. At all events, I hope that these written explanations, which are all true, will remove all misunderstandings and mistakes. I avail, &amp;c.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran to the Foreign Office, London, No. 222, dated the 6th May 1933.

It appears that the National Bank is prosecuting Dr. Lindenblatt and demanding the restitution of 1 , 200,000 rials only, although the total estimated losses of the bank amount to 2 million rials. 3. Moreover, the Department of Commerce is reported to be prosecuting Dr. Lindenblatt for malversation of 3 million rials spent in connexion with the Karaj and Karisek sugar factories. 4^ Dr. Lindenblatt has been living for some time in great destitution and his health and nerves are said to have been seriously affected. It is still something of a mystery why he returned to Persia, -and there is no doubt that he did so in the face of clear warnings from his friends. 5, Though under arrest, Dr. Lindenblatt pays frequent visits to the National Bank under heavy guard, presumably in order to give further assistance in the investigations.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 261, dated the 1st June 1933. In continuation of my despatch No. 154 of April 6 th, (not received) I have the honour to inform you that the Minister for Foreign Affairs told me the other day that the influx into Persia of refugees from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was increasing.- 2 . I caused enquiry to be made of His Majesty’s Consular Officers at Meshed and Tabriz, and I now have the honour to enclose copies of their reports. 3. Major Daly confirms His Highness’ statement that the refugees are becoming more numerous, while Mr ; Palmer’s despatches show that, there is a growing tendency to deport refugees from Azerbaijan to the south. P • S .—In amplification of Major Daly’s despatch, I have the honour to enclose an extract from the Meshed Consulate-General diary for the month of April. Lnclo. I to S. No. (98). Despatch from the British Consulate, Tabriz, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 58, dated the 10th May 1933. I have the honour'to confirm that, while refugees from Russia have from time to time been deported southwards from here, the remainder of those Avbo had entered Persia without passports or visas and were resident at I abriz were deported from here in March as reported in my No. 21 confi dential of March 14th. The main difference over this expulsion was that for the first time no distinction was made between those who had found work here and those who had not, 2. The reasons governing this decision were probably twofold:— (a) The chief one was the fear of more Bolshevik Agents having crept in in the guise of refugees. (?d The very real one of the already greatly increased cost of living**This latter has been gone into under a separate heading in my April Diary; and it will suffice to say that there was a bad harvest last year, and following the severe winter just experienced there is every prospect of a worse one this year. Prices are already considerably higher than last year: there has been much mortality among live-stock, there is a pronounced shortage of fodder, and bread is higher than it has been for 15 years. 3. Under these circumstances any very pronounced increase in the influx of refugees would naturally be serious for this Province. But the increase does not appear to be very serious as yet. 4 . Naturally it would be awkward for the Chief of Public Security to be cited as against his Tehran superiors; but he says :— (a) That about 500 'persons who had crossed near Khudafirin, Bilasavar etc. had accumulated in Ardabil and other places during the winter. It had only recently been possible to send them southwards, the roads having been more or less blocked previously. (b) This sudden arrival of the above 500 might have been interpreted as all new arrivals, whereas they really represented those of 3 or 4 months. These refugees were mixed, but mainly Tartar. (c) While the above refugees could' only be described as individuals, there was now a tendency towards whole families attempting to cross. Some such families were known to be near the river awaiting an oppor tunity, and the Persian guards were on the look out for them—not to turn them back, but to handle them. (d) The plan was now followed of dividing refugees into two classes and disposing of them accordingly:— 1. Agriculturists: Sent to Sineh, Sakiz, Kermanshah, etc. 2. Artificers and Craftsmen: Sent to the South-Isfahan, Kashan, etc. None were sent to f ehran or allowed to pass through Tehran or Tabriz, but sent via Mianeh and for Sineh etc via Mianeh-Maraghah. 5. The above would scarcely as yet seem to justify this influx being described as having assumed dangerous proportions. But the remarks about whole families awaiting opportunities to cross are probably quite correct, and may point to a large recrudescence of such escapes into Persia.) 6 . One gathers that conditions during the last winter in the Caucasus must have been almost incredibly terrible. I have in the last few days so frequently heard stories of actual canni balism—i.e., of families exchanging and eating their respective children— that I feel forced to report these persistent rumours as possibly having a. basis of truth. 7. The continued influx of emigrants from the Ukraine and elsewhere must alone be enough to account for an ever increasing overflow from the Caucasus in the directions of Persia, Turkestan, and Turkey. 8 . There is doubt that emigrations to Turkey also continue steadily. Undo. II to S. No. (98). Letter from British Consulate Tabriz to His Majesty’s Minister Tehran, No. 60, dated the 12th May 1933. 1 have the honour to report that on May Uth about 50 refugees—mixed Moslems Armenians and Russians including 4 women arrived a a nz from Julfa under Military escort and are at present in custody at tne barracks. 187 V C) F&amp;PDAfter the usual preliminary enquiries, they will be handed over to the civil police for disposals 2. The above would seem to contradict my statement in my report 58 that “refugees were never sent nowadays via Tabriz”; but this seeming discre pancy is because these refugees entered Persia near Julfa—from where there* is only the one obvious road^—and not at Khudafirin or Bilasavar. 3. Crossings near Julfa are unusual, as there, are more guards near there, while the river is deep and the banks, are steep slopes and exposed to fire; while near Khudafirin and Bilasavar the river is shallow and the banks are easier. 4. During the escapes of 4 or 5 of the present refugees the Russian Frontier Guards fired and their bullets naturally fell in Persian territory—, whereupon the Persian frontier guards fired into Russian territory as a Fieply. Tbeie were no casualties. Enclo. Ill to S. No. (98). Letter from British- Consulate Tabriz to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 69, dated the 19th May 1933. With further reference to my recent reports concerning the deportation of refugees, I have the honour to state that these continue—especially from Tabriz. A further 70 or 80—mostly Moslem Tartars settled in the Davachi Quarter— were deported to the South on May 17th. 2. In connection with these expulsions one version has it that the Rus sians—who certainly at one time viewed the presence of anti-Soviet Tartar and Armenian elements near the frontier with great uneasiness— have deliberately engineered a “raid” bv some of them in order to enable themselves to insist on the deportation of all. 3. According to thia version - 16 refugees were collected, who included a few Russian agents-provp- cateurs, tfu j rest being indigent Tartars from the Caucasus. They were given arms and money, and through these agents—provocateurs a “raid” on Russian territory was organized. Before the group reached the Araxes the Soviets reported their expedi tion to the Persian Authorities whose Frontier Guards captured all of these men. This occurred on May 8 th. Immediately upon this the Russians complained at Tehran and an order came the same day to deport all refugees from Azerbaidjan, and espe cially from Tabriz. The. Soviets tried to throw the responsibility of this matter upon the local anti-Soviet elements and especially upon the Armenian Dashnag. the latter h,ad knovrn of this plan previously and had warned all Armenian refugees pot to take part in any such “expedition” threatening to shoot any one who did so. They could thus not be implicated in the charges whieb) the Soviets tried! to bring against them. 4. My informant continues: There is moreover the regrettable fact that while the genuine anti-Bolshevik refugees are deported, the Soviets manage, by bribery etc., to secure exemption for those “refugeesV who ar?/ in reality their agents. The condition of these deported refugees is reported to be terribly, especially that of the Christians (Armenians, Russians, Assyrians etc.) ana letters received here from them—from Zinjan, Kazyin etc.—beg for help,- 5. The whole of the above 16 men were disarmed and brought here 4^-5- days after the incident and were deported; so that in this case the Soviet' are presumed to have been unable to save their agents—even if they.wantsto do so. They may, moreover, prove useful as propagandists in the centres to which they have been deported, with the official reputation of being ardent enemies of the Soviets. 6 . I have reported the above statement under all reserve, and confess that I am quite unable to express any opinion as to its credibility. 7. My other information is that the Dashnag here have an Agent among the Soviets whom the latter believe to be their man. Through this man the Soviets expect to receive Dashnag &gt;, information about the Rowanduz Route; and the Dashnag intended to give them false information, while their agent will thus be introduced to those of the G. P. U. Staff working* along the Rowanduz line, and will learn their intentions in order to defeat them. 8 . Refugees continue to arrive from Russia every day and they all share the lot of the deported, generally under bad conditions. 9. Copy to Bagdad under 422/21/33, via H. M.

Extract from Meshed Consulate-General Diary for the month of April 1933. 2. Refugees .—The severe famine in Russia,has given rise to an unpre cedented influx of refugees. The Soviet have apparently relaxed efforts to* stop these destitute people from crossing the border. The problem is becom ing increasingly serious for the Persians and it is understood' that instruc tions have recently been received to close the frontier as far as* possible against all Russian refugees, and the military posts on the frontier are being still further strengthened. Reports indicate that a considerable number of refugees are being turned back at the frontier. Accurate figures are not available but it is certain that very large numbers of Turcomans are entering Persia. 250/300 families are known to have arrived during April and individual refugees in large numbers. 16 Russians and 6 women entered Persia on the 23rd. There have certainly been very many more but figures cannot be obtained. A large number of Persian subjects resident in Russia have also returned to Persia. A Per sian Turk refugee, who recently arrived in Meshed from Askabad relates a gruesome story. He declares that an Armenian Restaurant Keeper at Askabad murdered 9 persons (presumably persons intending to- cross the frontier) in 40 days, and served the flesh of the bodies in the restaurant. He has at last been detected and arrested. Refugees are now,being subjected to a very strict examination and only those who are considered to be free of any suspicion of being G. P. U. agents are brought into Meshed.. The fate of suspected persons is not known—they are probably kept in local prisons pending instructions^Although actual figures are not forthcoming, enquiries from many sources lead me to the conclusion that since Christmas not less than 3000 Turkomans and 500/600 Russians must have entered Persia via the Khorassan frontiers. 3 . The Famine in Russia .—Reports of cannibalism in Russia have been received from widely differing sources. Railway stations are packed with helpless and starving people. It is stated that periodically tnese are searched and identification documents demanded. The majority are unable to produce such documents and are placed in locked goods wagons and sent out into desert land, being provided with neither food nor water. The corpses are subsequently thrown out into the desert, and others are disposed of by drowning in the Oxus. These reports are so general that, even allowing for exaggeration, they must have a good deal of real foundation. A pood of flour is said to cost 400 Roubles. A certain amount of wheat is being smuggled from Khorassan and sold at hi&lt;di prices. The quantity is insignificant and the Persians are at present fn efrvn it. as monev is so scarce in the province that it is welcomed from any source. Soviet troops near the frontier, at any rate, and according to some reports elsewhere, are becoming dissatisfied and in many cases are not now issued with ammunition, rioting presumably being feared. At Merv large numbers are said to be existing only by eating grass. (99) Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, to Foreign Office / London, No. 341, dated Tehran the 14th July 1933. (Copies to India No. 138, Baghdad No. 53.) During the last three months I have had much cause to reflect upon the astonishing changes which have come to pass in Persia since I country in 1921. The Annual Reports on Persia have fully recorded a sequence of dynastic and political changes of ever increasing national sell- consciousness and consequent relinquishment under pressure of the secular privileges, capitulatory fiscal and commercial, formerly enjoyed by the Luro- pean Powers in this country/ Great Britain having more to lose, except perhaps Russia, has suffered most in the process, but generally speaking the *‘faranghi” from having been looked upon with respect tempered with disiiKe as a phenomenon sent as a trial by an all-seeing God to a race of true e i evers has now lost his novelty and owing mainly to the war and to the Russian revolution, sunk to the level of an ordinary mortal with human weaknesses which can be usefully exploited and sins which can be purged in Kasr Kajar. 2. All these political developments do not need recapitulation. v object in this despatch is rather to convey an idea of the rapid evolu ion Persia towards western social methods. The picture presented by re today is as different now from that of the immediate post-war^ period as Cezanne from a Rubens. The subject and its underlying ideas ni a y similar, but the technique and method of expression has completely chang 3. To begin with feudalism has disappeared with the Kajars. t i* true that even now an occasional scion of a noble house manages to get o i * but, as one of them remarked to me recently, there are only two ‘‘gennem in the Cabinet now, the Prime Minister and the Minister of War, bo them nonenties. Gone are the days when Kajar Princes succeeded another in the high positions of state; instead of the Ain-ed-Dowlens * Tfarman Farmas of former times we find Feroughi and Tahizadeh, W . 1 » Q Shah’s chamberlain is now one Bahman, a man who might easily be mistma 4^ Vi2 for a carpet merchant, and the President of the Mejliss, His Excellency Dadgar started life as a servant. The new dynasty has in fact done rather what the Tudor dynasty did in England, eliminated the old aristocracy and created a new one from that lower middle class from which the Pahlevi Shah himself has risen. In ten years the power of the tribal chieftains has been broken, the tribes disarmed and their leaders brought to Tehran to grace the Pahlevi triumph: Sheikh Khazal, Soulet-et-Dowleh, Kawam-ul-Mulk and the Bakhtiari Khans are all in Tehran and may not leave the city except to visit the esta tes near by which the luckier of them have succeeded in exchang ing for the homes of their ancestors. “We Bakhtiaris”, said Serdar Mohtashem to me the other day, “used to be great fellows for horses and &gt;vomen and hunting, but now our boys are becoming tennis champions instead’ ’ 1 4. New men connote new manners. Greetings which used to entail an elaborate and polite pantomime of enquiry after the august health are now curt and European: the compliments which interlarded correspondence are almost entirely lacking and have been discouraged in official correspondence by Royal Command. Dignity has vanished with the abba and impudence has appeared with the Pahlevi hat. The frock coat formerly honoured for its use in concealing the less mentionable parts of man’s anatomy, is quite obsolete and the short and shameless jacket has replaced it. Even the Pahlevi hat is lemoved whenever a man is indoors, though it is amusing to notice that at the entrance to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs the commo dious hatrack is still only used for walking sticks. 5 . Now and then a mullah may still be seen bravely flaunting his turban, but it is now the mere emblem of a by-gone age, for the political power of the priesthood is broken irrevocably. The Shah is supposed to be benevolent ly disposed towards religion in principle but not towards its grosser mani festations. A royal camel is still, I am told, slaughtered on the Moslem Day of Sacrifice because the prophet so ordained it, but the head cutting of Moharrem and the more picturesque folklore of the Passion play, pagan superstitions, have been suppressed with a firm hand, and strangely little protest has hitherto been heard. Vosuk-ed-Dowleh tells me that Teymour- tache was a strong supporter of the Shah in his successful assault upon the pretensions of the mujtahids, but that they would ne\er ave collapsed without a struggle had they not been most worthless creatures. Forty years ago the Shiah «divines both m Persia and ’Iraq were men whose saintly lives, commanded respect tor their cloth, but recently they have beeen merely turbaned rascals, ^ho se notorious manner of living has destroyed the respect of their flocks. Ilius in the big towns even the poorer classes are losing their faith as they seem already to have lost their fanaticism. Nine years ago the American Major Imbrie was murdered in the streets of Tehran for photographing a religious scene • todav one may enter mosques in Isfahan and Tehran and even ^ake photographs there. It is true that outside the larger towns the priesthood still lfave P great influence and the grossest superstitions and bigotry will continue to be foisted upon the illiterate peasants until the gradual spread of education makes itself felt. Thus recently in a village near Qum an ignorant Seyyid by virtue of a few lucky cures established a reputation for miracle working and convinced his fellow villagers that he was the twelfth Trmm on the strength of which his followers murdered a dozen or more “unbelievers” in the°public bath of the village. I believe, all the same, that the decav of reli-ion will spread from the cities to the countryside. An intelligent member of the Qaragozloo family remarked to me recently that there was a grave danger inherent in this decay of religion . nothing is taking its place save nationalism and a spurious and insolent pay^m The wav i« in fact being paved for Communism or anarchy when the strong ha of the WMuerorts eventually removed. On the other hand it may be argued that Idam'has never really been the faith of Persta. the Shiah her^y has left scope for the even wilder heresies of Sufism and Bahaism . 1 ersians 187(C) F&amp;PDhave ever been poets and philosophers rather than pillars of the Faith. The trouble is, however, that in the modern rush there is no time for philosophy when engineering has to be studied, no time for poetry when Marlene Dietrich is exhibiting her incomparable legs at the Iran Cinema, The students at the German Industrial School, according to their Director, Dr. Strunck, used a few years back to be serious and keen to learn. Each year now sees a deterioration. The young men now think they know more than their teachers and are impatient of guidance. 6 . The visitor to Tehran still finds delight in the eternal view of Demavend crowning the Elburz, but man has done his best to alter all but the most immoveable natural landmarks. Already at Kerej the traveller has passed a large and outwardly up-to-date sugar factory and agricultural college. Outside the city gate he will see the military aerodrome, inside the city the imposing red motor watering-carts of the Municipality (although he may also still notice men spraying the streets from goatskins!). The new streets are as wide as Whitehall, and some are even paved with stone blocks, but the houses on either side of them are mostly one-storied shops, here and there varied by something more imposing in two stories with Persepolitan Stucco pillars. Such parts of the older city as still remain are in the hands of the housebreaker: the Lord Mayor is a General and loves straight lines so that the lay-out of the city will soon be as Symmetrical as the modern American town. : The new quarter near the Shah’s new palace is certainly neat and clean and electrically lit, albeit somewhat uncertainly. There are one-way traffic and coloured light signals: horse drawn traffic may not pass through certain streets save at dead of night: camels, those symbols of the bad old days, are rigorously excluded. Twelve years ago there was no hotel or restaurant to which a European could decently go; now there are several which while of comparatively humble design are, I am told, quite habitable. Formerly there were no places of entertainment: now there are several cinemas and night clubs where the jazz of several years ago is discoursed by Persian orchestras. Plans are afoot for a national theatre and for a museum of antiquities. Tehran is, in fact, to be a modern capital worthy of a nation which considers itself inferior to none and the Lord Mayor, who has never travelled abroad, is said to be aiming at an improvement on Paris! 7. Outside Tehran the most obvious manifestation of the new regime is the system of roads—not good in the English sense, but mostly metalled and fit for motor traffic, where formerly there were merely mule tracks. The American Minister recently travelled from Meshed to Tehran in seventeen hours: it is true that he was a nervous wreck for a week afterwards but the mere fact of this rapid journey shows how much progress has been made. Tabriz can also now be reached in one long day, as can Kermanshah, Isfa han, Resht and Meshed-i-Sar. The railway will really be superfluous, but it is a matter of amour propre for the Shah, even though it means putting sugar and tea beyond the meagre means of the peasant, and unless a cataclysm occurs it will probably be connecting Tehran with the Caspian coast four years from now and carrying jaded townspeople for a week-end at the newest place. 8 . All these developments have been rendered possible by the vastly improved public finances of the country. In 1919 Vosuk-ed-Dowleh, as he has himself told me, knew not where to turn to find the wherewithal to pay the troops and the civil service. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company had paid no royalties : the Government were bound by treaties not to raise the customs tariff: internal sources of revenue had almost ceased to exist owing to the poverty caused by the war. Today a Minister of Finance can count on a steady revenue from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company alone worth ten times the whole revenue from all sources which accrued to the Imperial Treasury twenty five years ago. Apart from oil revenues there are the hugely increased customs duties resultant from the complacency of the foreign Powers ^ho formerly insisted on a low tariff. Monopolies of various kinds bring further sums to the exchequer, and Persia, almost unique amongst nations has uo154 '-W ” ^ (116) Memorandum from the British Legation, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 306, dated the 26th June 1933.

In continuation of my despatch No. 394 of September 10th, 1932 [S. No. (60) in F. No. 1-M./321, I have the honour to report that the Oriental Secretary to this Legation has been informed privately of the death of Soulat ed Dowleh (Ismail Khan Qashgai, also called Sardar (Ashair) in Qasr-i-Qajar prison, apparently from some form of heat stroke which may or may not have been deliberately caused. 2. Soulat’s eldest son Muhammad Nasir Khan is still in prison but Mr. Trott learns that arrangements had practically been completed for the release of both father and son. 1 3. It remains to be seen what effect, if any, the loss of their best-known chief will have on the Qashgai tribe. The latter are at present under a military governor and it appears probable that most of the tribe will not take much notice of Soulat’s decease: He was by far the cleverest and most intriguing of the Qashgai Khans and his removal should facilitate the Gov ernment’s avowed policy of turning the wild nomadic tribesmenv into tame sedentary Persian nationals. &lt; 4. The newspaper “Shafaq-i-iSurkh” of the 31st July gave a detailed account of the way in which the brave Persian troops compelled Ali Khan, Soulat’s half-brother, to cease his rebellious activities in Fars and to give himself up to the troops; and ten days later the same paper announced that two other dangerous rebels, named Sadiq Mulla and Ghulam Ali, had also surrendered at Shiraz. The impression given by these reportsI 155 is that the central government has made progress in its policy of subdu' unruly elements in Ears. This impression is confirmed and strengthened the welcome and rather unexpected news that the Persian Governm t have no objection to the proposed archaeological tour of Sir Aurel Ste' during the coming autumn, thoughh is route lies in areas which haw hitherto been regarded as unsafe for travellers. 1 ( 118 ) {Received on 26th August 1933, with Political Secretary's letter No 22 dated 10th August 1933.)

M.’s CHARGE D AFFAIRES, 1EHRAN, TO Foreign Office, London, No. 328, dated 1st July 1933. You will be aware that until quite recently it was necessary for al) persons who exported goods or produce from Persia to sell to the Persian Government foreign exchange to the value of the goods or produce so export ed, or else give an undertaking to do so within a specified time. Certain authorised banks were charged with the duty of buying this foreign exchange on behalf of the Government, and holding it at the disposal of those persons who wished to pay for foreign goods imported on the strength of export certificates. For the greater part of the time that the scheme was in operation, the rate of purchase was fixed, more or less arbitrarily, by the Government.! 2. When dealings in “exporters’ exchange” were made free, as report ed in Sir R. Hoare’s despatch No. 271 of the 3rd June last [S. No. (86) in F.-3-N./31J, the banks were given an assurance against loss in respect of their accumulated foreign exchange, of which the Imperial Bank of Persia and the National Bank held very large deposits L especially in United States dollars. I have no exact information as to the amount of these holdings to-day, but there are said to be 1,500,000 dollars alone, the holdings of the National Bank in all currencies being about four times as great as those of the Imperial Bank of Persia.! 3. When this assurance was given, the Government can hardly have foreseen that, in addition to the appreciation of the rial, they would be confronted with the quite separate problem of the continued fall in the value of the dollar. -The result of the latter is that the banks have paid a much larger sum in rials for their holdings of dollars than they or the Gov ernment can realise by their sale at the present time, and the problem that faces the Government is how this loss can best be averted or diminished. 4. As the internal purchasing power of the various currencies remains about the same, the problem would not be so great if the Persian Govern ment were prepared to keep these holdings to pay for the pui^hascs that sooner or later they will want to make in most of the countries concerned; but they do not, apparently, feel able to leave such, large sums lying idle for so long, and other schemes have been examined.'. 5. One of these, so the Minister of Finance has told the chief manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, was to make the merchant community bear all the loss, presumably by reinstituting a control of foreign exchange rates, on the ground that they would have had to bear it under a system of free exchange. Ihe cases are hardly parallel, but it was anyhow decided that, if the Government did this, people would say that, when exchange was con trolled, the Government took all the profits and made the merchants bear all the loss.; 6. Taghizadeh said that there was no truth in a report to the effect that t e overnment proposed to make the import of American cars conditional on the purchase by the importer of dollar exchange at the old rates, or to ma e any sort of monololy of exchange. The report probably arose fr° m he intention of the Government to import all at once a large quantity of mo or lorries, of which it stood in need, in order to secure a reduction in cost oy a large order. In this connexion, however, it will be noted that in the import quotas just published for the current economic year, no provision was made for cars and trucks, and the intentions of the Government in this matter are awaited with considerable interest.7. Mr. Wilkinson, when asked for his opinion, suggested that the Gov- ''S' 1 * ma -ke importers take over the foreign exchange at the old , ^ ’ b “ t recompense the purchasers by increasing the quotas of certain arti- C ' e ^ nd / l0Wln S th f art , lcles lm P orter in this way to benefit by reduced annefr! ^ utles - 1 a S h |2adeh was much interested in this proposal, but it nmhfhitpn* ?■ , iat ftnles \ th - e Government will admit what are at present ren^Hn^i l tlC eS ’ SC ' heiI ! e wlU hardl y work - Th e quota for the cur rent financial year is larger than the last, and the demand for the goods on this quota cannot be capable of much expansion. th« Jiw ,! 1 . 1 gl r d t0 k 6 able t'. re PO rt that the Government do not contemplate the adoption of one very obvious expedient, that of making the banks bear ® - P 68 ', Wilkinson has had some anxious moments, for he has been urging the Government to take the foreign exchange off his hands ever since it WH f gan i t0 K d : Pre a iate - F ° r a tme the Minist ry of Finance weretoopara /nnf ^ a day ° r tW ° ??° Ta S hlzade h gave him a categorical assur- ,+ wc th v! t th ^ G ° V .T“ W0 V i pay for the exchange at the rates, at which it was bought.

The first is the fact that on a recent visit to the new road from Tehran via Karaj to the Caspian Sea at Chalus, His Majesty caused all traffic on the road to be forbidden. The Shah’s journey only took three days, as he left on the 6th August and returned on the 8th usuch a short time the interference with commerce was negligible, a* nardly any traffic of a commercial nature makes use of the road yet.

The second indication of a certain nervousness is the fact that no announcement has yet appeared in the local press of the death in prison of ISaulat-ud-Dowleh, which has been reported by me separately. Everybody in Tehran knows that he is dead, and that his corpse has been deposited at 5Shah Abdul Azim pending its ultimate removal to the Hcly Shrines in ’Iraq. Whether the absence of an official announcement means that he did not die a natural death (the widow, at any rate, seems to’ think that he was murdered), or that the effect on the Qashqai tribe will be undesirable, is uncertain. The omission seems purely stupid and, in view of the fact that the death took place at about the time of His Majesty’s absence from the capital, may perhaps be yet another instance of the failure of any Persian Government official to take any responsibility on himself. &lt;125) I ' (Received on 7th October 1933, with Political Secretary's letter No. 38, dated 21st September 1933.)

I I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a letter and memorandum that the Imperial Bank of Persia have just received from the Minister of Finance on the subject of the Ministry’s claim that the banK should not have taken income-tax paid in the United Kingdom ir^to account before calculating the “net profits’’ on which the royalty of 6 per cent, was payable to the Persian Government in past years^ The royalty came to an end in 1930, at the time of the cancellation of the bank’s right to issue notes ( see article 2 (2) of Appendix No. 5 to the bank’s concession signed on the 13th May, 1930], but the Ministry’s claim is in respect of all years between 1889 and that date. During many of these years the royalty would not have reached the minimum figure of £4,000 which the bank was obliged to pay in any circumstances, even if United Kingdom income-tax had been taken into account after, instead of before, the net profits were calculated; but making all allowances for these years the sums involved would be likelv to prove very considerable.! 2. I understand that the chief manager would like his board to take the dispute to arbitration if the Ministry persist in pressing this claim. 3.

HASSAN TAGHI ZADEII. (Seal of the Ministry of Finance.) Enclosure 2 to S. No. (125). Memorandum on the Mode of Computation of the Dues Payahhle by the Imperial Dank of Persia to the Persian Government. (a) The General Revenue Department, in its letter dated the 5th April, 1932 requested the Imperial Bank of Persia to send to it certain informa- tion in order that it might be able to a certain extent to probe into the accounts submitted by the bank’s experts in determining the dues payable by the bank. No reply has, however, been received on this subject^ It will be necessary, before the account of the said dues is definitely closed, to obtain a clear and detailed answer in this respect. 1 In the above-mentioned letter it was pointed out that, by virtue of the terms of the concession, the bank should have had its centre and registered office (“siege social”) in Tehran and that, therefore, the bank cannot exempt from Persian dues a part of its net profits which it pays to the British Gov ernment as income-tax because of its British nationality and its domicile in London. Further, the Revenue Department had stated that the bank had at least impliedly admitted that the dues payable to the Persian Government had priority, inasmuch as the said dues had been debited to the profit and loss account before British income-tax was taken into account. It was al s0 pointed out that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited), whose conces sion was similarly worded, had never raised any objection in this respect and had always paid the dues out of net profits before deducting British income-tax. (b) The Imperial Bank of Persia contested the above interpretation, and in the course of its memorandum dated the 8th June, 1932, advanced certain arguments which, briefly stated, are as follows: — Bank's Arguments} (1) As the bank had to work partly in Persia and partly abrciad, and as it had to be constituted in accordance with the laws of a foreign country, and seeing that disputes between the contracting parties had to be referred to arbitration, the concession must, therefore, be considered as an interna tional agreement and without reference to either Persian or English law, the concession must be interpreted and construed in accordance with the sur rounding circumstances and the intention of the contracting parties at the time. The Persian Government, by approving the bank’s statutes, has obviously taken full cognisance of the matter, and has also admitted that the bank must comply with the laws of the country where it is constituted and, particualrly, pay British income-tax so that it may continue its opera tions and make profits. Therefore, by “net profits” is meant profits re maining in Persia after paymei t of British financial and other duties.Refutation of above Arguments. The concession granted to the Imperial Bank of Persia has no interna tional agreement aspect whatsoever. It is merely an agreement concluded in Persia between the Persian Government and a foreign national laying down the terms under which the concessionnaire should work on Persian ter ritory (without forbidding him from extending and expanding his opera tions abroad). It is not, therefore, so important or effective if the Persian Government has not objected against the constitution of the bank the estab lishment of which it had sanctioned, as a British company. Moreover, an implied agreement on a question of appearance (form) cannot be considered as proof that the Government that waived some of the rights explicitlv assured (reserved) to itself in the concession, nor can it proove that the Government has permitted the deduction of a portion of the net profits due to it by virtue of the concession. The Imperial Bank of Persia must have its registered office (“siege social”—“Markaz-i-Asli”) and its centre of operations (“Markaz-i- Amaliyat”) in Persia. In justice and equity the bank should centralise in Persia ail its profits derived in Persia and abroad and pass same to the royalty account. Prom these should be deducted only such expenditure as are in reality necessary for the carrying out of the operations mentioned in the concession. British income-tax should on no condition be debited to this account, because it represents a part of the net profits derived in Persia and abroad which the concessionnaire company freely pays to the British Government by reason of its having selected British nationality. i . ■ ' . ' Bank's Arguments} (2) Over a great number of years the Persian Government has accepted that royalty should be calculated on net profits after deduction of British income-tax, and the High Commissioner who represented the Persian Gov ernment was no doubt aw are of the method of calculation of royalty, and never objected. This is proof that the Persian Government has heretofore accepted the bank’s interpretation regarding deduction of British income- tax from net profits.* 1 Refutation of above Arguments: The concession foresees the presence at the general meeting of share holders and meetings of the directors in Tehran of the Government’s special envoy. Apart from this the Imperial Bank of Persia did not in the past send detailed statements of accounts so as to ascertain that Brilish income was being deducted from net profits, and as no documents or positive proofs of any kind were presented, the Persian Government had been unable to agree to the amount of royalties it has received. Such payments have, on the contrary, been treated as part payments made on account and the Persian Government has not waived its rights. Therefore, the implied consent of the Persian Government which, it is alleged, existed does not apply. 9 n the contrary, the payment of £87,304 in 1928 indicates that the Imperial Bank of Persia itself impliedly agreed to the indefinite nature of the Persian Government annual royalties accounts. Moreoyer, by virtue of the conces sion, the Persian Government is entitled to 6 per cent, of the net profits of the bank. By “net profits” is meant profits less expenditure, and by expen diture is meant moneys spent in the course of deriving income. For this reason income-tax payable in England cannot be looked upon as expenditure, and for the same reason the Government s royalty must be paid befoie the deduction of the said tax, especially since the Imperial Bank of Persia, in spite of having had the sole right of issue of notes, has been exempt from all taxes, including income-tax whereas in England, where it has no such mono polistic concession, it pays income-tax. In the circumstances, how can it be said that the payment of British income-tax has precedence over the Persian Government’s 6 per cent, royalty which must compensate the Government s Exchequer loss for the non-collection of the usual taxes ?3. The second charge relates to a similar misappropriation in Septem ber 1931. This time the difference in exchange arose from the fact that the official rate of exchange was 90 krans to the pound, while the bazaar rate was 115 or 120. Sterling to the value of about £8,000 was, it is alleged, sold at the bazaar rate while the kran equivalent at the official rate was paid in to the bank; the difference being taken by Dr. Lindenblatt and Herr Vogel. 4. The third charge relates apparently to the illegal, or at any rate irre gular and wasteful, dismissal of an employee of the bank named Herr Fast at the beginning of 1931. Dr. Lindenblatt paid the dismissed employee £4,000 in compensation for his dismissal, which he explained on the inadequate ground that Herr East could not get on with Herr Vogel. The Public Prosecutor suggests that the real reason was that Herr Fast could not be persuaded to connive at the irregularities of the other two. 5. The fourth charge states that Dr. Lindenblatt deliberately falsified the balance sheet of the bank for the Persian year 1309 (March 1930 to March 1931). In order to give a more respectable appearance to the profit and loss account, the value of certain carpets, bought when the rate was 60 kr^ns to the pound and still unsold at the time of the account (prices at the.time being very unfavourable), was fraudulently entered at the rate of 90 krans to the pound, and the difference added to profits. Dr. Linden- blatt’s defence is that he was on leave at the relevant time, and that the accounts were prepared by Herr Vogel; but the Public Prosecutor alleges that the initials on the account can be proved to be those of the accused. 6. The last charge related to certain transactions in gold, made nomi nally in the name of the Minister of Court in October and November 1931. Certain amounts of sterling notes were purchased by the bank at the rate of 90 krans, and thereafter certain amounts of various gold currencies were purchased. The indictment states that these transactions are admitted by Dr. Lindenblatt not to be on behalf of the Minister of Court; the inference is that they were made for the private account of Dr. Lindenblatt, who is, therefore, guilty of speculation with the bank’s funds for his own advantage. 7. The indictment ends with supplementary accusations against six other members of the bank, who are termed Lindenblatt’s partners and ac complices. Vogel, accused of complicity as mentioned above, is unable to be prosecuted as he has committed suicide. Dust is said to have been an accomplice in counts four and five; Docker was implicated in count four; Feubel is said to have made false entries in the bank’s books; Stephan helped to draft the false balance sheet; and Scheiblich aided and abetted Stephan. It is remarkable, however, that the five last-named appear to have been exonerated subsequently by the Public Prosecutor, as not only did a notice appear in the Messager de Teheran of the 27th July saying that the indictment concerned Dr. Lindenblatt only, but a notice in certain Per sian papers also appeared to the effect that, in rectification of the statements previously published, Rust, Docker, Feubel, Stephan and Scheiblich were cited merely as witnesses and not as accomplices. 8. According to Herr Horst, the new German manager of the National Bank, they are all most harmless men. One of them has been acting as private secretary to the Minister of Finance, who was all at sea when tht man was accused and thus removed from Taghizadeh s side. 9. The accused manager is still in the Qasr-i-Qajar prison, and the date of his Dial has not yet been announced. He has bad the benefit of the advice of a German lawyer, who is at present in Germany, but will pre sumablv attend the trial. To judge from various articles and references to the affair in the Persian press (which is signally unfettered by any restrictions of comment on matters which are sub judice) T)y. Lindenblatt is considered to be a scoundrel and a swindler deserving of most exemplary punishment, to encourage the other foreigners in Persia. It is at any rate unlikelv that the court which eventually hears the case will do anything •/.BSBHKBSRHBSaHMi ' 16^ ! ; 1 other than pronounce sentence drafted before the trial. A member of this Legation staff was recently discussing recent Persian trials with a promi nent pleader in the Tehran courts, who told the following story; A Tehran court had two cases to consider on a certain morning. After the hearing of the first, the president of the court read out a judgment, which proved to be that of the second case! 10. Herr Horst, who is on very friendly terms with members of this Legation and with the chief manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, and seems to be a very different type of man from Dr. Lindenblatt, tells me that his work is made difficult by the shadow of Dr. Lindenblatt’s evil reputa tion. He himself thinks that Dr. Lindenblatt was a knave to some extent and a fool to a far greater degree, having been weak enough to involve himself in the nefarious schemes of Herr Vogel, who was a thorough-goim* blackguard. Herr Horst also told me in confidence that he found Hussein Quli Khan Nawab, one of his directors, a most unpleasant man to work under. Nawab had a mind like a cesspool and was as crooked as any man could be. On the other hand, Herr Horst has got over an initial prejudice against Hussein Khan Ala, whom he now likes better every day.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, London, to Foreign Office, London, No. 435, dated the 7th September 1933. I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a newspaper account of some trenchant remarks addressed by the Shah to the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Interior, at the recent opening of a military hospital, on the subject of the supply of hospitals and doctors. 2. The criticisms made by His Imperial Majesty are fully justified, but in view of the preponderating influence which he has himself exercised over every phase of Persian administration for so many years, it was perhaps a little unfair to address them to the unhappy Under-Secretary.. Enclosure to S. No. (127). Press Report of Criticisms by the Shah on Public Health Administration. When opening the new army hospital, His Imperial Majesty the Shah addressed the Under-Secretary of Interior to the following effect: — “This is a hospital established by the army for the army. What have you done for the public health? Is there a hospital established for that purpose? For many years I have heard that the Department of Public Health is establishing a hospital- W nere is it ? By now you could have organised a hospital of at least 300 beds if you could not manage the contemplated one of 1,000 beds. What is the Department of Public Health for? If for the public benefit, what steps have you taken. “You will perhaps plead that your funds are insufficient. This is a mere pretext. You should at least serve the public within the scope of your small budget. On what is it spent? “You think I am unaware of public health conditions. People 5U ^ for lack of drugs and doctors. I have seen sad statistics o deaths, and you spend the budget of the public health i Jehran for literary men and poets.166 “The country needs men and a healthy population, and the Public Health Department has tailed in its duty in this respect. “If this department continues as at present, I will cancel its budget and open the military hospitals to the public. “You must serve the people, look after their health, and put an end to negligence and procrastination.” i .j ( 128 ) Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Gulhek, to Foreign Office, London, No. 439, dated the 9th September 1933.

Meshed (No. 6) and Tabriz (No. 33). Enclo. to S. No. (128). MEMORANDUM. Japanese Trading Activities in Persia. Reports from His Majesty’s Consular Officers, more particularly in Southern Persia, indicate that Japanese trading activities in this country are on the increase. The absence of such reports from His Majesty's Consular Officers at Tabriz and Meshed would seem to show that in the extreme north and north-east the question has not yet become acute. His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman stated, in his annual commercial report for 1932-33, that Japanese cotton yarn, of which there had been practically no imports since 1927, had again appeared on the marker during the past year, and by the end of that period about 75 per cenL of all the cotton yarn consumed in the province was of Japanese manufac ture. Though admitted to be inferior in quality to Manchester or Indian yarn the Japanese product is considered to be quite as good for the pur pose for which it is chiefly required in that part of the country, i.e. y for the weaving of carpets, and it is usually about 10 per cent, cheaper. Imports of Japanese piece goods into Kerman increased by over 200 per cent during the year, whilst Soviet piece goods decreased by 50 per cent, United Kingdom by 40 per cent, and Indian by about 25 per cent His Majesty’s Consul is of the opinion that since even Soviet piece goods are unable to compete with the Japanese product, there is even less hope of British piece goods being able to hold their ground. In the annual trade report for Ahwaz for the same period, His Majesty's Consul stated that Japanese piece goods had for a time gained a considerable hold owing to their cheapness Hite Majesty s Vice- Consul at Mohammerah had, however, reported that a demand for bettei quality goods was increasing, and that Manchester goods were returning to favour, although imports were restricted owing to lack of peimits. 187(C) F&amp;PD167 Cheap articles of Japanese manufacture, particularly certain types of cotton and silk goods, attracted a ready sale, but owing to fluctuating prices merchants probably lost money by dealing in Japanese goods. His Majesty’s Consul at Bandar Abbas reported that it was believed locally that * in the coming year Japanese piece goods would oust the Russian product from the market, as Japanese goods were stated to be both cheaper and of better quality, and were therefore likely to gain favour in such an impoverished country. The importation of Manchester goods had practically ceased, but it could not be said that there was no demand for them as the piece goods imported through India were mostly Man chester products. His Majesty’s Consul gave the following figures of imports of cotton goods into Bandar Abbas during the year 1932-33: Cotton viece qoods : Rials. 3,051,238 2,464,933 2,070,304 337,670 Total . 7,924,145 Textile and yarns : Japan 12,176,566 India 8,658,000 U. S. S. R ' • • — • • 104,100 China ..••••••»• 39,400 U. K. ...» 16,600 Total . 20,994,666 u. s. o. n. Japan India U. K. In his commercial diary for July His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz reported that piece goods were being introduced into the market by the Japanese Commercial Representative at Mohammerah, and that the Russians were trying, at present unsuccessfully, by reduction of prices, to compete with them. His Majesty’s Consul further reported that a Mr. Kaniko, representative of a Japanese firm at Tehran, had recently visited Mohammerah in connection with the shipment to Japan by the Japanese vessel “Eeiun Maru” of a consignment of 12,500 bales of Persian cotton, and that Mr. Kaniko had appointed! a Persian merchant to represent his firm at that port. Two Japanese firms had recently established agencies at Mohammerah for the purchase of Persian cotton, and it was under stood that Japanese ships would call regularly at that port. A similar report has also reached me in Tehran to the effect that a representative o the Mitsubishi concern had recently gone south in connection with arrang ing for a regular service of Japanese boats to Basra. With the heay purchases of Persian cotton on Japanese account, and imports to Persia of Japanese textiles and cement, there would presumably be a certai amount of freight available for these vessels. It would appear from, the foregoing that a keen struggle is for the capture of the Persian market for cotton manufactures, and so far as can be seen at present the Japanese are gaining ground, ma ^ at the expense of the Russians, although a certain amount of British r will inevitably be lost in the process. Pending the conclusion of a sa ^ factory commercial agreement between Persia and the Soviet L nl0I \ • full strength of Soviet competition in this market is not yet being ex P a - n enced, and it is possible that they may later make a serious effort to ^ some of the lost ground. Meanwhile it is of interest to note that Jap*16S piece goods are reported to be less popular in the Tehran bazaar at present, as the repeated price reductions create suspicions that the Japa nese may adopt some of the less desirable tactics of the Eussian trading establishments about which complaints were recently made, and merchants are afraid of incurring losses, and are tending to withhold orders. It is said that during August Japanese piece goods were offered at 10 per cent, below recent prices, and that merchants refused to accept them.

Rumour has it that the work will be carried out under the supervision of A. P. O. C., engineers. A jetty is also to be built to enable ships to come along side. Apparently the idea of the Government is to be in a position to levy port dues as at present ships discharge in mid-stream which is Iraq water, a subject which has caused considerable controversy between the Govern ments of Persia and Iraq for some time past. It is also rumoured a rail way line to Ahwaz will be constructed the site for the station being behind the Bank Bungalows. The Port of Bunder Shapoor has apparently proved to be of little value and will apparently ultimately be scrapped.

Major Daly is of the opinion that as Russian piece goods had already undercut the British article, this new competition is likely to affect still further imports of cotton piece goods from British sources. 2. The Customs statistics accompanying the Meshed report show that imports via Zahedan during August included two hundred and twenty bales of Japanese cotton piece goods at rials two thousand and ten per bale and one hundred bales of Indian cotton piece goods at rials two thousand and one per bale, as well as one hundred and seventy five bales of Japanese ropes at rials one thousand five hundred and twenty five per bale. 3.

Enclosure in Tehran despatch No. 473 of the 7th October 1933. Persian Currency and Exchange. (Record of conversation with Mr. Wilkinson, Chief Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia). The exchange rate of the rial, which is a silver currency, is only affected to a comparatively minor degree by variations in the P r 'ce of silver. For instance, when the rate of exchange was about 115 rials to the £ si her point” was 95, and to-day, with the rate at about 76 rials to the £, silver point is about 90. [Silver point is the theoretical number of rials to the £ at anv edveu moment, bearing in mind the silver content of the rial and the price in London of silver per ounce. The formula for arriving at silver point is usually to divide 1666 by the price (in pence) of silver. To-day this would be (approximately) 90. To this price expenses would have to be added in the case of export of silver, and deducted in the case of import] 2 In practice the exchange rate of the rial is, given the absence of anv form of exchange control, solely affected by supply and demand. At present owing largely to the multiplicity of Governmental restrictions on foreien trade and also to the stagnation of the internal market, merchants are either unable or afraid to import goods, there are very tew buyers for foreign exchange, and the rial has appreciated to its present unduly high level7 This tendency is accentuated by the presence of large^ stocks ot accumulated exporters’ exchange, which the Government is trying to force on to importers at the high rates at which they were acquired. Certain classes of goods may only be imported after production of evidence that the importer has purchased dollars (present rate about 16 rials to the dollar) for rials at 28 28, or other foreign exchange at equivalent rates, these measures are not only bringing Persian foreign trade to a standstill out such exchange as is purchased at these artificial and arbitrary rates is usually immediately resold to the Banks and continues to act as a depressing factor on exchange rates. This process is explained in paragraph (r) o Mr. Wilkinson’s memorandum on currencv and exchange submitted to me Persian Mimstei of Finance, a copy of which, by the courtesy of the torrer 1 am able to attach. 3. The present high rate of the rial in terms of foreign exchange is a definite handicap to exporters of Persian produce, and does not bench importers, who are not only checked by quota and other import restnc i but are also injuriously affected by the obligation, referred to above, o P' chase foreign exchange at arbitrary rates in the case of certain groups commodities. Incidentally, Mr. Wilkinson informed me that these lat measures had only succeeded up to the present in relieving the ^o\ermnen of a very small proportion of its holdings of exporters’ exchange. 1 e , * level to which imports have fallen as a result of so many restrictions is o course reflected in a considerable falling-off in Customs revenue, by w the national finances are directly affected. 4. The Government have apparently again been trying with the freeing the importation of certain “luxury” goods {e.g., silk) at P re ,' prohibited. This would be a most ineffectual remedy, since there was ' , a limited demand in this impoverished country for goods of this na m-• What was really needed was an appreciable relaxation of import restric v j, ri} j so as to allow larger imports of necessities, which would lead to a re of business. The larger imports would increase the demand for o £ exchange, the rial would fall to a more normal level, and Persian ex P 0 JL u | c j the mercantile community in general, and the Persian Government ^ all benefit. Mr. Wilkinson agreed with my suggestion that the p j policy of the Persian Government was short-sighted, since they mea prosperity by Treasury receipts, whereas those receipts at the presen^ ^ &gt;vere only obtained by placing an excessive burden on the tax-paying172 I trading community. The results of this policy to date were an impoverish ment of those classes and of the country as a whole, and in the long j un Government receipts obtained in this way were bound to decline. 5. As will be seen from his memorandum, Mr. Wilkinson is of the opinion that a large measure of the present stagnation in the internal market is due to inadequate supply of currency in circulation. An undo y large proportion of the currency issued tended to be attracted away the main trading centres to the more prosperous areas, such as the oilfields and the regions where railway construction is actively proceeding. Ihe result was a scarcity of money in the trading centres, and unduly high rates were accordingly charged for credit and business was thereby definitely hampered. Mr. Wilkinson was therefore suggesting that the Persian Gov ernment should buy and import some £200,000 worth of bar silver. 1ms silver would then become additional backing for the currency, and it would be possible to issue additional currency to an equivalent amount, further amounts of fcav silver might be purchased from time to time if considered desirable and necessary to provide an adequate supply of currency. 6. With regard to the reported intention of the Persian Government to acquire in the near future about £2,000,000 worth of gold, Mr Mi 'inson said that this had nothing to do with the exchange question outlined above , The main object was to guard against further depreciation of the Gov- ernmenfs large foreign holdings of exchange These holdings did not enter into the question of the rate of exchange of the rial since as a rule . ey were never brought back to Persia except in the form of foreign snpp es and oauimnent (e.g., railway equipment or military supplies). Mr Wilkinson said 1 , hat he bad himself suggested to the Persian Government the advisa- bilitv of l heir possessing a gold reserve, as was done by most other coun tries and in the event of such a stock of gold being acquired it was probable that at any rate some of it would be brought to Persia and held here. 7 Mr Wilkinson also gave me a copy of a memorandum on the subieet of the effect of the exchange restrictions on the motor trade in P e ^ «b but asVhe subject is not directly relevant I am reporting upon d^parately. 2nd October 1933. .„ . ., t Since writing the above I have been informed by Hr.

These are main questions which are closely associated and should not be treated separately. enr i c hed itself considerably during 2 Persia is a eountry whi ^ which oug ht to have resulted, the last tew years, and yet the ; f th coun tr v has not occurred. i.e.. an increase in the metallic circulation oi Bazaais In fact, the tightness of money has 'ever ^so ^e, ^ accommodation for loans stands at rui 187(C) F&amp;PD3 \ few years ago, at one time, I. B. P. notes in circulation exceeded Tomans 20.000,000, and the demand for notes was so strong that the figure could' have been raised to Tomans 25/30,000,000, in spite of the fact that conditions in those days bore no resemblance to those existing to-day. On the other hand, the new circulation of rial notes stands Is: 20,000,000. 4. In mv opinion the following are the main reasons which account for this anomaly:— (a) A vita 1 change has taken place in the distribution of money, owing to large sums which are withdrawn from the big centres and find their way to Khuzistan and Mazanderan to provide for railway expenditure. Only a small percentage of this money is returned to circulation m the centres situated out side the above two provinces, with the result that the free movement of money is seriously hampered. (b) The natural and only remedy would be to put into action the means which are available^ for increasing the metallic circula tion namely, by the Government purchasing, say, £200,000 of bar silver, to be paid for with the supply of free foreign exchange, representing the excess exports of Persian produce, which is lying abroad and which is unproductive. (c) Apart from the fact that the current export trade of the country is creating a surplus of exchange abroad, there is, in addition, the surplus exporters’ exchange which, to a great extent, comes back on the market as free exchange. This is due to the impor ters being obliged to buy at the official rates in order to obtain , the respective import licences, but as the relative goods, in many cases, have already been paid for abroad, the importers are not in need of this exchange and they resell it. This has the effect of causing a continual fall in the rate which is hampering the export trade as the shortage of currency prevents the Banks from buying freely, with the result that borrowing in the Bazaar stands at a rate varying between 20 and 30 per cent. This has also the effect overeating great opportunities for money lenders and usurers. (d) The low rate of exchange, especially when (as at present) it is divorced from silver point, is detrimental to the trade of the country, and this applies to imports and exports alike, ihe main factor is, when the rate is below its true level, the exporter’s spending powder is reduced, less money is in circula tion., buyers of imported goods become scarce, and, consequent ly, the volume of trade diminished. (135) •' * ' i Despatch from H. M.’s Charge d’affaires Gulhek, tq Foreign Office, London, No. 467, dated the 6th October 1933. Abdul Hussein Kan Teymourtache died in Kasr Kajar prison on evening of October 3rd. His death has not been made public but 1 there can be no doubt of it. For the last few weeks he has been ailing, nevertheless the Shah thought fit to keep him in the strictest solitary con finement, forbidding the occasional visits of members of his family had formerly been allowed, and removing all furniture from his cell. Inn the man whose brilliant talents had placed him on a pinnacle of power la above all the Shah’s subjects, was left by his ungrateful master witno even a bed to die upon. &lt; 2. It is difficult still to know what was the real cause of the ShahJ bitter and unrelenting hatred against his former friend, the man w 7 ho done more than all other to create modern Persia. Perhaps one day th174 veil will be lifted and we shall know whether Teymountache played a double game with the Soviet Government or whether the Shah’s brutal cruelty to him was due to jealousy of his power and fear of usurpation at his death. 3. Rumours are of course spreading fast that Teymourtache was murdered. It is remarked tha£ the Shah left next morning for Tabriz, but this was probably pure coincidence. Possibly the former Minister of the Court was the viotim of slow poisoning, more probably of disease and distress of mind; in any case it has long been felt that he would never leave prison alive. If it is a fact, as ithe Shah’s doctor is said to have told a friend of his recently, that His Majesty is really suffering from cancer of the stomach, the murder theory thereby becomes the more probable. The Shah would not wish such a dangerous enemy to survive him. 4. The analogy between present day Persia and Tudor England has often occurred to me recently, and Dodtor Johnson’s lines on Cardinal Wolsey make a fitting epitaph: “To him the dhurch, the realm, their powers consign Thro’ him the rays of regal bounty shine. Still to new heights his restless wishes tow’r, Claim leads to claim, and pow’r advances pow’r; Till conquest unresisted ceas’d to please, And rights submitted, left him none to seize. At length his Sovereign frowns—the train of state Mark the keen glance, and watch the sign jto hate. Where’er he turns he meets a stranger’s eye, His suppliants scorn him, and his followers fly; At once is lost the pride of awful state, The golden canopy, the glitt’ring plate, The regal palace, the luxurious board, The liv’ried army, and the menial lord, Grief aids disease, remember'd folly stings, And his last sighs reproach the faith of Kings.’’ 5.

Mr. Hart found His Majesty-strikingly changed in appearance even since he last saw him a few months ago. He described the Shah as having lost about three stone in weight and his clothes as hanging very loosely upon him. The Shah received Mr. Hart with his hat off and the ^Minister was able to observe how very bald His Majesty had become. 3. I regard Mr. Hearts remarks as being of considerable interest as he was originally a journalist by profession and has acute powers of observation. He has left Persia convinced that the Shah has not long to live. 4. Meanwhile on the other side i£ must be admitted that the Shah’s energy seems outwardly to be as great as ever. He has just returned from a tour of Azerbaijan, Kurdistan, Kermanshah and Hamadan during which he hardly ever stayed longer than one night at one place. He has since been superintending the army manoeuvres outside Tehran and is expected to go to Mazanderan in November for £he Turcoman races and later to Khuzistan. 5.

You will see (that Mr. Simmonds does not consider that this route can ever compete seriously with the Ba'toun, or even /the Trebizond refutes. Its value in Persian eyes doubtless consists in the fact that it affords a bolt-hole in the event of complete intransigence on the part of the Soviet Government. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 72) and to His Majesty’s consul at Tabriz (No. 32). Enclosure to S. No. (140). Memorandum respecting the Rowanduz Route. ( Rowanduz Road. • I went over this road between the 17th and 20th August in company with Major Pybus, who is, I understand, preparing a detailed report. The condition and nature of this road have already been very fully des cribed by Mr. Stanhope Palmer, and there is not much that I can usefully add to his reports. At present the surface of the road is generally bad, to put it mildly, and in many stretches it consists of badly defined and unmetalled track, although in other cases a new road is under construction. 187^0) F&amp;PDIt is ouite possible for a private car or lorry to reach the Iraq frontier from Tabriz in one day at this time of the year, but in the winter season the road will obviously be impassable for months at a stretch. Very little traffic was observed on ithe road. Mr. 1 aimer told me that Haim Nathaniel’s lorries can now get no Ireiglrt from Baghdad to labriz, although freight is offered (to a certain extent in the reverse direction. The Russian route to Batoum is now open again atithe freights previously ruling, i.e.. the special increase of 300 per cent, imposed during the Persian Soviet dispute has been removed. Mr. Palmer said thait Persian merchants, probably acting again on instructions from their Government, are refraining as far as possible from using the Russian route at present, as they hope by this means to obtain still further reductions. Such reductions, in my opinion are unlikely, as the Persians are much more dependent on this route for quick and cheap transport tffian the Russians are in need of the addi tional freight The present rates for carpets from Tabriz to London via Batoum are according to Mr. Palmer, little more than half those quoted by Douri (for Haim Nathaniel) for transport to London via the Rowanduz route I,, Some reduction of rates on the Rowanduz route will no doubt become possible as the condition of the road improves, but nt is unlikely that they will ever seriously compete with (the Russian route, especially as the latter is an all-weather route. Even if Douri were able in the nest year or two to bring down his rates to approximately those now charged on the Russian route rates on the latter would no doubt be reduced, as the Soviet Govern ment would not lightly relinquish the hold they now have over the Persian transit trade. In my opinion, the Rowanduz route can never seriously compete with the Batoum route for the transport of Persian goods to European markets, and vice versa. At best it can only be an auxiliary route lor special types of high valued goods or in case of a recurrence of friction between the Persian Government and the Soviet. The Trebizond route would seem to offer possibilities of greater deve lopment as an alternative, once the road has been put into good order, as at least this route leads direct to a Black Sea port, whence goods could be sent by cheap sea freights to Europe. Ereight rates on this route would have to be brought down to the level of those charged on the Batoum route, as in normal times goods will naturally be sent by the cheapest routes. As in the case of tihe Rowanduz road, the Soviets would probably reduce tneir rates even below economic levels rather than allow any appreciable propor tion of £he transit trade from Northern Persia to slip out of their grasp. Development of one or both of these road routes could therefore at best be used as a lever to secure better terms from £he Russian railways, but it is not likely to supplant the latter. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires suggeted tha£ the use of the Rowanduz road by the Russian themselves for transport of their exports througn Northern Persia into Iraq and neighbouring countries might be a possibility. This would normally depend to a certain extent on the degree to 'wGicn tne Persians succeed in constructing the proposed road from Resbt to Tabriz^ It seems to me that the cost of transport across a considerable £tretcli^o Persian land territory, paid for in foreign currency, would considerably handicap Russian trade by this route. Sea freight to Basra would possiby be cheaper even in foreign bottoms, but most Russian exports to Basra are sent in Soviet ships, the majority of the expenses of which are met in paper roubles. Such expenses can scarcely be reckoned as adding consideraby to the cost of transport, particularly as the major part would be paid by one Soviet institution, the exporters, to another, the shipping lines.’78 (141) 1 / I {Received on 12th 'November 1933, with Political Secretary's letter No. £3, dated 26th October 1933.) •Despatch from H.

There is no doubt that His Majesty has twice been unwell during the last month and tha,t Dr. Alai, the son of the late Ala-es-Saltaneh, has had to be called in. 3. The rumours of serious illness may easily have arisen from the fact that the Shah’s intention to visit the Vaiiahd in Switzerland next year is now becoming widely known. People say that his real object in going to Switzerland is to consult a specialist. 4. His Majesty has appeared in public quite recently at the opening of a new military hospital [Cf. S. No. (127)], and ait a demonstration of aerial bombing, but I have not met anybody who has seen him recently at close quarters.

M.’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 581, DATED THE 16TH DECEMBER 1933. 4 As I have already reported by telegram [S. No. (145)], a number of Bakhtiari Khans have recently been arrested in Tehran. The Minister of War, Ja’far Quli Khan As’ad (Sardar As’ad) was apparently the first to be taken. On about the 28th or 29th November he was sent to Tehran under escort from Mazanderan, whither he had gone to be present at the Turcoman races in attendance on His Imperial Majesty and had distributed the prizes in His name. He has been in the Qasr-i-Qajar prison ever since, though no official announcement or explanation has been made, and the staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as the Chief of Police, profess complete ignorance of the reason for his detention. 2. Simultaneously with the news of this arrest rumours began to cir culate in Tehran that all the Bakhtiari Khans present in Tehran had also been arrested and from the evidence which I have been able to gather it appears that most, but not all, of them were arrested shortly after the arrest of the Minister of War. The aged Il-Khani, Lutf AH Khan (Amir Mufakham), his half-brother Ghulan Hussein Khan Bakhtiar (Sardar Mutashim). his cousin Haji Khusran Khan Ilkhan (Sardar Zafar), K.B.E., and I believe one or two minor Khans were spared, as w^ere the two Bakhtiari members of Parliament, Amir Hussein Khan Ilkhan (son of Sardar Zafar) and Muhammad Taghi Khan As’ad (Amir-i-Jang), younger brother of the Minister of War. But all the rest of the Bakhtiari Khans who were in Tehran were arrested on about the 30th November. The following is a list of their names, as far as I have been able to ascertain them, though I fancy that one or two of the minor Khans may have been omitted:— Muhammad Quli Khan As’ad (Sardar Bahadur), brother of the Minister of War, and commandant of the ‘Fateh’ cavalry regiment: educated for five years in London. Manuchir Khan As’ad (younger brother of the Minister of War). Yusuf Khan Ilkhan (Amir Mujahid), brother of Sardar Zafar. Muhammad Rahim Khan Ilkhan, son of Amir Mujahid. Salar Aria’. Haji Abbas Ali Khan (Shahab-us-Saltaneh). Sardar Iqbal. Teimur Khan, son of Sardar Iqbal. Habibullah Khan. Ismail Khan. Nusratullah Khan, son of Sardar Zafar. Muntazam ul Mulk. Parviz Khan. Twelve servants of the above Khans. Murteza Quli Khan, the Il-Begi, was as usual in the,Bakhtiari country at the time. 3. The constitutional immunity from arrest of the two Mejliss deputies did not last long. On the 10th December the Minister of the Interior, Mirza Mahmud Khan Jam (Mudir ul Mulk), informed the Mejliss that “certain persons have considered the security and development of the Pahlevi regime to be contrary to their personal interests, and have been guilty of conduct detrimental to the state, which has necessitated strong ^Government action Three deputies are accused of participation, v iz., Amir Hussein Khan Ilkhan, Muhammad Taghi .Khan As ad, and Ibrahim Khan Qawam. In order that the proper legal process be set in 187(C) F&amp;PD185 motion it is necessary that their immunity be withdrawn. The Govern ment therefore formulated the following motion : ‘‘The Mejliss approves that Ibrahim Khan Qawam, Muhammad Taghi Khan As’ad, and Amir Hussein Khan Ilkhan, be subject to criminal prosecution, and that the investigation and the circumstances be brought to the notice of the Mejliss on completion . This motion was passed unanimously. 4 Almost in the same breath that the Minister for Foreign Affairs „ a ve me this information, he told me that the Shah had been present at the Council of Ministers the previous day and that he had no idea of what the charges against anybody was. 5 The three persons mentioned had already been arrested at their houses early the same morning, and conveyed to the Qasr-i-Qajar prison. 6 The inevitable rumours have of course spread and multiplied, in the complete absence of any official statement beyond that of the Minister of the Interior One report states that the Minister of War is already dead. Tin truth is only known I believe to the General Staff and His Imperial Majesty himelf. * I summarise below the chief types of explanation which rumour offers. 7. Perhaps the wildest story is to the effect that As’ad, with the com- plicitv of Karakhan, was the prime mover in a plot to assassinate the Shah. T wo assassins are supposed to have been suborned to shoot His Majesty while Mazanderan. They were despatched from Tehran after the royal party in had left Subsequently, however, the news leaked out and the Shah was informed, and a telegram was sent from Tehran telling the two assassins that the game was off. This telegram was intercepted and sent to the Shah who produced it to Sardar As’ad who was overwhelmed at this proof of guilt. No story which circulates here fails to contain something akin to a germ of fact. And so I report that at about the time of the Shah’s depar ture for the races I received, through the Persian post, an anonymous letter saying that the Shah would be killed in a day or two; I sent the letter at once to the°head of the police who told the Oriental Secretary the next day that be knew all about the writer, who was under arrest. But it seems most unlikely that Sardar As’ad, who has enjoyed for so long a comfortable sinecure which has enabled him, with no trouble, to exeicise to the u is natural bent for gambling and general dissipation, should plot to remove the man on whom his comfort depended. It is pretty clear that if the Shan fell, Sardar As’ad woud fall too. As for the rest of the Bakhtiaris in Tehran, these unfortunate individuals have been in fact prisoners in ienran for a long time, and having nothing in particular to do except gamble, smoke opium, and wait for something fresh to happen, have all run into debt in the expensive life of the capital; it is therefore possible that tneir quite natural grievances should have found expression in talk which wnen repeated by third parties created an impression of sedition. . 8. Another explanation is that the Ilbegi, Murteza Quli Khan, who is apparently still in office in the Bakhtiari area, has conducted an intrigu- against the Minister of War, and made Pertain accusations against mm the Shah. . _ . , 9. Another story is that there has been an importation of arms into t Bakhtiari area, secretly arranged by the Khans in Tehran. As ad a Uakhtian area, secieuiy uy ^ ‘ r ; nt pd other Khans are supposed to have objected to the tribe being conscnp - savino- that the Bakhtiaris could supply twenty thousand irregulars w arms ^whenevef* the Government wanted, but that conscription was loreg to the susceptibilities of the tribesmen. . : , . 10. Another school of thought, or rather of rtmioilr, dttfibutes t is «udden proscription to the Continuance of the Shah’s policy of suppr3_ n all tribal influence bit by bit; the Qashqais have been repressed ami Oawam’s influence removed; the Lurs hatfe been transplanted and n , into railway navvies; now is the time for the Bakhtiafis to be brougm-—■—- ' - ■&gt;» 186 ill ii heel. Some two or three years ago Teymourtache told an Englishman here that “the turn of the Bakhtiari would come in due course”. 11. Even Basidu has not been forgotten and one story relates that the cause of all the trouble was the interception by the Governor of Isfahan of a letter from Sardar As’ad to the Il-Begi, in which the former stated that owing to the Basidu dispute, Angol-Persian relations were strained and the Bakhtiaris should be ready to take advantage of any difficulties into which the central government might fall as a result. There is indeed some reason to think that the misinterpretation of a harmless phrase in a letter sowed the seed of suspicion in the Shah’s mind, but whether Basidu was mentioned I have no means of telling. A sensational version of the Basidu story is that the dhow which the Mudir of Customs had been searching when arrested by the British naval guard contained arms for the Bakhtiari tribes* 12. Some say that the Shah, in anticipation of his visit to Europe, fears that intrigues will begin against him directly he leaves the country and that he is therefore eliminating one by one all the prominent person ages who might engineer or focus opposition to him. But in that case it appears odd that he should tackle As’ad now; there are many more serious candidates. ^ 13. As regards conscription, it seems fairly certain from many reports that the Bakhtiari tribesmen have not yet been subjected to this. The preliminary administrative operation of the issue of ‘sijill-i-ahwal’ (civil registration) papers has, I understand, been completed for the Haft Lang secton of the tribe, and for the remainder, the Chahar Lang, only small divisions remain unregistered; but the conscription authorities have not yet made much progress. Many of the Khans are known to be opposed not only to conscription but to another project on which the Shah sets great importance—the compulsory settlement of the tribesmen in villages instead of the usual annual migrations. It is conceivable that the Shah’s dramatic action is designed to show these recalcitrant elements that the Government’s policy must be obeyed. From some travellers I learn that a greater num ber of troops than usual is in the Bakhtiari area at present; so that compul sory conscription and settlement may soon begin. 14. I have also heard that a few weeks ago the Shah, who- has always been anxious to make the caravan track from Ahwaz to Isfahan, known as the “Lynch Road” or “Bakhtiari Road”, fit for motor traffic, suddenly ordered the Minister of Finance to find the money for putting this project into effect without delay, although the draft budget, in which no provision hnd been made for it, had just been completed—and balanced—with great difficulty. The tribes are alleged to have replied that “where a carriage can pass a cannon can too”. 15. The arrest of Qawam-ul-Mulk (Ibrahim Khan Qawam), who has throughout his career been a close friend of the British; has provoked com ment even among the Persians. It will be remembered that the Qawam went to Europe in 1929. at the time of the Qashqai rebellion; and that he then visited London. This visit has apparently given rise to a rumour now current in Tehran that the Qawam was induced to return to Persia on that occasion by some guarantee or promise given him by the British Govern ment. I have found no trace of any such engagement in the archives at this Legation and I presume that no such engagement exists. The only explanation of the Qawam’s arrest is that since he was (by the. Shah’s owh order) a friend of Sardar As’ad to the extent that they saw each other frequently, the Shah suspects him of being cognisant of the Bakhtiari treason, whatever it may be. 16. I enclose a copy of a report which I have received from His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz upon the local effect of the Bakhtiari arrests. 17. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 254), to the Honourable the Political Resi dent jn the Persian Gulf (No. 246) and to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz (No. 108). - in ill If 'K 1 . ikJl lllSSp l!187 Enclosure to S.

With reference to your telegram No. 35 of the 30th ultimo informing rne n th- arrest of the Minister of War and of other prominent Bakhtiari Khms in Tehran I have the honour to report that this news has apeared to cause little astonishment amongst officials here in Ahwaz. 2 I have discussed with the General Manager of the Anglo Persian Oil Pnrrmflnv at Abadan and with the Ahwaz Manager the possible effects of anTCtLr interference with the libertv of the Bakhtiari Khans. Both Mr Elkington and Mr. Clegg expressed the opinion that there is little likelihood of an immediate repercussion amongst the tribes unless there is any sensational development such as the arrest of the - am or of the II Begi, of whom one is understood to be at present in Tehran and the other m Isfa am ^ ^ there f ore) that I now hear from Hormuz Khan, the Bakhtiari Head Guard at the Oilfields, who is himself a nephew of Sardar As’ad that telegrams have been received from Amir Mufakham and from Murteza Quli Khan requesting him to bring to the notice of their local re presentatives at Malamir that they have both been confirmed ,n their res- pective functions as Il-Khani and Il-Begi, and that business is to be carried on as usual This information is being sent to Kadkhodas and responsible tribal chiefs throughout the Bakhtiari country, in order to re-assure them that they will continue to be governed by their own Khans. 4 It is understood that the Il-Khani and the Il-Begi are both leaving at once for Malamir, Bakhtiari winter headquarters. 5 The present policy of the Central Government seems to be a wise one in view of the congregation of tribes in the neighbourhood of the Od- flelds. It remains to be seen whether any changes will be made when the tribes return up country. (151) f • Despatch from H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 582, DATED THE 16TH DECEMBER 1933. I .have the honour to report, as being of possible interest, the.details of a case brought against Monsieur Ehlers, Austrian Consul m Tehran, y the Prosecutor General. I should explain that Monsieur Ehlers is no f -Consul de carriers and is engaged in business in Tehran. 2. In 1931 a small Austrian merchant, Fritz Monel, died in leaving many debts and a few assets. Acting on mstructions from the Austrian Federal Chancellery, in aceordan^ with their Intp^ &lt;tation of the Austro-Persian Accord Provisoire of 1928 which p ^ '^national treatment” in matters of ^inheritance, the Austrian Con. ,and eventually disposed of the estate of the deceased.

He was sued as . . ^ [onsie c ll f r „ ot leave Austrian Consul”. He was not,arrested but was told he u er y Tehran. He referred the matter to the Austrian Federal Chan J which in turn made representations to the Persian Minister tor 'Affairs to which no reply was returned. rhancel- 3. Eventually after some months delay the Austrian Federal lery informed the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs that t y ^ ^ refer the matter to the Hague. Thereupon Monsieur _ SIiayeste ^ Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs sent for Monsieur Ehlers a A ccor( i that he had acted wrongly and contrary to the provisions ot tProvisoire, which the Persian Government interpreted as meaning that in such matters the Persian Courts had jurisdiction but would apply Austrian Law and not that the Austrian Courts had jurisdiction. He suggested, however, that the only way to settle the matter was by “friendly arrange- jt* ment” and that Monsieur Ehlers should pay ten per cent, of the claims of the Persian creditors whereupon the Court would announce that the matter had been settled, 4. It appears that in pursuance of this suggestion and in order to free himself from further legal proceedings Monsieur Ehlers settled the claims of the Persian creditors by paying into Court a sum of seven thousand eight hundred Rials (of which he alleges five per cent, went to an official of the Ministry of Justice who arranged the matter). It is interesting here to note that the “claims” were neither examined nor proved in Court! He had in addition other leg-' 1 expenses bringing his total expenditure to some fifteen thousand Rials. He is endeavouring to recover this sum from the Austrian Federal Chancellery who, however, decline to pay unless they recover the amount from the Persian Government. 5. Despite all this, Monsieur Ehlers states that he has instructions from his Government to administer the estates of other Austrians dying in Persia and that he has in fact dealt with the-estates of four or five Austrians —mostly workmen employed on railway construction—who have died recently. 6. Most of the above information was given by Monsieur Ehlers to Mr. Brenan who called upon him on December 11th. He remarked that in the case of the estales of the workmen he had taken the precaution to refer to the Police and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs but that usually his communications had remain unanswered. He added that some three hundred and fifty Austrian workmen were employed on railway construc tion in this country and that he was constantly receiving complaints from them. He mentioned two forms of annoyance by the Police which were frequently reported. One was for the local police to accuse a man of being a “Soviet Agent” and order him to come to Tehran, indicating however that a “payment” of say fifty tomans might ease matters. The other was for a policeman by personl rudeness to invite a slap on the face whereupon the offender would be arrested for assault, tried by a local magistrate and ordered to leave the country. Again a hint would be given that the pro duction of a sum of cne hundred or one hundred and fifty tomans would lead to the suppression of the “dessier”. 7. I happened to mention Monsieur Ehlers’ difficulties to the Italian Charge d’Affaires who told me that he had had a similar case and received a stern reprimand from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. Monsieur Desandre was, however, able to make the retort courteous that as a matter of fact he had undertaken to dispose of the effects of a dying compatriot and that therefore the representation made to him was clearly based on ignorance of the true facts. 8.

Bolshevik Immigrants : (1st November). Since last year, certain Mohammedans and Armenians, settlers of Baku and other cities of Caucasia, exiled by the Bolsheviks on the pretext of their being Persian subjects and on account 187(C) F&amp;PDll—iUtiuggrr 189 of the dearth of food, are gradually arriving at Resht and Bander Pahlevi and other towns along the coast of the Caspian Sea. Most of these people who have arrived and are arriving at Resht are possessed of valuable articles some of which they have already sold in Resht. Among them, there wore two or three men who had with them some very precious brilliants which on their failure to sell them in Resht, they took to Tehran. But on their way between Resht and Kazyin they were robbed and so returned empty handed and in utter disappointment to Resht. Some discreet men and old inhabitants of Baku, etc., who have settled themselves in Resht since many years ago and who are engaged in business and trade assert that they have beheld amongst these immigrants certain men who took active part' amongst the Bolsheviks at the time when they were plundering in Resht and that they, apparently being exiled from Baku on the pretext of the dearth of provisions, are suspected to be other in nature than what they pretend to be. ‘ (Copies sent to India, No. 251, Baghdad, No. 105.

Apart from the effects of this expedition, Perso-Italian relations have been yet further embittered by the reported decision of the Italian Government to subject the Persian Minister there to similar treatment to that which is accorded to their representative, and indeed all diplomats, in Tehran. At the instigation no doubt of Count Viola, who is at the moment on leave, the Persian Minister’s parcels are detained for weeks in the customs, and every time that he seeks to leave the city he is obliged by the police to produce his diplomatic “carte d’identite.” It is amusing to conjecture what would happen if all the countries which have missions accredited to Persia adopted the same policy, but I fear that little good will result trom this retaliation on the party of the Italian Government, the Persian Government will almost certainly turn a deaf ear to the com plaints of their Minister, and 1 shall be astonished if conditions here sh )w any further improvement. It must, however, be admitted that, owing largely to Hie efforts cf Sir Keginald Hoare and the Turkish Ambassador, motor cars of members of the Diplomatic Corps are now submitted to a more cursory scrutiny than formerly at the gates of Tehran. 7.

Mr. Wilkinson however, is being requested to exhibit the letter to His Britannic Majesty s Minister before presenta- tion. Enclosure to S. No. (154). Reply by the Imperial Bank of Persia to the Memorandum by the Ministry of Finance accompanying its A ote to the Bank of June 18, 1933. The arguments set forth in the memorandum of the 18th June, 1933, have been carefully considered by the bank and those advising it. T blit and its advisers cannot accept those arguments as establishing the position claimed by the Government and they remain of the °P 1 ' 10 ' the method adopted by the bank in computing the sums payable to the Government is correct.191 2. The point at issue is clearly defined and the bank feel that no useful purpose would be served by a restatement oi their case. I he bank desire, However, to make one comment upon the arguments put forward by the Government and this comment applies to, and in the \ilw of the bank, vitiates all those arguments. ^ It appears to the bank that the Government fails to attach any weight * to the fact that the operations designed to lead to a profit, part of which was to be paid to the Government, were, with the assent of the Govern ment, to be conducted by a British concern; and that such concern neces sarily became subject to British taxes and bound to pay British taxes in respect of its operations before those entitled to participate in profits could receive their shares. That expenditure, indeed, must be made or provided for before divisible profits can be ascertained or divided. The principle of the concession is that whatever the divisible profits might be the Gov ernment should be guaranteed a minimum yeaily sum, subject to this, the Government follows the fortunes of the bank and shai es with the bank, in agreed proportions, the profits falling for distribution. The Government, in the view of the bank, is seeking to have a share in a hypothetical sum which does not exist for division. 3. So far, therefore, from the bank disputing an evident right of the Government, the bank takes the view that it is giving full faith and effect both to the letter and to the spirit of the concession.

I I have the honour to report that on my recent visit to Bir jand I learned the following : — After the usual morning Deception at the Vice-Consulate at Birjand on the occasion of His Majesty’s Birthday, the local Head of the Police sent individually for each of several Persian merchants who attended the reception. Each was questioned as to why he had attended and by whom he had been invited. The merchants stated that they had in the past always been invited on His Majesty’s Birthday and on New Years Day and had always attended as a matter of courtesy. No objection had ever been 187(C) F&amp;PD193 nreviously raised and they demanded to be informed whether there was any veto on their accepting such invitations in future. To this query no reply was given. u • The entertainment is, of course entirely inoffensive, being merely a social event at which light refreshments are offered and congratulations paid bv the visitors. In addition to a few of the leading traders the local sentry and the leading officials have always attended and were likewise nresent on this occasion. Our Vice-Consul knows each of the persons invited and particularly as regards traders, it is in the interests of British trade that he should be on good terms with them.

[E.-2443/1622/34.] Despatch from Foreign Office, London, to H. M.’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, No. 451-Confidential, dated the 6th November 1933. Sir John Simon to Mr. Mallet (Tehran). Under cover of his despatch No. 183 of the 22nd April [S. No. (71)], Sir Reginald Hoare forwarded two memoranda on the subject of the judicial safeguards referred to in the official notes exchanged at the time of the con clusion of the Anglo-Persian Tariff Autonomy Treaty of 1928. These memoranda constitute an admirable review of the facts relating to a very intricate question, and I request that you will express to Mr. Baggallay my appreciation of his work. 2. The matter has been carefully examined in this Department, and, in addition, Mr. G. T. Havard, who was, of course, intimately concerned, as oriental secretary at His Majesty’s Legation, in the prolonged oral dis cussions which led up to the final exchange of notes, has been semi-officially consulted. Mr. Havard states that throughout these discussions the atti tude adopted by the Persian Minister of Justice was that the communica tion in which the safeguards were to be embodied would merely constitute a statement of the existing position, under Persian law, on certain points which were of interest to Sir Robert Clive as being liable to affect British subjects in Persia. For a long time, it appears, the Persian Minister main tained the view that the safeguards should he recorded only in a semi-official letter to Sir Robert Clive, which would not be attached to the Tariff Auto nomy Treaty. Daver’s final consent to record them in an official exchange of notes was more than had been expected, and the negotiations would certainly have broken down if Sir Robert Clive had attempted to insist that the Persian Government’s communication should be cast in such a form as to render it an indisputably binding international engagement. In Mr. Havard’s opinion, the Persian Government would not for a moment admit that they were in any way bound by their note to maintain unaltered the Persian law and regulations on any point dealt with therein ; rather was the note intended by them as a simple statement of the position at the moment of its writing. 3. In so far as the theoretical attitude of the Persian Government is concerned, Mr. Havard’s independent recollections on the subiect are borne out by the memorandum enclosed in Sir Reginald Hoare’s despatch, and in particular by paragraph 31 of the memorandum. Further indirect evidence of the Persian Government’s attitude was, moreover, supplied by Teymourtache’s refusal, at a later stage, to agree to the inclusion of an article dealing with the safeguards in a bilateral instrument, namely, the proposed Anglo-Persian Commercial Treaty; while, converselv, the fact that an attempt was made bv His Majesty’s Government in 1929 to secure the inclusion of such an article in the treaty in question might perhaps be held to indicate that thev did not regard the mere exchange of notes as constituting in itself a binding international agreement. 4. Such indications of the respective attitudes of the two parties at the time when the notes were exchanged would, in the absence of any conclusive internal evidence of the binding character of the notes, be of considerable importance if it should ever be decided to refer the question to arbitration; and it must be admitted that the internal evidence is far from conclusive. The precise connexion between the exchange of notes and the Tariff Autonomy Treatv is impossible to establish bevond dispute, since, although the notes were signed on the same date as the treaty, there is no mention of the treaty in the notes, or of the notes in the treaty. The strongest195 argument which His Majesty’s Government could probably make for the internationally binding character of the safeguards would be based on the fact that they were signed on the same date as the 1 arm Autonomy Treaty, and on the contention that they were thus really part of the consideration for that treaty. But even this argument does not necessarily establish that the Persian Government was obliged to maintain them tor an indefinite period of time. 5 . Of importance in determining the value of the exchange of notes as a binding instrument is the question whether, without the assurances contained in the Persian note, His Majesty’s Government would have agreed to the abolition of the Capitulations, and whether, had they declined to agree the Capitulations could nevertheless have been abolished. There can be no doubt that, as a result of the passive attitude adopted by the French Government at that time, His Majesty’s Government were in practice powerless to prevent the abolition of the Capitulations, and that for this reason Sir Robert Clive was unable to make tin saft guards a condi tion of the consent of His Majesty’s Government to the abolition of the capitulatory regime. Sir Robert Clive s efforts were no doubt directed to securin 0, binding assurances from the Persian Government, but he vvas in the end obliged to centent himself with taking note of what on the Persian side is framed as merelv a reassuring statement ot the position under Persian law in regard to various points of concern to British subjects m Persia. The fact that Sir Robert Clive in his reply made a passing reference to the abolition of the Capitulations and expressed the confidence of His Majesty’s Government in the intention of the Persian Government to ensuie complete and adequate protection for British subjects does not affect the character of the Persian Government s note. In acknowledging Sir Robert Clive’s reply, the Persian Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs merely stated in general, though wide, terms that His Majesty’s^ Government could be assured of the protection which the new judicial regime in Persia would afford to British subjects. The Persian Government seem, in fact, to have been at pains to make it clear that they were merely making a unilateral statement of their intentions, and were not purporting to acquiesce in condi tions imposed by another party. 6 . From the considerations set forth above it must be concluded that it would probably be held that the so-called “safeguards” do not constitute an international engagement in the same that, in so far as they are embodied in provisions of Persian law, the Persian Government are not entitled to change them without the consent of the foreign Governments concerned. 7. It should not, however, be inferred from this that the safeguards are wholly without value or effect. His Majesty’s Government would, I am advised, be entitled to contend that, although the Persian Government may have the right to alter the provisions of their law in matters which concern the safeguards, they are bound, unless and until the law is thus altered, to observe its provisions rigidly, and consequently to apply the safeguards fully. Moreover, although it may be necessary to consider the safeguards in the light of a unilateral statement, on the part of the Persian Govern ment, of what their own intentions were, the assurances contained in the safeguards were given in writing, are embodied in diplomatic correspond ence and constitute formal documents of considerable importance. IN 0 Government which has furnished formal assurances of this character is justified in disregarding them at a later stage merely on the ground that they do not constitute a binding international engagement, and conse quently His Majesty’s Government could contend in principle that the Persian Government must continue to observe the safeguards unless they can show that the situation has radically changed since the assurances regarding them were given, or can otherwise show good cause for the non-observance of any particular provision. 8 . To sum up, then, it seems probable that if a dispute regarding th e safeguards were to be brought before a court, it would be legally impossi to show that the Persian Government were bound by their assurances, except in so far as they are bound by the provisions of their own law unle &gt;196 and until such law is changed. On the other hand, diplomatically and politically, an assurance is an assurance, even if given unilaterally, and cannot consistently with comity be broken except for demonstrably good cause. 9. Turning now to the question of the attitude which you should adopt towards this question in practice, I observe that the Persian Government do not, apparently, object to references on the part of foreign missions to the safeguards; in specific instances in the past they seem to have wished to show that their legislation and regulations do adequately cover the various points mentioned in the safeguards. How long they will continue to main tain this attitude it is, of course, impossible to predict, but, in view of the theoretical difficulties alluded to in the foregoing paragraphs, it will clearly be better to avoid, if possible, raising the question of the exact nature of the engagement which devolves on the Persian Government by virtue of their note incorporating the safeguards. 10. I request that you will be guided by the foregoing considerations in any correspondence or discussion relating to this question, and that if at some future date, the Persian Government should show an inclination either to disregard any specific provision of the safeguards, or to repudiate the safe guards, as a whole, you will refer the matter to me for further instructions. ( 160 ) (Received on 16th December 1933, with Political Secretary's letter No. J&gt;8, dated 30th November 1933.) Despatch from H. M.’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 495, dated the 21st October 1933. With reference to my despatch No. 394 of the 12th August [S. No. (126)], relative to the accusations brought by the Persian Government against Dr. Lindenblatt, the former German manager of the National Bank of Persia, I have the honour to report that the trial of Dr. Lindenblatt began on the 1st October, and was concluded after four or five hearings on the 14th October. The five other Germans mentioned in my previous despatch were after all brought to trial with Dr. Lindenblatt. 2. The judgment of the court acquitted all the accused except Dr. Lindenblatt himself. The latter was found not guilty on the third, fourth and fifth counts enumerated in my previous despatch. On the first and second counts he was found guilty, and was sentenced to eighteen months’ correctional imprisonment in respect of each count, and also ordered to restore to the National Bank two sums of 46,000 rials and £7,000 res pectively. 3. In dismissing the last three charges, the court appears to have taken the view, that, though the acts alleged to have taken place might have been proved, these acts did not amount to any offence under the articles of the various codes quoted by the prosecution, since the acts were not carried to their ultimate conclusion; for example though false items had been entered in the trial balance sheet, no distribution of fictitious profits to the share holders had actually occurred. In other cases, for example, the payment of £4,000 to Herr Rust, the court held that no criminal intent was proved. 4. The following is the part of the judgment dealing with the two charges on which convictions were secured : — “In respect of the £20,000 and the £9,600 transactions: In view of the statements of Feubel, which bore all the marks of truth fulness, and because the cheque No. 915357 for £5,000 and another cheque No. 915356 for £1,000 were found with him, and in view of his own avowal that the first cheque was credited to the account of his mother-in-law and the second197 was credited to his own account in the bank, and because of his further admission of having received the value of one of the six cheques issued in the case of the £9,600, its number being 645788 and its value £1,000, and the discovery of the subsequent number of that cheque in the Midland Bank in the name of Vogel, and in view of the irrelevance of his defence that he had no knowledge of the issue of the cheques in ques tion and that Vogel gave them to him in respect of a landed property transaction, in which case, far from there being any indications or trace conducing to the truth of this defence, other indications exist which leave no doubt as to the falseness of these statements, the guilt of Dr. Lindenblatt is definitely proved in respect of two items of the alleged charges. In view of their plurality, he is amenable to the maximum punishment stipulated by article 241 of the Criminal Code; but in view of the fact that he is an educated person who has shown capacity and qualification for the management and growth of the organisation of the National Bank, and because there is every likelihood that he committed the foregoing acts under the influence and instigation of others, and that he himself does not essentially possess a criminal and malevolent nature, he deserves mitigation of punishment; in consideration of the articles appended to the Code of Criminal Procedure, and according to article 241 of the Criminal Code, and in view of article 2 of the appended articles aforementioned, and in consideration of article 45 of the said law, he is condemned to eighteen months’ correctional imprisonment in respect of the first act, and in view of the same articles to eighteen months’ correctional imprisonment in respect of the second act (£9,600) In respect of the claim of the National Bank, as the facts above- mentioned have definitely been proved, he is condemned to pay to the National Bank 4,600 rials, and also £6,000 in respect of the £20,000, and a further £1,000 in respect of the £9,600. As to the other items in the charges which have no criminal aspect or which require further examination, he (Lindenblatt or the Public Prosecutor : Translator) can refer to the compe tent courts.” 5. Both Dr. Lindenblatt and the Public Prosecutor are said to have appealed against the judgment.

My letter of the 3rd instant. Here is the memorandum by Trott upon the Persian renderings of the word “Imperial” which I mentioned in the postscript. Although the translations of our notes are unofficial, and the titles used therein in consequence of relative unimportance, these same titles must often be used in circumstances where their use cannot by any stretch of imagination be qualified as unofficial. Communications addressed by Consuls to local authorities are perhaps the most obvious example. It is therefore necessary to come to a definite decision upon the requests made, boldly enough, in the Persian circular. My own view subject to those of any learned historians at Home or in India is that we should give the Persians their title “Shahinshahi” qualifying it always by “Iran”. The use of the terms “Imperial” etc., in English present no difficulty. A copy of this letter and its enclosure are being sent to the Foreign Department of the Government of India. Enel, to S. No. (162). MEMORANDUM. The Persian Government’s circular note No. 29624 of the 2nd November professed to lay down the correct way of alluding to the “Imperial State and Government” (mamlikat va doulat-i-shdhinshdhi). The former (i.e., the State) is to be called “mamlikat-i-shahinshahf—i-fran” (“the Imperial Persian State”) and the latter (the Government) is to be called “doulat-i- shahinshahf-i-fran” (“the Imperial Persian Government”). The main point appears to be the insistence on the employment of the word “shahinshahi” which is the adjectival form of the noun “shahinshah” (“King of Kings”). This word, or its equivalent in older forms of Persian, bas a very respectable antiquity, having been used at least as far back as Darius the Great, as a corresponding expression is to be found on the Bisitun inscription of about 550 B. C. The Sovereigns of Persia in recent times, of whatever dynasty, have applied the name to their high station. The word occurs on the coins of the present Shah. The novelty of the present Note lies in the use of the word in qualifica tion of the “State” and the ^Government” of Persia. It is arguable that the Persians are entitled to decide for themselves what their State and their Government should be called. But it is relevant to examine the new proposals in the light of three considerations :—- (1) Our previous practice. (2) The Persians’ previous practice, and ; (3) The real significance of the change. (1) Our 'previous practice .—“The Imperial Persian State' is a phrase which we have never used. It is doubtful whether it can be used in English with any pretensions to style. We either say “Persia” or occasionally in every formal documents “Persian Empire” (Empire de Perse).The “Imperial Persian Government” is a phrase that we do use occa sionally, though we more often say “The Persian Government” or if we are trying to be especially polite “The Imperial Government”. It is doubtful whether “Imperial” and “Persian” can be used together in strict logic as they suggest that there might be some other Persian Government than the Imperial one. We have never used in our translations the word “shahinshahi” in referring to the Persian Government or the Persian State. “Imperial Government” has hitherto been translated by “ JyJ ” “doulat-i- ’aliyyeh-i-iran”, (“the elevated Persian Government”). This practice has prevailed for many years. The word “’aliyyeh”, meaning “elevated” has hitherto been regarded as the proper appelation of the Persian Government, and in conversation this usage still persists. The word “’alfyyeh” in fact shows that one is talking about the Persian Government and no other Gov ernment. Similar titles distinguished the British, Russian, and Turkish Governments. The British Government was called “doulat-i- fakhimeh” translatable perhaps as “the Government great in rank”; the Russian was called “ ” “doulat-i-bahiyyeh” (“the high-priced Government”) ; and the Turkish “doulat-i-sanniyyeh” (‘fthe Shining Government”). These names are still in use in conversation. As for the translation of the words “Persian Empire”, we have not recently had to translate it. The titles in all the old deeds, and on some of the stamps of Persia, is “ ”, “mamalik-i-mahruseh-i-iran” which may be translated “the heaven-protected States of Persia”. As for the Shah’s title, here again we do not use the word “shahinshah”, or padishah” either, in our translations. We do not distinguish between “His Majesty’ the Shah” and “His Imperial Majesty”; we translate them both by ilr| ”, “a’la-hazrat-aqdas-i-humayum” which can be translated “The Royal, Most High, and Most Saintly Presence”. For short the word “aqdas” is sometimes left out by it is more polite to put it in; we always put it in. (2) The Persians' previous practice .—In certain recent documents the word “shahinshahi” has been used. On the coins now being issued from the Mint, the Shah is called “Riza Shah Pahlevi Shahinshah-i-iran”; similarly in the full powers which he signs (e.g., for the Telegraphs Agree ment) and Royal Commissions. The use of the word “iran M somewhat limits the arrogance of the title. In ordinary documents the Persians, in referring to their Shah, use the same phrase as we do, though they are inclined to add (even in tele grams!) the Arabic invocation “ “arwahuna-fidah” meaning may our souls be his sacrifice”. Of course we do not say this. 1 he Persians do not usually employ the word “Shah”; they call our King “Padishah”. The address used by the Persians on their notes to this Legation is now: | The Legation of His Majesty the King (padishah) of England at Tehran”. Inglisi is the usual rendering of “British”. There is however a Persian word for Britain” and “British”; I have sometimes seen the words (which are just transliterations, as near as the Persians can get) “Brit&amp;nfa-i-kabi'r”, an ^ “ ” * Britam” used as the equivalent of “Great Britain” and “British”. &lt;( The significance of the change .—The insistence on the word shahinshahi is probably an attempt to magnify the importance of the Persian Government through the re-adoption of an ancient appellation. The Persian Government presumably resent the use of the word “’aliyyeh” as not being sufficiently respectful. It should be noted incidentally that when the Persians refer to our Empire they do not use the word “Shahinshahi”. They use a sort of trans literation of our word “Imperial”, viz., “ ty*) ”, “imperaturi”, Theirimni 200 phrase for the British Empire is “ ^ “ mus t a &gt; marat-i-doulat-i-imperatun'-i-inglis” meaning literally, “the colonies of Government of England”. It is therefore arguable that ^naninsnahi is not quite the same as our word “Imperial”. kecostruetiye, or to pull their legs, we might ask them which Kings is Reza King over. This we mi % ght cal] the Quick Modest, If t0 i re W with the Retort Courteous, let us attempt to give- -]vr ’ t ? r' Ue e British Commonwealth of Nations and His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom (which would take some rans a ing), adding that if they don t like all this verbiage we are pre pared to let them call us simply “the British Government” as hitherto, and we will call them just the “elevated Persian Government” as hitherto;- thirdly it we select the Reproof Valient let us say that the word is nonsense and the “Imperial Persian State” an impossible phrase- lastly if we want to administer the “Countercheck Quarrelsome” let us reply that we know how to translate just as well as they do. Or, alternatively, let us say nothing and acquiesce.

I now have to report that the eighth term of the Majlis, which was initiated by the Shah on the 16th December 1930, came to an end on the 15th January 1933. 2. The last session took place at 11-15 p.m. on the night of the 14th January. The President, His Highness Mirza Hussein Khan Diidgar, opened the proceed ings with a speech in which he said that the eighth Majlis had been able to fulfil conscientiously and quietly its functions owing entirely to the wisdom and firm ness of His Imperial Majesty the Shah. The speaker recalled that in former legis latures, in spite of the excellent intentions of the deputies, the lack of centralisa tion and of security in the country had rendered all their good intentions useless. Now, however, all was different. 3. Mirza Khalil Khan Fahimi then eulogised the President for his self- denial, his calm temper, and his impartiality, and went on to allude to the happ}' results obtained and reforms realised under the aegis of His Majesty. 4. Another speaker (Sheikh ul Mulk Owrang) spoke in the same strain, and observed that the people of Persia ought to thank God for giving them such a sovereign as Riza Shah Pahlavi. He continued by remarking that the Majlis and the Government had worked together in perfect agreement, so that it was impossible to separate the two or to draw distinctions between them ; just as a comparison bet ween the eye and the hand of the body was out of place. 4. The Prime Minister, His Highness Mehdi Quli Khan Hidayat, wound up the debate. He developed the idea of the unity of hand and eye, saying that each was useless without the other. What was the spirit which was guiding them today in Persia 1 Unquestionably they owed everything to Riza Shah Pahlavi. The} must work energetically and attentively ; but even then they would be far from realising all the beneficiont nrojects which that august sovereign had conceheu for the benefit of Persia. Whatever they had done hitherto was nbt enough. Hie Shah’s desire lor progress required constant and unremitting effort. It was a matter for great satisfaction that all the laws which had been voted had been scrupulously put into force ; though the same could not have been said for pre- vious legislatures. His Highness in conclusion expressed the hope that the e}0 and hand ’, working in complete harmony, would be able to fulfil with success3 the duties which they had assumed in the service of the spirit which animated them. 5. In spite of the hopes expressed in August, the new Majlis has not yet met. A good many of the so-called elections have been held in the provinces, and it is believed that a sufficient number of deputies (amounting to over seventy) have already been elected to enable the Majlis to begin its ninth term. I shall not fail to report its formal opening. 6. Rumours of cabinet reconstruction have been rife ever since the beginning of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company dispute. Mirza Hassan Khan Pirnia (Mushir ud Douleh), his brother Mirza Hussein Khan Pirnia (Mu’tamin ul Mulk), and Mirza Hassan Khan Vossuq (Vossuq ud Douleh) have all been named by the prophets as future Prime Ministers. It seems probable that no such change will be made till the state of the oil dispute becomes clearer than it is at present. Per haps also the scandals alleged against Mirza Abdul Hussein Khan Diba, the former Treasurer of the Royal Household, who is accused of selling places in the Majlis for two thousand Tomans and then not securing the payer’s election, may have delayed the opening of the new Majlis. One Amir Mansur, son of Mirza Fathullah Khan Akbar (Sipahdar-i-A’zam), a disappointed candidate, is, I am credibly informed from many sources, suing Diba for the return of two thousand Tomans lost by him in this disappointing investment. 7. Of one thing .1 am quite certain ; namely, that the Shah keeps cabinet, • Majlis and Government completely under his personal control. All his ministers are thoroughly afraid of their royal master, whose sourness of temper is increas ing. The Ministry of Roads and Communications has just received a new head— the announcement of the new Minister’s transfer (Mirza Rajab Ali Khan Mansur, C.B.E., was until yesterday Minister of the Interior) did not even mention what had happened to General Abdul Majid Mirza Firuz, the previous Minister, whc% in turn had suddenly succeeded Mirza Riza Khan Afshar last July. I do not know whether current gossip speaks truly when it says, firstly, that Riza Shah was heard to express his determination to run his Government himself when Teymourtache was dismissed, or secondly, that the Shah now regularly attends in person all meetings of the Council of Ministers. But I am sure that the new Majlis will meet if, and when, Riza Shah so desires. 8. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 14). ( 6 ) Despaich feo^i H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 60, DATED THE IOtH FEBRUARY 1933. I have the honour to inform you that more recent information throws a good deal of doubt on the most satisfactory nature of the interview which took place between the Persian and Soviet delegates on January 3rd, to discuss the situation arising out of the boycott and picketing of the Soviet trading and transport orga nizations in Gilan, as reported in paragraph 7 of my despatch No. 11 of January 12th last [Serial No. (76) in F. No. 1-N.|32]. While the boycott remains in force —it has in fact been extended to all or most other provinces—the picketing to which the Soviets, quite understandably, objected most strongly is a thing of the past. The Shah’s rice has also been shipped to Baku, which has inspired an optimism in the individual rice grower and merchant which may well prove un warranted. But it seems very unlikely that any intimation has been given to the Persian Government of the Soviet Government’s readiness to contract for the purchase of stipulated quantities of staple Persian products ahead._ The Per sian authorities ; attitude appears to be one of nervous apprehension in re gard to the outcome of their eventual negotiations. 2. Neither do the Persian Government give signs of having abandoned their idea of entrusting all commercial dealings with the Soviets to one central organi sation. They should rather be suspected, with the approaching return of the Soviet Ambassador in mind, of having fostered the agitation which Persian mer chants have been conducting in favour of the policy of centralizing trade with Soviet Russia in an increasing volume of resolutions, open letters Jo the Prime Minister and complaints voiced in the press of the Government’s inaction. 3. The attached account of a statement which is alleged to have been made by the Prime Minister to a local carpet dealer with whom he appears to be on termsof friendly indiscretion, and communicated by the latter to the Commercial Sec retary, is interesting. It begins by giving in a succinct form the well-known Per sian objection, or one of the main objections, to direct transactions between the Soviet trading organizations and individual Persians or Persian firms; the fear of propaganda, and goes on to deal with the danger ot granting the Soviets credits against their purchases of Persian products (all the more that they will only sell against cash) in view of the possible collapse of the bolshevik regime. 4. It is interesting to note that, according to this document, the official Per sian view is that the {Soviets—whatever their sins may be—can be relied upon to meet their bills. Various reports from His Majesty’s Consular Officers in the provinces which I hope to transmit to you in the near future will be found, I think, to bear out the views expressed in my despatch No. 507 of December 2nd last on this subject. 5. Monsieur Petrovaki, the Soviet Ambassador, has already arrived at Resht. I understand that he will not stay long, having already been appointed to Vienna. He is believed to have been given full powers to negotiate a commercial modus vivcndi, to take the form of amendments to the Commercial Treaty of October, 3931, presumably, but the Soviet Government are said to harbour little hope of its realisation in view of the “ unreasonable demands ” of the Persian Govern ment and to propose to leave Monsieur Zuckermann as Charge d’Affaires as long as the conflict lasts. In the meantime, one expects the Soviet Government to resort to their usual method of bringing the Persian Government to their senses, which consists in refraining from buying Persian produce. 6. The Commercial Secretary learns from an independent source, as a corol lary to the above, that the Shah has instructed the Director of the Department of Commerce to concentrate on the need to find alternate markets for Persian exports to the Russian, whether through an agreement with Dr. Friedlieb (which, &lt;€ie gathers, is to exclude import monopolies) or any other means. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade [No. O.T (B.)-29], to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 20), and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 11). Enclosure to Serial No. (6). Statement made by the Prime Minister to Mr. Buasi, privately, of 21st January 1933 on the subject of Russo-Persian commercial relations. Nous voulons, enpecher les relations directes, echats ou ventes, entre les Etablissements des Soviets et les Persans pour deux raisons de base :— 1) Eviter que, par des contacts directs, les Soviets, en favorisant tel ou tel de leurs clients, fassent de la propagande sous une forme detournee ; eviter que direc- tement ou indirectement ils fassent des veates “ de favour ” a des personnes qui ne sont pas dans le commerce mais qui, en retour de ces favours, favonsent 1’action sovietique ou agissent comme des agents d’information. Ce qui precede e’applique tant aux ventes des Soviets qu’a leurs echats en Perse ; ainsi, elors que les paysans re^eivent 3 ou 4 rials pour le riz qu’ile vendent, les Soviets I’achetent finalement a environ 8 rials. (Note : The Prime Minister obviously ignores the normal functions of the middleman). 2) Le Torgpred vend ses articles ou produits au comptant, et avant de livrer prend des avances lors de I’establissement de contrats de vente. Par contre le Torgpred achete une partie tres importante de ses envois en Russia ou a 1 etranger au noyen de traites a plusieurs mois de date. II est entendu que les traites de Torgpred sont regulierement payees. Le question a’est pas la. En prenent des avances puis en vendant au comptant, encaissant la ^ ue sur livraison apres deduction des avances deja encaissees, il a’ensuit que le Torg pred, entre les avances sur contrats et le montant global des traites qu il eI ^ ie ^? n representation de ses achats, doit d’une fagon permanents aux negociante etablis en Perse, dons a la Perse, une somme globale allant de liet 12 a meme 14 et millions de tomans. Or le regime des Soviets ne presentent pas a notre sens des garanties de stabilite telles qu’eiles puissent nous encourager a acceptor indefiniment quo 68etablissements de ru295 en Perse solent constanment debiteurs de sommes aussi elevees a la Perse, car en cas de changement de regime en Eussie il pourrait en reculter en nouvel ebfondrement de I’economie persons, venant apres celui qui fut enregistre lors de la debacle de la monnaie russe avant et pendant ja guerre dont la Perse fut inondee pendant toute la duree de la guerre, debacle qui occasionna- des pertes extremement severes aux Persans. Nous voulons eviter le retour d’un precedent aussi doulcureux ; de meme que pendant la guerre les enoraes livraisons de produits persans Pa la Russie furent notamment reblees par le noyen de papier monsaie qui finalement perdit tent sa valeur, de meme partie tres importante des produits persans sont livres a la Eussie contre des traites qui en cas de changement de regime peuvent etre reduites k rien. II est dene nature! que le Gouvernement Persan cherche a se premunir, dans I’interet de 1’economic persane, contre une telle eventualite. (7) Despatch from the Commercial Secretary, H.

The simple and sensible solution has been taken of adopting the metric system, the metre to be used for measurements and the kilogram for weights. 3. The previous law, which was never effective, of 10th Khurdad Mah 1304 (1st June 1925), is cancelled by the new, which is to come into force not less than two months after a sufficient number of weights and measures for the whole country have been provided by the Department of Commerce, and due notifica tion having been given to the public. 4. As ihe method of preparing the weights and measures, their introduction and other circumstances relating to the enforcement of the law, depend on special regulations still to be sanctioned by the Council of Ministers, it will no doubt he some time before the law will actually become effective. 5.

M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, LondoSt, No. 43, dated the 11th February 1933. I have the honour to inform you that on or about August 28th last, a railway collision occurred near Ahwaz, as the result of which the engine-driver, by name Moses Joseph Rohekar, an Indian British subject, was taken into custody. De tails of this accident, and of Moses Joseph’s arrest, are contained in the despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz of which I enclose a copy [Enclosure I to Serial No. (8)]. It will be seen that there were no casualties. 2. Moses Joseph first brought his case to the notice of His Majesty’s Consul at Tehran, through his wife, on November 8th, and after telegraphic enquiries had been made as to his identity and nationality of His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz, I sent a note to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs asking him to make enquiries and ascertain under what regulation the prisoner had been de tained for so long without trial. I added that I was informed that he had been prevented from communicating with His Majesty’s Legation and asked that he should be allowed to do so in future. 3.1 sent reminders on December 71 h and December 21st, and on January 21st wrote again embodying some of the additional information contained in the Ahwaz despatch, which I had by then received. An intermediate reply, stating that the case had been referred to the competent authorities, arrived on January 29th. On February 2nd, the head Munshi, on my instructions, saw the Public Prosecu tor of Tehran, and the information which he obtained was embodied in a further note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, of which I enclose a copy [Enclosure It to Serial No. (8)]. 1 may add that in addition to the written correspondence I have more recently spoken to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and that oral reminders have been given to other members of the Ministry. 4. You will see from this correspondence that Moses Joseph has been de tained in custody for over five months without a regular charge being even for mulated, and that Ibis delay has been chiefly caused by his having been brought quite unnecessarily and improperly to Tehran. The present position is that the police are waiting for the Amnieh {o send an escort to take him back to Khuzistan. 5. Being sent back to Khuzistan will not in itself help him, and I propose to press the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to arrange his release privately on *' ground that he has already been sufficiently punished for any act of negligence t a lie may have commiUed. There is just a possibility that if an open dispute ca^ lie avoided the man might be able to secure re-employment on the ral '^ a ; (although I have heard rumours to the effect that prior to the accident he reputation as a heavy drinker) and if so it is naturally in his interest that sue ^ dispute should be avoided. If, however, I am unsuccessful in this, I Pus ^ I shall have your support should it become necessary to resort to pubheu} means of bringing pressure to bear upon the Persian Government and obiai - compensation for unlawful detention. (&gt;. In the meanwhile His Majesty’s Consul has been able to arraugu Moses Joseph’s wife to visit him regularly and has himself seen him th° detention quarters vdiere he is kept. He has apparently no complaints o ^ as to his actual treatment. His food is adequate and he may suppleimen ^ of his own pocket. His quarters are clean and furnished with a bed, mu7 allowed a bath twice a week. AMien he was ill wdth rheumatism, he w r as kept for about two mouths in hospital, where he w’as w^ell looked after. 7. Arrangements are being made for his release on bail at the time that the examining magistrate decided that he should be returned to Khuzistan. The arrangements w r ere thereupon dropped. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Gov ernment of India (No. 19), and to His Majesty’s Consul at AJiwaz (No. 11). Enclosure I to Serial No. (8). Despatch from H. B. M.’s Consul, for Khuzistan, Ahwaz, to H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, No. 48, dated the 21st December 1932. With reference to Mr. Monypenny’s telegram No. 23 of November 12, last, regarding Moses Joseph Rohekar, a British Indian subject by birth, I have the honour to report as follows. This man has been employed by the Southern Per sian Railway Administration as an Engine Driver since 1931. The Assistant Manager informs me that another Indian driver, named John, w T as involved in a railway accident early in August last when sixteen trucks w r ere derailed and badly damaged owing to the state of the track. The driver w T as not held respon sible for the damage. On or about August 28, Moses Joseph v 7 as responsible for a collision near to Shush which apparently occurred through negligence. According to the report sent to Alnvaz the driver w T as asleep and handed over the control of the engine to a friend, who ran past the signal and collided with another train, damaging the engine but causing no casualties. Joseph Moses himself awoke in time and jumped clear, escaping injury. A further report states that a bottle of araq wms found on the engine. The driver denied that he had handed over control of the engine or that he had been drinking and stated that the brakes weie defective. Mr. Wilson, the Assistant Manager, states that he proceeded to the scene of the accident at the time and found that the air brakes, throttle, and reverse gear w 7 ere all in working order. Mr. Wilson accordingly gave instructions for the driver to be put under arrest, but no charge w 7 as then or has subsequently been made against him. As it was not known what charge to make. The matter was referred to the local Court which wms unable to advise the Railway Administration as to what charge to prefer. The Police report on the case which was forwarded to Tehran stated that the engine was badly damaged and would be a total loss. I am informed that the driver was sent there in custody on instructions from the present Minister of Communications. The reason for this is said to be that information about the first accident had been supplied privately to His Majesty the Shah, who dis covered that no official report on the matter was sent to Tehran. It was accord ingly decided that the present case should be dealt with in Tehran to avoid further explanations to His Majesty, who has also been informed about the second accident. In view 7 of the fact that no criminal charge has been made against Moses Joseph Rohekar, I am of the opinion that steps should be taken to secure his liberation. In this event it may be necessary to repatriate him. Mr. Wilson himself suggests that if no official intervention is decided on the man might employ a lawver, if necessary, to secure an oidei from the Couit for his release, as it is not tlie intention of the Railway Administration to take any action against him. The damaged engine has since been repaired and is at pre sent in commission. Enclosure II to Serial No. (8). Note from H. M/s Minister, Tehran, to Minister for Foreign Affairs, No. oO, DATED THE 6tH FEBRUARY 1933. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Highness’ note No. 38585 of the 29th January last (9th Bahman 1311) on the subject ot the Indian British subject Moses Joseph. 2. I gather from Your Highness’ note that since the first representations made by me in my note No. 571 of 23rd November 1932 (2nd Aban 1311) on the subject of this man’s imprisonment Your Highness has not been able -O piocuie an explanation of the circumstances surrounding the case.8 3. I am, however, now able to place the following information at Your Highness ’ disposal. 4. As the result of a railway accident which occurred in Khuzistan on or about’the 28th August 1932 (6th Shahrivar 1311) Moses Joseph was arrested at the instigation of the railway administration. The police carried out a preli minary enquiry in the usual way and in due course handed him over to the Pub lic Prosecutor’s Department of Khuzistan, where the ordinary examination took place. At this point, it appears, the Acting Minister of Communications, who was on a tour of inspection in Khuzistan at the time, gave instructions for Moses Joseph to be sent to Tehran. These instructions were carried out. 5. Since then the man has been destined for five months in a police prison in Tehran while a prolonged exchange of correspondence has taken place between the Police of Tehran and Khuzistan with a view to completing the preparation of a charge against him. 6. Eventually the dossier of the case was submitted to the Examining Magistrate of Section 7 of the Public Prosecutor’s Department of the Criminal Court of Tehran. 7. On the 10th Dev Mah last (31st December 1932) the Examining Magistrate returned the dossier to the police with a decision to the effect that the case should never have been referred to the Tehran court but should have been dealt with by the Public Prosecutor’s Court in Khuzistan, wdiich had full competence to deal with the case on the spot. 8. It would appear therefore that {a) his transfer to Tehran was ordered by the Public Prosecutor of Khuzistan at the behest of the Ministry of Communi cations acting ultra vires and (h) that his continued incarceration in a police prison in Tehran persisted for five months without trial and without in fact a formal charge of any crime being brought against him. 9. Moreover, despite the fact that the Public Prosecutor’s Department ordered the man's return to Khuzistan a month ago he is still in prison in Tehran. 10. I therefore have no choice but to enter a vigorous protest against what amounts to a flagrant abuse of administrative authority and against the scandal ous delay in operating the legal procedure provided for such cases by the Persian Code. 11. I have to request, therefore, that Your Highness will be so good as to take very urgent steps to ensure that this man is not now returned under arrest to Khuzistan but that he be released w-ithout more ado. 12. 1 am given to understand that no lives were lost in the accident and that the material damage done to the rolling stock w 7 as not considerable and that it has since been repaired and that the Railway Administration has not proceeded with any charge or claim against him. 13. I am therefore convinced that Your Highness will intervene to the best of your ability to ensure that further injustice is not done to this man, and will obtain for me from the Ministry of Justice a full statement of the whole case. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Highness the assurance of iny highest consideration. (9) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 17, dated the 10th Feb ruary 1933. In paragraph 7 of my despatch No. 247 of May 24th 1932 [Serial No. (35) in File No. 1-N.I32], to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of which a copy was sent to Your Excellency under coyer of my despatch No. 101 of the same date, I referred to a Tehran organisation known as the “ Kanun-i-Iran-i-Bastan ” (“ Lamp of Ancient Persia ”) which main tains close touch with Hie Parsi “ Iran League ” of Bombay. 2. The organiser of the “ Kanun-i-Iran-i-Bastan ”, Saif-i-Azad, has now armeared as the editor of a new illustrated journal called the “ Iran-i-Bastan • It is printed mostly in Persian, but a few paragraphs explaining the illustra tions appear in English and there is also, upon the title page, a statement m English of its aims and objects.9 3. This statement reads as follows :— IRAN-E-BAST AN. Illustrated (weekly) News Cormercial and Political. , Chief Editor. —Saif Azad. Aims and Objects. Partisan of the present policy of Persian Empire to uplift Persia to grandieur of ancient Iran. To encourage fraternal sentiments between the Parsees of India and Persians, to stimulate com mercial relations, industrial enterprises and to encourage Parsees to visit Iran frequently.

I enclose copies of the first and second numbers. (Placed with original). 1 he first appeared on 14th January 1933 and the second *on January 28th. In future the paper will be published weekly. It will be seen that the print ing and illustrations are quite moderately good and by no means confined to Par si or Indian subjects. 5. The political views erf the editor may be gauged from the article entitled “ An example of the dark and chaotic state of India ” commenting on the pictures that appear on page 5 of the second number. A translation is attached. [Enclosure to Serial No. (9)]. 6. It is commonly understood in Tehran that Saif-i-Azad is subsidised by the Persian Government to attract Parsi capital, by painting modem Persia in glowing colours and running down British rule' in India. He is also said to be in touch with leading Parsis in Bombay and to have paid a visit to that city, where he made several speeches. According to a possibly prejudiced report the whole scheme was worked out by the late Minister of Court, who paid Saif-i-Azad to make inflammatory anti-British propaganda. Another story is that Saif-i-Azad received an Iron Cross for his services to the German cause during the war. 7. I hope I am correct in supposing that propaganda of this kind is unlikely to make much impression on so intelligent a community as the Parsis of Bombay 8. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Principal Secre tary of State for Foreign Affairs (No. 53). Enclosure to Serial No. (9). Translation of article entitled “ an example of the dark and chaotic state of India ”, published in the “ Iran-e-Babtan ”, Tehran, of 28th Janu ary 1933. However much the British widen the scope of their activities and coercion for preventing the widespread of revolution and public commotion among the Indians, the latter get more courage and increase their audacity and opposition. They are not in the least afraid of being imprisoned or killed. Although thousands of them, men and women have been put to jail in the most abhorrent manner, yet we see hundred thousands of them who have put aside their w T o^k and even their life and have prepared themselves to face the most difficult and bitter experiences. Among other things they refuse to pay taxes, interests on their debts to the hanks and firms, show the strongest opposition towards the orders and decisions issued by the British Government. Inspite of all the recommendations and earnest anneals made bv Ghandi to his followers to abstain from perpetrating any bloodsheds, the Indians have here ami there started a terrorist movement(?) The picture below shows one of the terrible scenes in India. The part of tho riddle of the picture represents a view of the jail at Poona known as Lc333FD10 “ Jarvadara ” (?) where Gandhi and his followers are imprisoned. W e see a flame of fire to which British manufactured goods are put. In front of the fire we see a number of (Indian) women who have set fire to these goods and who are exhorting people most energetically to commotion and violence and also to boycotting British goods. On the left corner of the picture we see Gandhi lecturing his followers ^ while on the right corner we see Patel, the head of the whole Congress in India who has also been imprisoned. On the upper part of the picture we see Lord Willingdon, the Vicernv ^ India, with a drawn face. Although all the leaders of public mind and heads of the country (I n India), men and women have taken to prison with the intention of extinguishing* the fire of commotion and tumult, yet these coercive measures have not had the slightest effect in the activities and national rising of the Indians.

Security was good in the early months of the year but as the effects of the poor rains nia^ie themselves felt brigandage began to increase. In all some six armed robberies occurred on the Sniraz-nJushire road and two on the Shiraz-lsfahan road. In outlying parts of Fars robberies on minor roads were much more numerous. Kiriz, Fasa, Firuzabad and Lar were the regions most affected. The Sorkhi family were responsible for much of the trouble. Jan Mohamed Sorkhi was captured and hanged in July. Another famous brigand, Hadi, was shot. His relatives however took upon themselves to avenge him and were responsible for much trouble round Lar in the last month of the year. The Amnieh was active and on the whole not ineffective. Large numbers of robbers were executed publicly by firing parties in Shiraz. An increase in severity was noted in November and December and protests were made that many men had been shot without proof of brigandage simply for carrying guns. 5. The policy of disarming the tribes and keeping them entirely divorced from their hereditary leaders was pursued vigorously. Hv a law passed on the 7th June 1932 the whole of the properties belonging to the Qawam-ul-Mulk in Fars were transferred to the Government, the Qawam receiving other land m compensation in northern provinces. The blow struck at Sowlat-ud-Dowleh was much more severe. He and his son, deputies to the Majliss and not allowed to leave Tehran, were accused of conspiracy with the tribes and in 1 August were arrested and put in prison where they still were at the end of the year. Ihe nature of the evidence against them does not appear to be entirely convincing. What their eventual fate will be remains a matter for conjecture. The tribes themselves had a very bad year. Lack of water led to great losses amongst their live stock and considerable suffering to them selves. It was impossible in the circumstances to enforce the policv of forcino- the nomads to settle permanently. Some few were persuaded to do so and a new village was built at Tol-i-Khosro in the vicinity of Ardekan for this purpose. ,.. 6 ' r His Imperial Majesty visited Shiraz on October 28th and remained until November 2nd. He appeared very mistrustful of the Shirazis, mounted ins own guard in the Arg and went out very rarely. He treated every one particularly the merchants—in a very cavalier way. His visit added to the fear he inspires but certainly in no way enhanced his popularity. He did his best to find fault with the troops but actually could discover little to criticise It had been rumoured that His Imperial Majesty intended to visit the town of Tol-i-Khosro which he had caused to be built but the visit was not carried out, due it is said to apprehensions as to the attitude of the Boir Ahmedi tribe in that region. 7. Municipal sendees did not launch out into new projects in 1932. One extra khiaban was completed, a few more streets were electrically lit. Bv the end of the year—accelerated undoubtedly by the Shah’s visit—Shiraz * pre sented an appearance of orderliness and completeness few other Persian towns can equal. A great deal of new building took place during the year a form of investment to which merchants here frequently turn in bad trading times—and the favoured side of the city was the western side. The Indo^ European Telegraph Department property was sold in the first half of the year, not to the opium monopoly department who were once in the field as possible buyers, but to a little knjown merchant. The roads in and around Shiraz were well maintained and the stretch Shiraz to Abadeh was so o- 0 od as to evoke favourable comment from the Shah. The excavations at Persepolis financed bv the Oriental Institute (a branch of the University of Chicago) continued under the guidance of Professor Herzfeld and a number of important finds were made including a very fine stairway in excellent preservation. . The health of the town was good throughout the year. There were no serious epidemics although the standard of life of the * poorer classes was still further reduced and manv evidences of extreme poverty were to be seen The building of the Church Missionary Society new hospital went on and in suite of a fire which destroyed the roof in May and caused about 300 pounds damage was practically completed by the end of the‘year. 8. The effect of the cancellation of the d’Aycy Concession in Shiraz is worth mentiouiucr. In ereneral the population here seems to be friendlv dis posed to the British ; it is certain that the demonstrations of joy over the“ deliverance ” of Persia were enforced by Government officials. An atmosphere of antagonism was engenaered and- for a short time there was a very detimte avoidance of contact with British residents by all Persians. This attitude, however, changed after about a month and by Christmas normal friendly relations were resumed. Although at Christmas cards were left by a number of officials it is impossible for British officials here to enter into friendly relations with any but the Gove 1 mor General. Until the visit of the Shah the Head of the Finance Department was extremely friendly with all foreign residents but since then has “ dropped ” them completely. 9. Trading conditions were poor throughout the year. The opium trade was practically at a standstill. the gums, hides and carpets fetched very low prices . in foreign markets and as a result of the inflated export to meet the requirements of the Trade Monopoly Law demand declined as the year advanced. The chief change in the character of trade has been the loss of ground by the Russians in the face of Japanese competition ; relatively the English share of the piecegoods market did not alter very much, but fell off in volume. “ Luxury ” goods of any sort have practically disappeared from the Shiraz bazaar and are not being replaced. Towards the end of the year the “ deadness ” of the bazaar w^as very obvious ; casual visitors were struck by the emptiness of them and the forlorn look of the neglected shops. After the criticism of the Shah efforts were made to float a companv for working a cotton spinning and weaving mill. Some progress was made but by the close of 1932 it was still doubtful whether the project would materia lise in spite of heavy pressure from the Governor General.' . 10 - Th 1 e school connected with the Church Missionary Societv, although a primary school continued open.

Demi-official letter from the Chancery, British Embassy, Berlin, to the Eastern Department, Foreign Office, London, No. 124j3|33, dated the 1st February 1933. In our despatch No. 90 of the 27th January we reported the appointment of Herr Horschitz-Horst to be Manager of the National Bank in Tehran. We now learn that Herr Horschitz-Horst, who is 53 years of age, was at one time the representative of a French Bank in Berlin and later spent some time in Eg&gt; pt as Director of a Mortgage Bank where he came into contact with Sir Ernest Cassel. After the war he held an appointment with the Disconto-Gesellschaft (1924-27) and, more recently, has been acting as the representative in Germany of the Standard Oil Company. On the reorganisation of this business he lost his post. The Persian Government has not, we learn, consulted the German Government about their choice on the present occasion and very little is known in Government circles about Herr Horschitz-Horst. He was apparently recommended to the Persian Government by private interests. (13) Despatch from His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 70, dated the 20th February 1933. As 1 have reported by telegram, His Imperial Majesty the Shah received me yesterday morning in order that Lieutenant-Colonel Dodd might take his leave of His Majesty on the termination of his appointment as Military Attache to this Legation. The Shah, with good humoured earnestness, expressed the hope that Colonel Dodd would resume normal military duties, indicating that in his experience true happiness was only to be found in the ranks of the armv. (ulonel Dodd replied suitably and the Shah wished him goodbye, saying that in wishing him all prosperity his good wishes included the British army. . 2. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, who interpreted, had told me that His Majesty wished to have a talk with me, and tea and cigarettes were then brought in. 3. His Majesty began the conversation a little unsuccessfully bv suggesting that this was my first winter here. We then compared this winter with last and I hazarded the suggestion that the mildness of this winter was responsible for the epidemic of influenza ; I was glad to think that His Majesty had quite recovered from Ids attack. His Majesty’s health and the mention of winter served as an introduction to an enquiry after the Valiadh and whether he was keen on winter sports. His Majesty’s reply was to the effect that he was afraid that he was too keen and might damage himself skiing. And this led me to aeroplanes via Mr. Buckingham, who is now here, having delivered the Tiger Moth aeroplanes, recently acquired by the Persian Government, and who is a first- rate performer on skis. His Majesty said that he was very pleased with these machines and mentioned the loss of one through the incompetence of the pilot ;md suggested that it would be a good advertisement for the Company to replace it. I replied that I would repeat his words to Mr. Buckingham, expressed my gratification at His Majesty’s satisfaction with the machines, said that our experts were fully convinced that British machines were the best in the world and mentioned the great flight to South Africa. His Majesty had seen an account of the flight and quite agreed about the supremacy of our aeroplanes. 4. At this point, I formed the impression that His Majesty was waiting for me to falk business and I mentioned the impending departure of Sir J. Cadman and his collaborators for Tehran. His Majesty replied that Davar had reported this and that he hoped Sir John would be prepared to reach a satisfactory settle ment. He quite understood that the directors must have the welfare of the share holders at heart Imt he felt that, considering the great interest that both the British and Persian Governments had in the concern, the directors should not regard it as a simple money making business like any ordinary Company. He hoped that His Majesty’s Government took a similar view, blit he feared that they were not animated by friendly feelings towards Persia and did not share his desire for good relations, of which evidence was furnished by the attitudeand conduct of the Persian Government subsequent to the cancellation of the concession. I suggested, in repty, that when the Persian Government pressed the Company to send a mission here last spring to embark on negotiations, they had no idea how grave a crisis threatened the industry as a whole : the obvious and urgent need was for the leading Oil Companies to determine measures to save the industry from collapse. It was no great exaggeration to compare the action of the Persian Government last spring, when they required the Company to send representatives here in order to discuss and establish a new basis for their relations, with that of a landlord who with the house already on fire wished his tenant to start talking about details affecting the maimer in which he paid his rent. As for His Majesty’s Government and their views on the subject of Persia they were unchanged : their interest in the Anglo-Persia Oil Company, their desire to see the world settle down and prosper and every other possible con sideration must convince His Majesty that there was no deliberate hostility. I wondered whether his impression that the policy of His Majesty’s Government was hostile to Persia was not the result of attaching undue importance to what he had read in the press. This question was not fully understood and it was necessary to explain that I meant the adverse criticism of the Persian Govern ment which appeared in the foreign press subsequent to the cancellation of the d’Arcy concession. His Majesty replied that he did not attach great importance to press polemics in general and none at all to scurrilous personal attacks to which persons who had acquired some measure of prominence were always exposed. But he felt that the attitude of His Majesty’s Government was not a just one. He also felt that the entire financial loss resulting from the world crisis should not fall on one party only but should be fairly distributed. As I had used a simile, he would too, and say that Persia was a man on the verge of suffocation and His Majesty’s Government apparently objected to his fighting for breath. 5. I replied that His Majesty was entitled to hold this view, hut I thought he must admit that His Majesty’s Government were fully justified in regarding the cancellation of the d’Arcy concession as an attack on*our rights which we had to resist. 1 said this a little aggressively, rather expecting it to be ill- received. Feroughi may, of course, have toned it down, but anyhow the Shah answered quite amicably that we were entitled to defend our interests. fi. At tliis point I concluded that the Shah had had enough and I therefore asked I eroughi to say again that the desire of my Government was to see a prosperous and stable Persia. His Majesty, in language frequently reminiscent of Teymourtache’s letter enclosed in Sir R. Clive’s despatch No. 361 of July 8th, 1931, explained that a Persia, master in her own house, with a patriotic Govern ment sufficiently strong to run an independent foreign policy, should he one of our political goals, but he greatly feared that this was not the case and that we resented all manifestations of independence. 7. I assured His Majesty that almost all of what he had just said would have been quite suitable for inclusion in a speech by you on Anglo-Persian relations, but that his conclusion was quite wrong. 8. It would ho interesting to know how Feroughi put this into Persian. Up io a point the Shah listened with the impassivity which I imagine he has cultivated, and then started and ejaculated an angry “ what ? Feroughi made a second attempt, this time with entire success as the Shah laughed with every appearance of real good humour. Shortlv afterwards he terminated the audience. 9. On.reconstructing the conversation, I notice that I failed to take up the point made by the Shah that “ the entire loss should not fall on one partv only U J hat he should have said this makes it, I think, abundantly clear that he believes the decline m the Persian royalty to have been out of all proportion to the ( e( ino in the receipts oi the share-holders and in the income-tax received by His iMajesty s Government, and it now seems to me possible that a slightlv childish sense of being unfairly treated as well as actual anger at the smallness of the loyalty provoked what Feroughi in the course of the audience called the “ geste ” oi cancellation. Other remarks also suggested that the Companv was unfair. 10. Of course all this, and the Shah’s alleged fear that His Majesty’s -o\ ernmon s disposition is “ unfriendly ”, can be dismissed as merely an aspect o orn n a mi gaming, but T do not see that we should g'ain anything hv so doing. A m Jll C r&lt; Tu 71t stron ?ty Hie impression that it would be well worth while the ; rtm&lt;u strongly under the impression that it would he well worth wh o Prepare e giound for the actual negotiations bv trying to remove some tbe tol^h s misapprehensions. This might he attempted by drawing up in 116 at all is shown to prove that the last paragraph of the Minister of Finance's letter of the 27th November last cancelling the concession is being complied with The “ iShafaq ”, it is true, expresses regret that that paragraph was inserted at all ; but the impression which the Tehran papers impart is that all is going well from Persia’s point ot view. 2. The u Shafaq-i-Surkh ” of the 10th February sought to fan the flames of xenophobia by publishing an article by a well-known “ comic man ” entitled “ Maxim’s Tavern Sarcastic references are made to the loose and immoral conduct of foreigners (one of whom, a young French school teacher is named) who visit Tehran night clubs such as “ Maxim’s Tavern ” and the “ Bar Lili ” and thereby set such a bad example to the youth of Persia, whose women are still adorned by that protector of modesty, the veil. 3. The “ Shafaq ” of the 11th February fulminates against the statement quoted from the “ Near East ” of the 26th January to the effect that “ If the- arguments placed before the League of Nations have any importance for Persians they have none for anyone else The Persian paper ironically savs that the oil dispute certainly has a great deal of importance for Persia ; it is a matter which concerns the Persians vitally, and they will and must prove before the-world that their national rights must be respected. “ We wish to prove to the world that we insist on having what belongs to us ; we do not covet what belongs to others. We will show that a concession wrung from us when we were a small state through pressure or ignorance will be rescinded now that we have attained maturity.” 4 The same paper of the 13th February inveighs against another observation in the same article, to the effect that Persia, even if she had been wronged at the commencement of the d’Arcy concession, and even if she was suffering losses should nevertheless loyally keep to her bargain according to the terms of the concession. The writer of the article says that he would have been ashamed to write such an observation. “ Is it possible to propose to a Government that it should continue to suffer losses and to renounce its vital interests in consequence of the acts of its ignorant predecessor, the dupe of the Russians and the English ? ” “ But we must not be surprised at this statement in the 4 Near East ’, as that paper is the organ of the British Ministry of the Colonies.” 5. Oii the 14th February a series of articles on Mraq began. The newly independent Iraqian state is taken to task for allowing the well-known rebel, Jaafar Sultan, whom it had promised to retain and restrain from further attacks on 1 ersia, to return to the Perso-’Iraq frontier area and re-eommenee his resistance to the Persian Government. Subsequent articles corrected the first statement by admitting that Jaafar Sultan himself had not been released, but that the trouble was being caused by some of his many sons. The “ Sitareh-i- Jahan ” of the 15th February agrees with its confrere the “ Shafaq ” of the previous day that these attacks are not unconnected with the oil question. “ We know now sa\ s the “ Sitareh ”, why the British have been announcing with such insistence the existence of tribal unrest in Persia. Their conduct reminds us of the story of the man who rented a house froiji a landlord at a rent of two tomans per month. The landlord one day wished to raise the rent to three tomans. 1 he tenant did not agree, but closed all-the windows and smeared the house at night with petrol and pet fire to it. In the morning he said to the land- oid Did I not tell you that if I went out of this house or even if we were to discuss my leaving, the house would catch fire ? ” “ But perhaps the landlord will be awake, and will catch the hand of the tenant ajs he is setting Are to the match ; so that he can hand him over to the courts and hand over his house to some worthier and better tenant.” r 10 16th February criticises in detail the article . 10 . . ear j . °f 2nd February. Points made are : (1) the article insu ting, and reminds one of the scurrilous articles which used to appear i ersia m the bad old days, (2) its abusive tone shows that the British a alarmed at the weakness of their case, (3) the statement that the Persian Gover Mont s memorandum resembles the work of newspaper writers rather than government document is ridiculous—it shows exactly what the “ Near Fast dselt a newspaper, thinks of newspaper-writers, (4) the statement that f league of Nations ought to be treated with greater respect is ridiculed—t p! 00 , mt Die League of Nations thought the Persian document a sound one w; 1°. that flie Persians won at Geneva, in spite of the tremendous inflnen w i-o.i the powerful British Government exercises on the League ; and (5) fl statement that Persian writers know nothing about oil is ridiculed ; they kno as much as the writer of the “ Near East ” at any rate * V■■■ 17 7. The 11 Koo^hish ” of the 20th February gives a description of the luncheon party given by Davar at the Hotel Beau Rivage on Saturday, the 4th February, attended by Mr. Anthony Eden, Monsieur Benes, Mcyisieur Avenol, Colonel Riazi, and others ; and ends by saying that it was felt by all that there was now a hope that the oil dispute would be settled to everyone’s satisfaction without any further reference to the League. 8. Subsequent papers have published little on the subject of oil except for certain translations from foreign writers ; a long series entitled “ The Oil War ” in the “ Ittila’at ” and a new series of articles in the “ Shafaq ” from the pen of a certain Abdullah Dashti dealing with geological researches in the south of Persia, have helped to keep attention fixed on the great dispute. 9. The trial of Diba, and the arrangements for the forthcoming trial of Teymourtache, have also furnished good copy ; they are reported in a separate despatch. The celebrations on the occasion of the twelfth anniversary of the Coup d’Etat of 1921 on the 23rd February have also filled several columns : long description of the complicated manoeuvres of the troops and of the new aeroplanes are accompanied, in the “ Ittila’at ” of the 23rd February, by photographs show ing His Majesty taking the salute with his back to the camera, and a side view of several Ministers watching the spectacle. 10. 1 am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 30) and to His Majestv’s Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 14). (15) Despatch fuom His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 78, dated the 25th February 1933. The veil of mystery surrounding the present circumstances and future fate of Teymourtache has been partially lifted by recent announcements in Tehran newspapers. The newspaper ‘ Tajaddud-i-Iran ’ on the 11th February announced that the preliminary investigations into the offences of the ez-Ministei* of Court had been completed and that his trial would take place shortly. The ‘ Tran ’ of the 20th February stated that he had been arrested and taken to the Police prison. The ‘ Tajaddud-i-Iran ’ of the next day, however, was more explicit. It said that as the result of the investigations of the 1 juge d’instruc tion of the Secret Police, and of the criminal court, Teymourtache had been transferred from his residence to the Qasr-i-Qajar prison on the 16th February. Owing to heart attacks he had forthwith been admitted to the hospital of that institution where he was being treated. The accusations against the prisoner were partly connected with his interference with the affairs of the National Bank and with his irregular operations in the foreign exchange market. The Public Prosecutor of the Criminal Court for Government Servants went to the National Bank on the 21st February to examine the dossier relating to the accused in prder to prepare the statement of indictment. The paper proceeds : “ Accord ing to information received it appears that claims against the accused for upwards of two hundred thousand Tomans have been filed by private persons and firms ; and we learn that property of the accused to the value of nineteen thousand Tomans has been sequestered in connection with his debt to the Pahlevi Bank.” At any rate there is, for the present, no talk of charges of treason, such as the acceptance of bribes from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company or the Soviet Embassy, with which public gossip has been much occupied. Such charges would probably have been tried by a military court. 2. I learnt from the Minister of War, Jaafar Quli As’ad, on the 18th February that the Shah had decided to punish the err-Minister of Court to the full ; and that all As’ad’s efforts to delay the trial on the grounds that it was doubtful before what court the accused could be tried had been of no avail (the difficulty about his being a Minister and so amenable only to the High Court of Appeal—which tried Firuz Mirza—has been surmounted by a decision that a Minister of Court is an official and not a responsible Minister). I imagine that His Excellency himself, as a well-known friend of the prisoner, feels none too safe from the royal wrath and therefore has not ventured to go very far with His Majesty ; but I believe he has done his best. 3. The newspaper report that the Public Prosecutor proceeded on the 21st February to examine the books of the National Bank is hardly compatible with the fact, which every body has known for a long time, that Teymourtache’s deal ings with the Bank have been under thorough examination since he was placed Lc333FD18 under arrest, and indeed that, from the very beginning of the National Bank scandal, great efforts have been made by the investigators to establish a case against him. It appears that the Shah has ordered that the full rigour of criminal procedure should be enforced against his former favourite. The Minister of War’s belief, according to what he told Mr. Jacks some little time ago, is that what caused the present turn of events was the article which appeared ^ in the ‘ Times ’ of the 9th January ‘ from a correspondent recently in Persia ’. ^ This article stated that the Shah was some years over sixty (he is actually fifty- eight) “ which is equivalent to seventy-five in Western countries ” and in poor health : in consequence, the prospect of a Regency occupied his mind—“ What chance would his thirteen year old son have, should the Regency fall to a man still young, ambitious and entirely unscrupulous ! The safety of the dynasty can be ensured only by removing all men of outstanding ability and the substitu tion of less striking and less independent figures such as the present Minister for Foreign Affairs About a fortnight ago there were persistent reports that the Shah had decided to pardon Teymourtache and exile him to his estates in Khorassan. Some said that this was the result of an appeal made to his father by the Valiadh, who is at school with Teymourtache’s son in Switzerland. But the reports ceased suddenly, and it seems to me exceedingly probable that the ‘ Times ’ article worked the change, though whether because the Shah’s suspicious nature found in it the authentic voice of wisdom, or because he was enraged at the allusions to his age and at the doubts expressed further on in the article as to the ability of Persia to carry on without Teymourtache, I should hesitate to form an estimate. 4. Meanwhile the trial of the former Court Treasurer, Abdul Hussein Khan Diba, has been proceeding. An opening session on the 12th February, before a large number of the public, petered out in formalities ; the second session, on the 19th February, before an even greater crowd, heard a great deal of evidence ; and the next sitting is to take place on the 2nd March. The accusation of taking a bribe of two thousand Tomans is denied by the accused ; the evidence is reported in great detail in all the papers and the whole proceedings have a strictly legal appearance. 1 shall not fail to report the eventual outcome which Tehran believes may quite likely be the acquittal of Diba, who is expected to provide useful evidence against Teymourtache. The latter has, I believe, told his daughter that he will be condemned to ten years’ imprisonment. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 31), and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 15). (16) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 82, dated the 25th February 1933. T reported at some length in my despatch No. 55-A. of February 11th [Serial No. (49)] on the restrictions which are being placed with increasing stringency on the acceptance by Persians of foreign hospitality. Since then a certain Habibulla Rashidi, who for over twenty years has called at frequent intervals to give the Oriental Secretary of the day “ the talk of the town ” has been arrested. About three weeks previously Mr. Trott had asked him whether he would not be wise to keep away from the Legation for a short time, but he pooh poohed the suggestion, saying that there was not the slightest danger and the police knew all about him. The Chief of Police, when questioned by Mr. Trott, made no pretence that there was any charge against him and declared that he would be released at once if I informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he was in the employ of the Legation. He was himself in no way responsible as the arrest was ordered by the “ police deSurete ” which was not under his control. 2. I have told the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who said that he had no knowledge of the affair, that he knjew as well as I did that in the past a consi derable intelligence service was run by this Legation, directed against Russian activities in the days of Persia’s weakness. He also knew perfectly well that the times having changed, our organisation ceased to exist. If the man were a spy I should be debarred by common usage from interesting myself in his case, but spies did not come in by the front gate of a Legation in broad l^yfight.

Enclosure to Serial No. (19). Report on Campaign undertaken against Lur Tribesmen. An autumn campaign was undertaken against the Lur tribesmen. It has been a matter of some conjecture, why the Government has not pre\ xously dealt with this outbreak. The official policy for some time past has been to deport the Lurs to settlements in other parts of Persia. When villages and nomadic camps were rounded up by troops, it was to be expected that women and children were chiefly collected and in this manner large parties of Lur tribesmen were made homeless and desperate by the loss of their families and outlawed by the action of the Government. These have been successful y raiding for some months past, and have collected a large quantity of grain cloth and stores from lorries which have been regularly looted on the Dizful-Khurramabad-Burujird Two incidents of special importance were the kidnapping of a party of officials, including the Governor of Khurramabad, m July and the holding up of a large number of motor vehicles on the Hamadan-Kermanshah road on the 3rd September, when three American consular representatives were tempoianly captured by the tribesmen. It is said on good authority that a colonel who was abducted with the Governor of Khurramabad, was subsequently shot in Tehran by direct order ot the Shah for displaying cowardice on that occasion. The autumn campaign consisted of an enveloping movement. The Kermanshah Regiment and the Muzaffar Infantry Regiment, the latter from tJie Kurdistan Brigade, with headquarters at Senneh, were employed to the norm and west. A strong detachment from Tehran, consisting of the Bahadur regi ment (3rd Regiment, 1st Brigade) and four squadrons of cavalry, one from eacn regiment of the Central Garrison, was sent to reinforce the permanent troops the area, namely, the Luristan Brigade, whose headquarters are at Khurramaiiau. The commander of this brigade* Sarhang Mehdi Quli Baksh, was superseded, and Sarhang Haji Ali Khan, Razm Ara, commanding e e shah Regiment, was appointed to succeed him. A detachment from Isfahan is also said to have taken part in the operations. The total number of troops employed was approximately 7,000, undei the command of Sartip Murteza Khan and Sipah Bod (marshal). uie &amp; Khan was in chief control, civil and military, of the whole area. Certain sources state that as many as thirteen aircraft are being emp nye based on Khurramabad, and that two or three of these have come to g ri .^ • are figures are, however, probably an exaggeration, but five or six an f , f() certainly at Khurramabad in connexion with these operations and one at Ahwaz. r , en It is difficult to estimate the number of the rebels, but they may haV ^ up to 3,000, under the leadership of Yadullah Khan, Bairanwand, wh Ghulam Ali Khan, had been publicly executed in Khurramabad. . The rebels consist very largely of the Bairanwand secti , 011 ’ ^Vto be important Saigawand are more or less neutral. The Kakawand P or(ler on the side of the Government, and have, to some extent, been arine that they may assist the regular troops on occasion. The Lurs have with them a senior cir-officer, Sarhang Gign. This man* ve witn tnem a senior ea&gt;umcer, oamcm* some two years ago, was sentenced to a term of imprisonment smuggling at Hamadan, but escaped from the Qasr Kajar prison and ‘ reach Luristan.The tribesmen were very short of arms and ammunition at the commence ment of the operations, but are reported to have collected sufficient for their present needs from the conscript soldiers who show no desire to fight and freely surrender their arms and equipment. The following is an extract from a report received from Kermanshah :•— “A half-company (of the Kermanshah Regiment), led by Captain Shahpur Khan, a promising young officer, was ambushed at Tang-i- Shir and suffered serious casualties. The men, all recruits of four months’ service, threw down their arms after their officers had been killed and were allowed to go, on showing that they were conscripts. The Lurs made off with all the arms and ammunition, including a machine gun. The losses of the military are estimated at twenty- four forty .men. A few wounded reached the Kermanshah hos pital.” The success of the revolt in Luristan has had some effect on neighbouring tribes and it is reported from both Kermanshah and Ahwaz that crime is on the increase, and local tribesmen and bad characters are committing raids and robberies which are credited to the Lurs. Sartip Murteza Khan has now returned to Tehran and been given command of the following troops, which he has orders to equip and prepare as an expedi tionary force presumably to be used as reinforcements against the Lurs. All sources agree that the creation of this force has no connexion with the Anglo- Persian Oil Company affair :— Two regiments of infantry (6 battalions). One regiment of cavalry. Two batteries of artillery. These troops were still in Tehran on the 31st December. ( 20 ) (Received informally S. V. on 12th March 1933.) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 567, dated the 29th December 1932. No. 1. Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received January 17, 1933.) I indicated in my telegram No. 244 of the 27th December [Serial No. (66)] that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had very little information to give on the subject of the dismissal of Teymourtache from his functions as Minister of Court. I did not think it worth while to telegraph that he hazarded the indecisive opinion that the main reason was the Shah’s dissatisfaction at his continuing to associate with Diba after his dismissal (see my despatch No. 508 of the 2nd December). 2. It appears, however, that the Diba connexion is to be at least the official version, as the Minister of War, who is not usually very voluble, told a long story last night to the effect that the presence of Diba at the Court had always been distasteful to the Shah, who had made his views known to Teymourtache without obtaining any response. 3. Finally the Shah plainly intimated to Teymourtache that he did not want to see Diba again and he waited patiently for some considerable time for Teymourtache to give effect to his wishes. .There was still no response, and so His Majesty was compelled to take action himself, and having taken action, the Shah hoped that Teymourtache would cease to be on intimate terms with a man who was notoriously disreputable (this is true, even by Persian standards) ; to make sure, however, he instructed the police to report Teymourtache’s move ments, and to his indignation he learnt that the intimacy between the Teymourtache and Diba family continued. This, we are to understand, was an assertion of individual liberty which could not be brooked, and the Shah instructed his personal secretary to inform Teymourtache that his presence was no longer required at the Court. Teymourtache thereupon requested the Minister of War to intercede on his behalf and a reply came back that the Shah desired him not to leave his house for a fortnight, that he appreciated the services which he had rendered, but that for political reasons he could not, for the present, be Lc333FD22 entrusted with any official functions. None Ihe less, the Shah would be very i»lad to see him and receive his advice on political matters at Ireqnent intervals. 4. There is in all this one thins: that I know to be a fact, that Tevmourtache went to the cinema with Diba and his wife on the day, or the day after, that Diba was dismissed. For the rest, the story can be accepted, but only as an act of faith. 5. There are, of course, many other stories :— One of the most civilised Persians of my acquaintance appears to believe that Teymourtache has fallen into disgrace because he has shown himself too favourable to British interests and has accepted money Irom the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Others maintain that the affairs of the National Bank are the main cause of the trouble, and they have in support of their opinion the fact that (as reported in my despatch No. 352) Teymourtache undoubtedly had an extremely unpleasant interview with the Shah in August, after the investigations into the affairs of the bank had been in progress for two months. Another theory is that the Shah is becoming anxious about his son’s future, not being over-confident of his own expectation of life. He accordingly decided that Teymourtache was too prominent and that a regency in which Teymourtache would inevitably play the leading part would be a short one. Yet another theory is that the Shah had suddenly made up his mind that Teymourtache has, for his own ends, delayed a settlement both with His Majesty’s Government and with the Soviet Government and has thereby brought about the one result which Persia should avoid, i.e., uneasy relations with both Powers. . . . j » Finally we are told that Teymourtache and Diba are to be haled before a court-martial. 6. I dare say that many factors have contributed something to the Shah’s decision ; I do not, however, believe that the Shah would have dismissed his Minister of Court if he had felt entirely happy as to the outcome of the cancella tion of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Concession. 7. On learning the news of Teymourtache’s dismissal 1 wrote him a short personal note indicating my regret at the severance of our official relations and saying that the discussions on the subject of the general treaty which we had had would remain a happy memory, sorry though I was that we had been unable to reach a final conclusion. I received a cordial reply in which Teymourtache expressed his appreciation of the efforts which I had made to solve outstanding questions. 8. It is believed that the Shah does not intend to attempt to find a substitute for Teymourtache, but will now act more directly as his own Prime Minister and always be accessible to members of the Government. The prospect is rather alarming as it seems likely that in some cases irrevocable decisions, such as that cancelling the D’Arcy Concession, will be lightly taken and that in others no decision whatsoever will be obtainable ; it is noteworthy that since Taghi Z ideh shook off the yoke of Teymourtache and obtained real control of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs finds it impossible, when called upon to intervene on behalf of a foreign mission, to get anything done. 9. It must be imagined that the Shah realises that Teymourtaehe is the only swan amongst his flock of geese, and I therefore hope that what I have called the official version is so far true that His Majesty will not take against him nn&gt; extreme measures which would render his return to a position of authority impossible. (Received on 5th March 1933, unth Political Secretary's letter No. P.Z.-7, dated the 16th February 1933.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. E.-610|610|34, dated 13th Febru ary 1933. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 9, dated the 14th January 1933. I have recently received, from a variety of sources, information that ^ M jesty the Shah has issued instructions that no Persian subject, sa^ Vexceptional circumstances, should visit any ioreign iiimbassy or Legation. My colleagues nave an necird tne same story, anu niiiiougn tne memuers ol' the Ministry tor -foreign iinairs deny it, and we nave no documentary evidence to go upon, i have the nonour to bring to your notice tne evidence wmcn leads me to think that the story is not ill-founded. 2. The hrst story 1 heard was tnat on the morning of a dance which I gave lor the -British colony and some others on tne 28th Tecember last His Majesty announced to the Minister for Foreign Adairs that he had decided tiiat no Persian was in future to visit foreign Legations. Feroughi replied that he had already accepted an invitation to a dance at the Britisn Legation ; was he to refuse at the last moment 1 The Shah asked whether other Persians had been invited, and Feroughi imagined that some had been bidden, to which His Majesty replied that they could go, but it was to be for the last time. X subsequently heard the same story told about the Minister of War, Sardar As’ad ; and from a fellow-Bakhtiari (Sardar Zafar, K.B.E.), a member of my staff received a message that, although he was too well known a friend of the British to believe that he was forbidden to come to the Legation, yet he had heard that the Shah wished people not to mix with foreigners, and so preferred to keep away for the present. The President of the Majlis, after accepting my invitation to the dance on the 28th, did not appear : he sent an elaborate letter of apology the next day. Several members of my staff have noticed that Persians who used to come to their houses now make excuses and stay away. The most striking example of avoidance of a foreign Legation was, however, the refusals sent to the German Minister by a number of Persians whom he had invited to dine ; the excuse in each case being a previous engagement, though the invitations had been sent out fully ten days in advance. 3. All these indications seem to show that His Majesty, on or about the 28th December, did issue some order or warning against normal social relations ■vith foreign representatives. My Italian colleague talks of resigning from the Iran Club ” as a protest ; and in ordinary intercourse with Persians an air of urisomfortable uncertainty prevails. 4. At about the same time that the Shah is thought to have issued this remarkable order, Mirza Hussein Khan Ala is reported to have brought to the Shah’s notice the fact that the committee of investigation which had been examining the affairs of the National Bank of Persia had brought to light defalcations or losses to the amount of some 3 million tomans. It is possible to connect the two events, that is, to suppose that the loss of so large a sum as the result of the incapacity or obliquity of two foreigners fanned the flames of His Majesty’s normal aversion for them. 5. Again, the Shah’s anger at the failure of what he probably considered a more or less natural move in the negotiations with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and the subsequent firm attitude of His Majesty’s Government when faced with the Persian Government’s sudden confiscatory act, may also have been a contributor cause for the order. 6. It may be of interest to recapitulate a few previous facts which appear to point to a permanent, and increasing, xenophobia in the mind of the autocratic ruler of Persia, ignorant a^ he is, not only of foreign countries, but also of the mentality of foreigners. 7. From the beginning of Keza Shah’s reign it has been evident that he wished to curtail all intercourse between military officers and foreign Legations. It was not until last year that a definite order was issued to all officers to refrain from all such intercourse, but previously the Shah’s wishes in this respect were well known and generally observed. 8. The abolition of the Capitulations in 1926 was hailed (according to careful instructions) as a step forward towards the great goal of freedom from the foreigners’ yoke. Not long after this foreign Legations were gradually subjected to an annoying interference in the choice of Persians whom they were allowed to invite to their official parties ; an order being finallv issued (it is still in force) that no Persian functionary of a rank lower than the eighth class of official could be present at such a function. Persian officials, when, taxed with this stupid rule, fall back on the ingenious argument that the Persian Govern ment imposed these wise regulations in order to safeguard foreign Legations’ prestige. 9. Then, in 1929, we learnt from Miss Posita Forbes that the Shah himself told her that in a few years he hoped that there would not be a foreigner in24 Persian employ. Again, we can observe the increasing difficulties of the missionary schools in Persia, both British and American, m carrying on their work ; culminating in the complete suppression of all foreign primary schools last year. Humours (the truth of which Teymourtache categorically denied when I questioned him two months ago) still persist of draconian legislation soon to be passed by the Majlis, which would practically make it impossible for ^ European doctors to practise in Persia. 10. His Majesty has in recent years been less and less inclined to receive foreign representatives in audience, it would be going too tar to cite the various monopoly regulations, exchange restrictions and passport regulations as a proof of design to make the foreigner^ position more difficult ; their true explanation may be economic pressure from Russia, or retaliatory measures, or simply officious incapacity : but the result on the whole has been to make Persia a more and more uncomfortable country to live in. 11. The latest manifestation of xenophobia is a strange notice which appeared in the Persian press on the 7th and 8th January, 1933, issued, by the Municipality of Tehran. It draws attention to the fact that most of the shops in Tehran have their signs inscribed with titles in foreign characters, for example, “ Bonheur, ” “ Hotel Bristol,” “ Salon de Coiffure Figaro,” etc., and states that “ as everybody must agree that this practice is in opposition with national prestige and national dignity, all shop proprietors are warned that from the 21st March next all shop signs must be inscribed in large Persian letters with the foreign characters in smaller type below.” Whether this nationalistic fervour originated from His Majesty or from his trusted servant, the uncouth General Kerim Agha Buzarjumihri (the head of the municipality) is not known. 12. I have personally had so few opportunities of observing His Majesty that I cannot record any direct evidence from personal observation of coldness towards foreigners. Perhaps the truth of the matter is that His Majesty, whose choleric outbursts of rage are well known and appear to be becoming more frequent wuth old age, is, on the subject of foreigners, slightly demented. Secure in absolute power over his country’s internal affairs, uncontrolled by any criticism of his arbitrary actions and abysmally ignorant of what foreigners really say and think, he may be convinced that the real obstacle to the millennium in Persia is the foreigner, who must * therefore be got rid of by all possible means. 13. Some day, no doubt, a learned psychologist will explain to us precisely why oriental nationalism cannot, in its early stages at any rate, develop alon? lines which we regard as those of sanity. Experience in Turkey and in Egypt in the palmy days of Nahas Pasha seem to me to prove that it is impossible, and the first reactions of the Iraqi press to the news of the cancellation of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company concession displayed a similar tendency. 14. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 2). ( 22 ) Telegram R., from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign, New Delhi, No. 17, dated the 19th March 1933.

He did not under stand what his motives had been but at every turn he had favoured Soviet interests—see my Despatch No. 390 (File No. 1-N.|32). 2. Consul’s impression was that Chief of Police was speaking spontaneously and believed what he said. 3. On the other hand there seems to be no doubt that it was Taimourtache wtio inspired campaign which has resulted in present crisis in commercial rela- tions with Russia—see my Despatch No. 421 [Serial No. (38) in File No 391- J\.|31].

I learn, however, that he is being sent back to Ahwaz for apparently yet a further examination. 2. I have already informed Your Highness of my views on this case and I have the honour to add that I will watch any further developments with the closest interest. I avail myself of thi^ opportunity to renew’ to Your Highness the assurance of my highest consideration. (29) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 100, dated the Hth March 1933. In continuation of my despatch No. 78 of February 25th last [Serial No. (15)] I have the honour to report that on February 25th the “ Tajaddud ” published a curious report about the trial of the ca;-Minister of Court. The newspaper stated that it was inaccurate to say that Teymourtache had been examined and interrogated by a Judge d’Instruction with a view 7 to his trial : “ The Parquet has hitherto only been examining matters connected with the affair ; and Doctor Lindenblatt has also been the subject of legal investiga tions ”. 2. On March 8th the “ Iran ” published a statement that the trial would take place before the Criminal Court for the examination of Government servants. A formal accusation against him had been deposited with the Court by the public prosecutor, the charges being those of bribery (presumably accepting bribes is meant), embezzlement and fraud ; the total sum claimed from him being one thousand eight hundred pounds and more than one million rials. 3. The “ Tajaddud ” of the same day published an article as follows :— At 10-30 a.m. to-day Abdul Hussein Khan Teymourtache attended the Court (First Section) of Criminal Procedure against Government officials under the supervision of officials in order to go through the dossier of his case and appoint and introduce his lawyer to the court. According to information received, he has appointed Mr. Shariat-Zadeh Guilani (he is really a Mazandarani, translator) as his defending counsel. He w 7 as sent back to the Qasr-i-Qajar prison. 4. The same paper reports that Shariat Zadeh has excused himself from accepting the task of defending Teymourtache, wdio has therefore appointed two other lawyers named Seyed Hashim and Ahmed Khan M ugh be! to defend him. I learn that up to the present they have not been allowed access to him. 5. Rumour (there is no better source of information) suggests that reymour- tache is not facing his accusers with fortitude, or with the bravado that migh expected from him. He is obviously a very sick man and may even have receiv ^ some phvsical ill-treatment in prison. Whatever the cause, he is said to broken dowm and wept before the examining magistrates. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretarv th_ e Government of India (No. 45) and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagn &gt; (No. 21). 30 (30) ■ O ice, Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign f London, No. 105, dated the 11th March 1933. Seven months have elapsed since, in discussing the internal situation Lj? I suggested in my despatch No. 352 of August 12th last (File No. l-N-yw,aerrram 27 if the Shah did not deal promptly and severely with the insurgent Lur tribesmen it would perhaps be because he was uneasy and unwilling to despatch troops from the capital. I reverted to this point in my despatch No. 80 of February 25th, stating that nothing effective had been done against the Lurs and only a m few days later I learnt that a force of one hundred and twenty men had been captured by them. 2. There has now been a highly dramatic development in the shape of the kidnapping of Mr. Carroll and another American engineer and the despatch, by return of post as it were, of a ransom of twenty thousand tomans. Mr. Carroll is reputed to enjoy the Shah’s high esteem but apart from this the episode will surely be regarded as an interference in the building of the railway and there fore as a matter of the liveliest possible interest to His Majesty. I shall regard it as of the highest significance if at long last urgent and adequate measures are not taken to pacify Luristan. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 48) and to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz (No. 20).

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 15, dated the 13th January 1933. With reference to my despatch No. 525 of the 12th December last (File No. 1-N.|32) I have the honour to report that the Belgian syndicate has now signed an agreement with the Persian Government to erect a power plant in or near Tehran, in spite of the misgivings expressed by the Belgian Minister. 2. M. Paternotte de la Vaillee, when informing me of this result, said that the Persian Government had manifested the greatest eagerness to conclude the agreement, because it provided for participation in the profits (the first 8 per cent, to go to the syndicate and the next 8 per cent, to the Persian Government). He felt pretty sure, however, that the profits would seldom, if ever, exceed 9 per cent., and his fear was that in a few years’ time the Persian Government Avould advance all the bad arguments which they have used to justify the cancellation of the D’Arcy Concession and demand a radical revision of the Belgian concession ; the Societe de Traction et d’Electricite de Bruxelles did not, however, share his qualms nor did his Government. 3. The commercial secretary learns that the company approached Messrs. Lister’s Belgian agency with a view to the purchase of Lister engines. The manufacturers decided, however, that their engines were not altogether suitable and referred the enquiries to their associated firm, Messrs. Ruston and Hornsby. There is reason to hope, therefore, that a British firm will benefit by this Belgian enterprise. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the Department of Overseas Trade [No. O.T. (B) 7]. (32) (Received on 18th March 1933, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 9, dated 2nd March 1933.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. E.-879|47|34, dated 27th February 1933. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 36, dated the 28th January 1933. I have reported in my despatch No. 34 of the 28th January [Serial No. (5)1 the dithvrambic references to the Shah in speeches pronounced by the Prime Minister*and members of the Majlis at the final session. They go a considerable way in sycophancy, but at least they contain some sense of proportion, in that the usefulness of the “ hand ” to the “ eye ” is recognised. The press, on the other hand, as will be seen from my despatch No. 32 of the 28th January, goes much further, and the sum and substance of the matter, which has no doubt been timefor some time past, but had hitherto been decently veiled, is that nothing has any existence in this country but for the grace of the creative will of the supreme mind, and no man has any personality or authority but by the Imperial inspiration. In fact, the Lord he is God. 2 It appears to me not altogether far-fetched, on the strength of a conversation which I had with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 23rd January, to say that the extravagant tone of the press is a direct reflection of the Shah’s mood to-day. I leave the facts to speak for themselves. I told Feroughi that I understood, though I had not seen a translation of the article, that Seyyid Naficy, the author of a series of artdd 08 about Bahrein which appeared' last summer, had just produced in the Shafaq-i-Surkh a quite outrageous attack on the British race, on the British character and on British characteristics in general. Feroughi had not seen the aiticle, but said that it had been mentioned to him ; Naficy was rather a turbulent fellow and ambitious and wanted to become a Deputy. It was a pity that the press indulged in vulgar abuse and was unable to distinguish between legitimate polemics and mere vituperation. But, of course, His Highness continued without a smile or tremor, there was no censorship, and I must believe that every polemic or abusive aiticle which appeared in the press had not, before its appearance, received the approval of the Government. I conveyed to His Highness quite politely that we had heard all this before and that I had no desire to define the distinction between an absolute control of the press and a censorship. I said, in fact, that I was sure that editors always satisfied themselves that an article would not meet with governmental disapproval. His Highness acquiesced in this negative statement of a positive fact. 3 Feroughi then went on to say that much of the criticism of Persia which was now appearing revealed a deplorable ignorance of conditions m the country. This afforded me the opening which I wanted for alluding to the fork, tooth pick and poker ” article referred to in Sir F. Humphry s telegram No. 6 ot the 12th January, and I suggested that it was so silly as almost to cease to b offensive. Feroughi more or less agreed and proceeded to furnish the rather elusive evidence on which the conclusion I mentioned above is based. He said that it was inevitably most irritating that press articles should attribute to ''evmourtache every manifestation or intensification of political or social levelopment in Persia down to, or up to, the Shah’s social and hygienic education, whereas the Shah had been Prime Minister and had played poker with members of the Diplomatic Corps, including Sir Percy Lorame, long befoie Teymourtache had appeared on the political horizon. 4. I should find it extremely difficult not to write with some measure ot flippancy on this topic. So far as the Shah is concerned, I have n° knowledge of him in the days of his greatness, and I have had no opportunities of appreciating at close quarters the great qualities which he undoubtedly stfll possesses. At the same time, the matter has a most tragic aspect. I &lt; S ^ the Shah has reached the point at which it is impossible ^r any man ot hr t class brain (on oriental standards) to assume or at a of first-class responsibility. I imagine no country m the w0 ™ t ^ moment of crisis quite so abundant a crop of daily rumours as^Persia, but told by persons who have followed events with caie that it is . ,,, was a L noAometkirig behind every one of them. The atest rumour « « similar one at the time of Prince Firuz’s downfall in 19 29 ) is tha the ft ^ reached the conviction that he can trust nobody ; that as Shah, he can ^ through an intermediary ; that, as he can tiust nobody, . • te un til favour of his son, to whom he would act as Regent and Prime . , | )e such time as the boy could stand on his feet ; finally—and this wou , ^ , a master stroke-that he would make over to the nation the vuist propert which, in one way or another, had, in recent years, come into his hands. ^ 5 The atmosphere is that of the Old Testament, and if only the a the Book of Kings could have “ Ustened-in ” at the P/^^^Sie to would have had a dramatic story to tell of the failure ^ David- yn charm awav the Imperial madness. Unfortunately, T J p .&gt; m „ &lt;, '” a ^ thfu i David, some of the purely moral factors which made the strength of the 6. To turn to the press campaign, until this moment I of let between privileged to realise the extravagances °? '1 IC V1 18 ’ t British policy- October 1931, when I arrived, and the midd e of November last, Bn^ J wh virtues or vices were bardly mentioned at all except for a ' , ..,, IT( .- rio ndent ot the Anglo-Persian Oil Company report appeared and when a con IwiaBBBBam] 29 the Morning Post referred regretfully to missed opportunities (see my despatches No. 322 of the 15th July, 1932, and No. 362 of the 24th August respectively) (File No. 1-N.J32). On both occasions T indicated my dissatisfaction, and on both occasions the campaign was dropped before it became necessary to consider whether more serious notice should, or should not, be taken of the matter. There seemed to be no doubt that both campaigns were directed by Teymourtache, just as it may be taken for certain that the long series of articles in the Shafaq-i-Surkh on the subject of the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Concession were written by him. It was not certainly first-class stuff, but, if we compare it with specimens of what the Persian journalist produces without Teymourtache to hold his hand, but haunted by fear of the Imperial wrath, there is reason to view the eclipse of Teymourtache with at least intellectual regret. 7. I will conclude by once again referring to the ugly suspiciousness which Teymourtache once discussed with Sir R. Clive (see Sir R. Clive’s despatch No 121 of the 19th March 1930) [Enclosure to Serial No. (26) of File No. 21-N.j 30]. Because there had been a few sympathetic references to his downfall m the British press, Teymourtache was in British pay, and Ansari has been moved from London because he had taken money from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. 8. I should add that I have made no serious attempt to check the present campaign, because, until it is clear how the situation develops at Geneva, it seems imprudent to discourage the Persian press from providing . ? r 16 chastisement of their Government before a League Commission of Conciliation. 9.

What we believed at the time ot signature was that the Council of Ministers had considerable quahnsand wished to deter signature until Teymotirtache returned from Europe so that he might have his full share of responsibility. It is absurd to ask us to believe now that fe\mo 111 .ache telegraphed from Europe that the Shah wished the Treaty to be signed Lastly, it is an undeniable fact that it was Teymourtache who organised and vocalised the dissatisfaction of the trading community with the maimer m which the Soviet Government had implemented the treaty. 10 The charge of treason is at least still to be proved, but it has probably been thought convenient that the world should believe that such a charge would he Mr Irott has happened to meet Shari‘at-zadeh, the lawyer originally selected by leymourtache to defend him. He said, without giving any further ^xplanahon, that he was obliged to resign the task and then went on to state that the whole trial was a farce from beginning to end, the evidence, such as it was manufactured and the result according to orders. The extreme rapidity ot the proceedings, the fact that the trial was held in camera and the brevitV and obscurity of the report published (translation enclosed) all support this view, and so public opinion will feel happier, if it believes that he was a traitor 11. The conclusion appears to me to be that the Shah determined to break 1 eymourtache but that we are no nearer a satisfactory explanation of his decision. Furthermore, if Teymourtache was, or was believed to be engaged, m organising a conspiracy against the throne, it might reasonably have been thought that with the mainspring smashed the tension would have been relaxed but, according to Jelal, “ the times are exceptional 12. Perhaps there is really nothing to explain and nothing more to be said about the internal situation than that the general feeling of uncertainty is induced by the impossibility of knowing who will be the next victim of‘ the Imperial suspicions. 13. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No, 57), to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad‘(No. 24) and to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 41). Enclosure No. 1 to Serial No. (35). The following is Mrs. Bode’s account of what took place when some police came to her house on the night of February 26th|27th looking for the “ Rais-N Railway ”. At about 1-30 in the morning of February 27th some men in plain clothes knocked on the door of her house and the baji (Persian maid) was eventually wakened and went to see what was the matter. The men asked for the “ Rais-i- Railway ”, but were told it was not his house. The baji also told them that Mr. Bode was away, that Mrs. Bode was out and that there was nobody, else in the house except women. After some confabulation the men went away, Mrs. Bode herself returned about 3-00 a.m. having visited some friends after the performance of the play at the Alliance Franchise. Mr. Wilkes and Miss Porter were with her. They were surprised to notice that the whole street was brilliantly lighted and that there were groups of policemen at all the corners. They thought there must have been a burglary. It was only in the morning that they heard about the visit of the plain clothes men. The same evening Mr. Lingeman was passing along the street where the Bodes live, after the play, when his car was stopped by a policeman, who asked him if he knew the house of the “ Rais-i-Railway He asked if the man meant Mr. Carroll, who usually stayed at the Pension Stump. The man apparently did not mean Carroll and eventually Mr. Lingeman gave it up. When Mr. Bode returned a few days later and went to register at the central police station he asked, half in joke, why they had been sending men tohis house. The men in the office smiled at each other and evidently had some private joke about it, but they would not tell him anything. The house now occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Bode is that which was formerlv occupied by Mr. J)uBois on behalf of IJlens. One suggested explanation is that the Persian Government had obtained a warrant for the detention of Mr. DuBois on account of a large sum representing their counter-claim on Ulens. But this does not sound very convincing, as the police must have known that Mr. DuBois left long ago. They can hardly have forgotten the fuss made about his exit visa. Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (35). Interview with Sartip Ayrom, Orqaniser in Chief of Persian Police, dated 18th March 1933. After concluding the business on which I had asked for an appointment, General Ayrom detained me and embarked on a general conversation which very soon he led to Teymourtache. He started by saying that he hated his job which he characterised as ‘ unclean ’ and extremely difficult and unpleasant. Ever since he had been Chief of Police he had always experienced an element of opposition in a certain quarter and that quarter was Teymourtache. Whenever a question arose concerning Russian activities, whether political, economic, or purely concerning police, he found that Teymourtache would endeavour to interfere and prevent the adoption of any steps contrary to the interests of the Russian elements therein. He (Ayrom) when he first came to the post of Police Chief had had very definite orders from His Majesty to watch carefully Bolshevik propaganda and to report direct to him on all matters pertaining thereto. He consequently found it difficult to reconcile Teymourtache’s attitude and behaviour with His Majesty’s orders. He, in the course of time, had grave suspicions that for some reason or other which he still could not understand, Teymourtache was playing the Russian game. He was certain of it at the time of the signature of the Russian Trade Agreement which, he said, Feroughi had objected to sign and which he only signed when Teymourtache informed Feroughi that the Shah had issued express orders for the signature. When T ventured that surely it was within the possihi- lity of Feroughi to convey his reluctance to His Majesty, Ayrom leant towards me and said ‘ He could not ’. Since Teymourtache’s arrest the Shah has been told and has understood the complete one sidedness of that Trade Agreement and in a recent interview with the Council of Ministers he asked why the devil the Trade Agreement was signed if they (the Ministers) were at the time so opposed to it. He was told that it was “ by your orders ”. He exploded and said it was nothing of the sort and he was extremely angry. It then came out that Teymourtache had taken His Majesty’s name in vain. Majesty then ordered that things were to be put right, and they were to sit down and find a way to put things right. Today he had summoned Petrovsky to an interview and the Chief of Police smiled and said he thought it might be stormy. At any rate the Shah would say what he had to say, but unfortunately he did not know much about the matter beyond the fact that it was definitely resulting in great loss to and difficulties for his country. He said Teymourtache’s confinement to domicile and eventual arrest were the direct result of information that had come to light about his financial dealings in the Khevir Khourian Company and other exchange dealings with the National Bank, and his trial was on those charges only, that is, not on political grounds. Since his arrest, however, definite information had come to light of Teymourtache’s “ close political contact with Petrovsky ”, and Teymourtache was lucky to get of so lightly. At the time of Teymourtache’s first fall from favour and confinement ta his house, he was extremely anxious. This anxiety was visibly lessened when lie learnt that the charges preferred against him were concerned with his finaucial dealings, and finally when judgment of three years imprisonment and of 50,QuTomans fine was pronounced he seemed visibly relieved. Ayrom mentioned that Teymourtache owed about 70,000 Tomans but that he (Ayrom) reckoned Teymourtache’s total assets of property, moveable and immoveable, and cash abroad, at about 600,000 Tomans. He made another remarks which I could not quite understand and that was that during the summer when Teymourtache went away by order of the Shah, the Russians made several representations, even official, about him to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and ever since have made several enquiries from him personally about what was happening to Teymourtache. I said we all were interested naturally. He replied “ Yes, but there are different kinds of interest ”. Einhorn had on several occasions tried to get information out of him about Teymourtache. He (Ayrom) referred to Aghabekoff’s memoirs and asked me if I remem bered the passage about Khostaria having paid Teymourtache 50,000 Tomans. Once Ayrom, thinking of this passage, had asked* Teymourtache whether he tliought Aghabekoff’s stories were true. Teymourtache shrugged his shoulders and said he thought the man was only an adventurer and that all his stories were lies. Ayrom said “ oh, surely, not all ; perhaps embroidered ” but Teymourtache then said : Oh, when I was once in Meshed the British Military Attache—(Ayrom forgot the name so I suggested Thompson and he said Yes ! A es ! Ihompson) told me that all Aghabekoff’s stories were imagination or words to that effect. My impressions were that Ayrom, whom I have known well in the past, was not talking for effect. His manner is frank. He showed that he had, at any rate since he occupied his present post, mistrusted Teymourtache, and he is convinced that Teymourtache was a male ficent influence on the Shah and did great harm to Persia, but why he cannot yet understand. T. V. BRENAN. 17th March 1933. Enclosure ‘J to Serial No. (35). Extract from the “ Shafaq-i-Surkh ” of 19th March 1933. The Court held its sitting on the 25th Esfand (March 16th) from 8-30 a.m. Mr. Lutfi Laryani, the President of the Court (First Section) of Criminal Procedure against Government Officials, Mirza Ismail Khan Yekani and Mirza Muhammad Khan Mehr Yar, members, of the Court, Mirza Hassan Khan Muasser, the representative of the Parquet of the Court of Criminal Procedure were present. The Court decided, before entering upon the examination of the case, with the agreement of the Public Prosecutor, that the examination should lie carried out in camera as the case came under the provisions of Article 327 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Messrs.-Teymourtache, Seyed Hashem Khan and Mirza Ahmad Khan Mughbel, his counsel, and two interpreters for translating such documents as. were in foreign languages attended the court. As a part of the case concerned* the claims of private claimants, representatives of the latter were also present in court. The trial lasted till 10 p.m. the same day. On Friday, March 17th, the Court reopened at 8 a.m. and the defence of the lawyers and the last defence of the accused were heard till about 2 p.m. the same day. The Court announced the conclusion of the examination and commenced its consultation, which lasted till 7 p.m. when the Court issued its verdict and read it over in the presence of the afore-mentioned persons. The outline of the verdict is that Teymourtache is condemned to three years solitary imprisonment on account of bribery (ertesha) which imprisonment involves deprivation of all civil rights, and to the restitution of the bribe, apparently valued at Tomans 20,000 but sold for Tomans 8,000. Teymourtache is also condemned to two years correctional imprisonment and the payment of Tomans 38,502 and £1,712, for swindling. 36 (36) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 127, dated the 24th March 1933. I have the honour to report that the official Gazette of the Ministry of Justice No. 1219 9f the 3rd Bahman, 1311 (23rd January, 1933), published six statements Lc333FDshowing th© position of the note circulcition on •Tul} nth, August -fth, September 16th, October 17th, November 16th and December 16th, 1932, respectively. These statements had apparently been embodied in the fiist four lepoits of the Hoard of Supervisors of the Reserve Fund (commonly called the Board of Currency Control) of which the Minister of Finance is President. The texts of these reports are not available, but the fifth report, containing a statement of the position on January loth, 1933, was published in the press on February 13th. I enclose translations of the first six statements and of the fifth report respectively. 2. By the courtesy of my American colleague I am enabled to send you a copy of an interesting memorandum by the Secretary of his Legation, who has made a special study of this subject ; this memorandum draws attention to various points upon which the statements are obscure and unsatisfactory. I have been asked to emphasise the fact that Mr. Smets’ observations should he treated as absolutely confidential, as he migh suffer much harm if it were known that he had made them. 3. The Chief Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia considers that as the wording of the statements is so involved and as no mention is made of the figures representing the assets and liabilities of the National Bank, the statements throw no light whatsoever on the true position. It will therefore be seen that the figures must be accepted with considerable reserve. 4. It seems likely that subsequent reports will continue to be published, and it is just possible thab later on they may be published in French as well as in Persian. I shall transmit them to you as they appear, unless you consider that their unreliability renders this superfluous. 5.

On the 30th Dei, (20th January 1933), therefore, the Fixed Note Reserve which had been preserved under lock with double key, of which one has been held by the tfoam of Supervisors of the Reserve, amounted to a sum exceeding 70 per cent, o total amount of the notes in circulation. 3.

I was recently released and I have with me now the certificate of release issued by the Bolsheviks. I returned to my native land and again was approached on every side by my people with the urgent demand that I should go out for finding a way out of their pressing difficulties. I was given a new power of delegation and this time I entered Khurassan and tried to visit His Majesty’s Consul-General in Meshed but two men came and took my papers arid did not allow me to go and see the officer in question. All my expectations came to nothing and I did not hear any more from those two persons. A white Russian told me in the meantime that it was no good that I should place my people under the sovereignty of the British Government and that before long a proper Government will be constituted inside Russia which could extend protection to us. Another individual from Tashkent told me that a Government Council was to be convened in Turcomanestan with excellent prospects and he dissuaded me of the intention to place myself and my people under the protection of His Majesty’s Government. I have now come to Tehran with the intention of taking a passport which I have not been able yet to get. In the meantime my money was exhausted and against my debts, which I could not pay, I was put into prison for 8 months. I am now out of prison and without money. I am really at my wit’s end why I have not been able to do anything for my miser able people who wait with eager expectation to know the result of my steps.

(Signed and Sealed) SAKHI ISHAN,40 (38) Despatch from His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office London, No. 130, dated the 25th March 1933. I have the honour to report that the Shah opened the ninth Mejliss on the 15th instant at 10 a.m. This ceremony had been fixed for His Majesty’s birthday and the proceedings were, I understand, on a more elaborate scale than usual. It was attended by the Cabinet, e.T-Prime Ministers, a few of the principal Ulema, the Diplomatic Corps, the Under Secretaries of State, certain notables, and a posse—almost a platoon—of the senior officers of the Army In accordance with his established practice, His Majesty read his speech in an halting manner and in a voice so low that none of the Persian scholars in the diplomatic box could understand a word. 2. A translation of the speech is enclosed herewith. So far as internal affairs are concerned it is evident that the Shah is determined to continue the policy of industrialisation which is proving a severe drain on the country's scanty resources. The intention to divide all Crown lands “ among those classes which lack a stable system of living ” was rather a surprise. From recent reports by His Majesty’s Consul at Seistan I have learnt that certain lands in that area (all of which is technically crown property) have been allotted to small cultivators ; and jt has been known for some time past that certain troublesome tribesmen, particularly Lurs, have been forcibly transferred from their ancestral domains and made to live in other parts of Persia : presumably it is proposed in future to settle still more of them on crown lands. The details of the scheme will no doubt be set forth in the legislation which the speech foreshadows. I imagine that the truth of the matter is that the large estates which form the crown domains of Persia are found to bring in very little net revenue ; the expenses of government management being nearly as much as the income. The Government may therefore hope that under private ownership the land taxes which will be collected from the peasant proprietors working on their own land will increase the revenue of the exchequer ; if this proved to be the case, three excellent results would be attained ; large numbers of a popula tion which must be highly dissatisfied would be propitiated, the agricultural wealth of the country would be increased, and, most important of all, the revenue would be augmented. 3. The reference to the oil dispute is satisfactory so far as it goes, the 80 th ere is no expression of a similar hope that the yet more serious difficulty with the Soviet Government “ will terminate in desirable results under equitable arrangements ”. 4. Having delivered his speech, the Shah enquired of the Ulema, who were grouped on his right hand (the err-Prime Ministers being on his left) why the Imam-Jum eh of Khoi wns not present. The plea of ill-health was accepted as adequate and His Majesty withdrew’. 5. So far as the Diplomatic Corps w r as concerned it was a sadly dreary ceremony : v r e were bidden by a Chef de Protocole, who is over zealous and ' e U ioohsh, 1° present ourselves at 9 a.m. Most of us were fairly punctual as ie resident of the Mejliss believed that His Majesty would arrive at 9-30; and so we waited for three quarters of an hour in a chilly waiting room. Even* tuaily an attempt was made to conduct us to our box, but the door which should have given access to it was locked and the key could not be found ; finally the assembled deputies, all neatly dressed in black coats and black pahlevi hats, had le pleasant surprise of seeing us troop across the floor of the house, and shortly afterwards the proceedings began. r an( l the visitors had departed, the house proceeded under the direction of the oldest member (Haji Mirza Hassan Khan Esfandiary) as emporary President and the four youngest members as temporary Secretaries, to elect the real President, Vice-President and Secretaries. His Highness ilnza Hussein Khan Dadgar was re-elected President by a majority of eighty- one votes and Muhammad Hashim Mirza Afshar and' Mirza Mehdi Khan Uadvar (Vossuq-us-Sultaneh) were elected First and Second Vice-Presidents, ihe house then proceeded to divide itself into six committees for the scrutiny 0 .° e l° c f 1 o 11 credentials of the various deputies, and arranged to hold its next mee mg on April 13th, vTien the work of examination xvould be finished. 7. The number of deputies present at the opening ceremony was one hundred ana twenty-three, out of a total of one-hundred and thirty-six. The remaining41 thirteen are still presumably on their way from the provinces. It is an interest ing fact that they were almost all in the last Mejliss, which means that they must have been Teymourtache’s nominees originally. All the deputies were in fact, though not in theory, nominated by the Government : and from the story brought out at the trial of Diba, which incidentally caused no general surprise at all, it may be inferred that the few persons who failed to secure re-election were out-bidden by their rivals. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 61). Enclosure to Serial No. (38). Speech delivered by His Imperial Majesty Reza Shah Pahlevi on the occasion of the state opening of the ninth term of the Mejliss on Esfand 24th. 1311 (15th March 1933). IN THE NAME OF GOD THE EXALTED. We open with the utmost pleasure the Ninth Legislative Term of the National Consultative Assembly. Thanks to God, the general situation in the country is calm and our relations with foreign countries are preserved and established on the basis of sincere friendship and reciprocal respect. Our Government is in duty bound in the meanwhile to safeguard (even) more than heretofore the interests of the country in respect of its foreign policy. • As we have intimated in Our speech opening the Eighth Term, the ameliora tion of economic affairs therein foreshadowed has received attention and laws have been enacted and enforced in view of the need for-the blancing of com mercial dealings. In view of the importance of commerce We have urged Our Government to exert special vigilance in the complete preservation and enforce ment of the said laws. With regard to the advantages of stimulating interest on the part of the Public towards agriculture and the extension of cultivation in the country, it is essential that the Crown lands of the Government in all parts of the country should be divided among those classes which lack a stable system ot living. r Ihe Government should therefore prepare the necessary bills for the realisation of this purpose and have them sanctioned by the Mejliss. It is Our aspiration that the requiremenrs of the country should, as far as possible, be produced in the country and by the people themselves. With reference to the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Concession and the negotiations which are to take place with a view to a new agreement, We hope that the steps of Our Government will terminate in desirable results under equitable arrangements which will embody the safeguarding of the rightful interests of this country. In view of the fact that Persia owns many mines and important natural resources and that Our entire efforts are concentrated upon the progress and greatness of the country, the Government must have recourse to such means as can bring about the utilisation of the said resources for the progress and advancement of the country. As We have already pointed out on the occasions of the opening of previous terms of the Mejliss, the moral purification and the education of the public, the extension and advancement of the sense of patrio tism and respect for duty in the whole community are among the most important aims and 1 purposes, and the reforming, progressive and law- abiding elements will always enjoy Our protection, encouragement and support. We expect that the members of the Ninth Term (of the Mejliss) will always bear in mind the welfare of their fatherland and the progress and advancement of the country and will co-opejjare with the Government in carrying out the aims mentioned above and the enforcement of other necessary reforms. In conclu sion We seek kelp from God the Exalted and pray for success for the representa tives of the nation in their service to the country.

No. 19.] Enclosure 1 to Serial No. (39). British Legation, Tehran. Financial situation of Persian Government on December 20, 1932. No statement of the financial situation of the Persian Government was pub lished during 1932, neither was the Legation able to obtain the usual table showing the Treasury General balances in Tehran and Europe on the one side, and the public debt ‘and floating debt on the other. One should, however, be able to arrive at a pretty accurate idea of the position by collating all available data and working on the basis of the table showing the position on March 21, 1931, as given in paragraph 312 of the 1931 Annual Report. That table ga\e the figure of the total treasury balances as £5.56 million of which £2.47 (222.5 million krans converted at 90) in Tehran while the balance was actually held in sterling in Europe. The hran balances other than the railway fund are not thought to have changed to any appreciable extent. They are too small to be worth worrying about in any case. The railway fund itself then amounted to 18 million tomans and the receipts during the intervening period are believed to have totalled 17 million tomans, the two items together representing 35 million tomans. The unappropriated balance in the railway fund in December 1932, according to information supplied privately by competent government officials, amounted to 74 million tomans so that expenditure in the intervening period must have amounted to 274 million tomans. The kran balances taken as a whole—the term ‘ kran ’ is used throughout, instead of its modern equivalent the ‘ rial ’, to avoid confusion—should on the above basis of calculation have been reduced by 274 million tomans or 275 million krans but part of this deficit has been made good by the Persian Government’s profits on its purchases of gold. The last of the statements published by the National Bank of the notes issued by it, and the cover held against the note issue, revealed the interesting fact that the Government on December 22, possessed 1,235,238.67 miscals ot gold (.975 fine) which at $20,675 to the Troy ounce works out at $3.7 million approximately, or some 113 million krans. The Treasurer General, however, is known to have stated in the strictest confidence that this stock of gold only cost 80 million krans. As the export of gold is prohibited, and smuggling has been rendered difficult, its price on the local market is frequently 10|15 per cent, below the world rate while silver has also depreciated of late, and it was with silver krans from the trust funds that these purchases of gold were effected during the last two years. Tt is not often that the Persian Government have made a good investment and they are to be congratulated on this one. The kran balances on December 20, 1932,« can now be assessed at 222.5 millions (held in March 1931) minus 105 millions (spent on the railway) plus 30 millions (representing the government’s profits, actually unrealized, on their gold purchase) = 147.5 million krans, or £1.46 million at 101.43 Now following the sterling balance held in March 1931, has to be subjected to the manipulations :— Balance in hand—21 March 1031 Credits — (?) 1930, royalty paid after 20th March 1931 (m) 1931, royalty refused by Persian Government but nevertheless credited' to their account in 1932 .. . • £3,088,401 £1,228,000 £307,000 Debits — (?) Balance of 1929-30 armament appropriation .. £348,000 (??) 1931 and 1932, appropriations for purchase of gun- boats • • .. / £780,000 f (Hi) Latest armament vote in 1932-33 budget .. £1,500,000 £4,623,401 £2,628,000 Unappropriated balance .. £1,995,401 say .. £2,000,000 Mote. There is some doubt regarding the exact figure of the naval appropriations, three in all. The total balances on December 20, 1932, if these calculations are correct amounted to £1.46 + £2 million — £3.46 as compared with £5.5 million in March 1931, a fall of just over 37 per cent. 1 nfortunately for the Persian Government their “ gold reserves ”, at the time His Majesty’s Government decided to go off gold (in September 1931) were actually in sterling and the dollar equivalents of the sterling amounts just Quoted viz., $11,504,500 and $26,620,000, show a fall of 56.8 per cent. ' q ’ If one assumes the funded and floating debts of the Persian Government to have remained at the same figure since March 1931, which seems permissible their financial situation on December 20, 1932, works out as follows Kran balances 147.5 million rials at 101 .. Sterling balances .. £1,460.000 Funded debt .. Floating debt 6.6 £1,600,000 million krans £2,000.000 at 101 £66,000 Credit Balance £1,794,000 £3,460,000 £3,460,000 This credit balance of £1,794,000 or $5,965,050 (at 3.325) compares very unfavourably of course witli that of March 1931, amounting to £3,885,000 or $18,803,000 (at 4.84), the reduction in the dollar credit being particularly striking, amounting to over 67 per cent. The fact remains, nevertheless, that the Persian Government can consider themselves fortunate in having maintained so liquid a position in spite of adverse circumstances. There is very little excuse, however, for the extraordinary ex penditure incurred or about to be incurred on armaments, the total amount earmarked for this purpose since March 1929 being £2^ million apart from the naval appropriations. E. R. L. Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (39). British Legation, Tehran. Bailway Finance. The Tehran newspaper “ Konshish ” stated on August 16, 1931, that the sugar and tea monopolv tax, from its inception in May 1928 to 22 March 1931, had brought in 40.276 million tomans whilst the expenditure incurred on the mrailway during that period amounted to 21.925 millions, leaving a surplus of 18 ^millions This computation appears to be confirmed by the table referred o in the foregoing section, showing the balances held by the Treasury on March 22 ,193l! including 18 million tomans in the railway fund. * ’ Receipts during the period March 1931 to December 1932. (21 months) appear to have totalled 17 million tomans, averaging 19 5 million tomans for the two years fending March 22, 1933. On the other hand the unappropriated balance m the railway fund in December 1932 amounted to 7.5 millions If we and 2* millions for the next quarter’s revenue (the expenditure incurred during that quarter V .;,,,, met ou t of the amounts already appropriated) the railway fund at the Snn“ g of the ne xt Persian year should show a credit balance of 10 million tomans, or roughly £1 million. The position on March 22nd' next can therefore be tabulated as follows Total revenue 40.276 + 19.5 (In millions of tomans.) Credit balance 59J7G = Expenditure 59.776 10.000 49.776 59.776 This allows for an expenditure during the two years ending March 22 next of 49 776 million tomans less the 21.925 million tomans spent up to March 1931 or 27 85 million tomans-the rate of exchange having gone heavily against Persia—as compared with revenue estimated at 19.5 million tomans only. Where future construction is concerned the only J 0 /^yfifpires in the possession of the Legation refer to the South. When the Shah told the American engineer in charge to estimate the cost and the time it would take to bring he line through the formidable Luristan range he was furnished with the following figures :— Salchabad-Bahrein (a little South of Khuramahad) 212 Em. Cost 43 million tomans to be expended locally + $6 million to be spent on foreign material = at present rates of exchange roughly 60 million tomans, or £6 million. Tunnelling alone would account for 23 million tomans at 1 million tomans the Em. Time 3 years. The most that can he expected from the sugar and tea monopoly at the present rate of taxation (which includes a gold surcharge of 160 per cent.) * 10 million tomans a year so that the most the Persian Government would have to spend during these three years—if they are.limited to their presen of revenue for railway purposes—is 30 million tomans plus the JU nm ' already in the railway fund on March 1933 or 40 millions m all, equam s The Shah, however, is said on good authority to insist at the moment o completion of the above 212 Em. in two years instead of three, wincii probably add not less than £1 million to the cost of construction while re\t would also decrease by another million pounds. Even if the Persian Government were to abandon construction in tiie Nor i therefore, they would be faced with a deficit of £2 million if they bin • in the South in three years, and of £4 million if built in two years on of the above estimates. Where the North is concerned the Legation is only aware of a five-year pi ^ elaberated by Swedish engineers in January 1932, to extend the line o at a cost of 25130 million tomans, the latter figure then representing £ There is no reason to think that the Shah is likely to be less impatient i .^ re progress in the North than in the South and here again a still larger exp must be incurred if the rate of construction is to be hastened. Assuming that the Shah wishes the two sections to be extended ^ in minimum of time—say three years—we must allow for an expendi u^ ^ ree million at the very least whereas the total amount available during 1 years, as has already been seen, can hardly amount to more than £4 m45 The additional revenue that can be collected locally for railway purposes, in the present state of commercial stagnancy, cannot affect the financial aspect of the railway issue to any appreciable extent. Even the appropriation for the railway of what is left in the oil royalty account, estimated at £2 million, ^ 'plus the revenue to accrue under this head during the next three years, cannot fill the gap of £8 million. It looks, to sum up, as if two courses were open to the Shah :— (&gt;') To consent to a 6|8 year programme, in which case the sugar and tea monopoly tax plus the oil royalties would possibly provide sufficient revenue to cover the. cost of construction from Salehabad north wards to Khuramabad or even farther, and from Aliabad south wards to Tehran, or (ii) Raise a loan, presumably secured on the oil royalty—in which case much will depend on the upshot of the negotiations for the revision of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concession—if the Shah’s determination to finish the railway, and finish it quickly, can over come his rooted objection to a foreign loan policy. E. R. L.,—7-3-33. (40) Despatch feom His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 122, dated the 23rd March 1933. T have the honour to inform you that I have recently been approached by the Council of Armenian Churches in Tehran with an appeal for assistance in the restoration of the Church of St. Bartholomew. This Church, the oldest in the capital, was for many years the only place -of worship available for the European community, as well as the only place available for the burial of persons of the Christian religion. 2. Among the British subjects buried in the Church itself or in the court yard the best known are Mr. Charles Scott, a son of Sir Walter Scott, who died in 1841 while attached to Her Majesty’s Legation ; Mr. Clen, an early Missionary and the translator of the Bible into Persian, who died in 1849 ; Major-General Sir Henry Lindsay Bethune, Baronet, of Kilconquar, Fifeshire, at one time Commander-in-Chief of the Persian army, who died in 1851 ;• and Mr. Charles Alison, Her Majesty’s Minister, who died in 1872, aged 61. There are also numerous graves of persons of other nationalities, including those of the Russian ^Minister and his staff, to the number of thirty-five persons, who were murdered by the mob in 1829. The Lieutenant-Colonel Murdoch Smith whose children’s names appear with such tragic frequency was later the Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. 3. The Legation has always taken an interest in the Church and I am told that at one time the Minister of the day used to visit it regularly about once a year and make an annual donation towards its upkeep. On the present occasion I and some members of my staff have been glad to subscribe a small sum towards the repairs that have now become essential, and I have also brought the position of the Church to the notice of the Church Missionary Society who are interested in it as the burial place of Doctor Glen, one of the pioneers of their work in Persia. But there are no other British institutions to whom I feel it would be fair to appeal. The Indo-European Telegraph Department, had they been here, might have subscribed, as some former members of the service are buried in the Church, but both the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Anglo- Persian Oil Company were established after the Church had ceased to be the recognised place of burial. 4. The repairs which, the Council declare to be necessary, and which so far as I have been able to judge by a personal inspection seem reasonable, amount to about three hundred pounds. The Council do not expect to get all this or even a large part from foreigners, for the Armenian community of Tehran contains some rich men, but they would undoubtedly appreciate a contribution towards the work. 5. My object in addressing you is not to ask for any contribution from public funds (unless there is some special source of supply for expenditure on histori cal objects of this kind), but to enquire whether there is any societv established with the object of collecting funds for such purposes or likely to be interested Lc333FD46 in the preseht appeal, and whether you would feel disposed to approach the present members of the Scott, Lindsay and Bethnne and Alison famihes, with a view to securing some contribution, however small. ^ is connexion X may mention that the estimates piepaied by the _ Council include a sum of nine pounds for the repair of the tomb of Mr, Alison, “ „ souare stone structure, about five feet high, that stands in the entrance lobbv An^enquirv was received here in 1925 from Mr F. 0.

With reference to my despatch No. 105 of March 11th [Serial No. (30)], reporting the kidnapping by Lurs of Mr. Carroll, the American engineer in charge of the southern railway, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, copies of two despatches from His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz giving lull details rkf nppnrvmiee ‘2. You will observe that the ransom of twenty thousand Tomans, which was not needed in the end, was provided by Mrs. Carroll, and that the section ot Lurs responsible for the outrage were distinct from that which has been giving most of the recent trouble. The Persian authorities appear to have acted energetically and intelligently. * 3. I have given a copy of the first despatch, but not of the second, to my American colleague. The Persian Government, I may say, did not choose to tell him that the kidnapping had taken place and, when he took the initiative aim asked for particulars, were singularly uncommunicative. Mr. Hart said at the time that though he and Mr. Carroll were on good terms personally, he was quite sure that the American engineers generally would not inform him ot the occurrence if they could possibly help it. He ascribed this to the fact that the American Legation, owing to their preoccupation with the affairs of the Hen Company, was bound to adopt an attitude at variance with the personal interests of the American engineers : the latter knew this and were unwilling to admit to anvthing that suggested that the construction of the railway was not the simple task they pretended. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 66), to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 27) and to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz (No. 22). Enclosure No. 1 to Serial No. (42). Despatch from H. M.’s Consul, Ahwaz, to H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, dated the 16th March 1933. With reference to my telegram No. 4 of March 8, reporting the capture by brigands of the Director General of the South Persian Railways and to &gt;oiu telegrajji No. 6 of the 10th instant (not received), I have the honour to subim the following account of the occurrence. 2. On March. 7 Mr. Carroll accompanied by Mr. Irian, an American engineei, and by his personal servant and a motor driver, was on one of his periodical tours of inspection at the northern end of the railway line. He was returning towau s two o’clock in the afternoon by the road which has been constructed along'-si e the recently finished railway embankment between the Dam Dam mountain an Salehabad. At a point about twenty-four miles north of the latter place t ey were fired upon by a party of Lurs some twelve in number who stopped the ca and demanded the money-box, under the impression that they had caught _ paymaster. The windscreen was broken but none of the party was hit. ^ some parley, during which Mr. Carroll at the outset apparently almost P er . sua j his assailants to let him go, the party was marched awav into the mountains a arrived by successive stages at a point some twenty miles off from the scent their capture. From there the driver was sent back with proposals for a rans of two hundred thousand rials.■jmnunnu'wmi ■ ill i | i i | iiii j 51 3. Though this part of the country is desolate and known to be liable to the attentions of marauding tribesmen it has apparently not been the custom of the engineers on construction work to take an escort. Thitherto there had been no interference with their movements, though a railway camp was attacked not very long ago and a Persian merchant was carried off and a contractor seriously wounded. The Khoremabad road, where there are gendarmerie posts, diverges from the railway to the north of Salehabad, and runs roughly parallel through the Dam Dam district at a distance of about ten miles from the track of the railway. Telephone communication, however, exists with Salehabad and Ahwaz. 4. Mr. Carroll's wife was awaiting her husband at Salehabad, where the Bailway Administration now has its own bungalows. She raised the alarm when he had not returned by midnight and a search party was sent out. At 4-0 a.m. news was received that the wrecked car had been found. The railway authorities in Ahwaz were at once advised and several members of the Persian staff and American engineers went up to Salehabad in the early morning, while the military and civil authorities were roused and informed. The Governor General was laid up at the time with influenza. The troops at Dizful were instructed to stand by and instructions were sought from Tehran by the Officer-in-Command of the troops in Luristan, who in the meanwhile despatched two hundred cavalry to the neighbourhood. The Sepah P»ud who was at Pul-i-Zal at the time negotiat ing with Yadullah Khan was also notified. 5. For twenty-four hours there was no news of the captives nor of the direction taken by their captors, until the driver returned with a demand for ransom accompanied by the Persian merchant referred to previously and a Lur, who gave himself up to the military authorities. Mrs. Carroll, apparently on her own initiative, made immediate arrangements to give a personal guarantee for the sum demanded, and the money was obtained in silver from the National % Bank of Persia at Dizful. Sacks containing two rial pieces to the value of two hundred thousand rials were loaded on two cars which left in charge of a senior member of the American staff along with all the available donkeys of the district. The money was taken a considerable distance up into the mountains under military escort until met by a second messenger bearing further proposals from the Lurs. b. Meanwhile the Sepah Bud had received the plainest, instructions from Tehran holding him personally responsible for the safety and rescue of Mr. Carroll and he proceeded to Salehabad with more troops and advanced towards Dam Dam. The Governor General also found it prudent to leave his bed of sickness and go to Salehabad to await events. 7. The second message from the Lurs intimated that no ransom would be demanded but that, as the price of Mr. Carroll’s release, their own security must be guaranteed by the Central Government. Certain members of the tribe must be given employment on the Persian Railway, and lands must be distributed for cultivation. The messenger also bore a private note from Mr. Carroll urging that the troops should be called off, as, otherwise, his life was certainly in danger. 8. Mrs. Carroll, on seeing this note, sent a personal telegram to the Shah begging him to stop the advance of the troops. His Majesty replied most courteously expressing sympathy and stating that her husband’s desires would be complied with. Apparently the necessary instructions were-given, and the Lurs kept their word, for Mr. Carroll and Mr. Irian, together with their servant and accompanied by their captors and several local Khans returned to Salehabad on the evening of March 11, the Sepah Bud having given a written undertaking that this tribe would not be molested and that their claims would be considered. Mr. Carroll also promised to support their request. Before they set out on the return journey the Lurs handed back their watches and rings to the Americans. On arrival_at Salehabad the tribesmen were deprived of their rifles and were then allowed to return to Dam Dam. 9. While in Salehabad the Khans requested the Sepah Bud to exercise similar clemency towards certain womenfolk and relatives of Yadullah Khan whom he at present holds in his hands. It is stated here that the tribe which captured Mr. Carroll is entirely unconnected with the operations of Yadullah Khan and that the event was quite fortuitous and unpremeditated. 10. Apart from the fatigue consequent on long forced marches over exceed ingly rough country, Mr. Carroll appears to be none the worse for his experience. He was treated with consideration by his captors who gave him such food as they52 were able to obtain. I am told that this is his third experience of capture by brigands. 11. It seems probable that a sufficient display of force was made on this occasion to deter the tribes ill the neighbourhood of the railway from any attempt at repeating such attacks. But despite the continued statements in the Tehran ^ press and elsewhere it can hardly be claimed yet that complete security reigns r throughout the length and breadth of the land. No recent reports have been received of any hold up on the Khoremabad road, but the pillaging of villages continues. 12. The reports of floods and a bad washout on the railway to which reference is made in your telegram No. (j of 10th March 1933 (not received) refer to events which happened several weeks before the capture of Mr. Carroll. The damage caused then was repaired immediately, as reported in paragraph 19 of the diary for January 1933. Enclosure No. 2 to Serial No. (42). Despatch from H. M.’s Consul, Ahwaz, to H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, No. 9, DATED THE 16TH MARCH 1933. With reference to my despatch No. 8 of to-day’s date (Enclosure 1), regard ing the capture of Mr. Carroll, it may be of interest to place on record that no request was made to me by the Americans to take any action in this matter. 1 am now told that no attempt was made to communicate with the American Lega tion and that, as soon as touch was established with Mr. Carroll himself, one of his first desires was that no such communication should be made unless the Persian authorities chose to inform the Minister in Tehran. • 2. Mr. Carroll and other members of the American staff of the railway express satisfaction with the prompt action of the authorities and the good sense of the military command which fell in with the request to withdraw at a time when failure to do so might have had unpleasant consequences. (43) Despatch from H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 183, DATED THE 22ND APRIL 1933. With reference to my despatch No. 178 of the 19th April (not received), respecting the attitude adopted by the Persian Government towards my requests for permission to be accorded for a member of this Legation to visit Mr. Town- s bend-Smith in prison, I have the honour to enclose a copy of a memorandum prepared in this Legation summarising the circumstances in which the assurances known as the Safeguards came to be given, and the development of the question since 1928. A subsidiary memorandum deals with the specific question of “ Safe guard ” No. 7 (visits to arrested persons). 2. I venture to request that I may receive instructions as to the line which I should adopt in future discussions with the Persian Government. While I told the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday that I did not suggest that the Persian police methods were similar to those of 'the 0. G. P. U., it would not greatly surprise me if in a few months time I told him that I had changed my mind. The combination of a spineless Government and a violent Shah is one under which the police is likely to wax fat and kick. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 79). Enclosure 1 to Serial No. (43). Memorandum. ■ The recent arrest of Mr. Townshend-Smith, following upon the search of his house, and the efforts recently made during a period of ten days to obtain permis sion lor a member of the Legation to visit him in prison, make it desirable to consider exactly what the so-called “ Safeguards ” are. T he files of the years 1928 and 1929, though voluminous and eloquent on points of detail, give no clear indication of the precise status that the F oreign Office and His Majesty’s Legation considered these “ Safeguards ” to possess and the views they held both in May, 1928, and later have more or less to be inferred.53 n , th 1 F i 1 , reign °. ffice ne ' -er had any liope of withstanding the un lateidl canceilation by the Persian Goverument. of the eapitula,tory otiviloges previously enjoyed by certain foreigners, but destined to end, bv the terms of the tf f/lT 11 ’- 011 A f' l 0 ! 1 ’ 192f {- Al1 they hoped to obtain may be summed up m the following extract trom a letter written by Sir Robert Clive to the Minister ot Court on January 18th, 1928, enclosing a text which later, with manv moditioa- lions, became the Persian Government letter of May 10th : “ - M y Government do not question the decision, while svmpafhis- mg with the desire, of the Persian Government to get rid of the so-called Capitulations. At the same time my Government feel that it is in our mutual interest that possible causes of friction should be avoided. I hope therefore Your Excellency will'be good enough to study in a friendly spirit the aide-memoire which I enclose in this letter setting forth m connection with the new judicial organisation certain matters which my Government are convinced will contribute to maintain among the British trading community in Persia tha+ eoniidence which is so desirable in the interests of both countries. Considering the difficulties of the situation, the fact that any assurances at all were eventually obtained was a great achievement. 1 evmourtache replied in a memorandum (which formed an enclosure to a lettei on various matters, dated March 14th, 1928), to the following effect “ The suppression of the Capitulations is simply due to their being opposed to the principles of the sovereignty and integrity of Persia on the point of principle there is no connexion whatever between the abrogation of the system in question and the reforms in the judicial organisations of Persia or giving anv previous guarantees to the foreign nationals residing in Persia The improve ments m the judicial system .are aimed at safeguarding the comfort and convenience of the Persians themselves and in no wav m order to obtain consent to the abrogation of the Capitulations.” ‘ The memorandum then went on to discuss in detail the measures of reform that the 1 ersian Government had adopted or would adopt and which would apolv equally to foreigners and Persians. } After some further discussions Teymourtache wrote on April 19th : “ 1 &gt; ou a draft ()f a no te that the Government, at the moment of signature of an Accord Provisoire, would consent to send you.” Tliis was the draft of the note eventually signed, with modifications, on May In his telegram No. 116 of April 27th to the Foreign Office, Sir Robert Clive said i — ” This letter (the draft note) will be more or less charter of foreign rights in Persia pending conclusion of treaties.” Nothing more seems to have been said on the general principle until the actual signature on May 10th of the Persian note embodying the judicial measures applicable to British subjects after that date. The terms in which this note opens are worth noting :— 1 “ En reponse aux demandes adressees et an mbment de (I’abolition) des Capitulations, le Gouvernement Imperial, an'mes du deeir de diss per les inquietudes vous adresse, pour que ^ ous e i puissiez transmet- tre la teneur a vos ressortissante, la presente decision. II est inutile de vous dire que le Gouvenement lui-meme... .a accompli des reformes ties appreciables quant an personnel et aux lois judiciaires. Quant a la situation des ressortissants britanniques en Perse decoulant des • prescriptions des lois persanes, les dispositions suivantes prises par le Gouvernement persan lour seront appliquees a dater du 10 mai 1928.” The British reply of the same date stated: — mon Gouvernement a donne une consideration sympathetique aux desirs exprimes par le Gouvernement Imperial pour la resilia- tion des privileges capitulaires Je prends acte des mesures judiciares... .dans votre lettre do 10 mai et vous informe que mon Gouvernement compte absolument sur le fait qua le Gouvernement Imperial assurera sous le nouveau regime complete adequate protection aux resortissants britanniques Lc333FDThe terms of this note were presumably agreed upon beforehand with the Persian Government, but there is no record ol any discussion. It may be noted here, both with respect to the correspondence summarised •ibove and that summarised below, that the two notes of May 10th, 1928 (there was a third but it is not relevant), seem to be the only official correspondence that ^ ever passed on the subject. In view of the attitude that the Persian Govern ment have themselves taken up with regard to acts performed by Teymourtache before his dismissal, as well as on more general grounds, it might be possible to maintain that the intentions of the two parties must be judged by these notes alone, and that expressions of opinion in incidental, private correspondence carry no weight. On May 14th, 1928, the Secretary of State announced in the House of Commons :— “ The Persian Government have addressed to His Majesty’s Minister a list of safeguards that they are prepared to extend to British nationals in Persia These safeguards are in complete accordance with the relevant provisions of Persian law as recently amended. ’ ’ During the remainder of the year 1928, His Majesty’s Legation made constant efforts to induce the Persian Government to bring these measures to the notice of provincial authorities. They were not entirely successful, hut in some cases local Governors received instructions almost textually identical with the note of May 10th, which is sufficient for any consideration of general principles. The instructions usually referred, not to British subjects, but to foreign nationals at large. The reason for this was that the Persian Government had addressed notes similar to that addressed on May 10th to Sir Robert Clive to the German, American and other Ministers. The other Ministers do not, however, seem to have sent replies, or at any rate not to have published these replies in such a form that they could, in default of a disclaimer by the Persian Government, he taken to constitute an exchange of notes in the technical sense of the phrase. The question next cropped up in connexion with the Commercial Treaty negotiations of 1929. In his despatch No. 127 of March 2nd, 1929, Sir Robert Clive reported “ 5. Thirdly, I should refer to the article dealing with safeguards. As I expected His Highness (i.e., Teymourtache), demurred to its inclu sion in a bilateral treaty. He then assured me that this question had been carefully considered by the Persian Government and that steps had already been taken to include, either in the Codes or by legislation or in administrative regulations, all the points in the safe guards which had not yet been incorporated in Persian law. If this is really so, it would appear to me to be the best possible solution of the difficulty. The point had evidently been raised before by the Germans, who have accepted this solution, no mention of the safe guards being made in their treaties.” The Foreign Office asked in reply for a report as to how far the safeguards had been incorporated in Persian laws and regulations and Mr. Parr accordingly wrote on April 13th to Monsieur Hesse, Legal Adviser to the Persian Govern ment :— “ On nous demande .... de Londres jusqu'a quel point les mesures judiciares ont ete incorporees dans les lois et reglements persans. (je vous prie).... de nous faire evoir exactement point par point comment cette question serait reglee. II est certain que note Gouvernement voudra en etre informe d’une maniere detaillee avant de proceder a Pexamen du projet du traite”. Monsieur Hesse replied in considerable detail on April 16th, hut as certain points were not dealt with fully, Sir Robert Clive wrote to Teymourtache o April 23rd asking him by what Persian regulations or laws certain points m note of May 10th were covered, as well as for more precise information on cer aquestions. Teymourtache replied on May 11th giving the information desired and adding at the end of his letter :— “ II reste, toutefois, entendu que les dispositions sus-mentionnees ansi que celles de la declaration du Gouvernement Persan en date du 10 mai 1928 resultant des lois persanes, ne pouventpas etre considerees comme, un engagement du Gouvernement Imperial. Par conse quent, la validite desdites dispositions depend exclusivement de 1’existence des lois dont elles decoulent ”. In reporting to the Foreign Office, Sir Robert Clive expressed the opinion that the reply of Teymourtache on the points that were not clear “ may be said to be satisfactory ”, but did not allude specifically to the last paragraph. The Foreign Office took note of this opinion. On November 7th, 1929, the Persian press published a Persian text of the safeguards with the following introduction :— “ The regulations relating to the status of foreign subjects in Persia have been communicated by the Ministry of Justice in a circular memo randum to all Government representatives and tribunals with a request to put them into force. The following provisions apply to British subjects.” The text was, with unimportant exceptions, the same as that of the eighteen articles of the note of Mhy 10th, 1928. On November 8th, a similar text of provisions applicable to Soviet nationals was published. The most important difference was the omission of any reference to domiciliary visits. On November 10th a third text of provisions applicable to foreign subjects as a whole was published. It was practically the same as the British text. After that nothing much happened until the arrest, late in 1932, of a German dentist, named Dr. Schreinert. The German Legation had great difficulty in getting permission for one of their member to visit him and the whole question of the validity of the safeguards arose. In discussing this question with the Secretary of the American Legation, the head of the European and American Section, stated that in the view of the Persian Government the safeguards were a unilateral undertaking intended to cover a transitional situation : and that this situation no longer existed, as the bases on which it rested had been supplanted by the body of treaties and agree ments since concluded by Persia with other countries, by the subsequent comple tion of the then imperfect Persian judiciary and Codes of domestic law and administrative measures. The Counsellor of the German Legation thought that their case was not very strong because they had signed a permanent treaty with Persia covering question of commerce and residence. In a recent note to this Legation, however, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that certain action had been taken “ in compliance with Article 6 of the Circular of May 1928 ”, this phrase being repeated verbatim from a report addressed to the Ministry by the Chief of Police. On the other hand, the Head of the English section-has stated orally that there can be nothing in the Safe guards incompatible with Persian law and that in case of conflict laws made subsequently over ride them. The view of the American Government, as understood by their Legation here, is the same as that held by them in 1929. It is that :— “ The Declaration of Safeguards is regarded by the American Government as a voluntary commitment assumed by the Persian Government regarding the treatment guaranteed to foreigners after May 10, 1926, and as a definite pronouncement of policy that would be pur sued by succeeding Governments in Persia without alteration or time limit.” From all these quotations the view of the Persian Government is pretty clear. It is, and always has been, that the safeguards were simply a statement of what was, or would shortly become, Persian law, and constituted no sort of engagement whatever. The view of His Majesty’s Government is not quite so clear. In theory it * probably approximated to that of the American Government, but in practice HisMajesty^ Legation have on more than one occasion appealed to the safeguards as sometnmg by which the Persian Government were bound, and so far they have received no formal denial. The question is whether, having regard to the fact that all official corres pondence on the subject of these safeguards in 1928 was confined to the notes exchanged on May lOth, 1928, which were signed and published—by us—at the same time as a number of formal instruments, these notes can be regarded as an exchange of notes ” and consequently as an international engagement binding upon the Persian Government. As an international engagement its provisions could be held to over-ride any Persian law or regulation which conflicted with them. It might be possible to put up a case on these lines, but unfortunately, even if it could be proved, the individual safeguards are so worded that in almost every case the Persians can avoid compliance with the spirit of the article by appealing to some provision of their own law or regulations. 1 attach a special note on the point in the safeguards that concerns us most at the moment : visits by Consuls to persons under detention. Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (43). Note on Safeguard No. 7. Article 7 of the Persian note of May 10th, 1928, reads as follows :— “ Les ressortissants britanniqnes arrotes et mis en prison auront le droit, conformement aux reglemcnts des prisons, de communiquer avecleurs consuls les plus proches, et les consuls or leurs representants auront,, en se conformant anx reglements des prisons, la permission de les visiter. Les autorites gouvernementales transmettront de suite a ' Padresse telles demandes de communiquer avec aux. ,, In April 1929 the Foreign Office enquired to what extent the safeguards had been embodied in Persian laws and regulations and Monsieur Hesse, the legal adviser to the Persian Government, wrote to Mr. Parr on April 19th in reply to a request for detailed information :— “ No. 7.—La communication des prisonniers avec le dehors est reglee par le Reglement des Prisons, Chapitre TV, Article 16 et suivants. L’Article 15 dudit chapitre regie la visite des prisonniers.” It may be noted here that the Articles of the Prison Regulations in force in April 1929, and still apparently in force, which really seem to govern the question of visits to persons under arrest are Nos. 17, 18 and 19 of Chapter IV ; these provide respectively that permission must be given by the Juge d’Instruction in charge of the case, or in serious cases by the Proeureur Imperial or Procureur General, that the Juge d’Instruction or Procureurs may refuse permission for a visit if they consider a visit “ contraire a la bonne marche de 1’instruction , although aussitot les debats commences ” the defending counsel must have free access to the accused person, and that when a visit takes place the warder, whose presence is necessary, may stop the visit if there is any whispering or anything to suggest that its object is to “ entraver le cours de 1’instruction . There were several points in Monsieur Hesse’s letter which were not entirely clear or satisfactory and on these Sir Robert Clive sought further information from Teymourtache, to whom he wrote on April 23rd, 1929 :— “ En ce qui coneerne le No. 7, la reglementation des prisons admet des visitcs aux incarceres, mais ne parait pas permettre daue tous les cas Pacces du Consul.” To this Teymourtache replied on May 11th, 1929 :—• “ En ce qui concerne le No. 7. il est vrai quo le reglement des prisons ne prevail pas expressement le cas, mais il est evident que le servic penitentiaire fera toutcs les facilites pour que les Consuls et ranger puissent, le cas echeant, avoir acces a leurs nationaux detenus on arretes.” In reporting this repty to the Foreign Office, Sir Robert Clive expressed ^ opinion that it, and the replies on the other points, might be said to satisfactory. In the case of the arrest of Dr. Sehreinert at the end of 1932, al ( 1( L m S recently in the ease of the arrest of Mr. Townshend-Smith in April, 193^ ^ attitude of the Persian Government has been that Safeguard No. ( g' ne:557 Consul no greater privileges than anyone else and that his visit, like that of everyone else, most be subject to the permission of the Juge d’Instruction, which will not ordinarily be given, on the analogy of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, until the “ Instruction ” is finished. In support of this in the case of the arrest of Mr. Townshend-Smith, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Justice quote Article 120 of the Prison Regu lations, but neither they nor any other Persian authority has yet been able to produce the text of these Regulations. The Prison Regulations referred to above have 38 articles only. The interpretation of the article therefore turns on the sense to be attached to the phrase “ vonformement (or en se conformant) aux reglements des prisons ”. The sense which we may assume the British drafters gave to it was one that did not interfere with the spirit of the article, that is to say that it referred not to any special code of regulations, but to regulations, in Ihe most general sense of the term, governing the manner in which the visit was to take place after per mission harf been given : for instance, the visit would have to take place between certain hours, a warder would have to be present, there would have to be no whispering and no passing of letters or other objects, etc. The spirit of the article, in this view, was that the Consul had a right of unconditional access to the accused person. The Persian Government have however taken the line that the phrase refers to the code of regulations in force for the time being, and to this view we have subscribed to some extent by the exchange of private letters with Monsieur Hesse and Teymonrtache quoted above. But it does not necessarily follow that we have admitted that the phrase can apply to any part of the code of regulations that is repugnant to the inten tion of the Article. We might maintain that the words “ auront la permission ” over-ride any limitation that the “ reglement des prisons ” may purport to place upon the time at which the “ permission ” is to be given : in other words, that the visit must take place whenever the Consul wants to pay it, and that only then can the “ reglement des prisons ” take effect, to the extent that the visit must take place in the company of a warder and so forth. The change of the word “ conformement ” into “ en se conformant ” when applied to the Consuls if anything bears this out. ’But of course this view can only be upheld if we can uphold the more general view that the safeguards are an international engagement binding upon the Persian Government (see general memorandum), and that in consequence its provisions over-ride any Persian law or regulations which conflicts with them.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 55-A., dated the 11th February 1933. In a recent despatch I had the honour to report the issue of instructions by the Shah forbidding Persians to frequent foreign Legations. The fact that officials of the Ministry' for Foreign Affairs denied the story is, of course, of no importance whatever ; their denial was only half-heaited, and since my last despatch on the subject I have received overwhelming confirmation from many sources that such an order was given. The following facts give the first direct instance which has come to my notice of a definite punishment meted out to a Persian who ventured to transgress the Royal command :— 2. On the 14th January Mukhbir-ed-Dowleh, a pensioned official of the Ministry of the Interior, called at his own request on Mr. Trott. He is a nephew of the present Prime Minister and a son of the late Mukhbir-ed-Dowleh, k.C.I.L. ; ins family have been for many years on terms of close friendship with members ot this Legation. The present Mukhbir-ed-Dowleh is rather an insignificant individual : a passion for opium and the reputation of being of limited intelli gence combined with accusations of irregularities when he was Governor ot lultanabad some five vears ago, have resulted in his being unemployed for some time • and being aged nearlv 60 lie has been drawing his pension of 160 tomans per month in Tehran without really expecting ever to get another appointment.60 3 The eist of his conversation was to the effect that the 1 ersian Government had made a grave error in cancelling the D.’Arcy Concession He gave .certain details which I had not heard before—including a story that oOO troops were sent off to the south on the day that the cancellation of the concession was announced, wdth o dei to tSke over the oil-fields, but that directly the first British reply was received orders were issued instructing the commander of the troops that they were to protect the oil-fields instead of seizing them. He stated his opinion that Tevmourtache could easily have put through a subservient Majlis the agreement which he came to with the Anglo-Persian Od Company in London a the begm- ning of 1932, and that he ought to have done so. In fact, he laid all the blame f , the present unfortunate state of affairs with the former Minister of Court, saying that he could have prevented the Shah from cancelling the concession, had he wished to do so. 4 Whatever the truth of his stories or the value of his opinions, the immediate point I wish to make is that a fortnight after this visit Mr. Trott received a message from Mukhbir-ed-Dowleh saying that he had been severely reproved by his uncle for visiting the British Legation ; His Highness said that the Shah was furious that his wishes had been disregarded, and as a penalty M«khbir-ed-l&gt;owleh would have to go off at once to the post of Governor c* 1&gt; m.dvin with a salary of 90 tomans a month. Mukhbir-ed-Dowleh defended himself bv savins’ that he had been friendly with the British Legation, as every- h Iv knew for very many years ; and as an official on pension, with no employ- e ft he had no idea that there could be any objection to his visiting his friends. And the idea of going to Damghan in winter, the salaiy of the post not being much more than hall his pension, was clearly a direct punishment, and he objected strongly to such treatment. The Prime Minister no doubt tried his be o assuage the Royal wrath and evidently succeeded m making things a little hetterfor the unfortunate Mukhbir-ed-Dowleh, for he was appointed Governor of Damghan and Semnan on the 8th January and left tor his post on that date; the emoluments of the two posts being about the same as his previous pension. 5 Mukhbir-ed-Dowleh thus joins the select body of Persians who consider themselves sacrificed for friendship with us. Apart from the Sheikh of Muham- mnrnh tlioro are a number of Persian* now in Tehran who, for one reason or another attribute their fall to their friendship with members of this Legation or to their*too ardent expressions of pro-British sympathies. 6 I mentioned this boycott of foreigners to the Minister for Fore^n Affairs a &lt;jav or two ago. His Highness was recovering from influenza, and as the resn of his indisposition, or perhaps of the fact that the Council ot Minist rs meets three times a week in the presence of the Shah, was more s P lrlt1 ®® 8 usual He, of course, denied that any order had been issued, on t e principle that he declared that the celebrations in connexion with the cancell n of the D’Arcv Concession were not “ by order ’ . (1 resumably, it any d&gt; indiscreet enough to ask why Teymourtache is confined to his house mid police supervision, be would be told that no order had been given for Ins a.rest ftold Feroughi that it was a matter of fact that Persians wdio.for years ^ been on terms of social intimacy with foreigners were now display ng emb&lt; ■ ment if invited, and there was not a shadow of doubt that they were no on their own initiative.

He may also have a suspicion thatjn Western ejes^ drawing-rooms, ne may also nave « sutipienm ’tj,,. a is not ment of Teymourtache looks ugly, and that we may be sayuw s • ' r t#M me altogether a sudden development, as T remember that the 1 ohsh Mn iwl5 Wore he went tl.n &lt;A December that the r «fooBsams 61 with wiiom he used frequently to play bridge at the Iran Club were displaying an increasing reluctance to be at his table. 8. With regard to the Iran Club, which w^is, under the presidency of Teymourtache, the great point of contact between Persian and foreign society, * I understand that tlie {Shah has been consulted and has expressed the wish that its days shall be prolonged and, indeed, that the Sunday afternoon thes dansanis, which lapsed with the eclipse of Teymourtache, shall be revived. His Majesty has so far unbent as to say that the finances of the club should be strengthened by conferring on the cluD a monopoly for the importation of playing cards. 9. Th^ atmosphere in which we are living to-day is rather suggestive of the mad-house (or at least of Mr. Waugh’s Black Mischief), but perhaps it will improve when the Shah and the rest of us have become accustomed to the elimination of Teymourtache, who was from every aspect, good or bad, the central factor in our corporate life.

The figure of 3,500 men, given m paragraph 2 is a much larger number than I had previously imagined the Lur rebels could raise. Lc333FD62 2. It is clear that Yadullah Khan is in a position to do a great deal of damage, but it is at the same time doubtful whether he has the resources neces sary to’organise his somewhat mixed following to the point of being able to withstand the military forces indefinitely. The terms which he is said to have offered to the Government are that he should be Governor of Luristan at a salary of 50,000 rials a month, and that all troops should be withdrawn from the province, no garrison being maintained there in future. In return he would guarantee the inviolability of all traffic passing through the area. 3. Hassanvand, mentioned in paragraph 3 of Mr. Watkinson’s despatch, is the name of a Lur tribe. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch with enclosures to His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah (No. 3), and without enclosures to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz (No. 9). \ Enclosure. From His Majesty r s Coxsul, Ahwaz, No. 3 (Coxfdl.), dated the 17th January 1933. With reference to your telegram No. 51 of the 16th ultimo, regarding the reported preparation of a strong force to deal with the outlaws and rebel tribes in Luristan, and to paragraph 110 of my diary for the month of December, I have the honour to furnish the following report based on information supplied by recent travellers on the Khorremabad road, and by a Lur who is at present in Ahwaz, and whose statements are believed to be reliable. 2. The band of outlaws under Yadullah Khan Kholeh, which has been holding up traffic on the road between Khorremabad and Dizful throughout last year, was estimated, until recently, to number about 1,500 men. They were for the most part Lurs belonging to local tribes. There are now said to be over 3,500 rebels in that part of Luristan, all armed and mostly mounted, including large numbers of conscript deserters and old soldiers from all parts of Persia. They claim to have arms, ammunition and general stores in various depots sufficient to enable them to hold out for a considerable time if attacked. The authorities at Khorremabad and in Dizful appear to have made no attempt to stop the regular purchase of supplies of sugar, tea and piece-goods by emissaries of the outlaws. Large numbers of arms and ammunition have been captured at different times from the troops and stolen from their camps. 3. A certain Ali Murad Khan, of the tribe of Mir Ali Khan in the Hassanvand district, recently joined Yadullah Khan with 250 men. They have sworn a solemn oath to oppose the Central Government bv all possible means and to co-operate with one another in holding up traffic on the Khorremabad road, which has been divided into two sections. Yadullah Khan remains in charge of looting ^operations on the section between Khorremabad and Dizful, and Ali Murad Khan from Khorremabad northwards to Sarawand and the Mala} ar district. I he chieftains exchanged one hundred men as hostages for their mutual good faith. 4. Endeavours have been made unsuccessfully to induce the Arab tribes neai Karkheh and the Papi tribes of Luristan to throw in their lot with the outlaws. Contact has also been established with the Bakhtiari tribes, with a a itv to encouraging them to resist the wishes of Tehran as regards seasonal migrations. There is also a systematic terrorisation of all the tribesmen and townspeople of localities whence supplies are obtained, but looting has been, for the most part, confined to traffic on the main road. Emissaries have also been sent to the Pusht-i-Kuh to establish contact with the rebels of that district. J It Is reported that an officer of the Amnieh, who has for some time been stationed near to Pul-i-Dukhtar, is m league with Yadullah Khan, having been bribed with gifts of carpets. • ’ 6. Up to the present the troops at Khorremabad have made little serious effort to cope with the situation. Only small reinforcements have arrived there so far. Promises of free pardon to Yadullah Khan and other Lur e iieftams, made &gt;\ the Sepah Bud, who recentlv visited the district, have met with insulting replies. I- A military, officer and two soldiers were captured recently and are still Uhl bv the outlaws. Otherwise there has been little interference with private Travellers on the road. But lorries are from time to time stopped and looted,and it is reported that a lorry containing the mail was held up about two weeks ago and part ot the contents was burnt. Three thousand tomans and a quantity oi opium were taken trom the accompanying passengers. 8. In spite ot official assurances little confidence is felt at present by local merchants m tiie safety of the road, the more so as it is felt that troops are not Imely to be spared trom the capital in the present political situation. Officials ot the Impel lal Bank oi 1 ersia and of the Anglo-l J ersian Oil Company how- e\ei, assuie me that the position is no worse at present than it has been durin°’ the past twelve months, the proportion of commercial vehicles stopped bein” estimated at less than one m twenty. It is significant that there has been no increase m iieight lates demanded on the road and no attempt on the part of local drivers to transfer to less dangerous parts of the country while the actual volume of traffic has increased since the railway was declared open to traffic from Ahwaz to Salehabad, and a regular bi-weekly service of trains has been run. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Isfahan (No. 95), and to His Majesty’s Consular Officers at Kermanshah (No. 96) and at Shiraz (No. 97).

His Majesty’s Bepresentative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State of Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit herewith, copies of the documents mentioned in the subjoined Schedule, on the subject of Persian police raid on the house of Mr. W. Townshend-Smith a British subject :— Note from His Majesty’s Minister, to the Persian Affairs, No. 110 of 9th March 1933. Minister for Foreign Enclosure to Serial No. (53). I have received from a British subject, Mr. W. Townshend-Smith, resident m lehran, a letter from which I extract the salient points and desire to direct Your Highness’ most serious attention to the issues raised :— 2. At 6 30 p.m. on February 28th (9th Esfand), Mr. Townshend-Smith, hearing a knock on his front door opened it. Thereupon six men in civilian dress pushed their way into his house, the leader informing him, in reply to a request for an explanation of this intrusion, that he was from the Secret Police (lammet). Mr. Townshend-Smith then asked for his authority to enter his house and was shown a small metal disc attached to the police agent’s belt. He was then informed that he was accused of sending gold out of Persia and that his presence was required at police headquarters whithA he was then escorted. There he was detained until 9 p.m. when four of the police agents, who had remained at his house, arrived bringing with them a large pillow-slip which proved to be full of Mr. Townshend-Smith’s private and business papers ; his old army revolver and cartridges had also been removed. He was then handed a slip of paper on which was written in English : “ someone has told Us you have been purchasing gold and shipping it out of Persia, therefore pm have been brought here ”. After sealing the pillow-slip, as ordered by die police, Mr. Townshend-Smith was allowed to leave and was instructed to return the next day at 9 a.m. When he reached his house he found that it had neen systematically searched. . Mlien he returned the next morning the seal was broken and the papers in (lie pillow-slip were examined till 7-30 p.m., two of a purely private nature icing retained. He was eventually allowed to leave at 8 p.m. but ordered to present himself the next morning. o 4- /Alien he arrived home Mr. Townshend-Smith found that a party of uee detectives had been there and searched the cellars, again without pro- ducmg any warrant.MW — I if il 64 5 On the following day Mr. Townshend-Smith was asked a number of questions, which were written down, with his answers, in Persian. This docu ment he was required to sign though he protested that he could not read Persian. During his absence from iiis house it was \isited by three women detectives, who asked the two women in the house a number of questions. - 6. During the last few days Mr. Townshend-Smith has been more than once summoned to police headquarters. 7. From this recital Your Highness will recognise that the police authori ties appear to have entirely disregarded paragraph 3 of Clause 6 of the note addressed to my predecessor by the Acting .Minister for Foreign Affairs on Mav 10th, 1928. This passage runs as follows :—•“ Ni la maison privee ni la maison de conunerce d’un ressortissant britannique ne sera forcee ou per- quisitionnee sans un mandat provenant de 1’autorite judiciaire competente avec des garanties a determiner ulterieurement contre les abus ” (page 22 of white paper). 1 shall be obliged if Your Highness will cause a careful enquiry to he made with regard to this point and will furnish me with any relevant in formation at an early date. 8. There is another matter of importance. Your Highness will have observed that Mr. Townshend-Smith’s house was twice searched and entered a third time while he was actually being examined at police headquarters. I will not claim to speak wtih authority on the subject of police regulations, but I find it difficult to believe that it is the practice in Persia or any other civilized country, even if the written regulations are silent on the subject, to search a person’s house in his absence in cases where his immediate presence can be secured. 1 have the honour to request that Your Highness will direct the attention of the competent authorities to this point also and will be so good as to inform me of the result. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Highness the assurance of my highest consideration. (54) {Received on 29th April 1933, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 15, dated the 13th April 1933.) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 160, dated the Hth March 1933. The Persian Press during the past fortnight has contained few references to the oil dispute. Sir John Cadman’s departure from London on his way to Tehran has duly been announced ; no definite statement as to the return ol the Persian delegates to Tehran has however been seen in the Press, and rumours have not been lacking that Davar and Ala are too frightened of their reception to return at all. A similar story concerning Ali Quli Khan Ansari was how ever proved to be false by the em-Minister’s return to Tehran at the end ot February, which was duly announced in the Press. 2. The “Jttila’at ” of the 25th and 26th February publishes four columns of translation of a radiq speech broadcast by the Minister of Justice Davar from Geneva at 10 p.m. on Wednesday the 25th January. The discourse lohw the usual lines developed in the Persian memoranda to the League. A 1 torical sketch of recent history of Persia is first given, beginning Do 111 Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907. The various offences of the Anglo-rer Oil Company are set forth on familiar lines. The argument about the rmn^ ships is elaborated ; though no mention is made of the “ legal decision the Majlis approving the cancellation of the concession. 3. The “ Kooshish ” of the 28th February has a front-page article name “ The British Secret Service ”, translated from a Swiss paoer named a^, ently the “ Courier de Vole ” of the 9th February. The object oy tne appears to be to show how omniscient and ubiquitous the Bntisn Service is, and how its agents were successful in manipulating tlie Persian Oil Company concession. 4. The “ Iran ” of the 1st March has a long article from the P el1 ® g ^ e f r, ssor Arthur TJpham Pope, describing in verv complimentary terms . ieS of civilization of ancient Persia.

This expulsion has already begun, and about 100 have been despatched in the last 3 days towards Kashan and Isfahan. (56) (Received on 27th May, with Political Secrtary’s letter No. 19, dated the Uth May 1933.) Despatch from His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London No. 90, datet&gt; the 10th March 1933. His Majesty’s representative presents bis compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith‘copy of a memorandum by the commercial secretary, Tehran, on the financial situation of the Persian Government on the 20th December, 1932 with a note on railway finance. Enclosure 1 Financial Situation of Persian Government on December 20, 1932. No statement of the financial situation of the Persian Government was published during 1932, neither was the Legation able to obtain the usual table showing the I reasury general balances in Tehran and Europe on the one side and the public debt and floating debt on the other. One should, however, be able to arrive at a pretty accurate idea of the position by collating all available data and working on the basis of the table showing the position on the 21st March, 1931, as given in paragraph 312 of the 1931 annual report. That table gave the figure of the total r I reasury balances as £5.56 million, of which £2.47 (222.o million krans converted at 90) in Tehran, while the balance was actually held m sterling in Europe. The bran balances^ other than the railway fund are not thought to have changed to any appreciable extent. They are too small to be worth worrying about m any case. The railway fund itself then amounted to 18 million tomans, and the h coip s during the intervening period are believed to have totalled 17 million omans, the two items together representing 35 million tomans. The unappro- pna ec lalance in the railway fund in December 1932, according to information supplied privately by competent Government officials, amounted to 74 million omans so that expenditure in the intervening period must have amounted to 274 million tomans. The kran balances taken as a whole—the term “ kran ” is used through out instead of its modern equivalent the “ rial.”, to avoid confusion— should ™ 1 e .‘. ^ aSiS calculation have been reduced by 274 million tomans or million krans, but part of this deficit has been made good by the Persian Government s profits on its purchases of gold. • Ah; hy of 1 the statements published by the National Bank of the notes fn fVi ' f A * 11G cover h 0 ld against the note issue, revealed the interesting Gxd that the Government on the 22nd December possessed 1,235,238.67 miscals •vT- 0 ( ('i/ 1110 )’ which at 20.675 dollars to the trov ounce works out at 3.7 million dollars approximately, or some 113 million krans. etirifidmtpo Ii ^f 11C i ra A* ^ owever &gt; m known to have stated in the strictest t,l v ™ , h ?V V s st ‘f k of £0 ld only cost 80 million krans.

Enclosure No. 2. Bailway Finance. The Tehran newspaper Komhiah stated on the 16th August 1931 tw the ‘ 1 oo? r , an , fI tpa f V 0 ’7’ i,R inception in May 1928 to the'22nd March 1. ol, had brought m 40.275 million tomans, whilst the exoendifnrp iTi S ’ dnri ;v. thfit neriod amounted to 21.925 millions leaving asiirphil of 8.35 millions. This computation appears to be confirmed hv the table referred to m fhe foregoiug seet^n, shovung the balances held hv fhn eter ^f (1 22nd March, 1931, including 18 million tomans in the railwav fund 1 ' SlUy ° n t lG68 Receipts during the period March 1931 to December 1932 (twenty-one months) appear to have totalled 17 million tomans, averaging 19.5 million tomans for the two years ending the 22nd March, 1933. On the other hand, the unappropriated balance in the railway fund in December 1932 amounted to 7.5 millions. If we add 2£ millions for the next quarter’s revenue (the expendi- % ture incurred during that quarter being met out of the amounts already ^ appropriated), the railway fund at the beginning of the next Persian year should show a credit balance of 10 million tomans, or roughly £l million. The position on the 22nd March next can therefore be tabulated as follows :—• (In millions of tomans.) Total revenue, 40.276 -f 19.5 59.77G Credit balance .. 10.000 Expenditure .. . 49.776 ^9.776 59.776 This allows for an expenditure during the two years ending the 22nd March next of 49.776 million tomans less the 21.925 million tomans spent up to March 1931, or 27.85 million tomans—the rate of exchange having gone heavily against Persia—as compared with revenue estimated at 19.5 million tomans only. Where future construction is concerned, the only up-to-date figures in the possession of the Legation refer to the south. When the Shah told the American engineer in charge to estimate the cost and the time it would take to bring the line through the formidable Luristan Range, he was furnished with the following figures :— Salehabad—Bahrein (a little south of Khorremabad) : 212 kilom. Costi: 43 million tomans, to be expended locally + 6 million dollars to be spent on foreign material — at present rates of exchange raughly 60 million tomans, or £6 million. Tunnelling alone would account for 23 million tomans at 1 million tomans the kilom. Time : 3 years. 1 he most that can be expected from the sugar and 'tea monopoly at the present rate of taxation (which includes a gold surcharge of 160 per cent.) is 10 million tomans a year, so that the most the Persian Government would have to spend during these three years—if they are limited to their present source of revenue for railway purposes—is 30 million tomans pins the 10 millions already in the railway fund on March 1933, or 40 millions in all, equalling £4 millions. 3 he Shah, however, is said on good authority to insist at the moment on the completion of the above 212 kilom. in two years instead of three, which Avon Id probably add not less than £1 million to the cost of construction, while revenue would also decrease by another million pounds. Even if the Persian Government Avere to abandon construction in the north, therefore, they would be faced Avith a deficit of £2 million if they built 212 kilom. in the south in three years, and of £4 million if built in two years— on the basis of the abo\ T e estimate. A\ here the north is concerned, the Legation is only aAvare of a five-year plan, elaborated by Swedish engineers in January 1932, to extend the line to Teh i an, at a cost of 25 — 30 million tomans, the latter figure then representing £5 million. There is no reason to think that the Shah is likely to be less imnatient regarding progress in the north than in the south, and here again a still larger expenditure must be incurred if the rate of construction is to o e hastened. Assuming that the Shah wishes the tAvo sections to be extended pari pa ssU f mu m mi mum of time—say, throe years— Ave- must alloiv' for an expenditure o million at the A T ery least, whereas the total amount aA 7 aliable during t p ee a cars, as has already been seen, can hardly amount to more than million. The additional roAmnne that can be collected locally for railway purposes, m the present state of commercial stagnanoA 7 , cannot affect the financial aspect r &gt;l the railway issue to any appreciable extent. Ea 7 cii the appropriation forrailway of what is left in the oil royalty account, estimated at £2 million, plus the revenue to accrue under this head during the next three years, cannot fill the gap of £8 million. It looks, to sum up, as if two courses were open to the Shah :— (i) To consent to a six-eight year programme, in which case the sugar and tea monopoly tax plus the oil royalties would possibly provide sufficient revenue to cover the cost of construction from Salehabad northwards to Khorremabad or even further, and from Aliabad southwards to Tehran ; or {ii) Raise a loan, presumably secured on the oil royalty—in which case much will depend on the upshot of the negotiations for the revision of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concession—if the Shah’s determination to finish the railway, and finish it quickly, can overcome his rooted objection to a foreign loan policy.

Oespatch from the Lords Commissioner’s of His Majesty’s Treasury to the Foreign Office, London, No. E.-11259, dated the 2nd May 1933. I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury Sir H. Montgomery’s letter of the 27th ultimo (X-2599|17|503), with enclosure, (not received), proposing the engagement of an additional munshi at His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran. In reply I am to request you to inform the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that in the circumstances represented Their Lordships sanction the engagement of a third munshi at this post at a commencing salary of 800 rials a month rising by increments of 50 rials a month every two years to a maximum salary of 1,000 rials a month, together with the payment of bonus upon the basic salary at the rate of 25 per cent, and of the Noruz gratuity, subject to the acceptance by the Government of India of a moiety of the expenditure involved. The bonus should be regarded as subject to review in the event of a material fall in the cost of living at Tehran as measured in currency. (58) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 227, da,ted the 12th May 1933. As I had the honour to inform you in my telegram No. 98 of May 10th (not received), I called that day upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs and handed to His Highness a further note on the Parsons and Townshend-Smith cases, of which a copy is enclosed herein [cf. also Serial No. (53)]. 2. At my request the Minister of Justice, Mirza All Akbar Khan Davar, was present and I took Mr. Mallet with me. 3. Ferouglii started by reading the Persian version of my note to his colleague in a rather shamefaced manner. Davar at once seized upon the point referred to in paragraph 7 of my note in which I complained that a breach of section 10 (Enclosure 2) of the law supnlementary to the Fundamental Law of 14th Zi Qa’deh, 1324, had occurred, in that Mr. Parsons had not been apprised within twenty-four hours of his arrest of the charges to be brought against him. If it was indeed true, a serious irregularity had occurred. His Excellency endeavoured to excuse himself for the delays of which I proceeded to complain by saving how busy he had been over the Anglo-Persian Oil Company conces sion, but undertook immediatelv to look into the whole case most carefully. I then took the opportunity of drawing attention to articles 123 and 124 of the penal procedure, which read as follows :— Article 123. —The Examining Magistrate shall within 24 hours from the time the accused has appeared or is brought before him make the preliminary arraignment. If he is not arraigned within this period, the guards will take the accused to the miblic prosecutor of the Preliminarv Court who will call on the Examining Magis trate to arraign him at once. Should the latter refuse to do so or in case he is absent, or should he have plausible excuse for Lc333FD- ■ 70 delaying arraignment, the public prosecutor will call upon th President of the Court of the First Instance or one of the memh 61 thereof to be chosen by himself, to arraign the accused. Ders Article 124 .—If the accused who has been summoned or arrested sho to remain in custody more than 24 hours without being arraiJ^ by the Examining Magistrate and if, as stated in the fore^im! Article, no action is taken for the arraignment of the accused after he has appeared before the Public Prosecutor, such e0 n. finement will be considered as having been effected ’illegally ' wdiich case the guilty guard shall be dismissed from service* ’ 1U The Examining Magistrate and the Public Prosecutor shall also be dismissed from service for having thus trespassed their legal duties. 4. Davar half tried to leave himself a loophole by saying that if the facts were as stated by me it would seem that irregularities* must have occurred 1 replied that it was not a case of the word of the police against that of an accused person, as in the case of the search of Mr. Townshend-Smith’s house when the police denied his statement that it had been searched in his absence! In the present case Mr. Trott had obtained an absolutely definite admission from tiie “ Juge d’Instruction ” that Mr. Parsons had not yet been informed of the charges against him. I went on to say that it appeared that individuals could be kept under arrest for an indefinite period in Persian prisons without any prospect of being brought to trial. The Minister of Justice demurred to the word “ indefinite ”, but did not state what definite period could be con sidered the limit of time, nor did he express either contrition or surprise when I went on to refer to the case of the Indian, Karim Dad, who had been kept tor six months in gaol and finally released as innocent. He stated definitely in ansver to a diiect Question that this could not be regarded as an irregularity. He defended himself by saying that in all countries suspected persons 5 had to be kept under arrest until their case had been thoroughly investigated and that the investigations. might unfortunately take a considerable time. Only in Russia, so far as His Excellency knew, was it possible for the police to lay down a definite period in which the evidence against a prisoner must be prepared,— and that tor obvious reasons. m 5 '. 1 th | n . reverted ^o the refusal of the police to supply the Minister for oieign Affairs with the answers to my five questions contained in mv note ot April oth last (enclosure h,o. 2 m my despatch No. 159 of April 7th) (not received). I laid special stress upon the fact that no answer had been given to my question, repeated at frequent intervals, as to whether Mr. Parsons had expressed a desire to see His Majesty’s Consul. I now knew from his state ment to Mr Trott that he had expressed such a desire. I could not understand how the police dared to treat my representations, made through the Ministry 11 ii 1 /^ ail S! ’. ydh such insolence. I rather hoped that this remark would sting the two Ministers into a retort, but they made no attempt to argue. V1 ertmghi throughout the interview seemed uncomfortable and apologetic while Davar appeared to know a good deal less about these two cases than their impoi tance to our friendly relations would warrant. He repeated that he had been ailing and over-occupied with other work but that he would immediately investigate lie matter personally, and he hinted that the Townshend-Smith ease might before long reach a solution. I closed the discussion by insisting on speedy action, as I should have to report the recent serious developments Hl % M ii! eSty T 8 i Go 1 v 1 eriimont * could not foretell how they would view them*.

( 60 ) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran to the Foreign Office, London, No. 237, dated the 20th May 1933. In continuation of my despatch No. 228 of May 12th [Serial No. (59)], I have the honour to report that the Oriental Secretary to this Legation was invited bv Mirza Ali Akber Khan Davar, the Minister of Justice to call on him on May idth in regard to the Townshend-Smith and Parsons cases. 2. The Minister began by apologising for troubling Mr Trott on a Sunday, and regretted that he had not been able to see him the day bet ore. 3. He then began a very long discussion of the two cases. 4. Parsons. My statement that Parsons had not been informed of the accusation against him was a misunderstanding. Dayar had personally examined the'dossier very carefully, and had seen that the accusation against Parsons, which was that of “ spying ” had been communicated to him ; ^rs°ns had acknowledged in the dossier that he understood this and had added that was innocent of the offence : he only requested that he should be brought bet a competent court and given a proper trial. This declaration was signe Parsons himself and Davar had no doubt that Parsons understood what he was signing. The only irregularity which had taken place was that the accusaii against him was made known to him three days after arrest instead ^ ^ four hours. This irregularity would he dealt with. In reply Mr. 1 Davar exactly what had occurred in his interview at the prison wi i ‘ ^ He said that the “ mustantiq ” (juge d’instruction) had certain ^ to enter into the question of the accusation or to tell Parsons yha i t k ’ ^ when Mr. Trott had put the direct question to him he had not ansvemi had replied that he was not authorised to discuss the matter. ^ . Parsons had gone the “ mustantiq ” had not seen fit to make miy -P ^. g though he had ample opportunity to do so. Davar could Tlot 1UK 1 . p avar and promised to send for the “mustantiq” and mterroga e • repeated that he was certain that Parsons understood that he y as t Ur-oueht spying apd he suggested that when Parsons was released he s on face to face with his own signature in the dossier. Davar yen 0 the from his examination of the dossier he had received the impres^ b ee n evidence against Parsons was not very serious, and there na J* ^ p' ia t the unnecessary delays in his examination, due to the fact that it y as 1 . -i^natinfiT examination of Townshend-Smith would reveal something ,. ng that Parsons. But this was very unlikely and Davar had aiven m t oma ns. Parsons should he allowed hail in the sum of two hundred and . 1 ^ 5. Townshend-Smith. In this case the dossier was much ^ | a r&lt;re Davar considered the evidence affainst Townshend-Smith was g &lt; ia number of persons had given evidence incriminating him, • | v &lt;5eon^ all ; and though he denied all their statements the evidenc^ e ' , sP |lir^ to show that he had been engaged in some activity other ^ ia tion shouW coal. However, Davar had given strict instructions that the exa be pushed on as expeditiously as possible. ^enr^ 1 Mr. Trott askod Davar what exactly were the arrangements \ that the “ instruction ” should take place as quickly as possn cthat in Egypt and other countries it is often found that the examining magistrate refuses to give a further period to the u parquet ” to continue their investiga tions. Davar seemed very interested in this but said that no such provision existed in Persia. No time limit was mentioned in the “ qarar ” or mandate which the competent magistrate had to issue for the examination of the case. He simply gave permission, within twenty-four hours of the arrest, for the investigation to be carried on. Jalal had told him that in the Soviet Union there was a rule that the investigation had to be completed in ten days ; if there was such a rule it was unique. There was one great difference between the Persian system and European systems in this matter ; viz., that in Persia the accused persons were not allowed to have a lawyer to help them with their replies. This was found to be better because a lawyer often ensured that a gnilty person ^ot off ! A discussion then ensued concerning the frequency with which guilty parties escaped punishment owing to legal flaws and unfair help from clever advocates, Davar took the view that it.was more important to condemn guilty persons than to give prisoners the benefit of the doubt. He cited the opinion of certain Italian jurists to show that juries were a mistake and defeated the proper ends of justice. 7. As for the arrests in general, Davar made a very lengthy statement. To begin with, it was unfortunate that they had coincided with the Moscow arrests of British engineers. Davar was prepared to admit that the police were inclined to be too precipitate where suspicions of spying were involved. Persia, as far as its judicial organisation was concerned, was really only a young country with very little experience. There was no anti-British feeling. It was pressure from other directions which made the Persians jumpy. If a man thinks he is going to be fired at by an adversary who has what appears to be a revolver in his pocket, and then sees the adversary put his hand into that pocket, he attacks him at once without waiting to see whether the adversary is really only going to pull out his handkerchief. 80 it was with Persia. There was a psychological feeling of jumpiness. The memoirs of Agabekoff, and the published statement of Loganovsky, showed to what lengths a certain power was prepared to go. 8 . As for the prisoners, Davar had already given a full account of their cases. In future he would be greatly obliged if in similar cases Mr. Trott would ring him up direct so that he could get hold of the relevant dossier at once and do what was necessary. If one waited for papers to come through the official channels, much time was lost. Mr. Trott said he was delighted to hear this, and the only reason whv this had not hitherto been done was that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had always said that we should not deal with other Depart ments direct. .Davar said that that did pof apply to a reference to him in this way ; of course, our official communications had all to go to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. 9. Throughout the interview, which lasted about an hour and during which Davar talked extremely rapidly, he gave Mr. Trott the impression that he was doing his best to be very friendly indeed. 10 * 12 10. Parsons has now been released on bail, and Mr. Trott saw him yester day. He was quite positive that he was never formally charged and was almost sure that in the- course of a long interrogation by a senior police official no men tion was made of the fact that he was suspected of being a spy. If there was any reference to spying it was entirely incidental. When interrogated again on the twenty-fourth day of his arrest, he was asked “ Have you ever been a spy or not ? ”. H Thus it appears certain that there was no formal “ arraignment ” as contemplated’in Article 123 of the Code of Criminal Procedure quoted in my despatch No. 227 of May 12th [Serial No. (58)]. As soon as I have ascertained definitelv whether there is any other regulation bearing on the arraignment ” and what the normal procedure is, I propose to revert to the matter. M&lt;mn- while. I have given the Ministry of Foreign Affairs clearly to understand that in spite of Mr! Trott’s interview with Darar, I expect full written replies on all the points which I have raised. 12.

(64) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 219, dated the 6th May 1933. With reference to my despatch No. 183 of April 22nd [Serial No. (43)1, respecting the Safeguards, I have the honour to report that mv American colleague recently took an opportunity of speaking to the Minister tor r oreig Affairs about this subject. 2. Mr. Hart told Feroughi that he regarded very seriously the attitude adopted by the Persian Government in connexion with the two British subjects then under arrest. He had no intention of entering into details or into juntbea niceties, but he wished His Highness clearly to understand that had the Stl attitude been adopted in connexion with the arrest of an American citizen would have insisted upon the scrupulous execution of the Safeguards. I he ►-a e- guards represented an undertaking by the Persian Government to col ^ or ! n , certain standards in the administration of their laws and whatever the. leg position, they were under an international and moral obligation to mam am those standards. The words in which these standards were laid down were V result of discussions with powers whose legal systems were of the Anglo-oax _ type, as well as with powers applying the Civil Code. The Persian Govenime could not therefore excuse themselves (on the particular point ot yb slTS , arrested persons) on the ground that no other country applying the civil o made express provision for visits by Consuls to their nationals under aim • The question was not entirely academic, because the police had recently -attemp . to arrest Mr. Dubois (the representative of Ulen and Company) and only ai because he had left the country three months before. His Highness v remember the language the State Department had used when Mr. Dubois ^ refused a visa and could no doubt imagine the language they would have &gt;MSSSEBtoni 77 if Mr. Dubois had been arrested and kept in prison for weeks without the American Consul being allowed to see him. 3. Feroughi’s defence was that he had never denied the validity of the Safeguards, and the British Legation had even been informed that they were ^ still valid. (Presumably he was referring to the mention, in the note enclosed in my despatch No. 159 of April 7th, of the “ Circular of May 1928 ”) (not received). But that did not alter the fact that the Safeguards were unnecessary. To this Mr. Hart retorted that recent events made it apparent to him that they were as necessary as ever. He would not prolong the discussion, but he thought it as well to let His Highness know his views before rather than after an incident happened. 4. Mr. Hart’s conversation was prompted by the fact that a certain Monsieur Pussi, a Russo-Ttalo-Armenian carpet-dealer who has at some time in his career obtained an American passport, is supposed to be threatened with arrest Monsieur Dussi makes a regular habit of circulating to various Legations and institutions memoranda upon current events largely based upon the remarks of the Prime Minister, with whom he is on intimate terms. The American Legation have advised him to stop circulating these memoranda for the time being. 5. The Counsellor of the German Legation has had no difficulty in interview ing Dr. Lmdenblatt, the late Manager of &gt; the National Bank, who was arrested a tew days ago. On the advice of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs he applied direct to the public prosecutor in charge of the 'case, who gave his permission at once. The examination of Dr. Lindenblatt has, of course, been proceeding for some time, and the case against him may be practically complete. b. In the meanwhile fresh trouble has arisen for the German Legation in the arrest of a German electrician who is supposed to have been guilty of negli gence in connexion with a fire that occurred a few days ago in the Shah’s spinning-mill at Aliabad Shahi. 7. 1 am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 93).

The other Legation do not, however, seem to have sent official acknowledgments. ’ ’ Lc333FDThen insert new paragraphs •— “ The note addressed to Sir Robert Clive on May 10th 1928, and his-reply were subsequently published by the Foreign Office [Cd. Persia No. 1 (1930)] together \vith the Tariff Autonomy Treaty and various other notes exchanged at the same time. The Safeguard note does not seem to have been registered with the League of Nations*” “ () n the other hand the French Government, who had also published the note received by their Minister together with an Accord Provisoire signed at that time, did register the note, as well as the Accord Provisoire, with . the League of Nations. No official protest seems to have been made, but Monsieur Hesse, the French legal adviser to the Persian Government, later told the French Minister that his employers had been much * hurt ’ at the breach of faith committed by the French Government in thus registering a document which had not been intended to have any such publicity.” “ In the course of the summer of 1928, the German Legation were engaged in negotiating various treaties and attempted to embody the Safe^ guards in a Protocol to be attached to their Establishment Treaty, In this they were unsuccessful and they relinquished the idea the more readily because they realised that if the Safeguards were given a formal setting, the Persian Government would ask for reciprocity, which was impossible under German law. They eventually contented themselves with a declaration by the Persian Government that the Safeguards were all supported by Persian legislation. ’ r “ In the course of an action brought in the summer of 1928 against the German firm of Wenckhaus, the lawyer for the plaintiffs declared that Persian law could not recognise the Safeguards, because they had not been approved by the Mejliss, but were contained only in notes signed by a representative of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. (They were actually signed by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs.) ” Page 7 .—Insert, after paragraph ending “ same as the British text ” :— “ The publication of the note to the British Legation took place by accident. An official of the Ministry of Justice had on his desk a pile of circulars embodying the notes which were about to be distri buted throughout the country to law courts and officials. He thought lessly gave one to a journalist friend who called at that moment. Such an outcry arose that the Political Director-General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, in order to prove that these concessions were not granted to British subjects alone, promptly arranged for the publication of the Soviet and the general safeguards. This - prompt action was, unfortunately, not well received by his Govern ment and he was suspended from his duties for about a month as a sign of the displeasure which he had incurred. ,r Page S, line 8 .—After “ orally ” add :— “ in the course of discussions about the right of the Persian Government to refuse permission to a foreign Consul to visit one of his nationals m prison ’L Page 8 .— At the end of the paragraph ending “ no sort of engagement what- er ” add :— “ Against this point of view must be set the fact that the note-of May 10th states that its contents represent ‘ dispositions prises per la legisla tion et le Gouvernement person a phrase which may be given various interpretations, for instance :— {a) that some of the provisions derived their validity, not from ain particular law or regulation, but from administrative decisions taken hy the Government within the exercise of author it} bestowed upon it by some particular law or reglilation, ^b) that all the provisions derive their validity equally and simul taneously from the law and from the willingness (or ability, ni duty) of the Government to make that law applicable to foreigners^suttarrirt-i 79 (c) that some of the provisions derive their validity, not from the law at all, but from acts of sovereignty performed by the Govern ment in its capacity as an international person. Having regard to the situation which existed in May 1928, when many of the safeguards were admittedly not covered by legislation, (c) is perhaps a reasonable interpretation, the intention of the Government being to make good the deficiencies of the law by administrative action until such time as they could alter the law.

The note of May 10th was never approved by the Mejliss and was not signed under full powers from the Shah ; but it might be maintained that these facts do not necessarily absolve the Persian Government from the duty of giving legal and constitutional validity to the note if it does not possess these attributes already.” Page 11, last line.—For the words “ but neither to end of paragraph, JSUDSLltUP— “ iliat is to say the supplementary prison regulations issued under Article 37 of the original regulations.

In continuation of my despatch No. 526 of the 10th December 1932 [Serial No. (71) in File No. 1-N.'|32], I have the honour to report that a new conseit d’administration lias been formed at the National Bank, consisting of Mirza Hussein Khan Ala, 0. M. G., Mirza Muhammad Ali Khan Farzin and Herr Walter Horschitz-Horst. 2. I have already reported in my despatch referred to above that Ala was reluctant to take over the post of Chairman, since he knows nothing about banking. 3. Farzine was previously known as Mirza Muhammad Ali Khan Club, as he rose to fame by his excellent management of the Tehran Club several years ago. He was one of Teymourtache’s men, and in 1929 was Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs for several months. In that post he was excessively polite and always agreed thoroughly with everything that was said to him, but as lie never bv any chance did anything he was quite useless. In 1930 he was sent to Berlin as Minister ; but as a result of the unfortunate articles in the Munchenef Illustrierte Presse concerning the Shah he was recalled early in 1932. Since then be has been unemployed. I can hardly imagine that he knows anything about banking, though as he ran the Club well he may have some idea of business, lie is a quiet, reserved man, who gives one the impression of being a monument of benevolent uselessness. 4. Herr Horschitz-Horst’s appointment is referred to in Berlin despatch No. 90 of January 27th to your Department. 5. It is noteworthy that Hussein Quli Khan Nawab is not on the board. I learn from several sources that the Shah is fast losing faith in his ability. ( 68 ) (Received on 3rd June 1933, with Political Secretary's letter No. 20, dated 18th May 1933.) (E.-2448j631|34.)

On March 4th the Bazaar was closed as a mark of condolence for the death at Kum of Mirza Sadig Agha Mujtahid. He had been exiled for his sermons against Conscription and the introduction of the Pehlevi hat, and had since refused the Shah’s offers to allow him to return to Tabriz upon promise of good behaviour.

Early in the month all those who had entered Azerbaidjan vunout a proper passport were—upon orders from Tehran—exiled to S. Persia81 (Isfahan, Kerman, etc.). .

Saltan Mustaia Khan is now acting commander. Manoeuvres.—0\\ March 2nd, the Military began to call up the disbanded professional reservists : and some appear to have been sent towards Teheran It is now said that the time-expired conscripts are to be all called up for general training or manoeuvres in April or May. 40,000 is mentioned as the total number expected to be under arms in the two Military Commands Promotions.—'The Generals of both the Western and Eastern Azerbaijan Commands were promoted from Sartib to Amir-Lashgar on the Shah’s birthdav • and many of their subordinate officers were also promoted in rank. * ’ Amir-Lasbaar Mohtashami left Tabriz on inspection in the Ardabil district about March 26th. h ew Armaments.—Both Azerbaijan armies are said to have now been served out with new Czechoslovakian rifles (Breno ? system).

There are rumours that some kerosene and benzine may arrive here shortly • ^ i, ^ s r °ute ; but so far none has materialized, nor is the supposed provenance known. Weather .—The weather has continued very bad for the most part—with some intervals of sunshine and thaw which rendered roads in the town quagmires and delayed communications with Teheran and Julfa. Snow fell 8 times in .March, the heaviest fall being on March 31st (8 inches). It has snowed since the end of the month ; on April 1st, 2nd, 3rd and to-dav April 4th. • The German Consul returning from Tehran took 3 days to negotiate the stretch from Zinjan to Mianeh (an easy day’s run is Zinjan-Tabriz)' ; and the post has been irregular at times. I complained on March 12th in writing of the neglected state of the roads right in front of this Consulate and of the adjoining approaches—pointing out that in this small zone there were 5 owners of motor cars who paid the motor-tax of 10 tomans a month, and 3 Consulates. The Governor-General has not even trouble to reply ! The town Police, upon fresh orders from Teheran, are extra zealous over checking all intercourse between suspected Pro-Bolsheviks and other inhabitants. I myself went to an Armenian house in a car to fetch some new lamp-shades made for us to my wife’s specification and urgently needed for a big party we were giving next day. It turned out that the good lady—the only person in the town capable of making anything reasonably decorative—had a husband, working away in Teheran, who was suspected of Bolshevik sympathies. I learnt later that after my visit she had been subjected to a long cross- examination by the Police Commissary of the Quarter ; who refused to believe that—as the matter was urgent I had merely literally obeyed mv wife’s orders Lc333FD- not to leave without the shades ” One was not ready and I wmted about an hour while the lady and her 2 little sisters aged about 8 or 9 finished it. The Commissary wanted all details of the conversation ! It will be recalled that in his despatch 48-Confidential of October 24th, , Mr Vet in o 1 Consul Davis reported that a similar surveillance was exercised in the case of Captain Bamfield and the Bezaich Assyrians. I quote the passage below for convenience of reference . “ 2 Their visit had an interesting sequel which I feel it incumbent on mvself to report to von. A traveller who has recently arrived from Rezaieh states that they were closely observed by the Police during their stav there and after their departure every single person to whom they had spoken was arrested, closely interrogated and forced to state* exactly what they had said, what money they had spent and what had been the purpose of their visit. The Bamfields'also visited some villages near Rezaieh, and the Police likewise summoned people from these villages and questioned them in the same manner. T] ie ir o-mde an Assyrian of Rezaieh, was arrestee! and put in prison. It is said'that he may be sent to Tabriz for further enquiries to be made. 3 The fact that Captain Bamfield was an officer of the ’Iraq Levies, that lie spoke syriac, had an Assyrian servant, took an Assyrian guide, and spoke principally with the Assyrians in Rezaieh and the villages k f _ * 1 O ] 4 -V. ^ r,,, r\Tl C« 1 Vl 11 PnT'Dlon around, seems authorities. to have 0 aroused the suspicions of the Persian o. 6 . 4 The Persians, for no apparent reason, seem to have become afraid of the Assyrian element in the Rezaieh area recently. They have exiled some members of the community to Tabriz. They have prevented Assyrians from Russia, ’Iraq, Hamadan and Rerman- shah from returning to settle in Rezaieh and have obliged them to settle in Zinjan and other towns far from the fellow-country-men. I gather from mv informant that the Police tried to find out whether Captain Bamfield had given or promised to send any money, arms or ammunition from ’Iraq to the Assyrians of Rezaieh, or whether he had brought any messages or done any propaganda on hehalt or the Assyrians in ’Iraq. Mrs. Bamfield lost her handbag containing her passport, papers, monev, etc., on October 5th, between Khaneh Customs post a the Perso-’Iraq frontier. Whether this loss was purely a coiner deuce or whether someone was anxious to examine the contents oi the handbag is an interesting speculation to which unfortunately satisfactory answer can be given. 7. Captain and Mrs. Bamfield stated that they had been very ^ . treated bv the Persian authorities throughout their trip. rbe&gt; M nothing but praise for the splendid reception they had recei d li along the road. It seems all the more repettahle that the im ^ people with whom they had spoken at kezaieh should ha suffer for it.” . , I may add that on my visits to Rezaich I have made a point of stay with the American Mission—which m amised of ha\ n g | Assyrians to cross into ’Iraq to evade Conscription. Despite this my desultory prowlings in the Rezaieh Bazaar have at ancc resulted in the appearance in the Bazaar of policemen at every crossing allevs ! I have also personally at Rezaieh refused to receive calls from The zeal of the Tabriz Police Officer above mentioned appears part inexplicable and a most unflattering estimate of my own supposed opim ^ ^ Russian Trade Organizations,—The frontier was closed on ^ [ar( f the following persons were said to be packing up to leave on or aoou 25th :— Vneshtorg. —-Veitsakhovski, the Chief Account.S3 Bureau-Perse. —Faltzman, and Hacobian. So far, however, only two minor employees of the Vneshtorg Zudin and Grotzin—have actually left ; while one Sitchew has actually arrived here, presumably to replace one of them. As there have been some small exchanges of goods in the last days of the month, it is impossible at present to discover whether the breach is of a perma nent or only a temporary character. 1 Consular Imports. —The Customs interpret Licences, etc., very strictly. In the case of one licence granted me (really to Mr. Davis) which included 3 cases of Government Stationery and 2 separate articles for private use, one of which had not yet arrived, they declared that the value of the cases of stationery plus the transport exhausted the whole 120 tomans of the Licence. After a long telephonic conversation (the Station Customs are 5 miles away) I succeeded in one or other of my various argnments that :— # (a) As no duty was payable on Government Stationery it seemed ridi culous to insist on its exact value. {h) That when my acting predecessor requisitioned this Stationery he could have had no idea at all of its exact cost price, the price of the packing cases, or the cost of transport from Kermanshah. (c) That in any case the article still to come was only worth 35 Rials (7 shillings) and it was a hardship in view of what preceded to expect me to applj' for a new licence for it. I finally succeeded in recovering the licence for use with the outstanding article. t)n another occasion the Director of the Town Customs Branch was officially reprimanded for allowing me to withdraw a parcel of cutlery upon production by me of the licence covering it. He should, apparently, have waited till the copy reached him “ in due course ”. ' This second copy was actually at the Station Customs ; while the parcel of cutlery had been lying 2 months in the Customs here, having been reforwarded from Kermanshah under a Passavant. My new German Colleague had 1,000 cigars reach him which he was import ing under the 9—months “ first installation ” clause. He was at first told that he had to pay 250 tomans duty, and this he agreed to do. Later in the same day he received 2 telephonic calls and a visit from an Official—each time to point out that there were new regulations and errors had been made. Between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. the duty payable was increased to 450 tomans, 050 tomans, and finally 671 tomans ! No doubt the last figure is correct, but Herr Schroder who bad actually taken the cigars out—but fortunately not started to smoke them—is going to return them to Germany ! The Customs will thus not benefit at all. I myself have now 15 parcels of books (mostly cheap novels) accumulated in the Customs ; and no licence has apparently been granted for them, though I applied for one as far back as February 14th. These delays, the absence of reading matter especially during the never-ending winter, and the markedly obstructionist and almost truculent attitude of the Persian Customs Officials do not add to the amenities of life here.

Despatch from His Majesty’s _ Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, Loxdon, No. 159, dated the 7th April 1933. In m\ despatch Jso. 145 of the 3rd April I forwarded to you, without com ment, a copy of a note that I had received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs concerning the case of Mr. Townshend-Smith, whose house was recently searched by the police. i\r m Thl l n ? t o’ . aS . you wil1 have seen &gt; states the offences of which Mr ’ Townshend-Simth is suspected, that is, espionage and the smuggling of gold ° l vd i A 16 coailtry ’ an ^ full particulars of the codes and enactments under vhich these charges would be framed. To this extent the note is satisfactory. 3. Even more satisfactory—in view of the tendency shown of late bv members of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in conversation with my collea gues (though not so far with anyone in this Legation) to regard the “ Safe guards ’’ as a transitional measure which the perfection of the Persian judicial system has now rendered obsolete—is the very definite reference to the aleguards ” m the note, even though they are described as the “ circular ” or May, 1J^8, and not as a note to this Legation. question whether or not the Detective police really did apply to the public prosecutor for a warrant before searching the house is one upon 'Vlt ^ ome is permissible, but as it may be taken for granted that thev would have had not the slightest difficulty in obtaining a wmrrant if they had app red, the point is not of practical importance when compared to the admis sion ot the principle. Lc333FD8G 5. I think there is little doubt that although a preliminary search may have been made of the house while Mr. Townshend-Smith was still there, the real search, as well as the seizure of his papers, took place after he had been re moved to the police station. I had intended to ask Mr. Townshend-Smith to^ make an affidavit as to the circumstances of the visit, but the news has just reached me that he has been placed under arrest in the Detective police prison. I have accordingly sent the Minister for Foreign Affairs the reply of which I enclose a copy, reserving my right to advert to this and other aspects of the case at a later date. 6. I am not disposed to press the question of the additional visits paid to Mr. Townshend-Smith’s house in his absence on subsequent days, as his Per sian mistress behaved rather foolishly on these occasions, producing identity papers that really belonged to her sister and answering incorrectly one or two questions, not, it is true, of material importance. It is worth recording, how ever, that on one of these occasions she was asked whether Russians ever visited the house or whether her “ husband ” had any dealings with the late Treasurer of the Court, Diba (see my despatch No. 102 of 11th March, 1933). The answer in each case was “ Yes, for the purchase of coal ”. Mr. Townshend- Rmith, I may explain, is the owner of a coal-mine in the neighbourhood of Tehran and conducts all his own sales in person. 7. The arrest of Mr. Townshend-Smith follows on that of a Mr. Parsons, a motor-driver who has been out here since the war and was only recently dismissed from the service of Hussein, Quli Khan Nizam-Qaragozlo ( Am ir Nizam) one of the Shah’s Masters of Ceremonies. Air. Parsons was placed under arrest about three weeks ago and though I have as yet received no official information I learn from the Chief of Police that in his case also the. charge is espionage. Several others, Russians, Persians and Armenians are, I believe, detained on similar charges. I enclose a copy of a note that I have addressed to the Alinister for Foreign Affairs about Air. Parsons. 8. I have not as yet formed any clear idea of the best way in which to help Air. Townshend-Smith or Air. Parsons. One is naturally inclined, especially wtih recent happenings in the Soviet Union in mind, to forget that the capitula tions have passed away and to regard it as inadmissible that the Persian authorities should arrest or imprison any British subject. Aloreover, when the facts become known, T fear that those elements in the country which are not abreast of modern thought on this subject may regard them as a further sign of olir inability to protect our nationals—unless, indeed, they assume that this, like everything else, is done “ with our permission ”. The case derives further importance from the fact that except for a British motor-driver named Alartin, wffio killed a Kurdish boy with his lorry and was kept for about a month in the police detention quarters at Kermanshah ivhile the public pro secutor (who eventually decided not to prosecute) was considering the matter, Air. Townshend-Smith and Air. Parsons are, I believe, the first European British subjects to be placed under arrest by the Persian authorities. 9. At present I incline to the opinion that the most prudent course, and the one best calculated to help the men under arrest, will be to limit my repre sentations to insisting that all expedition shall be used to complete the en quiries, so that they may be either released or brought to trial at an early date, and to insist that the trial, if not held in public, shall be attended by a representative of the Legation, who shall have full liberty to inspect any docu mentary evidence that may be produced. . . 10* I may add that there is some reason to think that the police are sus picious of certain other British subjects who are engaged here in business on their own account. The Persian Government seem at the moment to be almost as hysterical on file subject of espionage as the Soviet Government. Among other examples ma\ quote the fact that two voung officers from India, one an Aide de camp to the \ iceroy and one an Aide de camo to the Commander-in-Chief, who are here on a shooting trip, were followed from Zahedan to Afeshed by a police (e ec n e, while Sir Aurel Stein, who in connection with his work, which he exp amed m detail to all the higher Authorities last spring, 'wished to visit ■' S P°1 s lather off the beaten track in southern Persia, has had so many -mi/-/ 11 S r) 1 a ^ 0&lt; ^ 171 way that he has for the present abandoned the idea and returned to India.Note by His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, No. 169, dated the 7th April 1933. I 1ir\g the honour to acknowlGd^G the receipt of Your Highness’ note No. 687 of Farvardine 8th (March 28th) in which you give me certain infor- nation regarding the case of Mr. Townshend-Smith. 2. I note that in order to comply with Article 6 of the judicial measures of May l()th, 1928, steps were taken, before the visit to Mr. Townshend-Smith’s house took place, to obtain the necessary authority from the public prosecutor of the Court ot First Instance, but it does not appear that this authorisation was shown to Mr. Townshend-Smith or that he was informed, as Your Highness’ note asserts, of the nature of the suspicions which had occasioned the search of his house. 3. In view, however, of the fact that Mr. Townshend-Smith has, as I have just learned, been placed under arrest, he will be unable to comply with a request sent to him to visit one of my staff whom 1 had instructed to obtain from him further details of the first and subsequent visits paid by the police to his house. I cannot therefore do more for the moment than reserve my right to advert to this and other aspects of the case at a later date. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Highness the assur ance of my highest consideration.

I shall be grateful if your Highness will cause urgent enquiries to be made as to which magistrate signed the warrant of arrest, what charge is being preferred against Mr. Parsons, and whether he has expressed a desire to see His Majesty’s Consul. 4. I shall also be glad to know without delay whether he has yet been brought before an examining magistrate and what arrangements have been made for bail. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Highness the assur ance of my highest consideration. Enclosure 6 to Serial No. (69).

On April 10th I asked that Mr. Trott should have interview with Townshend-Smith. As my representations produced no result I sent extreme ly stiff note about both cases on April 17th which produced aggrieved and unsatisfactory answer yesterday followed by telephone message this morning that arrangements had been made for Mr. Trott to see Townshend-Smith on April 22nd. I afterwards saw Minister for Foreign Affairs and told him that it was a disastrous moment to choose at which to create the impression that British subjects were denied assistance of Consuls. Public opinion in England would never admit that paragraph 7 of Persian Note of May, 10th, 1928 did not mean what it clearly said After more in the same strain I invited Minister for Foreign Affairs’ attention to various passages in your speech of April 5th which ex- plained the British view in such cases and which justified serious anxiety I felt. I added that he would realise on reading passages in question that I was not suggesting that Persian police methods were similar. Minister for Foreign Affairs seemed really impressed and I have hopes that he will now insist on both cases being dealt with promptly.Enclosure 7 of Serial No. (69). (E.-2211|1622|34).

Minute by the Oriental Secretary of His Majesty’s Legation, Tehran, dated 22nd April 1933. Enclosure to Serial No. (71). Townshend-Smith. —This morning at 9-30, T received a message from Jelal saying that 1 could go to see Townshend-Smith at Qasr-i-Qajar prison. I went there in my car with the Mir Aklpir, arriving just after 10 a.m. A number of policemen were waiting at the gate and I was evidently ex pected. 1 was conducted to a room in which I was given a chair. A greasy- - looking man named Mirza Aghan Khan Kamran introduced himself as the “ mustantiq ” (interrogator—“ juge d’instruction ”) of the Ta’minat ; and he produced an interpreter named Mirza Ahmad Khan Sharifi—a young man educated at the American College. Kamran started off by saying that although the “ instruction ” of Townshend-Smith was not entirely finished, there was no objection to my seeing him. He hoped to get the “ instruction ” finished by the end of this week ; it was practically at an end. He asked that I should be careful not to say anything to Townshend-Smith about the matters of which he was accused. I could ask him about how he felt, about how he passed his time, how he was treated in the prison, how he liked his food, etcetera. I said that before I saw Townshend-Smith I wanted to say two things :— (1) About his wife. Could it be arranged that his wife should see him ? Kamran said that it might be arranged and he would do what he could. The wife, in his view, was “ must ” (a word usually translated ‘ drunk ’, but not invariably ; perhaps ‘ dotty ], ‘ un balanced” or something similar was what he meant). I said that if he had had his wife taken off and put into prison suddenly it might make him a bit “ mast ’’—and as a matter of fact the night before last the woman had taken a large dose of opium with the idea of killing herself ; luckily she did not succeed. I rubbed in this point and Kamran acknowledged that the woman had a right to be anxious and he promised to do what he could to arrange a meeting. (2) About Townshend-Smith ’s business. I mentioned the complaints that we had received that Townshend-Smith’s business was being interfered with. Kamran said that they had gone into that and it was not true. No interference had taken place. And moreover, if the prisoner’s business did suffer, the Persian Government was responsible ; if it could be proved that such interference had taken place, the Government which during the time of imprisonment was Lc333FDresponsible for losses suffered, would have to pay compensation I then asked whether Townshend-Smith could he authorised to see- Haji (Townshend-Smith *8 munshi). Kamran said that there was no objection. If I would tell Haji to come to see him at No. 4 Section of the Ta’minat, he would arrange to bring up Haji with him the next time he came up to the prison, in order that Townshend-Smith could see him and make all the dispositions necessary about the conduct of his business. I was then conducted to a window of the same room, which had no glass but had vertical iron bars ; it gave on to the interior courtyard of the prison. Townshend-Smith was, as to speak 1 discovered ’ sitting on the other side of the bars, with a policeman standing by his side. He grinned and shook hands through the bars. He looked rather grimy, but was quite cheerful. I asked him how he was and he said he was very well, and was having a jolly good rest cure doing nothing. The only thing was he did not get enough exercise. Could he have permission to walk about more ? Kamran immediately said that he would arrange that. And as for food, the only complaint he had was that he got too much. That silly woman, his wife, would keep sending up cooked fowls, which he could not eat ; he gave a lot of his food away. Perhaps I could tell his wife not to send so much meat, but to send more fruit. I agreed to do this. He repeated that he had no complaints to make as to treatment, and evidently meant it. Kamran and he talked to one another rather as if they were old friends. One other matter was worrying him. Certain bills or drafts, payable by a certain Jones (presumably the Manager of the British tannery) were due to be presented very soon and Townshend-Smith was afraid that if they were not presented payment wmuld be refused. Kamran promised to arrange this when he brought up Haji to see him. He also asked for a towel. I am telling Haji to take one. I told Towmshend-Smith that Mr. Wilkinson of the Imperial Bank of Persia had promised to provide Haji with certain money to go on with in order that the business might be carried on. After about half an hour’s talk I shook hands again through the bars and left. The head of the prison did not appear ; I was told that he was ill ; but his assistant, a civil looking officer, was present, accompanied by a very woe begone person who was introduced as the prison doctor. Jalal also told me this morning that he had procured a copv of section 120 of the prison regulations and was sending it to us. (Initialled) A. C. T.,—22-4-33.

Oriental Secretary was at last allow T cd to see Parsons this morning in the presence of officials. Speaking in Persian he stated that shortly after his arrest he asked to be allowed to see the Consul and that he wished to know what the charges against him were. A\ ith regard to the first point it is to be noted that for over a month I have noon enquiring whether he had made such a request and in spite of the utmost pressure have failed to obtain reply. Jugo d’instruction in reply to Oriental Secretary confirmed the fact that he iiaci not been informed of charges. .

From Rashidi case you will realise that practice of imprisoning persons who are viewed with disfavour for indefinite periods without trial is increasing, police being a law unto themselves under * the Shah, and unless we take strong line now there are indications that we can expect serious trouble over treatment of British Indians.

So far as I can learn as the result of repeated enquiries of lour Highness’ Department, little or no progress is being made. I therefore pro pose to review both cases. 3. From Your Highness’ note No. 687 of March 28th (Farvardine 8th) [Enclosure A, of Serial No. (69)], I learnt that “ the police received reports from the middle of Behman Mali, 1311 ” against Mr. Townshend-Smith. His house was searched on February 28th (EsfamJ 9th, 1311) (about a fortnight later) and his papers were subsequently examined at the Taminat. Two letters, to which I shall revert, were retained by the police. On April 5th (Farvardine 16th) Mr. Townshend-Smith was arrested. On April 10th (Farvardine 21st) I requested Your Highness to arrange for Mr. Trott to see him in prison. At first it appeared that this request would be granted, but I was subsequently informed on April 13th (Farvardine 24th) that it must be refused in view ol Article 120 of the prison regulations. [(The visit was eventually allowed to take place on April 22nd (Ordibehesht 2nd) (. For the next ten days the Legation made repeated efforts to obtain from the Ministry of Justice and the ^ copy of these regulations, and finally received them on May 2nd (Ordihehesn 12th) through the good offices -of Your Highness Department. Mr* /T 0 ', was informed by the “ Mushfentiq ” of the Taminat when he visite^ Mr. Townshend-Smith that he “ hoped to get the instruction finisljod by the en of this week ”, which meant by April 27th (Ordibehesht 7th) ; my latest tion, received from Your Highness’ Department on May 2nd (Ordibehesht IM / is, however, that the investigation would last another twelve days. 4. If this proves to be the case, a British subject will have been kept in pnson for 38 days without being brought to trial. 5. I have no desire to pre-judge the case, but T wish to bring to Your Highness’ notice certain reflections on the manner in which it has hitherto conducted :— ' *72 (1) The police began their investigations “ in the middle of Rahman, 1311 ” • (2) They searched Mr. Townshend-Smith’s house about a fort nigh later ;(3) According to my information, two of his papers only were retained by the police ; (4) He was not actually placed in detention until six weeks later. These four facts make it evident that the correspondence seized was of no value to the police and that the police, in conducting a search of Mr. Townshend-Smith’s papers, were acting on information which proved to be false. It is a natural inference that the long delay in preparing the case (or in deciding that there is no case) is due to the fact that the police, having failed to obtain from Mr. Townshend-Smith’s papers any confirmation of the denuncia tions mentioned in \oui Highness above-mentioned note, have been seeking for it and have delayed bringing him to trial because there is no evidence against him to justify a remand. If this is so, I regard the action taken as contrary to the generally accepted principles of justice. If I am considered to be wrong in my appreciations, I shall be grateful if Your Highness will obtain and com municate to me the facts which are held to establish my error. 6. So much for the Townshend-Smith case. 7. Mr. Parsons was arrested on March 13th (Esfand 22nd, 1311). On April oth (Farvardine 16th, 1312) I requested Your Highness to obtain for me the answers to five perfectly simple questions which I enumerate below and which, as I informed Your Highness on April 19th (Farvardine 30th) last, could have been answered by the police over the telephone in five minutes had they chosen to do so :— (a) who signed the warrant of arrest. (b) what charges were preferred. (c) had Mr. Parsons asked to see His Majesty’s Consul. (d) whether he had been brought before an examining magistrate. (e) what arrangements had been made for bail. 8. On April 24th (Ordibehesht 4th) I received from Your Highness a note No. 2254, containing a reply to the first two questions, but it has hitherto proved to be impossible to extract a fbply to the others. I shall be glad if Your Highness will obtain these answers and also a statement explaining (if there is Highness on April 29th (Ordibehesht 9th, 1312) to arrange for Mr. Trott to visit Mr. Parsons on May 2nd (Ordibehesht 12th). Again there has been a quite improper delay and the visit had been arranged only for to-morrow. 9. As Your Highness is aware, Mr. Parsons has now been in prisofn for 54 days without trial ; I shall be glad to learn whether the investigations are approaching completion. 10. In conclusion I would urge Your Highness to invite the attention of the Minister of Justice to both these, cases, which suggest that some authority appears to believe that it is permissible to keep men in prison for an indefinite period without trial and to refuse to British subjects the right to communicate with their Consul in anv circumstances whatsoever. I submit furthermore that the case of the British' Indian, Abdul Ghafur Jatala, which formed the subject of my letter of April 17th (Farvardine 28th 1312) also merits His Fxcellencv s I avail myself of this,opportunity to renew to Your Highness the assurance of my highest consideration. P'g —Since writing this note, I have learnt, without, receiving any ex planation which I can accept, that Mr. Trott’s visit to Mr. Parsons has again been put off. Despatch from the British Legation, Gulhek, to the Foreign Office, Loxdon,95 been in London then myself and I could personally assure His Highness that this was the case. Evidently the successful issue of Sir John Cadman’s visit had now produced a much more favourable state of public opinion in the United Kingdom. As an instance, I produced a copy of the “ Times ” leading article ^&gt;f June 1st, which 1 was rather surprised to find Feroughi had already read. 2. The Minister said that he recognised that a great and most pleasant change had been brought about by the oil agreement. The Shah himself was now most benevolently disposed towards Great Britain and we must all do our best to profit by this mood while it lasted. I answered that His Majesty’s Minister had fully realized this and that he much hoped that when he returned in the autumn the outstanding questions between the two Governments would be quickly settled. Feroughi said that the Treaty negotiations ought not to prove too difficult, now that the question of the oil, which had been a real grievance with Persia, was out of the way. I expressed the hope that the Shah would give orders that the negotiations must be pursued diligently ; in that case perhaps a week’s hard work, day and night in the Cadman style, would produce a final result. Feroughi laughingly agreed that we should have to try this method. 3. His Highness then related to me his view of the history of our relations since that baleful year 1907. He knew that there were reasons of high policy for our agreement with Russia ; he admitted that the Russians had not played the game under the agreement ; the fact remained, however, that the British had then lost many of their friends and had never regained them since. Then came the war, and then that “ blunder of Lord Curzon’s ”, the abortive agreement of 1919. We could have obtained almost all our desiderata without any written document : the instrument itself and even more the way in which we attempted to impose it upon the country had done us infinite damage. At the very moment when the agreement was being secretly negotiated in Tehran a Persian delegation, of which lie himself was a member, was refused admission to the Pans Peace Conference. Since then, no doubt, there had been an improvement, due in great measure to the wisdom and tact of Sir Percy Loraine, but the oil question had rankled and prevented complete reconciliation. Feroughi even hinted that this had been a reason for the utter lack of finality in the long drawn-out treaty negotiations. 4 His Highness repeated to me what he said he had often told Sir Percy Loraine, namely, that the interests of our two countries were alike and that by nature we were designed to be friends. It was only the British eirors m diplomacy since 1907 which had engendered suspicion of our motives. 1 answered that whatever errors there might have been, our real policy towards Ppvcnn hod for nianv years past remained constant. It was clearly m oui interest that Pprsia should be strong and independent ment of 1919 had only this object in view, although I admitted there was force in Feroughi’s criticisms of it. Anyhow, thetime had surely come to bury the nasi and make a fresh start from the date of the new oil concession. The be. t wav to do this would be to clear away the brushwood. The Persian Government ought to aim at avoiding any petty annoyances such as had only too trequentl' occurred lately in order that you, Sir, might be convinced of the sincerity of their protestations of friendship. Feroughi cordially agreed and we parted with mutual expressions of goodwill. ,. c , ■ ,, • , 5 T am certain that the present nervousness regarding the Soviet s inten tions towards Persia, combined with satisfaction over the oil agreement, is tm n- in&lt;- the tide si owl V but snrelv, in our favour just now. Fresh impetus will he given to the' current if agreement can be reached at Geneva about the exclusion of the Persian Gulf from the prohibited zones under the Arms Traffic Conven tion Feroughi mentioned that he had received satisfactory reports on this suhioct and declared categorically that such an agreement would be an event ot gei,U 6 n I mm'sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 124).

LvtTEE from the India Office, to thf Fokeion Office, London, No. P.Z.-2436I33, DATED THE, 12tH MAV I.'OO. With reference to Foreign Office letter No. X.-2599|17]503 of 27th April 1933 (below) on the object of the proposed appointment of a third munshi at His96 Majesty’s Tjegation, Tehran, I am directed by the Secretary of State for Indi- to say that in the circumstances explained by His Majesty’s Minister, Tehr he concurs in the proposals in paragraph 2 of your letter and is prepared accept as a charge upon Indian revenues a moiety of the expenditure involve! on the understanding that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury accept th&lt;^ other moiety. ^ Enclosure to Serial No. (79). Letter from the Foreign Office, to the India Office, No. X.-25991171503 dated the 27th April 1933. I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to refer to your letter P.-3355 29 of the 3rd June 1929, relative to the emoluments of the munshis at His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran and to transmit herewith, for the information of the Secre tary of State for India in Council, a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Minister reviewing the circumstances in which the post of third munshi was suspended in 1930 and requesting that the post may be re-instituted. 2. Although Sir John Simon considers that the need for a third munshi is clear, he is of the opinion that a salary of 800 Rials a month, rising by increments of 50 Rials a month every two years to a maximum salary of 1,000 Rials a month, with a bonus of twenty-five per cent, (see your letter P.Z.-6416|32 of the 22nd November 1932) and Noruz Gratuity should be adequate. 3. I am, therefore, to request that the Secretary of State for India may be moved to approve these proposals and, in view of the considerations urged in paragraph 16 of Mr. Hoare’s despatch, I am to request the favour of an early reply to this letter. 4. A similar letter has been addressed to the Treasury. Sub-Enclosure to Serial No. (79). Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, No. 148, dated the 4th April 1933. I have the honour to report that it has for some time past been evident to me that the Oriental Chancery at this Legation is greatly under-staffed. 2. In 1928, Ibe total staff consisted of : 1 Oriental Secretary (Mr. Havard), 1 Head of Oriental Chancery (Abbas Quli Khan Nawab), 3 Munshis. .compared to the present-day staff of : 1 Acting Oriental Secretary (Mr. Trott), 2 Munshis. 3. I deliberately omit the Assistant Oriental Secretary' from the present establishment because during the last five years the Oriental Secretary and the Assistant Oriental Secretary have in practice never been at Tehran together, and because it is equally clear that Mr. Summerscale or any other officer who fills the post will spend most of his time in acting appointments, either in Tehran or elsewhere. Moreover, even the permanent services of an Assistant Oriental Secretary would go a very little way towards meeting the difficulty with which 1 am now concerned—the inability of the present two Munshis to cope adequately with the routine work of translation, press-reading, etcetera. 4. I may preface my T further comments on these points by submitting the following table of correspondence with the Persian Government during the last six years :— Received. A Despatched. Received and Despatched. Total Year. Official. Private.} Total. r Official. Private. Total. 1927 .. 265 187 452 321 176 497 949 1928 .. 287 113 400 337 163 500 900 1929 .. 435 114 549 500 147 647 1,196 1930 .. 453 76 529 485 68 553 1,082 1931 .. 497 61 558 577 73 650 1,208 1932 .. 578 52 630 633 112 745 1,3755. This shows an increase of about forty-five per centum since 1927. fi. In his despatch Xo. 433 of September 8th, 1930, in which mv predecessor agreed to the ieduction of the number of munshis to two, he explained that the use of semi-official letters in French tended to reduce the work of the Oriental ^ Chancery. A good many such letters are still sent, both in French and English (though not so many as when Teymourtache, as Minister of Court, dealt with foreign affairs generally) but their use (or to be precise, their use without accompanying translations into Persian) has had to be largely dropped in cases where reference through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to other departments is required : it was found that unless Persian translations were annexed consider able delays and misunderstandings arose, no doubt owing to the fact that the original letter was sent on by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs without transla tion to the other department concerned, or else that the Ministry simply passed on an insufficient summary of their own. The decrease in the number of letters sent in English or French only, and the consequent increase in the number of translations is, however, not nearly large enough to account for a rise of thirty per centum in the number of translations since 1930 when the post of third Munshi was abolished. The cause of this rise must rather be sought in the general increase in correspondence with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 7. Another important routine duty of the Oriental Chancery is the study and, where necessary the translation, of the Persian press. The third Munshi, when there was one, used to spend most of his time on this work. In his despatch of 1930, referred to above, my predecessor relied in this connexion upon the fact that the “ Messager de Teheran ” published daily extracts in French from the Persian press. These translations still appear but they do not lighten the work of the Oriental Chancery to any great extent. The translations are usually the briefest summaries, except in the case of articles of outstanding importance. The Persian papers have to be read as carefully as ever and articles of interest translated in full. During the recent Anglo-Persian oil Company crisis, for instance, the Acting Oriental Secretary, who should be free to devote himself to much more imx&gt;ortant work, has had to spend much time personally making translations from the press. 8. Another aspect of the Munshi’s work which has greatly increased is the translation of Persian laws and regulations. The output of the Mejliss becomes greater year by year and very few of the laws or regulations appear in any other language than Persian. This duty entails a careful study of the official Gazette of the Ministry of Justice and the proceedings of the Mejliss, and this study in itself takes time. More than once during the past year the Munshis (owing solely, I am convinced, to the pressure at which they have to work) have failed to detect, or at least to detect the importance of, a measure which was seriously to affect British subjects or of general interest to the Legation (a particular case I have in mind was a law for the commutation of pensions). 9. Other duties which fall to the Oriental Chancery are the operation of the Legation postal account and the general supervision of the clearance of consign ments addressed to the Legation from the Customs. Jhe first, involving the re-addressing in Persian, weighing and stamping of all outgoing postal coires- pondence, is a wearisome task that is left to a head Chancery ser\ant in most Missions. Here it is impossible. The clearance of customs consignments, owing to the complicated regulations regarding licenses and the constant difficulties that arise in even the simplest cases, is still more tiresome ; the applications ioi licenses are made by His Majesty’s Consul, who has gencial chaige of such matters, and the consignments actually brought fiom the customs-house b\ ghulams but it is the Munshis who have to keep the rostei of licenses and check off those that are used ; this, coupled with the constant telephoning to the Licensing Section of the Department of Commerce and the Customs Administici- tion takes up a great deal of time. 10. On lop of all this, the Munshis are subject to constant interruption in their work by Persian visitors who have business of one kind or another with His Majesty’s Legation. 11. I have so far dealt only with routine work, but the Munshis, or at any rate the Munshi-Bashi, have important duties of a more general kind. The Munshi-Bashi has frequently to interview government officials more especially in the Ministries of Finance and Justice, and at Police headquarters, about cases in which the Legation is interested and to collect information upon constitutional and legal points generally and upon the interpretation ot nev lavs and regu a- tions. The Munshi-Bashi ought really to be entirely free tor this sort ot work, Lc333FD98 •mi ■ and for such tasks as keeping a full and up-to-date record of Persian perso nalities, as was done in the past but cannot be done adequately to-day. 12. Furthermore, the Munshis have a certain amount of work to do for the Military Attache, who has no Munshi of his own. Particularly since restrictions have been placed upon visits by foreign Military Attaches to the Ministry of ^ War, the Munshi-Bashi has often been to interview the Chief of Staff and other officers.on the Military Attache's behalf. 13. The Commercial Secretary has a Munshi, but in addition to such trans lation work as the Commercial Secretary requires, he does most of the Com mercial Secretariat typing, registering, etceteia, and probably works longer hours than anyone in the Legation. It is therefore quite impossible for him to give any assistance to his colleagues in the Chancery. * 14. When the reduction of the number of Munshis from three to two was agreed to by mv predecessor in 1930, it was thought that the cessation of work connected with* the foreign tribunal of the Ministry of Finance might reduce the Munshi’s work proportionately. (This point is not specifically dealt with in Sir ft. Clive’s despatch No. 433 of 1930, referred to above, but it was one of the arguments used in earlier correspondence.) This hope has not, I fear, been fulfilled in its entirety. His Majesty’s Consul has no Munshi of his own, although the consular work is heavier here than at most provincial posts (and grows heavier with the successive closing of posts near Tehran, even though these are amalgamated with yet other provincial posts) and although he does not require the services of the Munshis as much as when the tribunal was in existence, he cannot help calling upon their services fairly frequently. Moreover, in a general way, the abolition of the tribunal is set off by the increasing number of cases in which British subjects (largely Indians, but recently Europeans also) are the subject of arrest and judicial action by the Persian authorities. 15. I can therefore state that there is in my opinion urgent need for the appointment of a third Munshi and I trust that sanction may be granted for the engagement of a suitable man forthwith. 16. The probable closing of His Majesty’s Consulate-General at Isfahan may afford the opportunity of engaging Mirza Hedayatullah Khan ftahnama. He is reported to me to be a very reliable and hard-working official, with a very good command of English, and though I am not sure that he would wish to come to live in Tehran, 1 should be glad of the opportunity of offering him the appoint ment. 1 should consequently be glad if I might receive a reply to this despatch by telegram. 17. The salary which I recommended is Rials eight hundred and fifty—fifty (every two years)—one thousand a month, with the usual Noruz gratuity, plus the twenty five per centum increase granted to the other two Munshis. His present salary, it is true, is only Rials seven hundred, including a temporary allowance of Rials one hundred a month, but the cost of living is so much greater in Tehran that he could not exist on less. 18 19 20 18. I particularly hope that it may be possible to make the post of third Munshi a regular appointment, that is to say that, while the post would not be regarded as any more permanent than the rest of the Legation establishment, and while the man himself would have no guarantee of continuous employment, the post should not be the subject of constant review, which would only take place if the work of the Oriental Chancery obviously decreased to a substantial degree for two or three years at a time. Unless some sort of assurance e continuous employment can be assumed it is practically impossible to obtain a good man. 19. I may add that the present establishment leaves no margin at all f°J leave or sickness : and while it is always possible for two men to do the work o three for a short time, it is very much more difficult for one to do the work ot two. Except for the usual public holidays, neither of the two Munshis. have bee absent from the office for a day for over two years—the Munshi-Bashi for nea U three. The second Munshi is feeling the strain and has just applied to me t six weeks’ leave on medical advice. It is going to be very difficulty to carry o at all during his absence. 20.

Despatch prom H.s Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London Fo. 110, dated the 17th March 1933. I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a most interesting report by Mr. J. P. Summerscale upon the state of agriculture in Fars. 2. The picture is not a cheerful one, and shows that the increased efficiency in general administration which the Pahlavi regime has undoubtedly brought about has failed to icmove the sense of insecurity (both physical and moral,\s Mr. Summerscale points out) from which the Persian peasant has always suffered. The only difference seems to be that the sense of insecurity has spread to the landlord, who seldom has the means, if he has the will, to develop Ids estates. 3. A slightly different picture is presented by certain parts of the north, if the experience of some members of the great Hamadani land-owing family of Qaragozloo is any guide. Their peasants, they say, are completely out of hand, and appeal to the police and the law courts at every turn whenever the landlord attempts to assert his rights or declines to sanction some extravagant improve ment. . This may be true, but, if it is, the material advantage that the peasant gains is not obvious, judging from the incredible raggedness of their clothes. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the acting British consul at Shiraz (No. 7). Enclosure to Serial No. (81). Memorandum on the State of Agrioullture in South Persia, particularly in the Province of Fars. AGRICULTL RE, which is the main resource of the country, is at present very backward ; it ought and could be a means, not as now of mere existence, but of prosperity. Large-scale methods and elaborate modern machinery are neither necessary nor desirable to achieve this. More plentiful water supply and greater security are the main determining factors. At present it is estimated that about one-third of the available w T ater supply is utilised. One-third is allowed to run to waste, and one-third more could be obtained by lengthening and cleaning qanats.” This essential improvement, and indeed all progress, is pre vented originally by the land-owning system—absentee—landlordism with on long-sighted view. The owners wall not spend a penny on improvements. The peasants, who are not proprietors, might possibly—though not very probably— be interested in improvements if it w 7 ere not for insecurity of tw T o kinds : (a)100 actual physical insecurity—depredations by the military or by robbers ; (b) insecurity as regards taxes and unjust assessments and certainty of unjust treat- merit by the landlord’s agent. In these circumstances pi ogress is not possible. Ti ie on iy hope of progress lies in peasant proprietorship plus security. This could be secured by legislation, the creation of an agricultural bank, both backed bv a longsighted and disinterested Minister of Agriculture together with just taxation antf real security. From the present regime this seems improbable. The majority of che Majlis consists, in fact, of “ absentee landlords ” interested in the maintenance of their estates. The condition of the peasant to-day is much worse than, say, even five years aoo One hardly sees a single villager who is not clad in rags ; their hovels are pitifully destitute of any semblance of comfort or even decency. Their cattle are on the verge of starvation ; they themselves look under-nourished, spiritless. Still they are patient, surprisingly jovial and kindly. Their one “ luxury,” tea and sugar, is now so dear as to be well-nigh unbuyable. The repercussion of the misery of the peasants is clearly seen in the towns, c.17., m Shiraz, ^iriz. Business has been extremely bad, and no amount of “local industrialisation ” so much in favour at present can improve conditions until the purchasing power of the peasant is raised. A slight improvement in 1933 over 1932 may be expected purely on grounds of better rainfall, but the fundamental prosperity of the country can only be affected by real reforms. Taxation is high and the proceeds thereof are largely transferred to Tehran; very little is used for the benefit of the south. The Mamassani country, in which the Shah has recently founded the new town of Tol-i-Khosro, to be settled by tribespeople, is a most fertile and promising region, but significantly it was better worked a f ew years ago than now, and under present conditions the- peasants show few signs of wishing to develop that region. Around Lake Niriz a certain amount of Government encouragement has led to the extension of the cultivated area, but on a very small scale. In recent vears the Jews of Shiraz have tended to displace the original Per sian landowners. The change is for the worse. Even more grasping than the owners thev displaced, the Jews, never distinguished as agriculturalists, are equally short-sighted as regards general policy. Two important villages which have fallen largely into the hands of Jewish merchants are Sivand and Zarghoun. The effect of the opium monopoly on the prosperity of Fars is also a factor of importance. Although the monopoly was terminated in November 1932, the retention of a heavy export tax still crippled the opium trade. Turkey and Russia benefit by Persia’s policy. The year 1933 is looked upon as holding hopes of better times than 1932. The improvement, if realised, can only be relative. A -walk through any village in the neighbourhood of Shiraz w 7 ould convince an observer of the immense scope for improvement. The only villages with any semblance of a decent standard ot living seem to be those in the neighbourhood of Persepolis, where the men can supplement their earnings by working on the excavations.

WITH reference to my telegrams Nos. 53 and 54 of the 14th and the 16th March (not received) respectively, I have the honour to report that His Majesty Jj consul at Tabriz has since telegraphed that the Soviet organisations there nail probably be reduced to a mere cadre by the 25th March. I have not received news of any similar situation arising either at Meshed or Resht. 2. Despatches since received from Mr. Palmer furnish more details of the local situation and the anxiety felt by merchants who have sold goods on credi to the Soviet trade organisations. It is feared that the merchants may either lose their money or at best be offered the return of the goods. It may safe!} % presumed that such trade debts all over the country represent a considerable sum, as there must be a great many long-term bonds—anything up to twelve months- - falling due in the near future. The sum of 15 miliion rials is mentioned as 1 approximate total due to the Persians.

Note by His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, No. 173, dated the 10th April 1933. With reference to my note No. 169 of the 7th April last (Farvardine 18th) respecting the affairs of Mr. Townshend-Smith, I have the honour to inform Your Highness that it has just been brougllit to my notice that during the course of the last few days the coal-mine belonging to Mr. Townshend-Smith at Garmabdar has been visited by Government Officials, who have closed the mine and brought all the workmen to Tehran. 2. I feel obliged to protest vigorously against the arbitral interference with the commercial affairs of a British subject. The fact that Mr. Townshend-Smith is suspected by the police authorities of having contravened the laws against espionage and the export of gold can have no connexion whatever with the com mercial business of coal-mining : nor, I am convinced, can any legal justification be found for such a step, 3. I shall accordingly be glad if Your Highness will take urgent measures to ensure that all restrictions upon the operation of Mr. Townshend-Smith’s coal mine are immediately removed and that the production of coal from this mine arsd its sale in Tehran and elsewhere are allowed to proceed freely under the direction of whatever person Mr. Townshend-Smith may care to appoint to repre sent him during the period of his detention. 4. I shall be glad to receive the earliest possible information regarding the steps taken in Ihis matter by Your Highness. 5. J have, furthermore, the honour to request that Tour Highness will arrange for Mr. Townshend-Smith to be visited by Mr. A. C. Trott of this Lega tion during the course of tomorrow, Tuesday, April 11th (22nd Farvardine) in order that Mr. Trott may discuss with him the situation caused by the closure ot his mine. T avail myself of this opportunity to renew' to Your Highness the assurance of my highest consideration. Tc333FDEnclosure No. 2 to Serial No. (83).

With reference to my note No. 173 of April 10th (Farvardine 21st) respecting the affairs of the coal-mine belonging to Mr. Townshend-Smith, I have the honour t 0 inform Your Highness that I now learn that the mine in question is being operated without interference. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Highness the assurance of my highest consideration. (84) Despatch from British Hegation, Gtulhek, to the Foreign Office, Dondon, No. 256, dated the 1st June 1933. With reference to my despatch No. 237 of May 20th [Serial No. (60)], respect ing the arrest of Messrs. Townshend-Smith and Parsons, I have the honour to transmit to vou, herewith, copies ot a long explanatory note that I ha\e now received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and of my reply. You will observe that FeroughPs explanations, though couched in polite and even conciliatory language, do not really explain anything at all. 2. Previous to the receipt of this note Mr. Trott had had a further interview withlhe Minister of Justice at which he gave His Excellency additional details of the circumstances of Mr. Parsons’ detention, on the lines of the statement of which I enclose a copy. Daver admitted that there were many points which re quired clearing up and promised to send for Mr. Parsons and confront him with Kamran, the examining magistrate. Mr. Trott suggested that he too might be present, but Daver did not seem to relish the suggestion. The latter sent for Mr. Parsons on May 28th, but Kamran, though waiting outside, was not brought into the room while Air. Parsons was there. Daver produced the dossier and asked Air. Parsons to state whether his signature in a certain place was genuine or not. He said it was. Daver then read out the statement above it which was an order of the 8th Section of the Parquet of the Court of First Instance ordering Air. Parsons io be detained while a charge of espionage against him was being examined. Air. Parsons was positive that no such statement had ever been read out to him. Underneath this statement was the question “ Have you ever been a spy or not ? ” and the answer “No ”. Air. Parsons agreed to this. Underneath was a record of the fad that Air. Parsons wished to make an appeal, but the appeal itself was not attached. Air. Parsons said that four days later he had signed a document that he thought was his appeal, and Daver said that he would make enquiries. 3. Air. Parsons then asked to be allowed to look at the dossier and found that the date against each of the above statements or questions and answers was ihe 25th ; Daver had always assumed this to be the 25th Esfand, that is to say three days after the 22nd Esfand (Alarch 13th) when Air. Parsons had been arrested, and had always maintained that the investigation had taken place and the chaige communicated three days after Air. Parsons’ arrest. The latter at this point removed a pin that passed over a part of the date and it was discovered dial die date was in reality the 25th Farvardine, not the 25th Esfand, so that the examina tion in question had taken place thirty-three days instead of three days otter Air. Parsons’ arrest. This discovery gave Daver a great shock and he promise to make further and serious investigations. 4. The Afinister of Foreign Affairs sent the Head of the English Sectio^ Alirza Alohammed Khan Shayesteh, who has succeeded Jelal to see me on the -• Alay. He explained all this with every sign of embarrassment, which lor so c reason did not seem t o be relieved in any way when I told him that we had ulrea y heard it from ther Alinister of Justice, through Air. Parsons. However, it undoubtedly a sign of grace that Shayesteh should have been sent to make apology. 5. Air. Parsons wishes to make a claim against the Persian Government or wrongful imprisonment. I presume that a claim cannot in any case be ' until the case has been disposed of, either by his trial or by a decision ol the P ^ prosecutor not to proceed further, and then only if it can be shown that the a ^ ritics acted in the first place without just and probable cause. This nng ^ rather difficult; to establish, but a claim in respect of the separate issue o ^ unnecessary length of his detention might be easier to pursue now that t 0 ‘ of thirty-three days in making known the charge has come to light- 1 sho 1mm 103 grateful for gmclauce as to the legal principles involved in a claim on either account. Mi. J a] ^ons is at present earning a few rials a day on odd jobs but no one will give him regular employment. J ’ 6. I have heard that Mr. Townshend-Smifh may be released soon on hail tor ten thousand lomans a significantly la rff e sum in comparison with the s m of two hundred and fifty Tomans asked for Mr. Parsons. I should have rhou.-ht i impossible for him to find anyone willing to guarantee this sum, but am told that Mi. Jones, t.ie manager of a local tannery, may be willing to do so. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India {^o. 109). Enclosure No. 1 to Serial No. (84). Note fkom _ the Peesian Minister for Foreign Affairs, addressed to His Majesty s Minister, iNo. 8806, dated Khordad 3rd; 1312 (May 24tii, 1933). r&lt; ' Ceipt r° f h 0Ur Exce } lene y’ s n °te of the 15th Ordibehesht (May 5th) No 2ol regarding the procedure m the investigation of the Towrishend-Smith anil arsons cases, 1 enquired from the quarters concerned concerning the com plaints which you made against the maimer in which the said investigations were conducted . it aanspires now that the facts of the case have not been correctlv communicated to you since the competent quarters assure me that important progress has been made m the examination and investigation of the case of Smith hut that there remain more investigations to be made which will be carried out with all possible speed. In connection with Your Excellency’s complaint regarding the delav of a tew da vs m providing the means of an interview between Mr. Trott and lownshend-Smith, according to the explanations which I have received I under- stand that the application for an interview was not refused on principle and that it lour Excellency has noted that some delay has occurred in the proceedings for the accordance of this request, it has been due to the irrevocable regulations of prisons and t can assure Your Excellency that the delav was not at all due to any evil intention. The authorities concerned have, moreover, been urged and recommended to expedite their action in respect of future applications for an interview-. In connection with Your Excellency’s expression of surprise at the fact that an accused person has remained for 38 days in a place of confinement without being examined, Your Excellency will obviously admit that on principle no time limu can be set to the duration of the preliminary investigations as the judicial officials (Zaboteen-i-Adlieh) are normally bound to extend the preliminary investigafions so far as is necessary for the discovery of the facts, and there seems to be no legal ground for the commencement of the actual trial’of the case before these investigations have been completed. The procedure of the pre- liminilry investigation, no matter to vdiat extent it may be expedited, will vary in duration of time for its completion according to the various cases at issue, and I cannot imagine that there exists any country, no matter how far its judicial system and means for the discovery of guilt may have been perfected, whose officials can assign a time-limit for the duration of preliminary investigations ; and even though a judicial system might claim that a forecast might lie made ot the limits of duration of time for the completion of preliminary investigations the circumstances and the means which might be used for the realisation of this forecast vmuld rightly arouse suspicion and anxiety. Therefore, if Your Excellency, under the circumstances, has been informed that the investigations will be completed in a week or twelve days’ time, the state ment has been based on a conjecture wdiicb has not proved to be practicable. In connection with the inferences that Your Excellency desired to draw from the intervals in the dates of the steps taken by the police authorities in their initiation of the investigations, in the searching of the house and in the eventual arrest of Townshend-Smith, I regret to say that I cannot agree with them because the intervals in themselves prove that the police authorities w-ere guided by caution and discretion and as far as possible did not take steps to ^arrest anybody before collecting evidence in support of their action. Following this method of action, if the police authorities have delayed the arrest of the accused person, there is no blame against them as the delay was only due to the fact that they w-ere collecting evidence wffiich cannot be construed as creation of evidence. Therefore if in the stage of preliminary investigations, that is to say the stage wdiich will have to be gone through for the discovery of facts before i104 the formulation of the actual charge and the commencement of the trial, we suddosc that the accused person has remained a few days without being cross- examined we should not presume that the investigations have been prolonged needlessly or that the arrest of the accused has been legally unauthorised because the investigations do not consist exclusively of the statements of the accused but ^ include those of other persons ; the moment that there is no need tor the confine- * ment of the accused in proceeding with the investigations and that some other sort of security can be taken from him, no hesitation will certainly be shown in setting him free. In respect of the other accused, Parsons, Your Excellency complained in your note No 231, concerning the delay in sending an answer to the questions made in his case and at a subsequent date you gave an account, m your note No. 239, of Mr Trott’s interview with him in the Qasr prison, lour Excellency is aware that it was arranged that the Minister of Justice should inspect the proceedings in the dossier of the case with a view to asccitaining whether, as imagined, Parsons* charge had not yet been announced to him. As a result of the inspection carried out it has unfortunately been pio\ed that some time alter the legally prescribed time his guilt (charge) vms clearly announced to him, i.e., three days after the date when he was arrested. Your Excellency will certainly perceive therefore that the statements made in the presence of Mr. Trott w T ere misinterpreted. Although the delay of three days was certainly irregular, the official in charge of the investigation delayed the definite announcement of Mr. Parsons’ guilt (charge) presuming that the questions that he put to Mr! Parsons on the first day of his arrest were sufficient to convey to him the nature of the charge against him. But at any rate the official in question explicitly stated to him three days after his arrest wdiat the charge against him v r as and the signature existing of Mr. Parsons on this announcement ot guilt leaves no room for any doubt. As to the interference of the examining magistrate in the presence ^ of Mr. Trott when Parsons said that he wanted to know ‘ wdiat the charge against him was ’ and the magistrate is reported to have said that Mr. Parsons * should not ask this question ’, I understand that the intention of the magistrate was only to say that wdien the accused person meets with others he should not discuss matters vdiich concern the investigatory dossier of his case and the point that “ in reply to a direct question of Mr. Trott, the examining magistrate added that the charges lying against Mr. Parsons have not been announced to him but that he knew' them.well ” evidently referred to the first day of his arrest and the first sitting of his examination because as already explained the explicit announcement of the nature of the charge w r as made to him three days after his arrest. In conclusion I have the honour to add that Your Excellency is doubtless awnre that Parsons has been set free on bail a few r days ago. In connection with Your Excellency’s statement that Mr. Parsons requested to see the British Consul, I have not so far been able to ascertain the definite date of this application, but in any case it wmuld have been proper tor him if Mr. Parsons did make such a request and it wms not accepted by the subordinate officials, to make the same application in writing to the Ministry of Justice. Enclosure No. 2 to Serial No. (84). Note by British Legation, Gulhek, No. 280, dated the 1st June 1933. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Highness’ note No. 8806 of Khurdad 3rd, .1312 (24th May 1933), relative to the detention in prison ot Mr. Townshend -Smith and Mr. Parsons. 2. 1 gladly accept Your Highness’ assurance that the delays that have occurred in these two cases are not the result of malicious intent and indeed 1 have never supposed that this w r as the cause ; but I am, on the other hand, unable to accept Your Highness’ suggestion that the facts that I have brought to your notice in support of my complaints are incorrect or based upon faulty information. I have throughout taken the utmost pains to establish the accuracy of any positn e statements that I may have made. 3. Your Highness will possibly not be surprised if I state that in my opinion the nature of the prison regulations cannot be regarded as furnishing any so of excuse for the fact that a delay of twelve days took place from the time w ien I first intimated that I desired a member of my staff to visit Mr. Townshen Smith in prison to the time when arrangements were made £or this visit to paid. If the prison regulations conflict with the obligations of the Impelisa 105 Government it is, I contend, the duty of the Imperial Government to change the regulations. But leaving this point aside, I cannot find that there is any provi sion in the existing regulations which can account for the delay. The regula tions give the competent authorities full discretion and I still fail to understand ^ why it should have taken twelve days to complete any necessary formalities. I note, however, that the said authorities have been urged to use greater expedi tion in future cases and I do not wish to labour the question at greater length on the present occasion. 4. With regard to the length of time that Mr. Townshend-Smith has been kept in prison without the investigations having been concluded, and the necessity or otherwise for his detention, I will only observe that the period has now increased from thirty-eight days to fifty-seven. I note with satisfaction that as soon as Ihe investigations have reached a point at which the detention of Mr. Townshend-Smith is no longer necessary, no hesitation will be shown at setting him at liberty, and I trust that now that a period of nearly two months has elapsed since his arrest and a still longer period since the search of his house, the officials in charge will be able to report that their investigations have reached this stage. 5. In the meanwhile, I should be glad of an assurance that a letter written to him by Mr. Trott on Khordad 1st, 1312 (May 22nd, 1933) has reached its destination. 6. With regard to the date on which Mr. Parsons was informed of the charge brought against him, I am glad to learn that on a further examination the Minister of Justice has satisfied himself that there was actually a delay of thirty- three days before any such communication was made or thought to have been made to him. I venture to invite His Excellency’s attention to Mr. Parsons' statement that a sentence which appears in the dossier over his signature to the effect (hat he was ordered to be detained on a charge of espionage was not read over to him before he affixed his signature, and that his request that the whole document be read to him before he signed it was refused. 7. As to the discussion about the communication of the charge that took place on the occasion of Mr. Trott’s visit, I can only say that the explanation now given by the examining magistrate is not in accordance with the clear impression retained by Mr. Trott of this part of the conversation. 8. I can inform Your Highness that Mr. Parsons applied to see the British Consul on the first day of his detention and again on the third day. I take note of the fact that Mr. Parsons should have addressed a written request to the Minister of Justice when his first request was refused by the police authorities, but I venture to enquire how Mr. Parsons was to know this if these same autho rities did not tell him so. It was clearly their obligation to do so. 9. I will not dwell further on the points in Your Highness’ note, as it is with the future rather than with the past that I am concerned for the moment. But I would again urge Your Highness most earnestly to use all your endeavours to secure an early termination of the investigations into the case of Mr. Townshend- Smith. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew' to Your Highness the assurance of my highest consideration. Enclosure No. 3 to Serial No. (84). Statement made by Mr. G. S. Parsons, to the Oriental Secretary, on May 18th, 1933. 1. On the 13th Mafch 1933, in the morning, representatives of the Police came to search my house. They carefully examined all my papers, and v-ere specially interested in the following tv^o documents : (1) A contract for carriage of the British Legation mail, dated several years ago, and (2) a picture taken from 4 The Sphere ’ in 1914, showing His Majesty King George and other rulers on one side, and the British Navy on the other. • 2. I was made to go to the police station and 1 was kept waiting there for most of the day. Finally in the evening I was brought before an officer of the police v r ho asked me various questions, mostly about my service as a chauffeur to the Head of the Protocol Section of the Ministry of Court (i.e., Amir Nizam Qaragozloo). I asked on this occasion to be allowed to see the British Consul but was told that this was impossible. At the beginning of the interrogation I was asked whether I could read and w-rite Persian. I replied no. I signed the Lc333FDroporri of my interrogation wherever I was told to : I asked whether a third person could be brought in to read over the written words, but this was refused. 3 1 was then shut up in a room which appeared to be an office. It was quite clean. 1 was kept there until the next day but one. 4. On the third day I was taken to the head of the fourth (Political) Section of the Police de Surete, named Kamran ; he tried to make friends with me. Without telling me what I was accused of, he said that he knew all about what I had been doin°- but that he was a friend of mine and all I had to do was to write down on a sheer of paper all I knew about it. In order to humour him I agreed, without knowing what he referred to, and he left we with ink and paper expecting me to write out a confession of something. He had promised that if I would make a clean breast of the matter he would get an immediate order from the General, or Head of Police, releasing me that very day. 5 Kamran came back in about an hour and was very annoyed to find that I had written nothing. I gave as my reason the fact that 1 was guilty of nothing. 6. Kamran then cross-examined me about several subjects. The principle thing about which he asked me was my relationship to Mr. Townshend-Smith. Did I know him 1 How many times had I seen him ? \\ hen we met what did we talk about ? What was Mr. Townshend-Smith’s business ? etcetera, etcetera. The record of the question and answer filled about twelve pages of foolscap. I am sure that nothing was said about my having been suspected of spying. On this occasion again I asked the Captain in the police office for permission to see the British Consul and was refused. 7. I was then shut up in the same room and was not interrogated again for about 28 days. 8. On about the 28th day from my arrest I was sent to ‘ Prison No. 2 ’, which is a prison slightly better than ‘ Prison No. 1 ’ which is reserved for murderers and important criminals. I was in solitary confinement in a small room, very dark, with one window and four blue lights in the domed roof. (By throwing stones I managed to break one of the blue lights and thereafter could see better. 1 had no exercise. The room was about one arm-span wide and two long, and about 4 yards high.) 9. On about the 30th day I was told that an order had been issued that I was to be imprisoned ; I saw the order, which was dated four days previously, but it was not read out to me. I asked why I was to be imprisoned—the reply was “ it is in connection with your case ”. Subsequently I was asked the ques tion “ Have you ever done any spying ? ” In answer I said “ For whom ? ” ; and when no answer was given I replied to the main question “ No ”. My answer was recorded in the dossier. Just previously Kamran asked me whether I appealed against the order and I replied that I did. At no time was a formal accusation communicated to me. 10. About four days later a paper was brought to my cell and the bearer said it was a copy of my statement of appeal. Although it appeared to me to be undated, I signed it. 11. Except for these occasions I was not interrogated at all. 12. After about 28 days in ‘ Prison No. 2 ’ I was removed to the Qasr-i- Qajar prison where I had a much better room and was treated better. The whole of my confinement was solitary. 13. During my imprisonment my wife was allowed to see me twice ; once^ while I was in ‘ Prison No. 2 ’ and once on about the 60th day. This was evidently a favour. My wife was interrogated while I was in prison. One of the questions which she was asked was “ Do vou know Mr. I)’Alton* and Mr. Walterf ? ”. 14. Kamran told me on one occasion that the police had been watching me for about a month before my arrest on March 13th. This agrees roughly with the date on which, I believe, a Persian who had a grudge against me sent a letter to Amir Nizam accusing me of being a British spv and which I suspect Amir Nizam passed to the police. 15. I was eventually told on the 64th day of my imprisonment that I could be released if T could find surety for 250 Tomans. I said that I could not do this irom prison. I was then released with an armed guard and taken to Tehran • on the 66th day I found the necessary surety and was set free. *Of the Imperial Bank nf Persia, Tehran. fPresmnably f)h e Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia at Isfahan.107 (85) Despatch vpom the Bbitxsh Legation, Oclhek, No. 265, dated the 2n„ J unr ' Imperial Ilank'^l’orsia customs^imunitv° f the attack on the todays’ date (not received) are I think of 111 my ,¥ eKram Xo ' 121 of fairly detailed report. ^ 01 sufficle &gt;*‘ S«ne&gt;al interest to merit a for FordgH Aif^ settled promptly, but I cTrtaiiUyfailed to do so and it , '.VT 1,(,t MiSHfFt^ ^ n0t ' haVing ^'Vthe matter SSl^M 3.

My view, in which Mr. Wilkinson con curred was that the method employed by Taghizadeh to communicate his wishes to tiie bank had been cavalier to the point of discourtesy and that it would be a eign of weakness to approach him. Mr. Wilkinson therefore confined himself to ^er lC1 i l ^/ Je ^ ac ^ s bo ' ore Prime Minister but so far as I am aware his repeated onorts to galvanize that veteran statesman into activity failed entirely. .. f- rp &lt;?tnmn conclusion which I draw is that the Shah’s Ministers are satis- aecl that His Majesty would be annoyed if they were responsible for an incident nhich once again threatened to disturb Anglo-Persian relations. But for this consideration I am sure that Taghizadeh who is painfully slow to reach a decision ami equally obstinate when he has done so, would not have surrendered without &lt;t tar lucre stubborn resistance. I am the more sure of this as the Director-Gen eral of (’usroms told me confidentially that on receipt of his instructions he pointed out to the Minister that the Bank’s rights were clearly defined. Another conclusion is that Taghizadeh is at present far the strongest influence in the -abmet and that his colleagues are afraid to tackle him except under exceptional pressure. My general conclusion is that, like the Chinese, the Persians have a tendency to yield to pressure but not to reason.

Sub-Enclosure to Serial No. (85). I have learnt with pleasure of the successful conclusion of the negotiation? recently held in Tehran between Your Majesty’s Government and the representa tives of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and I have just received in audience Sir John Cadman who lias given Me a personal account of his conversations with Your Majesty. His report of the views expressed by Your Majesty on the subject of the relations between Our two countries has given Me keen satisfaction as they are in harmony with My own views and with those of My Government in the United Kingdom.' Advantage will be taken by My Government of the presence in Eng land in the near future on leave of absence of My Minister accredited to Your Majesty to review the previous discussions for the conclusion of a general settle ment of outstanding questions in the hope that it may be possible for these dis cussions to be resumed in the autumn on the return of Mr.‘ Hoare to Your Majesty’s Court with the best prospect of a successful issue. I feel confident that Your Majesty’s personal help and guidance will on that occasion also be available to remove any difficulties which might arise. Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (85). Letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, dated the 1st June 1933. Merci beaucoup pour avoir bien voulu me communiquer copie du message de Sa Majeste Britannique qui, j’en suis convaincu, fera grand plaisir a mon Auguste Souverain. Quant a la question de la Banque, je puis vous confirmer ce que je vous avais dejaditquec’est simplement une question d’interpretation sur laquelle d’ailleurs Fattention du Ministere des Finances avait ete attiree par le Departement du Commerce. L’article en question a ete consideree comme pouvant etre interpretee dans Tun ou Fautre sens. Finalement on a decide de 1’interpreter dans le sens favorable a la Banque et on vient de m’apprendre qu’on a deja avise la Banque de cette derniere decision. Vous pouvez par consequent etre tranquille sur ce su]et Je vais d’ailleurs vous envoyer une note qui mettra la chose clairement au point. ( 86 ) Despatch from British Legation, Gulhek, No. 271, dated the 3rd June 1933- I have the honour to report that on May 29th the Council of Ministers issued a decree according to which exporters’ exchange was freed from all restrictions. The effect of this decree, following on the bill freeing the ia ^ of exchange which was passed by the Mejlis on February 14th last year (see nh, despatch No. 90 of February 24th 1932) is to remove for the time being all res n tions on the movement of foreign exchange in Persia. 2. The decision to remove the restrictions on exporters’ exchange 1°^^ on a rapid appreciation of the rial in terms of sterling, the rate having risen about one hundred and two to the pound at the middle of April to eighty-tv o109 T! oi /^ a - r - ^ 11S appreciation represented an appreciable loss on the con- sidera i e amount ol exporters’ exchange which had accumulated during the eco- noimc year at he prevailing rates, and as this surplus exchange was to be placed at The disposal ox the Government, the latter would in the ordinary course have suffered to mss. The high value of the rial also represented a considerable dimi- nu ion m le value in Persia of the revenue of the Government accruing from the ... 3. The freemg of export exchange is likely to be beneficial to the Banks, as if will a low them much more freedom of operation. The decree of the Council of Ministers became operative immediately, but it requires ratification by the Mejliss. 1 here is thus an opportunity to give the measure a trial of some three months, at (he end oi which time if it has proved satisfactory it will no doubt be ratified. i x ^ r 8 l,n ^ ers t 00 d G° vern nient do not intend placing the accnnm- iated holding of exchange on the market at the present time, as it is fully realised that to do c&gt;o might p r ecipitate a severe crisis. The Banks have received an assu rance that tfiey will be relieved of this exchange without loss. 5. r Jhe immediate effect of the decree was to cause a fall in the value of the rial m terms of sterling, the rate having immediately fallen to eighty-six and subsequently to eighty-nine. 6. Plie Chief Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia informs me that lie doubts whether the new measure will be in the best interests of the country as a v hole, since, from past experience, the demand for exchange has always exceeded the supply. Should a serious shortage result it would cause considerable incon venience, and there icmains a possibility that a system of control of foreign ex change similar to that adopted in 1930 will be introduced. Two questions which Mr. Wilkinson considers to be of considerable importance have yet to be decided. No aeeision has been taken as to the procedure to be adopted for recovering the foreign currency of unexpired exchange undertakings given by exporters. On the other hand, no instructions have been given to the Customs as yet to refrain from claiming from exporters their undertakings to sell exchange before handing them export certificates. Consequently the Customs continue to demand this undertaking, but as there is now no way of checking whether an undertaking to sell exchange has been fulfilled, there is nothing to prevent an exporter from re taining his exchang abroad if it suits him, and a flight of capital in the absence of any great demand for Persian products may manifest itself thus causing an in visible adverse trade balance. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade [O.T. (B) 105], tlie Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 114), and to His Majesty's Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 39). (87) Despatch feom British Legation, Gulhek, No. 273, dated the 3rd June 1933. I was received in private audience by the Shah this morning when I delivered the Message from Ilis Majesty the King, the text of which was contained in your telegram No. 85 of May 27th (not received). I had previously communicated its text to the Minister for Foreign Affairs who had acquainted the Shah with its substance. His Majesty therefore merely glanced at the sheet of paper on which the Persian translation had been written and remarked that he had read the Message and was very glad to have received it. He noted that negotiations for a treaty would be resumed in the autumn and enquired whether I myself would be responsible for these negotiations, to which I replied in the affirmative. 2. His Majesty seemed indeed to be delighted, and was in a most amiable frame of mind throughout the interview which lasted for three quarters of an hour. 3. His Majesty then addressed a few words of welcome to Mr. Mallet in the course of which he referred with considerable gusto to Mr. Bridgeman’s well known escapade. Mr. Mallet replied that he had been in Persia at the time of the Coup d’Etat, and conveyed that he did not intend to follow Mr. Bridgeman’s example. The Shah then led us to chairs. 4. Pie mentioned his pleasure at the settlement reached with the Anglo-Per sian Oil Company and so I reminded His Majesty that at my last audience, when I had brought Colonel Dodd with me to take his leave, His Majesty had expressed some doubt as to the intentions of His Majesty’s Government towards Persia and that I had strongly affirmed their anxiety for the best possible relations L0333FD i110 between our two countries. The Shall admitted that although the obvious inter ests of our two countries must be similar and therefore the policy of Great Britain should alwavs be to encourage a strong and independent Persia, he had nevertheless from time to time in the last few years been compelled to doubt whe ther His Majesty’s Government fully realised this obvious fact and whether their intentions towards Persia were really benevolent. Recent events terminating in &lt; the happy conclusion of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s agreement had led him to believe that all was, in fact, well and that we might now look forward to a period of friendlv co-operation. I answered that everything should point m tnat direction As regards the oil concession I wondered whether 11ns Majesty had read the comments in the English press many of which described the new agree ment as a catastrophe. The Shah replied that he was aware of what the press said but that *oo much importance should not be attached to such criticisms. No doubt the shareholders would get slightly less money than tormerly and it was inevitable that some of them would not be best pleased. On the other hand 1 mist realise that the Persians also had hoped for more satisfactory terms and that there were things in the new agreement which were not particularly sweet for them to swallow. On the whole, however, he was satisfied that a tair compro mise had been achieved. The d’Arcy concession was obviously out ot date and unfair to Persia, and the share-holders ought to realise that as long as the,r in come depended upon a document which both the Government and people of 1 ersia considered one-sided they had none too good a security for their money. Now at the cost of slightlv reduced dividends they would enjoy security. I observed that the essential thing was that the Company were convinced that with goodwill on both sides prospects for the future were good. 5 At this moment the thread of the discussion was somewhat interrupted by a servant bringing in cups of tea and by His Majesty discovering to his annoyance that an immense silver cigarette box on the table was empty. The conversation was resumed on a different tack. The Shah asked Mr. Mallet whether he was able to talk Persian and Mr. Mallet repUed in that language that he was doing Ins best to pick it up again, and that he was delighted to be back in this country ot which ho had such pleasant memories. The Shah hoped that Mr Mallet realised that things had changed, hinting that the “ bad old days ” of British interference were at nn end. Mr. Mallet replied that His Majesty need not be afraid, a* ho was progressive in his ideas and greatly admired the work which had been achieved here in recent years. Moreover, having been m the army h™selt he could appreciate the value of discipline which had been instilled into the natnn. The Shall replied that this was all to the good as Mr. Mallet would realise that soldiers had to work for the independence of their country. Mr. Malle . marked that he was also able to appreciate the importance of a soldier^ Dem„ loyal to his sovereign, to which His Majesty replied with a sardonic grin tna depends upon the sovereign ” ! G. The conversation then turned to the question of trade. The Shah remind ed me that he had recently given several contracts to British hrms ano i shortly to give several more. I expressed my pleasure at this fitment of which would be of mutual advantage to our countries. It had occui ■ to me that the development of transport along the newly-opened Rowanet &gt; from Tabriz to Mosul, might greatly further the commercial mtorests ot d countries. The Shah assented and expected the north-western distnct tc fit largely by this road. 7. I then told His Majesty of my recent tour through Gilan and where I imd been struck by the prosperity of the Caspian coast ^'luch see c rue greater Ilian that of the plateau. The Shah remarked that the P e P t had' been more prosperous a few years ago, evidently meaning tnat re . action of the Soviet Government had harmed these provinces. He wa. c - to develop the towns on the coast and provide proper hotels there, ana ^ other parts of the country; unfortunately you could build a good hotel * ml put a Persian in charge of it, in a very short time it went to pieoes. i tn ‘ ^ to the presence in Tehran of Mr. Shaker of the International Wag c ' , t j ie par.y who was discussing with representatives of the Persian Gove o t establishment of hotels at various places of interest ; I added that 1 e( j wish to undertake this work without Persian participation, me Mia 6 that this was a good idea. 8. I then asked after the health of the Crown Prince who is now in land and expressed the hope that he was doing more play than w°rK. ^ t v indicated some slight fear that this might he the case. The mention oi111 affoided Mi.

I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Gov- ernment ol India (Ao. 115) and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (J\0. 4UJ. ° ( 88 ) (Received on 8th July 1933, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 25, dated 22nd June 1933.) Despaich irom H. M. s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 17, dated THE 14th January 1933. [E G14j614|34] His.Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of Slate for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the annual report on military affairs in Persia for the year 1932, compiled by the military attache at this Legation. Enclosure to Serial No. (88). Annual Report on Military Affairs in Persia for the year 1932. (A)— Army. General. The Shah continues to interest himself in every detail of army administra tion. Practically every day he visits the Ministry of War, the arsenals or the bniracks. As these inspections are carried out without previous warning, and at any hour of the day, the units of the Central Garrison have always to be prepared for a thorough and unexpected inspection by their Commander-in-chief, whose methods of showing his displeasure are direct and drastic. During His Majesty’s periodical tours throughout the length and breadth of Persia, the army is his chief concern, that is to say, after he has dealt with matters connected with his own personal estates. Funds are always made available for any expenditure required by the Ministry of War, and the military receives preferential treatment in every way. In consequence, the moral of the army is naturally high, but as militarism is being forced on a peace-loving nation, and on account of the peculiar nature of the Persian character, the result is unfortunately an excessively arrogant attitude towards others and an inordinate conceit of themselves. Training continues to improve and become more practical. Amongst the troops of the Central Garrison this reaches a much higher standard than in the provinces, but throughout the army training for war is carried out on a system and in a manner which could scarcely have been hoped for three or four years ago. The cavalry and infantry are well equipped, but the artillery remains obsolete and out of date. Arrangements for the purchase of modern artillery are in hand, but for some reason, probably on account of the present monetary exchange difficulties, this matter is being very much delayed. Transport is also urgently required, asi the pernicious system of com mandeering private transport is still the only means of transporting troops and war material in emergency. The question of equipping the air force has been settled, and, as is noted elsewhere, a large number of modern aircraft have been purchased.112 The construction of new barracks is being undertaken on a large scale in Tehran and the provinces. An even stronger order than before was issued forbidding all ranks of the ar my from having any intercourse or social dealings with any type of foreigner. This order is the result of the Shah’s suspicions that his army, on whom he relies f for his position, may be affected by subversive foreign influences, and it must he remembered that a large number of officers and nearly all the men are uneducated and of a rather primitive type. Chiefly as a consequence of the above order, a strong anti-foreign feeling is bein&lt;r created in the army. The Persian character lends itself to influences which pander to self conceit and arrogance, and there is much propaganda in the army on these lines. Unfortunately, the Shah’s example has produced a system of discipline based on severe punishment, and all tianimg appeals to be taught by threats and acts of severe chastisement. Estimates. The budget allotment for the Ministry of War for the year 1932-33 was 181,689,980 rials. This amount was not sub-divided into separate grants for the various services, but 160,179,980 rials are shown as a total for the upkeep of the army, air force, arsenals, the travelling and study expenses of service students, and expenses connected with naval and military foreign advisers. The sum of 21,500,000 rials was apportioned to the upkeep of the Amnieh (road guards or gendarmerie). In previous years the allotment for this force has been included in the budget of the Ministry of the Interior. The allotment for the Persian navy was not given under the budget heading of the Ministry of War but included in that of the Ministry of Finance, and details were not made available to show the exact sum allotted for this purpose. For the above reasons a comparison with last year’s figures is somewhat difficult, but approximately the total grants are the same, namely, some 48 per cent, of the estimated national revenue. On the 17th March the Majlis passed a Bill allowing a special grant of £1,500,000 from the Government reserves abroad for “ completing the equipment of the army with modern material.” The second part of this same Bill stated that the 6 million tomans allotted for the same purpose in 1929-30 should he considered as the equivalent of £1,200,000. It is not yet known how the above large amount is to be spent, but the purchase of aircraft, artillery, armoured cars and motor transport will almost certainly be effected. New barrack construc tion, which is now being undertaken throughout Persia, may also be expected to be a large expenditure. Organisation. The Order of Battle of the Persian army has not altered noticeably, the only . change of any importance being that the Asterabad Brigade has been abolished and the command reorganised into two units—the Asterabad Independent Regiment and the Turkoman Sahra Independent Regiment—the latter with headquarters at Gumbad-i-Kabus. A new establishment, under the name of the Inspectorate-General of the Army, was formed at the Ministry of War. It is nominally subordinate to the Chief of Staff, and treated as a branch of the General Staff rather than a separate organisation. Amir Lashkar Amanullah Mirza, Jehanbani, on his return from a two years’ staff course in Paris, was appointed as the first inspector-genera, assisted by seven inspectors, as follows :— Of artillery. Of cavalry. Of aviation. Of armament and equipment. Of supply and transport. Of musketry. Of medical services. Conscription. The budget allotment for conscription is a sub-heading under the grant to the Ministry of the Interior, and is 350,000 rials, an increase of 50,000 rials (h last year. . .. .. -113 last year, continuesfand ^teps 6 have^n^aken^ 8 il !. c “ nsc t ri P t , ion . as reported |* olls ^®r&lt;rposled t ca &lt; lli^ e up 1 an^ma , les C of l a C cert^ain IgTa^ela^’ bU ‘ Pr ° Clama - Armament and Equipment. ^ exception of the artillery. n ° W anne(1 antl e( l ul Ppe&lt;l on modem lines with the of 1929 and^bcfjiii^grfmo must haTe^been al' 0 ^ ks , at Briinn at the eil&lt;i aud as far as can be ascertained the CVoph i rr !° s en .^rely completed by now, of all garrisons and units.

On this occasion no foreigners except tiiose m Persian Government employ, were invited to attend. During the’parade vvinch was conducted on the same lines as last year, some 10,000 troops of the L/entraJ Garrison were inspected and then marched past, after each ami had staged a small military display. The general training of the army continues to improve, and field parades and musketry are now a regular and important part of the annual training. A rsenals. As far as is known the two arsenals, one in Tehran and one at Par chin, .j mi les south-east of Tehran, have been functioning on normal lines throughout ine year. The Shah continues to take a personal interest in these establishments, and new buildings, particularly in the Tehran arsenal, have been constructed. Further equipment will presumably be acquired for both arsenals from the special grant allotted last March for military purposes. Herr Hartmann, who had been responsible for building and equipping the powder factory at Parchin, and had also been in charge of the Tehran arsenal -or some years past, wms suddenly and unexpectedly dismissed in May and left Lc333FDPersia accompanied by ten or twelve other Germans who had been employed under him. p ers i an official with Herr Hartmann, wa 6 t WrW and a small Czechoslovakian mission was engaged to controftSe scientific side of the work.

The annual allotment for the upkeep of this force was 21,500,000 rials, an Increase of 1,490,000 rials over last year. The Amnieh continue to do most useful work, but as they are employed .almost entirely in small scattered detachments throughout the country their work is not spectacular. The escort duty which they are frequently called upon to undertake has been more dangerous than usual during the past year and they have suffered considerably at the hands of the Lurs and highway robbers in South Persia Military Operations. The only serious outbreak during the year was that in Luristan. The Pro vinces of Azerbaijan and Rezaieh (Urumia) were quieter than they have been for many years past. No further trouble was experienced in Kurdistan after the termination of the operations against Jafar Sultan at the end of 1931. In South Persia, Pars, Khuzistan, Bushire and the Gulf Ports have all been suffering from partial famine conditions on account of the lack of rain and the consequent failure of the harvest. Raiding and highway robbery increased in these areas, but did not call for the employment of troops on any large scale. A column of some 800 troops from Shiraz, under the command of Sarhang Hussein Khan, Pur Rastigar, toured the districts of Dashti, Tangistan and Shibkuh to deal with local disturbances and to carry out the disarmament of the tribes. They returned to Shiraz in July without having achieved any noticeable results. In November a detachment of some 500 men was sent from Shiraz to Ardekan to deal with a small revolt led by Ali Khan, Qashgai, a half-brother of Soulet-ed-Dowleh. In the southern area of Persian Baluchistan the tribal leader Abdul Hussein of Remishk has been in revolt for some time past and receives considerable sup port from the neighbouring tribes. The area of his activities, Bashkird, is the wildest and most undeveloped district in Persia. In the early Spring of 1932 a force of 2,000 all arms, concentrated from the garrisons of Khwash, Bam, Bunder Abbas and Kerman, under the command of Sarhang Muhammed Khan, Nakhchevan, commanding the Baluchistan Brigade, returned to their peace stations, having, it was said, dealt successfully with the revolt. The rebellion, however, has not been quelled, and Abdul Hussein continues to raid freelj. An incident connected with this revolt was the capture of the town of Old Jask in August by a party of some 250 rebels, who besieged the garrison in the fort until the arrival of reinforcements from Bushire. Operations in Luristan. An autumn campaign warf undertaken against the Lur tribesmen. It has been a matter of some eonieeture why the Government has not previously dealt with this outbreak. The official policy for some time past has been to deport the Lurs to settlements in other narts of Persia. The villages and nomadic camps were rounded up bv troops ; it was to be expected that women and children were chieflv collected, and in this manner large parties of Lnr tribesmen were made homeless and desperate by the loss of their families and outlawed by the action of the Government. These have been successtullv raiding for some months past and have collected a large quantity of grain cloth and stores from ornes which have been regularly looted on the Dirfnl— Khorremabad—Burn.prd road. Two incidents of special importance were the kidnapping of a Party of officials including Hie Governor of Khorremabad. in July and the holding up of a large number of motor vehicles on the Hamadan— Kermanshah road on the 3rd September when three American consular representatives were temporarily captured by the tribesmen. Thu autumn campaign consisted of an enveloping movement. The Kermanshah Regiment and the Muzaffar Infantry Regiment, the Intter from the Kurdistan BiLmde with headquarters at Senneh, were employed to the north rad west A s'tromr detachment from Tehran, consisting of the Bahadur Peg.- tlrd Pp^ment 1st Brigade) and four squadrons of cavalry, one from Tach Sent of the Central Garrison, was sent to reinforce the permanent troop* in the area, namely, the Luristan Brigade, whose headquarters are at Khor- remabad.The commander of this brigade, Sarhang Mehdi Quli Khan Baksh superseded and Sarhang Haji Ali Khan, Kazm Ara, commanding W IvV ^ shah Regiment, was appointed to succeed him. ^ er nian- A detachment from Isfahan is also said to have taken part in the operations The total number of troops employed was approximately 7,000 under ib command of Sartiq Murteza Khan, and Sipah Bod (Marshal) Ahmed Agha Kb was in chief control, civil and military, of the whole area. ' 1 Jvnan Certain sources state that as many as thirteen aircraft are beino- emnW h based on Khorremabad, and that two or three of these have come to grief Tl ’ figures are, however, probably an exaggeration, but five or six aircraft are tamly at Khorremabad in connexion with these operations, and one or two nt Ahwaz. 0 at It is difficult to estimate the number of the rebels, but they may havp up to 3,000 under the leadership of Yadullah Khan, Bairanwand, whose father Ghulam Ali Khan, had been publicly executed in Khorremabad. The rebels consist very largely of the Bairanwand section, whilst the important Saigawand are more or less neutral. The Kakawand appear to be on the side of the Government, and have to some extent been armed in order that they may assist the regular troops on occasion. The Lurs have with them a senior ex-officer, Sarhang Gigu. This man some two years ago, was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for opium smuggling at Hamadan, but escaped from the Qasr Kajar prison and managed to'reach Luristan. The tribesmen' were very short of arms and ammunition at the commence ment of the operations, but are reported to have collected sufficient for their present needs from the conscript soldiers, who show no desire to fight and freely surrender their arms and equipment. Sartip Murteza Khan has now returned to Tehran and be’en given command of the following troops, which he has orders to equip and prepare as an expedi tionary force presumably to be used as reinforcements against the Lurs. All sources agree that the creation of this force has no connexion with the Anglo- 1 ersian Oil Company affair :— Two regiments of infantry (six battalions). One regiment of cavalry. Two batteries of artillery. These troops were still in Tehran on the 31st December. Personnel. Language Officers. Tv ° Indian army officers were on language duty in Persia during 1932. Laptam A. Boyes-Cooper was appointed'to Tehran and left on the 2nd October on completion of one year’s study. Captain J. Campbell, who was stationed in Istahan, left Persia for India on the 16th Kovember.

Vuth reference to your despatch No. 91 of February 6th last, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a despatch I have received from His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz regarding the delimitation of the Persian-Turkish frontier. _ 2. The agreements recently concluded between the two countries passed their first reading in the Majlis on March 19th. 3. I am forwarding copies of this despatch, without its enclosure, to :— His Majesty’s Ambassador at Angora No. 38-M. His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz, No. 8. (Enclosure in Serial No. 32). Despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, dated the 16th March 1932. TTith further reference to paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 15-Secret of March 3rd, in which I ventured to suggest that Mr. Acting Consul Davis migh with advantage visit Urumiah (in June) of this year, I now have the honour to report that the Turkish Consul-General assured me yesterday that the Com mission for the final delimitation of the frontier will begin work in June— presumably starting on the Little Ararat section. 2. Probably, therefore, the Commission will again make their headquarters at Bagchejik. 3. The two tracts to be ceded to Persia—one on the Salmas Province frontier and the other on the Urumiah Province frontier—would presumably Te dealt with last. 4. Zia Bey, who reached Tehran on the second day of Tewfik Bnshti Bey’s pourparlers told me that finally the Turkish Minister had been forced to say clearly, that tiu^Tm-ks had no intention of evacuating the tract they already Lc203FD :u- CL0SUR c |N INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S &gt; i L No [104 o iUL. 1933 JUL.1933 O Mi iP;occupied and that the Persians were told that they could “ Take or leave ’’ the terms offered. 5. Zia added, that the population along the Little Ararat section was pronouncedly anti-Turkish. 6 I gathered also from the Chief of Public Security that there were still a small number of Kurdish rebels hiding in the caves of the above district, but that they could no longer cross into Turkey and should not give so much trouble this year as last. 7 I met vesterdav M. Salavioff—the Russian Consul at Maku, who had been away when T visited Maku last November. He speaks a little^ English. He had little to say over the general aspects of the frontier rectification ; but volunteered the statement that it would help the Turks to exploit the Trebizond Route with comparative safety and that he \icved this futuie 1 urkish com-- petition with the Batum-Julfa route with alarm. T gathered that Turkish transit charges wore now only 1|4 per cent—but cannot be sure that I understood Salavioff’s scraps of English. . S Zia Bev is &lt;ming to Stambul for 2 months shortly—going via Batrnn ; but hoping to return via trebizond. He said that in summer Trebizond to Tabriz could be done in o days ! I then pointed out that recent travellers had experienced great difficulties with the military. To this Zia replied that travellers had to he escorted through the Military zone of Erzerum and that in the case of Reithnger his real nationality had been “ considered doubtful ” pd he himself was inclined to consider him a naturalized German Jew ! This despite his British Passport In anv case Zia considered him “ a suspicious character and was not surprised ” that he had been sent to Kars ami m all had been forced to take 13 days from Maku to Trebizond. 9. Zia Bev added that not very long ago the Persian Consul—T think he said at Erzerum—was stopped while travelling to Russia and bis baggage searched despite his Diplomatic Visa or Passport. “ He was found to be carrying a letter to Russia from his Soviet Colleague— which letter.contained photographs of the Erzerum forts.’* 10. I repeat what Zia told me, without comment ; hut it would seem tha travelling near the Eastern Turkish Frontier is not yet m the nature ot a sa pleasure excursion—even when armed with a Diplomatic \isa. 11.

In conversation with visitors who called to congratulate him gaid and upon the issue of the operations in Kurdistan, Sarhang Haji 1that these could hardly be so described, being but a punitive expedition against the tribes. The only difficulty had been the nature of the country, with the lack of roads through the mountains, whilst the temperature, usually of 18° degrees below zero, also proved a severe hardship. The Sarhang informed another visitor that correspondence had been seized in Ja^aiar Sultan’s village and hinted that it has afforded the Persian Govern ment some knowledge of the chieftain’s relations with officials and persons across the ’Iraq border. Another batch of 150 Kurdish prisoners and hostages, including Sayyid Dowleh, reached Kermanshah on March Gth under strong military escort, with 50 mule loads of rifles mostly old pattern and arms taken from the tribesmen. All these men were securely fastened with ropes and appeared to have suffered great hardships. They were herded together in a local garage pending the requisitioning of transport for their conveyance to the capital on March 9th, when they were sent forward in six lorries under strong guard and four officers. The total number of prisoners and hostages evacuated through Kermanshah is said to have amounted to three hundred, of whom eight died on the road and five whilst at Kermanshah. One of these men is said to have succumbed i to beatings after an unsuccessful attempt to escape. Five prisoners are reported to have been shot at Sarpol-i-Zohab as they were unable to march. It is stated that nine persons shown to have taken part iji the rising were hanged in Kurdistan. The last batch of prisoners was despatched to the Capital in requisitioned motor transport on March 19120th. All accounts stated that their treatment was most harsh and it would appear that the policy of open cruelty to the prisoners was deliberately adopted. (34) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the London Foreign Office, No. 256, dated the 24th May 1932. In continuation of my despatch No. 128 of March 9th last I have the honour to report that the activity of the Persian Police in arresting persons suspected of being Soviet agents has now been extended to British subjects. 2. Three Indian British subjects have recently been actually deported or order ed to leave the country. One of these men (Lai Chand Varma of Ahwaz) appeared on the available evidence which was mainly that he had given English lessons to the Soviet Consul, to be harmless and I therefore asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs to let me know the reason for his deportation. My enquiry elicited little except that he was definitely a Soviet agent and was plotting to damage the oil-fields of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Of the other two, one (Krishna, a motor driver of Tehran) has certainly behaved in a suspicious manner while the last (R. A. Wilkinson, also of Tehran) though probably harmless politically, has been guilty of certain irregularities in his private life. The cause of sus picion in his case also appears to be that he has given English lessons to various Russians, and I am taking such unofficial steps on his behalf as are possible in the circumstances. 3. Teymourtache recently informed me that the police had discovered the existence of a fairly extensive Soviet intelligence service. He went on to say that in a number of cases the organizers of these activities had been introduced to the Persian Government as the representatives of Soviet trade organizations by the Soviet Embassy which must have known perfectly well that they were nothing of the sort. The only redeeming feature so far as the Embassy was concerned was that when the Persian police discovered the real nature of the work on which these gentry were engaged the Embassy displayed no interest in the matter. Further evidence on this subject has been furnished by His Majestv’s Consul at Kermanshah who, in a confidential portion of his diary for the' month of April last supplies some interesting information regarding the activities of Soviet agents. I enclose a copy of this extract since it throws some light on the method of recruitment of such agents and on the type of information which they are expected to provide. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No.’ 108) and to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Traq (No. 63).Extract from Kcrmanshah Diart/ No. 4 for the month of April 1932. (Conimunicutod to II. M. Minister at Tehran and II. E. the Hitfh Commissioner, Baghdad only.) Soviets A pents Activities. Through the interest of a reliable friend of foreign and non-Persian nation ality, His Majesty’s Consul was able to get into touch with an informant who has furnished him with information, believed to be trustworthy. The informant is an Assyrian, native of the Urumieh district and a Persian subject. He knows Russian, having studied at the academy of Tambov, Arabic, Persian and Turkish. Up to four months ago he was settled at the Assyrian camp near Hinaidi and came to Persia with his family intending to open a small hotel at Qasr-i-Shirin. The venture was not proceeded with and he has now settled at Kermanshah where his son attends the classes of the American Mission- This man stated that he had been approached by agents of the Russian Consulate and had had an interview with Petroff, the Consul, who endeavoured to enlist him in his Intelligence service. Though he stated that he was not prepared to serve, Petroff asked him to reconsider his decision within the next fortnight and made him take down a long questionnaire of the information required. This questionnaire includes the following :— (1) ’Iraq Kurdistan. —Conditions amongst the tribes and attitude to the central government, with special reference to the termination of the British mandate. Progress of the activities of Shaikh Ahmad Barzan and whether the move ment has been fostered or is supported by outside influences, Biitish, etc. Prospects of movements and attitude of other tribes. Morale of the tribesmen, their military equipment and whether any of this has been furnished by the British. Results of lighting to date and losses on both sides. Feeling between Kurds and Assyrians. Questions on military and general conditions in Kurdistan, not only in ’Iraq but on the Turkish and Persian borders. (2) Assyrians. —Full information regarding conditions of the Assyrians in ’Iraq and particularly those in the Levies. Their relations with the British and Arabs and their intentions in the future. Conditions in the Levies, their pa&gt;, equipment and arms. Field for agents-provocateurs sent amongst these men. (3) ’Iraq Armij. —All information obtainable- Morale and attitude of the men, conditions of service, pay and equipment. (4) British Forces in ’Iraq. —Information as to their number, units, etc., especially with regard to the Royal Air Force and number and type of aeroplanes. Feeling of natives towards the British Forces. (5) Political. —Conditions in ’Iraq. How far people are satisfied vnth present state and whether recent movements against Government were spontaneous or organized and if so, by whom and on whose behalf. (6) Persia — Kermanshah. —Police system and activities. Number of working in police services and full information of their activities, especiall} \u regard to the plain clothes department. The British Consul does not escape the attention of his Soviets colleague^ The agent is asked for information regarding his movements at night, the n ^ ni , of the persons frequenting him and for the possibility of obtaining the con en of his waste-paper basket. The informant is required to proceed to ’Iraq to collect the above tion and to hold himself in readiness to accompany into ’Iraq . any R^ssi agent, entering the country by other than the regular routes. This would imp that the latter would not be in possession of regular papers. 35 (35) G S Despatch fuom His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the London Foreig Office, No- 247, dated the 24th May 1932. I have the honour to report that Dr. Rabindranath Tagore, has just S P^ a month in Persia as the guest of the Government. He landed at Busline i46 middle of April, and was met by a delegation of Persian men of letters, including a brother of l eroughi, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. After visits to Shiraz and Isfahan he reached Tehran towards the end of the month. At both Shiraz and Isfahan he was entertained lavishly. i f ‘ J ’ n 4 T° hl i ai 5 ? r ‘ ^ a £° 1 re s P ei A a fortnight of almost continual receptions and lectures attended by members of the Government and other leading Persians. In one of his lectures debvered after an audience with the Shah, he indulged in a panegyric of the Shah which, appeared to astonish even a Persian audience, lor the rest they have been irreverently described as being mainly about ‘ love, roses and nightingales, with some reflexions on the evilness of evil ’ the way to avoid the latter being to cultivate love and read his poetry. At the first lecture the vile of the So\iei Ambassador presented him with a bouquet of yellow roses. He seemed embarrassed and left the bouquet behind on the platform. Apart from this, the Soviet Embassy displayed no interest in his visit. He was entertained, howe\er, by the Afghan Ambassador and the Egyptian Charge d’Affaires. 3. The motive of the poet in visiting Persia (the idea originated with him) was probably, apart from an ordinary love of travel a desire to collect money for his school in Bengal. In this he was at any rate partially successful, as he is said to have received fifteen thousand tomans from the Shah, no doubt as a reward for the song of praise alluded to above- I also hear that he proposed that the Persian Government should send two Government students to his school, where he is going to open a Persian section and engage a professor of Persian brought from Buda-Pest. 4. The motive of the Persian Government in asking the poet to come as their guest was probably to add reclame to the party of Persians with whom he travelled. This party consisted of Dr. Dinsha (or Dimshaw) Jeejeebhoy Irani, a Bombay solicitor, with his sister, Dr. Minosher Homejf, a doctor of medicine, Mr. Burgor Aga, a Bombay architect, Mr. Kaikhorrow Fitter, with his wife, and Mr. Bustom P. Masani, the managing-director of a company called “ Persia Industrial and Trading Company Limited ” newly formed at Bombay to encourage trade with Persia. Mr. Kaihan, the Persian Consul in Bombay and the poet’s daughter-in-law were also of the party. 5. Mr. Dimshaw, or Jeejeebhoy, or Irani, as he was variously called, is apparently a Persian, as well as a British subject, and wore a Pahlevi hat. Like Dr. Tagore he gave a series of lectures on Persian history and literature. These were intersperse with many references to “ our beloved country ”. 6. Mr. Masani told a member of my staff that he was formerly a municipal commissioner in Bombay and manager of the Central Bank of India. He said that, though personally more interested in literature than commerce (he had a low opinion of Dr. Tagore’s poetry), the main object of the party was to ascertain for themselves whether the state of the country would justify their investing capital in it. On this point Mr. Masani, who seemed a sensible man, said that though he was favourably impressed with the degree of order and security and with the great decrease in anti-Zoroastrian feeling, he had come to the conclusion that the present restrictions on commerce rendered the invest ment of capital inadvisable. He was however working out plans for the estab lishment of a wool factory, a cotton factory, a plant for making tiles at Tehran, and a flour-mill. He thought his directors might agree to start work (in which case British machinery would be ordered) but certain difficulties, such as the Persian desire that any company formed should have 51 per cent, of its capital in Persian hands, have yet to be overcome. He wished, however, to have a certain number of Persian shareholders. Kaihan had tried to persuade him to stan large scale cotton cultivation in Khuzistan, but he thought this too ambitious, especially as his firm had no previous experience of the subject. 7. Mr- Masani also stated that there were three organisations in Bombay devoted to the improvement of relations with Persia : the “ Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund ” started some fifty years ago for the purpose of assisting Zoroastrians at Yezd, Kerman, etc., the “ Irani Anjuman ” of which Mr. Dinshaw was President : and the Iran League of which Mr. Fitter is the Secretary and which apparently maintains close relations with the ‘ ‘ Karun-i-Iran-i-Bastan ” (Lamp of Ancient Persia) a nebulous organisation run at Tehran by a Persian called Saif-i-Azad (who is not a Zoroastrian). Mr. Masani was now a member of the latter, but had a low opinion of Saif-i-Azad, who is also not on good terms with Mr. Dinshaw. Lc203FD8 Dr Tagore, who attended an afternoon reception at IT is Majesty's Legation shortly before his departure, appeared to have enjoyed his visit, though he confessed that he was tired out by the round of festivities. He left with most of the party for India by way of Baghdad on May 14th. Mr. Masani and Mr. Fitter are leaving to-day by way of Meshed where the former wishes to make enquiries regarding the textile industry. f) Dr- Tagore seems to have studiously refrained from all allusions to politics Although he was a guest of the Government a veiled attack (for which the editor was taken heavily to task by the Minister of Court) was made upon him bv one Persian newspaper, which tried to embroil him over the question of his attitude to the Muhammedan religion. Another published a series of ques tions asking how his compatriots, if they followed his philosophy of non violence could ever free themselves from an alien yoke. Apart from this, the visit was a great success, although the party stayed so long that their hosts were a little tired of them before they left. But it will be surprising if the visit leads L «■&gt;t-i xr nv mnp.h Parsi monev, leaving India for Persia. 10 I have sent a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 101), the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire (No. 89), the Department of Overseas Trade (No 0 T B -130) His Majestv’s Consul-General, Meshed (No. 11), His Majesty’s Consul-General, Isfahan (No. 10) and the Acting British Consul at Shiraz (No. 6)- (36) Despatch from His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, to the London Foreign Office, No. 252, dated the 24th May 1932. I have the honour to bring to your notice the following story, which comes from Resht. It must be treated with all reserve, as the source is not impeccable, but it is far from being inherently improbable and is in any case illustrative of the Shah’s reputation :— A number of Mullahs, Seyods, proprietors and agriculturists * of the Mahal-i-Salasseh, of Tuhakabun, have been arrested, together with the sons of the well-known \ ahya l\han Amlashi, a big land owner in Amlash and its neighbourhood, and have been sent to Tehran and elsewhere under orders from Tehran. The excuse tor their arrest is that they were plotting against the present Govern ment. But this is not the case. Information gathered irom persons connected with the present Administrator of the Tunakabun properties of the Shah is to the effect that these, people own lands in the midst of the other properties of the Shah in Tunakahun and have valid and legal title-deeds and enjoy hereditary possession. The Administrator has reported this fact to Tehran and na received instructions in reply requiring him to apply to tIie i0( ^ Registration Office for the registration of the whole o properties in Tunakabun and give out that the petty landovne must state their objections and file their titles and claims wi the prescribed time limit. In the meantime all such persons a being arrested on charges of plotting against the present regi of the country. When the time limit for the filing of ob,) 60 has lapsed, these persons will be set free and their charges unexamined ”. 2. The Acting Oriental Secretary has heard quite independently of one landowner (Salar Fath Div-Salar) who has been arrested apparently because n owns a piece of land that the Shah covets. 3. In other ways His Imperial Majesty is taking an unholy interest ip tions of land ownership. The so-called settlement with the ^hei e Mohammerah, whereby the whole of the Sheikh’s lands in the South aie ^ •valued and Government property^ in the centre of Persia is to be substitu a ^ them, appears to have put into the Royal head the idea of exBrpa influence of other landowners by similar means. Vast lands in bars au P’ q ar by Mirza Ibrahim Khan Qawam and by his great rival Ismail Klian &gt; * Ashayir (Soulat-ed-Dowleh)- Both are at Tehran nov T . At a repent S£ both were informed that they would have to make an exchange mnn ar ^ Sheikh’s, and valuation to that end is going on. V here all the land m tneof Persia is to come from is not clear ; all the crown lands in the whole of Persia woma not amount to half of what Qawam and Soulat own in the South of Persia. 4. Still more remarkable is the story I hear from Mirza Jawad Khan, Amir iiumayun who is the son of the aged and very wealthy merchant Mali Muin-ut- iigjar. Amir llumayun looks after his father’s properties in the South. A tew mont is ago he paid up certain tax-adjustments, settled various outstanding accounts with the local finance department, and got the properties properlv registered, so that they legally belong, with a very clear title, to Haji Muin. About a month alter all this v T as finished the Governor-General of Pars received instructions direct from the Shah to sequester the whole of Haji Muin’s properties, and this v r as done. There was no reference to any court of law. o? 10 ! foll( T n g story, well-known to all Tehran, affords another instance of 1 he Shah s aibitiariness in matters connected vTth his properties. iMirza id hi i i unakabuni, an old man w T ho has served for manv years in Persian courts of law r and until recently held the very responsible office of Counsellor to the Supreme Court of Appeal, owns or owned a small property in Mazanderan. Certain relatives^ of his also owned land there. The Shah’s representatives having seized their land, they complained to the proper court and it was found that. Mirza Tahir supported their claims. Remonstrations were made to the Minister of Justice by the Palace and Mirza Tahir was dismissed. Having lost his employment and his land he wrote a strongly-worded petition to the Shah, quoting at the end an Arabic proverb which says “ Infidelity may not unseat a Kingdom, but oppression w 7 ill ”. He v r as summarily put in prison and is still there. G. A Persian named Nizam-ud-Din Nuri, well-knowm to members of my staff, has just been released from prison after serving a sentence of nine months for fraud. Just before he came out he was presented with a document showing that the Court had acquitted him and that he could claim damages from his adversary. He now finds that his lands in Mazanderan have been seized by agents of the Shah and his cattle and live-stock branded v r ith the Royal mark. His time in prison w 7 as spent with many other property-owmers from Mazanderan, whose land had suffered in the same way. They all said that if the market price had been paid for their land they w r ould not have minded selling it and purchasing property in another part of Persia. In most of these cases there appears to be no question of doubtful title, as the property has been in the hands of the same family for generations. The family of another very wealthy Mazanderan land-owmer, Sardar Jalil, who has recently died have also been brought to Tehran where all of them, including the women, are in prison. 7. It is doubtful whether the Shah is personally aware of the vast amount of dissatisfaction which such arbitrary acts have engendered. His Imperial Majesty keeps a special official at w T ork on the management of his large estates, and when petitions arrive they first go to this official who suppresses those winch he considers it imprudent to show to his Royal master. 8. Not long ago Vossuq-ed-DowTeh, wTio is rightly the most respected man in the country spoke to me in tones of genuine dismay about His Imperial Majesty’s insatiable land hunger. It is reaching such a point that it will soon be permissible to wonder why His Imperial Majesty does not. without more ado registered the whole of Persia in his own name, imprisoning all land- owmers until the period prescribed for objections has passed. 9.

I have the honour to report that Doctor Lindonblatt, who came to tins country three years ago to direct the organization of the National Bank, lelt Tehran for Europe on the 11th of this month. He has ostensibly gone on Lave but it seems certain that he will not return unless the report is true that the Shall himself exacted a guarantee from the German Minister that he will be availab e if required to furnish explanations of his conduct of the Bank’s affairs : his present contract would have expired in any case in October next. 2. Doctor Lindenblatt certainly had not intended to go away so soon having just moved up to Gulhek, and the sudden decision was apparently the resul o an interview with the Minister of Court on the 1st June, after which it vvas announced that he would be leaving within two or three days. Later his d e P a ture was postponed to allow for the preparation of a balance sheet at the insis e request, it is said, of Hussein Quli Khan Nawabi, the Chairman of the Boa p &lt; the Bank, who told the Shah that otherwise he could accept no responsibility the affairs of the Bank. 3. The reasons for what amounts to the summary dismissal of this U viously powerful German are not altogether clear though it was obvious e _ before the Shah’s feelings were outraged by the press attacks reported in. despatch No. 626 of the 4th November 1931 (not received) that his influence^ German influence generally were waning ; the recent order made by a ^ ] nl ^j 0I1 Court that the Persian Government should pay the costs of an unsuccessful nc laid against a journalist there in connection with these attacks _ has P er helped to firing matters to a head. His Majesty is also no doubt disturbed a ^ continued depreciation of the Persian currency, which it was the fi is y n11 ; sC( [ of the National Bank to support. Whether or not the Shah actually dis Doctor Lindenblatt, he in any case authorised this course.4. The Minister of Court had originally much to do with the appointment . . . c * or hi in(ie nblatt and has, until quite recently, supported him against criticism. Lately, however, various causes of friction have arisen and, as was lepoited in the memorandum on the exchange situation enclosed in my despatch* No. of Lie 2nd June, Teymourtache attacked his former favourite last month in connection with the ineffective handling of the exchange market. Other r union led causes tor Doctor Lindenblatt’s departure are in connection with alleged facilities gL en to the Russians about buying exchange, the recent heavy loss sustained by the Nhtional Lank in accepting worthless American paper, the indemnity paid without the Board’s permission to a German assistant, or the heavy expenditure incurred by the Bank over the sugar factories and other industrial concerns. 5. Before his departure Doctor Lindenblatt paid farewell visits to Mr. Wilkinson of the Imperial Bank of Persia and Mr. Jacks of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company and held language to both of them intended to convey the impression that the hostility of His Majesty’s Government in general and the reluctance of the two British institutions, especially the Imperial Bank of Persia, which they represent to co-operate with him had materially contributed to his failure. In a word, he was at pains to show himself a bad loser as well as an unsuccessful banker. 6. There are of course suggestions that Doctor Lindenblatt’s elimination is only partly due to causes over which he could have exercised a measure of control, and that it indicates a success of the opposition in the Cabinet to Tey mourtache’s economic policy. Thus it is said that Doctor Lindenblatt, relying on the support of the Minister of Court, adopted in matters of general financial and economic policy an attitude of independence towards the Minister of Finance which Taqizadeh found hard to bear. Considerable friction between the two Ministers resulted so much so that it was believed in March [see my despatch No. 135 of March 11th (not received)] that Teymourtache was “ look ing for a new Minister of Finance ”. But Taqizadeh is still in office and Doctor Lindenblatt’s head is obviously, people say, the outward and visible sign of his victory over the Minister of Court. It is natural enough that persons long resident in Persia, and therefore familiar with the melancholy story of successive foreign advisers and servants of the Persian Government, should conclude that the merits or demerits of the foreigner never are the factor that decides his fate. I have obviously not sufficient experience to form an independent judgment. Of one thing, however, I feel fairly sure and that is that only a man of outstand ing personality as well as of first class technical capacity could hope to achieve anything substantial as the servant of the Persian Government, and why should such a super-man adventure himself in a country and among people such as these ? 7. Herr Vogel, a German with a Russian wife, is at present in charge of the National Bank. There is talk of the appointment of a Swiss or of a Frenchman : the latter would probably be the less desirable alternative, specially to the German staff of the Bank. Another German is unlikely their reputation having suffered considerably since the time when Count Schulenburg so successfully pushed his country’s interests here. No Persian banker is thought to be yet lit to take charge of the National Bank though Reza Quli Khan went to Europe recently to train for the post. This Persian is understood to be working under the Westminster Bank in Paris and it might be of interest to learn of his repu tation and ideas. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade [No. 0. T.

An English translation of the law was enclosed in Mr. Dodd’s despatch No. 470 of August 28th, 1931 [Enclosure of Serial No. (64), File No. 3-M.131], Lc203FD 'File not available.55 * ' (42) 1 Despatch prom His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the London Foreign Office, No. 305, dated the 1st July 1932. With reference to my despatch No. 256 of May 24th [Serial No. (34)j j have the honour to state that information regarding the arrest and trial of these persons has now been published in the Tehran Press. It is stated that investigations made by the police in the early part of this year revealed the existence not of a plot but of an extensive intelligence system in which several employees of Government Departments were involved, carried on in the interests of another country (obviously the U. S. S. R.). A number of arrests were made, and thirty-two persons were tried bv a military court. Four of these men (three Mohammadans and one Armenian) have now been condemned to death for espionage and for the betrayal of official secrets. Their names are :— Bagher Khan Iranban, an eir-employee of the Ministry of Roads and Communications. Mohamad Ali Mirza Khaghani, an ez-chief cipher officer to the Council of Ministers. Azizullah Khan Minoui, employee of the Ministry of Finance. Caspar Melikian, a telegraphist. Twenty-one others have been condemned to various terms of imprisonment ranging from fifteen years to six months, and the remainder acquitted. Copies of this despatch have been sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, No. 140, and to His Majesty’s High Commissioner in Iraq, No. 75. (43) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the London Foreign Office, No. 308, dated the 8th July 1932. With reference to my despatch No. 305 of the 1st instant [Serial No. (39)], 1 have the honour to report that Caspar Malikian, one of the four men con demned to death for revealing official information, is said to have been identical with a certain Caspar Gasparian, a former telegraph clerk in the Indo-European Telegraph Department. 2. I am informed that he was once found divulging telegrams when in the employ of the Department a fact which suggests that in his case at least the charge of espionage may have been true. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, No. 143, and to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for ’Iraq, No. 77. (44) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the London Foreign Office, No. 322, dated the 15th July 1932. The news arrived about a fortnight ago that the Persian Government would this year only receive some three hundred thousand pounds sterling in respect ot royalty from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and created grave despondency- The press was mobilized and discharged a volley of ill-informed abuse, of which I enclose a few specimens, while thes Minister of Court simultaneously initiated discussions of the situation with Mr. Jacks, the Director of the Company resident in Persia. Mr. Jacks told me that Teymourtache, while almost prepared to adtni responsibility for the press campaign, conveyed the clear impression that e arguments he advanced in defence of that campaign made no intellectual app ea to him and that in putting them forward he was merely obeying the all highes commands. 2. Being a little unwilling to appear indifferent to an obviously attack on a great British institution, I told Teymourtache, at the end of a k . which I had occasion to write to him with regard to the General Treaty negiL 1 ^ tions, that I was going away for a week’s holiday and that I liked to think tia before my return the press campaign “ absurd in its unanimity and unannno in its absurdity ” would have ceased., . f,' a ^ 1?e °J th « Anglc-Persian Oil Company has appeared during the last few &lt;lavs. It no further abuse is published, I shall feel justified in concluding that there is tor the nonce a reluctance to fall foul of His Majesty’s Government 4 The position as regards the royalty is that the Persian Government have leiused to accept it at any rate pending an examination of the accounts which the Company has invited them to undertake. 5 ] am sending a copy of this despatch, with its enclosure, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, No. 153. S Enclosure in Tehran despatch No. 322, dated the 15th July 1932 il^nmw^QQ 1 n* Pa i , ^ S Q t -o te | ,h ?i‘ he K ersian Royalties'have decreased from il,.100,000 tor 1930 to 1306,812 for 1931. After quoting a summary return of the LTJ!lT “li 11 e , x P endlture o f &gt; h e Company for 1931 from the printed statements issued by the Company, the paper demonstrates that the same royalties have been shown by the Company m the printed report to be £134,750. What is the reason lor this apparent and unaccountable difference between the two figures given both as royalties due to the Persian Government for the same year. The paper, Information ”, a French publication shows that'the Anglo-Persian Oil Company s output of crude oil and oil products during 1931 had a surplus of tons 143,000 over and above that for 1930. “ Taking all factors of depreciation ot the price ot the oil m the world markets as a result of terrific competition, etc.. into account we cannot imagine that while the output was higher during 1931 to such an extent, the income should have been so enormously decreased. Further the general income of the Company during 1931 shrank by two-thirds but the 1 eisian Government royalties by f. ^Wiy this big difference ? It naturally occurs to one and more especially to a Persian whether the facts are really as stated. I Ins gives more right and opportunity to the Government to examine with care the accounts represented by the Company. Are these depreciations in the 1 ersian royalties actuated by political or simpler and commercial factors f llns remains to be known. The Government is to elucidate this point ”. ^ St issue of the P a P er Iran which deal s with the above question is No. 3837 ol June 29th, 1932. Phe paper expresses satisfaction at the fact that other papers like Shafaq etcetera have taken up the comments, since the date of the Iran paper’s comments in regard to the question of the A. P. O. C.’s royalties. The matter, the paper adds, is of such magnitude in principle that it is worth being taken up bv the! Gov eminent and the Majlis and in fact by all authorities of importance in the country. The principle should first be admitted that the ultimate aim in grant ing a concession to a foreign company by the Persian Government is not to see that as a result the beneficiary Company enjoys the third place in importance among the oil producing and oil-selling companies of the world : that it creates every day a new institution and subsidiary profiteering company for the better exploitation of profits to go direct into the pockets of English shareholders and the British Government. Far from this consideration it is at least conceivable that the Persian Government which granted the concession should also receive sufficient benefits of the concession which is worked on its own territory. There is no need here to give the history of the genesis of the D’Arcy concession in an epocli of our national life when concessions of this nature and more important ones were given by indifferent officials who were essentially devoid of patriotism, against comparatively trifling .substitutes. In an age when the renunciation of solemn and unquestionable obligations of debts, etcetera, does not even astonish the general public throughout the world, there is every reason to believe that a cancellation of such a concession would not occasion any objection or reprimand against Persia. If the Persian Government were allowed to receive, as its royalties, a free supply of oil products for its current needs, its royalties must needs have far exceeded those which are assigned to it under the present arrange ment, setting aside for the moment the calculation of what would have b&lt;Ten the gain of the Persian Government were it to enjoy the whole concession. The D’Arcy concession is not therefore one that can be imagined to be beneficial and advantageous to the Persian Government, and the more so when we come to think that Persia as a legitimate partner in the Company is denied all participa tion in the secret dealings or the general trend of affairs of the Company. Persia is ignorant of the masonic-like secrets of the Company (Faramoosh-Khaneh).57 Persia is allowed a 16 per cent, on the net revenues of the Company and logically and indispensably she is entitled to a supervision of all processes of expenditure and transactions arising between the gross and the net revenues stages ; but is this allowed to Persia in practice 1 The reply is in the negative. The statutes of the Company and its various regulations allow, most unpleasant to acknow ledge, more freedom of supervision and scrutiny to a private shareholder than to Persia. This state of things does not produce an enviable result for Persia and it is time for the Persian Government, both for the present as for future con siderations, that it should have formulated with serious and firm attitude its future position with the Company on a basis of equality and participation in all profits. There was a time when owing to the immediate needs of the Persian Govern ment any sum offered by the Company had such an attraction for them that by its acceptance, they gave their tacit acquiescence to the accounts and balance sheets of the Company ; but at the present moment the situation allows the Persian Government to throw off with ease a few hundred thousand pounds sterling pending the time when they can elucidate their accounts with the Com- pany. We do not advocate a high-handed policy on the part of the Persian Government but we do not see why the Persian Government should be oppressed either. So we hope that the Government will take the necessary decision and exert the required energy. We understand with satisfaction that the Govern ment share our views and in the same spirit, the A. P. O. C. has been notified that the Government do ndt accept their royalties at the sum fixed pending the clari fication of the accounts. (45) Despatch prom His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the London Foreign Office, No. 330, dated the 27th July 1932. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 330 of June 8th last (not received) and to state that I have read with interest the latest figures regarding Persian armaments supplied by the Persian Govern ment to the League of Nations. 2. The following observations by the Military Attache to this Legation may be of interest Military Forces. —The actual number of effectives shown on March 20th last, namely 71,017 is more than fifteen thousand in excess of the number estimated by Lieutenant-Colonel Dodd to be correct, even if gendarmerie (Amnieh) are included. Lieutenant-Colonel Dodd’s figures are compiled from several sources ; they have been carefully checked throughout the year and are believed to be substantially correct. According to a previous League of Nations’ report, No. D.|R.C.|5 of November 12th, 1931, a copy of which was transmitted to me under cover of your despatch No. 734 of December 14th last, the Persian Government aim at an army totalling, when fully organised, 72,000 effectives. According to the present report this number was on March 20th, 1932 less than a thousand short of completion. At the same time army organisation on the lines laid down, namely nine divisions and twenty-eight 'frontier battalions, had not been begun. It may also be noted that though the Conscription Law of 1925 allows for two years colour service and twenty-one years reserve service, no money is actually expended on the reserve ; in other words, there is no reserve. Naval Forces. —It is believed that 250 personnel of all ranks were, on the date given, undergoing training in Italy. This is the number of effectives an to it should be added the * maintenance ’ crews of the present obsolete vessc s. who mav number another 100 ; making a grand total of 350,—less than na the number given by the Persian Government. Naval Armaments. —No information is available in regard in the vessels “ Homay ” and “'Shahin ” mentioned in the report but I am causing to be made. The other six vessels are those ordered by the Persian Go\e ment from Italian shipyards. Air Formations .—It is estimated that the numbers shown are about three times the numbers actually employed. * Air Armaments. —Here again the numbers are doubled. -The Persian . Force possesses fifteen aeroplanes of which not more than half are airwor &gt; while all are obsolete as military aircraft.63 Enclosure III to Serial ^o. (16). 'Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated the 21st July After reading in the “ Messager ” of this morning the report of the dis cussion in the Mejlis on the subject of the activities of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, I have a feeling of regret that the Persian Government however great the disappointment may be at the smallness of the royalty should have done nothing to refute the view which appears to be held that the Ang o-Persian Oil Company are hardly fair, and certainly not generous m their dealings with the Persian nation. It is a matter of universal knowledge that there is no oil company in the world that has not suffered severely during the past year, and I believe it to be a fact that the shareholders of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, including the Persian Government, have suffered relatively less seriously than those of most other companies. I like to hope that when these matters are further discussed in the Mejlis, the Government will be at pains to remove any false impressions and to show that it fully shares the view of the Company that adverse trading conditions can be more successfully faced in a spirit ot close eo-oneration than in the presence of recrimination and mistrust. (47) Very Confidential Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the London Foreign Office, No. 352, dated the 12th August 1932. With reference to my despatch No. 334 of July 29th (not received) in which I reported the illness of the Minister of Court, I have the honour to inform you that His Highness returned from the seaside on August 41 h and was present at the annual reception given by the Majlis to celebrate the establishment of a Constitutional regime in Persia. He appeared to me to be in fair health hut his gaiety, as always rather boisterous, seemed rather forced. He told me that his doctors insist on his leading a very quiet life, including virtual absten tion from tobacco. 2. It is not possible to state what precisely has occurred. There is, however, every reason to believe that the immediate cause of Teymourtache’s illness, which was probably angina pectoris or excessive blood pressure or both, was a violent scene with the Shah. No one else was present at the audience when the scene is believed to have occurred, and it is therefore not known what was the cause of the trouble. The surmise which finds most general acceptance is that the investigations 'which have been preceding for over* two months into the affairs of the National Bank have revealed irregularities for which Teymourtache is largely responsible. There is a virtual certainty that exchange operations of an unseemly nature have been performed, some of them—it is freely alleged—for the Shah’s own benefit. 3. Wliere nothing is certain except that Teymourtache is obviously worried as well as ill, it is pardonable to reconstruct in the imagination a scene at which the Minister’s self-control broke down under reproaches which, though possibly merited, were a glaring example of Satan rebuking Sin. 4. I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the Majlis reception whether there was a crisis. He, rather characteristically, affected not to understand what I meant.. .When I pressed him further his assurance that there was no crisis was positive enough. I am inclined to accept this assurance at its face value especially as I am told by persons who have experience of this country that there has never been any beating about the bush when the Shah has decided to remove a political head ; action has always been prompt and decisive. 5. Nonetheless, Tevmourtache’s enemies are still busilv, and with an openness which is surprising, engaged in spreading stories to his discredit and event asserting that a revolution is possible. T made mention of these mur- mu rings in my despatch No. 33/ of the 29th July (not received) and reported that Vussuq-ed-Dowleh attached no credence to them. I have no reason not to believe that he is right and that the Shah is not as firmlv established as ever, except for one factor which suggests a vague doubt : for some weeks pastreports from His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz have contained references to increasing unrest among the Lurs, who have every reason to hate the present regime ; these reports show, moreover, that no serious attempt lias been made to cope with the situation with the result, as I have just learnt from a British subject who is in business at Burujird, that a party of Lurs recently seized the Governor of Khoremabad and two other senior officials two or three miles out side the town and successfully extracted a ransom for their release from their families. He further reports that while attacks on detaciiment of troops are frequent the Lurs are not seriously molesting ordinary traffic on the road. 6. I understand that in the past the Shah has always struck promptly and heavily at the first symptoms of tribal unrest. If he does not deal promptly with this impudent outrage I shall begin to wonder whether he is not a little uneasy and therefore unwilling to despatch troops to the provinces and out of his own immediate reach. (48) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the London Foreign Office, No. 362, dated the 24th August 1932. As indicated in my telegram No. 112 of the 15th instant (not received) the article from a “ special correspondent ” entitled “ The Persian Gulf ” which was published in the “ Morning Post ” of July 25th has created a stir. 2. It was reproduced with wonderful promptitude on August 14th and subjected to fierce criticism on the same day by both the “ Iran ” and the “ Shafagh-i-Sorkh ” (whose anonymous deputy is undoubtedly Dashti. This gentleman has, I understand, always suffered from an anti-British bias which was augmented by a very flat refusal of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to pay him blackmail). I enclose summarised translations of articles from these two papers and copy of the letter which I wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs after perusing them. 3. In the course of the next few days I learned definitely that the “ Morning definite advantage in conducting current business with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and that the comments on it had been inspired, if not written, by Tevmourtache. Similar articles have appeared in all other papers, so similar indeed that the Editor of the ‘‘ Messager ” considers the one word “ ibid ” a sufficient summary of them. 4. Having occasion to visit the Minister for Foreign Affairs on August 20th, I spoke to His Highness with a measure of harshness. I began by wondering how the press had got hold of the article at all, and when he replied that it was inevitable, I said that I did not suppose that there was a^soul in Tehran who subscribed to the ‘‘Morning Post ”. He then said that Tie and everybody else believed that the “ Morning Post ” was a leading mouthpiece of Conservative opinion and it was for this reason that he himself had been grievouslv shocked bv the article. I replied that at most the “ Morning Post ” represented the extreme right wing of Conservative thought but apart from the question of the political importance of the “ Morning Post ” I should have though that he might have noticed that the article was not an editoiial but simply from “ cl special correspondence ; at the same time I said that 1 vas astonished that the “ Morning Post ’’ should not have consulted the Foreign Office before publishing an article which was foolishly provocative. But whv, before launchinsr a furious campaign on the appeal ance of one foolish article did not the Persian Government telegraph to London and instruct its represen tative there to make enquiries ’ Feroughi said that he had written, vlncn I said was not much use. 5. His Highness then suggested that the Government was not responsible for the campaign and said that there was no censoiship. I replied that it was universally known that the press never dreamt of commenting on toi oign relations excent in a sense which it was sure would be appio\ed. I know there was no censorship in the strict sense of the term but that did not affect my point which was that there w\as not one reader of the Persian press who would have the slightest doubt regarding- the sourcs of inspiration in the case of these articles Furthermore, there would not be another word written on the suhiect if the Government did not wish it. Feroughi looked sad and said the whole business w r as most regrettable but made no attempt to icfute w lat I had just said.I • 65 6. Having made my point that the campaign was run by the Government I went on to say that a curious thing was that on the strength of one wretched article the press was seeking to establish the thesis that His Majesty’s Govern ment had always wished to see a weak and divided Persia, whereas we know from long passages in Teymourtache’s letter of the 11th June 1931 [see Tehran despatch Iso. 301 of the 9th July 1931 (not received)], that a strong and centralised Persia was a paramount and obvious British interest. Feroughi answered that it was just because they had believed this that they were so dismayed at reading in a leading English paper an article expressing regret at our omission to annex Bushire and Moharmnerah at the end of the war and discussing the poor little Persian flotilla as a menace to British interests. 1 yidicated again that it was foolish to draw conclusions from one silly article. 7. In conclusion 1 enquired whether the Persian papers had deliberately misquoted, by referring to the (Persian) troubles of 1925 whereas the “ Morning Post ” correspondent mentioned the (’Iraq) insurrection of 1920. His Highness said he had noticed this blunder and was sure it was not deliberate. 8. I cannot, of course, be certain that Feroughi, who has been described as “ an old buffer, in the strict sense of the term ”, will pass on my remarks ; but I do not propose to make a special appointment with Teymourtache in order to tell him what I think of his press campaign because I think there is Post ” article had been communicated to the press by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and avoiding an “ appeal to Caesar 9. I cannot pretend to know Teymourtache well enough to say what his motive has been in launching the campaign. There are a variety of possibilities ; he may have been genuinely upset, as Feroughi certainly seemed to be, by the Morning Post effusion ; simple though this explanation is, to the point of puerility, 1 do not entirely exclude it. A less simple, and therefore inherently more probable idea is that he wanted a red herring to divert attention from the affairs of the rsiationa! Bank, his own illness and all the chatter which has attended it It this is the case, he owes the Morning Post a considerable debt ot gratitude tor providing such an admirable article. If he had any qualms of conscience he would probably still them with the reflection that His Majesty’s Government are not at all likely to be disturbed by a storm in a tea-cup. But i there was only one motive, the hypothesis which I am inclined to favour is nro ..rpf I s ^ indication of irritation at the somewhat stately unXatW I \ e ' otiations : in a ' TOrJ &gt; Teymourtache has tl at h he h! t » h n, P , 1 , 1 !.

(49) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the London Foreign Office, No. 364, dated the 26th August 1932. I have the honour to report that a circular by the Ministry of Public Instruc tion appeared in the press on August 18th stating that foreign primary schools were no longer to accept Persian pupils, with effect from the opening of the scholastic year at the beginning of September. 2. About two months ago, Mr. Thompson, the Princpal of the Stuart Memo rial College at Isfahan, was informed confidentially by the Minister of Educa tion that it was the intention of the Persian Govemment at some future date to adopt the measure now announced but he received no indication that immediate action was contemplated. 3. The American Minister made immediate representations to Teymonr- tache but from the account which he gave me of the interview, I did not gather that he received any encouragement to hope that this circular would be recon sidered. Talking airily and loosely Teymourtache apparently said that it was time that Modern Persia should remove the stigma of inferiority inherent in mis sionary enterprise, while povfessing that he would welcome foreign educational activity provided it was of a purely secular nature. 4. Mr. Thompson, who came up from Isfahan as soon as the circular was issued, takes the view that it would be useless to fight the matter as a question of right ; but he has some hope that it may be possible to obtain a postponemen yf the decision and gain time to transform the five primary schools of the Church Mis sionary Society into Persian private schools in wdiich the Church Missionary Society would enjoy special facilities. 5. I share Mr. Thompson’s view that anything in the nature of a formal representation would probably do more harm than good. When I saw* the Minister for Foreign Affairs on August 20th I told him that I did not wish to make a representation on the subject of the circular thoughJ wished to discuss it with him. I said that it seemed to me at least doubtful whether the terms of the circular must not be regarded as an absolute violation of the intention of the Ex change of Notes attached to the Tariff Autonomy Treaty (see Sir Robert (dive sm 70 the account which I have given him nf i plain the enquiry.

In my confidential despatch No. 337 of July 28th [Serial No. (51)] and previous repoi ts I have drawn your attention to the signs of growing discontent in this country. Among the causes of this discontent those of an economic kind are naturally the most important for the masses of the people, and to these econo mic causes, mostly engendered by the Trade Monopoly Law, must now to be added the fact that the harvest has been a failure in most parts of Persia and that the prices of all cereals have in consequence risen seriously. The situation is likely to be difficult until the crops of next year are harvested, though there should be no actual famine. 2 ; In Southern Persia the rainfall last winter was most inadequate. Pars and Khuzistan had the worst drought for many years and practically no rain at all fell in the Bushire area with the result that thousands of distressed villagers have migrated to the plateau in hopes of finding work or food. The Government has done practically nothing to help these people and an increase of petty brigandage in the Shiraz area has been inevitable. At Bushire itself the authori ties have taken steps to procure water from elsewhere and furnish it to the people, but prices are very high. 3. In other parts of the country the winter weather was favourable but a dry spring followed and in a number of districts the “ sen ” pest did much damage to the crops. In July when the crops were being harvested very severe and widespread thunderstorms beat down the standing crops and damaged the sup plies collected on the threshing floors. Kerman province suffered most. Some villa ges were almost washed away : nearly two hundred lives were lost ; and of the under ground water chanels on which the province is largely dependent, more than a quarter were badly damaged. A subscription list, headed by the Shah, has been opened to relieve some of the distress. 4. Grain is usually a glut on the market and the Persian Government has tried to encourage its export by granting special conditions to grain exporters about obtaining import licences. As a result the old stocks available at such a grain centre as Kermanshah were not so great as might otherwise have ben ex pected after a succession of good crops and even there grain prices have doubled within six months. In Tehran during the same period flour has risen in price by fifty per cent. 5. The Soviet Government, partly to obtain these special import facilities and partly to make up the deficiency'reported in their Southern districts, have been large purchasers of grain, and also of cattle, in Azerbaijan, the Caspian pro vinces and Khorasan. Complete statistics are not available but the despatch to the Soviet Union of some 80,000 tons of wheat, mainly from Meshed, has been reported. The inhabitants of Tabriz became so alarmed at the possibility of a shortage next winter that they persuaded the Persian Government to reduce a large grain contract which had been made with the Soviet authorities. In Khora san it is understood that the Persian Government has given a considerable credit LC203FDto finance the Soviet purchases and this bears out other reports of the inability of the Soviet Government to pay cadi at present. n In criite of the distress the Government has not so far raised the embargo on the import of wheat, a result which may be due to the pressure of a Majlis largely filled with landowners. 7 1 have sent copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade r\ T r» n T 'I 190) the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No! 173), and to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire •{No. 133).

Despatch feom His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, to the London Foreign Office, No. 337, dated THE 28th JTTLY 1932. In the course of the reception at the French Legation on the 14th July Vossuq-ed-Dowleh made an appointment with me in order to discuss the general internal situation. Though he has taken no active part m politics since his re urn from Europe at the beginning of 1926 I was not altogether surprised in view of the language which he had previously already held to me (see my despatch No. 252 of Uie 24th May) [Serial No. (36)]. 2 He came to lunch a few days later and for about two hours he gave me a o-ioomv account of the general state of affairs. He said he was not an alarmist m that he did not in the least believe those who told him that a violent upheaval was imminent ; in the first place revolutions did not occur m 1 ersia without sup port and encouragement from a foreign Government, and m the second place e people of Persia were quite effectively disarmed. But apart from this negative optimism his picture was one of unmitigated gloom ; no landed proprietor was safe from the Shah’s avarice and the economic position of the peasants was so bad that thev were abandoning their fields to seek work on the roads °r m ^e towns at four Rials (about tenpence) a day. Unless there was a change of which he saw little hope, in the conduct and direction of public economy and in the mm 1 of the Shah it was hardly an exaggeration to say that within a few years there would be no landed proprietors left and no peasants except on the magnihcem estates of the Shah. In these circumstances it was impossible not to anticipate chaos if anything happened to His Majesty. 3. I asked, knowing full well that the answer would be in the affirmative, whe ther what he had just told me was being generally said and His Highness replica that but for the small elioue who were prospering under the present dls 9 el ) saT1 ° everybody was saving the same thing. I then asked whether he supposed that t Shah had any idea of this and he replied that he much doubted it whether an' h would have the courage to tell him. I then asked what would happen it he a say five other ex-Prime Ministers memorialised His Majesty ; he said the memorial were deferentially worded he did not imagine that the fc&gt;iian vou cast the memorialists into prison. But (and it was rather like the pttle n boys) the idea was not at all a practical one ; of the six ex-Pnme Mimste occurred to him two, whom he named, were notorious even amongst 1 crsmii p ticians for their timidity ; two others were definitely in the Shah’s black book so there remained only Mirza Hassan Khan Mustaufi and himself. 4. I then said that one or two persons had tried to make me believe that Teymourtache was playing deep and sinister game in that he was dehoera &gt; encouraging the Shah to pursue a course which would end in disaster ana &gt; P. vide Teymourtache with the opporunity of fulfilling great ambitions; t nn s . to me, from my estimate of Teymourtache’s character, to be extremely - I. the position which he now enjoyed of great authority without strict!' T _ responsibility appeared to be, from his point*of view, quite an ideal one. ^ ed-Dowleh said he entirely agreed. Going on to talk about Teyrnouriac _ ^ said that rather successful efforts had been made to embitter then re ^ ^ by making Toy mourt ache think that he wished to supplant him. Thei c v a. ing in the world which he would like less and he could not help thinking Teymourtache realised this.■fWHH 72 5. I asked His Highness why, as Teymourtache was probably the only man who could perhaps bring about a change in the direction of affairs, he did not go and tell him frankly with what anxiety he viewed the postion. Vossuq replied that he was not at all sure whether Teymourtache would dare to represent the situation in its true light to the Shah but nonetheless he was quite disposed to discuss the position with Teymourtache and indeed he had, at the reception at the French Legation on the 14th July, suggested that they should meet. He would pursue matters further. But I do no tknow whether he has done so. 6. I do not think that Vossuq-ed-Dowleh’s account of the situation is pre judiced. If he is right there is no immediate danger to the stability of the regime but the danger will be great when the Shah dies. 7. It may be of interest to record that Mustaufi recently spoke in almost exactly the same sense to Mr. Monypenny, the acting Oriental Secretary.

Mejlis yesterday wmived parliamentary immunity of Soulat-ud-dowleh and his son' Nasir Khan so as to permit of arrest for alleged intrigue for fresh Qashqai disturbances. Received information from Sardar Intisham brother of Soulat-ud-dowleh. Intrigue was supposed to be favoured by famine conditions. (53) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the London, Foreign Office, No. 381, dated the 9th September 1932. I have the honour to report, that according to information received by the Military Attache of this Legation a new order has been issued within the last few days by the Shah to the officers of his army repeating with added emphasis the order against social relations with Europeans reported m Sir Robert o n e s despatch No. 144 of .Tune 1st, 1931 [Serial No. (32), F.le No. 3-N.|31]. In order, moreover, to emphasize the importance of the matter, the order as een eir culated with instructions that it should be initialled bv each omcer. 2 . It is of course natural to regard this matter as a further manifestation of Imperial xenophobia, although Persians in touch with the Legation appear to believe that its main object is to put a stop to the increasiip, number o alienees contracted by Persian officers with Russian women K thus s the ea. the measure is perhaps justified in order to protect t e ar J • ? inability influences to which it might conceivably become exposed through the mabi &gt; of the susceptible Persian officers to protect themsehes. 3. The recent espionage trial reported in my ^v abo^t July [Serial No. (42)1, would naturally tend to make the Shah uneasy &gt; b subversive influence in the army, especially at a time when ^ in accumulating, while the confidences of General iro , P . g anx j e ^y despatch show that in some influential quarteis at an^ c , on the subject of communistic propaganda. 4.

While dining recently with some PeW ‘ ans A ’’orirndafsIcretarV frequented bv both Europeans and Persians the Acting One 1 ’ • received a message from a Persian officer, who was seated at the next tame, r73 the effect that he could not speak to him in the restaurant but would be o-i ac j + meet him in some less public place. This officer whom Mr. Monypenny has known well for twelve years, was careful to avoid direct communication .although seated dose by, and sent his message through a mutual friend \ German lady, however, who was also present exchanged greetings with the officer to the amusement of a number of Persian civilians who warned him of the fate which awaited him for speaking to a European lady. 5. I have sent a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the fW ernment of India (No. 185). (54) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the London Foreign Office, No. 390, dated the 10th September 1932. In my despatch No. 305 of July 1st [Serial No. (42)], and previous des patches, 1 have had the honour to report the discovery by the Persian Govern ment of the existence of an extensive Soviet intelligence service in this country. As an interesting continuation of these despatches, I enclose an account of ;i conversation between General Airom, the Chief of Police, and the Acting Oriental Secretary, in which the former furnished some interesting information regarding Soviet methods, speaking with a frankness—genuine frankness Mr. Monypenny believes—which is astounding. 2. General Airom, to whom I referred in paragraph 7 of my despatch No. 128 of March 9th [Serial No. (29)], as a “ new broom ”, is still a youngish man. He gives the impression of being a man of intelligence and would give an im pression of character also were it not that he has every appearance of being an opium addict. He has the reputation of being a crank upon the subject of Soviet spying, and it is probable that uneasiness as to his personal position has led him not only to unbosom himself to a foreign diplomat, but to magnify the size and importance of the dangers with which he is contending. It is, however, possible that his account of the obstruction he meets at the hands of’Teymour- tache and Feroughi is to some extent based upon fact. A vigorous sweep of the broom, which would no doubt be technically sound and might produce some inter esting results, might also provoke reactions of an inconvenient nature. In a f ear of the Soviet TJ nion is perhaps as good a reason as any other it General Airom is right in saying that an obstructive pair of hands rests on the broom. 3. I do not attach too much importance to the Soviet intelligence system, or grven the natural advantages of their position I doubt whether all the infor mation to be gat eh red by underhand means materially reinforces the Soviet Gm eminent which from economic even more than geographical causes is so p aced as almost to be able to dictate to the Persian Government. It is difficult o judge or the effects of Soviet propaganda. The propaganda is probably no moie intense than it has ever been, but the soil is undoubtedly much more fertile. ic remedy for this state of affairs is in part bound up with world economics and in part lies with the Persian Government and the Shah themselves. But the r&gt;nah seems to think it well that the little finger of the Pahlevi should be thicker than the loins of the Kajars. 4. T am sending a copy of this despatch, with its enclosure, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Enclosure to Serial No. (54). Record of conversation between General Airom and the Acting Oriental Secre tary, August 28th 1932. I called on General Airom, the Chief of Police, on the morning of the 28th August and reminded him of the suggestion that he had made a few days earlier o r. k ummerhayes that a member of this Legation should call on him as he nad some information to give concerning Soviet activities in this country. I &lt;H . ( / ( . ia . ' 10 object of my visit was therefore to receive any information he vis in o impart on the subject, and he proceeded without any further encourage ment to speak roughly as follows mi propaganda is being carried on very actively at nresent in Persia. , j ne soviet authorities employ a large number of agents in the country and are penc mg money freely. Two years ago Soviet propaganda in Persia was notof much significance. Now it is a different story, owing to the commercial depression and the widespread poverty and discontent. Numbers of Persians are losing their means of livelihood, and among such people Soviet money and propaganda cannot fail to have some effect. Although it is difficult to believe that Persians can ever be genuine Communists, yet the present situation is one that needed watching. At this point I expressed the opinion that even twu or three years ago Communist propaganda was not by any means without effect in some parts of Persia. For instance in Bakhtiari the Khans had experienced great difficulty with the peasants in their villages in Chahar Mahal, more especially in a locality where the Soviet Government had opened a branch of their oil-selling agency. General Airon stated that in other parts of Persia, as well as in Bakhtiari, Soviet propaganda had caused unrest among the peasants. He went on to say that it w r as difficult for Persia, with her long, desert, frontiers to prevent the arrival and departure of agents. According to informa tion he had received many Soviet agents were able to go via East Persia and Afghanistan to India. That v^as a frontier which required careful watching. An official formerly employed in the Soviet Consulate General at Meshed was now T in Tehran. His name w^as “ Richer! ” alias “ Gird ”, and he was Chief of the G. P. U. in Persia, and a very active agent. Persia had now become the centre for Soviet propaganda in the East. The methods employed were simple. Agents were engaged and paid, at first, only to obtain information. The Soviet authorities had their agents in all Departments of the Persian Gov ernment. Later those agents who w^ere found suitable v^ere employed to spread communist ideas. Then of course, in Persia there were the Soviet schools. The recent order against foreign primary schools in this country was issued at his own instigation. I here intervened to point out that the order had hit our schools as well. General Airom agreed but added : “ what does it matter ? The main point is to .stop Communist propaganda in Soviet schools ”. General Airom then continued to say that a large number of white Russians had been acting as Agents for the Communists. He had for sometime been occupied in checking the activities of these white Russians and ha/1, as a result, received numerous protests from the Soviet Embassy. The Soviet authorities had even admitted-that the vffiite Russians were their most useful agents and had requested that thev should not be molested. The Soviet Ambassador had recently called on him. Thev had had a very frank discussion of the situation. He had asked the Soviet Ambassador whether he really hoped to make the Persians genuine Communists because if he did, he w r as merely wasting time. ic ersians v’ould just take his money and do nothing. The Ambassador stated that alter all it v4s his business to obtain all the information he con d for his Government He (General Airom) agreed but protested that it was surely unnecessary to ha/o an intelligence service on such a large scale ; to have agents everyv leit, am o spend money so lavishly. The Ambassador had, I gathered, accused General ^' ro ^ of f ,‘™ e , ss !]’g vieilanee where Russians were concerned, and had spoken to him about t deportation of the Head of a Soviet School at Tehran. It appears that after the arrest and trial a few weeks ago Of those Persian Government employees who were suspected of betraying Government secrets, cyphers, e ’ , had been received a number of anonymous threatening letters. His “ ts ,'® d f b r e o e ' able to discover the Persians who had distributed them obtained the information that one Lukov ski, le . therefore denorted Tehran, was ttie author of these letters General Airomhad therefore Lukovski, in spite of strong protests from the Soviet Embassy.

I asked him a free hand he could suppress Soviet P 1 c ^ that the Shah had General Airom what reply the &lt; Shah had made. He said mat listened attentively but had said nothing. Le203FDGeneral Airon then repeated that the Russians were spending a great deal of money ; some of their agents were receiving thousands of tomans for their work ; and that although in normal times the effect would be negligible yet now, owing to the economic crisis and the widespread distress, their activities could not be ignored : and that as a result of his actions against their agents, etc., he had incurred their hatred ; in fact it had been reported to him that the Soviet agents had threatened that “ one day they would see him hanged in the public square in Tehran I do not know General Airom well and cannot therefore explain why he gave me this information, unless it is that Soviet hostility has made him really nervous, and that he feels he cannot rely on Teymourtache or Feroughi to support him if at any time the Shah should be inclined to listen to intrigues against him. 4 (Initialled) R. G. M., 29th August 1932. (55) Despatch from His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, to the London Foreign Office, No. 379, dated the 6th September 1932. With reference to my telegram No. 120 of the 29th August I regret to have to report that His Highness. Mirza Hassan Khan Mustaufi (Mustaufi-ul- Mamelek) died suddenly on August 28th. He had been invited to lunch at the house of a Doctor Shukuh in Shimran by Sardar Fakhir a member of the Majlis. Among the other guests were Munttufu’s great friend Sahib Ikhtiar, and Saulat-ed-Dowleh Kashgai. Apparently Mustaufi died of heart failure while playing cards before luncheon. He was only fifty-eight years of age, though his white hair and moustache made him look much older. 2. Mustaufi’s career and character are too-well known to need recital here. Though not conspicuous for force of character, he at any rate rose above the ordinary run of Persian Statesmen and enjoyed to the end a reputation for integrity. Of recent years he has played no direct part in politics, hut has enjoyed some of the esteem surrounding an Elder Statesman. He was known by the honorific title of the Agha, and alone among Persian subjects was addressed by this title by the Shah. 3. Mustaufi contrived to dissipate most of the wealth he inherited from his father, including the latter’s numerous properties in the Shimran district. He leaves a large but undistinguished, family, the offspring of a succession of wives, the last of whom a young girl, he married some six months ago. 4. The funeral took place on the day after his death, and a memorial sendee, attended by members of thg Cabinet, including the Minister of Court, by many Deputies and by a large number of Persians of all classes, was held at the Masjid-i-Shah in the afternoon of the 30th August and on the following morning. 5. All public offices were closed on the 31st August. 6. T am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.

T have the honour to report that Saulat-ed-Tauleh, Chief of the Qashqai tribe and his son Nasir Khan were arrested by the Persian government on the 30 tl. August. On the same day the Minister of the Interior dehyered a speech in the Majlis in which he reviewed the incessant efforts employed bj 1 the biah (hiring the last few years to eradicate the last traces ot the feudal regime in PeS by reducing to submission the hitherto semi-independent tribes and their chiefs while at the same time showing the greatest clemency even to those who onnosed the central authority. Such leniency could be shown, however, only as Ion- as the safetv of the State was not threatened ; if it was abused the severest measures were justifiable in order to remove those who were guilty of fomenting disorder. This precisely was what Saulat-ed-Dauleh and Ins son towards whom the greatest forbearance had been shown, were guilt} of attempting and as proof of their nefarious activities had fallen into the hands of the tioveniment the Minister requested that they should be deprived of their parliamentary immunity. The proposal was immediately approved by the Majlis and the Qashqai Chief and his son are now in prison. 2 It appears that the evidence against the prisoners was obtained largely from information supplied to the military authorities by Sirdar IWesham he Saulat’s elder brother and lifelong enemy. A few days before theJ^ulat arrest Sirdar Ihtesham called on the Acting Oriental Secretary and stated that he had been summoned by the military authorities and requested by t i give them all the information he possessed concerning the activities dmnng iue last few veab of his brother. Sirdar Ihtesham had therefore related m detail the attempts of the Saulat to cause disturbances among his h^n in iak, attempts which resulted in 1929 in the rising which had caused the (joieinm serious concern. . 3 Furthermore he had warned the military authorities that the ^ au a , was even now planning further disturbances ; that his agent was one Ilassani Firoozabadi, deputy for Shiraz, whom he had sent some tmee m earlier to Fars with letters and instructions to his tribes, and that he naci an . quite recently sent men to Fars ostensibly in connection with the attairs property but really in order to communicate further orders to his tnbesim 4. Sirdar Ihtesham stated that these messengers had been arrested an incriminating documents had been found. Sheikh Hassaa hat ** tell arrested. Moreover he had learnt on good authority that a bank diait i ^ thousand tomans issued by Soviet agents in favour of the Saulat aaa ^ into the hands of the Persian Government. He added that Soviet act ^ Fars had for some time been carried on through the agency ot the bnaiii company, but that hitherto no suspicion had been aroused that fcai ^ . g Dauleh had accented payment from the Soviet. If the story 18 at perhaps not without interest at this moment when the Persian appears to be anxious concerning the activities of Soviet agents in this78 5. His Majesty s Consul at Shiraz reports that there are no bazaar rumours or other indications that the Qashqai are unsettled and that the accusation is locally believed to be false. G. It is difficult to form an estimate of the probable effect upon the Qashqai “ ^ of the execution or exemplary punishment of the Saulat. Unlike his rival, Kawani-ul-Mulk, he has great force of character and still wields great influence among his tribesmen. The latter, however, though not completely disarmed, are disunited since the detention of their chief ; and it is therefore doubtful whether they will be able to make effective the resentment which they would undoubtedly feel. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 151) and the Acting British Consul at Shiraz (No. 11).

Despatch fuom His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 388, DATED THE 10TH SEPTEMBER \ T 932. I have the honour to report that Herr Vogel, who, as stated in my despatch No. 288-Conffdenlial, of the 18th June, was placed in charge of the National Bank when Dr. Lindenblatt left Persia, and is believed to have assumed personal responsibility for Dr. Lindenblatt’s conduct of the bank in order to facilitate his departure, disappeared a week ago. 2. It was eventually learnt that he had left for Bagdad with the passport of an Italian subject. 3. The incident, following the rumours which have been so diligently circulated largely in order to impair Teymourtache’s credit, has naturally caused a sensation and a further crop of rumours. 4. According to Teymourtache, most searching investigations have so far revealed nothing worse in the conduct of the bank than one or two extravagances such as the payment of £4,000 to a German employee who had proved unsuitable and whose contract was accordingly broken, and unwise trading such as the purchase for export of £90,000 worth of carpets which had remained unsold. However, in this matter Teymourtache is not necessarily the most reliable source of information. Indeed, I learn from Mr. Wilkinson, chief manager of the Imperial Bank, that there have been transactions which, if not fraudulent, were highly improper. But so far as he can ascertain, nothing reflecting on Teymourlache personally has been brought to light, hard though—and openly— the Minister of Finance has sought for evidence. 5. For the rest, Mr. Wilkinson informs me that there is nothing in the nature of a run on the bank, though there has in the past week been a transfer of about £20,000 worth of deposits to the Imperial Bank.

Tehran, No. 35, dated the 7th September 1932. * ■ With reference to my telegram No. 9 of this morning [Enclosure to Serial No. (57)] 1 have the honour to give an account of the situation in Fars as known to me in so far as it has some bearing upon the alleged intriomes of Sowlat-ed-Dowleh. 2. In the first^ place no rumours of any sort preceded your telegram No. 9 [Enclosure to Serial No. (57)] nor the newspaper report which followed quickly upon it. The news was apparently a complete surprise in all quarters This may indicate one of two things—either that Sowlat has not been intrigu ing with the Qashqais, or that he did so in an extremely skilful and secret manner Local opinion is strongly inclined to favour the first alternative partly basing' this upon Sowlat’s good sense and secondly upon the fact that it has been expected that some excuse would be found to ruin him still further. In any case there is no knowledge locally, nor even bazaar rumours, of any evidence of intrigues by Sowlat. • Unrest in the pro\ince of bars is widespread. There has been a gradual increase m the number of road crimes, attacks on villages and other forms of Jt 'Vi 0 doil 1 bt A truG tha t majority of these attacks are com mitted b} tribesmen—Khamseh Arabs, Qashqai and refugees from Qasht, It is an V dlCatl0n ° f V° Wmg uneasiness on the part of the authorities that although unti 1 very recently no public executions had taken place in Shiraz. rW n • ° V VVi^Vf°V robbers have been publicly shot by military firing Li Hr Vi m liew ? v hiaban-i-Saadi.

The ostensible reason is that he is to supervise the distnbution and. organisation of relief to the town whW, suffered considerably in the rams of July. There would seem to be no good grounds to suppose any other reason for his visiting Fasa except that given fnd the implication of his absence would seem to be that no complications are exacted in tins regmn Similarly the rumoured visit of the Shah to these parts within three weeks does not appear to be relevant. He is reported to be coming to y isl the Mumassam country and to have in view the founding there of a new town to be called Nasir Khosro ”. It is of course quite conceivable that he wishes to inspect personally the somewhat wayward province of Fars. tft a klu raz .d: s( di ? the townspeople, although increasingly dissatis- ^ aeav y taction and the difficulties imposed upon trade * would be unlikely to turn either to Sowlat or to the Qawam for aid even if either of these was disposed to afford assistance. Of the two Sowlat is disliked the more though both are unpopular on account of past extortions and abuses. Two sons of Sardar Ihtesham, Ami Hussain Khan and Mirza Nasrullah Khan, are resident in Shiraz but are not known to be involved in any but private affairs. 7* A cop\ of my telegram ^so. 9 to you has been sent as a savings telecram No. 1, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf together with a copy of this despatch. Sub-Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (62). Despatch fbom the Acting British Consul at Shiraz, to H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, No. 37, dated the 13th September 1932. In continuation of mv despatch No. 35 of 7th September fSub-Enclosure 1 to Serial No. (62)], I have the honour to report that I have now obtained some information concerning the alleged intrigues of the Sowlat-ed-Dowleh. This information hardly bears any higher value than that of hearsay but may be of some interest. As stated in mv previous despatch on this subject there* are no general rumours concerning the Sowlat and surprisingly little local interest has been aroused by the recent news about him. However, it is now certain that in a few local circles rumours are now circulating about letters alleged to have been sent by the Sowlat with the aim of stirring up trouble amongst the tribes. 2. One rumour is merely to the effect that the Sowlat has been in communi cation with the Boir Ahmedi instigating them to cause trouble. It is not sup ported either by arrests amongst the Boir Ahmedi or by reports .of the alleged contents of the letters. A more circumstantial rumour says that two brothers, Shaikh Mohamed Hassan and Shaikh Habibullah Muaven, the former a lawyer who took charge of the Sowlat’s cases before the Adlich and the second a teacher of the Sowlat’s sons, recently received a letter from the Sowlat-ed-Dowleh which fell into the hands of the police. The letter, so it is said, was to the effect that a large sum of money was to be transmitted for the repair of a “ qanat ”— “ not to be carried out badly as was done three years ago, but well and suffi ciently These brothers are quite legitimately agents of the Sowlat-ed- Dowleh for the maintenance of his estates, but it has been ascertained that there are no “ qanats ” on the estates needing extensive repairs. This communica- ion, couched in rather ambiguous terms, was therefore considered suspect and the two brothers have been sent under arrest to Tehran. It is also reported that a number of the Sowlat’s dependents and “ Kadkhudas ” have been sent to Tehran for examinataion. 3. As is pbyious, both these rumours may be merely local inventions, or may be perversions of some grain of truth contained in them. I should be glad to be informed whether it is desired that I should report further rumours of this kind which may come to my ears but which I am in no way able to substan tiate.mmarnma 81 Sub-Enclosure 3 to Serial No. (62).

With reference to my despatch No. 390 of September 10th [Serial No. (54)1 I have the honour to transmit to you an account of a further conversation between the Acting Oriental Secretary and General Ayrom, the Chief of Police, on the subject of Soviet activity in Persia. General Ayrom’s statements have eveiy appearance of being sincere. 2. His Majesty's Consul-General at Isfahan also reports that there are occasional echoes of Soviet propaganda in Isfahan and the neighbouring dis tricts. A little while ago, for instance, the brother-in-law of a certain Yusuf Zadeh, the dragoman of the Soviet Consulate-General, was found to be organis ing committees of young men for the purpose of distributing communistic liter ature. The brother-in-law was arrested and Yusuf Zadeh ordered to leave the country, in spite, it was said, of strong protests by the Soviet Embassy. The Soviet agents are said to be mainly employees of the Perseznaft. 3. The Tabriz manifesto which forms the subject of my despatch No. 453, dated November 1st, comes as a further commentary on General Ayrom’s state ments. 4. I am sending a copy of this, despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 220). Enclosure to Serial No. (63). Conversation between the Actiny Oriental Secretary and Genei'al Ayrom, the Chief of Police. I called on Sartip Ayrom yesterday and he again spoke at length about Soviet propaganda in Persia. He began the conversation by saying “ Haw long are the European powers gaing to allow the Soviet to carry on their propaganda so freely ? ” I asked him whether his remark implied that he had obtained further information about their activities in this country. He then stated that as a result of the discovery some weeks ago of the espionage system in Tehran and also as a result of the deportation of Soviet agents, their former organisation had been fairly effec tively broken, but that they were busy forming another intelligence and propa ganda system. He repeated that the whole Soviet representation in this countrv, from the Ambassador to the humblest officials in their trade offices were a active propaganda agents. He was doing his best to impress this fact on the■naSBBBHBBnsnCSEBSBEBQm Persian Goveriiment, but they seemed extremely reluctant to believe it. He bad found F erough] particularly difficult to persuade, but he was glad to say that he thought mt t ie Shall was Oeginning to realise the real state ot affairs. He 1 been icqucsted on one 01 two occasions to attend meetings at which Teymour- tache, Davar and the Minister for Foreign Affairs were present, to explain his case and produce proofs. He thought he had succeeded to a certain extent but the Mmisteis weie still \oiv anxious to avoid friction with the Russians. He would gi\ e the following example ol the extent to which the Soviet ag*ents could influence the Ministeis. At a meeting held a little while ago between the Soviet Ambassador, Teymourtache and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, it had been decided that So\iet tiade agents in this country should obtain their j)6f?Tiis dn sejour from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and not from the Police. This meant that the Police would have no control over Soviet agents in this country. A case in point had arisen at Meshed where the Soviet trade agency had applied to the Governor-General and obtained a permit for one of their staff without re ference to the police. Ayrom had cancelled the permit. He had flatly refused to allow Soviet employees to obtain their permits from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. He had quoted the law concerning the Residence of Foreigners in Persia and asked whether one law was to be applied to the Russians and another to all other foreigners. He had won his point much to the annoyance of the Russians who began to say that a new influence had arisen in the councils of the Persian Government ; that until recently the Government’s policy had been dictated by Teymour, but that now there were two conflicting policies. I asked Ayrom whether he could give any reason for this apparent friend liness towards the Soviet. He said that the Ministers were very anxious to make commercial agreements with the Soviet and that in their efforts to gain some small temporary commercial victory over the Soviet Government they were quite blind to the danger of Soviet propaganda in this country. Recently Teymour had mentioned with great satisfaction a profit of seven million Rials that Persia had gained through her sugar transactions. Ayrom retorted that seven hundred million would be of no use when in a few years time the country had gone Bolshevik. Ayrom continued that for some time he had urged the Government to adopt a firmer attitude towards the Soviet. It was he who had recently persuaded the Government to send a stiff reply to- a Soviet note which constituted an unwarrant able interference in Persian affairs. The arguments Ayrom used with the Persian Ministers were roughly as follow’s :— Persia was exposed to Russian attack in two ways : by military invasion, which she could not possibly hope to resist unaided ; and by economic pressure. With regard to the former, he argued that in these days of the League of Nations etcetera, the danger of military invasion was remote. In any case Persia s southern neighbour could surely not stand by and*let Persia be overrun. Economic attack, on the other hand, was already being used, but he felt sure the Soviet Government would not so far as to refuse entiie.y to trade with Persia. They v T ere now looking to the East to carry out their plans and a complete break with Persia would do no good to their chances of gaining their ends in Eastern and Moslem counntries ; besides they needed their trade with Persia and the profit derived therefrom. He thoueht therefore that there was no real danger in talcing a firm stand aarainst Soviet action in this country. He thought Ins ars-uments together v r ith his proofs of their propaganda activities weie at las having some effect on the Ministers. Ayrom continued that the Soviet were Eo”pm.ef fP-m from four of He Legations m Tehran—the Lntisn, t ie 1 uiu , t e T- nnese and the Polish. He advised us to take all precautions wi tlf otEposfand added that he was not yet eertain tiudthe Sovm did not have some agent in our Legation. But he had no pioot of this In the French Legation they were interested in me Military Attach^ or rather in a lady who was Ins tnend. Avrom claimed to be verv v T ell informed of Soviet activities to know mo^ ^ of timh secret agents etcetera. Because he was taking no active 11 Li : Lc201FD83 steps against them at present the Soviet though he was ill-informed. But his inaction was dictated by the Persian Ministers who were still afraid to risk a quarrel with the Soviet.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 428, dated the 8th October 1932. I reported in my despatch No. 388 of the 10th September [Serial No. (61)] the escape from ‘Persia of Herr Vogel, the acting chief manager of the National Bank. Herr Vogel was- detained by the authorities at Beirut for travelling on a false passport, and the Persian Government made a request for his extradition on a charge of embezzlement. At the end of last month, before the matter of extradition had been decided, Herr Vogel committed suicide at Beirut by hanging himself. There appears to be little doubt that Herr Vogel had embezzled certain sums—£6,000 is talked of. 2. Dr. Lindenblatt is now understood to be on his way back to Tehran, though he had actually retired from the National Bank. Presumably the German Govemraent has persuaded him to return for a time, in the hope that he will be able to restore confidence in the bank and in its German staff. 3. The Persian Minister to Paris, who is about to return to Tehran on the completion of his term of sendee in France, and who is' likely to be appointed chairman of a new board of the National Bank, if he will accept the post, is reported to have visited Berlin recently in connexion with the choice of another German manager for the bank. Herr Schneider has since Herr VogePs escape acted as manager of the head office here under close Persian supervision. 4. I have sent copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade [No. 0. T. (B) 224], and to His Majesty’s Acting High Commissioner at Baghdad, No. 109. (65) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 458, dated the 3rd November 1932. I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, an account taken from the “ Messager de Teheran ” of an address given recently by the Shah at one of his periodical receptions of members of the Mejliss. The accounts in the Persian press are on simitar lines and no fuller. 2. The address foreshadows the creation of a national party exclusively devoted to the good of the country and it is popularly supposed that this party will be organised on “ Fascist ” lines. 3. It may be recalled that an earlier attempt to found a party of this kind, the Iran No, came to nothing ; (see Sir R. Clive’s despatch No. 409 of August 9th, 1927, and the Annual Report for 1927)^he immediate object of the founders of that party was to inspire Persian parliamentary life with some degree ot patriotism and discipline and that object has on the whole been achieved in the Taraqqi party, the Iran No’s spiritual successor. 4. His Imperial Majesty must therefore presumably be aiming at something more profound than the mere creation of a machine to keep the Mejlis in sub servience. It remains to be seen whether or not it is beyond the power of the Shah and Teymourtache to instil into the population at large some of the ideas of duty and responsibility that are being painfully instilled into the official am military classes and to inculcate the lesson that though the first rule of patriotism, as understood in Persia, may be to oust the foreigner, the second must be to do the foreigner’s work as well as he did it. This is a formidable undertaking rendered the more so by the steadily growing discontent of which the recem developments at Tabriz, on which I am reporting in a separate despatch, are a disquieting symptom, and circumstances are likely to be too strong, even lor the Shah am] his Minister of Court.5.

The programme of the nationalists has just been published : it was wel comed by the nation : the party is increasing in number and its branches have been established in the provinces and the people have now become aware of it. The Police officials have run about and pursued—whom ? The nation. For what I Because they desire a national Government and the carrying out of the Fundamental Law, freedom of thought and public tranquility, freedom of the press and meetings, because the unemployed require work and the hungry require bread. They tight against the economic crisis and the causes of it and against dictatorship and bureaucracy and are opposed to aristocratic and con- sen ative principles. 0, fellow-countrymen ! In consideration of these conditions the nationalists have decided to declare the elections illegal and not to take pail in the elections of the 9th Majlis. The word of freedom will be published in “ Shah namehs ” as long as our meetings, publications and parties are not free, and as long- as the supporters of the national Government are being pursued as if they were criminals and traitors, and as long as lovers of freedom are being taken to the Police jails in parties, and as long as prisoners are treated as they were in the middle ages and in the times of feudalism. Taking ballots and voting will be a betrayal of the freedom and of the nation. 0 ye, mass of the oppressed people. O ye, unemployed. 0 ye, lovers of freedom (liberators), who are hidden in every corner and living in exile in ey(?ry place, slumber not. Open your eyes and under the motto “ public tranquility and freedom of thought ” unite with the nationalists. Do not fear the social parasites, because success has been and will be with us. Bind yourselves as quickly as possible with the chain of discipline and the iron order of the party, since you will, without any doubt, become victorious, and the opposers of freedom will meet with the punishment they deserve and the supporters of dictatorship and bureaucracy will come to a bad end.

Refugees :—The number of refugees escaping into Azerbaidjan increased very much in July. It is reported that the total number of refugees who crossed into this Province via Astara, Mughan, Bilasavar, the Araxes near Julfa, and Arablar is estimated at about 200, of which number about 90 per cent, are Moslem Tartars and the rest Armenians, Russians, Jews and Assyrians. While all the Christians and Jews were deported to Sulduz, etc., together with some of the Moslems, most of the Tartar refugees have found occupation, it being harvest time, in the villages of the Mughan, Ardabil, Sariab, Mishkin and Khalkhal districts and have settled there for the time being. During July there arrived here via Julfa two more groups of Armenian Orphans who recently returned to Armenia from Greece. One group was com posed of 9 persons. Among them was one who had come to the frontier with one of the former groups but had been afraid to cross the Araxes which was then very swift and so had returned to Erivan. Later he gathered 8 companions and with himself as guide they managed to make their way to the Araxes and cross the boundary safely. After being imprisoned here for a few days they were sent to the Archbishopric, where they were kept a few days and given some thing for their expenses to Sulduz. The other groups believed to be composed of 14-Id persons was brought here but was never sent to the Archbishopric. It is believed that they were deported straightway to Sulduz, without being sent to the Archbishopric as a result of Soviet pressure. It was rumoured during the closing days of July that a few Refugees were suspected of being Soviet agents and were therefore handed over to the Soviets. There was, it is said, one Armenian or Russian among them, the others being Tartars. 16. It is further reported that the Russians have cleared large areas of wood on the Russo-Persian frontier near Astara, in places where refugees most easily escaped, and have placed machine guns there to try to check the rush of refugees. Many refugees were said to have been killed there recently while attempting to enter Persia. Extract from Tabriz Political Diary No. 8, August 1932. 7. Refugees. Refugees continued to pour into Azerbaidjan and their number passed 400 in August,.a number unusual these last months. Of this number one group of armed Tartars on their way to Peisia laided a Russian village and brought into Persia some mules and live stock. Soviet tioops weie sent after them who demanded from the Persians that the\ should either find and return the mules and cattle to them or hand over the lefugees, threatening tiat in the contrary case they would themselves enter Persian tenitory to seaich for them. Upon this the Persians were much perturbed and they actually found and confiscated and gave to the Russians some of the mules and live stock m ok cr to avoid conflict with the Soviets on the frontier.

(71) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister. Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 526, dated the 10th December 1932. With reference to mv despatch No. 428 of October 8th, I have the honour to report that Mirza Hussein Khan Ala, C.M.G., until recently Persian Minister in Paris, arrived in Tehran a few days ago. I learn on first class authority that so soon as he was informed of the cancellation of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company concession, he expressed a very definite opinion that a bad blunder had been committed. 2. My informant then asked him whether he had accepted the position which had been*offered him as Chairman of the Board of the National Bank, and expressed the view that his acceptance would go far to restore confidence in the Bank. Ala replied that he had not made up his mind and explained that the reason for his hesitation was that the conditions under which the post had been offered to him required him to assume personal responsibilities for the day to day conduct of the Bank’s business, and he had not the professional knowledge which would justify him in so doing. Moreover, on his way here he had, under instructions from the Persian Government, spent some time in Germany and had selected a man of the highest standing as Doctor Lindenblatt’s successor (his name was not mentioned to me) and this gentleman was only prepared to come to Persia if he were guaranteed all proper authority to conduct the Bank’s operations without interference. 3.

Enclosure to Serial No. (73). Despatch fbom the Acting British Consul at Tabriz, No. 49, dated the 26th October 1932. In continuation of my telegram No. 14 of to-day’s date [Enclosure I to Serial No. (68)], I have the honour to inform you that on tne night of October 22nd last, i.e., the very first night after the authorities here had posted notices concerning the forthcoming elections to the new Persian Majlis, a manifesto signed by the ‘‘ National Organization of Azerbaidjan ” (Tashkilati-i-Milliyun-i- Azerbaidjan) calling on the people of Azerbaidjan to boycott the elections was secretly published and distributed here. A number of gelatine copies of this manifesto, which was a long one written in good Persian, were found affixed to doors, walls, etc., in the Lailabad quarter of Tabriz the following moniing. These copies were immediately impounded by the Police and I have therefore not been able to secure a copy to forward to you. What further action is being taken by the Police to discover and punish the authors of this anti-Government manifestation is not yet known, but it may safely be assumed that they will leave no stone unturned. A few repetitions of such bold defiance of the Government’s wishes would shake the general belief in its power to repress all signs of opposi tion, and all the latent discontent with which the province is seething would quickly find an outlet in disturbances and disorders of all kinds. 2. The manifesto, a rather long one, was strongly worded, as the following resume of its contents shows :— in “ Fellow Countrymen ! This is to inform you that the “ National Organization of Azerbaidjan ” (Tashkilat-i-Milliyun-i-Azerbaidjan) has been definitely organized and its programme drawn up. It has many branches all over Azerbaidjan. Its aim is liberty as understood by civilized peoples, including freedom of the press, freedom of-speech, freedom of meet ings, etc., of all of which we are so cruelly deprived ”. &lt;&lt; The Police are directed against us and many of our beloved leaders and associates have been exiled and imprisoned. Others are kept under observation and subjected to searching examination. Mho are the Police hunting down ? The Nation. W hy ? Because it wants to live as a nation ”. “As a counter-stroke to all this persecution we have decided to boycott the forthcoming elections for the Majlis, because taking part m elections under such conditions is betraying the nation. Yv e there fore call upon you to abstain from taking part m these elections . 3. The manifesto concludes with an appeal to the oppressed classes framed he usual phraseology of Bolshevik propaganda, for examp e . “ And von, fellow workers, you, the oppressed, von who ^dure nameless hardships for a piece of black bread, without wovk ’ ’ y 1 ® starved, uncertain what to-morrow holds for you. come unite and stand by us against the bureaucracy, the tyranny, etc., etc. .These words suggest that as far as the constitution of the “ National Organization of Azerbaidjan ” and the wording of its manifestos is concerned, the Bolsheviks have at least a finger in the pie. 4. In the Tabriz Political Diary of February 1932 and previous months reference was made to an anti-Govermnent organization which has been formed in Tabriz. It is not yet certain whether this manifesto is the work of this anti- Government organization or whether the “ National Organization of Azerbaid jan ” is yet another separate and independent body aiming at opposing and embarrassing the present regime in this province.

Despatch from His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 481, dated the 18th November 1932. In continuation of previous reports upon conditions in Luristan, I have the honour to report that the despatch of four squadrons of cavalry and three battalions of infantry was recently deemed necessary, presumably in order to ensure the safe passage of the Shah, who has recently been visiting Khuzistan, through the Dizful-Khurramabad-Burujird area. The force was under the command of Sartip Murteza Khan. 2. There are numerous reports, not as yet definitely confirmed, that this force was attacked by the Lurs and suffered heavy losses, including a very senior officer. The Shah has now returned to Tehran without mishap, but not before further reinforcements had been sent from Tehran. 3. I enclose an extract from the diary of His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah for October, giving some interesting details about the situation. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch, without the enclosure, to His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah (No. 69). Enclosure to Serial No. (75). Extract from Kermanshah Diary No. 10 for October 1932. (No. 205. Confidential.) Lurs. The situation with regard to the tribesmen had not improved during most of the month, and it is only in the last days that the authorities appear to have been endeavouring to get a firmer grip of the situation in the nearer districts of Duru-Faraman, Harsin, &amp;c. These remarks apply particularly to the Bairanawand and, in some measure, to the Kakawand sub-tribes, which have been mainly responsible for the unrest in this area. There were indications of tribal activity near the Kermanshah-Hamadan road early in the month, and an amnieh guard is reported to have been kihed near Bidsorkh, the scene of the act of brigandage in which the American consular officers figured last month. To meet this danger one guruhan of the Kermanshah Regiment was despatched to the area and another gutuhan, then at Harsin, was moved north to join it and’ to clear the country in between.'*Tr* C 90 Reports of attacks on villages in the Harsin and Duru-Faraman districts were prevalent during the month and some villages were evacuated bv the Ahmadawand The looting of the village of Geshan was reported here on the Gh October, and further reports of such altacks were also received It is said that villagers are able to buy back their cattle on payment of a small sum per head, such payments securing immunity from further molestation. Mr. F. M. Stead, an American citizen, and husband of the late Dr Stead wrote to His Majesty’s consul on the 12th October, from his villao-e-farm of Faraman, that the Bairanawand were active in the district and asked to be supplied with rifles. The Governor, to whom the request was transmitted regretted that no arms could be furnished, and suggested that Mr. Stead should come into Kermanshah for the time being. The latter did not take this advice. Troops had meanwhile reached his area and arms appear to have been issued to the Ahmadawand' of the district. Arrests of Lurs and seizures of rifles were made throughout the month, three men with one rifle being found at Kuh-i-Sefid, near Kermanshah, on the 3rd October, whilst Farajullah Khan Sar-i-Arsalan, the owner and governor of Kangavar. arrested three Lurs with two rifles and a load of ammunition. Another haul of fifteen rifles was brought to Kermanshah on the 11th October. These were found in the village of Khoda Bandalu, to the north of Sahnah, and appear to have been a dump made by the Lurs. Some of the Kurd villagers were arrested in this connexion. Lur prisoners reached Kermanshah on the 7th and 9th October. These men, numbering fifteen, are stated to have formed part of a band of twenty-two persons engaged by the troops on the 7th October, when the other seven were killed. This band is held responsible for tbe death of the amnieh guard, reported above. Another guruhan of the Kermanshah Bcgiment was despatched to the Kakawand area on the 12th October, under Yavar Arshad-es-Saltaneh, and was stationed at Kaleh Gandjewan, to the south-west of Harsin. Two lorries were requisitioned on the 16th October for the despatch of more troops and material to Sahnah. Fighting was reported in the area south of Harsin in the third week of October, in which the troops sustained some losses, but the numbers are hot known. The position towards the end of fhe month appears to have been that the four units of the Kermanshah Regiment in the Harsin-Duru-Faraman area (the cavalry squadron under Sultan Abbas Khan at Sar Firuzabad, one guruhan at Kaleh Ganjewan and two other sections of infantry at places unknown) were ordered to advance to the Gizawand district, to the south-east of Harsin, where the rebel Bairanawand and Kakawand were reported to have collected. The move was timed for the 25th October and the converging movement of these four sections was to be completed by the night of the 27th October. The cavalry from Sar Firuzabad is reported'to have been accompanied by 150 Kurds armed by the military. Requisitions of pack transport were made in Kermanshah and neighbour hood on the 27th October, the owners of the animals being refused permission to accompany them. No report of the effect of the above movement was obtainable, but it would appear that no contact was obtained and that the military were satisfied with the occupation of a line cutting off the Lurs from the north. There is a rumour, which lacks confirmation, that the Lurs are led by a colonel of the army, who is dissatisfied with the present regime. The military at Kermanshah are reported to estimate the rebels at some 900 men, of whom less than half have rifles.

Despatch prom His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, Xo. 276, dated the 3k T December 1932. I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of despatches, as .M £ marked below, which I have addressed to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. (Xo. 567 of 29th December 1932.) Enclosure to Serial Xo. (77). Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, Xo. 567, dated the 29th December 1932. I indicated in my telegram Xo. 244 of December 27th [Serial Xo. (66) in File Xo. 373-N.|32], that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had very little informa tion to give on the subject of the dismissal of Teymourtache from his functions as Minister of Court. I did not think it worth while to telegraph that he hazarded the indecisive opinion that the main reason was the Shah’s dissatis faction at his continuing to associate with Diba after his dismissal (see my despatch Xo. 508 of December 2nd). 2. It appears, however, that the Diba connection is to be at least the official version, as the Minister of War, who is not usually very voluble, told a long story last night to the effect that the presence of Diba at the Court had always been distasteful to the Shah who had made his views known to Teymourtache without obtaining any response. 3. Finally the Shah plainly intimated to Teymourtache that he did not want to see Diba again and he waited patiently for some considerable time for Teymourtache to give effect to his wishes. There was still no response and so His Majesty was compelled to take action himself, and having taken action, ihe Shah hoped that Teymourtache would cease to be on intimate terms with a man who was notoriously disreputable (This is true, even by Persian standards) ; to make sure, however, he instructed the Police to report Teymourtache’s move ments, and to his indignation he learnt that the intimacy between the Teymourtache and the Diba family continued- This, we are to understand, was an assertion of individual liberty which could not be brooked, and the Shah instructed his personal secretary to inform Teymourtache that his presence was no longer required at the Court- Teymourtache thereupon requested the Minister of War to intercede on his behalf and a replv came back that the Shah desired him not to leave his house for a fortnight, that he appreciated the services wdiich he had rendered, but that for political reasons he could not, for the present, be entrusted with any official functions. Xonetheless the Shah would be very glad to see him and receive his advice on political matters at frequent intervals. 4. There is in all this one thing that I know to be a fact, v'xz., that Teymourtache w r ent to the cinema with Diba and his wife on the day, or the day after, that Diba w r as dismissed. For the rest, the story can be accepted but only as an act of faith. 5. There are, of course, many other stories :— one of the most civilised Persians of my acquaintance appears to believe that Teymourtache has fallen into disgrace because he has shown himself too favourable to British interests and has accepted money from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company ; others maintain that the affairs of the Xational Bank are the main cans*? • of the trouble and they have, in support of their opinion, the fact tha (as reported in my despatch Xo. 352 [Serial Xo. (44)], Teymourtacne undoubtedly had an extremely unpleasant interview with the Shah m August, after the investigations into the affairs of the Bank had been in progress for two months ; another theory is that the Shah is becoming anxious about his son future, not being over confident of his own expectation of life- # accordingly decided that Teymourtache was too prominent and tna a regency in which Teymourtache would inevitably play the leadiRo part would be a short one ;y t m ’ s th f t’; 1 : Shah has suddenly made up his mind that T p ^urtache has, for his own ends, delayed a settlement both with \? 0 T ern J r l? nt and with ^le Soviet Government and has “ ' hi ought about the one result which Persia should avoid, i.e., uneasy relations with both Powers ; final Court martial 1 ^ Teymourtache and I)ib a are to be haled before a 6. I daresay that many factors have contributed something to the Shah’s decision ; I do not however believe that the Shah would have dismissed his Mmistei of Court if he had felt entirely happy as to the outcome of the cancella tion of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company concession. t. On learning the news of Teymourtache’s dismissal I wrote him a short personal note indicating my regret at the severance of our official relations and Faying that the discussions on the subject of the general treaty which we had had would remain a happy memory, sorry though I was that we had been unable to reach a final conclusion- 1 received a cordial reply in which Teymourtache expressed his appreciation of the efforts which I had made to solve outstanding questions. 8. It is believed that the Shah does not intend to attempt to find a substitute for Teymourtache hut will now act more directly as his own Prime Minister and always he accessible to members of the Government. The prospect is rather alarming as it seems likely that in some cases irrevocable decisions, such as that cancelling the d’Arcy concession, will be lightly taken and that in others no decision whatsoever will he obtainable ; it is noteworthy that since Taghi Zadeh shook off the yoke of Teymourtache and obtained real control of the Ministry of Finance the Ministry of Foreign Affairs finds it impossible when called upon to intervene on behalf of a foreign mission, to get anything done. 9. It must be imagined that the Shah realizes that Teymourtache is the only swan amongst his flock of geese and I therefore hope that*what I have called the official version is so far true that His Majesty will not take against him any extreme measures which would render his return to a position of authority impossible. (78) Telegram XX, from H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, No. 2, DATED THE 6 tH JANUARY 1933. (REPEATED TO GOVERNMENT OF INDIA and Baghdad, No. 1 Saving.) Opposition fostered by Teymourtache against Soviet trade methods has recently taken the form in Gilan of picketing latter’s offices to prevent individual operations. This development has almost certainly been inspired by the Govern ment. It is significant that Director of Department of Commerce recently visited Resht where Governor is reputed to be anti-Russian. 2. Soviet Embassy is said to have issued ultimatum threatening stoppage of all Russian purchases and closure of trade organizations in Gilan if boycott not raised within three days- There have since been meetings between Minister for Foreign Affairs and Russian Trade Representative. 3. It is believed that Persian Government -will give way gradually in order to save their face and at same time strive to secure partial Russian recognition of Persian policy of trade centralization on lines adumbrated in Commercial Secretary’s reports. See particularly his despatch Xo. 279 to the Department of Overseas Trade which left by bag of January 1st. 4. Situation appears similar to that reported in Clive’s despatch Xo. 337 of July 15th, 1930 [Enclosure to Serial Xo. (33) in File Xo. 1-N.|30], and connected correspondence. (79) Despatch from IIis Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 11, dated the 12th January 1933. With reference to my telegram No. 2 of the 6th instant, I have the houmn to inform von that on December 22nd, the merchants of Gilan enforced a regular boycott of the Russian trading and transport organizations, pushing ieir/ 93 truculence so far as to picket the latter’s offices and prevent—not without a few broken heads—all access to their offices. The lorries of Bureau Perse were apparently allowed neither to leave their garage nor to enter it, the drivers being forced to dump in the roadway the goods they had brought from the interior. The methods employed were, it seems, after the best Hindu passive resistance precedents, men lying down in front of the lorries so as to make it impossible for them to move- 2. This boycott was undoubtedly the culmination of the efforts which the late Minister of Court made throughout the summer to persuade Persian merchants in general that it would be to their advantage in the long run to show a united front against Soviet Russia’s trade methods, which were as calamitous to the individual merchant as they were insulting to the dignity of the State. The members of the Iran Trading Corporation were egged on by the promise that all commercial transactions with Soviet Russia would be centralized in their hands should the movement prove successful. The Director of the Department of Commerce spent the week ending December 17th in Gilan and he was reported at the time to have advised the merchants to have no individual dealings with the Russians. It is almost certain that he gave the final touch to the plans for the boycott previously laid by Teymourtache. (I hear in this connection Yassai received a most violently worded letter from the Russian Trade Repre sentative two days ago protesting against his recent activities in Gilan and laying the organization of the boycott at his door—to which Yassai has perforce given the lie.) It is also rumoured that the police of Gilan provided some of the pickets mentioned above on the instructions of the Tehran police head- quarters ; while the local Governor, Divanbegi, a creature of Teymourtache, is said to have shown himself rabidly anti-Russian. He has since been recalled to Tehran, but I am unaware whether for consultation or as a sacrifice to Russian wrath. 3. According to a source which should be reliable the Russian reaction took the form of three ultimata which were delivered on January 1st :— (a) The agent of the Russian Trade Representative in Gilan was ordered to inform the Governor that if the boycott was not called off before January 5th, all Russian trade organizations in Gilan would be closed forthwith and the personnel sent back to Russia. (b) Yassai was informed that all Russian purchases would cease if the boycott continued. (c) The Chief of the Tehran Municipality, who is also Comptroller- General to the Shah, was informed that in view of the transport difficulties resulting from the boycott there would be no ship avail able to transport the rice which the Russians had hitherto agreed to buy from His Majesty—one understands the whole of his substantial crop, while no other Persian rice of this year’s output has been bought in Gilan or Mazanderan up to now, to the intense distress of these two provinces. 4. The third ultimatum, if it can be called that, was withdrawn at the last moment “so as not to embitter the conflict ”, the Russians realizing perfectly well that the threat would already have produced its effect. 5. The boycott, it will be noted, took place in spite of the Minister of Court’s dismissal—probably because nobody had thought of altering or delaying the execution of orders already given—but his absence must have been keenly felt when the Council of Ministers met on January 2nd in the presence of the Shah to discuss the situation. 6. It was finally agreed according to my informant that instructions should be telegraphed to local governors to take no part in the boycott, the official attitude of the Government being a neutral one, and at the same time (one imagines) to exert a restraining influence on the merchants. Feroughi and yassai were also detailed to interview the Russian Trade Representative, showing themselves conciliatory but to give ground slowly in an endeavour to save the Persian Government’s prestige and obtain all possible concessions. Tins policy was, very possibly, laid down by Teymourtache who must have foreseen the result of the boycott he advocated with a view to bringing matters to a head. The shadow of the Minister of Court still hangs over the Cabinet. 7. A report which reached the Legation subsequently w T as to the effect that tins interview, which took place on the 3rd January, proved most satisfactory tno I ersians telegraphing to Resht to put an end to the boycott in its active andaggressive form—although the merchants are presumably still expected to refrain from dealing with the Russians individually—while the latter wired instructions to Baku to send a boat to pick up the Shah’s rice ! It is also rumoured that on the main 1 ersian desideratum has already been secured : the liussians ha\ ing agreed to guarantee an annual purchase of certain minimum quantities.ot Persian rice, cotton and dried truits at stipulated prices. Nothing, hov ever, is said of the Russian willingness to abstain from buying the other Persian products which they have formed the habit of marketing outside Russia. 8. The Persian idea that a clearing house—to be organized perhaps by the National Bank--should be formed to handle all Russo-Persian trade erchanges has also been subject of discussion but it seems that the Russian Trade Representative has raised certain practical objections which the Persian autho rities themselves recognize as cogent. The latter in any case are very hopeful that a new agreement will be reached with the Russians before the* end of January. AYhat part the Iran Trading Corporation will play in it, if any, it is impossible at this stage to predict. 9. 1 attach a note by the Commercial Secretary which deals with the con flicting Persian and Russian views of the trade balance between the two countries. 10. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the Department of Overseasi Trade [No. (). T. (B) 4], the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 6), and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 3). Enclosure to Serial No. (79). Confidential., * 1 Russo-Persian trade differences. I hear from a confidential and reliable source that the Russians, a few days prior to the Minister of Court’s dismissal on December 24th, were given import licences to the substantial value of Rials 70 million (say £700,000). This seemed surprising in view of the declaration made to me by the Director of the Depart ment of Commerce on my return from leave (my memorandum of November 17, forwarded to the Foreign Office under printed letter No. 491, paragraph 3) that the Russians would obtain no more licences until they had settled outstanding accounts, and the more so when the news came in of the boycott of Russian com mercial organizations in Gilan which set in on December 22nd. One can only assume that this boycott being intended to secure certain concessions from the Russians, the Persians wished to emphasize the fact that they could be pleasant in other directions when they felt so inclined. These import licences were applied mainly to prints, voiles and muslins (quota No. 15), cotton thread, leather, drugs, oil paints, candles, glassware, paper, cardboard, galoshes and linoleum—thereby exhausting the quotas in respect of these commodities set aside for the Russians. 1 am also told that the latter up to date have taken up 78 per cent, of their quotas for cement, iron, chemicals and machinery, and 30 pei cent, of all othei quotas assigned to them. On the aggregate they ha\ e taken up no more than 5(i per cent, of their 51.1 per cent, share of the import quotas for the whole country from all sources, of which they have themseKes dealt with 5-. per cent., leaving the remaining 4 per cent, to Persian meichants. As reported in my memorandum of November 17, commercial exchanges between the two countries from the introduction of the trade monopoly (Februarv 27, 1931) to September 22nd, 1932—ninefeen months m all-resulted, according to the Persian figures, in an adverse balance to Persia of 25.6 million rials During the next two months this adverse balance increased to 33.3 million rials t£333,000) to which the first five months of the current economic year (June-November 1932) contributed over half : 17.5 million rials. The Persian Government have recently decided, it appears, to put aside for the moment the difference of 15116 million rials incurred before June 1932 and to gTve the Russians until June 1933 to clear up the al eged deficit of 1,4 million rials incurred since June 1932, failing which they will receive no more import licences this year, . It is very improbable that the Russians wJl adjust the trade balance on the basis of Chose purely Persian figures, so that Soviet Russia, if the PersianGovernment adhere to their latest decision, would import during the current year no more than 56 per cent, of the quotas earmarked for them. According to Article X of the Russo-Foreign Treaty of Commerce (see last two paragraphs of Section 1) it is only in the event of the Russians apply ing for a reduction in their quotas before the end of the first half year which they have not done as far as we know—that the surplus can be made available for other importers, excepting sugar and matches of course which come under special agreements. Failing such advice the Persian authorities would obviously not be able to gauge until the very end of the economic year the surplus avail able for outside distribution, but it might be added to the non-Russian quotas already decided upon for the following year. This is, however, very improbable in practice and the state of trade is so bad that it would probably not be wanted in any case. It is interesting to compare the official Soviet statistics for the trade of the Union with Persia, as quoted in the enclosure to Moscow despatch No. 64.9 of November 16th, with the Persian figures in our possession. According to the former the first eight months of 1932 resulted in a balance favourable to Persia amounting to 24,502 thousand roubles, Russian exports to Persia havin'* decreased by 19.7 per cent, while Persian imports into Soviet Russia were 34.5 per cent, higher. 1 have no idea which of the two sets of figures is likely to be the less unreliable.

I learn on fairly good authority that Shah stamped into Council of Ministers on January 7th having with him preliminary Budget figures. After roundly abusing Ministers he called in the President of the Majlis who was waiting out side and ordered him to note that any proposal for expenditure of any sort was to be rejected out of hand. Minister for Foreign Affairs attempted to reason with him the next day without result.

No. 706 of 15th December, 1931. Enclosure to Serial No. (1). Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, No. 706, DATED THE 15TH DECEMBER 1931. With reference to Mr. Dodd’s despatch No. 566 of October 7th, enclosing a translation of certain regulations for the enforcement of the Marriage Law of August 13th (see Mr. Dodd’s despatch No. 470 of August 28th), I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a translation of certain additional regulations regard ing the registration of marriages. 2. In addition the following single article was approved by the Council pf Ministers on the 3rd October :— “ La juridiction competente pour conclure des manages entre les res- sortissants etrangers et les femmes persanes, sera, dans les provinces persanes, le gouvemeur, et a 1’Etanger, le fonctionnaire du consulat de Perse.” (The translation is from the “ Messenger de Teheran ”). This decision appears to mean that lex-loci marriages performed abroad, to which a Persian woman is a party, will not in future be recognised in Persia. 3. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Government of India, His Majesty’s High Commissioner for ’Iraq, and His Majesty’s Consular Officers in Persia. Sub-Enclosure.

( 2 ) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 410, dated the 16th December 1931. I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of despatches, as marked below, which I have addressed to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Despatch No. 713, dated 16th December 1931. Enclosure to Serial No. (2). Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, No. 713, DATED THE 16TH DECEMBER 1931. The recent trial and sentence of Amir Lashkar Habibullah Khan Shaibani (see “ Persian Biographies ” old No. 36) for a military offence committed while in command of the Persian troops in Fars in 1930 have caused a great deal of interest in Tehran Political circles. The story which is normally accepted is that the Amir4 Lashkar in the summer of 1930 attached, the I^ofr Ahmc di and Mamasani tribes in Fars with all the forces at his disposal but neglected to take the elementary pre caution of sending out scouts to reconnoitre a certain pass named the (Ta Muradi) defile before advancing through it; that in consequence his troops (who consisted for the most part of new recruits) were ambushed and about five hundred were killed * and that the consequent loss of prestige, with its repercussions in frighten- ine young Persians from joining the Army as conscripts, led to the Amir Lashkar’s recall to Tehran, followed by his trial by a military court and a sentence of two year’s imprisonment and the loss of all Ins nnhtaiy lank and titles. There is of course no doubt in any one’s mind that His Majesty the Shah ordered the punish ment of the officer who was up to 1930 one of his most treated advisers. 2 I have recently heard another version of the matter. The story came to me at third hand, and I cannot reach for its truth, but it is just as interesting if it is fiction. 3. A friend of the Amir Lashkar’s went recently to call on him and to take him some books to read in prison. We found Shaibani accommodated in a special room and treated with unusual respect; he was allowed to receive visitors and to talk with them freely without supervision. The visitor mentioned that he had heard that Shaibani had been condemned for an error of judgment. The Amir Lashkar laughed and said that he had made no error i that in fact he had the Shah s definite order to attack the tribe at whatever cost. The real reasons why the judgment (which was not a judgment at all but was simply an order by the Shah) had been given was because His Majesty had heard that in two or three recent conversations (which had reached the Shah’s ears) English representatives had praised Shaibani and said that he was a good general; and consequently the Shah became suspicious of him. If Shaibani is right, our power for good or evil is in Persian military affairs almost unlimited. 4. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s High Ccmmissioner for Iraq. (3) Memorandum from the British legation, Tehran, No. 418, dated the 29th December 1931. His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the subject of Sharq’s Tehran show rooms. Mr. Lingeman’s despatch No. Overseas Trade (B) 229, dated December 29, 1931, Copy to His Majesty’s Acting High Commissioner for ’Iraq under P. L No. 201, dated December 29, 1931. Enclosure to Serial No. (3). Despatch from the Commercial Secretary, British Legation, Tehran, to the Department of Overseas Trade, No. Overseas Trade (B) 229, dated the 29th December 1931. I have the honour to inform you that I visited, a few days ago, the show rooms which the Soviet trading company Sharq have opened this winter in one of t e main thoroughfares of Tehran. I was accompanied by Mr. Legatto Wood, e representative of the Dunlop Rubber Company who knows Russian extreme y well. We had no cause to divulge our identity. 2. It is certainly a very pretentious affair according to Persian standards, my rough estimate of the total floor area being 15,000 square feet. The bun mgj the whole of which is taken up by Sharq, belongs to the Shah who exacts a ren ^ of 500 Tomans per month, an expenditure which I should have thought ^ unwarranted, judging by the number of people who seem to visit the P ^ ‘ myself saw no more than two or three Russians there mLo looked like emp °75 A of some other Soviet conceni and an Armenian family out for a holiday. Shafq nevertheless allege that the building is not large enough for their requirements aS the Shah at their request has undertaken to build a second one for them at the back. Some of my Persian friends suggest that this is merely to please and impress l T ?l them P ° intS t0 the ^ that have ^just bought 240 000 poods of his rice—equivalent to some 3,600 tons—of the new cron m spite of the fact that the Soviet Government have placed an official embargo o P n the entry of this year s rice into the territory of the Pnion until it has had time to haiden. (Pefore the conclusion of the Commercial Treaty, it will be remembered the Russians refused to buy any Persian rice at all at a time when there were lar&lt;&gt; e stock left over from last year not even from His Majesty who was obviously in tended to learn the lesson that it pays to be on good terms with the buyers of one’s products.) ^ 3. On the first floor one sees samples of chemicals, paints, leather, pack saddlery and shoes, woodwork, cheap cutlery, office requirements, garish lamp shades, shawls of \vhat appeared to be artificial s Ik, hosiery, Pahlavi hats ready made clothing including sports clothes, thread, a room full of cotton prints and other piece goods including fine linen, preserves, wines and liquors, mineral waters, biscuits and sweets, sugar, seeds, cigarettes, toys, hollow- ware and hardware, china, matches, candles, soap and other toilet requisites, perfumery, medical supplies. Of these I w r as particularly struck by the appear ance of the preserves, wines, liqueurs, and more especially the perfumery and the drugs, the packing of which looked perfect. 4. Another section on the first floor is set aside for gramophones and string instruments, oil products and wood, an insurance stand with graphic representations in cardboard of all the accidents that may befall man and his goods and chattels ; the whole set off with propaganda stands depicting the industrial development taking place in the Soviet Union and the welfare of the masses, the inevitable portraits oi Lenin draped in red calico, and notices in Russian and Persian reminding one that handshaking is a thing of the past. 5. On the ground floor are exhibited road making, electrical, agricultural, dairy and weighing machines the finish of the heavy machinery being very rough, it seemed to me,—lathes and other machine tools, a whole room full of sewmg machines, telephones, attractive wireless sets and electrical contractors supplies. 6. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Govern' ment of India and His Majesty’s Acting High Commissioner for ’Iraq.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated the 19th December 1931. Despatch from His Majesty’s Legation Athens, to the Foreign Office, No. 595 (201/33/31), dated the 4th December 1931. I have the honour to inform you that on receipt of your despatch No. 430 (E.-5177/5177/34) of October 26th, relative to the claim of Monsieur Dracos Pil des, a Greak national, against the Persian Government for compensation for destruction of property at Lahijan, I enquired of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs whether they wished His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran to take the matter up with the Persian Government. I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of a Note Verbale from the Hellenic Government in reply to my enquiry. Enclosure in Serial No. (4). COPIE Ministers Des Affaires Etrangeres. No. 15621. Le Ministere des Affaires Etrangeres a eu 1’honneur de recevoir la ^Note Verbale No. 295 (201/31/31) du 19 courant et s’empresse d’exprimer sesplusvifs remerci- ments a la Legation de Sa Majeste Britannique pour son aimable communication •MC148FD2. It may be that the scenery which met Mr. Assarsson’s roving eye when he reached the Persian plateau on his way to Tehran prejudiced him from the start. He certainly informed the official of the Ministry of National Economy who was detailed to assist him in his business activities no more than two days after his arrival that if the match monopoly had really been given to the Russians he might as well return to Sweden without further ado ; the only consideration that might conceivably make him stay being the possibility of securing Persian army clothing contracts. Mr. Assarsson, I should explain, is acting as Swedish Consul General in the absence on leave of Mr. Carlberg, the representative of the Swedish Match Company, but whether or not it was merely in his consular capacity that he was so interested in the Persian match monopoly I am unable to say. 3. Mr. Assarsson is still in Tehran at the time of writing but his feelings, until very recently at all events, have undergone no change. He has lost no opportu nity of referring to Persia in much the same strain as the British Tommy is reputed to have described the Mesopotamian landscape during the War. He has told all and sundry Persian merchants that he would have nothing to do with them, hint ing very broadly that he regarded them as unmitigated thieves and scallywags although he must have done so not only from conviction but also from policy, to hide the fact that he was dealing with one Persian firm, Messrs. Kooros Brothers. He has as good as told the Ministry of National Economy that his principals were grossly taken in by that arch rogue Arbab Keikhusrau and that he himself would never have come out here had he had the slightest inkling of what Persian trading and living conditions really were. He was prepared to buy Persian products but let the Government first find them for him and build decent roads to allow him to export. He has had one quarrel after another with Yasai and his minions which Davar, the Minister of Justice (who in the absence of Teymourtache is ex pected to keep the Persian economic house of cards from collapsing) has vainly tried to patch up. 4. The climax was reached a few days ago when Yasai informed Mr. Assarsson that having already imported fourteen kilos of ryvita he would not be allowed to import any more, lest the Trade Monopoly Law (which prohibits the import of foodstuffs) be strained to breaking point. Mr. Assarsson thereupon informed the Ministry of National Economy for at least the tenth time that he proposed to leave Tehran within a quarter of an hour. On this occasion, however, he alleged that he had telegraphed to Stockholm to stop all shipments and added that he would see the Shah before he went. As His Majesty is reported to have been exceedingly gracious to him during his first interview, being greatly enamoured of the Swedish barter scheme, and having promised Mr. Assarsson his every support, Yasai, who is also desperately anxious to become a full fledged Minister, took fright. A commission was hastily formed to enquire into the facilities that might be accorded to Mr. Assarsson and it was decided that the Persian Government should meet one of his chief complaints by granting him export certificates against all his ex ports. At the same time, I gather, a telegram was sent to Director Anderson referring to Mr. Assarsson a choleric and impulsive tempe-ament and suggesting, m the interest of harmonious relations, that he were best replaced. 5. This concession is obviously a very important one, particularly if the price of export certificates does not fall below the present level of 22j%. It must enable the Swedes to reduce their losses on their exports of Persian produce very appreciably, particularly if they buy shrewdly and at their leisure. Their pur chases so far have been in the nature of trial orders, amounting to roughly 200,000 Tomans or about £26,000 in all (carpets, lambskins, gum tragacanth, raisins, quince seeds) of which half through Kooros Bros, and half through Petag, a German carpet firm established in Tabriz (who, if my information is correct, have been palming off carpets at 30% above the ordinary market rates). Mr. Assarsson, however, has already discovered that he is up against the Russians m whichever direction he turns and he must realize, moreover, that he will find very little to ship if he restricts himself to products which can be disposed of abroad at a small profit no inore than a small loss. It should be remembered in this connection that the Swedes sell their goods to the Persian Government on a dollar basis, which dollars are converted into Krans at 18|, as compared with a bazaar rate of 22 krans tothe dollar, so that they lose the best part of 19% on their exchange. It has natu rally been Mr. Assarsson’s policy to have this clause in the trade agreement revised, to maintain in fact that he must be given not only export certificates but also the full bazaar rate for his dollars if “ the very reasonable profit ” the syndicate is making on its sales to the Persian Government is not to be entirely swallowed up. I understand that a favourable view has been taken of his respresentations and that it is in this connection that the Minister of Court has gone to Stockholm. 6. I very much suspect, however, that Mr. Assarsson, who has had thirty years in the 'United States, has set out to bluff the Persians from the beginning. One felt, as soon as the terms of the agreement became known, that the Swedes would never have accepted payment in krans, to be exported in the form of Per sian produce, unless they had stiffened their quotations for machinery etcetera, very considerably. I have been told confidentially by a person who is in close touch with Mr. Assarsson that this is actually the case. The Chief of the Railway Department on the other hand, who accompanied Arbab Keikhusrau on his mission to Sweden, tells me that the Persian Government consider themselves fully gua ranteed as to quality by the survey reports of Messrs. Robert Hunts of Ludgate Hill, London, and as to the 'price by the certificate of the Swedish State Railways that the prices charged by the syndicate are no higher than those which the Swe dish State Railways would be prepared to pay themselves. His Majesty’s Com mercial Counsellor at Stockholm maj be in a position to state what value one should attach to the second of these guarantees. 7, Both the Minister of Roads and Communications, who granted me an interview yesterday, and Bader, the Chief of the Railway Department whom I saw this mcming, assured me that the Persian Government were in no way committed to the purchase in Sweden of the railway material they might need to import, Path Swedish offer would be judged on its merits, being carefully compared with the offers received from other countries, and Kazemi emphasized the point by saying that some Swedish offers already been turned down and the orders placed elsewhere, payment being effected in foreign currency. The Government would not let themselves be hypnotized, as I suggested might be the case, by the fact that the Swedes accepted payment in krans. Bader, who strikes me as an ex ceedingly shrewd little man—he was educated at Harrow and Caius and served as Chief Accountant of the Ministry of Finance under the Millspaugh regime, during which time he is commonly reported to have done extremely well for himself— told me that he thought the Swedish prices very reasonable on the whole. Even when reckoned in dollars pure and simple they were sometimes below the compe tition. He considered that the Persian Government had struck a first class bar gain with the Swedes but, as the Minister had already said to me, that need not prevent the Government from welcoming British offers. I am reporting separately on the arrangements it behoves us to make in this connection. 8. I have no information as yet regarding the nature of the shipload of Swedish goods that has reached Bandar Shapur, nor of the one reported to be on the way, apart from that contained in Stockholm despatch No. Overseas Trade (B) 380 of 80th October last to the effect that these two shipments consisted mainly of cement. The nature and number of future shipments will very largely depend; (&lt;*) on the new agreement which Teymourtache will conclude in Stockholm ; [h) its feasibility in practice with particular reference to the amount of Persian pro ducts which the Swedes can ship with a profit on the dual transaction ; and (c) the railway policy of the Persian Government. Bader informed me in the latter connection that a new programme had been elaborated which foresaw the com pletion of the northern section as far as Tehran in five years at a cost of 25 '30 million tomans, so that substantial orders for material of all sorts would have to-be placed abroad. The question of curves and gradients had not yet been finally decided but they would be narrower and steeper respectively—for economy s sake— than in the German plans ; which meant that the trace would also need to be altered slightly here and there. The Swedish engineers, of whom there were already a dozen in the North (under Shodahl, Kruger’s chief railway engineer, who has been recently employed in Turkey) were responsible for both construction and survey, while the already constructed Aliabad-Bandar Shah line would remain in charge of Persian engineers. I enquired whether the railway might be expecto reach Tehran in six years from the South also, but Bader stated that this ques tion had not been gone into very carefully up to date ”, that would depend on the money available and the trouble experienced in piercing through the mountains ol Lunstan. At the moment the Government were bent on completing the im provements to the Bandar Shapur—Dizful line and extending it northwards to the extent of 50 km. 9. I am informed confidentially that the Government propose to double the present monopoly tax of two krans a batman on sugar, for the benefit of the rail way fund. This would represent the profit to be made by the Government on the sugar it is to buy from the Russians and resell to the wholesalers. 10. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Foreign Secretarv to the Government of India and His Majesty s Acting High Commissioner for ‘Iraq. A ote : Reference paragraph 5.—The price of export certificates has since fallen to 18% owing to the closure of the list for applications for import licences in respect of the period January-June 1932, but this is purely provisional as a new- list reopens on Nu Ruz. The Russians are also expected to increase their pur chases enormously in anticipation of the enforcement of the Commercial Treaty. On the other hand it is all to the good of other importers that the exports effected by the Swedes from Persia should be made available for the importation of other goods than Swedish railway material, in contravention of the principle of the trade balance. It is the Russians, however, who held the key to the situation. Reference paragraph ^.—According to the statement made by a deputy in the Mejlis a few days ago which met with no ministerial denial the Government have credited the Swedish account with the National Bank with two million tomans, or 1,051,081 # @ 18|, presumably in cover of the first Swedish shipments. I am told that the Persians w anted to elaborate a four year programme for the completion of the northern line to Tehran but that the Swedes pointed out that they could not ship sufficient Persian products in the time to finance the importation of the required material. The figure of 25/30 million tomans should be compared with the last German estimate of §14 million and 20 million tomans for the construction'of the Aliabad-Tehran section in five years ( of my memorandum of Mav 5th last forwarded to the Foreign Office under Teliran Printed letter No. 223 of the same date, paragraph 17) or 45 -9 million tomans in all, reckoning the dollar at 18£ Krans.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 23rd January 1932. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, No. 700, DATED THE 12TH DECEMBER 1931. The difficulty regarding the form of the Telegraphs Agreement, on which I am reporting in a separate despatch, was, if the competent officials of the Persian Foreign Office are to be believed, mainly due to the fear that the Shah would have given vent to violent displeasure had he learned that the Full Powers for the signature of that Agreement which had been obtained from him had never been used. 2. Another instance of the fear which he inspires and also of the ubiquity of his activities, has occurred during the last few days. The proposals formulated in Foreign Office circular despatch No. W.-9094/7427/50 of the 2nd September 1931 for simplification of the procedure in connexion with the visit of service aeroplanes to foreign air bases, were communicated to the Persian Government. They were misunderstood both at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and at the Ministry of War, where, for reasons wffiich we have failed to discover, it was imagined that there was some connection between them and the Imperial Airways concession. The result was reply, of which a translation is enclosed, accepting the proposals of His Majesty’s Government up to the 31st March when Imperial Airways concession expires. 3. I thought that the simplest way of putting the matter right was to suggest to the officials concerned that they had perhaps been misled by some slight and quite imaginary obscurity m our original note and airange that we should sub stitute for it one which, after discussion with the Oriental Secretary, could not be misunderstood. However, when Air. Irott called on the Head of the Treaty De partment he was told that though the Departments concerned now realised that they had blundered they were not disposed to rectify their blunder forthwith as that would seem explaining matters to the Shah and that nobody dared to do. They therefore begged that we would reopen the matter in March when there would certainly be no difficulty in definitely accepting His Majesty's Government's proposals. 4. It may be that were the Minister of Court here less timorousness would have been displayed. But even were that the case, these two tn\ial episodes show that the bases of Persia’s modernisation would not resist any severe shock. 5. Looking at the bright side of tilings it may be said that the Persians under pressure of fear are beginning in individual cases to show efficiency ; they have for instance been successful in keeping from the Shah's knowledge the fact that the last number of “ Simplicissimus ” to reach this country contained a cartoon which would inevitably have provoked an explosion.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Stockholm, to the Foreign Office No. 338, DATED TEE 3GTH DECEMBER 1931. 1 have the honour to inform you that Abdul Hussein Khan Teymourtache Persian Minister of Court, accompanied by Ali Hussein Khan Daiba arrived in Stockholm on the 27th instant as the guests of the Swedish Government. 2 They were met by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and had luncheon with the King and dined with Baron Ramel yesterday. They are leaving Sweden to day. 8. Teymourtache has stated in an interview with representatives of the press that the principal object of his visit was to conclude the negotiations, which have been going on for some time, for the engagement of a Swedish general officer as adviser to the Head of the Persian General Staff. 4. Major General Gosta Lilliehook, now commanding the Stockholm garrison, is suggested as the most probable candidate for this appointment, which is to be by contract for two years. Two Swedish army electors and an aide-de-camp would accompany the general. (11 &gt; (Received on 28th February 1932 with Political Secretary's letter No. P.-76, dated 11th February 1932.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 4th February 1932. Despatch from Sir G. Clerk, His Majesty’s Ambassador, Constantinople, to the Foreign Office, No. 9, dated the 6 th January 1932. With reference to Mr. Morgan’s despatch No. 436 of the 23rd December last, 1 have the honour to report that, when I called upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning on my return from leave, his Excellency, who is here for two or three days waiting for the steamer that is to take him to Batum, began our conversation by telling me why he was going to Persia, and why he was going at this rather uncomfortable season of the year. 2. He was going now simply because, if he did not do so, he would, what with the Disarmament Conference and the visits he had to make to Moscow and Rome, e unable to go until late in the summer, whereas it was eminently desirable to settle up with the Persians as soon as possible. 3. As to why he was going at all, it was nominally, but also quite truthfully, m ®pf er reach a definite settlement of the frontier question. He had told me in November, just before I went on leave, that he would go to Tehran if by so omg he could bring these protracted frontier negotiations to an end, and since en it had become quite clear to him that this was the only way to bring this a out. The representatives ol both countries, who had been conducting the actualnegotiations, had reached agreement upon the really essential points, but they were haggling over other claims and counter-claims that did not really matter and were getting lost m the thicket of rather futile and unnecessary discussions which threatened, unless brought to an abrupt end, to envenom and upset the whole thing. Ismet Pasha had, therefore, entirely agreed with the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the only thing to do was for His Excellency to go to Tehran and settle the question on broad lines over the heads of the subordinate negotia tors. 6 4. Obviously, it was not impossible to do this without undergoing the dis comforts of a winter journey to Persia, though the fact that the Persians would be flattered by the visit would, no doubt, contribute to make the final negotiations easier, but Ismet Pasha and Dr. Tevfik Rustu were taking advantage of this ex cellent pretext in order that the latter might gauge for himself the real feeling in Tehran towards Turkey. His Excellency said that for some time he had noticed a certain reserve, or rather nervousness, in the Persian attitude towards Turkey, a nervousness which could not be entirely attributed to the rather small difficulties of the frontier negotiations, and the Turkish Government wanted to get to the bottom of this feeling and either dissipate it or adjust their policy accordingly. If it was found that Persia’s uneasiness simply arose from failure to grasp the sincerity of Turkish policy, the Turkish Government felt that the best way to set the Persian minds at ease was by personal contact between the Turkish Foreign Minister and His Majesty the Shah and his responsible advisers, including parti cularly Teymourtache. The Turkish Government wanted Persia to understand that Turkey’s desire for friendship was loyal and sincere, but if Tevfik Rustu Bey found that the Persians failed to respond to the spirit of his visit, then Turkey would draw the natural inference and take all necessary precautions against what the Minister for Foreign Affairs called “ a Persian stab in the back.” 5. His Excellency said that it was only to me that he had given these ex planations, because he realised how closely interested we were in Persia, and he wished us to know exactly the motives for his visit. 6. I should add that Tevfik Rustu Bey proposes to proceed from Tehran to Bagdad to visit King Feisal and, presumably, put the finishing touches to the discussions which Nuri Pasha has been having with his Excellency in Angora. 7. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran. ( 12 ) {Received on 28th February 1932 with Political Secretary's letter No. P.-76, dated Uth February 1932.)

In the course of our conversation this afternoon, Ferit Bey referred to the readjustment of boundaries between Turkey and Persia, about which he spoke to me the other day. The treaty for the exchange of territory was signed at Tehran on the 23rd instant, and, as a result, when it was ratified, the whole of Mount Ararat would be within the boundaries of Turkey, while, by way of compensation, a corresponding area further south would be transferred to the Persian side of the line.

Despatch from Mr. Hoare, His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Sir John Simon, Foreign Office, No. 734, dated the 30th December 1931 . I have the honour to report, in continuation of the information transmitted under cover of my despatch No. 719 of the 16th instant, that several statements evidently of an official character, have been published in various Persian news papers explaining the antecedents of the late Jewish Deputy, Haim, and giving reasons for his execution. 2. The most detailed statement appeared in the newspaper “ Shafagh-i- Surkh ” of the 17th December. It was first mentioned that Haim was employed in the intelligence service of the British troops who occupied the north of Persia in 1918-20, and in that capacity performed many functions inimical to national interests. The next charge against Haim was that he w as instrumental in causing, by false promises, a number of unfortunate Jew^s to leave their beloved fatherland of Persia and suffer untold agonies as emigrants to Palestine. Then, being en raged at failure to secure re-election to the Majlis in its sixth term, he took part in a revolutionary plot against the present regime. One of his fellow-conspirators (Colonel Fooladin) was shot and the others imprisoned when the plot w as discovered. The examination of Haim was only concluded a few^ days previously ; the Military Court, after having considered the accused man’s baseless defence, agreed to the military public prosecutor s demands for a capital sentence, and the execution took place. 3. This official statement is, no doubt, the last word of the Persian Govern ment in the matter. It shows plainly that Haim was examined, if at all, only be!ore a secret military court, which had no jurisdiction over him, a civilian; that no definite evidence was produced against him (for, if it had, the official statement w r ould surely have said what it was) ; and that, in fact, Haim was sudr denly executed without a regular trial. I am informed that another of the Per sians who w r ere imprisoned in 1926 under a charge of treason, named Major Ruhuliah Khan, is now at liberty and maintains that the whole accusation of treason was a complete fabrication. I have no information concerning the story of Kaim’s (Haims) employment with the British forces at the end of the war. As for the execution oi Colonel Fooladin, in 1926, I am informed that when the death warrant was prepared for signature, the then chief of staff, General Shaibani, refused to sign it, though strongly pressed to do so by His Majesty the Shah, wffio finally signed it himself.

With reference to my despatch No. 338 of the 30th of December 1931 [Serial No. (10)] I have the honour to report that Captain Alis Nordquist, technical expert to the Military Bureau of the Air Administration, has been engaged for six months as adviser to the Persian Air Force. He left for Persia a few days ago.(15) (Received on 13th March 1932, with Political Secretary's letter No P-8 dated 19th February 1932.) P.Z. 1060/1932. Despatch from Sir E. Ovey, His Majesty s Ambassador at Moscow, to Sir John Simon, Foreign Office, No. 29, dated the 19th January 1932. I have the honour to report that his Highness Teymourtache, the Persian Minister of Oourt, arrived m Moscow on the 14th January. He was received at the railway station with unusual ceremony—the Commissar for Foreign Affairs M. Litvinov, the Vice-Commissar for Foreign Affairs, M. Karakhan, and a number of other officials of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs being present I understand that a mounted guard of honour of creditable smartness was also in attendance. The Swedish and Norwegian Ministers also attended in their capacity as representatives of their countries in Persia. 2. In the course of the day his Excellency called upon the president of the Central Executive Committee of the Tsik, M. Kalinin, and was afterwards received by the chairman o: the Council of People’s Commissars, Molotov. In the evening a dinner party was given in his honour by the People’s Commissar for ForeigiT Affairs to which heads of missions were invited. Cordial speeches of the usual diplomatic type, afterwards published in the press, were made bv M. Litvinov and Teymourtache. 3. M. Litvinov began by declaring that he was proud of the fact that the October revolution had opened a new era in the relations between Persia and the L. S. S. P. These relations were now being developed on a basis of complete equali ty and mutual respect for the sovereignty of either country. A beginning had been made with the declaration of the annulment of concessions and loans of the Tsarist Government in Persia. In 1921, the Soviet Government had concluded with Persia a treaty of friendship the friendly policy of the Soviet Government receiving further expression in the form of a pact or guarantee of neutrality in 1927 and in the commercial treaty of 1931. The development of the Soviet Union would, at the same time, assist in widening the scope of economic relations between the two countries. M. Litvinov said he was convinced that the friendly policy of the Soviet Government in its relations to Persia was an expression of the peaceful policy of the Soviet Union, and in particular with regard to her immediate neighbours. M. Litvinov concluded by raising his glass to the health of the head of the Persian Government, to his Highness Teymourtache, and to the prosperity of the Persian nation. 4. In his reply Teymourtache stated that he was pleased to find himself once more in Moscow amongst representatives of a nation which was friendly to Persia, and to avail himself of the occasion to express his deep thanks for the hospitable reception he had received. He recalled with pleasure the occasion when he came for the first time to Moscow to carry on the negotiations which terminated with the signature of the agreement of 1927. Turning to Soviet-Persian relations, he elluded to the fact that the October revolution had completely changed the character of the relations between the two countries, a circumstance which was aiding the national development and political rebirth of his country. “ The aim,” he said, “ of present-day Persia is a simple one: desire to live freely on our native soil and under our native sun and to work for the good of our country”. Persia was working for her political, economic and administrative reorganisation and had no time or w sh to enter into academic combinations or groupings in inter national politics. The Persians desired support while organising their country, and they knew that they would always receive such support from the Soviet Union, He sa;d that he was sure that Persia would therefore never figure in any political combination directed against the Soviet Union. Teymourtache concluded by drinking a toast to Persian-Soviet friendship, and to the prosperity of the Soviet Union and members of the Soviet Government. 5. M. Litvinov apparently spoke extempore or from memory, while the Minis ter of Court, who was educated in Russia, read his in Russian from a written script. The most remarkable feature to the listeners was that he included in his16 toast the health of Stalin, a reference which was omitted in the published te t and was admitted by a Russian to be “ Plutot amical que protocolaire ” I addition do the above.festivities, a luncheon was offered by Molotov, the “ Minister ” of Russia, and a similar Russo-Persian lunch was held on the followin 6 day at the Persian Embassy. ® 6. After the conclusion of the dinner given by M. Litvinov a reception was held, to which were invited other members of the deplomatic Corps and members of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, together with a few members of the People’s Commissariat for War. On the following day a race meetino consisting of trotting and flat races on the snow, was held at 5 o’clock in the afternoon in honour of Teymourtache. The weather was warm and no particular hardship was involved (as would usually have been the case at this time of the year) in witnessing this spectacle. In the evening Teymourtache attended the first portion of a performance of Rimski Korsakov’s “ Coq d’Or,” returning afterwards to the Persian Embassy, where a reception was held for heads of missions and members of the Diplomatic Corps, members of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs being invited as on the previous evening. On the 17th instant Teymourtache visited the Amo motor factory and the aeroplane factory “ Aviozavod ”. 7. Teymourtache was reported to be leaving Moscow on Monday the 18th instant, but is apparently still here. The Russian Government went to consider able lengths to show their desire to underline their friendly sentiments to Persia. Few Russians were invited to the reception attended by the Diplomatic Corps, but Teymourtache divided his time at the race meeting between the diplomatic box and that containing persons—none of them apparently very prominent—represent ative of the Government, and he had ample opportunity for discussing Persian- Soviet politics at the entertainments to which the Diplomatic Corps were not invited. M. Litvinov described Teymourtache to me before his visit as a man of exceptional capacity and the veritable ruler of Persia. I understand that he still adheres to this view. ( 16 ) {Received on 13th March 1932, with Political Secretary's letter No. P.-8, dated February 1932.) P.Z.1111/1932. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, No. 5, DATED THE 5TH JANUARY 1932. I have the honour to bring the following incident to your knowledge. 2. A Mr. Lawrence Fayrer Arnold Edgell, a clerk in Holy Orders and School master attached to the Church Missionary Society at Isfahan, recently left Isfahan to travel via Tehran and the Soviet Union to England. 3. His passport was sent by his host at Tehran, the Secretary and Treasurer of the American Presbyterian Mission to the Passport and Visa Section of the Tehran Central Police on the 13th December at 9-30 a.m. with a request for an exit visa. 4. A message was conveyed by the Police to Mr. Edgell to attend in person. He was then put through a searching enquiry as to his antecedents, perofession, and general raison d'etre, and it was not until 7-30 p.m. on the 15th December, that is, fifty-eight hours later, that the exit visa was accorded him, and then only after re presentations by His Majesty’s Consul to the Police Department and finally by the Acting Oriental Secretary to the Chief of Police himself. The excuse given by the Police Department concerned was that the Chief of Police, who has reserved to him self the sole authority to sign exit visas could not be found. 5. There is, however, little difficulty, both from the tenour of the questions put to Mr. Edgell and from the unusual and unnecessary delay incurred, in appre ciating that Mr. Lawrence Edgell’s Christian name was the cause of the trouble, and that fears had been aroused that Colonel Lawrence was abroad once again.ESDB 17 (17) Received fkom His Majesty s Legation, 1 ehran, with their endorsement No. 42, dated the 3rd March 1932. (Copy sent to the F. 0. under P. L. No. Ill, dated the 3rd March 1932.) Summary of Events and Conditions in Ears daring the year 1931. This period passed unusually quietly. The tribes, even if not all perhaps sub dued in spirit, lacked leaders and also ammunition and the means of buying or other wise obtaining it. There were no serious disturbances and the central government continued to increase its hold on the province. However, though the number of troops was decreased and though the post of Governor General was once again given to a civilian, the mam administrative power outside the principal towns remained with the army, which had not been relegated to its more normal function of merely ' supporting civil authority. 2. In February the Amir Lashkar, Habibullah Khan Shaibani, left for Tehran, being relieved as Governor General by Muzaffar ATam, who also continued his previous work as Governor of Bushire'and the Gulf Ports. Muzaffar A’lam held the two positions for five months and earned respect by his hard work. Regarding the reason given for his departure there were a number of rumours, of which the most likely would seem to have been concerning certain disputes with the military. Farajullah Khan Bohrami, who had been Governor General at Isfahan, for a year, was transferred to Fars in the same capacity in August. He is also a man of industry but the very great part of his work is connected with strictly local matters such as municipal administration while the control of outlying districts and of the tribes has, as has been already stated, remained largely with the military. After two years of an entirely military regime, the resumption of civil power cannot in this country be other than gradual. Farajullah Khan however holds what is still an important position and he is understood to have the ear of the Shah, having pre viously worked for some time in close touch with His Majesty. 3. Amir Lashkar Habibullah Khan during the previous year had directed con- siderable operations in difficult country against the Mamassani and the Boir Ahmedi tribes ; he had not been altogether successful and he made mistakes, but he had in creased the security of the province and the prestige of his command. Ten months after leaving Shiraz he was, presumably owing the blunders made and jealousies aroused here, deprived of all military rank and imprisoned. The command of the mixed Fars brigade passed to Sarhang Ibrahim Khan Zandieh, a young officer appointed from Tehran. The brigade was much reduced in numbers during the year for, as no serious operations were undertaken here, two regiments were moved elsewhere before the summer. A small force was sent from Shiraz in the autumn to Dashti, now outside the province of Fars, to assist in the disarming of that neighbourhood. 4. From the tribes many of the leaders were called to Tehran where they will probably have to stay for long, against their wills and often in actual want, under the eye of their royal master. Registration, a necessary preliminary to conscription, was not started nor were further steps taken about enforcing dress regulations out side the towns. Disarming was carried out by a number of commissions without great trouble but with questionable success. Military officers were placed in charge of all the leading groups. Threats to stop all migration were not carried out. The connection with the Qashqais of the family of Ismail Khan, Soulat-ud- Doulah, was very much weakened. He himself was on friendly terms with Amir Lashkar Shaibani and early in the year assisted in the collection of arms from his tribe but in April he was ordered to Tehran and later on practically all his family and also many of the kalantars of the Qashqais had to follow him there. His son was relieved of the post of Il-Khani and a military officer, Sarhang Shakir Khan Tabatabai, was appointed in his place but only joined the tribes at the end of the year. The Boir Ahmedi and Mamassani districts were occupied by military posts and these tribes w T ere increasingly divided up into small sections. Sartip Khan w r ent to moused18 Tehran, and Mir Ghulam, the last of the important insurgent chiefs of the Boir Ahmedi was killed in the early summer during a private quarrel. Others of the rebels of the previous year were caught and executed at Shiraz and Behbehan These tribes are particularly intractable and can no doubt produce other leaders and still possess arms but Sarhang Jehanbani, who w^as mainly responsible for their area, had no serious risings to quell. £ From the Khamseh tribes little of importance was heard. The Qawam did not visit Fars at all during 1931 but, from the fact that some of the more influential of his former lieutenants were sent for at the end of the year, it is surmised that he is involved in certain of the accusations and counter claims voiced in the capital about past troubles here. 5. Security was certainly better and various brigands were brought to book, notably one Mehdi Surkhi, who had for long given trouble in the Fasa district and other parts ; he was hanged in Shiraz in May. Another band was broken up at Mazijun near Lar in March. Only one serious robbery was reported on the main Bushire road and this occurred in July when a car was held up near Khush-Ali and all the passengers, including an official of the Financial Department, were robbed and stripped. Few robberies were heard of in the latter part of the year either in Shiraz or on the main roads, where Amnieh posts are still numerous ; on the 35 miles of main road between Shiraz and Persipolis for example there are five posts. On the less frequented roads complete safety cannot be relied on for some time to come. 6. Municipal and social services in Shiraz progressed. The electric lighting of the streets was started at the beginning of the year and the British engines worked well; probably no other town in the country has such an efficient electric supply. The new wide main streets were well kept and work on others was commenced. The completed roads are often lined with empty shops and some of the wounds caused by demolitions for these roads were still gaping but the work was planned with care and none of the interesting old buildings were damaged. None of them on the other hand were repaired and the only work of restoration in the neighbour hood—that at Persipolis—has been undertaken by Germans with American money and does not appear to have aroused much interest among the Persians. An Italian subject works as engineer of the Municipality. There were no serious epidemics. Apart from the Church Missionary Society's hospital, which is to be replaced by a larger building now under construction, there is no proper civil hospital, the military having acquired the two buildings given by Persians in the past for use as hospitals. A new and comparatively enlightened Director of Public Health was appointed in the summer. Education remained in charge of Mirza Abul Qasim Khan Fuziiyat and the Persian schools are using less antiquated methods even if their teaching is still super ficial. The Church Missionary Society’s school for girls was well attended by the children of leading Persians but considerable interference from unintelligent ins pectors had to be borne. English is widely spoken in Shiraz owing to commercial connection with the British Empire ; even at the National Bank here English is, after Persian, the most used language. Two clean looking hotels were opened and also a fine new cinema. The back wardness, though perhaps not the lack of senses, of Shiraz is somewffiat shown by the fact that men and women are not yet allowed to attend the cinemas at the same time; in other places in Persia the sexes are no longer separated in this way. 7. Outside the main towns the only representatives of a beneficent govern ment who come into close touch with the people are the tax collectors and the mili tary. The conditions of life in the villages have hardly changed for the better. Ih e improvements to the main roads only affect them in that their animals are often, in more senses than one, driven off the main routes by motor transport. &gt; The road to Bushire was worked on and considerable widening was completed on a number of parts of the narrow passes. Work was continued to make the roa from Kazerun to Khuzistan practicable for motors.In connection with communications outside the towns mention must be made of the departure in March of the officials of the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment, whose predecessors did much to make movement in the province possible iti former days. As the lines and other equipment of the Department were handed over to the Persian authorities in good order, deterioration was not really marked by the end of the year. One result of the departure of these officials is that reliable information with regard to happenings in the province is much harder to obtain than used to be the case. 8. If the old menace of internal insecurity has been largelyovercome and if some conditions of life in the towns have been improved, the province is now in the throes of a severe struggle in its economic situation. The province of Ears has for many years much depended on the opium trade, from which all classes derived profit. Owing to legislation, rather than to other conditions such as world markets, the price of this drug has fallen greatly and a very large part of the year’s crop remained unsold, even at its cheap price, in the govern ment monopoly stores ; it is likely to stay there for a long while. The rainfall during the winter of 1930-31 was small but this shortage will, according to local opinion, affect the crops of 1932 more than those of the period under review, which actually were up to average. There was very little outside demand for grain so bread remained cheap. Very extreme poverty was however widespread and the tribes people and villagers no longer came to Shiraz with the good money to spend on which the town must largely exist. Tea and sugar became so expensive that many had to do wit lout their favourite drink and there was not enough money to buy the dearer materials to replace pitiful rags. Merchants struggled to find a way to work in with the complicated regulations which had done much to paralyse local trade before the severity of the world crisis was felt. Of the money circulating in the form of paper at a month or two’s date much had very little real money behind it. For the redress of wrongs the townspeople and villagers could not rely on the Courts, of which the reputation was not good, and depression and pessimism were general. They have nevertheless extreme patience and surprising vatality and have had to carry on before under circumstances quite as bad. (ltd.) C, H. S.

Despatch from Mr. Hoare, His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Sir John Simon, Foreign Office, No. 46, dated the 27th January 1932. With reference to Mr. Morgan’s despatch No. 436 of the 23rd December last, I have the honour to report that Tevfik Riistii Bey, Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, accompanied by the Turkish Ambassador and the following staff His Excellency Djelal Bey (Deputy for Smyrna and Director-General of the “ Banque d’Affaires former Minister), Hussein Vasfi Bey (Director-General in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs), Colonel Chiikru Ali Bey (General Staff), Idris Tchora Bey (Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Consul), former Osman Nuri Bey (Secretary in the “ Banque d’Affairs”), arrived at Pahlavi on the 17th January and reached the capital on the 18th January by road, the Persian authorities having performed a really remarkable pieceoi wor in clearing of a heavy snow-fall the difficult passes between here and the Caspian. Three days (one of them an eighteen-hour day) of intensive work ioUowed, as Tevfik Riistu Bey wished to leave for Bagdad on the 25th January, and y ie January it was possible to issue a communique, of which a copy is enclosed, stating that agreement had been reached on the subject of the frontier m t e neig our oo of Little Ararat, and that it had been decided to conclude a treaty of arbitration and to initiate discussions for the conclusion of establishment, commercial a extradition conventions, as well as for the development of economic re a ions. 2. From both Tevfik Riistii Bey (who greeted me as a long-lost twin) and Feroughi I have formed the definite impression that the visit is regarded great success, having cleared aivay an atmosphere of | ll spicion '' IK ''i . j r horn relic of the past more than anything else. Tevfik Rustu Bey declared that the Persians were genuinely surprised at the goodwill an csire . . , which he had show, but which had from the time o the Mosul the keynote of Turkey’s foreign policy ; as I knew well, is genera i m uq er entiv which had received the steady support of the Ghazi, a e J e „ Vr j satisfactory settlement was infinitely preferable to no se , ' promise and believed that he had taught the Persians a lesson in issues between which would be useful in promoting a settlement of t e ou s^ g - ^ Persia and His Majesty’s Government. His Excellency further toW^ nothing could have been more cordial than the i hah s manner • coun try* clearly had a sound grasp of the main political issues which confronted his country 3. At one of the parties given in his honour, Tevfik Rustu told me^th^ be, had just received a piece of news wLich delighted im, a^ . month of May. namely, that you hoped to pay a visit to Angora m the co ^ f ^ Jnfa coS Having shared his delight, I said something joking ) a 1 _ ^ f a nv blast t'o the Litvinov visit, which led him to misunderstanding with Moscow ; m fact, so fai _ I . t soun( Jly he was perfectly sure that both in l j0ndo ' ( 'Treplied that I was sure that in their beds (“ dormaient sur les deux oreilles ). ^ • j did in they did m London, but was Ws Excellency absolutely ^ Mogcow was perlmps hypIr sensdTve Td inclined to be suspicious ^ a )‘ ^^‘^Xbght'of vided that care was taken to strangle suspic.ons even before they saw day. , 4.

(Received on 9th April 1932, with Political Secretary's letter No. P.-12, dated the 24th March 1932.) Enclosure in Department of Overseas Trade covering letter. No. 25838/32, dated the 15th March 1932. Memorandum. The Department of Overseas Trade transmit, herewith, copy of a despatch No. 3, Overseas Trade, of February 2nd, from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed, relative to a suspicious fire which broke out in the building of a certain. Nasirbeg off in Pahlevi Avenue at Meshed. These premisses had been leased to the Sharq Company, As the Foreign Office are, of course aware, the Sharq Com pany has been the vehicle for Soviet trade in Persia, until recently, although its activities are now being taken over by a new Soviet Government Department called Vosgostorg. 2. As requested by Consul General Barrett, the gist of his despatch was com' municated verbally and in confidence to a Mr. Fridaye and his partner, who were acting for a syndicate of Lloyds’ underwriters. Mr. Fridaye was, however, not content with receiving the information verbally and has requested either that the sense of this despatch should be communicated to him in writing, or, alternatively, that he should be permitted to bring a shorthand writer to the offices of the Department to take down verbally the salient points of the matter. 3. Mr. Fridaye was thereupon informed that it was not possible to accede to this request without obtaining the sanction of higher authority, and the views of the Foreign Office are therefore sought to know what reply should be made to Mr. Fridaye upon this point. It appears to the Department of Overseas Trade that the two main objections to giving Mr. Fridaye a document in wTiting are :— (a) That such a document might subsequently involve His Majesty's Consul- General in legal proceedings ; and (b) That such legal proceedings might reflect upon the hcna fdts of the Soviet Government or their agents. In this connection it is perhaps w^orth recalling that His Majesty’s Ambassador at Moscow, in a despatch No. 99 of 22nd February 1932, reported upon an exten sive fire in the offices of the State Planning Commission at Moscow, but ascribed it merely to the fact that the stores therein were kept at great heat during the winter and that the flues are not properly swept until late in spring. 4. Point (6) is entirely political. With regard to point (a), the Department of Oversees Trade can trace no definite references in the Consular Instructions to the Principles which govern the participation of Consular Officers in legal proceed ings, but they transmit, herewith copy of manuscript minutes on Department of Overseas Trade paper 15339/FE., written by the Library of the Foreign Office and the head of the Consular Department on April 6th, 1925, summarising the precedents available in such matters. 5. From these minutes it w^ould appear that speaking generally it is undesir able that Consular Officers should become involved in legal cases, and it is therefore possible that the Foreign Office may desire to instruct the Department of Overseas Trade to inform Mr. Fridaye that his proper course is to obtain the services of the nearest Lloyds’ agent, and that the services of His Majesty’s Consul-General can only be involved in the matter to the extent of legalising any evidence which may be obtained by Lloyds’ agent..6. A copy of this memorandum has been sent to the India Office, for informa tion. CECIL C. FARREE. Department of Overseas Trade, 35, Old Queen Street, Tiondon, S. W. L 15th March, 1932. CB.-15339/FE. Copy of Minutes. The objection to a British Consular Officer giving evidence either by appearing in court or by other means has only found expression in the past in cases in which the evidence to be given was objectionable to His Majesty’s Government, or it was not absolutely necessary for the officer to be mixed up with the dispute in question. There has been no recorded objecticn in cases where the evidence to be furnished was unobjectionable and in which it was necessary in the interests of justice that the evidence should be given. When possible, however, actual appearance in court has been avoided. While the cases in which a Consular Officer has been requested to furnish evi dence in matters connected with the his official duties have been numerous, only one case can be traced of an officer volunteering evidence in a matter not strictly within the official sphere. In this case Consul Abbott was asked by a British firm in Sao Faulo to give evidence against a man previously employed by him who was suing the firm for WTongful dismissal. Permission was given. The evidence was taken, however, on commission in London, Mr. Abbott being on leave at the time. The case under consideration (z.e., in 1925) differs from all preceding cases, including that outlined above. The evidence in Mr. Hoy land s case is required m support of a British firm, and the Consul is willing to furnish it. Judging, however, from the brief information supplied, it consists of a testimony which might equally will be furnished by a non-official expert. (Signed) R. 0. CON. April 6th 1925. As you will see from the above there are no cut and dried rules, but it is always better if Consular Officers can keep out of legal cases. (Signed) E. GYE, April 6th, 1925. Enclosure in Serial No. (22). Confidential Despatch from His Majesty s Consul-General, Meshed (Persia), to the Department of Overseas Irade, London, 0.1. o. , dated the 2nd February 1932. I have the honour to enclose a copy of a communication dated 3rd December that I received from Mr. Eric P. Fridaye of 133 Moorgate and of the reply I sent to him through the Foreign Office. 2. So far as I have been able to ascertain a fire broke out on the top floor of NasirbegofFs building in Pahlevi avenue which had been leased to the oharq Com pany, a Russian concern. Baniloff the head of the Shaiq who 18 sa ^ 0 e a P ai 1 eularly blackguardly G. P. U. agent had been to Asbkabad and had there, ascertained that three auditors would shortly be visiting Meshed. On the 24th November ths Bolsheviks sent their families to new premises and at 10 p.m. the Nasirbegofi s premises were closed for the night none remaining on the top floor, excep one boy. The fire was noted between midnight and 1 a.m. and was eventually extin guished about 7 a.M: by the Military and Police. MC148FD26 3. Tt is said that the Bolsheviks had removed practically all their furniture including a piano before the fire occurred, but that they had omitted to take away their documents. When the fire was burning they made an attempt to recover the papers which were in a safe in the burning room, but their efforts were unavail ing. # 4. These are the grounds for suspecting that the fire was not accidental. The official view as given to me by the Governor General is that the fire was caused by a Russian stove. When the house was built there were no special heating arrange ments. The Russians on taking possession insisted on Russian stoves, so five of these were built into the walls. The upper storey of the building was of the usual anti-earthquake construction, i.e., a lettice work of wood beams filled in with sun dried bricks. The pipe leading from the Russian stoves had of necessity to be very close to wooden beajns which took fire when the pipe got red hot. 5. Estimates of damage made by the Military, Police and Municipality are Tomans 6,500, 8,000 and 8,500 but I have heard through the Governor General that Nasirbegofi is likely to claim 30,000 Tomans. His Excellency however added that Tomans 17,000 should cover all costs. Nasirbegoff alleges that the fire and the water psed in extinguishing it caused damage to the lower storey ; that he will have to rebuild considerably from the foundation and that valuable electric fittings, walnut doors and other accessories were destroyed or damaged, 6. To watch the interests of a British Insurance Firm without being given any authority, except a letter from an Insurance Broker, is a very difficult matter, the more so as the local partners in the firm are very uncommunicative and have given out that they still do not know whether the building was insured or not. 7. No attempt has yet been made to rebuild the second floor, which was des troyed, though the ground floor, which is let as a series of shops, is again in full occupation. 8. I have to request that you will communicate as much of this information as you think fit either to Mr. Fridaye or to Lloyds. 9. I hear fiom His Majesty’s Commercial Secretary at Tehran that this is not the first occasion on which Soviet Russians have been suspected of setting fire to to their office papers, and I venture to submit for your consideration the desir ability of British Insurance Firms including a special clause in their policies to protect themselves from the risk of fire that seems to be involved when a building i s leased to Soviet Russians, 10. I have sent a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Corumercial Secretary, Tehran. Sub-Enclosure, , Letter from Messrs. Eric P. Frtdaye, Insurance Brokers 133, Moorgate, London, E.

I have been asked by a Syndicate of Lloyds Underwriters to communicate with you in connection with a fire which is stated to have occurred on the top floor of a building owned by Messrs. Nasirbegoft Brothers, Pahlevi Street, Meshed, and to request you to be kind enough to protect their interests and furnish a Report and Estimate for the amount of repairs. If you will be kind enough to atter d to this matter with the least possible delay and let me hear from you together with all expenses that you incur, I shall, feel grateful. Letter from His Majesty’s Consul-General Meshed (Persia), to Mr. Er 10 P. Fridaye, Insurance Brokers, 133, Moorgate, London, E. C.-2, No. 1427/374/2, dated the 31st December 1931. I am in receipt of your letter of 3rd December and I will do what I can in the matter. The only repairs that have been taken in hand so far are those which were necessary to render the lower floor fit for re-occupation as shops.(23) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, No. 159, dated the 2,}rd March 1952. (Copy received under endorsement No. 70.) • I have the honour to inform you that on March 17th the Mejlis passed, unani mously and without discussion, a bill authorising the Ministry of Finance'to pay from the Government resei \ e a sum not exceeding one million, five hundred thou* sand pounds (£1,500,000) “to complete the preparation of military munitions,” over and above the six million Tomans (Ts. 6,000.000) earmarked in the budget of 1308 (1930/31) for the same purpose. The Mejlis also agreed that this sum of six million Tomans (Ts. 6,000,000) shoxAdhz considered presumably with an eye to the unexpended balance—as the equivalent of one million, two hundred thousand pounds, (£1,200,000). This should put close on two million pounds (£2,000,000) at the disposal of the Persian Ministry of W ar for the purchase of new armaments as well as of new plant for the manufacture of explosives and ammunition. A copy of the bill is enclosed. 2. Shortly after the introduction of the Foreign Trade Monopoly Law it seemed likely that as a result of the large stocks of imported goods within the country at the time, and the grossly exaggerated figures for exports published by the Persian Cus toms, the Minister of Court would be in a position to assert at the end of the first year of the working of the law that he had succeeded in balancing the international payments of the country without making use of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company royalty; the latter would then become available for purchase of armaments, to the intense satisfaction of the Shah, as soon as the gold reserve had been completed. But now that this reserve is no longer required for currency purposes, there are not only the future royalties to be disposed of but also those that have remained unex pended in recent years. The total sum available is now probably not far short of five million pounds (£5,000,000). 3. The process of spending would appear to have begun. It remains to be seen whether the Shah will really try to raise and equip an army of seventy-two thousand (72,000) the number quoted by the Persian Pepresentative at the Disarmament Conference—but recent frontier troubles and the arrests reported in my Despatch No. 128 of the 9th March 1932 [Serial No. (29)], will probably strengthen him in his conviction that he must increase the forces at his disposal and ensure that these forces (and particularly the Air Force) are better fed, clothed and equipped. 4. As regards the purchase of war material, the movements of Major Arfa, a trusted officer who deals direct with the Shah, are of interest. The first special grant to the Army of six million Tomans (Ts. 6,000,000) was largely expended on the purchase of material from the Skoha Arsenal at Brunn, and Major Arfa was entrusted with the actual placing of this order. Last November he returned to Tehran and almost immediately left again for Europe, probably to obtain further quota tions and information. In February of this year, Major Arfa paid another short visit to Tehran, presumably with the object of receiving orders from the Shah. He is now back in Europe and it is understood that he is particularly interested in air craft and artillery. Motor transport is also required by the army and heavy expen diture is anticipated in connection with barrack construction throughout Persia. 5. I have already dealt with the bearing of this seemingly reckless expenditure on the question of the debt owing to His Majesty’s Government (see my Despatch No. 146 of the 18th March) and reported that, &gt;vhen I raised this subject, ley- ttiourtache asserted that he considered the contemplated expenditure on armaments to be absolutely essential. It may be that he considers it essential, not so much to the well being of the country as to the maintenance of his own position, since a call for economy in this more than in any other branch of national expenditure ^ould imply that the trade monopoly had failed, a conclusion His Highness cannot yet bring himself to admit, least of all to the Shah. 6.

It is likewise being sanctioned that the Tomans 6,000,000 should be taken as the equivalent of £1,200,000 which should be drawn in foreign exchange from the reserve funds of the country and that the period of its being debited in the accounts should not be limited to the financial year and the period of action of 1308.

(Copy received under endorsement No. 74.) I have the honour to inform you that Mr. Chaker, the representative of the International Sleeping Car Company in Cairo, has recently been visiting Tehran and has made arrangements for the establishment of a through service by road and rail between Tehran and Nisibin. 2. I enclose a copy of a notice (not printed) issued by Mr. Chaker, from which it will be seen that the journey between Tehran and Khaniqin is to be accomplished in tw r o days and the journey between Tehran and London in nine and a half days. The accomplishment of the journey between Tehran and Kermanshah in a single stage sounds a formidable undertaking, but Mr. Chaker assures me that it can be d^ne with ease and comfort. He does not intend to book more than three pas sengers in any one car, except in the case of families. 3. Full details of fares have not yet been issued, but I understand that a first class ticket from Tehran to London will cost eighty pounds (£80) including sleeping car accommodation and meals on the trains. The fare from Khaniqin to Tehran will be ten pounds (gold), £10 (gold) and from Tehran to Khaniqin six pounds (gold), £j 6 (gold). Luggage will be six pence (6d.) per kilogramme, without any free allowance and the cost of food and lodging on the journey will be between ten shillings (10s.) and fifteen shillings (15s.). Making all allowances for luggag e &gt; food and lodging and the cost of the railway journey from Khaniqin to Baghdad, e new service appears to be distinctly cheaper than the defunct Junkers air service, which charged United States dollars seventy-five (U.S.£75) fora place between Tehran and Baghdad. 4. It will be noted that the ne/w service will not be maintained during August and December, January and February. The motor-cars will, neverth 3 4 5 6 ^ be available for hire during these months, at a cost of eighteen pounds (£18) iot journey between Tehran and Khaniqin [thirty-six pounds (£36) for the round npj- 5. Mr. Chaker informs me that he has had to abandon, for the present ^ rate, a scheme which his company had in mind for the establishment of nrs ' c hotels in Tehran and along the route, mainly on account of the obstacles m theof the possession of real property by foreign companies. The company will no doubt use their influence to improve the standard of the existing hotels, a point which is of importance in view of the fact that the main object of the company is to increase their earnings on the railways in Europe and Asia Minor by rendering if; easier for tourists and others to visit Persia. For this reason, the fares between Tehran and Nisibin have been fixed on a cost basis without any expectation of making a profit. The company (and certain railway administrations in Europe who have joined them in the venture) are in fact prepared to lose eight hundred pounds (£800) a year at the outset. 6. Mr. Chaker also informs me that the Persian authorities, though they have not been actively obstructive, have been somewhat half-hearted in their support, mainly, he believes, for fear of upsetting the Soviet Government. It is interesting to note that the latter have responded to the announcement of the new service by providing sleeping cars on the route from Baku to Shepetovka, which they have not troubled to do hitherto. Mr.-Chaker has incidentally told the Persian Government that he cannot, as the Soviet authorities do, give a special rebate to Persian officials, his prices being already at rock bottom. 7. The new service should gain an unexpected advantage at the start from the disappearance of Junkers, which cannot have been forseen when Mr. Chaker first arrived. 8.

Enclosure in Serial No. (25). Minutes by the Commercial Secre'ary on the position of the National Bank. Mr. Wilkinson told me last night that a commisssion had been appointed under the presidency of the Minister of Justice to examine the books of the National Bank, the attention of the Government having been recently drawn n the heavy undisclosed losses which the bank has been experiencing of late. e matter is being kept very secret. I have stressed in recent reports to the Department of Overseas Trade, in connexion with the impartiality which Dr. Lindenblatt alleges he is animated in the matter of orders for textile machinery, the parlous situation in which the National Bank is said to find itself. I have also obtained confirmation o &lt;6 report that the Shah intends to replace Dr. Lindenblatt by Reza Quli Khan, the latter’s No. 2 in the Pahlavi Bank having recently approached me through an intermediary, to enquire how the Legation would view his appom men as assistant to Reza Quli Khan in the National Bank as soon as his chief returns from his banking course in Europe. This man, Kulak y uameris a e Russian, who was manager of the Russian Bank m Tehran un i ' J • When he refused to return to Moscow and was consequently sacked ^ gets on extremely well with him, but does not think \er) muc o im as ker. MC148FD30 I let Kulak know that as long as he co-operated with the Imperial Bank— which he gave me to understaifl would be his earnest endeavour-1 personally, saw no objection to his appointment and that I should certainly rather see him there than a German. _ , The days of the German banking regime seem to be counted, lliere can be no doubt that this has been hastened by the recent press campaign ‘ de part et d’autre ” the political bias against the Germans having certainly led various denunciators, who might otherwise have kept quiet, to voice their several objec tions to Dr. Lindenblatt and his methods. February 10, 1932. The Tehran press now states that the National Bank have been instructed to hand over the Kerej and Kahrizak sugar factories to the Department of Industries, which is a serious blow to the bank’s prestige.^ It seems that the Shah was in furiated by the bill which Dr. Lindenblatt put in for up-to-date expenses in con nexion with the construction and equipment of these two factories amounting to 500 000 tomans, but doubly so when the bill was withdrawn on the plea that there had been a mistake and a new one for 600,000 tomans substituted. According to another reliable, but hitherto unconfirmed, report the Depart ment of Industry is also to take over the management of the Ahabad, \ezd and Kerman spinning mills from the National Bank.

Despatch from Mr. Hoare His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Sir John Simon, Foreign Office, No. 128, dated the 9th March 1932. I have the honour to report that the police authorities of Tehran have recently arrested a number of Persians, apparantly on suspicion of being concerned in a plot of a revolutionary nature. Ever since the arrival of the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs in Tehran last January, I have received reports of arrests made and heard many rumours as to their true cause. Shortly before the arrival of Tevfik Rustu Bey, indeed, I observed that the police officers stationed in the streets of Tehran were armed with rifles; enquiries elicited the unconvincing explanation. that they were issued in order to show extra respect to the important visitor. 2. I believe that about forty persons in all are under arrest. A good many of them are minor employees of various Ministeries, such as the Mimstery of Posts and Telegraphs, of National Economics, of Justice, and of Foreign Affairs. A few Armenians are also among those arrested ; a fact which no doubt gave rise to the least plausible of the many stories circulating in explanation; namely, that the cause of the arrests was a plot by Armenians to murder Tevfik Bustu Bey. One of the secretaries of the Prime Minister has also been arrested. 3. Another rumour explains the arrests as being due to the discovery of an elaborate spying organisation in the pay of the Minister of Court; this rumour is probably traceable to some of the many Persians who are envious of the great man’s success and would not be sorry to see him share the fate of Firuz Mirza and others. Yet another story connects the arrests with a plot to establish a republic, and leaflets advocating this form of government are said to have been distributed from an aeroplane. The most probable story appears to be one which connects the arrests with a Bolshevik plot for the overthrow of the present regime, rile Persian press has denied that any one has been arrested at all, a s tat Client which no one believes.32 7. The general impression I retain from these events is a feeling that the Shah’s mind is not at rest. This disquiet affects all sections of the Administra tion. A contributory factor is the personality of the present chief of police, a new broom who is trying to sweep very hard (in “ clean ” would be inappropriate). It seems paradoxical, but is, I am assured, nevertheless true that the general effect of these arbitrary arrests is excellent, in the sense that Persians, on the whole, feel that they are really being governed by the strong hand of a ruler who will stand -no nonsense. Whether any hidden store of popular resentment is at the same time being engendered remains to be seen. 30 (30) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister Tehran, to the Foreign Office, No. 220 , dated the 10th May 1932. (Copy received under endorse ment No. 93.) I have the honour to forward herewith a translation of the Persian budget for the y£ar 1311, ending March 20th, 1933. This budget was passed by the Mejlise on March 13th last but a copy has only recently been obtainable and even now no offi cial French translation has been made. 2. A revenue of rials 421 ,'400,000 and £787;000 and an expenditure of rials 421,399,870 and pahlevis 407,176 are estimated. Part of the revenue is given in sterling mainly because the holders of the opium monopoly had contracted to pay certain taxes in that currency and because receipts from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are to be so paid. No explanation has been published of the ratio between the pound sterling and the gold pahlevi but the greater part of the £787,000 on the revenue side is expected from the opium monopoly— an uncertain source and no doubt a small surplus has been allowed for, so this sterling figure at its some what depreciated value is likely to balance approximately the 407,176 gold pahlevis on the expenditure side. 3. The value'of Persian currency has fluctuated considerably and comparison with the previous budget can therefore only be rough. The attached statement will however make clear the main points of difference between the budgets of 1310 and 1311 and also the considerable rise both in revenue and expenditure which is provided for this year. 4. The present Minister of Finance is not reputed to be a financial expert but with the help of the Belgian officials in the Treasury-General he keeps a firm hand on departments which, before actually incurring expenditure even on items definitely included in their budget, are required to obtain Treasury sanction. Most depart- meS^are understood to have made a saving on the last budget and the present one will proBabl^be kept to pretty closely. 4. Two other developments during the past two months are worth mention ing and may be related to the foregoing facts. One is that a considerable number of the principal personages belonging to the important tribes in the south, such at the Qashqais, and the Khamseh Arabs, have been summoned to Tehran, where they are either in prison or under surreveillance and obliged to remain in Tehran One of the chief men of the Persian Kurds has also been summoned to the capital* The second development is the expulsion from Tehran of certain preachers who presumed to speak critically from their pulpits of recent enactments of the Majlis especially the new law concerning marriage. J * 5. One of the most trusted agents of the Qavam, who is the titular head of the Khamseh tribes, has had the unpleasant experience of being incarcerated for four days in a dark cell without being told exactly what his offence was. He was shown on many occasions a document purporting to have been written by him, containing treasonable matter. It appears to have been established that the writing was a forgery, and he was then released. 6. These proceedings are to some extent covered by elastic police regulations, though, theoretically, an arrested person has to receive a formal trial. &amp; It is not likely, however, that irregularities will even be the subject of a protest. I re ported in my despatch No. 734 of the 30th December last [see Serial No. (7)] the execution of the Jew Haim at night after five years in prison ; this outrage seems to have caused no outward distrurbances. M33 5. It will be remembered that the budget does not cover all the finances of the Persian Government. The revenue would be about half as large again were the royalties on oil, the revenue from the sugar and tea monopolies and all the proceeds from the road tax included. Of these extra items the oil royalties have of recent years been credited to the Government’s reserves abroad, the revenues from the sugar and tea monopoly taxes have been set aside against railway construction work and the great part of the road lax has been similarly kept for read construction or maintenance. Apart frem these three items the Persian budget is now con sidered to be an inclusive one. 6. On the revenue side the decision to extend the sugar monopoly so that the marketing will be carried cut by the Government, as well as a special tax collected for railway purposes, is expected to bring in an additional sum of almost rials 75,000,000 (Section 4). The profits from the Caspian fisheries concession (section 5) are includ ed for the first time and also the gross receipts expected from the newly-opened sugar refinery near Tehran (section 6), though this latter estimate is ofiset in section 14 on the expenditure side and a net loss of rials 1,000,000 is anticipated on the re finery. These items, together with more than tripled receipts in section 12 on ac count of customs storage—due no doubt to the quantity of goods held up by the trade restrictions—account for most of the increase in revenue. The sugar mono poly, the net profit from which in the budget is estimated at about rials 45,000,000, is to bring in nearly half of the additional revenue. 7. Though part of the Government’s new profits on sugar will be made at the expense of the merchants who formerly distributed this commodity, the increase in revenue will mainly have to come from the pockets of the consumers, whose standard of living is for the most part already miserably low\ 8. As regards expenditure, the Ministry of War (section 5) has been granted another large increase and, including conscription (section 6—interior) it takes up approximately 46°/ 0 of the budget; over and above this percentage apart of the maintenance cost of the new navy should be taken from the vote of the Ministry of Finance (section 15), which has also been increased considerable. The Depart ment of Industry (section 14) has been given a large iiew T allocation, partly on account of the sugar refinery mentioned in paragraph 6 above. In the final section Undetermined General Credits—the amount of rials 30,000,000 has been put against the cost of the sugar and match monopolies. A new Government entertamment fund and unforeseen expenses account for rials 5,000,000 under this same sec tion. 9.

With reference to your despatch No. 435 of the 10th July last, relative to the engagement of Belgian financial experts by the Persian Government, I have the honour to inform you that M. Clavier is well known to the com mercial secretary of this Embassy, who reports that he is very clever but somewhat of a bureaucrat. M. Reyntiens considers that he is the sort of man who would do his best to see that the Persian Government would extract the last penny out of the taxpayer. M. Lefebure has been Assistant Direc tor of Inland Revenue at the Ministry of Finance, where M. Clavier was Director General of Taxation. M. Smets is a “chef de bureau” and an accountant. The Belgian experts are stated in the press to have just left for Persia. 2. Meanwhile, a Persian economic mission is here, and I have the honour to enclose copies of an article from the “Matin” of Antwerp of the 11th July, giving an interview with the members of this mission.(1) (62) Despatch from the Foreign Office, to His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, No. 473, dated 22nd August 1931. With reference to Sir R. Clive’s despatch No. 328 of the 25th June regarding the language to be used in correspondence between His Majesty’s Consular Officers in Persia and the local authorities. I agrpe that it w r ould be undesirable for a dispute with the Persian Government on this matter of procedure to lead to a complete cessation of official correspondence. In these circumstances, you may authorise His Majesty’s Consular Officers at their discretion to meet, so far as they may find it necessary or politic to do so, the demands of the local authorities for a signed Persian text to accompany the signed English text of their communications. 2. I do not consider it necessary for you to return a further reply to the Persian Government’s note of the 18th June on this subject.. (63) (Received on 20th September 1931, with Political Secretary’s letter No. P.- Z.-36, dated 3rd September 1931. Despatch from the Foreign Office, to His Majesty s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, No. 482, dated 26th August 1931. (1) Not printed. ,a ^liHlGN SECRET ^CLOSURE IN SECRETARY'S icompanies, must be signed by authorised officials of the head office of the company as being correct, and (ii) that these signatures must be duly Wa lised. The Article provides for this legalisation to be effected either (a)h~ the competent authorities in the foreign country concerned and the Persian diplomatic or consular officer, or (b) by the diplomatic or consular officer in Persia of the foreign country concerned. 3. Procedure (a) presents no difficulties. I agree, however, that pro cedure (b), which appears designed to provide a possible alternative for territories where there are no Persian diplomatic or consular officers seems less easily practicable, and the legalisation of the signatures of the com pany’s officials, as proposed in the law, may not be within the regular scope of the notarial duties of His Majesty’s Consular Officers. In any case a con sular officer should not legalise a signature with which he is unacquainted The signature to be legalised by him would probably have to be an inter mediate signature, e.g., that of the Librarian at the Foreign Office with which ho is familiar. It is probable however that procedure (b) will seldom arise in practice, so far as His Majesty’s Consular Officers are con cerned, and that the normal procedure under (a) will in most cases be fol lowed. (64) Memo, from the British Legation, Tehran, No. 281, dated 28th August 1931. Britannic Majesty s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Sche dule, on the subject of Persian Law governing Marriage and Divorce. To the Foreign Office, No. 470, August 28th, 1931. Despatch from His Majesty s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 470, dated 28th August 1931. I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship herewith the trans- ? 10 I 1 ° Law governing Marriage and Divorce which was passed bv . f J ] ldlclal Commission of the Mejless on August 13th and which will come into force on September 24th. 2. Formerly marriage and divorce in Persia wure the concern of the re igious authorities and the civil administration had no right of inter- erence therein. The new law makes civil registration of marriage and ivorce compulsory and lays down penalties for non-compliance. 3. Article 3 of the law as originally drafted fixed the minimum age of marriage as eighteen for males and sixteen for females. This stipulation nas now been made somewhat more vague but I understand that the regula tions for the enforcement of the law foreseen in Article XIX will fix the marriageable age as originally mentioned in the law itself. 4- An important and remarkable innovation is the right given to the wi e in certain circumstances to demand a divorce from her husband. For merly the husband alone enjoyed that privilege and the female victim of an unhappy marriage had no recourse against her husband and could not free erself of the bends of marriage unless the husband consented to divorce her. 5. The new law also allows the wife to administer and dispose of her without the consent of her husband. It confirms (Article vv yd the previous interdiction of marriage of Moslem women with non- Moslem men and now subordinates the marriage of Persian women withI 100 1 foreigners to previous authorisation emanating from the competent adminis trative authority. This article is of interest in connexion with the general question of marriages between British subjects and Persian women which is now, so I understand from Mr. Henderson’s despatch No. 263 of May 12th, engaging the attention of the Law Officers of the Crown. 6. The new law would appear to be a reform in the right direction; it enforces a stricter regulation of marriage and divorce and it brings nearer to equality the status of both parties after marriage. The women will no longer be a mbre chattel in the household but will become an articulate being whose role in the family life will become more important in propor tion to her insistance on the rights wffiich the new law confers upon her. 7. Copies of this despatch, with its enclosure, are being sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s Con sular Officers in Persia. Translation of the Marriage Law passed by the Judicial Commission of the Majless for the second reading. A rticle /.—Every marriage or divorce occurring in districts which the Ministry of Justice will fix and notify, should be registered in one of the registers which will be instituted by the same Ministry. If the performer of the marriage or divorce ceremony (sigheh-i- Muzavejat ya Talaq) is not in possession of such registers, the husband is required to refer, within twenty days after the occurrence of the marriage or divorce, to one of the persons who are in possession of one of these re gisters and to register the document of marriage or divorce, failing which he will be condemned to a correctional imprisonment of from one to six imonths. Article II. —The marriage or divorce documents will be considered as official documents if registered in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Justice and as ordinary documents if not registered. The Government will not charge any fees for the registration of mar riages or divorces. A rticle III —Marriage with a person who has not yet reached the state of physical fitness for marriage is forbidden. Any individual who contracts a marriage with a person who has not yet acquired physical fitness for marriage will be condemned to a correc tional imprisonment of one to three years. The offender may also be con demned to pay a fine of from Tomans 200 to Tomans 2000. Trial of cases referring to this article will be heard in the special courts of which the organisation and jurisdiction will be fixed in accordance with special regulations of the Ministry of Justice. Article IV. —The two parties to a marriage can agree to any reserva tion or conditions not incompatible with the exigencies of the legal marriage contract (Aqd) whether made in the course of the same contract (aqd) or by virtue of a separate binding contract (aqd.) It is pos sible for instance to make a stipulation that in the event of the husband being absent for a certain period; or of his ceasing to provide for the expenses of his wife; or of his making an attempt against her life; or of ill-treating her to such an extent that conjugal life becomes unbearable, the wife may become the attorney of her husband or depute another attorney for her husband (according to the islamic precepts a divorce cannot be effected without the actual consent of the husband, translator) to divorce herself or him as the case may be by a definite divorce when proof is laid before the court and a definite judgment is issued. Remark. —Cases referring to this article between the wife and the hus band will be heard in the Court of First Instance in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure. *101 I The judgment of the Court of First Instance is subject to appeal and final revision by the Highest Court (Tamiz) and the period of prescription is six months from the date of occurrence of the event which confers the advantage of the stipulation. Article V . —If any husband or wife deceives his or her partner before ^ the performance of the legal marriage ceremony in such manner that with- out that deception the marriage would not have occurred he or she will be condemned to a correctional imprisonment of six months to two years. Article VI. —Every man is obliged to state clearly to the wife and the performer of the legal marriage ceremony (aqd.) at the time of the marriao-e whether he has another wife or not. This point will be especially men tioned in the marriage document. A man who passes himself against facts as without a wife at the time of marriage and who deceives his wife in this manner will be condemned to the punishment laid down in the preceding article. Article VII. —The criminal procedure in cases referring to the above two articles will be started on the complaint of the woman or the man who has been deceived and if the latter withdraw her or his complaint before the issue of the final judgment, the criminal prosecution will be dis continued. Article VIII. —Wife and husband are bound to treat one another kindly. Article IX. —The expenses of the wife are to be provided by her hus band. Remark. I he expenses consist of a suitable provision of a dwelling, clothing, food and furniture. Article X. The wife can, in the event of the refusal of her husband to provide for her expenses, refer to a court and in such a case will fix the amount of the expenses and will enjoin upon the husband to provide them. If the enforcement of that judgment is impossible, the wife can sue for divoice through the Courts of Justice to the Shari Magistrate. rtide XI. The determination of the domicile of the wife is with the husband unless stipulated otherwise. At tide A//.—In cases where the wife can prove that the abandon- j s d ue f° f ear °f physical injury or financial damage w ich cannot ordinarily be endured and where the extent of that damage or injiuy is established, the court will not issue a judgment enjoining on er to return to her place of residence and so long as she is excused from returning to her domicile, the husband is to provide for her expenses. A rtide XIII. In cases referring to the above article, so long as the rial between the husband and wife has not come to an end, the residence of t e wife is to be determined by mutual consent of both parties, failing which e com t will fix the domicile while taking advice of the near relatives of both parties and if there are no relatives, the court will independently deter mine upon a reliable domicile. Article A/F.—The wife can dispose of her own property in whatever way she likes without the consent of her husband. A rticle XV. As to the right of guardianship of the child: the mother has precedence up to two years from the date of birth of the child and after a period the guardianship devolves upon the father except in the case of daughters who will be under the guardianship of the mother till their seventh year. r A rticle X VI If the mother of the child marries another person unng t e period of her guardianship, or if she becomes mad or if she re uses o accept the guardianship, the father will assume the guardianship so long as one of the above causes exists.Article ZF//.—The marriage of a Moslem woman to a non-Muslem man is forbidden. The marriage of a Persian woman with a foreigner is dependent, even in cases where there is no legal objection to it, on a special permission and the Government will decide in every place the authority which can issue such a permission. Every foreigner who marries a Persian woman without the above-men tioned permission will be condemned to a correctional imprisonment of one to three years. Article XVIII .—In the case of marriages or divorces which are regis tered in the special registers in accordance with Article I of this law, such parts of the stipulations of Articles IV and V of the Personal Status Law passed on the 20th Murdad 1307 (August 11th, 1928), which refer to the report to the Civil offices of marriages and divorces are not necessarily to be observed. Article XIX .—The necessary regulations for the enforcement of this law will be drawn up and prepared by the Ministry of Justice. Article XX —This law will be enforced from the First Mehr Mah 1310 (September 24th, 1931). (65) Memo, from the British Legation, Tehran, No. 289, dated 9th Septem ber 1931.

I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship a comparative schedule of motor transport rates on the main Persian roads during the two years ending March 1931, on the same lines as that contained in Appendix VIII of the last report on this country in the Department of Overseas Trad© series. 2. The last column of the enclosure, which quotes the various rates in pence per ton mile, shows how very much higher the average Bushire-Shiraz rate was than any other. This is probably the stillest stretch of road which motor transport commonly uses in Persia, owing to the steep gradients and the fact that it is subject to frequent closure in winter by snow and mud, the Mashileh swamp just outside Bushire offering a particularly serious obstacle after rain. Moreover security on the road during last year was again affected by tribal risings, the Mamasani, as lour Lordship is aware, having given the government troops considerable trouble. 3.

He told me he was leaving Persia in the first week of September with the young Crown Prince. They are proposing to travel via Russia (not Moscow but the Baku-Shepetovka route) and Berlin and the boy will be left at Lausanne at school. Teymourtache said the boy would be there for, I think, three years, and would then go to some military academv^ —which one it had not yet been decided. The plan is that the Prince should be seven or eight years away from Persia altogether, cwith at most one or two visits home to see his father. He will spend at least one full year travelling about the world as his opportunities of leaving Persia once he returns there for good may be few and far between. The Shah feels the prospect of this long separation most acutely and has only decided on it by the sternest self-discipline. 2. Teymourtache himself will be away till the end of November. He told me that he would certainly visit England, but he could not say yet exactly when. He intends to take a cure at Vichy. (71) Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 467, dated 25th August 1931. With reference to my despatch No. 451 of August 21 [S. No. (70)] on the subject of the journey to Europe of the Crown Prince and Teymourtaehe, I now understand that the Shah’s eldest daughter will also accompany the party. Her Imperial Highness, who is now fourteen years old, will go to school in England. She will be under the general care of Madame Diba, the wife of a leading court official, who is himself going to Europe for three months. 2. Teymourtache’s own young son and daughter are also proceeding to Europe, and will be companions to the Crown Prince and the Princess res pectively. The Crown Prince will be in the care of Dr. Mo’addeb ed-Doleh (Hafici) in addition to his former governess, Madame Arfa’, a French woman married to a Persian who is an ex-Governor of Mazanderan and Sultanabad. 3. I hope to be able to obtain confirmation of this information at a din ner-party which Teymourtache is giving on August 27th, in anticipation of his departure. There is however a possibility that the dinner will not take place, His Highness having had a riding accident two days ago and being now in bed with fever under the care of Madame Diba.

The Sheikh is not unduly worried about losing the lands he has never cultivated but article 4 may cause him some annoyance if he is unable to find the necessary documents of leases accorded in the past to his peasents. He hopes to be able to find them as most of his documents were safely lodged ^in a Bank at Basrah at the time he was arrested in 1925. The word “trees’’ means of course date palms, which are the principal cultivation in Khuzistan and in the cultivation and exploitation of which he and his peasants were associated. 5. Much will depend on the equitable” valuation and whether the Persian Government is really desirous of giving the Sheikh a fair deal* it is possible that both sides are tired of the long quarrel and that the ques tion will be settled in a spirit of give and take. 4 6. The Sheikh, moreover, wishes to feel himself a free man and able to travel about the country without the constant attendance of a Police Officer and especially he hopes, once this question is settled, to go to Europe for medical treatment. ^ 7. It will be noticed in the preamble that mention is made of differ ences in accounts between the two parties. The Sheikh made an agreement with the Mills paugh Financial Mission to pay Tomans five hundred thousand for arrears of taxes ; Tomans one hundred thousand being paid in cash, and the balance to be paid in instalments over a number of years. Having made the first payment, the Sheikh was arrested before any part of the balance fell due and none of it has been paid. At the same time he has personally received no revenues from his properties during the last six years, although small allowances are said to have been made to his family in Khuzistan from these revenues. The Ministry of Finance proposed to insert a clause in the agreement providing for a mutual cancellation of financial claims, but the Sheikh while not turning down the proposal definitely, suggested that it might be left for later negotiation. The Ministry of Finance agreed, though reluctantly, I am told. In the end there will probably be a mutual cancellation but the Sheikh, who by such a cancellation would be the loser, wishes to keep the question open as he considers—rightly or wrongly—that it may be a weapon with which to bargain if, when the details of transfer come to be settled, he is not satisfied with the way they have been carried out. 8. This attitude on the part of the Sheikh is not unnatural for if a just balance were to be struck between his outstanding debt of Tomans four hundred thousand and the loss either wholly or partly for the last six years of his revenues, a very large part of which is said to have accrued either to the Government or to its officials, it would be found that the Sheikh would have considerable claims on the Government. 9. Article 2 of the Agreement will, the Sheikh opines, confirm his ownership of the land on which the foundations of the new Consulate in Ahwaz have been laid. He argues that he has established his right thereto by spending more than Rupees fifty thousand on the building already. The assessors will possibly accept this contention and in the light of this possibility His Majesty’s Government should not lose sight of the question of at least a moral financial obligation to the Sheikh in considering the provision of a consular building at Ahwaz (please see Mr. Henderson’s despatch No. 425 (K. 8786/376/234) of the 31st July 1931. 10.

Translation of a Note from the Ministry of Finance to Sheikh Khuzal Khan, 21st Murdad 1910-August 13, 1931, No. 19213. Sir, With a view to removing the differences existing between the Govern- raent and Your Excellency in respect of the Crown domains transferred to .you and the transferred Crown Domains which you have purchased as well113 as other properties inherited and bought by you in Khuzistan; and also in order to remove the differences regarding accounts between the Government and yourself, I have to state that the following arrangement, about which agreement has already been reached between you and the Ministry of Finance, has been approved by the Government authorities by virtue of the f* decision of the Council of Ministers No. 3425 of 2nd Murdad 1310 (July 25, 1931). * 1. In respect of the landed properties, house and shop properties of which you claim ownership, you are invited to produce in each case the original decrees and documents. 2. The house and shop properties belonging to you which are situated in the towns and villages remain under your own authority. 3. You will have no claim to property on the sea-shore to a depth of one thousand zars (metres) or on the banks of navigable rivers to a distance of one farsakh (four miles) on each side and the lands within these limits will belong to the Government. Where, however, within these limits you have planted any trees or undertaken any cultivation, such trees and cultivation will, by virtue of clause 6, be valued and carried to your account. 4. Any claims which you may have to properties occupied by the villagers, etc., should be referred to the proper courts. In case judgment is given in your favour, the properties in respect of which you obtain a judgment will be valued and dealt with in accordance with Clause 6. 5. As regards the Crown lands transferred to you and also the Crown lands bought by you, those pares of them will be recognised as belonging to you which you have cultivated and made prosperous, each part within its own limits. You will have no claim to lands which you have not cultivated and which lie outside the limits of the cultivated lands. 6. With the exception of properties situated on the sea-shore and on the banks of rivers and excluding the house properties in the towns, all the lands and properties you have inherited and the Crown lands purchased by you or transferred to you will be valued in an equitable manner by assessors, of whom one will be appointed by you, one by the Government and a third assessor will be appointed by both parties. In exchange the Government will transfer to you Crown lands situated in the neighbourhood of I ehran or Qazvin up to the equivalent value of the lands taken over from )ou. Such properties will be valued in the same manner. It is requested therefore that you signify in writing your agreement to the Six Clauses mentioned and that you send to the Ministry of Finance the originals of the decrees and documents which you have in your posses sion for the Ministry s perusal and consideration. You should also introduce your assessor so that the Government may appoint its assessor and take steps for the appointment of the third assessor, which appoint ment is to be made to the satisfaction of both parties.

Sir, ,.&gt; , I £wA Ply t0 y ? Ur let , ter (EncL X ) No - 19213 of 21, Murdad 1310, (August 13, 1931), regarding the removal of the differences existing between the raveinment and myself in respect of the Crown lands transferred to me, the Crown lands purchased by me and the other properties which I have inherited and purchased in Khuzistan, as well as the differences relating to accounts between us, I have to state that I have already signified my agreement to the arrangement proposed, the details of which are set outin the letter under reply. I hereby express my satisfaction in writing with the said arrangement which is outlined below and which has been approved by the Government in its decision No. 3425 of 2nd Murdad 1310 (July 25, 1931). 1 With regard to my landed properties and house properties, I am to produce the originals of the decrees and documents in all cases. 2. House properties belonging to me which are situated in the towns and villages are to remain in my possession. 3. I shall have no claim on any property on the sea-shore up to a depth of one thousand zars and on the banks of navigable rivers to a distance of one farsakh on each side and the lands within these limits will belong to the Government. In cases, however, where I have planted trees or made cultivation within these limits, such trees and cultivation, by virtue of Clause 6, shall be valued and brought to account. 4. Any claims which I may have to landed properties occupied by the villagers, etc., shall be referred to the proper courts. If judgment is given in my favour, the properties in respect of which judgment is given in my favour will belong to me and will be valued and dealt with in accordance with the stipulations of Clause 6. 5. The Crown lands transferred to me or those which I have purchased will consist of those lands which I have cultivated and made prosperous within the ordinary boundaries of each one of them. I shall have no claim to lands which have not been cultivated and which are outside the limits of the cultivated properties. 6. With the exception of properties situated on the sea-shore and on the banks of rivers (as mentioned in Clause 3) and excluding landed property (as mentioned in Clause 2), all the lands inherited and properties purchased as well as Crown lands purchased and transferred to me shall be valued at an equitable rate by assessors, one of whom is to be appointed by the Government, one by me and a third to be appointed by agreement between the two parties. The Government shall transfer to me for the equivalent of the properties valued, Crown lands situated in the neighbourhood of Tehran and Qazvin which will be valued in like manner. In order to put this arrangement into execution I shall introduce my assessor at an early date so that the necessary action may be taken. , (Signed) KHAZAL JABER.

M.’s Charge d’Affair’s Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 488, dated September 8, 1931. In continuation of my despatch No. 467 of the 20th August (S. No. 71), I have the honour to report that the Crown Prince of Persia left Tehran for Switzerland on the 5th September. His Imperial Highness was accom panied by the Shah as far as Pahlavi, where His Majesty saw him off. Teymourtache and Diba left on the 6th September at dawn to rejoin the main party at Pahlavi, where all boarded a special steamer for Baku on the afternoon of the 7th instant. 2. The party consists of those mentioned in my despatch No. 467, with the exception of the Shah’s daughter, who it was decided, should remain for the present in Tehran. The Crown Prince was accompanied by his Persian professor, so that during his long stay in Europe he shall not forget his mother-tongue. With the party are also Colonel Reza Quli Khan, the director of the Pahlavi Bank and his wife. The colonel is to study banking in Lausanne for three years.3. After having bid farewell to the Crown Prince, the Shah, attended by a small suite, will travel by the Caspian coast road to Astara and Tabriz thence through Persian Kurdistan to Kermanshah and return to Tehran' His Majesty will be away for some twenty days. 4. The Persian Ambassador in Moscow will meet the Crown Prince in Baku and escort him through Russian territory. 5. Teymourtache, after having placed the Crown Prince in school at Lausanne, will visit Berlin, where his Armenian wife has to undergo a further operation. He will then visit Vichy for a cure, go to Italy to be present at the launching of one of the Persian gunboats, and then hopes to pay a visit to both Paris and London. He expects to return to Persia in December. (78) (Received on 31st October 1931 y with Political Secretary's letter No. P. Z.~ dated 15th October 1931. Letter from the Foreign Office, London, to H.

In this letter the Board suggest that, having ascertained whether the registration fees prescribed in the Law are to be levied on nominal or on issued or on paid-up capital and whether the capital referred to is the Company s total capital (of whatever kind) or only the capital circulating in Persia, you should address a protest to the Persian Government against this measure as being a further disguised attack on foreign and, in parti cular, British interests. ^ ?• If you should doubt the probable utility of such a protest to the Persian Government, and the desirability, on this or other grounds, of af ressin £&gt; repiesentations to them in this instance, I request that you will report your views on the action suggested by the Board of Trade and await lurtner instructions from me before approaching the Persian Government on - ese lines. I shall, however, be glad in any case to receive a report on the question raised in the last paragraph of the Board’s letter. Letter from the Board of Trade, to the Foreign Office, London No. P.

It should he noted in this connection that in this country no fees are levied on foreign companies for registration. Certain documents have to be registered but the total charge for the registration of such documents does not exceed £1. I am also to suggest that His Majesty’s Representative should ascertain and report whether the registration fees are to be levied on nominal or on issued or ? on paid-up capital and whether the capital referred to is the Company s total capital (of whatever kind) or only the capital circulating in Persia. His Majesty’s Representative will doubtless satisfv himself on this point before addressing to the Persian Government the represent ations suggested above, as the magnitude of the grievance of British com panies with interests in many parts of the world—as is the case with large insurance companies— will obviously depend to a great extent on the answer to this question. Letter from Fire Offices’ Committee (Foreign), to the Board of Trade, dated the 20th August 1931. Reference 3128131. I beg to (refer to your letter of the 1st August advising me that the regulations which the Persian Minister of Justice is empowered to make under the new Persian Law, regarding the registration of Companies have already been issued and are in force. I have submitted this information together with the regulations which you were so good as to forward to us, to the interested Members of my Committee and they have directed me to approach the Board of Trade on the subject of the registration fees which are required by the law. In the opinion of the Insurance Companies these are much too high and it is felt that strong exception should be taken to the manner in which they are assessed. As the Board of Trade will have observed, these fees are fixed on the basis of the capital of the companies, which is a most unusual arrangement. In other parts of the world where the registration of Companies is called for, the fees are nominal. The capital of an Insurance Company must be looked at in relation to the scope of its business and where this is world wide, it is altogether anomalous to use it for assessment purposes in a particular country. With the development of Persia, it was hoped and anticipated that an opportunity would have been afforded permitting the British Insurance Companies to increase their business, but the institution of these high registration fees must have the effect of compelling the Companies to consider their position with a view to deciding whether it would be worth their while, having regard to the present volume of insurance in the countrv, to continue their operations. It is hoped that His Majesty’s Government will see its way to make representations to the Persian Government with the object of inducing the latter to reconsider the question of the registration fees required under the new law.

I enclose a copy of the speech which I delivered and also a French translation of His Majesty’s reply. f i? speeches had been delivered the Shah desired the Minister or roreign Affairs to assure me that he sincerely desired to live on the est of terms with Great Britain, a great country with which Persia had ties and common interests. I replied suitably and then enquired alter the Crown Prince. This reference to his son appeared to give the a genuine pleasure and his rather heavy expression became quite animated while he said that he was receiving excellent reports. 4. His Majesty showed similar pleasure when I told him that Sir Percy Lorame had asked me to be sure and recall him to His memory. He replied that though there were more difficult questions to discuss when Sir Percy Lora me was Minister here than now or perhaps at any other time relations were never better thanks to his tactful and patient handling of them. 5 In accordance with the practice which has been in force for some w? ^ e S a ^ on was waiting in an ante-room. It is left to the Minister to judge the right moment to request permission to present them. I now did so and His Majesty first enquired what journeysColonel Dodd had made in the course of the summer—a hint, though not an unfriendly one, that His Majesty takes a supervisory interest in the activities of Military Attaches. He then turned to Mr. Havard and the following conversation which he had, no doubt, arranged beforehand with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, followed:— The Shah. —I hear that you are shortly leaving Persia. Mr. Havard.—Yes, with Your Imperial Majesty’s permission. Minister for Foreign Affairs.—Mx. Havard has been many long years in Persia and knows our country thoroughly. The Shah. —Yes—Mr. Havard is very well known in Perisa and everybody likes him very much (to Mr. Havard). Are you going to an appointment in London ? Mr. Havard. —Yes, Sire. The Shah. —I hope very much that you are going to be appointed to the Department which deals with Persian affairs for with your knowledge you will be able to render great service to your own country as well as to Persia. (To Minister for Foreign Affairs). In almost every phase of our policy we have a common interest with Great Britain and although we have had our little differences they have in no way altered our friendly relations. M. F. A. —England is a very great nation and conducts its foreign relations with sagacity and sincerity. The Shah. —Yes, that is true and I am very glad to say that our relations are so friendly. Persia for her part only wishes to be honoured as a country for her to honour those who honour her. England can rest assured that Persia’s policy towards her is one of sincere friendship and I see nothing that can alter those feelings of sincere friendship. As Mr. Havard is shortly leaving us I wished to have this short discussion on policy for him to take home with him. 6. It will be interesting to see whether concrete effect is given to this markedly friendly, if curiously staged, demonstration. 7. A copy of this despatch, with its enclosures, is being sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Text of the Speech delivered by Mr. R. H. Hoare, on the occasion of the Presentation of his Letters of Credence to His Imperial Majesty the Shah, and of the Shah’s reply. November 3rd, 1931. Sire, I have the honour to hand to Your Imperial Majesty the Letters by which the King and Emperor, my August Sovereign, graciously accredits me to Your Majesty as his Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipoten tiary as well as the Letters of Recall of my predecessor. It is a great responsibility as well as privilege for me^ to have the honour to represent my Sovereign at Your Imperial Majestv s Court and I hope that I may count on the powerful support of Your Majesty and the cordial collaboration of Your Ministers in my efforts to maintain and strengthen the ties of friendship which so happily exist between our two countries. In formulating my most sincere wishes for the prosperity of Your Im perial Majesty and the Imperial Dynasty I venture to add the expression of my confident hope that the Persian people, with the help of God and under the wise guidance of its Sovereign, will continue along the road of peace, order and progress towards the fulfilment of a great destiny.119 Mons’eur le Ministre.

(84) Memorandum from the British Legation, Tehran, No. 358, dated 4th November 1931. His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the subject of:—Persia’s trade with the British Empire and Russia. Reference :—Tehran Printed Letter, No. 197 of 30th June 1931 (Serial No. 48). Mr. Lingeman’a depatch No. Overseas Trade (B) 189, dated 3rd November 1931. Despatch from the Commercial Secretary, His Majesty’s Legation, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. Overseas Trade (B) 189, dated November 3, 1931. I have the honour to inform Your Lordship, with reference to my despatch No. Overseas Trade (B) 115 of June 30th last (Enel, of S. No. 48), that the Persian Customs statistics fonthe year ended 22 March last will not be published for some months. I have however been able to obtain certain advance figures relating to the trade of Russia and the British Empire with Persia waich are of special interest in view of the recently concluded Perso- Soviet Commercial Treaty. I have incorporated these figures in the attach ed tables. r 2. Ihe imports front the United Kingdom—nominally from the British Empire with the exception of India—show a surprising increase both in value and as a percentage of the total, there having been an increase in these imports from the United Kingdom of £300,000 in spite of a fall of £3 million in the imports of the country from all sources. Unfortunately we ha\e lost a good deal of ground in the cotton piece goods trade, as will have been^seen from the comprehensive report attached to my despatch No. Overseas Trade (B) 175 of October 18th last, so that it will probably be found, when details are available, that we owe this increase to the larger imports of machinery, metals, etcetera, effected by the Anglo Persian Oil Company. The Indian trade,, which does not benefit by the inclusion of the latter class of imports, has dwindled appreciably, a contributory factor perhaps being the closer determination by the Persian Customs of the real origin of imports.3. ’I he fall in Russian imports both on a kran and sterling basis and as a percentage of the total import trade is little short of remarkable but then Russian trading methods are notorious for the harm they do the competition with a relatively small expenditure of ammunition, in the form of goods dumped on foreign markets. 4. With regard to exports other than oil, whereas the takings of British India have only varied between 8 per cent, and 8 8 per cent, of the total during the last three years those of the United Kingdom fell from 12 7 per cent, to 9 G per cent, during last year. The Russian takings went back to the 1928-29 level of 34‘5 per cent. 5.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 532, dated September 23rd, 1931. I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship, herewith, a copy of a despatch from the Acting British Vice-Consul at Resht regarding the threatened expropriation (which has since taken place) by the Municipality of Lahijan of a certain piece of property belonging to Monsieur Dracos Pilides, a Greek citizen. The property consisted of a silk cocoon drying shed and the site was required for street widening. His Majesty’s Govern ment are, as Your Lordship is aware, in charge of Greek interests in this country. 2. Upon receiving this despatch I addressed a note, of which I enclose a copy, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, urging that no further steps should be taken until the question of compensation had been equitably settled. The date of this note was August 19th. At the same time I in structed Mr. Vice-Consul Davis to inform the Governor of Gilan of my action and to request him to see that in the meanwhile the municipality made no further move towards expropriation. 3. On August 31st I received a telegram from Mr. Davis stating that the municipality had told Mr. Pilides that, unless he destroyed the drying- sheds within forty-eight hours, the Municipality would destroy it them selves. Mr. Davis added that the forty-eight hours expired that same even ing (August 31st) and that he had again urged the Governor to prevent further action pending the receipt of instructions from Tehran. I there upon addressed a second, and urgent, note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, of which a copy is enclosed, informing him of the threat made by the municipality and requesting him to stop further proceedings, if it were not already too late to do so. I added that if it proved to be too late, I must reserve the right to address him further on the question of compensa tion. / 4. On September 3rd I received a telegram from Mr. Davis stating that, according to Mr. Pilides, the destruction of the property had begun on September 2nd and was then proceeding. I instructed Mr. Davis by telegram on September 9th to obtain and forward to me by despatch full particulars on which to base a claim for compensation, which I would pro- povse, subject to the concurrence of His Majesty’s Government to present to the Persian Government in default of a local settlement. I warned him against encouraging Mr. Pilides to suppose that I was likely to obtain an early settlement in Tehran and advised Mr. Davis to make every effort to obtain a settlement locally. I also mentioned the question orally to Feroughi on September 6th, but found, as was perhaps to be expected, that my notes had not been submitted to him personally. He promised, however, to make enquiries. * 5. Since the despatch of my telegram of September 9th, I have received from Mr. Davis two further despatches, of which I also enclose copies. The first shows that prior to the destruction, the Municipality offered Mr. Pilides a sum of three hundred tomans as compensation for property valued at five thousand tomans. The second gives certain details regarding the property which has been destroyed and indicates that a local settlement is improb able. I may add that according to Mr. Davis, who recently visited Tehran, the property is on the outskirts of the town and there is no apparent reason why the new road could not easily have avoided it. I have also received from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs a note, dated September 14, of which a copy is enclosed, stating that instructions have been given to the local authorities that if the property is needed by the Municipality they should act in accordance with the municipal regulations with regard to compensa tion. The trouble is that there are almost unlikely to be any such regula tions (see paragraph 6 below).6. I have reported upon this question at some length, because it is possible that a similar difficulty may arise at any time in connexion with property belonging to a British subject. Such difficulties did in fact arise in 1928 and 1929. I need not trouble Your Lordship with the details at this stage, but the view which Sir Robert Clive then took was to the general effect that while expropriation in itself could not be resisted, adequate compensation could, and should, be exacted. I enclose a copy of a circular despatch which he addressed to Consular Officers in Persia on April 17 1929, which shows the position at that time. 7. The legal position of British subjects in this respect is presumably governed by Article 1 of the Judicial safeguards which states that they will enjoy the fullest protection of the laws of the country and will receive the same treatment as Persian subjects. There is, however, no law em powering municipalities to expropriate and destroy property’for the pur poses of street widening. There may be in some cases municipal regula tions, but so far as can be seen the municipalities simply take the property by force, and the Persian owner, unless he is an influential man, seldom receives even the smallest compensation. In these circumstances the authorities are no doubt content to remain without legal sanction for their acts, since it is inconceivable that any law on the subject could pass the Mejhs if it did not provide for compensation. The Persian Minister for foreign Affairs did indeed inform Sir Robert Clive in 1929, in connexion with one of the cases mentioned above, that municipalities were bound to carry out ther duties in accordance with the law. But a request for further particulars as to this law received no reply. 8. It is clear that when Persian subjects are treated with so much mjustme, a mere appeal for national treatment would be of small avail But I presume that no Government could excuse itself for illegal actions against foreign nationals on the ground that it also acted illegallv towards its own subjects. The laws of Persia recognise private property and until the law is changed so as to make expropriation without compensation legal, wt? reSU T bly entitled t0 claim the Protection of the law, by Person subjects^ 1 * ^ protectlon can or cannot b e effectively claimed secure rnmnJT 'T* 1 the * e that I propose to endeavour to tfon nf S v f ° r B ? tlsh Sl ^ ects if further cases occur.

I should be glad if I may receive Your Lordship’s instructions as to presenting a claim, as suggested in paragraph four, at an early date. 12. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Atneus. Letter from His Majesty’s Vice-Consul Resdt., to His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, No. 36, dated August 8th, 1931. I have the honour to report that Mr. Dracos Pilides a Greek national long established as a merchant in Resht, owns an installation for drying and storing silk cocoons at Lahijan. This installation is situated on the proposed alignment of the new avenue which the Municipality of Lahijan is making through the town to connect the Resht road with the Langarud road and make a through route for motor vehicles travelling from Gilan to Mazandaran. The Municipality of Lahijan therefore tore down the fencing in front of Mr. Pilides’ installation and informed him that the silk-cocoon drying-sheds would be destroyed within one month. 2. At this stage Mr. Pilides brought the affairs to mv notice and I wrote to His Excellency the Governor of Gilan requesting him to order the Municipality of Lahijan to determine the price of the installation and pay compensation to Mr. Pilides before proceeding to the destruction of the installation. In reply His Excellency stated that the Municipality would agree to compensate Mr. Pilides for the losses he would suffer, within the limits of its budgetary credits, and in instalments. As the Municipality’s budget only amounts to Ts. 12,000 per annum while Mr. Pilides estimates the value of his installation at Ts. 5,000, he does not consider that this proposal is satisfactory, since any payments made are bound to be small in amount and! uncertain in time. 3.1 have suggested to Mr. Pilides that the Municipality might be pre vailed upon to rebuild the silk cocoon installation for him at its own cost and charges instead of paying compensation, and he is now considering this suggestion. He would however much prefer that the value of the installa tion should be paid to him in cash at once before the destruction is accom plished. I have informed him that to the best of my knowledge and belief there is no treaty and no law which we can invoke as a reason for insisting that full compensation should be paid to him in cash before his property is destroyed. I therefore beg leave to request you to instruct me whether there is in fact any treaty or law on this subject, or whether any precedents exist in which the Persian Government has clearly accepted the principle of immediate payment of compensation when property belonging to foreigners is required for municipal improvements. Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, No. 398, dated 19th August 1931. \ I have the honour to bring the following facts to Your Highness’ notice. Monsieur Dracos Pilides, a Greek national long established as a merchant in Resht, owns an installation for drying and storing silk cocoons at Lahijan. This installation is situated on the proposed align ment of the new avenue which the Municipality of Lahijan is making through the town to connect the Resht road with the Langarud road and make a through route for motor vehicles from Gilan to Mazanderan. The Municipality of Lahijan therefore tore down the fencing in front of Monsieur Pilides’ installation and informed him that the silk-cocoon dry ing-sheds would be destroyed within one month.At this stage Monsieur Pilides brought the affair to the notice of His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Resht, who wrote to His Excellency the Governor of Gilan requesting him to order the Municipality of Lahijan to determine the price of the installation and pay compensation to Monsieur Pilides „ before proceeding to the destruction of the installation. In reply His Ex- ^ cellency stated that the Municipality would agree to compensate Monsieur Pilides for the losses he would suffer, within the limits of its budgetary credits, and in instalments. As the Municipality’s budget only amounts tomans twelve thousand per annum, while Monsieur Pilides estimates the value of his installation at Tomans five thousand, he does not consider that this proposal is satisfactory, since any payments made are bound to be small in amount and spread over an inordinately long period. As a Greek national, Monsieur Pilides is entitled to the protection of this Legation, and I therefore request Your Highness to be so good as to cause immediate instructions to be issued to the Lahijan Municipality to take no further action in regard to this property until the matter has been thoroughly investigated and the legal position elucidated. There exists, as far as I am aware no' law covering the expropriation of private property by local municipalities, and Monsieur Pilides is entitled to the protection of the laws in force, which recognise private property. His Excellency the Governor of Gilan has himself recognised this fundamental principle in promising some measure of compensation, but it is evident that the Muni cipality is only entitled to carry out such improvements as it can afford to pay for in full and without undue delay. Before, therefore, any steps are taken to demolish the property in question, I should be grateful if Your Highness would be so good as to assure me that the sum claimed by Monsieur Pilides as the value of his property will be paid to him in full as compensation and to inform me in what manner this compensation will be paid. Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, to the Persian Minister for Fo&amp;eign Affairs, Gulhek, No. 414, dated 31st August, 1931. In my note No. 398 of August 19th (foregoing), I had the honour to inform Your Highness of a proposal to destroy certain property belonging to a Greek national, Monsieur Dracos Pilides, resident at Resht and to request Your Highness to be so good as to take steps in order that the pro perty should not actually be destroyed until the question of the compensa tion payable to Monsieur Pilides had been settled. In a note dated August 26th (Shahrivar, 3 1310), No. 18115/8105380, the Director-General of the Ministry was good enough to inform me that my note had been communicat ed to the proper quarters for enquiry and necessary action. 2. I have now received information to the effect that Monsieur Pilides has been told by the Municipality of Lahijan that he must destroy his property (a silk cocoon installation) within forty-eight hours or that th^ Municipality will destroy it themselves. Owing to the time taken for this information to reach me, the forty-eight hours in question expire tonight (August 31st). 1 his and the fact that the Ministry is now closed makes it impossible for me to place the facts before Your Highness in the time available. 3. I can in consequence only appeal to Your Highness to send urgent instructions to the 1 effect that, if the destruction has not already been carried out, it shall be delayed until the question has been settled between the Ministry and this Legation. fShould it, however, prove that the destruc tion has in fact taken place, I must reserve the right to address Your High- ness further on the question of compensation. 4. I may add that both before and since the communication of this peremptory decision by the Municipality, His Majesty’s Vjce-Consul has informed His Excellency the Governor of Resht of the communication made to Your Highness by this Legation and urged him to delay further action pending a settlement of the question in Tehran.Letter from His Majesty’s Vice Consul, Resht, to His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, No. 43, dated 26th August 1931. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your despatch No. 22 of the 19th August last on the subject of the property of Monsieur Dracos Pilides at Lahijan, and to report that I at once informed the Governor of Gilan that you had taken up the question with the central government. 2. Between August 8th, when my despatch No. 36 was written, and August 25th, when your despatch No. 22 reached me, certain developments occurred in this case which are perhaps worth recording. On August 11th I wrote to the Governor of Gilan pointing out that M. Pilides had about 5,000 mans of silk cocoons stored in the drying sheds and requesting that the Municipality of Lahijan should grant him a delay of fifteen days to pack up and remove the cocoons. On August 17th M. Pilides’ son informed me that the destruction of the drying-shed had been begun. It afterwards transpired that only a small section oLthe sheet iron roof had been removed when the Governor’s order came through granting the delay. 3. In the meantime M. Pilides, who was himself at Lahijan, had been invited by the Municipality to appoint two arbitrators who were to proceed to the drying-shed in company with two arbitrators appointed by the Muni cipality and determine the value of the building and the loss which M. Pilides would suffer as the result of the destruction of part of it. The arbitrators submitted a report estimating the cost of destroying and re building part of the drying shed at a little over three hundred tomans. The Municipality therefore called upon M. Pilides to accept an arrange ment for the payment of the sum agreed upon by the arbitrators. M. Pilides contends that when part of the drying shed is destroyed, the rem nant will be useless to him.&lt; He therefore considers that the Municipality should pay him the whole value of the building, which cost him five thous and tomans, as he states. I imagine that the fact that he appointed arbit rators will be considered by the Municipality as binding him to accept their finding. 4. In conversation this morning His Excellency the Governor of Gilan stated to me that the ground on which the installation is built does not belong to M. Pilides. Only the building is his. The silk cocoons stored in the drying shed are also not Mr. Pilides’ own property, as his son admit ted to me. They belong to a Persian merchant of Resht who has hired the installation from M. Pilides for the season. Despatch from His Majesty’s Vice Consul, Resht, to His Majesty s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, No. 53, dated September 12th, 1931. With reference to your telegram No. 18 of the 9th September, I have the honour to report that yesterday I went to Lahijan with M. Panayotis Pilides, the son of M. Dracos Pilides, to view the silk cocoon installation which they own there. The installation was built four years ago. It con sists of a large weighing-sed where the cocoons are weighed on arrival; a drying plant, motor driven, in which the cocoons are dried by hot &amp; steam chamber in which the cacoons are exposed to kill the silkworm inside, and a large drying shed, covered with a galvanised iron roof but open to the air on all four sides, in which the cocoons are stored after they ha^e been treated with steam or hot air until the moment arrives for them to be packed into bales and despatched for export. There is also a house w ^ e M. Pilides’ ammt lives The whole was enclosed with a wooden fence. Hie ground does not belong to M. Pilides, but was leased by him from a Persian for ten years. The lease has still four years to run. 2. It is the large drying-shed, sixty-two metres long and fourteen metres wide, which fell within the alignment of the new avenue which the Lahijan Municipalitv are constructing. The whole of the shed, not a P ar t of it, has been razed to the ground. Not a vestige is left standing. Muc127 of the woodwork used in its construction has been broken and is only fit for firewood. The canvas shelves on which the trays of cocoons rest have also been torn down ruthlessly and are too tattered to be re-used if the drying shed is rebuilt. Some of the bricks, timber and canvas have also been carried off by the workmen engaged in the destruction and by the general ^ public, who roam unchecked over the site now that the fence has been torn down. m I 3. M. Pilid'es states that he filed an application in the local Heeis tration Department for the registration of his installation' which was valued for the purpose at Ts. 5,000 He estimates that the tilambar (as the drying-shed is called locally) cost Ts. 3,000 of this. The three^ hundred tomans odd which the Municipalitv ofTered to pay M. Pilid'es by instalments would not go far towards the mst of reconstructing the tilambar. 1 4. Apart from the loss which he has suffered in respect of the drying shed, M. Pilides points out that he is also entitled to compensation for the loss of about half of the ground which he had leased and which he was entitled to use for four years to come yet. 5. 1 have told M. Pilides that it will probably be necessary for him to make a claim against the Persian Government through you for the com pensation to which he appears in equity to be entitled. l'presume that for this purpose an affidavit or statutory declaration from M. Pilid'es will be SUp 2, orte ^ co P ies .of his correspondence with the Municipality ot Lamjan. For the description and value of the property I imamne that the tet evidence will be a certified copy of the application for registration filed in the Registration Department’s archives. 8 ' to rennrf tw g i r n k possib,l ' t y of reaching a settlement locally, I regret subiect Ltclv I w aV r bee n lmabl . e to lnterview th e Governor of Gilan on the ubject lately, His Excellency having been fully occupied with arranee- of H R^the 8 W f r R rf a Shah t0 and the d^aZe the discrenZv hlf f ° T 11 is to be remarke d however that amount ckinied bv M P l^ SUm ° ff , ered b - v the Municipality and the at a compromise is Jfther remote S ° the posslbilit y of arrivin ?

It seems not improbable that the energy now being displayed by various municipal authorities in carrying out town improvement schemes will result, as it has alieady in some instances, in the demolition and appropria tion of property belonging to British subjects. 2. The attitude which I propose to adopt in this question will gener ally speaking, be found in my note, No. 299 of November* 20th to the’Acting Minsitei for Foieign Affairs, a copy of which is enclosed for your informa tion and guidance. 3. You will be aware that the safeguards provide only that British subjects shall not be treated less favourably than Persians. I propose how ever to base myself on the law generally obtaining in civilised countries and I have every hope that in this way it will be possible to secure fair treat ment for British subjects. 4. I recently discussed this question with the Minister of Court who stated that there was no law on the subject of compensation for ex-propria- tion and that the only safeguard he could suggest was that property should be registered' with the competent Persian authority (see my circular des patch No. 58 of the 21st December, 1927). In this case, he said, should it be necessary to expropriate property so registered, the value at which it had been registered would be taken into consideration. 5. I request therefore that you will remind British subjects in your district that they would be well advised to register their property forth with. Letter from H. M.’s Minister Tehran, to Persian Minister, for Foreign Affairs, No. 299, dated the 20th November 1928. » Your Excellency will no doubt remember that, in his note No. 229 of September 7th, Mr. Parr drew Your Excellency’s attention to the possibi lity that the proposed town improvement scheme at Shiraz might entail the demolition of a house belonging to a certain Mr. Gerrard, a British subject and pointed out that adequate compensation must in this event be paid to the owner. 2. I have now received a report from Ilis Majesty’s Consul at Duzdap stating that the Military Governor proposes, in connection with the Duzdap Municipal town planning scheme, to demolish houses belonging to certain British subjects without compensation. As a result of His Majesty’s Consul’s representations the Governor has, however, agreed to two or three days respite in order to refer the matter to Tehran. 3. I need hardly point out to Your Excellency that His Majesty’s Government are unable to admit that the Persian Government has the right to treat British subjects in this way and I have accordingly the honour to request Your Excellency to be so good as to cause immediate instructions to be sent to the Military Governor of Duzdap that in no case is property owned by a British subject to be demolished without adequate compensation. 4. I have further the honour to recpiest that the Governor may be instructed that before demolition of a building by a British subject takes place the compensation to be paid to the owner should be settled direct with him and on a satisfactory and equitable basis. 5. 1 shall be glad to learn at an early date what action Your Excellency has been able to take in this matter.Desp\tch from the Foreign Office London, to the Honourable Patrick ^ Ramsay, C.M.G., etc., etc., Athens, No. 430 dated the 26th October 1931. You will have observed from Mr. Dodd’s despatch No. 532, of Septem ber 23rd, a copy of which was sent to you direct, that he has requested authority to present a claim to the Persian Government on behalf of a Greek citizen, Monsieur Dracos Pilides, in connexion with the expropria tion, without adequate compensation, and subsequent destruction of a silk cocoon drying shed by the Persian municipal authorities in Gilan, who required the site for street widening. 2. I shall be glad if you will inform the Greek Government of the circumstances reported in Mr. Dodd’s despatch, and enquire whether, hav ing regard to the general principles and customs of international law, and the relevant articles of the Perso-Greek Treaties enclosed in Mr. Harvey’s despatch No. 426 (C. D.) of August 28th, 1931 they wish a claim to be put forward to the Persian Government on behalf of Monsieur Pilides in de^ fault of a satisfactory local settlement, and whether they have any further observations to offer on the case. 186) (Received on 29th November 1931 with Pol. Secy.’s letter No. P.-Z.-46, dated 2nd November 1931.) Despatch from the Foreign Office, to H. M.’s Minister Tehran, Iso. 640, dated the 4th November 1931. With reference to Mr. Dodd’s despatch No. 532 of September 23rd (S. No. 85) regarding the expropriation by the municipal authorities in Persia of property belonging to foreign nationals, you will have observed from the enclosure in my despatch No. 621 of October 28th that I have instructed His Majesty’s Minister at Athens to enquire whether the Greek Government wish you to put forward a claim to the Persian Government on behalf of Monsieur Pilides in default of a satisfactory local settlement. A further despatch will be addressed to you on this point on the receipt of Mr. Ramsay’s reply. 2. In paragraphs 7 and 8 of his despatch under reference, Mr. Dodd stated the grounds upon which he proposed to approach the Persian Gov ernment in the hope of obtaining adequate compensation if similar difficult ies should arise in the future in connexion with property belonging to a British subject. There is no objection to the use, in case of need, of argu ments such as those proposed by Mr. Dodd, but I consider that it would be undesirable to rely solely on such arguments, which might be held to imply that if the Persian Government were to introduce new legislation to make expropriation without compensation legal, then His Majesty’s Governmen would have no further cause for complaint. In these circumstances it will be preferable to base your main contention, not merely on the right o British subjects to the protection of Persian law, which at present does no appear to deal with the question of expropriation at all, but also on the tac that expropriation of the property of foreigners, without fair compensa tion, is treatment which is not in accordance with the principles an customs of International Law. British subjects in Persia have the un doubted right to be treated in accordance with the principles and customs o Ipternational Law, as the Persian Government have admitted in Article of the “Judicial Safeguards” of May 10th 1928. It will also be re^. IT l' bered that under Article 9 of the Anglo-Persian Treaty of 1857 Bn js subjects in Persia and their trade have a right to most-favoured-na i treatment in everv respect, which gives them the night to the treatment, u * for example, to Greek nationals under Article 1 of the Perso-Greek . V of the 9th January 1931, viz., treatment in accordance with the principand customs of International Law for their interests. persons, property, rights and f 3 ’ li? j mprC f a S e that ’ ^ ^ matter principle, the Persian Govern- ment would dispute the proposition that expropriation of a fore^ne™ property without compensation is not in accordance with the principles and customs of International Law. For your own .information only however I should add that some doubt has been expressed by international lawvera on the point whether the confiscation of the property of a foreigner witbo™ compensation is contrary to International Law if, firstly, it is legal unde^ the ocal municipal law and secondly, if that municipal law applies and is applied to nationals and all foreigners alike. The prevailing authority however, inclines to the view that confiscation of a foreigner’s property without compensation, is in all circumstances contrary to International Law and this view is supported by certain passages in judgments given by the Permanent Court of International Justice o b j (87) Memorandum from the British Legation, Tehran, No. 374, dated the 17th November 1931. His Britannic Majesty s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign i^ocietary to the Government of India and has the honour to trans mit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the subject of :— The Company Registration Law of May 24th, 1931. To the Foreign Office, London, No. 643 of 17th November 1931, with enclosures. Despatch from H. M. s Minister Tehran, to the Foreign Office London, No. 643, dated the 17th November 1931. t I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the Note which I addressed to the Persian Government on receipt of your predecessor’s despatches Nos. 588 (S. No. 78) and 649 of October 9th and November 6th respectively relative to the enforcement of the Company Registration Law of May 24th, 1931. 2. I also attach a letter from the representative of the Alliance Assur ance Company to the Commercial Secretary together with one to the Com pany itself which explain the situation in so far as insurance companies are concerned. You will note that the Russian insurance company, Gostrakh, has already paid the registration fee of two hundred and fifty pounds so that it will be difficult to persuade the Government to reduce this fee. 3. The Atlas, Motor Union and Commercial Union, represented by the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, have so far done a very small amount of business in Persia and, as stated in the attached letter, they have ceased their operations. The Manager of the Corporation, however, has informed the Commercial .Secretary that they will probably resume work if the regis tration fee is fixed at no more than one hundred pounds. In his opinion it is only the Alliance, of all the foreign insurance companies working in Persia apart from Gostrakh, which could afford to pay as much as one hundred and fifty pounds. Copies of this despatch and enclosures have been sent to the Govern ment of India, His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq and to the Department of Overseas Trade. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated the 14th November 1931. I have the honour to remind Your Highness that no reply has been received as yet to Mr. Dodd’s Note No. 405 of August 21st last in which heenquired whether all shipping companies trading in Persian waters should register themselves under the Company Registration Law and if so what pa'rt of their capital was liable to the registration tax. 2 The capital of Persian companies is almost invariably employed in Persia only whereas the majority of foreign companies operating in Persia have interests so widely scattered that they employ a very small proportion of their total capital in this country, whilst they may have cogent reasons for declining to form separate companies for the handling of their Persian business. The only possible way of placing foroign com panies on the same footing as Persian companies therefore would be to assess the registration tax on the capital which the former actually have in circulation in Persia. If this were the case there would be no reason to regard the law as constituting discrimination against foreign companies; a definite ruling would thus be to the general interest as it would remove the uncertainty which is so harmful to business. 3 It may interest Your Highness to know that in Great Britain no fees are levied on foreign companies for registration. Certain documents have to be registered but the total charge for registration of such documents does not exceed one pound sterling. I believe that no country m the world other than Persia imposes registration fees to be levied on the total paid up capital of foreign companies, irrespective of the amount actually employed within the country. • 4 With regard to insurance companies I have learnt with satisfaction that the regulations which have been drawn up by the Ministry of Justice allow for the imposition of the following reasonable taxes on fire insurance :— for less than three months 0-0125 per mille on the amount insured; for more than three months 0-025 per mille on the amount insured; On all other insurances :— O'5 per cent, on the premium, but I feel bound to draw the attention of the Imperial Government to the representations which I have received against the proposed registration fee of £250, and to submit the view that this figure appears excessive in view of the small development of insurance business in Persia. Insurance is a form of thrift which I feel sure the Persian Government have no wish to discourage by adding unduly to the expenses of foreign companies. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Highness the assur ance of my highest consideration. Alliance Assurance Company, Limited. 1 Persian Agency. Tehran, 5th November, 1931.

Cher Monsieur Lingeman, d , Projet de loi sur les Droits d’Enregistrement et les Taxes payables par e* Compagnies d’Assurances en Perse. D’aprhs le projet de loi etabli par le Ministre de la Justice et ® texte a paru dans les journaux en date du 7, Octobre, les Lompagu d’ Assurance devraient (si la loi etait vot£e): (1) Payer un droit fixe de 5,000 Rials pour leur enre o^ S p reme ^i Q jg # ceci irrespectif et sans 6gard au montant du capital de la C ompaq 5,000 Rials font £250 or.B, On policies for other Kinds of insurances (except Fire), the tax is 0*5 per cent on the premium which is the same as 1 anna on every Rps. 12.8 annas premium in Mesopotamia. We take the liberty of pointing out the following remarks on these fees: 1. The duty payable on fire policies is to be calculated on the amount insured. For other classes of insurances, the tax is calculated on the premium. 2. On a Policy covering Bank premises for one year for the amount of £10,000, the premium at 1 per mille amounts to £10. The duty payable would be at O'0025 per cent. (6d. per £1,000) and amounts to 5/sA. or 2-5 per cent, of the premium collected (2J per cent, on £10). This duty is to be charged for a policy in force for a period of 3 months or more. In order to give you a concrete idea of the taxes to be charged and their proportion to the premium, we give below a table of 5 common insurances; Banks, Houses, warehouses, shops, woodworking risks :— Amount Insd. Purpose of Ins. Rate. Premium. Tax Percentage prop, to premium. £ £ per cent. 10,000 Banks . . * • • 1 per mile 10 5/ 2*5 10,000 Houses . . . • • 2 20 6/ 1*25 10,000 Warehouses . . . • 3 30 6/ 0*833 10,000 Shops 6 „ 50 5/ 0-5 10,000 Woodworking risks • 10 100 6/ 0-25 The tax calculated on the amount insured is the same for all the five cases and the percentage of the tax “par rapport to the premium is inverse ly proportionate to the premium. For other classes of insurance the duty will be calculated on the premium at the rate of 0-5 per cent. With regard to registration fees, it is suggested to amend the Bill and to reduce substantially the initial amount of £250 proposed, reducing it to £150 probably. The Bill is still under study in the Parliament Commission of Justice. We shall not fail to keep you informed on the new development. In the meantime, we remain. ( 88 ) Memorandum from the British Legation, Tehran, No. 379, dated the 18th November 1931. His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-jomea Schedule, on the subject of Industrial development. • ... 4 Reference .—Tehran printed letter No. 279 of 26th Augunt 1931 (Serial No. 59). Mr. Lingeman'e despatch No. Overseas Trade (B) 201 of 18th November 1931-135 Despatch from the Commercial Secretary, British Legation, Tehran to the Foreign Office, London, No. Overseas Trade (B) 201, dated 18th November 1931. I have the honour to inform you, in continuation of my despatch of 26th ^ of August, No. Overseas Trade (B) 147 (Enclo. of S. No. 59), that in so far as it concerns textiles there are as yet no concrete results to be reported re garding the many enquiries for the textile machinery mentioned in para graph 4 of my previous despatch. I recently enquired from Dr. Linden- blatt what the position was as regards the various schemes for cotton spin ning mills and whether the National Bank had approached, or intended to, the British manufacturers whose names I had furnished at his request. He replied that he had no news to impart except that no companies had as yet been actually formed. He was most insistent in stating that the Nation al Bank did not wish to interfere themselves: catalogues, specifications and quotations would be given to the interested parties for them to choose and decide. He did not wish to do anything that might give rise to the sug gestion that he was favouring German, British or any other country in the placing of orders. I have no doubt whatsoever that this is the result of a conversation which Dr. Lindenblatt had with Teymourtache soon after my interview with His Highness of August 6th. 2. I have heard from another (confidential) source that the German tex tile expert, von Huser, has been inspecting likely sites for the installation of cotton and woollen mills, and has recommended to the Government the establishment of a woollen factory from the yarn to the finished article, to produce from 250,000 to 300,000 metres annually, including dye works. He considers Kermanshah to be the most suitable place for the exploitation of this industry, and proposes that a cotton factory should also be erected there, presumably to be worked by the same power plant as the following estimates seem to imply:— i Woollen Factory:— Rs* Machinery ....... r ' . . buildings ....... . . power plant .... .... working capital ^ . , Tomans 190,000 60,000 100,000 150,000 Total 600,000 Cotton Factory:— R«. Machinery buildings £ . . . working capital ... ...... • • • • • • 90,000 35,000 60,000 Total 175,000 3. The capital is to be subscribed by the public, but it is safe to presume that the usual lack of initiative and co-operation will prove a stumbling block in the way of a speedy realization of this scheme as for the various /others. ' ■ &lt; 4. The local press periodically publishes short paragraphs of industrial activities. At the end of August the formation in Meshed was announced of a company to start a wool factory, for which the material “will be bought in Germany”. No confirmation, or indeed any news, has been received: on the contrary, His Majesty’s Consul-General reports that there have been no developments in the scheme for establishing a cotton spinning factory, and that the local representative of Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Company is as pessimistic as ever about the Persians ever making a success of business.'An Australian farmer who inspected Wonckhaus’ factory has reported the wool to be of very inferior quality. He considers the sheep to be much neglected. 5. The schemes for Cotton mills at \ezd and Kerman are still hanging fire, the shareholders apparently stipulating on the firm that obtains the order for the machinery participating to the tune of at least Krans 500,000 at each of the two above mentioned places. 6. Two German companies, cne producing woollen under-clothing and the other artificial silk tissues, were also reported in the Press as having requested authority to transfer their machinery to Persia. 7. A spinning mill has been decided upon by merchants and notables in Aragh (Sultanabad) with a capital of Tomans 300,000 in order to supply the yarns necessary for the carpet industry. 8. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Resht reports that in view of the in creasing difficulty of obtaining imported cloth, a number of new looms have recently been set up in Resht to weave cotton, silk and woollen fabrics, whilst many silk dealers have set up machinery for spinning silk at Lahijan instead of exporting the raw cocoons as formerly. This is due to the demand for silk yarn for the interior of Persia for weaving purposes. 9. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and His Majesty’s Acting High Commissioner for Hraq.

No. (78)], transmitting copy of a despatch addressed to His Majesty s re presentative at Tehran instructing him to address representations, unless he should see any objection, to the Persian Government on the subject of the Persian Company Registration Law of 24th May, 1931, I am directed by the Board of Trade to transmit to you herewith copy of a letter on the sub ject, addressed to the Department of Overseas Trade from the Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom, together with copy of correspondence between this Department and the Board of Inland Revenue. I am to suggest, for Lord Reading’s consideration, that a copy of these letters should be sent to His Majesty’s Representative at Tehran for his, in formation and for any action he may be able to take in connexion with tne instructions contained in the despatch referred to above. In connexion with the last paragraph of the Board’s letter [Enclo., of S. No (78)1, to vour Department of the 24th September, it will be observed that the Chamber of Shipping state that according to the information fur nished by their member, the tax in question is not confined to the capital employed in Persia. A copy of this letter has been sent to the Department of Overseas Trade. f.ETTEE FROM THE CHAMBER OF SHIPPING OF THE UNITED KINGDOM^ LONDON to the Board of Trade, No. Reference K/H, dated 2nd October 1931, Taxation — Persia. With further reference to your communication of the 12th June, ref. 4132/1921, the Chamber has received a copy of the Act and further informa tion from a member regarding its effect.The Act provides that “any foreign company wishing to engage in in dustrial or financial operations in Persia through any branch office or repre sentative or by other trade means, must .... be registered ... ”, The fee for registration of companies is based on the total capital employed'^ It is observed that:— (1) The taxation of the capital of a foreign shipping company is con trary to the principle embodied in the League of Nations draft Conventions, under which the provision that “income from maritime shipping . . shall be taxable only in the State in which the real centre of management is situated”, is applicable to recurrent taxes on capital. (2) The tax is not confined to capital employed in Persia. The inequity of taxing the total amount of a non-resident Shipping Company’s capital was dealt with in the Chamber’s communication to the Foreign Office of the 1st June. In the case of one company, with world wide operations, and of whose capital only a very small proportion is used in Persia, the tax will amount to £452. (3) A further objection to the provisions of the Act is the fact that the tax is based on a sliding scale. In some countries, where registration is re quired, no annual expense attaches thereto. In other cases there is an annual flat rate by way of trading license. A statement is attached containing some information in this matter. It will readily be seen that there is a distinction between such a flat rate trading license, and the Persian tax based upon a percentage of capital. A tax of the latter description lends itself readily to increases. The member in question has applied for 6 months grace before payment. It is earnestly requested that your department will take whatever steps may be possible to bring these considerations before the Persian Govern ment, with a view T if possible to the exemption of non-resident shipping, or at least to the limitation of the tax to capital employed in Persia, or the sub- •titution of a flat rate.

In reply to your letter of 21st October (CRT - 4110/311 l ject of the Persian Company Registration Law dated 24th May 1931 I am . directed by the Board of Inland Revenue to say that, so far as they can’jJdge f om he copy of the Law enclosed with your letter, the registration fee p a f able thei eunder is not an annual or recurrent tax but a single payment except in so far as an increase of a Company’s capital may entail an increa s ; of the original amount of the fee. tIlls 18 the position, it would not appear to the Board that the principle embodied m the League of Nations Draft Conventions with regard to ship ping businesses, to which reference is made in the letter of 2nd October from the Chamber of Shipping, is a relevant consideration to be brought before the Persian Government. Apart from the fact that the principle is one laid down by the League to be observed in bilateral agreements between countries, it is applied in the Draft Conventions to annual or recurrent taxes only. The print of the despatch enclosed with your letter is returned here with. The Board would be obliged if they could be furnished with a copy for retention.

From Military Attache, Angora Dated November 4, 1931. Ridvanoglu Husrev Bey’s remarks regarding .Persia and Kurdith situation. * (Similar letters to Baghdad and Tehran.) Letter from the Military Attache, His Majesty’s Embassy, Angora, to His Majesty’s Ambassador, Angora, No. 5, dated 4th November 1931. Ridvanoglu Husrev Bey, Turkish Ambassador at Teheran, is spending some months on leave in Turkey. Owing to illness, his family has not joined him in Teheran, but he hopes to take his wife and younger child with him when he next returns there. Husrev finds Persia an interesting post, but considers that two years there will be sufficient. He was posted there, last year, to deal with the deli cate situation which resulted from the Kurdish revolt and the Turco-Persian frontier discussions. He would otherwise have proceeded to Warsaw as Ambassador. He finds Persia in many ways very backward, although giving credit to the Shah for much progress. Inclined at first to scoff at the Persian army, he now believes that they have seriously improved and thinks that in twenty years they may be of real use. At least, they now wear a uniform, and he has seen mixed brigades, formed to deal with brigands and unruly tribesmen, which had a real fighting value. He confirmed my supposition that the best elements in the Persian Army are Azerbaizanis. Husrev Bey gave me a summary of last year’s operations against the Kurds which agrees with the estimates which I had formed. There w r as no general mobilization on the part of Turkey, but two divisions, a mountain brigade, and some fifty aeroplanes were sufficient to settle the question once and for all. This year there has been no serious revolt in Turkey, and only minor ones in Persia. He informs me that the Tabriz-Bowanduz-Baghdad road is not as well built in Persia as in Iraq. He has the lowest opinion of the prospects of railway construction in Persia. On the general economic outlook of that country he is equally pessimistic. i i i (92) (Received on 2Cth December 1931, with Political Secretary's letter Xo. P.- Z.-49, dated 3rd December 1931.)

I have the honour to report that the Shah arrived at Hamadan late on the afternoon ot the 26th and left again early next morning. He took no apparent interest in local matters, and had in fact sent orders ahead for the striking of the tents which, in accordance with the usual custom, had been pitched outside the town for his reception For their part also the townspeople and the peasantry did not seem to Hp very interested in the Royal visit, and large crowds did not line the roads the time of the bhah s arrival. Those who had collected in this wav were given no chance of seeing him, for the closed car drove fast right up to the house of Ibrahim Khan Gharagozlou, where the Shah spent the night. With the heads of the various Government Departments, who awaited him outside this house, the Shah did not pause to speak, except to tell the present of the Western Court of Appeal that he had heard com?iafnt' the local courts.

Hissuccessor managed to postpone his arrival until after the Royal visit. Issues of new uniform were made to the troops, and the prisoners were taken to the public baths and shaved. 3. His Majesty reached this town on the 22nd September at 3 p.m., com- * ing from Senneh, which he had left that morning. His journey was broken at Kameyaran for luncheon. He drove direct to the house of Ali Khan, Amir-i-Kull, the leading notable, chief of the Zanganeh tribe and Deputy for Kermanshah, where he spent the next two nights. Amongst his suite were Aghai Assaad Sardar Assaad, Minister of War, Amir-i-Nizam, the Grand Master of Ceremonies, Agha Shakah-ul-Mulk, Comptroller cf the Royal Household, and Dr. Amir Khan Aalam, Amir-i-Aalam, private physi cian. 4. The Governor-General, Prince Assadullah Mirza, Shahab-ud-Dowleh, K.C. V.O., and the local officials were awaiting the arrival of the Shah at the gates of the house, and, on alighting, he called up the Governor and expressed his dissatisfaction at the large number of his subjects seen by him during his journey and in the town not wearing the Pahlavi hat and up-to-date clothing. It is said that the Shah was particularly incensed as the Ministry of the Interior had drawn the attention of the local authorities some time before his arrival to the inadequate compliance with Government orders for the change of dress. His Majesty’s host, Amir-i-Kull, was later able to assure him that the people he had seen were Kurds from outlying villages not within the jurisdiction of the Governor-General. 5. Strict measures had been taken to safeguard the Shah on his arrival, and a communique of the authorities prohibited the presentation of petitions, and the throwing of flowers during his passage, whilst no one was allowed on the house-tops along the way. Policemen with revolver in hand were stationed on the roofs during the Royal passage. This last measure led to comments that the Shah appeared to be more afraid of attempts upon his life than during previous visits. 6. On the evening of his arrival, the Shah inspected the stables of the Amnieh and expressed his satisfaction. His subsequent inspections of the troops and police, barracks, stables, etc., pleased His Majesty, and he special ly commended the Officer Commanding, Sarhang Haji Ali, Kazm Ara, or the appearance and discipline of his command. I he Rais-i-N azirue . Sarhaug Mohamed Khan, Naissari, was also congratulated. Both these officers are honest, capable and hard-working and well deserve the approba tion. The Rais-i-Amnieh also is stated to have been commended. I his officer, Sarhang Mehdi Khan, Moatazedi, had been publicly beaten and degraded by the Shah on a visit here some years. During his visit to the barracks the Shah recognised an aged subaltern officer with whom he had served. He made him a gift of money, and gave orders that he should he retired with a pension. 7. His Majesty received in audience on the 23rd September the local ulema, addressing them for five minutes. On receiving the deputation of local merchants he drew their attention to the benefits of the Trade Mono poly Law, and pointed out that it was a suitable time for them to import machinery to manufacture the requirements of the country. The leading trader greeted these words with the customary Inshaallah, and was repri manded, the Shah emphasising that he wished them to take prompt action in view of the excellent economic conditions. Upon the suggestion uia e )y another merchant for the abolition of the taxation of Persian products an upon exports, the Shah showed anger, and ordered the deputation to go. He then received the departmental heads. Fathullah Khan. Nassir Diwan, Deputy for Kermanshah, was accorded a better reception, His Majesty con descending to ad just his Pahlavi cap, which appeared to him to be worn at a rakish angle. The Shah refused to receive the local princes of the^Amad-ud- Dowleh family, and is reported to have said that&gt;he knew of no a yan. «v 14* \ 8. The petitions received by the Shah whilst at Kermanshah amounted to 600. These were referred to the Governor-General. Amongst these was an application on behalf of many families of Jelu Assyrians settled at Baqubah in Iraq for permission to settle upon his estates at Shahabad (Harunabad). The Shah made no definite reply. 9. On the 22nd September six brigands, who had attacked traders and villagers in the vicinity of Sahneh, were arrested by Amnieh guards. The Shah was informed and gave orders for their immediate execution. Two of the men were hanged at Ghorgavisheh, one of the villages molested, and the other four were shot at Sahneh on the next day. 10. The Shah left Kermanshah early on the 24th September for his estates at Shahabad, and passed through this town again on the 26th Sep tember on his way to Hamadan. He was then reported to have been in Rood humour and to have treated the Governor-General better than whilst he was staying at Kermanshah. Whilst at Shahabad His Majesty received the chiefs of tribes and visited the two local schools, one of which gives agricul tural instruction. He gave orders for some improvements at these. 11. The bad temper of the Shah is attributed to his dissatisfaction with the officer commanding at Senneh for the bad condition of the troops and military material in that town. He is said to have placed this officer under arrest. Nothing appeared to please His Majesty in the principal city of Persian Kurdistan, and he remarked that the town had made no progress since his last visit. Another report states that he received a telegram on arrival announcing the destruction by fire of a military depot at Tabriz. 12. As a sequel to the Shah s visit, the Governor-General has obtained an undertaking from local tailors and hat-makers not to make the Kurdish head-gear and clothing, whilst village headmen have been ordered to pre vent the wearing of these. r 13. My impression of the visit is that it has been beneficial for the town and people. Officials have become more attentive to their duties, whilst those whose past actions are not above reproach have had a fright. This remark applies to the Governor-General also. If the people object to the Shah s lough tongue and manners, many in Kermanshah remember the time when he was here as a subaltern. These do not speak of him with respect, but do adii ^ 6ar me ^ 0&lt; ^ s » whilst acknowledging what he has QIPD—T63(C) 4PD— 16 -2/'♦T* ✓ / ! 9 31 N No „ p, 3 .-]vt/31 .

Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (41). Letter from II. M.'s Minister, Terran, to His Highness Mirza Mahomed r\ Alt Kan Forottghi, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Tehran, dated the 3rd June, 1931. I have received from His Majesty’s Consul General, Bushire, a report to the effect that the Assistant Governor of the Persian Gulf Ports has demanded that in future the Consul General shall write his official commnnications in Persian or, if the communication is in English and Persian, that he should sign the Per sian text. I have the honour to inform Your Highness that there has long been a gene ral rule that llis Majesty’s Consular Officers shall use the English language in their communications with local authorities, in spite of local regulations in certain countries demanding the nse of the local language in correspondence. The rule has, however, been mollified in some cases where the question has arisen by allowing the transmission of non-guaranteed translations in the language of the country. In these circumstances, T am unable to discern any reason for a departure from the general rule in the case of Persia. If at certain posts His Majesty’s Consular Officers have in practice dispensed with the English text and trans mitted signed commnnications in Persian only, this has been done solely as a matter of convenience in the case of documents of minor importance, where the Officer’s command of the Persian language has been such as to preclude all probability of error. I have therefore no authority to instruct His Majesty’s Consul General at P.ushire to discontinue Hu- practice hitherto in force, and I shall be grateful if provincial Governors may be instructed to accept letters in English with Persian translations attached. T avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Yonr Highness the assurance of my highest consideration.

Bespat c’' ^rom IT. M. s Minister. Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 332, dated the 26th June, 1931. Tt may be of interest on the eve of my departure after nearly five years re sidence m leiiran 1 o review briefly the changes which have occurred since 19^6 and the present trend of Persian policy as I see it. .p . ^ hen 1 arrived here Mostofi el Mamalek, one of the old school of inert 1 rime Ministers, was at the head of the government. Dr. Millspaugh directed the imances with dictatorial power. Teymourtache, the rising star, was in Mos- eow attempting to make a treaty with the Soviet Government, whilst His Im perial Majesty, by them constitutionally established on the throne, appeared to be degenerating into a debauchee. i i P e i ce F 1 h° r , 1926, Teymourtache returned from Moscow. He at once ook the Shah m hand, and in January, 1927, was launched the great scheme le i 1( a Ji a - a / f rom Caspian to the Persian Gulf which was to be at once IYr/ m k em ^nasty and a visible proof of the renaissance oi 5* Foreign countries were soon to feel the effects of the new nationaksni 1]1 .^F lier by the Minister of Court. In March the agreement come to in 192&lt;&gt; with Imperial Airways was scrapped by the simple expedient of declining to Fu ml incalion to the Majliss Persian adherence to the International ' ir . - ( ai\ r-ntion which had been one of the conditions of the agreement a very ypical instance of Persian bad faith. Two months later, after a somewhattheatrical pronouncement by the Shah all thp tma+i™ ni. r were denounced including the French and Spanish p.wpetual treatiefthf place treaty of 185^ with Croat Britain alone bein&lt;&gt;- exch rlo/l Af I. ’ r 1 Cabinet was reconstituted Mukhbar es Snltanch rejladng MostofiTs alUre head 1 rime Minister, while Daver who had been brought in as Minister of Justice and Firuz Mirza as Minister of Finance three months before Mosto i resigned, were continued in office. The Minister of Court, howevei eon nue to act as ntei-mediary between the Shah and the Cabinet-in fact he had assumed all the powers, if not the title, of a Grand Vizir. Two months later J r - Wdlsimigh’s four rears’ contract terminated. The Persian Go“™tT elmed to renew it except on terms which deprived him of all real authoritv ml which it was known he would refuse to consider. Shortly after hi ard th mendters of his financial mission returned to America. Dr. Millspam 1 was no great financier, but he had rendered unquestionable service to the IV-sTan Government. The Persians, with a lack of gratitude which seems hardly hm a, .ceiwic^ n ° W ° rd '' l ' gret 3t his and 110 w °rd of thanks for his ^ . fV ^ a immber of new treaties and conventions were concbuied with the Soviet Government and, m order to make them more palatable to the public a deliberate bnt quite unconvincing anti-English campaign was engi neered on the pretence that Great Britain had thrown in her lot with the Mullahs m their opposition to the Pahlevi regime in general and to the new conscrip tion law in particular. J his inspired campaign became so virulent that for some t\u&gt; months, with the approval of your predecessor, I practically ceased to hav* any relations with 1 lie I'ersian Government. It was not until the middle of 1 ecembeT that the Minister of Court made a move to restore normal relations \Mth Ills Majesty s Legation. I had a long audience with the Shah at the instance of J evmonWaehe and the train was laid for the conclusion of the tariff autonomy treaty which was signed on May 10th, 1928. At that moment Amdo- 1 ersian relations appeared not merely to be normal, they might even be said to be Inendly Simultaneously, letters were exchanged recording the permission to Imperial Airways to fly along the Persian shore of the Gulf on the route to India tor a period of three years from the inauguration of the service. The service actually started in April, 1929. In the autumn, on mv return from leave, negotiations Mere begun for a commercial treaty and a general treaty to settle all outstanding questions. 6. Meanwhile the now nationalism which was to regenerate Persian and convert her trom a backward Asiatic state to a progressive and enlightened mem ber ot the League of Nations was moving apace. The National Bank was found ed m the summer of 1928 with a German as chief manager. A German-American syndicate received a contract to construct some two hundred miles of rail wav in the North and South as the initial stage of the great trunk line, a French m ireless^ expert was engaged to take charge of the high powered wireless sta tion in Tehran which was to render Persia independent in her outside commu nications of the telegraphic land lines, negotiations were set on foot with Italy through the medium of two specially engaged Italian naval officers for the train ing m that country of Persian naval cadets and the eventual purchase of a small ileet of warships. A financial adviser, a forestry expert and a mining engineer were engaged from German}'. From France came a number of school teachers, a public health adviser who was to assist in the foundation of a great central hospital in Tehran on grandiose lines and an archaeologist and fine arts adviser who was to found a national museum, while as an aftermath of the Millspaugh financial mission there still remained an American adviser on road construct ion and an American railway enginer to supervise the work of the German-American syndicate. No branch of the public service appeared to have been negelected. At the same lime, as a further milestone on the road to progress, the national costume of the long pleated frock coat and ‘ Kola ’ (a black Fez) was, by Im perial order, changed to a short jacket and peaked cap—the famous Pahlevi hat. 7. In November, 1928, on the occasion of the opening of the newly elected Mejtiss, the Prime Minister read out a speech (drafted, as I subsequently learnt, by the Minister of Court) in ivhich pointed allusions were made to the necessity of revising and modernising certain old concessions. Those of the Anglo Per sian Oil Company, the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Indo-European Tele graph Department were clearly indicated. It is unnecessary to enter intu lha55 details of these concessions or into the manner in which these different insti tutions reacted 1o the hint. Suffice it to say that Sir John Cadman with a large staff came out to Tehran a few months later (in February, 1&lt;)29) in an attempt to negotiate a revision and at the same time, a prolongation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company concessions. The attempt failed, but negotiations have not actu ally been broken off, although Teymourtache, with a view to blackmailing the Company into offering better terms, recently instituted in an organ of the Teh ran press a most venomous and libellous attack upon them. The Bank made no move until a year later their hand was forced and for the sum of two hundred thousand pounds £200,000 in cash and certain minor privileges they agreed to renounce, as from 1931, their right of note issue. The challenge to the Indo- European Telegraph Department resulted in the conclusion last September by the Government of India of an agreement with the recently formed Cable and Wireless Company to withdraw the Telegraph Department entirely from Persia as a corollary of which the Indo-European Telegraph Company, which had al ready been absorbed by Ihe Cable and Wireless Company, was simultaneously withdrawn on March 1st of this year. Persia is thus left in undisputed posses sion of the land lines hut without the means of using them for an international service or, it may be added, the competence to do so. A telegraph service to Europe is, however, still maintained by land line to Bushire and thence by cable via India. 8. Up to the spring of 1929, the programme of national regeneration ap peared to be making headway. In April, however, a serious outbreak occurred in the province of Ears. The Qashgai and a portion of the Khamseh tribes re volted, and it was feared at one time that the Bakhtiari wmuld join them. Not until the auuimn did the movement die down, but it cannot he said that the Per sian Government succeeded in suppressing it in fact, they yielded to most of the tribesmen’s demands. An attempt was as usual made to make His Majesty’s Government the scapegoat. It was said that we had supplied the tribesmen with arms and that His Majesty’s Consul in Shiraz, disguised as a Dervish, was help ing them with advice ! Finally, what can only be described as the great Law rence myth (that is, the rumoured presence of Colonel Lawrence wherevei t rouble was to be found) was regenerated in order to put the seal on onr perfidy in an attempt to exculpate the shortcomings of the Persian army. One interesting sequel to this tribal revolt was the downfall of Firuz Mirza, the Minister of Finance. The Shah, wrapt in a maze of suspicion, con jured up the idea of a Qajar rising. Firuz, as a Qajar Prince, was arrested, as was his cousing Akbar Mirza, the Governor General of Fars. His Majesty even felt doubt as to wliethe the Mnister of Court was entirely above suspicion. New elements hostile lo Teymourtache were introduced into the Cabinet and it was several months before His Highness regained his old ascendancy. 9. Meanwhile, in August, the Lawrence bogey having been successfully laid for the time being, negotiations for a general treaty and a commercial treaty with His Majesty’s Government were once more resumed. As was to He expected, the Persian demands were exorbitant. They not only included the re mission of the whole pre-war and war time debt but the cancellation of all claims, the cession ol the islands of Tamb and Bn Musa and the provision of a fleet of gunboats and patrol boats. Discussions went on through the autumn. They continued intermittently until the autumn of 1930, since when they have been in abeyance. The points at issue have been greatly narrowed down and if the Persians were genuine in their desire to reach a settlement both treaties could very soon be concluded. 10. By November, 1929, coinciding with the beginning of the slump in America, black clouds again appeared on the horizon. Silver, on which the 1 ersian currency is based, was falling rapidly in vlaue. The exchange rate of ' r ra * 11 an&lt; ^ ^ a hen from fifty to seventy to the pound. The Imperial Bank of Persia was accused of manipulating the exchange for their own base ends. It.cannot bo said 1 hat the Imperial Bank rose to the occasion or met the .situ ation with skill. r l hey certainly did not. They offered advice, it is true, as to how ^to meet the situation, but scornfully repelled the proposals of the National Bank that the exchange rate should he fixed in agreement between the two Banks. . . Lindenblatt seized the opportunity to disparage the Imperial Bank and to incite the Minister of Court against this “ obstructive and unhelpful British institution ” with the result that, in February 1930, a law was passed under rri'* C V a con . m bs8ion was appointed to fix the rate of exchange from dav to da&gt;- this Commission was dominated by the German manager of the National Bank and the rate was arbitrarily fixed at sixty Krans to the pound. The ImpendBank 8 control of exchange was gone for ever. Dr. Lindenblatt had indeed suc ceeded ui Ins object of undermining the position of the Imperial Bank and of establishing the National Bank in a privileged position. It was inditferen to him whether the rate iixed was economically justified or not. With the heln of Government funds which were temporarily placed at his disposal, he was able to sell exchange and draw away many of the old clients of the Imperial Bank Simultaneously a law was passed establishing, as from March, 1931 a currency based on gold. But here it was impossible to ignore the Imperikl Bank as under their concession, they still had for another twenty years the sole ri-ht of note issue. A bargain was eventually made under which the Bank’s right was bought out tor the inadequate sum of two hundred thousand pounds £200 000 and certain privileges granted which included their being placed on an equa’lity with the National Bank lor ordinary Banking business. The Imperial Bank undoubtedly could have, and should have, obtained an additional one hundred thousand pounds £100.000 for their right of note issue 11. By the autumn of 1930, the economic situation had become, as it still remains, the main issue in Persian politics, although Persia has probably been affected much less than most countries by the world economic depression The arbitrary fixing of the Kran at the rate of sixty to the pound (later raised to ninety) was done in defiance of expert advice and resulted, as was anticipated in wholesale evasion. Business continues to he done outside the Banks at tIn- Bazaar rate and it is quite beyond the power of the Government to stop this. 12. The gold exchange law, another phantasy of the Minister of Court, seems equally doomed to failure. The intention was to bring the new currency (one Pahleyi-one pound, one Rial-one shilling) into force in March of this vear, hut this has now been postponed until September. The public are quite in the dark on the subject. Nothing is known as to how it is proposed to control the new currency, while the Bankers fail to see how it will be possible to keep it from going to a discount. 13. Finally, the Trade Monopoly Law can only, if persisted in, have the effect of ruining the country's commerce. This law, designed by Teymourtache in imitation of the Soviet system of state trading, and forced through the Maj- liss without discussion last February, purports to control, under the Govern- ment, by a system of permits and licences, the whole import and export trade of the country. The Persians have not the experience, capacity or organisation to administer successfully such a highly complicated law. Nobody wants it : the officials don’t even profess to understand it. A few merchants who are able to obtain import licences may, for a while, succeed in making profits, but among the public there is growing dissatisfaction. All three measures are the work of Teymourtaehc and have been forced on the country in defiance of the principles of sound finance and economics and contrary to expert advice. The news that the Minister of Court is escorting the twelve year old Crown Prince in Septem ber to Europe is widely interpreted to mean that His Highness will make a pro longed absence abroad. His former popularity is gone although he still enjoys, the unbounded confidence and support of the Shah. It is believed that he is going away to escape the odium of this ill-starred legislation which could the more easily be rescinded in his absence. How far this may be true it is difficult to say, but there can be little doubt that His Highness must now realise that his economic policy has been a failure. 14. And what of the various schemes and enterprises referred to in para graph six above ? In spite of Dr. Lindenblatt’s success in asserting the position of the National Bank against his British rival, it is too early as yet to say that the National Bank has made good. Their overhead expenses are out of ail pro portion to their profits, they have no standing abroad and have yet to gain the confidence of the Persian public, while many of the young foreign educated Per sian employees already are thinking that they know better than the German managers. 15. And the railway, the great trunk line from the Caspian to the Persian Gulf ? s 0 f ar ^ome four million pounds (£4,000,000) has been sunk in this enter prise and in the universal opinion the money might just as usefully have been sunk in one of Ihe seas which the line is so optimistically destined to connect. M hat has actually been constructed is about fifty miles more or less solidly in the North connecting a still non-existent port on the Caspian with a small vil lage near the foot of the pass leading up to the great plateau and in the South far loss solidly some one hundred and fifty miles from a deep water inlet East of the Shatt el Arab where ]io port exists to the town of Dizful just south of the welter Lc549FD57 of limestone mountains that constitute the province of Luristan. ft is not for me to criticise the work of railway engineers but there is little doubt that the Ge rman group in the North, with a greater understanding of Persian psycho logy, have at least produced a roadbed on which a train can travel. There are also imposing stations and iron bridges. The Persians suspect they have been made to pay a prohibitive price—seventy thousand Dollars ($70,000)*a kilometer in the North compared with twenty-four thousand Dollars ($24,OCX)) a kilometer in the South—but at least there is something to show’ for it however useless it in fact may be. In the South, the American group from the first sacrificed quali ty to quantity and they w T ere not favoured by fortune. The Shah visited Oie Southern section in January, 1930. The Americans had certainly laid the lines, but exceptionally heavy’ rain coinciding wdth His Majesty’s visit made it quite impossible to keep the train on the fiimsily built track. The Shah’s coach was derailed, not once hut twice. The Americans were accused of doing the w T ork not merely badly hut expensively, and on May 1st the Persian Government rescinded the contract. The rails have since acquired an even more irrespon sible and serpentine appearance w’hile the rolling stock has greatly deterio rated. The Persians have now engaged at large salaries a Japanese and a Belgian engineer as supervisors, and entrusted the construction w T ork to an American engineer in their employment. The only solid thing in the South is the big iron bridge over the Karun at Ah wax supplied by an English firm and put in place by British riveters. All the other bridges are of wood, the in tention being to replace them later by iron bridges. But the Persians cannot understand this ; the w’ork seemed shoddy and bad to them compared with the German wmrk in the North. The Americans hoped to impress the Shah by the speed with w’hich they had constructed one hundred and fifty miles of line. He was only impressed by the fact that trains appeared unable to run on the line at all. No one can say what will be the outcome. It is estimated that it will cost at least five hundred thousand pounds (£500,000) to put the Southern section in working order, and when this is done there still remains the huge central section of some six hundred miles, the cost of w’hieh has been estimated at not less than thirty million pounds (£30,000,000), if the original alignment of a standard gauge railway is to be maintained. 1 have been told that, of the six imposing German locomotive simported for the Northern section, three are already out of order owing to the inexperience and inefficiency of the young lif engineers w ho w r ere sent to take charge of them, and that tho Belgian engineer has gone home in despair. It almost looks as though Gen- i ai r an -n\ remark wken ra ilwav bill w’as passed may yet come true : i J i railway in five years time will he a few’ rusty rails lore and there. ’ The tragedy of it all is that no one, either Persian or oreign, has oyer had the courage or the honesty to w’arn the Shah of the appa in £_y’ a stage of the country’s limited resources involved in the railway sc em&lt; y I he Geimian and American contractors could hardly be expected to • » so, out the Minister of Court must long since have realised the position, and aye httle doubt that with the disappearance of the Shah the whole thing would be dropped. the Persian Navy it is too early to judge.

It is no exaggeration public anoointm a ^ ew ser d° r Cabinet Ministers, every f is paid tor. A young Deputy actually admitted that hehad paid Teymourtaebe fourteen thousand Tomans (Ts. 14,000) for the oosi- iion. Every Minister abroad pays for the appointment. One and all hope to recoup themselves lor the capital outlay by illegitimate methods, and all those who hav . e luad long experience of this country are agreed that corruption is more universally rife today than at any time within their experience. I may mention, an instance, the following case vouchsafed to me by the Head of Junkers, h dty-Tive thousand Tomans (Ts. 55,000) was voted in last year s budget for upkeep of aerodromes. Exactly one hundred and thirty-two Tomans (Ts. 132) \\as spent, the remainder going into the jackets of various officials Irom the Head oi the Persian Military Air Service downwards. With a view, however, to throwing dust in the eves of the world Fimz Mirza, a notoriously -corrupt Minister, was put on trial'lnst year for malversa tion of public funds. Although convicted on one or two minor charges, the major charge was not proved. The severe sentence he received was°hv the Shah’s orders for political motives. At the same time, it is almost impossible to obtain the payment of debts by Persians, either public or private. There would appear to be an almost entire absence in public life of any moral sense. In business, I am told, the merchant is less unscrupulous. 18. The experience of other advisers and experts appointed by the Persian Government has been similar to that of Doctor Schniewind. The German Forestry expen carefully explored the forest areas of Mazanderan and submit ted reports to which no attention was even paid, and has now been succeeded by a Frenchman. The French public health adviser is apparently content to dra\v T his salary and do nothing, while Monsieur Godard whose main duty as Fine Arts adviser and {ficha'ological expert is to create a national museum found, on his relura after a temporary absence from Tehran, that the financial estimates for his work had simply been cut out from the Budget. He has succeeded in making n collection for the Government of valuable bronzes from Luristan, hut keeps them in locked packing cases for fear that the Minister of Education should take them and sell them for his own profit 1. There is no museum in Persia and Monsieur Godard has not found one single Persian to take the smallest interest in his work of founding one. 19. No foreigner who has lived in Tehran during the past two years has failed to notice the growing anti-foreign tendency which is known to be directly inspired by the Shah. The military have definite, instructions to have no rela tions with the foreign Legations in general and the military Attaches in par ticular. Intercourse of the latter with Persian officers is confined to occasional visits to the Chief of Staff who always professes profound ignorance of every subject mentioned. Provincial Governors now openly warn the people to have as little as possible to do with foreigners, while the list of Persians who may accept invitations to the Legations is strictly checked. Recent reports from Consular Officers state that at the King’s Birthday party this year no Persian official other than the Governor or his deputy was allowed to he present, although in several instances other officials in friendly relations with the Consul private ly apologised for their absence. The only possible explanation of this attitude is the suspicion of the Shah himself with whom suspicion of all and sundry has now become an obsession-—accentuated with every year that he lives. 1 he Minister of Court would appear to encourage this attitude. He has made it practically impossible for any Persian either to approach the Shah directly or to reach His Majesty by the system—time honoured in the East—of written petitions, nor can any of the foreign Representatives now have an opportunity of speaking openly to JHis Majesty as they may no longer bring their own in terpreters. So far as the p&lt;K&gt;ple in general are concerned, I have no reason *o believe that there is any anti-foreign feeling at all, either in Tehran or in the provinces. It is a purely artificial growth and if the mot d’ordre were changed would disappear. 20. Lest you should think that 1 have been attempting to draw an unduly pessimistic picture of Persia today, I would wish the following observations to he considered in conjunction with the foregoing criticisms. 21. The Shah for all his narijow-mindedness, which is largely due to Jack rd education, his avaricious and suspicious nature, is unquestionably a pa nut according to his own light. T would even say the same for Feymourtacho whose devotion to the Shah is undoubted. The underlying motives of both men are, I honestly believe, the regeneration of Persia. The Shah has in ten years built$9 up a military force of some forty thousand men which is incomparably superior to any Persian army of the past even though it cannot yet be classed with any modern army. Security is more or less generally established, communications; by road have been greatly extended, municipal government under the control of the Central Government has been inaugurated in all the principal towns, while a system of justice exists which, however faulty, at least shows some improve ment on the past, 22. The great stumbling block, however, as I see it, to&gt; any serious progress in Persia, as has always been the case in former times, is the Persian ignorance of the elementary principles of finance, an ignorance moreover which, owing to the national characteristics of superficiality, self-satisfaction and arrogance, the Persian will never admit. It is very difficult to understand why the Per sian Government should continually engage, at considerable expense, foreign advisers and then not merely ignore their advice but ahnost invariably do pre cisely what they have been advised not to do. If Persia is heading for national bankruptcy, as would almost appear to be the case, it is entirely her own fault, I have no hesitation in saying that if the Persian overnment were prepared today to engage a first class financial adviser with a select staff under him, give him executive powers, listen to his* advice and then act upon it, there need be no question of bankruptcy or even of a serious economic crisis. But she never will. In addition to the characteristics mentioned, one has to remember the inherent distrustfulness and suspicion of every Persian, not only of every other Persian but of every foreigner in Persian employment. He 'cannot be lieve thaf any man is honest or disinterested. During my first year here when the days of the Millspaugh financial mission were evidently numbered, attempts were made to invent charges of corruption and misappropriation of funds against practically every member of the mission. The Persian hates to think that the foreigner should make money out of him or his country and simply cannot believe that every single foreigner he employs does not try to do so. I consider this ingrained suspiciousness the greatest curse of modern day Per sia. A sparsely populated self supporting agricultural country with few wants should have no difficulty in making ends meet. If Persian finances were honestly administered under careful and stringent control, and wild cat schemes for trunk railways and warships abandoned, Persia would be relatively rich and prosperous. As it is, with no conception! of the elements of sound finance, refusing to listen to or act upon good advice, Persia seems bound to remain a poor and backward country. She has a genius for irritating her neighbours and such ingrained distrust of every 7 other country that she is, and likelv to remain always, as now, without any real friend. 23.

Not one of these gentlemen seems to have had the slightest admin istrative experience, the choice of the last having been dictated by the fact that he has been growing cotton with more than average success in the neighbourhood of Tehran. 3. The three Under Secretaries are already reported to be at daggers drawn owing to that unfortunate question of precedence, and what with the introduction of incompetent friends and relations to take the place of the few officials who knew their job, the confusion in the Ministry is said to be indescribable.

T have the honour to report that the Shah received me in farewell audience on July 2nd- The Minister of Court acted as Interpreter. 2. After the usual complimentary remarks I enquired about the coming visit of the Crown Prince to Europe. His Majesty said that His Royal Highness would go in September with three or four other Persian hoys of about the same a«-e and he intended him to remain there at least three years. He already spoke French fluently and he would now learn English. It was not yet decided vhether he would have his headquarters in Switzerland or in the South of France. As I have already reported Tevmourtache will accompany the Crown Prince to Europe in September. I may add that the Crown Prince, who is twelve years and a half old, already drives a motor car. He is, very properly, not allowed to drive fast but no-one may overtake and pass his car. 3. I then said there was one question which I would like to ask His Majesty if he would permit me. I said that I had noticed with some anxiety in recent months that there appeared to be a growing anti-foreign, if not anti-British, feeling in certain influential circles in Tehran. I would cite two instances I had now received reports from several British consuls in the provinces in which they stated that no officials other than the Governor or tbe Deputy Governor had been allowed to attend their receptions on the King s Birthday on June Srd. Again in Kerman the newly arrived Governor had made a speech in which le stated that it was advisable for the people to have as little to co mi i oreigners as possible. I said I failed to understand the reason or sue i mo me ions. Might I therefore ask His Majesty if he was aware of them The reply pven to me by Teymourtache, as coming from His Majesty, was as follows : His Ma jesty saw no reason for subordinate officials in the provinces to attend he celebrations by foreign consuls of their national days, the Governor would )resent his congratulations and that would be sufficient. Mpiat had u go o , or instance, with the local Judge or the local Head of the Customs ^e order f course did not apply exclusively to British Consulates Rd 0 a , ,, A ^s.regards the speech bv the Governor of Kerman, His Majes y consi er . - n a small and backward town like Kerman there was no object to be gained by he people associating with foreigners a Consid was presunm y •rotect the interests of his compatriots and m his official relations he Mould bviously come in contact with the proper Persian officials, hut there Mas nothing o be gained by extending social intercourse beyond this. C549FD61 4. I made no comment on these remarks as there was nothing to be gained by entering into a discussion of the subject with His Majesty- I thought it better to reserve this for my conversation with the Minister of Court next dav His Majesty then referred to reports which he had received from London in which it was stated that the general feeling towards Persia was not very friendlv I said that T was extremely surprised to hear this and I could assure His Majesty that these reports must be based on a misconception. The feelino- towards Persia had, so far as I am aware, in no way changed. Both my pre decessor and I had repeatedly assured His Majesty that His Majesty’s Govern ment wished for nothing better than to see a strong and united Persia and to entertain the most friendly and cordial relations with her. His Majesty’s Government had given ample evidence of this feeling during the last ten vears The Shah replied that he was very glad to hear me say this as, of course he wished for nothing better than the most cordial relations with Great Britain and that he looked forward before long to the conclusion of the Treaties which had been under discussion, for the past three years. I replied that His Majesty’s Government would be quite ready to resume negotiations for these treaties bat the next word must obviously come from the Persian side. No answer had been received to the communication which had been made as long ago as last February and since my return in the end of March no sign had been given of any desire on Persian side to resume these negotiations. Teymourtache was obviously bewildered as to how to reply to my last remark and said to me that His Majesty was unaware that there had been any further communication on the subject of the Treaty since I left last autumn. At the termination of the audience I begged leave to express my best wishes for the prosperity of Persia and to His Majesty personally and said that I felt certain that it was in the best interests of our two countries to have no misunderstandings and that 1 hoped the clouds which appeared for the moment on the horizon would very quickly he dissipated. His Majesty smiled appreciation of these remarks, wished me bon voyage, and asked to be remembered to Lady Clive. 5. 1 am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.

Office, London, Despatch from Pi. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign No. 369, dated the 15th July 1931. With joferonco to Sir Robert Clive’s despatch No. 286 of June 3rd, enclosing a copy of Tabriz telegram No. 16 of that date on the subject of thi Kurdish campaign m the Ararat zone and its effect on the Perso-Turkish frontier area I have (he honour to transmit to you herewith a copy in translation of a leading article^ m the Iran purporting to record the substance of an interview with the principal J ersian officer on the Perso-Turkish frontier security commis- 2. As you are aware, it is the policy of the Persian Government to suppress all reference m the Persian press to the incidents on that uncomfortable border save an occasional pronouncement to the effect that contrary to all reports in the ioreign press the situation leaves nothing to be desired. The present article is pisl such a pronouncement, and there is no real reason to suppose that Colonel ivazem Ivhan s statements coincide at any point with the true facts of the case, imless it ne m their revelation of the entire Jack of co-operation between the J eisian ana Jurkish forces. Since, however, the “ Iran ” is of a semi-official character, and this article bears clear indications of official inspiration—(it is •' ive to say lliat no Persian officer would dare to state his views on any subject interest ^ CAlU1 ^ e instructions)—the article has perhaps a certain vicarious “• Ararat zone is almost inaccessible to travellers, and the truth about loiuier disputes and incidents is particularly hard to come by. In striking contrast to this inspired statement are the two despatches and the extract from labnz which I enclose herewith. His Majesty’s Consul in that town is separated lorn the scene of operations by a considerable area, and I am prepared to e uwo that there is a large element of exaggeration in the rumours which have eacned him : you will observe that according to one of these the Persian recently sunered no less than eight hundred casualties. At the same time there can fr!\Y !0l1 ^V' u t -^ r - Palmer’s reports come much nearer the truth than the o ucuu version- The latter, indeed, merely illustrates by an indirect process ie complete apathy of Persian public opinion and the extent to which it can be ica m bunkers, T am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the ^ernment of India, to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq, and to Plis -‘-mjesty s Representatives at Constantinople and Tabriz. -Iranslation from the “ Iran ” of 15th Tir, 1310 (10th July 1931). Ifitc/vteiv with Colonel Kazem Khan Sayah, Chief of the Turco-Persian Frontier Security Corn mission. In r ? 0 ^ oliC ^ Kazem Khan has recently arrived in Tehran for a few days' leave : Mew of the various rumours current as to affairs in Azerbaijan we deemed63 it necessary to call upon him and obtain some news on this subject which we append below in the form of question and answer :— Question .—Tn view of the many false rumours spread in Tehran about troubles in Azerbaijan and on the frontier and on account of the stories which are told of the dealings of Turkey and Persia with the Kurds,—although we do not doubt in the least that these stories and rumours are quite untrue, vet as you are the official charged with frontier relations between Persia and one of her neighbours and are in addition Chief of the Frontier Security Commission we wish to obtain from you information which will enable us to get at the truth and if you will give it to us we shall be thankful. Jnswer .—J have just come from Azerbaijan and in the few days that I have been here awaiting orders before 1 return to my post, the number of false rumours concerning Azerbaijan current in Tehran are such that I am astounded at the degree of ignorance of the populace of the capital. I can deny explicitly all these rumours current about Azerbaijan and wall give you all the explanations which you ask for regarding the district of my mission and can repeat that there has been no events taking place there which are worthy of mention. Question.—Cat) you give a short historical sketch of the doings of the Kurds in Ararat and the measures which the Turks have taken to suppress them ? Answer .—My information on this question is what you all know, neverthe less I can briefly repeat that during the last few years a number of Turkish Kurds have been gathered in the Ararat zone and have rebelled against the Turkish Government. During the last few years the Turkish Government have sent forces on several occasions against those gathered on Ararat and were engaged in breaking up the centre of the rebellion and dealing with the rebels- The Persian Government had no direct interest or concern in the annihila tion ot the Ararat Kurds. But no order-loving State can countenance insurrec- tion even in a foreign country ; it is rather in duty-bound to assist in stamping it out Moreover in co-operating with the Turkish Government, in accordance with the policy consistently enjoined on all Persian Government officials in Azerbaijan, whether civil or military, the Imperial Government were actuated by he desiie to see the troubles in the Ararat zone brought to an end in one way 01 another m order that a source of contagion should be removed once for all Especially was this so since this centre of sedition had already engendered disruptive among the more retrogressive Kurdish elements (in Persian en * or &gt; * Baiislatoi) and it was to be feared that it might react unfortunately on the industrious and progressive bulk of the Kurds, whose racial affinity with ‘Gn laman neighbours across the border was resulting in demonstrations of .ynipa n and a desire to co-operate. For all these reasons, then, the Persian ^ T^ e ^ acc eded to the request for assistance made by the rn- lu ^ ' ’^ u . lle 1^30), and when the Turkish armies embarked on their v - paign on ic Turkish slopes of Ararat the Persian army, on their side of the Qu/Iu^ange of hills F ° a&lt; ^ S ° n the Eastern slopes, from Qizii Nish right along the er ’ or ^ er ensure that the Persian Kurds were not induced by \ T ^‘V^^^baihies to come to the assistance of their kinsmen, the troops of nnJ,Ui lVr St °Vi Army 7 ere ^ ven orders to evacuate the whole Perso-Kurdish ‘ i 1( . ,ni zo . lle bordering the frontier in the region of Ararat and send Tnrkiil) i 111 ° - 1 ° 1 ^ erior fhe country. In the meantime some of the of fhA c e0mg l 10 ^ the Per . s:ia11 Government had come to the assistance Shahrivir' wmo . 00 k niaking incursions into Persian territory. In havoc in tho'V * n' ^ -1*130), for example, a band of these men wrought nroccedor will fr b0Urh00d Danalu * Consequently, while the Turkish forces army • . 1 leir 0 P ei ‘ a l lons , three heavy tasks devolved upon the Persian (1) to close the Persian frontier, and thus prevent the insurgents from lai mg retuse on Persian soil or inducing the Persian Kurds to come to their assistance ; (2) to evacuate the Persian Kurds from the frontier zone ; ( ) ^ combat the marauding bands of Turkish Kurds who crossed over into J ersia on raiding expeditions. armv had P^cmdonH second fbese tasks it sometimes happened that the state . ^ ^obedience cm the part of the Kurds, who were k . t excitement and sympathised strongly with their insurgent64 kinsmen, so llint mam force had to be used in order to carrv out the orders issued lor he evacuation of the population. The affair of the Jellali Kurd Klulled Agha will serve as an illustration : this man refused to evacuate ?he frontier zone or cease from helping the Turkish rebels who had made the r base in the plain of banalu. A fight with the Persian forces ensued, and being routed he (led wi h h,s Turkish followers across the border into Turkish territorv I am sorry to have to record that m spite of the fact that the Persian operations against this man had been solely in the interest of general security and to he advantage of the Turks, the Turkish commander-in-chief received this man a d ns band (consisting of some twenty families) at Buralan, and allowed them o take reluge with him. ’ u LO Nevertheless the Persian forces fought shoulder to shoulder with the Turks on the slopes of the Quzlu and Aiyi Beg and continued to co-operate in f„n measures till the end ot the Ararat campaign. This co-operation resulted in the final success or Ihe Purkish commanders, and Ararat was eventually cleared of rebels, the insurgents scattering in all directions. Question.—-Do you imagine that the troubles in the Ararat area are definitely over and that Ihe success which has crowned the forces of the two countries is permanent m its effects 1 Answer. If the plans which we now have in view are carried out to the full the Ararat troubles may be taken as definitely at an end, by our present plans 1 mean various important factors which I shall pretend to enumerate as follows : - (1) The Turkish Government has decided to keep the Ararat area per manently uninhabited. No Kurdish tribes will be permitted to live there, so that the area will cease to serve as the refuge of the retrogressive elements in the Kurdish population. (~) In theii trim, as I have already explained, the Persian Government have cleared the frontier area of its former inhabitants and have sent these into the interior. (3) The views of the two Governments in regard to the measures to be taken to prevent a recurrence of these troubles are identical, and in view of the extent of the co-operation which has so far been achieved and the energy deployed on both sides of the frontier by the forces and officials concerned there is no reason to imagine that such troubles will break out again. (4) The Turkish Government, with a view to establishing their control over the two Ararats, have suggested to the Persian Government that an exchange of territory should take place in that area ; their object, as I have been informed, is that they should acquire posses sion of a road which has hitherto been in Persian territory and leads up to Ararat, crossing the Quzlu valley, to a depth of about six or seven kilometres from the frontier, the Persian Government receiving compensation in the shape of land elsewhere. The latter, in pursuance of their policy of co-operation, and with a view to assisting the Turkish Government, have accepted in principle Ihe exchange proposed, subject however to agreement being reached as to the exact zones to be transferred, and in order that pending a final settlement the necessary intercourse may be established the road in question is already under the dual control of the two forces. It is evident that the Persian Government’s consent to such an arrangement 'vill only become definitive when no further co-operation is expected of us beyond the maintenance of security which has been mentioned as the objective of the operations in question ; the final acquisition of the road leading up to Ararat is dependent on the Persian Government receiving adequate compensation else where ; failing that it is improbable that she will consent to part with the road ‘Uid the heights which from a military point of view are needed if the road is to he protected against attack. Quesiion .—IVe have heard in Tehran that after the disorders on Ararat had been brought to an end, a number of insurgents from that area fled to Persia an d pillaged the countryside. Can you furnish any explanations with regard to Lco49FD65 this point, describing at the same time the steps taken by each of the two o- 0 T ments interested in putting down the Ararat insurrection ! to&lt; Vcrn ' Answer .—As regards the situation of the Ararat rebels after the coiwl • of the fighting in that area l can give the following particulars Yon i * USl01 ] course that after the campaign came to an end and the rebels dispersed W 0t heir leaders surrendered to the Persian forces and avp m \ ,sc ! me [use mat alter me campaign came to an end and the rebels dispersed of their leaders surrendered to the Persian forces and are at the preset residing in Persia under the surveillance of the authorities.

Negotiations for submission and disarmament were still going on with other leaders—as reported in my last summary. • Then suddenly late on May 24th, there was a rumour of a Persian disaster, am it later transpired that there had been a surprise attack made (some time &lt; I* 1 Vi Nuids chased across the frontier by Turkish soldiers. I must here state that a most vigorous censorship was at once semi-officiafly announced, ^ 1J ] 1 m r,a c^hi’t-martial was threatened for anyone who divulged news, and officers particularly warned not to do so. w ^ appear that these Kurds from Turkey attacked a Persian camp n i n anc * Maku at night ; and In this and subsequent fighting killed 124 men and wounded 200 or 3D0 more. , , vf 0 ° lst T abriz Tib were sent off with Sarhang Kalb-Ali Khan »n i av st to 5th ; and 3 aeroplanes arrived on Mav 25th and flew on towards Maku on May 26th. i i- ^ b ° 7 10 ^further fighting on their arrival, but no accurate news could he obtained.

T am also told that troops rrom Gurdistan (not the garrisons from Ushnu etc.) are being transferred via Sanj-Bulak and Urumia towards Maku. The Persians also appear to have armed the loyal Maku Kurds, and in fact 3 of the Maku chiefs are reported to have been killed while fighting for the Persians. A cousin of the former C. in C. here (Zafar Dauleh) who was acting as Liaison with one of the Maku Khans is reported to have been captured by the Kurds. Yavar Gavidil (mentioned in my last summary) the Commandant of Maku has died of wounds, and Nayib Sarhang Hussein Khan of the Supahban Tabriz Regiment has been wounded in the arm (not seriously as previously re ported). Confidential .—Discontent with the new General Mohtashami is expressed by the Officers. One definite complaint is that he evacuated a particular hill, which was at once occupied by the rebels. 'Whatever be the truth in the above rumour, there is no doubt that the Corps of Officers are dissatisfied both with his military capacity and with him personally and would eagerly welcome the return of Zafar Dauleh. They unite in feeling that had he been here the present disaster would never have been allowed to occur. This Consulate has been able to glean a little information of a general nature from a Captain whose name it would be unfair to him to put in a report which must be transmitted by the Persian post. He did not consider the posi tion to be really critical, and said that there was no real need of troops from Tehran. He, however, confirmed that three big lorries with ammunition, 3 Offi cers and 8 men reached Tabriz from Tehran last week ; and also that about 400 of the Maku and Avajuk local residents and villagers had been armed as well as some of the loyal Maku Kurds. On the morning of June 3rd I was shown a translation of a telegram from the General at Maku to the Civilian Governor General here :—I then despatched my own telegraphic summary in ordinary code—Tel. 16 of June 3rd. The General’s telegram was published as a special supplement of some numbers of the local papers and ran as follows :— “ Rebel Kurds at Ararat, who had fled at the beginning of Spring after losing many people and abandoning all their sheep and animals, had concentrated at Elkhigan and Galajug, where some other rebel Kurds had joined them. Although their families had been made prisoners bv the military at the beginning of spring, they them selves still refused to deliver up their arms and return to Persia. For that reason on the 28th of Ordibehesht (May 19th) the force at Maku, under Sarhang Mohamed Ali Khan, commander of the Second Tib, left to punish them. During the night of 29th Ordi behesht (May 20th) they met the rebels at Gishlag Esa Khan and Husushki and fighting began and lasted for 8 days and nights. Although the rebels aided by their naturally strong positions which they had also fortified, resisted courageously they were at last driven out of their strong positions at Gishlag Esa Khan one after another, and driven back to their last positions of Elkigan and Gal a jug which are both very strong positions. They had fuitnei fortified these and hence they opposed further resistance, but orders were given to attack the rebel centie on these heights and at 5 a.m. on the 5th of Khurdad (May 27th) the troops attacked, drove the enemy from their trenches bv 8-30 and at 11 am they had occupied all the heights and had followed the enemy 3 farsakhs (about 12 miles) towards Kiralar. The rebels Lc549FDwere dismayed and abandoned all their animals, sheep, tents anl food. The aeroplanes could later see no signs of the Kurds in a™ part of Kiralar. ” ^ Notes .—This telegram is not at all clear in places, nor do I know if it viu have been published at Tehran. 1. By “ return to Persia ” followed by orders to “ punish them ” and the use of the name Kiralar later, it would sound as if the Persians had actually gone and attacked these Kurds in Turkish territory. y The Turkish Consul General denies this, and his son has apparently Wn saying that the Turks are inside Persian territory. J Kirralar is a large zone where the hill-sides are often honevcombed with cares. I understand that part of this zone is in Persia and part in Turkey. I presume V return to Persia ” must be read to mean “ to that nart n f Persia whither it was intended to transplant them ”. ' P ‘ The most likely explanation would seem to be that the Turks threats, nr, attack from the other side and that the Kurds took up a position in Persian tcinton where they ambushed Sarhang Mohamed Ali Khan’s column • fnr ‘ho Commandant of Maku-Gavidil-was wounded at m^t and^ed n^t dav .Maku)! r0ra 3 ° r , ' gram aSkin S about the dis P° sal ^ his equipment at As regards the later stages of the fichtino- t] lp n “ th 2 n ^ s were going better ”, while T overheard him con^f to ! d me Staff whom he had not seen previously, but I also noticed ^ 16 was very luke-warm and the recipient looked evce^iv^) til . e l con g ra elation had admitted that things had no-one torwell at first 7 P1Sh * He I ropoi teti the occupation of Gishlag some weeks furn nnrt +v.* ed at the time as an action which would crionle ihn th - 1S was re gard- had to be recaptured with severe fighUng onMav 97t^ff reS1 f^ As it that this is the Hill, the evacuation of which hv thn'r**' ’ // w °old seem clear adverse comment among his own officer^ I TnJv J/T? l \° rdeTs had caused ^^‘e^herras mLnkig ^Mhfm 116 i n the K^ar zone probably entrenched in the caves whence it Jin i, ? 1 ” , bodv . has escaped and is ner the General evacuated Gishlag in order beliardto dislodge them.

Overseas Irade (13.)-115, dated the 30th June 1931. With reference to my despatch No. Overseas Trade (B)-86 of July Wth last (Enclosure of Serial No. 81 in File No. 21-N.|30), I have the honour'to inrorm you that I have lately obtained the Customs estimate, based on telegra- re P°rt s &gt; of the import and export trade during the year ended March list mdl. This offers a useful comparison with the figures finally recorded in res^ pect of the previous year—see table attached. 2. Unfortunately no separate figures are available for the imports of bullion one specie. These, however, only amounted to 42.4 million krans in 1929-30 and cannot therefore account for any appreciable part of the reduction in im ports, which marked the year 1930-31. This should of course be ascribed to* the (.earth of exchange^ and the fall in the purchasing power of the population resulting from the continued slump in the price of silver during the last Persian year. 3. It will be noted that there was a general fall in the kran values of all imports and exports in 1930-31, whereas the year before (see my despatch under rercrenee) there was an actual increase in the kran values of both imports and exports other than oil, although there was a reduction in their sterling values. 4. The exports of oil no longer help to finance imports, now that the Govern- iiient not only credit the oil royalty to their gold reserve but also monopolise , 10 whole of the exchange sold by the Anglo Persian Oil Company to meet its ^cal requirements which exchange has been very largely spent on arms and ammunition which do not figure in the Customs statistics. ,J - Exduding the oil exports, the adverse balance of trade was reduced from 1° 327 million krans (£7.4 to £5.2 million). Apart from the reduction in imports noted above, this was due to the artificial stimulus to the export trade llc h was one of the features of the exchange crisis. The greater volume of * n °^ ler WOI&gt; Js helped to offset the fall in the sale value of Persian, like other, products on the world’s markets.71 6.

His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreion Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of Despatch to the Foreign Office, No. 410, July 30th, 1931 on the subject of language of correspondence between Consular officers and Persian officials. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 410, dated the *30th July UJl. With reference to Sir Robert Clive’s despatch No. 328 of June 25th regarding the language of correspondence between British Consular officers and local Persian officials, I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of the reply which I have now received to the note which formed the second enclosure in that despatch. 2 Feroughi’s attitude will be seen to be uncompromising, and the solution which he proposes, namely that the correspondence of the Residency and Con sulate-General should be conducted through the channel of this Legation and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, is of course no solution at all. His case appears to me logical!? almost unassailable, and before returning any rop y I shall await the instructions for which Sir R. Clive asked in his despatch under reference. 3 There is one point arising out of this correspondence which has not so far been considered : the Persian language is a quite esceptionalh poor mediu of ordinary thought for all its legacy of past literary splendour It has yet to lie adapted adequately to the needs of modern life, and the translations official notes made by the moonshees of this Legation mto their owri anguage are productive of numerous ambiguities and misunderstandings some of are for linguistic reasons practically unavoidable. Ferougis knowledge o, English is by no means perfect, but it has been noticed that when show a of a note from the Legation he invariably reads the English text »n Preference to the Persian translation. That is a point which cannot of course, be made use of in discussing the question, but it is perhaps worth bearing in mmd_ determining the degree of resistance which should be shown to the rersia. demands. 3.

His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of Despatch to the Foreign Office, No. 413, dated 31st July 1931, on the subject of Law for the punishment of officials of the Justice Department failing to execute their proper functions. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 413, dated the 31st July 1931. 1 have the honour to transmit to you herewith in translation the text of a law which has been submitted to the Mejlis Judicial Commission regarding the scale of punishment contemplated for those officials of the Department oi Justice who for personal, private or other motives fail to dispense justice im partially in the cases with which they arc called upon to deal. 2 Of the various cases of failure to obtain justice which of late years have come to the notice of this Legation, the most notable is the suit arising out of the assault on the Consular Clerk at Ahwaz (see feir R. Clive s despatch No- 338 of the 27th June, 1931). The savage flogging of a British Indian subject at Chahbar bv order of a military officer comes within the scope of a military tribunal in so far as disciplinary action ^mred^ but ;t wm.ld nresnmahlv be the duty of the Public Prosecutor of the Civil Cpuii Iomiq!le P int'“he request o? a-civilian for redress and compensation against a military officer, especially when the latter, as the I email Goveram n ^ case admitted, was acting outside the scope of ^ ls ,' u , 1 “ al y !| ut urf , dared {o which has come to the notice of this Legation have the civil P^dare^to intervene where a soldier (officer or man) was co mthin the competence where there were aspects of the case which brought it within the compete of the civil courts. . , , . „ i 3.

A British firm happenea75 to the expense of sending a lawyer by air from Tehran to take charo-e •+ interests The matter was taken np by His Majesty’s Legation but representations have so far been without result. ’ 5. It has not come to the notice ol this Legation that the courts of Tn«ti^n are more corrupt than other administrations ; they are certainly less oo rr w than the Mildary ; the most luxurious houses in Tehran are almost all owi?, by officers ot the Army. During the last two or three years mixed commisS composed of officials drawn from the various departments of State have sent round the country to inspect provincial departments, the president of tb! Commission usually being a general or a military officer of high rank • commissions claim to have brought to book a number of corrupt officials hnf they have in general acted with so little regard for the laws of the country’ and with so little ordinary tact that the result in many instances has been a comnleto disorganisation of the provincial administration concerned. Mirza Hass™ Khan Mushar resigned his post as Minister of Finance last year lar-elV bo cause his administration both in Kerman and Yezd had been completely dis' organised by one of these commissions, which had put under arrest the Greater part of the staff. As a rdsult, the Minister could find nobodv willing to go I here A commission which recently visited Bushire enquired into complaints of bribery made against Monsieur Wolters, the Belgian in charge of the Customs, m connection with a transaction in opium. This official was obliged to resign his post and leave the country, although Monsieur Dekerekheer the Administrator-General of Customs, informs me that the complaint was quite unfounded, as his subordinate had acted on authority given to him from Tehran. (It is perhaps only fair to add that in this particular case the commission did better than they knew, for Monsieur Wolters was undoubtedly corrupt and had been for long a thorn in the flesh of His Majesty’s Consulate-General). Other Belgians who had been formerly in the South were also brought under suspicion, and it seems likely that the Persian Government will avail themselves o this tact (even where the evidence is negative) to replace them with other elgian officials whom it is hoped to engage on a lower scale of pay. _ 5 ' 11 w™!d I fear, be a mistake to take this ostensible attempt to stamp out corruption at its face value ; there is one law for those in high places and another for the common herd of petty officials ; one law for those in the pro- unces and another for those m Tehran. Corruption is merely being centralised for the benefit of a more restricted and more shamelessly venal few.

BRITISH LEGATION. Tehran. 13th July, 1931. Confidential letter from His Majesty’s Consul, Tabriz, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 56, dated the 29th June 1931. I have the honour to report that I duly visited the greater part of the Persian section of the Rawanduz Route : and considered that the whole had been well conceived and executed. Starting from the jetty at Haidarabad in the extreme S. W. corner of Lake Urumiah a chaussfie runs past Nagadeh to a Customs House at Khaneh and then a few kilometres further to the frontier at Ray at. A total of 83 kilometres. 2. ^Tlie heavy rains have much delayed construction work this year, and getting near the Livan Chai (at kilometre 62) from Hbidarabad, the road was temporarily broken from kilometre 57j for a distance of 5# kilometres and we had to take to a very rough track across Gelds which ended at the Livart Chiu bridge at kilometre 62. This bridge is not yet finished and we had to let the cai cross empty and walk over ourselves. Beyond the bridge and between it and the Customs House at Khaneh H)74l the chaussee has 2 other short breaks in it at kilometres 63 and 67. The breaks at kilometres 57} and 67 are marked by big stones across the track, as the second at least is dangerous.3. At Khaneh there is a customs and military post of 35 mfen under a o n( ] Lieutenant. 15 more men are at a forward post close up to the front 'er This officer proved obstructive, and at first did not wmt to lot „ further at all without telephoning for orders to Sauj-Bulak ! He t“en hinted that my luggage strapped on the car possibly contained contraband ; and lid not want me to approach the frontier unless I unstrapped it all and left it at Khaneh. Finally he agreed to let me retain my luggage and proceed, but only frontier ° ne 8 8 ° IdierS “ the Car aiul (lid «&lt;&gt;t cross the • t tt: , pl ;? V ? d r T 1 ^ 8 to protest t0 thi6 officer that it to the Persian interest that I should see exactly what had been done in construction work that I had a special recommendation from the Director of the Road Department tor Azerbaidjan, for this ranker officer had no respect for the Road Depart- ment or anyone or anything except his Superior Officer at Saui-Bnlak and his orders. 4. I, therefore, only went On as far as the crfcst of the last pace, whence a sharp descent led to a small plain with the village of Ha vat nestling behind a small hill at the further side of this plain. 5. From Khaneh the only real steep asfeent in the Persians secfion starts ; and it is a very impressive onfc indeed. At the crest a walk of about 10 yards enables one to command uninterrupted views up to the Iraq frontier and back over the plain of the Livan Chai. 6. The descent towards the Iraq side is much more gradual than that on ih the Persian, and there are only 5 acute hair-pin turns ; but on the Persian side there are 14 single hair-pins and one double hair-pin while the road climbs about 450 metres in this short stretch of 7,2f)0 metres. 7. The curves are wide, however, and well banked ; excepting one stretch of about 600 yards crossed by a small stream in the bend of a narrow curve. This will now be widened and a bridge will be built across this rivulet. 8. This section and the bridge over the Divan Chai shohld be terminated by this autumn. As said above the exceptional rainfall this vear has delayed work considerably. 9. The final stretch up to the frontier, consisting of the last 2 kilometres unmade and 600 yards before that only half made, is being purposely left unfinished in order to fix the exact point of junction of the Iraq and Persian sections in consultation with the Iraq Road Engineers. 10. I spent one night at the Road Department’s mud Hut at Nagadeh, where the Deputy Chief of the Rawanduz Road Section and the Haidarabad Harbour-Master also spent the night and we had long discussions. 11. Here I saw the new sign-boards prepared for Haidarabad Pori, which ran :— To Iraq Frontier .. .. 83 kilometres. To Sauj-Bulak .. 57 kilometres. To Urumiah .. • 65 kilometres. My car’s speedometer (in Kilometres) was well in agreement y.ith the above, and with the sectional plati of the Rawanduz road shown me m His iti . 32. The general idea is that either :— (a) Goods should use the railway from Tabriz to Sliarafkhaneh and the steamer from there to Haidarabad ; and vice versa, andjor (b) Goods should use lorries from Tabriz to Danalu, and steamer from there to Haidarabad ; and vice versa. At present the road to Sharafhfeafteh is terrible West of Sofian ; and that to Danalu is very bad much of the way. Route (a). Has several objections ; ^ There are at present only 2 trains a week from 20 minutes : but these are at P^f' nt .\ n,c 'n^ steamer »es on to Haidarabad for Urumiah (Port of Golmankhaneh). ^ tlje stw tch Sharaf- ^rom TTrumiai (Oohuankhaneh) to Haidarabad by this steamer is 6 hours,Route (b). There is only one steamer a week from Danalu to Haidarabad but this takes 6 hours only. Tabriz to Danalu should be possible by car next year in 3 hours. It now needs 5 hours. Lake Steamers.—These are merely small tugs, and passengers and mer chandise are embarked on large barges one or more of which is towed behind They have holds and “ cabins ” of a sort. From Golmankhaneh to Urumiah there is a good road, mostly chaussee and the run of 12 miles takes only about half an hour in fine weather. It will thus be seen that once a week goods could be sent to and from Iraq via Haidarabad both by Sharafkhaneh and by Danalu. The first route would collect the produce of Urumiah Salmas, Khoi and Maku and the second that of Maragha, Mianduab, Sauj-Bulak, Uahnu ; and either could collect that of Ardabil and the Mughan. On the first route the steamers also touch at Ag Cunbad a port of the Shahi promontory, but I could see no local produce or purchasing power there sufficient to interest Iraq or Great Britain in this call. 13. At Urumiah itself hopes are entertained of concentrating all the eventual Rawanduz Traffic upon this town, and the Sharafkhaneh route.- It is true that the surplus produce of Khoi (cereals) ; of Salmas (cereals and tobacco) ; and of Maku wool, cotton and cereals would naturally come through Urumiah in any case and for certain commodities from these districts and from the Urumiah district itself the Urumiah-Galmankhaneh road and steamer to Haidarabad might be a good route in the present poor state of the Urumia- Haidarabad road. I cannot, however, at present see any advantage in this route for Tabriz and beyond. It entails the use of the railway Tabriz-Sharafkhaneh, and the at present slow and round-about steamer services to Haidarabad. The combination of lorry to Davalu and steamer from there would there fore seem preferable under present conditions. 14. It is, however, clear to me that there are two camps :— The Urumiah one which desires to utilise the railway and the steamer, service at all costs ; and the Road Department one, which desires to improve the main roads and dispense with the transhipments called for if the aid of the steamer and railway services is to be invoked. I confess that I feel the latter to be the right idea ; as one would not be tied down to a weekly service, and such things at A. P. 0. G. or Mosul Kerosene and Benzin could be put on a lorry and run without transhipment straight to their Persian destinations—as the Russians now do with their oils from Julfa. I foresee also a market in Iraq for fresh fruit such as grapes and apricots fiom Lrumiah and Maragha ; and a mere weekly service with the further lough handling caused by extra transhipments would probably prevent the success of any such trade. 15. The Jetties at the Lake ports are rather ramshackle wooden affairs langmg m length from 320 yards at Haidarabad and 220 yards at Golmankhaneh io over 600 yards at Sharafkhaneh. I have not seen that at Danalu. These piers have been twice increased in length lake-wards in the last 3 years by long additions ;—each addition being at a lower level of some 6 or 8 bidder 11 ^ recec ^ n ^ sec tlon, and reached by an inclined plane or even by a /Editions at lower levels have been necessitated by the rapid shrink age of the Lake in 1927-28 and again last year. year's abnormal rainfall the Lake level had, however, risen again 2J inches this year up to June 10th, and is still steadily rising. Rails vith hand-propelled trucks are installed upon the original shore- uau sections only, and porterage by hand must again be used upon the ongei and much narrower two new Lakeward sections. Embarking and mem aiking of both merchandise and passengers is a difficult business in wmter weather. When approaching a port the towed barge or barges are cas o and leach the pier-heads partly by acquired impetus and partly by the use of long punting-poles. 7 on ir&gt; ‘ A «i llC .^ air,er Ieaves Golmankhaneh for Sharafkhaneh on Tuesdays at a m. I decided to leave Urmia the afternoon before in order to have leisure to make my road-notes, etc.1 fouml tliat there was still no sort of accommodation at Golmankhaneh and we sle.pt on board the barge alongside the pier-a most uncomfortable arrangement which I should not advise others to imitate. miortaDie • fr ' ln started long after we were able to get away , r ?

Makn, via Khoi and Salmas to Urnmiah. B. Tabriz via Julfa and Khoi and Salmas to Urnmiah. C. Tabriz via Khoi (direct) and Salmas to Urumiah. As regards A and B. I have so far only traversed the Salmas-Unimiah section ; and the small portion of the Julfa-Tabriz chaussee between Sofian and Tabriz. The usual route to Urumiah from Tabriz (excepting the Lake and Rail way route described above) is B. There is an excellent chaussee from Tabriz to Julia and a very good chaussee from Julfa to Khoi. I believe the section Khoi-Salmas is not nearly so good. The section Salmas-Urumiah needs repair upon parts of it : and it includes the long Gushghi pass rising to 6,000 feet with continual curves and bends. J liese are not nearly broad enough and are not all of the same width and while the grading and banking is good and the surface has been newly repaired on the Salmas side only, no repairs have been made on the Urumiah side and there are often deep ruts on this side—sometimes right in the centre of the curves. In its present state this pass would be dangerous when covered by snow which would both mask the ruts of the surface and might form cornices con cealing the edges of the narrow and varying track. C. I am told the direct Khoi route is execrable ; but I propose to see this on my second tour. D. Unimiah to Haidarabad. This is a very had road in parts, and at one part there is an extensive swamp which it would be difficult to cross soon after heavy rain or when snow w'as melting. E. Tabriz to Mianduap-Saujbulak and Haidarabad. A detailed report on this road will follow, while Mr. Vice-Consul Summerhayes has already reported upon it as far as Mianduab. The road calls for extensive repairs : as it is badly rutted and there are mudholes. I turned off it and stayed one night at Maragha ; the by-pass road to which is very good and mostly chaussee. The small by-pass from this road to the port of Danalu has been re surfaced recently and is also in good condition. There is one bad steep descent nearing Sauj-Bulak w T ith narrow and sharp hairpins calling for the use of both hand and foot brakes. I doubt if a long wheel-based lorry could negotiate this easily : but it is short and could easily be improved. Note. —There is now no practicable road closer to the southern margin of the Lake than D. Much of the land shown on the maps in this quarter is really salt marsh or mud flats. F. Ushbu to Nagadeh. I did this the day after a heavy hail and rain storm of 2£ hours following on nearly a week’s fine weather. The car stuck twice in mud having once to be helped out. The plain near Ushbu is inclined to be swampy anyhow, and is traversed by numerous irrigation channels. I turned back at a particularly deep channel 2 miles E. of Ushnu ; as I had in any case decided not to enter Ushnu itself for political reasons. G. and H. The feeders of Tabriz itself : G. from Ahar. H. from Astara via Ardabil. They are both bad and almost impossible in winter. Lc549FD81 20. On my return here I called upon the Director of Roads, and he dec lared that he did not believe he would attempt a road close around the south shore of the Lake, but would endeavour to improve the existing Mianduab Sauj Bulak-Haidarabad Sections. This, however, with the small credits available, could not be begun till next year and might take two years to complete.’ This vear he would improve the Tabriz-Maraghah sections ; and also the Urumiah side of the Salmas-Urumiah road. He would also hope to do some work this year or next upon the Urumiah- Haidarabad section. But I gathered that it might be three years or even more before the whole network Tabriz-Maragha-Sauj Bulak-Haidarabad and Khoi-Salmas-Urumiah- Haidarabad could be placed upon a sound all-weather basis. 21. A rest house is contemplated at Nagadeh, which, though at present a miserable looking village of mud huts, is in the centre of the fertile Sulduz district—whereas Haidarabad consists of solely the Harbour Master’s house and a depot and has no water-supply. There are no villages very near it either. I was assured that there is little Malaria in the Sulduz, hut confess X doubt this as there are abundant irrigation channels and the land is inclined to be swampy and rice is cultivated there. In fact the district must have been a mere mud-bath during all this spring ; to judge by its condition following on the 2^ hours storm mentioned above. 22. To come to the question of the economic future of the Rawanduz Route. A. Imports into Persia .—During last year some experiments were made in sending up Kerosene and Benzine from Mosul to Nagadeh, (300 camel loads). Sauj-Bulak and Urumiah. On camels this took 13 days from Mosul to Nagadeh. The experiment was popular and I was asked at various places why these despatches had not been continued. The reply was that freight had proved too costly. As T felt that the Russian distribution system would be most instructive, I have taken pains to ascertain it and some of the prices ruling at mid-June. Main distributing centre : Julfa. Prices at mid June. Benzine. Kerosene, Sent from there to Tabriz by Railway Prices at Tabriz .. .. ,. 26 Tabriz redistribution by Lorry to Maragha Prices at Maragha .. .. .. 28 Mianduab, receives by camel from Sauj-Bulak, or Maraghah. 15.90 17.• Urumiah.

There is no official organisation there ; and only a dealer who is not always in residence. . 30 15.90 Prices as at Urumiah. Prices not known to me, but presumably the same as at Nagadeh. .32 16 30 15.80 Nagadeh, by camel from Sauj-Bulak Sauj-Bulak by camel direct from Julfa It will thus he seen that Tabriz supplies Maragha by lorries, while Julf&lt; supplies Urumiah and Sauj-Bulak direct by camels and not lorries. And tha tor subsidiary distributions from Urumia and Sauj-Bulak camels only are usee ,i T 11 , 6 f r ®i£ht rates are said to be cheaper by camel, and my comments o xne state ot roads will show why and also show that some of the “ roads ” ar a present only feasible for lorries during a few months of the year.the same JZ’oih^ of Rnssi “ ^ar may be said to be exactly and WSZ d « B » B '“'»“&gt;*»«»&gt; i*^ s s At Nasadeh there was only a “ visiting ” vendor with small stocks ; and I presume this will be the case at Ushnu as at Mianduab. vinciaMo^s add her6 that ther&lt;! 31-6 com P arativel y few cars based on pro- Mar a glia. Has 2 public cars ; 2 private cars 11 garages Sa(iij-r*ulah.*—No cars or lorries. 1 “ garage Urumiah .—There are generally 5 or 6 cars and 5 in the 3 garages. ; no lorries ; and 3 or 6 lorries at disposal There are 3 or 4 garages. Actually I hired for 40 krans the private owner-driven car of the son of the Governor of the Sulduz to drive me to Irolmaiikhaneh as the cars available in the garages had no speedometer ! My chauffeur from Tabriz to Urumiah said that he could do with his new Ford about 100 kilometres (621 miles) per 4 gallon tin of Benzine upon the la inz Julfa chaussee and similar roads ; but that upon bad roads such as the ilai ag.ta-Mianduab-Sauj-Bulak, and Haidarabad-Urumiah sections iie averaged about 32 kilometres (20 miles) to a tin : and still less on the Sharaf- khaneh-Sonan stretch. rnel t\\o cars, and 3 or 4 lorries used partly to convey passengers on the 1 abiiz-Maragha, and Sofian-dabriz sections, and one car between I rumiah and Haidarabad. Our car was the first this year to try the Ushnu road. In other words the use of a car is rare between Maragha and Urumiah, though more frequent in the northern half of Azerbaidjan. Practically speaking the new Ford is the best-indicated for the bad roads, sharp turns and gradients, and narrow manoeuvring space. Our car—a new Ford—had already run over 41,000 kilometres (25,000 miles) and we had not the slightest trouble with it (not even a puncture) and we sailed up the Fawanduz climb ol 7,200 metres (71 miles) at a gradient of 1 : 16 in exactly 15 minutes ! In estimating the possibility of competition in kerosene, etc., it must be remembered-that the Russians are always prepared to make sacrifices in order to retain their grip of a market. A recent instance was quoted to me while 1 was on this tour where the Russians had paid 16 krans a pud freight to Hamadan for their sugar and yet sold this at Hamadan for 65 krans a pud when the price was round about 78 krans at Tabriz ! In the face of competition one would expect to see the Russians drop their prices at all of their distributing centres near the Rawanduz Route. Bitumen .—The Director of Roads gave me confidentially to understand that he would like to try crude Bituminous products from Mosul on parts of his roads, while prepared Asphalt would be too expensive. Other Imports .—The total value of Imports from Great Britain into Azerbaidjan by all routes was only a little over one million krans in both 1930-31 and 1929-30 : but presumably this volume might be increased both in quantity of goods actually established on the market and by the addition of new ranges which cannot transit Russia and which the delays of the Trebizond route discourage Importers to order. British India imported just under eight million krans (chiefly tea) in 1930-31 nnd nearly twelve million krans the year before. I visited thoroughly the Bazaars of Maragha, Sauj-Bulak and Urumiah and found them very poor indeed. There was no display of gold ornaments in the dwellers’ booths, no large stocks of carnets or other valuable native manufactures, no sign of any native Industries. 'Without very substantial advances in native purchasing power and Standard of Living there seemed no held anvwhere for British manufactured articles, but mostly for cheap con tinental articles.83 B. Exports .—It is from the encouragement to and opportunity offered for the export of native agricultural produce and I expect the main initial success of the Rawanduz Route. Marafjha is centre of a district of 300 villages, all irrigated by a network of miniature canals from the Sofi river ; which district paid 420,000 tomans in taxes last year. Cereal s and of course grapes and raisins are the chief pro ducts but some cotton is produced and this latter and cereals could be increased. The Mianduab district grows much cotton, though this year the crops wefe entirely destroyed by hail on June 2nd. There are also quantities of raisins and cereals. The Sauj-Bulak plain grows tobacco, as also do its dependent districts of Mangour, Mamish and Lahijan. A little wool also comes from the tobacco districts. Nagadeh, Rahdana and the Sulduz district produce rice, tobacco, and cereals. The Ushnu valley produces tobacco, wool and cereals. I feel sure rice could be grown here also. Ur umiak. —Has 4 main districts producing raisins. Last year 300 waggon-loads were produced and all except 7 have been sold. Note. —A waggon-load is estimated at from 700—900 puds according to the form of packing and degree of compression of the raisins. This year f of the crops were destroyed by hail early in June, which broke the tendrils. Almonds in quantities and some rice is grown. An experiment wdth 200 puds of cotton seeds is being made this year. The Russians sold 100 puds of this at 3 krans per poud on condition that the crop be resold to Russia at one kran below the market rate. Tobacco is grown around Urumiah itself and in the Targaver and Margaver districts. Wool is also produced in large quantities in the same districts as the tobacco and also at Dasht. Salmas .—Tobacco and cereals ; and wool from Somai and Bradost. Khoi chiefly produces cereals. Maku chiefly produces cotton and wool. Tabriz produces Almonds at Dehkhargan and the Sharafkhaneh district. Sharafkhaneh—Almonds and cotton in the Gunei district.

He chose this moment to impose an additional tax of 1 kran a pud on raisins and maintained this tax until all except 7 waggon-loads ot raisins had been sold, despite a telegram of protest to Teheran and a reply from the l runnah deputy that this tax was irregular. Each transaction still entails the payment of a Municipal Tax ot 4 shahis per pud by both vendor and purchaser. Similar the Tobacco Monopoly has increased the tobacco tax from 8 krans per sagat batman to 12 ; with the result that less tobacco is being planted at l rumiah and elsewhere this year than usually. At I rumiah this Governor said to me that the peasants where unwilling to plant the usual second seasonal crops—“ as they said that they could find no market for them ”. T had, however, noticed many newly rdotighed fields from Maragha to Sauj- Bulak, and I naturally wondered if lack of a ready market or fear of new arbitrary impositions were the real cause of this apparent apathy at Untmiah. While this particular individual has such dual autocratic powers in l muriah, it might be regrettable that Urumiah be made the centre of the Rawan- duz Route traffic. The clear decrease of population in recent years is very ’ marked. The reasons would seem to be :— (a) The ravages of ivar and their consequences .—Urumiah and its district was sacked in 1918-19 first by the Assyrians and Armenian Levies ; then by the i urks. The native moslems seized this opportunity to pillage and even niassaere the resident Christians. The Catholic and Russian Missions were completely destroyed as well as most of the Christian suburbs of Urumiah and the present central nucleus of the town is still surrounded by 4he remains of devastated Christian suburbs. Every possible obstructionist method to prevent the return of Christians to Urumiah is adopted by the present Governor. Their title-Deeds are dec lared to be out of date or forgeries, and their vacant sites are sold for the M Benefit of the Municipality Last year on two occasions arrests were made on trumpery charges of local Europeanised Assyrians ; but this was before the arrival of the actual Governor. So that the discouragement of Christians must be a deliberate policy, which in the absence of a French or British Consulate Governors of L rumiah can carry out with impunity. All this does not make for the assured prosperity of this one important section of Azerbaidjan. (b) Subsidiary’ Disasters .—The disasters earthquake of last year ; reduced the population of the Salmas plain by about 60 per cent. Here an enlightened course has been pursued, and as Salmas now depends direct from Tabriz and no longer from Urumiah it will no doubt recover slowly. New sites have been given free, 200,000 tomans was distributed in relief and thtffe wdl be no taxes till 1935 or 1936. Lc549FD85 (c) Slmko. —Wherever I passed on the West side of the Lake T saw traces of or heard of the disastrous raids of Simko. Nagadeh itself following his raids had been reduced from 1,000 families to 215 only : and the Sulduz ha I suffered severely. Talu, Haidarabad and many adjoining villages had been abandoned and fallen into ruins. ^ These are merely two capital points of the Rawanduz Route, but there are scores of villages in other quarters which have never completely recovered from the raids and exactions of Simko and his men. It is to be hoped for the future of the Rawanduz Route that his mantle has not fallen upon the shoulders of the young son of Khurdish Ae-ha— chief of the Harki. This tribe ranges between Iraq and Turkey in winter, and the Ushnu hills in summer. Their migration is often accompanied by “ incidents ,y . Two years ago they attacked Ushnu at night and pillaged it, while last vear Khurdish Agha supported Simko in bis demands ; and the death of both of them (even rf they were treated in a treacherous manner, as is sometimes alleged) at Ushnu probably saved that section of the Province from renewed pillage. The “ settled ” Kurds are represented to me as being auite satisfied with the existing regime. ^ Probably they are, as they have a stake in the country. While those of the Urumiah Governorate are not called upon to furnish con scripts, those of Sauj-Bulak and Ushnu districts do so. All retain and carry their rifles, and seem ready upon these terms to aid the Government to repel raiders who might start by pillaging their own fields and huts. With an assurance of something approaching order and an intelligent fiCODomic i obey I quite agree with the many persons, starting with the Govern or of 1 rumiah himself, who declared that the Sauj-Bulak Sulduz, Ushnu, Urumiah and Salmas districts could produce five times what they did in 1929- nvi iawuui me umious economic mnn or the repercussion of materia prospen y upon the numbers of the population (and vice versa) : but besides this slow but automatic increase of population probablv other settlers would he speedily attracted to a zone which had a regular trade with Iraq and boasted its own outlet to the Mediterranean via Iraq.

Confidential letter from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz, to His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, His Britannic Majesty s Lega tion, Tehran, No. 60, dated the 16th July 1931. I have the honour to annex in the form of 2 memoranda, what I venture to consider fairly accurate resumes of the operations against the Northern Kurdish rebels between May 15th and July 4th 1931 (Phase I). 2. Phase TT from July 4th onwards has just begun, and no accurate informa tion as to military operations can ever be obtained here till well aitei the event. Enclosure 1. British Consulate, PHASE I. Tabriz. Northern Kurdish Situation up to July 4th. The first phase of military operations lasted from May 15th to June 20tli. There was then a pause, and operations restarted on July 4th. What follows is an attempt to reconstruct the main events of the first phase. The forces engaged were :— A. The Persians. —About 3,800 regulars with their staffs, 2,000 time expired men re-engaged voluntarily and paid 70 krans a month ; 1,200 Kurdish followeis of the 3 chief loyal Kurd Khans :— 600 followers of Omar Agha. 300 followers of Amar Khan. 300 followers of Sartib Agha. The entire Persian forces thus reached 7,000 rifles. Three aeroplanes were also sent from Teheran ; chiefly for reconnoitring work. These were at first all under the command of Sarhang Mohamed Ali Khan of the Urumiah Akhgar Regiment. He was, however, removed from the com mand and sent back to Urumiah, where he had returned about June 10th. The reason given is alleged to be a “ financial ” one and it is rumoured he will he summoned to Tehran for an investigation. The command was taken over by Sarhang Kalb Ali Khan of the Tabriz Tib. The latter returned to Tabriz during the lull following the second operations against Kera Eim but left for the scene of unrest again. Sartib Montashami spent most of the critical period near Maku \ he returned here towards the end of June, and made a rapid tour towards Sauy Bulak and Urnmiah but left again for Maku on July 6th and on July 11th was at Kera-Einu The triumphal entry here of the victorious troops which was announced for June 27th never materialized. B; The Kurds. —Equally accurate figures can naturally not be obtained. The main elements were the Persian Jolali and Haidaranlu tribes—probably 700 warriors—and about 300 Turkish Kurds from the Ararat zone. Total prob ably not much over 1,000. Kurdish Command. —This has been a cause of disagreement between the Kurdish Committee Hoybun and the actual rebels. Ihsan Nouri Pasha was considered to have deserted at the most critical moment last year, and as he was the Hoybun’s nominee the latter’s creoi sultered, Tne Hoybun therefore did not attempt this year to impose a upon the rebel Turkish Kurds, but allowed them to select one of the minor clw 1 sI 88 Apon the epot.

An interview was fixed on the Soviet frontier which Ardush attended together vith 6 armed Kurds. He and the 3 others were seized and taken to Tiflis. The - others were eventually released but Ardush was sent to Moscow and shot. The Operations : The Persians were afraid that the rebellious Persian- Jvurds might retreat into Turkey and raid Persian territory from there. Also J urkish* Diplomatic pressure w r as doubtless exercised, Parly in May the Persians began to concentrate their regulars at Maku mm began to cipl up time-expired men and the contingents of the loyal Kurd Khans. ■ • - • • advance was made upon Kara Eini to prevent the Jelali rebels under Haji Ismail Agha from crossing into Turkey and joining the Ararat rebels. Ismail Agha learnt of this concentration and hurriedly retired without ugh ting into Turkish territory. The Persians advanced and occupied the places evacuated, and captured some abandoned property and 17 non-combatants—who ' V( ‘i'« sent to Maku. On or about May 19th, the Jelali aided by a group of Turkish Kurds made a ra] d from Turkey and either surprised the Persians or ambushed them during a night march. The Persians called up their reserves from Maku, while more Turkish Kurds joined the Persian Kurds. The Persians on account of stubborn resist- miee offered even allege that Turkish regulars fought in Kurdish costume Against the Persian troops. The lighting lasted about a month in all (second half of May and first halt of Jll ne) with 3 short intervals of a day or two. The Persians 3 times announced i-coioFn(he enemy was defeated and dispersed-premature announeemnts m each ease, as a recrudescence of guerilla warfare always followed.

I will not risk any definite opinion upon this matter ; but merely draw attention to it.) The General himself left for Kara-Eini on July 6th and was reported to be there on July 11th. Enclosure 2.

In his final paragraph the Colonel admits severe losses in men and material, and in this respect he is saying the undisguised truth. As to the various separate incidents of the operations—extending over several months— which he quotes 1 confess that I cannot attempt to control them, [t is a well known method of “ cooking ” communiques to report one tiny incident and ignore another more important phase of the same operation situated a mile or two away. It is for instance, ridiculous to talk of one Persian soldier killed and several wounded at Karalan—and later on speak of “ severe losses ” ; while lorry loads °f medical stores and so forth were hurried north from here in June and wounded brought back here, 10. I do not believe that whole-hearted co-operation between Turkey and Persia is possible, as each absolutely distrusts the other and each has cause' to do The Turkish attitude is, as always in the case of someone considered weeker, inclined to be “ intransigeant ”« Dining my inception here on June 3rd the Turkish Consul-General’s son caused me extreme discomfort and great umbrage to the Persian High Officials who attended by loudly proclaiming to all who would listen that the Turkish troops were in Persian Territory, No doubt their presence can be explained away as “ joint occupation of a strategic road but the impression deliberately conveyed was that the Turks were within the Persian frontiers whether the Persians liked it or not—and that is no doubt the real situation, I was also told myself on another occasion that the Turks would not retire from this particular section of Persian Ararat whether the Persians agreed or n.

The balance sheet, which is as usual unaudited, shows a net profit on 1 he issued capital of 10.3 per cent., as compared with 8.2 per cent, for the previous year. It transpires incidentally that the five hundred thousand tomans (T.-500,000), which according to the budget of 1930-31 were to have been added 1° the Bank’s initial capital of eight hundred thousand tomans (T.-800,000), have not been paid up—a good many appropriations in that budget having apparently met with the same fate. 3. Great play is made in the annual report with the increase in the number accounts opened with the National Bank, from 5,253 to 8,617, but this must have been very largely due to the coercive methods adopted at the time when *he bank enjoyed a virtual monopoly of the exchange business. . 4. Dr. Lindenblatt is at the moment a far from popular figure in official circles, as he is held responsible for the Government’s investments in German banks.

He accuses the “ Near East ” of stirring up feeling against Persia in an effort to bring pressure to bear upon that feeble country-— a method alien to the amicable spirit with which all civilised nations to-day endea\our to inform their dealings. 4 The economic crisis through which Persia is passing, though conditioned hv the present world depression, has its origins, in the “ colonial policy ot Persia’s neighbours in the past witness the strangle-hold exercised by the 19U5 tariff, which stifled Persia’s economic life. 5. The Government Foreign Trade Monopoly law was the only means open to the Persian Government to deliver Persia from her economic subjection. This Law is absolutely compatible with all the Treaties and Conventions m force. 6. The writer suggests in the course of this article that the ” Near East ’ is an organ of the Government of India and “ certain English officials m the East ”. I presume that you would not wish me in any way to refute this sug gestion and vindicate the complete independence of the journal- 7. The second article contains no arguments with which you have not already been acquainted. They are both more moderate in tone than n previous effusion. 8. Copies of this despatch, with its enclosure, are being sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to the Department of Overseas Ira Postscript. —Since writing the above despatch, I have had the advantage of reading a full translation of the two articles in the “ Iran The encioseu summary fairly represents the substance of the first article ; but there is passage which I consider I should submit to you in full, as it express v a that the Foreign Trade Monopoly Law was designed to circumvent^tne Autonomy Treaty of 1928. I enclose a translation. Translation from the ’Iran, August 21st, 1931. Persia only succeeded in regaining her Customs Autonomy as dating Dphi 1936, by virtue of the Agreement of 1928. She had to make the sacrifice o ^ taining the present tariff stable till May, 1936 in order to gam eventua freedom, and in a country which has been exposed to the . COI l se( l ue ^ C - e{ ? general financial crisis throughout the world consequences, in fact, v me sitated a policy of the greatest elasticity—such a stable tariff has p r0 ^e ^ from favourable. The Persian Government had therefore no choice o combat the financial crisis on a different front.

His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the urel «. n , ^'“eretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of Mr. Lmgeman’s despatch, No. Overseas Trade tB 1-147 rht^l the 26th August 1931, on the subject of industrial developments in'Persia (Copy to His Majesty’s Acting High Commissioner for ’Iraa under P. L. No. 126, dated the 26th August 1931) q Despatch irom fhe Commercial Secretary, British Legation, Tehran to the Foreign Office, London, No. Overseas Trade (B.)-147, dated the 26th August 1931. The importance Avhicli the Persian Government attach to the development of native industries as a means of escape from what they look upon as an undue dependence on goods of foreign origin and all the evils resulting therefrom, with particular emphasis on the depreciation of the local currency, has been very much stressed recently both in ministerial statements and in the press. In fact the two primary causes of the Persian economic crisis are now said to be the excess of imports over (visible) exports and the stifling of all Persian industrial activity by an invasion of foreign products. The country must at all costs become more self-supporting and until this object is achieved the authorities, oblivious as they are of their treaty obligations, claim that they are justified in maintaining their monopoly of foreign trade—unless, it is hinted, His Majesty’s Government should choose to give Persia effective tariff autonomy forthwith by renouncing their rights to the rates laid down in the 1929 Treaty as applicable to British imports for the duration of the treaty. 2. There is no doubt whatsoever that the embargo on certain imports and the limitations imposed on the remainder, with a serious rise in the internal price level as an inevitable consequence, are exercising a most stimulating effect on w r ould-be industrialists. Hence, very largely, the fury with w T hich any refer ence to the provisional nature of the trade monopoly is decried. It is also clear that the development of local industries will help the Government to bring public opinion round to a more indulgent view of the monopoly laws, particularly if the authorities succeed in checking the gross profiteering in which local producers are now' revelling. 3. The following survey of present industrial tendencies may prove of interest. 4. Textile industries .—Where commerce and industry are concerned the Persian shews a striking lack of imagination and initiative. Once a new trail is blazed there are always flocks to follow it blindly, even if it leads to destruc tion. The present craze is for cotton spinning mills, and the Government are doing their best to exploit it. Their policy, the Minister of Court told me, is to instal a mill at each of the following places Yezd, Rafsinjan (the cotton growing centre near Kerman)—unless the Yezdis and Kermanis should combine to put one up at Rafsinjan, wfliich is unlikely—Meshed, either Sultanabad or Kermanshah. and perhaps Shiraz. Generally speaking the idea is to form panics with a capital of 500,000 Tomans to build and equip each mill with 3,000 spindles. The suppliers of the machinery are expected to participate to the extent of 50,000 Tomans ; the National Bank is to advance 100,000 Tomans on behalf of the Government ; wfliile local capitalists, i e., merchants and lane - owners—but principally the former who tend at the moment to turn from com mercial disappointments to industrial illusions are, m theory, to urms it balance of 350,000 Tomans. 5. Actually the Yezdis, who appear to be the keenest * h E’. ot ’,^ e B0 subscribed 180,000 Tomans and the Meshedis (of whom -00,000 T °“? n ® are expected) not more than 86,000 Tomans— perhaps because is i 3 •- expressed his intention of taking up shares to the value of a0,000 Tomans. As95 in the case of the formation of trading syndicates, unwilling participants among reputedly wealthy citizens are subjected to threats of man-handling by the pro vincial governors who have reasons to suppose that their reputation is at stake. Such forcible methods are more likely to damp than to engender enthusiasm it seems to me. , . 6. The part which the National Bank is being called upon to play in putting these state controlled projects into execution is of a nature to cause serious con cern. It is obvious that if Dr. Lindenblatt is to be allowed to repeat to his heart’s content the experiment he carried out at Aliabad, all hope of securing orders for British machinery will have to be abandoned. An entirely mythical investment of German capital in these mills would enable him to persuade the promoters that they must obviously buy German machinery, and of course emplov German experts. It is essential on the other hand, if this policy of industriali sation is to be enforced, that a determined effort should be made to introduce British machinery from the very beginning—which means that the Germans must be fought tooth and nail. 7. Apart from divulging confidentially Dr. Lindenblatt’s device to the agents who are representing the interests of British manufacturers—which has already had the result of inducing the Sultanabadis to ask the Government for a loan direct —I decided that it would be advisable to impart at least some of my fears to the Minister of Court, who insists on controlling these various schemes himself, so interested is he in the general subject of industrial develop ment, and obtain what gurantees I could. The presence in Tehran of an engineer engaged on the survey of the projected Baghdad-Haifa railway line gave me an opportunity of asking him for an interview which he accorded to me on August the 6th. 8. I told His Highness very frankly that as long as the National Bank advanced government funds to companies being formed for the purpose of putting up mills and factories in Persia I was very sceptical of British manufac turers of machinery being given a fair chance of competing. Teymourtache said that the trouble about British firms was that their prices were too high, they usually refused to grant credit, and they would certainly decline to invest capital in those new Persian industries. T replied that where prices were con cerned 1 would send him figures to show that the quotations I had received from Messrs. Dobson and Barlow, who were admittedly the most famous of all manu facturers of textile machinery, were below the German convention prices os quoted to Persia. Credits were a matter for negotiation : T doubted in any case whether under present conditions German firms would be able to grant very long ones : all I asked for was equality of opportunity and to that British firms were clearly entitled. Regarding foreign financial participation, if His High ness was referring to the Aliabad spinning mill I must point out to him that such participation might be fictitious. He enquired how that could be done and I told him by the very simple expedient of putting up the selling price to such an extent that when a discount, representing the alleged financial-investment in the venture, was taken off the manufacturer still obtained his original selling price. His Highness remarked that in that case Persia was paying the difference. I replied that I must leave him to draw his own conclusions. I expected an out burst but Teymourtache calmly stated that he was not in the least surprised— either owing to the disclosures of enormous profits made by the German section of the new defunct railway syndicate on their supplies of material from Germany ; or because His Highness was himself a party to the arrangement. This latter possibility T have always had in mind, as it is very doubtful whether the snares representing the German ‘ investment ’ were forced on the suppliers of the machinery, and somebody must have taken them. However, T felt that it was good policy to give Teymourtache to understand that it was no good beating the drum of “ German capital investments in Persian industry ”. The upshot of our talk was that he assured me that British manufacturers would be given an equal opportunity with the Germans of supplying the required machi nery in spite of what His Highness described as “a natural tendency on the part of Dr. Lindenblatt to favour German goods ”. Forgetting all other con siderations for the moment, he went so far as to say that British quotations would be accepted if they were one shahi below the German. I naturally had to be satisfied with this guarantee and I can but do my best to see that it is observed, although I feel far from optimistic on the subject. 9. Teymoutache informed me during the course of this conversation that the Government would not allow the erection of superfluous spinning mills else where. (There are private schemes to put up some in Tehran and Kachan.)The Government, he added, must control all industrial development from now on. Mistakes like that of the man who put up a match factory in such an un suitable place as Tabriz, where there was no wood to be had at an economic price, must not be allowed to recur. The Government moreover needed an &lt; agent d’execution ’ and that could only be the National Bank, for which pur pose it had to some extent been created. 10. I have already intormed you of the demand for machinery to finish cotton, woollen and silk fabrics in Yezd. The principal importer * of silks, before the monopoly came into force, a Jew named Cohen, also tells me that he has written to France for prices of silk weaving looms and to England for prices of wool weaving looms which he proposes to set up in Tehran with the consent of the Minister of Court. 11. A factory for the manufacture of artificial silk has been repeatedly refei red to in the papers. 12. Tanneries .—During the last couple of years small tanneries, equipped with German machinery, have been installed in Tabriz and Meshed—the latter being in financial difficulties, I hear, owing to the usual absence of any provision for trading capital. A few T weeks ago an Englishman, Mr. Kenneth Jones, who was for some time before the war in Russia in a big firm of general merchants and returned to that country after the Revoluion when he opened a tannery, came to see me. He said that although he had been working for the Soviet Gov ernment he found conditions becoming more and more impossible in Soviet Russia, and having heard of the Persian Government’s determination to foster the development of its industries he had shipped all his machinery to Persia. He said this was sufficient to turn out four or five hundred small skins (sheep and goat) and a hundred large skins (cow, ox and buffalo) a day. He hoped, if all went well, to start a boot and shoe factory later on. I subsequently spoke of him to the Minister of Court who was delighted and instructed the Minister of National Economics and other local authorities to give him every facility, which I gather has been done. 13. Sugar .—I need not expatiate on the subject of the sugar beet factory to be erected and equipped by a Czechoslovakian fipn at Kerej—the first of a projected series—as 1 have already reported on it in detail. I would however invite vour attention to the importance of the quota system as a means of pro tecting encouraging native industries. As the local production of a gi\en aiticle which°has hitherto been imported from abroad increases, the import quota tor that article is to be automatically reduced. 14. The Persian Government are clearly very anxious to develop this parti cular industry as sugar, after cotton goods, is the most important article o import, valued at £2 million in 1929130. The rumoured monopoly of sugar imports by the Government, by purchases m bulk from Soviet Russia and ek e where, must in some degree be intended as an assertion of the coun ry g import less when it needs less. 15. Tea—The Department is equally aware of the efforts which are being made to extend the cultivation of tea in Gilan and Mazanderan, slow hut steady progress being made. The imports of tea m 19-. j w million. 16. Matches.-T^ Minister of Court informed me at my inteiwiew that the Government had decided against the P r ?P T me because of Company for the grant of a match monopoly P ri A ^ 0 ^j-’wjs out of the objections to be expected from the Russian qu that the owner of a desire to stimulate the employment of l°^ a ^J^TChovi has agreed to construct the Tabriz match factorv, Han Mohamed Bagher Khoyi, has a^r ~ me laoriz maten mcioii, n , whether Mazauderan would not affoid a new factory in Isfahan I enffuffed wl ^ mueh WO od in the neigh- a more suitable site : I had ne\ei heard ot thoro was nlentv to he had bomhood of Isfahan. His Highness f‘t^ purpot Tbe repre- and that tiie wood of Mazanderan was too hard to the purpos^ ^ tentative of the Swedish Match Company c , 200 Kms. above Isfahan said that there were a few P°Pj ar ® a ^ n ? } t factory. The engineer who which it was suggested should he had probably fallen in with had been commissioned to make the T P on a sub j ect 0 f which Teyinourtache’s own very; decided question had not even been to he wus of conrse totally ignorant. 1 0 rts considered eminently suitable see the forests which the Swedish Match exports con. me after a prolonged study and all manner 097 17. Mr. Carlberg, after telling me that the new Isfahan factory and the old one in Tabriz when extended should be able to produce 30 million boxes a year each, instead of the 200 millions which the country needed, went on to say that he had reminded Teymourtache that the Turks had also thought of producing their own matches but that they had had to call in the Swedish Match Company C to do it for them after two years. In Persia too the company could afford to bide their time, all the more, he added to me in corroboration of previous state ments to the same effect, that Mr. Kruger was none too anxious to invest capital in Persia under existing conditions. 18. The above example confirms one’s natural suspicions that the new indus trial development in Persia is to be none too wisely controlled by the Govern ment. It is so typical of Persian superficiality to build a theory on wholly inadequate data and of Persian conceit to think that a Persian of moderate intelligence can in a few months acquire technical knowledge which in Europe represents the work of a life time. 19. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and His Majesty’s Acting High Commissioner for ’Iraq.

With reference to Foreign and Political Department, Express letter No. F.-3-N.|31, dated the 27th August 1931 [Serial No. (52)], I have the honour to submit the following views on despatch No. 410, dated the 30th July 1931 [Enclosure of Serial No. (51)1, H. M.’s Charge d’Affaires, Tehran, to H. M.’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London. 2. Mr. Lascelles, in the despatch quoted, states that Feroughi’s attitude appears to him “ logically almost unassailable ”, and I regret to say that I am inclined to agree with him. It has been the custom here to communicate with the Governor by letters in which the English and the Persian are put hi parallel columns but only the former has been signed. This means that it is only the English which is the guaranteed text and that the Persian has no value what soever, but is merely sent for the convenience of the recipient. The local Governor cannot be supposed to know English, and so from his point of view has to accept an official communication the language of which— English— he may have no knowledge. This prima facie puts him in an awkward position. 3. Considering the matter on the basis of reciprocity I do not know what the custom is in England with regard to the language used by Persian Consuls in their official communications, but I imagine that it is English ? In India as you point out—the Persian Consul General invariably addresses the Govern ment of India in English. 4. The inconvenience of consular officers having to sign the Persian text is obvious. Most consular officers in Persia have—it is true—a working knowledge of Persian, but that is quite a different thing to being able—without the expenditure of much time and trouble—to check carefully the Persian text which would be the official medium of their communications. As Mr. Lascelles also points out, the Persian language is quite inadequate to the needs of modern official communication. 5. 1 presume the demand of the Persian Government is that in future only the Persian text should be signed. A possible solution of the impasse, in the nature of a compromise, might be that both translations—English and Persian- should be signed by consular officers, thus giving both languages equal status. I merely put this forward as a very tentative suggestion. 6. In the meantime the Gilbertian situation exists here that H. M.’s Consul General is unable to communicate officially with the Governor. The practice I have adopted in communicating with him is to write the necessary letter, ana send my interpreter round to him to read it out ! This has sufficed well g 1101 ^ up-to-date. Both the last Governor and the present one were and are on friend y terms with me, and nothing serious has occurred which would entail the Governo actually receiving a letter from me, but it cannot of course continue as a perma nent arrangement. 7. 1 am sending a copy of this letter, together with a copy of your Express Letter quoted above, to H.

I have the honour to inform you that on April 8th I received a notification from the lersian Minister for Foreign Affairs that Mirza Hassan Ali Khan Ghaffari had been appointed Under-Secretary at that Ministry. 2. As reported in my despatch No. 180 of March 29th, 1929, Ghaffari was one of the two Secretaries-General appointed under the scheme whereby the Ministry for Foreign Affairs was reorganised in 1929 ; his career will be found in the list of biographies of Persian Notables. 3. The other Secretary-General, Mohammad Taqi Khan Isfandiari, has left the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on promotion to be Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Interior. J 4. Ghaffari s duties as head of the Department for Political Affairs were to all intents and purposes the same as those devolving on an Under-Secretary; now the somewhat obscure and evidently far from onerous duties formerly discharged by Isfandiari will also devolve on him. With the exception that one Under-Secre tary will henceforth replace tw r o Secretaries-General, the administration of the Ministry remains on the same lines as those mentioned in my despatch referred to in paragraph 2 above. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Govern ment of India and to His Majesty's High Commissioner for Iraq. (*?) (Received on 2nd May 1931, with Political Secretary's letter No. 16, dated the 16th April 1931). Letter from the British Embassy, Moscow, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 138, dated the 23rd March 1931. I have the honour to forward herewith a translation of an article dealing with Persia’s present economic difficulties which appeared in “ Economicheskaya Shizn of March 21st. This Soviet analysis appears to be farily objective, but the tempta tion to show that a British bank was responsible to a large degree for the depreciation of the Persian currency could not be resisted. 2. The article concludes, no doubt regretfully, that Persia is contemplating a way out of her present difficulties by inviting a more extensive participation of foreign capital, and by seeking at the same time to establish a new trade route with the West which would free her from her present virtual dependence on the Soviet Union. 3. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade. The Economic crisis and Persian Currency. For a whole year Persia has been suffering from an acute economic crisis, the mt sign of which last year was a sudden and sharp fall in the Persian exchange v Inch s °on affected all branches of the national economy.21 The Government decided to establish a strict control over all exchange opera tions. Shortly afterwards it was officially stated that the Government had decided to change over from a silver to a gold currency. The change-over was to take place in the new year, i.e., about March 1931. In the summer of 1930 the Mejlis passed a further law whereby exporters were ^ obliged to hand over to the Government or to certain specially authorised banks 90 per cent, of the foreign currency realised as a result of their operations, receiving in exchange Persian currency at a rate fixed by a special commission. In case the exporter wished to use some of his funds for importing goods into Persia, he was allowed to reserve for this purpose 60 per cent, of his foreign currency and hand over to the Government only 40 per cent. In practice, however, the Government regulation did not give the desired results, as contraband trade in foreign curren cies assumed alarming proportion, and Persian merchants purchased foreign money on the private market at much higher rates than those officially fixed. In addition to this, a most important rule in the depreciation of the Persian exchange was played by the English Shahinshah Bank, which for the last forty years and more had followed a speculative policy, manipulating now a rise, now a fall in the Persian exchange. By virtue of a concession agreement the Shahinshah bank issued banknotes, and its notes are in circulation to-day to the amount of some 18 million kran. In connection 'with the change-over to the gold standard the bank is now proposing to buy up these notes, and if it is clearly in the interests of the bank to depreciate the value of the kran as much as possible in order to reduce the sum which it will have to pay in sterling to redeem its notes. By declining to sell drafts and by using every possible influence on the quotations commission, the Anglo-bank is trying to raise the rate of the pound from 60 to 75 or more kran. There has recently been a certain steadiness in the rate of the pound, but a marked soaring of prices of export goods, especially carpets. This is due to the fact that the majority of leading Persian marchants, fearing losses owing to the impending change-over in Persian currency, are investing their savings in goods. Besides this, as a result of the measures for regulating exchange operations, Persian Foreign trade decreases in the same proportion as the difficulties placed in the way of transaction with foreign firms increase. In order to stimulate export the Government is trying to increase the carpet industry by improving the quality of its products and also by assisting the development of certain agricultural prm ducts. An attentive examination of the present economic situation, however, shows that all these measures are merely palliatives. The truth lies in the fact that the economic crisis which has developed in Persia is due in part to depressed conditions abroad, but mainly to the economic and political organisation of Persia itself. Persia's main economic activity is agriculture, which continues to be almost the sote source of her exports. Of late years there has been falling off in the export of such products as cotton, rice and dried fruits, and this falling off is chiefly due to a decrease in the marketable production of these commodities. This in turn is caused by the systematic destruction of Persian peasant economy by extremely heavy taxation, and also to increased exploitation by landowners, old and new. At the same time agricultural methods have remained on the same pitiful level as that of centuries ago. The poor peasant is unable to resist this double pressure, and is often compelled to give up the land. In the almost complete absence of developed industry in Persia, peasants giving up the land must either emigrate or become vagabonds. There is no practical basis for all the discussions about the extensive indus trialisation of Persia. Very few industrial enterprises exist in the country, and these usually belong to second or third rate industries (soap, matches, brick-making, paper, etc.) and correspond rather to handicraft establishments than tofactones. If Persian imports during recent years are analysed, they will be found to consist mainly of consumption articles (textiles, kerosine, sugar, etc.); machinery account ing for not more than 5 per cent. The tone of many Persian newspapers suggests that influential Persian circles are inclined to seek a way out by a more extensive attraction of foreign capital, by further colonial enslavement of the country.

MasoFD * Not printed.23 Bisume of report on road alignments between Charbar and Bampur. The Geographical conditions must confine the question of an alignment to the three valleys of the rivers Gai, Kadja and Sarbaz. In accordance with instructions received from the Ministry of Communications the reconnaissance oi ^ the route up the Kadja valley was undertaken. This alignment has certain advantages but as it follows a vallev through very mountainous country, it cannot avoid heavy constructional expenses. ° Its chief advantage is that the gradients are easy. In the valley itself the general slope is never more than 1 in 330. Crossing two minor watersheds sec tions of 7 and 44 kilometres the gradient is 1 in 200 and on the main pass (Aspagan) 1,200 metres from kil. 71 to kil. 223 the gradient commences at 1 in 330 and gra dually increases to 1 in 100. A few minor obstacles might necessitate gradients of 1 in 25 but these could be reduced to 1 in 50 by small detours and works not involving unduly costly construction. The other advantages of this alignment are that it passes through a compara tively populated district and is fairly well supplied with water. The disadvantages are that the broad valley of the Kadja gradually contracts 'the sides becoming steep and in the end it developes into a narrow gorge with precipitous banks. Owing to the rise of the water level in times of flood it is impossible to take advantage of the low river terraces. The road must be taken up the sides of the hills \\ here rock and other formations are encountered involving expensive working. In addition there are many tributary streams to be crossed requiiing long detours or alternatively expensive bridges and embankments. Of the two banks the left offers the least difficulty. All measurements have been made with a 20 metre chain. Heights were taken with an aneroid barometer. Bearings have been taken with a prismatic compass. Cubic measurements have been calculated from dinometer read ings. In accordance with my instructions to estimate for a road for motor traffic I have allowed for a road width of 4 metres on rocky slopes (excluding the embankment), and 5 metres on soft ground and in open country. In general onl)/ the clearing of stones, rough levelling and in some places drainage channels lave been estimated for.

Under the most favourable conditions the work will take 20 months. As the road will necessitate 160 kilometres of costly work it is obvious that the alignment should be a permanent one. For this a further and more accurate survey is required to consider the question of minor detour to avoid places of exceptional difficulty. This supplementary survey will occupy at least 4 months. If the Government is determined to press forward with its project of connecting K hoi at an to the Persian Gulf by a road through Baluchistan it would be advis able to examine also the alternative alignment. A possibility which should be borne in mind and might well be examined is that of taking the road along the river bed by means of retaining walls. It migin be possible to reduce the expenditure in this manner by perhaps T. 100.000. In my opinion the construction of this expensive road can only be justified by military or political considerations known best to the Persian Government. From the economic and trade points of view the project is not v arrante . ( 22 ) Memorandum from the British Legation, Tehran, Xp. 114, dated the 6th May 1931. His Britannic Majesty's Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of'the document mentioned below, on the subject of Mr. Lmgeman s journey to Mazanderan:— Report by the Commercial Secretary, 5th May, 1931..of tirrailwavl^OctoWl^f v f “ m P re hen S ive report on the technical aspect ol tiie railv a) October last winch he forwarded to the War Office at the time I need therefore do no more than record my personal impressions of what l saw. 11. The line is obviously very well laid, no expense having been spared in its construction. Even the Belgian engineers—there are two and a Frenchman- admitted this Although it took us something like five hours to travel 128 Km m a very comfortable carriage, at an average speed therefore of 16 miles anhour they said there was no reason why the train should not be driven at 100 Km an hour The absence of freight and the slowness of the journey were explained b&gt; the fact that the trains were essentially ‘ trains de service ’ which took building materials from one point to another, but it is difficult to imagine what freight there could possibly be except for cotton and rice from one station to another nearer a port of shipment. 12. It is curious to see the very German, but not unattractive, and so 1 idly built stations dotting the Persian country-side. They remind one that the German contractors are far from being entirely to blame for the comparatively high cost of construction, taking the line as a whole. They are the first to admit for instance that the station at Sari with its 10,000 or so inhabitants would normally suffice far a town ten times as large. They also say that they built in the end only half the number of stations, complete with waiting rooms and concrete lavatories for the two sexes, which the Persians asked for. 13. One is naturally inclined to look upon this railway as a mere toy—an inclination which is heightened by the excitement of the populace at the stations, where the lavatories of the first class carriage seem to often an irresistible form of attraction for the bolder spirits—but I at least found myself a little carried away by the grandeur of the scenery. The terminal at Bandar Shah also seemed quite impressive in the twilight and most business like—particularly the engine shed with its studio-like windows, its five gigantic locomotives and luxuriously fitted work shop. One feels quite at the end of the world in this corner of the Turkoman plain and the battle being waged against swamp and sea seems born of quite a noble conception until one remembers with a start how useless it all is—and how very pathetic. 14. There were already enough mosquitoes about—great big black brutes— to make one realize how malaria ridden and intolerable the whole place must be in the summer. Yet plans are being gaily laid for the construction of a large town at Bandar Shah ! As the Persian engineers who took us round remarked, millions of tomans would first have to be spent on the reclaiming of the swamps that stretch right up to the station in winter. 15. To travel to the end of the jetty in a slow moving trolly is quite an excursion, there being 1,050 metres of mud embankment and 1,440 metres of wooden structure. There was not a single ship in sight. 16. The Belgian engineers are apparently being entrusted with the extension of the line to Surkh Kulah (marked Serkala in some maps), 30 Km. South of Aliabad, along the river bed. Two small tunnels will probably have to be built. They hope to be allowed to continue the line as far as Tehran, their pohe\ emg obviously to make out that they can build it much cheaper than the Germans and flatter Persian sentiment by making use of as many Persian engineers as possible. M. van der Hulst wears a Pahlavi cap, which says a great deal for his methods. He boasted to me that he could construct the mountain section at one-third of the German estimate by steepening the gradient from 2 to 4- 2 per cent, and narrowing the curves from 300 to 200 metres. AMiat was ue use, e sai , of building a perfect railway, designed to carry an enormous amount of traffic at the most economic rates, when that traffic did no exis . 011 to cater for 300 tons a day. I suspected at the time that he had ^mpiy adopted with slight modifications, the plans for an alternative and niom economical trace which had been submitted by the remembered, Government as not being good enough. (1 he by ’ t t i always maintained that they could show a saving o , t • estimated cost of £35 million for the whole North to South line by putting in sharper curves and steeper gradients.) , 17. This suspicion has now been “'^^Yhe'Gema^sVere'justlbouAo me something about the revised estimates wlncii MC280FDput in. He said that they were ready to contract for the completion of the line from Aliabad to Tehran in five years for a fixed sum of Sl4 million and 20 million tomans, representing an economy of almost two-thirds on the estimates which had originally been accepted by the Government in principle. The maximum gradient was 4i per cent, and the minimum curve 220 metres. They would guarantee that this line would carry fifty trains a day if need be l Realizing the difficulty for the Persian Government of finding foreign exchange under existing condi tions they had prepared an ascending scale of payments for the dollar portion, the first instalment to be paid in the second year only and the last in the eight or ninth. They were not asking the Government to pledge any given security but would be content with clean trade bills. I suggested to Mr. Brown that he had already arranged for the discounting of these bills. He smiled and said that Persia's financial credit was still surprising the good in Europe. It was perhaps in this connection that a director of the Deutsche Orient Bank recently appeared in Tehran on a short visit. ' 18. Mr. Brown admitted that he was very much afraid that these proposals would be turned down by the Persian Government as the latter seemed intent at the moment on extending the line at both ends themselves. He thought, however, that van der Hulst, who was no construction engineer, would get himself into an awful mess in two or three months. The Germans could afford to play a waiting game. He was also in favour of allowing Mr. Carroll in the South, enough rope to hang himself. With luck they (whoever 4 they' may be) would also secure the southern contract within a year. “If only ', he added piously x “ we could get a good British firm to take over the task of construction'.

Where a company registered outside Persia is bound by the laws of the counti \ registration to publish a balance sheet, a copy of the latter could presum ably be procured by the Persian authorities should they set out to do so. There would appear at first sight to be little advantage, therefore, in refusing to give the authorities a copy ot such a balance sheet should they apply for it. Circum stances may arise, however, when it would seem almost advisable to make difficul- -i k s wit i a yew to secure more reasonable terms. See in this connection the last paragraph of this despatch. o. \\ here a foreign registered company is under no such obligation (to publish a balance sheet) it should be entitled to claim that its accounts are its own private concern, invoking at the same time the Note to Article 14 of the Income Tax Law, which states that the inspection of books and registers in order to form an estimate ot the tax payable is strictly forbidden. 4. At the same time it should be borne in mind that the financial authorities, n not assisted in their task, may very well resort to highly arbitrary methods, such as the imposition of a tax on every carpet exported, representing their estimate of the profit which is likely to accrue to the company from its sale. In my opinion the Standard Carpet Company would be well advised to take legal advice on so delicate a question. You might possibly refer its Kerman manager to Dr. Macharaff Naficy, 3 Khiaban-i-Nazemul Atteba, Tehran, who understands English well and is well-known to this Legation. 6. Confidential. It may interest you to know that one foreign carpet company operating in Persia (the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers) has claimed that its Persian organisation merely acts in the capacity of commission agents on behalf of its various offices abroad, including of course those of affiliated companies, and that it 18 consequently only liable to pay the registration fee incumbent on commission agents. This, I am told by the local manager of the company, is strictly true, twenty per cent, being charged for manufactures and seven per cent, for purchases. 1 he Persian Ministry of Finance, however, has adopted the absurd view that the company should furnish a copy of the balance sheet of every one of its numerous29 offices dealing in Persian carpets, so as to exact a percentage of the profits realized on their sale. I understand, incidentally, that the company lost ten thousand pounds (£10,000) as the result of its operations in Persia during the last financial year. 7.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 193, dated the 8th May 1931. With reference to my despatch No. 210 of May 17th, 1930 [see enclosure of Serial No. (61), File No. 21 -N. of 1930], I have the honour to transmit a report by the Acting British Consul in Shiraz on events and conditions in Fars during the year ended March 31st last. 2. I consider that Mr. Trott deserves great credit for so clear and full a sum mary. 3. Two points, namely, his assumption that arms are at present being smuggl ed into Persia all along the shores of the Gulf (see paragraph 14), and his statement that the Shah is still very popular personally in Fars (paragraph 16), struck me as calling for substantiation, and I have requested Mr. Trott to report further by safe hand concerning them. 4. I had recently heard on good authority that the Amir Lashkar Shaibani was in disgrace, and had been received only once by the Shah since his return to Tehran last February. The attached copy of a memorandum on this subject by the Oriental Secretary is of considerable interest in view of the General s great actual (and greater potential) importance as a factor in Persian politics. 5.

' Summary of events and conditions in Pars from April 21st 1931. I 1st 1930 To March The principal event of the summer of 1930 was the attempt of the Persian Government forces to continue their policy of subduing and disarming the various tnbes of the province. The situation at the beginning of the period under review was that the Qashqais were somewhat exhausted after the troubles of the previous year and unwilling to recommence hostilities ; the Khamseh were divided and leaderless ; the Mamassam and Boir Ahmadi tribes were unsubdued, truculent and well armed ; several well-known robbers were at large : and the Persian troops under Amir Lashkar Habibullah Shaibani. were in Shiraz, without much prestige ? in view of their inconclusive campaigns of 1929 and the complete failure of their attempts to control the Mamassani from October 1928 to March 1929. 2. The first objective was the Mamassani tribe. The Aadin regiment left Shiraz for Kazarun on the 28th June, and detachments of the Pahlavi and of the liizapur regiment left Shiraz the next day for Aedakan. A force of cavalry was collected at Abadeh on the Shiraz—^Isfahan road, under the command of Sardar Bahadur Bakhtiari, with a view to advancing west and south. Nasir Khan son of Ismail Khan Qashqai (Soulat-ud-Douleh) arrived from Tehran at the end of June and his father went off to the Qashqai tribe’s summer quarters to assist in raising tribal levies to join in with the Government troops against the Mamassanis, and from the north the Bakhtiari tribe’s assistance w r as invoked. 3. Nothing much was done for a w T eek or two except to concentrate a main body, consisting of 4,000 to 5,000 men, at Ardakan, under the personal superinten dence of the Amir Lashkar in the hope that the Mamassani wmuld be impressed by such a large force and come to terms without fighting. A diversion was created by a disturbance in the Lar area. A rebel named Biza Khan, together with Zahdan Khan who had given trouble in 1929, attached and captured Lar. A force under Colonel Zia-ud-Din Khan, composed mostly of the Silahshur regiment, was sent out to deal with the rebels, but for a long time did not get beyond Fasa. The gal lant Military Governor of Lar, Muhammad Taghi Khan Arab, was eventually killed by the insurgents shortly before the relieving force recaptured Lar, about the end of July. 4. During July negotiations proceeded at Abadeh between Sardar Bahadur Bakhtiari and the heads of the Boir Ahmedi tribe, with a view to coming to some amicable settlement. As however the tribe wanted to be left completely to them selves, to be immune from conscription, and to retain their arms, no agreement was reached. In the Mamassani area Imam Quli Khan, one of the principal chiefs of the tribe, also offered the Amir Lashkar to come to terms without fighting, but the latter replied that he had come to fight and not to negotiate. The Government troops were therefore ordered to advance into the tribal territory both of the Mamas sani and of the Boir Ahmedi tribe. The unseasoned troops suffered great hardships from the lack of adequate transport and from the severe heat. But the Qashqais joined in on the Government side, albeit without much enthusiasm, and the combined attack began. From the south and west the main body from Ardakan advanced. From the^east Sardar Bahadur’s force started to move. From the north-east the Qashqais advanced, and the Bakhtiaris, further to the north, w r ere persuaded, as the result of a personal visit from the Minister of War from Tehran (Saidar As ad) armed wdth a thousand rifles and a liberal advance of cash, to join forces with their old enemies the Government against their older and worse-hated tribal rivals, the Mamassani and the Boir Ahmedi. The visit of the Minister o \ ar to Chighakur the tribal centre of the Bakhtiaris took place in the first week ot August. MC280FD31 5 The rebellious tribes pursued their time-honoured Parthian tactics, combined with a few night attacks in which a great deal of ammunition was expended with out much result. The troops suffered greatly from thirst and sustained a good many casualties. The country in which the fighting took place was of an extremely difficult nature, consisting of rocky valleys full of almost impenetrable fastnesses /* and appalling mountain paths. The defenders knew every inch of it, the attackers practically nothing. It was not surprising that about 700 troops (to quote to lowest estimate) lost their lives. The casualties among the Mamassanis and the Boir Ahmedis are quite unknown but were probably much less. However the heads of the Mamassani tribes gave up the struggle at last, and came in under a safe- conduct in September. Imam Quli Khan, Mulla Qubad Sisakhti, and Shukmllah Khan, went to Tehran where they were honourably received by His Majesty the Shah and given a pardon. The leaders of the Boir Ahmedi tribe however, named Sartip Khan, Luhrasp Khan and Mir Ghulam remained at large until later, as recorded below. 6. Seeing that his troops had regained a certain amount of prestige by the surrender of the Mamassani chiefs, and being anxious to retain the advantage gained, the Amir Lashkar decided in October to maintain a small garrison in Arda- kan district throughout the winter, and supplies for that purpose were hurriedly sent to Ardakan from Shiraz. The main body of the troops returned to Shiraz early in December. The posts which were left behind were attacked, and in the subsequent fighting Luhrasp Khan was killed, and Mir Ghulam wounded. Thus most of the leading rebels were accounted for, except Sartip Khan. The Amir Lashkar had reason to be pleased with the general result of his operations. 7. It must not be imagined however that the tribal question is settled. It is still true that the Persian authorities at Shiraz have little real control over the prin cipal tribes of the province. The latter are not subject to conscription, maintain their dislike for the Pahlavi hat, and have a thorough contempt for the quality of the Persian soldier. Disarmament has not taken place with any thorough ness. During October and November military posts were placed in many stra tegic places, such as the Pal-i-Khan on the Shiraz—Isfahan road, with the view of intercepting the tribesmen on their autumn migration to the south, and taking away their rifles. No doubt a few arms were thus obtained ; but it is equally certain that the Qashqais, the Boir Ahmedis and the Mamassanis have still a good many good rifles. The influence of Soulat-ud-Douleh (Ismail Khan Qashqai) with the Qashqai tribe remains predominent, and he it is who has collected the tribal taxes and re mitted them to the Finance Department, after taking his own ample pickings; but he must remember the unpleasant months he spent in prison at Tehran recently, and is not the sort of man who would give up arms for nothing. However, the tribes of Fars are incurably at loggerheads and the Government plays them on one against another. Moreover they are short of ammunition. 8. Towards the end of the period under review the serious economic situation was reflected in a recrudescence of brigandage. The well-known robber Mehdi Surkhi escaped from Shiraz at the end of December and ranged the southern parts of the province plundering caravans here and there. Various robberies on the Lar road and in the direction of the Bundar Abbas,-Kerman road were also reported. The military were, however, in more or less effective control of the principal towns, and the increased used of cars and consequent improvement of com munications were all in favour of the central government. 9. Most of the troops which had been sent to Fars for the tribal operations had left Shiraz by the end of February, leaving about 3,000 troops in Shiraz. The various regiments were as follows the Fouj Silahshur, the Fouj Nadri, and ha of the Fouj Pahlavi composed the infantry ; the first named being in Shiraz, t ie second mostly in Nurabad and Fahlian, and the third for the most part in the Lar district. The cavalry regiment Fouj Abbasi had its headquarters in Shiraz, bu most of its troops were on detachment in the Mamassani, Ardistan and Lanstan areas. A mountain-gun battery was also in Shiraz. 10. In the middle of February the Amir Lashkar left for Tehran and the Gov ernorate-General became civil once more, for the first time since the 1929 rising- The new Governor General Muzaffar ATam (Sardar Intisar) combined the pos s of Vali of Fars and Governor of the Gulf ports..11. At the end of February the Indo-Furopean Telegraph Department handed over their equipment to the Persian Telegraph administration, and Mr. Petherick, the Assistant Superintendent, left for the United Kingdom during March The property of the Department was offered for sale. 12. During March a good deal of petty robbery and brigandage went on. Some caravans on the Bushire road near Bushire were held up and looted. A band of brigands under one Bashir established themselves in a fort named Mazijun between Lar and hasa and were dislodged with some difficulty by Persian troops. Petty robberies in the towns were also frequent. 13. Sartip Khan of the Boir Ahmedi tribe went to Tehran during March and received a royal pardon for his misdeeds. This left only Mir Ghulam at large of the leaders of the rebellion of last year. The various leaders have not however been punished. The present policy of the government is to maintain permanent posts in the Boir Ahmedi and Mamaseani country at Fahlian, Nurabad, etc., charg ed with the duty of seeing that the Boir Ahmedis and Mamassanis should remain as they are at present, split up among various sections of the Qashqai tribes who, in the past, were their neighbours. 14. Ismail Khan Qashqai (Soulat-ud-Douleh) actually began, towards, the end of March 1931, to fulfil the terms of a written undertaking which he had given to the Governor General, saying that he would hand over all the remaining Qashqai rifles within a few days. Only about 1,000 however were produced, and those were for the most part old Martinis. Whether he will produce any more remains to be seen. Meanwhile new rifles and ammunition are no doubt being smuggled into Persia all along the shores of the Persian Gulf. Soulat appears to have a magnetic personality, enabling him to outwit, even the Persian Government. He still makes much of the fact that he once fought with some success against British troops ; perhaps this fact endears him still more to the Persian Government, as a proof of nationalistic spirit. His son is the Il-Khani of the Qashqai tribe, and he himself is being elected to the new Majlis. 15. From an economic point of view the state of the province at the end of the period under review was almost as bad as it could be. Government inter ference with opium cultivation, and corrupt administration of ill-advised laws, have resulted in the curtailment of the opium sowings, opium being the chief source of the province’s wealth. Taxation has reached a high level and merchants are asking what they get in return. Foreign exchange scarcely exists at all owing to the new law monopolising all trade in the hands of the Government. Foreign trade has stopped. The standard of life of the Persian is rising with the new tastes brought by the advance of western civilisation. The currency is to be con\erted into unfamiliar token-money, at probably a disadvantageous rate. The geneial standard of morality of the province is no better than it ever was , the justice department, after much advertised attempts to set itself in order after the new reforms initiated by Davar is now more corrupt than ever and no sensible claimant takes the disastrous and expensive step of appealing to it. The rainfall has been less than that recorded during any similar period m past years ; so that famine crops are likely, with consequent distress, followed, as is usua m ersia, } n gandage. To crown all locusts have appeared, much earlier than usual. 16. On the other hand, the elements of hope in the situation are as follows probably avert an actual famine. 17. If gloomy forebodings turn out to be correct, the sulfermgs o * « peop e t^haft’it'SS w^Pe^s a part the storm will break on the heads of the Germans, the Russians, or even the present re B i . (Sd.) A. C. TROTT, Acting ConsulMemorandum by the Oriental Secretary. His Majesty’s Minister, • Reference to Shiraz Despatch No. 20 dated 21st April, 1931. Amir Lashkar Shaibani. The position of Shaibani since his return from Fars has appeared to me verv curious and I have been endeavouring for some time to get to the bottom of it I have not been able to glean the reasons for his sudden fall from favour It ig certain that he is not the favourite he was. He came here with what he regarded as a promise of employment in Azerbaijan. This has not been fulfilled. The reason may be that for the moment the Shah does not want to appear to attach importance to that province ; whatever the real reason may be 1 am told by more than one of Shaibani’s cronies that he is Very disappointed at what he considers a relegation to the great army of unemployed Amir Lashkars. A possible reason is that it is the Shah’s known policy to keep Generals who have rendered service to him on the “ waiting list ” and not to give them any reason to think that they are becoming indispensable. Another reason may be that Shaibani has allowed Soulet too much rope with his tribe and thanks to ShaibanFs protection Soulet has again become the big man of Fars, This has annoyed Qawam and perhaps others and it has probably not given the Shah much pleasure either.

With reference to your despatch No. 569 (E.-5773/5773/34) of November 5th last, I have the honour to inform you that the Mejlis on the 21st instant passed a bill authorising the engagement of the following Belgian financial experts :— 1. N. Charles Clavier, to be Director-General of the revenue administration and at the same time economic adviser to the Government, at a salary of £2,700 a year. 2. M. Rene-Henri Lefevre, to serve as assistant to M. Clavier, at a salary of £1,350. 3. M. Leon Smets, to serve as Treasurer-General, at a (salary of £l ,350. 4. M. Darius Daris, to serve as assistant to the Treasurer-General, at a salary of £1,040. 2. Half of these salaries will be payable in sterling which will be freely transfer able abroad, and half in local currency at the official rate of the day. Rent allow ances varying between one hundred and fifty tomans a month and a travelling allow - ance for the journey out of one hundred pounds will also be paid. 3. There was a certain amount of opposition to the bill, one deputy maintain ing that the money spent on Doctor Schniewind s mission had been so much money wasted ; he was afraid that the same would be said of M. Clavier and his as^- tants when they eventually left the country, and suggested that the money set aside for their salaries would be much better devoted to the construction of a fac tory. The Minister of Finance, however, insisted that I ersia still needed out side assistance and called attention to the fact that one of her most powerfuneighbours (Russia) still employed thousands of foreign experts in spite of the progress it had achieved in the last two hundred and twenty years. 4. According to the &lt;£ Iran ” these four Belgian officials are expected in Tehran towards the end of June.

Our local Divisional Commander, who has been away in Tehran, has now returned to Meshed. I called on him in my usual way the day after his return. The object of my call was to introduce to him four officers from Staff College Quetta who had come up here on a week’s visit. He received us in his usual friendly way but suddenly threw a very unpleasant bombshell by telling me that owing to circumstances beyond his control he would be unable to entertain my guests in the way he and his predecessor had done in the past. He afterwards told me that he had received special instructions from His Imperial Majesty per sonally, that he and his subordinates were in future to have no social relations with foreigners. He was also informed that the military in Khorasan were known to have been unduly friendly with the British in the past and that this was to cease forthwith. He assured me that this new order was not directed against us in parti cular, but against all foreigners in general.” (33) Memorandum from the British Legation, Tehran, No. 132, dated the 20th May 1931.

His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the subject of the situation in Azerbaijan. Despatch Confidential from His Majesty’s Consul Tabriz, No. 41 , dated 26th May, 1931. A copy has been sent to the Foreign Office. Letter from H. M’s. Consul Tabriz to H. M’s. Minister Tehran, No. 41, DATED THE 26TH May 1931. Situation in Azerbaijan. I have the honour to report that there has been considerable discontent ex pressed here with the Exchange Laws and the Import Monopoly Law. 2. Bolshevik propagandists have seized the opportunity thus offered to sow their seed in receptive soil. 3. After the propagandist notices at Novrus which—as already reported— resulted in the arrest of 2 or 3 Armenians and Persians connected with Russian trade organizations Seifullah Ibrahimoff—the head of the Baku G. P. U.—arrived here 4&gt;n May 21st and is staying at the Grand Hotel. This Hotel which has a Loud-Speaker giving out news from Tiflis in the Turki dialect, is the usual headquarters here of Bolshevik birds of passage. Ibrahimoff had been nominated as a Russian expert for the anti-locust cam paign in the Mughan, and appears to have employed his tour there to disseminate Bolshevik: or at least rebellious ideas among the Shahsevan tribes. His arrival coincided with another dispersal of Bolshe\ik proclamations and leaflets 'which occurred on May 22nd. 4. Even the fanatical religious element of Tabriz appears not unlikely to play into the hands—though unwittingly*—of the pro-Bolsheviks. The latter urge the religious element to insist upon their Moharram processions , vhile the I okce MC2£0FP39 break these up unmercifully. As a procession on May 22nd opposed Police ord to disperse, 20 of the ring-leaders were arrested. At other processions on the 23rd and 24th—also broken up—some of the d monstrators sang words to the effect that: “ Those who break up religions must inevitably be punished ^ i 5. There is no vestige of popularity remaining here, I believe, for the Shah - and one can only hope that if he really does visit Tabriz this year, as is rumoured’ there may be no similar incident to that which marked Mussolini’s visit to Bologna in 1927. 6. A military agent here apparently thought he had discovered some evidence of the existence of a plan to make a concerted pro-Bolshevik rising on May 24th and whether this be the true reason or not a few military armed guards were placed in certain quarters of the town and around the military centres. Yesterday (May 25th) these small pickets were confined to the vicinity of the barracks and military deposits only. 7. As if to coincide with the above situated news spread on May 24th. that there had been fairly severe fighting between Persian troops and Persian and Turkish Kurds at Kara-Eini and Agh Gol, spots near little Ararat; in which the .Persians had had 120 Persian and 4 Armenian soldiers and officers killed. On Ma} 25th there vas a further strong rumour that the Kurds had actually been able to seize Maku itself. 8. At about 10 a.m. yesterday three military biplanes flying in close V for mation passed over this building on their way from Tehran to the new Military Aerodrome. One landed at once, while the others circled over the town, thus causing the impression that there were five of them. These 3 planes left at ^ • 15 to-day in the direction of Maku, after again circling over the town. 9. I am also told that because of the state of unrest in the town (but in my opinion also because the last readily available troops 500 in number had already been sent from here to Maku last week) it is not now considered “safe to send any more troops there from here at present. I ma\ add here that last week some peasants were attacked on the road here rom k,ofian , 2 were killed and their carpets (for sale) and money stolen. The assailants excaped and have not been traced. 10. Se\eral veeks ago the Turkish Consul-General told me that the Turkish plan of campaign against the Kurds would be totally different this year. Last year they had insisted on the Persians holding their frontier to prevent lugiti\ es crossing into Persian and reorganizing there for fresh exploits. This year, on the contrary, the Turks proposed to drive the Kurds into Persian territory— which was less mountainous and where the Kurds could be more easm rounded up while the Turks would hold their side of the frontier to pre vent the Kurds’ return. 1. This programme, if both parties willingly and loyally co-operated, would ( ; oubt be excellent ; but from Zia Bey’s manner I certainly gathered that the lurks would act as above if it happened to suit them—whether the Persians acquiesced m advance or not. i ^ ^ 18 0 j vious that the Persian Conscript Army of the North-West is iar( \ | task thus inflicted on it at intervals not of its own selection, and it v ou a so seem fairl\ T probable that the Persians’ consequent moments of military Y* 1 “ men : s are . ^ e bberately calculated so as to. coincide with probable anti- f \ nas ic manifestations such as these religious processions of Moharrem ; and are a so marked by a most bare-faced recrudescence of Bolshevik propaganda. I am not sure, however, that there is co-operation between the Turks and Kussians ; for each seems to be playing their own hand still. I have already reported the anti-dynastic placards affixed here at Novruz, an ie return here of a well known Bolshevik agitator who is presumed to have Drought the text of these proclamations with him.

I)oyon Urther Zia Be7 liaS always insisted whenever possible upon his position as I have not objected to this at all —except in the two specific cases above and in one or two other minor cases where Zia Bey has tactfully given way at once— but I think I have noticed symptoms of increasing restiveness under these leading- strings on the part of the Russian. He has taken for instance on certain occasions to not making his official calls at the same time as arranged by all the other Consuls. It is diverting to study this little conflict of interests and prestige ; more especially as it might seem to represent the only silver lining to the cloud hanging over the Persian N. W. Salient—and even much of Azerbaijan. 17. I venture to think under these circumstances that it is advisable that I postpone my first tour towards Urmia, Sauj-Bulak and Rawanduz until after my Reception on the King’s Birthday. I had already arranged that during my entire absence, a Policeman be placed on night duty inside the Consulate garden. I his idea was not prompted, however, by fear of a rising here ; but from my study ef Aghabegoff’s Revelations and the fact that there have been several cases of ordinary burglary here due to distress and unemployment. 18. I may add moreover that after one single bright day (on May 22nd) there have been fierce storms and further torrential rains, such as will have rendered nearly all the minor main roads very difficult indeed to negotiate for some days to come. - May 26th, 1931 Later 19. The news from the Maku zone continues to be very disquieting, but the rumour that Maku itself had been taken has been modified. It is now said that the Kurds have only seized villages close to Maku.41 20 Sarhang Kalb-Ali Khan, commander of the 1st Tabriz Tib, left hurriedly for Maku at midday yesterday—so that the 500 men sent off in lorries last week no doubt belonged to this lib. 2 1 No more troops have been sent there now, however, as there are none to * spare. 22 A Lorry of medicines and another of stretchers was also despatched to wards Maku yesterday, while other lorries were commandeered for the despatch there of food and ammunition. 23. Severe fighting is reported to continue near Maku. Apparently about 600 Turkish Kurds were driven across the frontier by the Turks, the latter now holding the frontier and possibly having once again advanced a little way into Persia. The Persians, making a virtue of necessity, attacked them and there have been considerable losses on both sides. The 3 aeroplanes left here at 7-15 a.m. to-day in the Maku direction. It is not known whether they have brought small bombs or not: but it is believed that upon their arrival a further Persian attack will develop. But the weather again changed for the worse at about 3 p.m. when there was a miniature cloud-burst with severe hajl for an hour. Such changeable weather may interfere with air operations. 24. Ibrahimoff, mentioned in paragraph 3 above, and another “ Locust Expert ” who is believed to have beep at one time Head of Erivan Prison -left at mid-day for Bilasavar. While here these men had a police escort—ostensibly to protect them from possible reprisals by refugees. There seems, however, to be still some doubt as to these men's real names. The infiltration of Bolshevik Agents into the Mughan, Kara Dagh and Ardabil zones has grown very pronounced. 25. To sum up, I can not seriously believe that the situation at Maku need cause any special alarm ; but, as the Military Authorities themselves still seem very perturbed and as the weather remains hopeless, I do not propose to start upon my tours till after my Reception on June 3rd.

His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the sub ject of insurance in Persia, and position of British firms in general.

No. 88, dated 11th June 1931. Despatch from the Commercial Secretary, British Legation, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. Overseas Trade (B) 95, dated 11th June 1931. Mr. Gabbay, the Manager of the Roditi Mercantile Association, who as you are aware are agents for Persia of the Alliance Assurance Company, informs me that he is meetino- with growing competition from the Soviet insurance trust Gostrakli. He has just returned from Isfahan where he had hoped to persuade Kazerum to renew the fire insurance policy for £60,000 on his textile factory vhen it expires in six weeks time. He had not been able to quote less than • 046 per mi e. tos ra ' i secured the business for -033 per mille with the premium payable in three months time. As an additional inducement they persuaded the Russian Bank to increase Kazaerani’s overdraft from 20 to 100 thousand tomans. ^ s i r. ^a a} poi out, it was quite impossible to compete under such conditions. 2. Until a few months ago, he told me, he had insured all the goods exports) on which the National Bank, unlike the Imperial Bank, make ad c MC280FD43 to Persian morel ants. The Tehian office of the Bank now insures these goods through Gcstrakh—which is perhaps only natural in view of the fact that these goods are usually transported by Bureau-Perse (the Bussi^n transport organiza tion) and that Gcstrakh remit to the Bank 20 % of their commission. Moreover Mr. Gabbay is the first to admit that Costrakh are very good payers. The Alliance however, still does this class of insurance for the Besht branch of the National Bank, curiously enough. 3. Mr. Gabbay, in common with all other foreign importers, complains bitterly of the trade restrictions recently created by the Persian Government. He tells me c( n r denttdly that he proposed to liquidate the Association’s ordinary business and merely keep a small office open for his insurance work. I fear however that even this form of activity may become impossible in the near future as the Minister of Court is credited with the intention of forming an insurance company under the auspices of the National Bank to which all foreign companies operating in Persia would be bound by law to offer half their business, a form of forcible reinsurance which Mr. Gabbay considers no self respecting insurance company could agree to. The Minister of J ustice is said to be drafting a law to this effect. 4. This proposal is undoubtedly due to the belief, prevalent in both official and commercial circles, that foreign insurance companies have been making excessive profits “ at the expense of Persia ”, It is part and parcel of Teymourtache’s “ disgorge or get out ” policy of which the Company Begistration Law and the attitude adopted towards the Imperial Bank of Persia afford further illustration. Carried to absurd lengths, as it is likely to be, and coupled with difficulties in other directions, it may well result in the great majority of foreign firms closing down. 5. In fact one begins to wonder whether the Persian Government are not animated by the same short-sighted intentions in regard to foreign establishments as actuated the r l urkish Government shortly after the war. Persian Merchants, who are not badly placed to know r which way the wind is blowing, certainly lock upon the Monopoly laws as having been directed not only against the Bussians but against foreign companies in general. Managers of both British and other foreign concerns have told me that their Persian acquaintances are constantly expressing surprise that they have not yet decided to liquidate, wdiich may be considered to be a polite way of asking : “ Isn’t it high time you packed up ”. 6 .

(39) Memorandum from the British Legation, Tehran, No. 174, dated the 16th June 1931. His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the subject °f Company registration law. Despatch No. 309, to the Foreign Office, dated the 16th June 1931. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office London, No. 309, dated the 16th June 1931. 1 have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the Company Regis tration Law which was passed by the Majlis on May 24th together with a cop) of45 the regulations for the enforcement of the law. It is to apply to Persian and foreign firms equally but there are so few of the former that it can fairly be said to be aimed at the latter. 2 The chief point of interest is the registration fees laid down in Article 10 . These have been scaled down to such an extent that the Anglo-Persian ()il ( ompany will bp called unon to pay roughly one thousand pounds sterling and the Ottoman Bank six hundred pounds sterling. As the bill was originally drafted they would have had to pay one per mille or thirty thousand and five hundred pounds, respectively. The Manager of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company thinks he is largely responsible for the reduction which was eventually decided upon through the re presentations he caused to be made to the Minister of Court. 3 The original registration fee seemed so exorbitant that the Commercial Secretary asked the Minister of Court whether it was intended to drive foreign con cerns out of Persia. His Highness replied that they would certainly have to go if they refused to conform to the laws of the land but he could see nothing to prevent them establishing Persian companies, when they need only declare the capital which thev required for their Persian operations. This suggestion seems fraught with too many dangers for foreign companies of anv importance to avail themselves of it but it should be possible to form subsidiaries abroad, for the special purpose of trading in Persia, with purely nominal capital. 4 . The Imperial Bank of Persia claim exemption from this registration tax under their concession. 5 1 nsurance companies are referred to specifically in Article 8 of the Law and Articles 27 , 28 and 29 of the Regulations. In this connection I would invite your attention to my Printed Letter No. 298 of June 11th enclosing a copy of a despatch from the Commercial Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade. I have re quested the Minister for Foreign Affairs to urge on the Minister of Justice the ad visability of consulting the representatives of foreign insurance companies belore the regulations governing their activities in Persia are issued. 6 . I take it that the term “ succursales ” is not intended to cover the agencies of foreign firms (see Article 3 of the Law). This is confirmed by the interpretation ot the word “ representant ” in Article 23 of the Regulations. In fact the representa tive of one British firm (Messrs. Dunlop) thinks he can escape registration by^di vesting himself of his powers to act on behalf of his firm ; he would remain here in a purely advisory capacity and induce his dealers to place their orders in Lon on direct. 7. With regard to Article 7 of the Regulations in fin* it would not seem possible for foreign Consular Officers in Persia to legalise copies of statutes and balance s ee s that have been drawn up abroad, or of signatures of people resident a r( ^ Such legalisation would presumably have to be effected by a notary public and en certified by the nearest Persian Council. 8.

I have the honour to report that the Shah opened the Eighth Majfis on Decem ber 16th. 2. His Majesty motored in State from his private Palace to the Parliament building at 9-30 in the morning. He was welcomed at the entrance to the Majlis by the Cabinet Ministers and was accompanied to the Mirror Room where he rested for a quarter of an hour. 3. In addition to the Deputies already elected, accommodation in the House had been arranged for the Cabinet Ministers and their Assistants, the DiplonMi 0 body, persons of high rank, Merchants and Journalists. 4. At 10 a.m. His Majesty entered and read the speech from the Throne,— copy in translation of which I beg to enclose, and half an hour later the Parliament assembled in private to discuss its internal organization. 5. The first month of each fresh Parliament is spent in the verification in different committees of each member’s mandate, in electing the various comnps- sions, and in arranging the details of its internal organization and it is only after these matters have been settled that the first open session is held and the Majlis embarks on its two years’ career. 6. The Royal speech betrays the fact that His Majesty is somewhat exercised by the economic situation of the country and there must lurk a fair measure of anxiety behind the assumption that the natural aptitude and the conditions of Persia will enable it successfully to weather the storm. The remarks made in regard to the conclusion of treaties and arrangements with countries wdiose friendly feelings towards Persia are beyond doubt probably refer to Soviet Russia in the hope that a commercial agreement which has been under discussion for more than a } ear may be made on terms more favourable to Persia. 7. I am informed from a reliable source that His Majesty told Assad, the Minister for War, that the present Cabinet w r ould remain in office for the whole term of the Eighth Majlis but that it would be necessary to appoint two more Ministers in order to relieve the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Finance of t e double charge with which each is at present burdened. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch, with its enclosure to the Foreign Secre- tary to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for ’ Iraq. Translation of the Royal Speech at the opening of the Eighth Parliament at Tehran on December 16th, 1930.2 opening of that Parliament has been realised. It is OUR desire that the Eighth Majlis should go down to history as the Majlis of Economics. Happily the natural aptitude and the general conditions of the country will enable us to bring to a success ful conclusion the efforts which have to be made in order to improve the national economy. The establishment of the gold unit of currency and the conservation made of the important reserves of the national gold have been a great asset in the economic improvement. Especial attention should be paid to the prevention of waste and prodigality whether in the public disbursements or in the national revenues, to the balance of trade of the country and to the establishment of a fixed equilibrium in the national revenue and expenditure. With all foreign countries OUR relations, based on mutual friendship and res pect, are maintained. It is OUR desire that OUR Government accomplish success fully its political programme especially in regard to those countries whose friend ship with Persia is beyond doubt by concluding with them treaties and agreements which will be of great assistance to the national economy. As WE pointed out in OUR speech at the opening of the last Assembly, good morals love of country, a clear sense of duty and the strengthening of faith and piety amongst the public, merit particular attention.. WE have always been the friend and protector of those classes which love their country and desire its improve ment and progress and WE expect the National Assembly to collaborate effica ciously with the Government in cartying out the reforms mentioned, m improving general conditions and in rendering the people happy. WE invoke the assistance of Almighty God that the people’s representatives, may serve their country with success. ( 2 ) Memorandum from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 269, dated the 27th.

His Majesty’s reference to the Duzdap Railway is perhaps not without inter est as a sidelight on the prospects of the general treaty when negotiations are re sumed. At first sight it appears to show that the Persian Government are con en as to the final success of the negotiations. Coupled as it is with a reference to w a the Persian Government are pleased to consider their diplomatic victory over telegraph questions, it may, on the other hand, indicate a hope that by a po icy o procrastination Persia will be able to achieve her own desiderata piecemeal. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Govern ment of India and to His Majesty's High Commissioner for Iraq.(3) Endorsement No. 22 of 1931, dated the 10th January 1931. By His Majesty's Consul, Kerman. Copy* forwarded to :— The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, The Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain, ' ' ' The Department of Overseas Trade, London, for information. Letter from His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, to His Majesty’s Charge d'affaires, No. 1/21 of 1931, dated the 10th January 1931. I have the honour to submit the following report on the programme of road construction in S. E. Persia. 2 . In October last Prince Aijaz-us-Sultaneh, a grandson of Nasir-ud-Din Shah was appointed as Engineer in charge of roads for the whole of S. E. Persia including Lingah, Yezd and Birjand with headquarters at Kerman. Baluchistan was pre viously a separate area but has now been included in the new administration. The Prince who was educated in Russia is an intelligent person and what is more impor tant is energetic and level headed. His word apparently carries some weight £S he has already succeeded in obtaining the service of two competent road engineers- and a promise of a substantial budget allotment of over half a million Tumans. The Engineers in question (Monsieur Gaudjountzoff and Monsieur Abrahamoff) are both of Russian origin. The former is an Armenian educated in Germany who served during the war on the Galician front where he rose to the rank of Colonel, but has since adopted Persian nationality. He has just completed the survey of the Coast road from Bushire to Charbar and the proposed military road from Charbar to Bampur. His estimates for these roads are shown in an appendix to this report. He tells me that the first section to be put in hand is from Lingah to Bandar Abbas at an estimated cost of Tumans 114,000 which includes bridges but no metalling. He has recommended that the Bushire Charbar road be not touched for the present owing to the difficult nature of the country and the consequent expense which he puts at Tumans 804,000. Mons. Gaudjountzoff and Aijaz-us-Sultaneh are opposed to this alignment on account of its great expense arguing that from practical con siderations it would be better to develop the present port of Bandar Abbas and connect it with the hinterland and eventually with Khorassan by a road through Rudbar, Jiruft and Tahrud and Khabis. The advantages of this alignment would be that it is direct, meets with no formidable obstacles traverses no high passes (the Deh Bakri pass 7,700 is the highest point the road would attain) and taps the poten tially rich districts of Jiruft and Rudbar. The latter point is an important advan tage as compared with the present motor road via Tang-i-Zagh which passes-througi a bleak and inhospitable country with nothing to export. Mons. Gaudjountzoff has argued the case on the above lines to the Shah, in opposition to the Army who from sentimental and military motives would like to see the Charbar Bampur road built and at the same time develop a Persian port and attract to it the trafke which at present goes via Karachi and Duzdab. 3. The other main item in the road development policy is to establish an artery of communication between Bandar Abbas an eiian. e recen &lt;} con structed Bandar Abbas motor road is unsatisfactory as far as the Tang-i-Zagh i concerned. When this road was originally planned by British engineers m l919/ 1920 it was proposed to avoid the Tang-i-Zagh by a detour to ^ ed the existence of this alternative to Mons. Gaudjountzoff and he hopes shortly to leave for Bandar Abbas to examine it. 4 From Sir,an Northwards there are two alternative suggestions: firstly to connect Sirian by a direct link to narsinjau . , • . • rnar i xr • . the snow bound pass of Gudar-i-Surkh ; from Rafs 1 ^^^^^^ would be followed whence the track to Kas an an i 1 q f allow of heavy lorry traffic. The alternative proposal is to build a new road Sirjan to Ispahan via Shahr-i-Babak. — , No . ^ t l, 0 10th January 1931, to H. M.'s Charge d’Affaires, Tehran.5 Monsieur Gaudjountzof? complains that the Persian Government have no statistics of the movement of trade which he maintains are necessary before elabo- ratino- a road construction programme and that the road policy is governed chiefly bv national and political sentiment. For example the Government hope that the Coast road will offer an alternative and more expeditious postal route to the pre sent British India Sea service and with this object instructed the Engineers to frame estimates for a road with a ruling gradient of 1 in 20 and minimum curves of 500 metres which would allow of motor traffic at 60 kilometres an hour. Moreover, the Persian authorities have hopes that the Indian Government will bring a road down to Gwadure to link up with the terminus of the Persian road. 6 The other Engineer Mons. Abramofi is a Russian Jew with a Soviet passport. His first task is to discover an alignment for a road from Kerman to Khabis. The one he favours is that via Sirch (75 miles), which however must prove costly as there is a 10 000 feet pass to be negotiated and a fall of 7,000 feet in about 10 miles. The other alternative lies to the North (115 miles as compared to 75 via Sirch) and makes a bis detour I have been interested in this route in connection with the project outlined in my despatch No. 6/1085, dated the 4th September 1930 [Enclosure of Serial No (122) File No. 21-N/30], to the Departmtent of Overseas Trade, copy sent to H. M.’s Legation, vide my No. 1095 of the 7th idem to the Secretary m charge, Commercial Affairs, and in consequence I recently attempted tn drive a car to Khabis via Sar-i-Asiab Shish 24 B D2, Gaurud 24F A2, Gazk (24F 1)2) and Kuh Sur. I found a natural alignment, with constant slopes never exceeding 1 m 20. I drove the car to a point 8 miles N.-E. of Caz and could undoubtedly have reached the Lut if I had not the misfortune of breaking a crown wheel when negotiating a soft patch of sand. Owing to the threat of heavy rain I abandoned the attempt. 7. It would seem that the recent visit of the Shah to S.-E. Persia is the chief cause of the present activities. It is true that they have not so far advanced be yond the talking stage but undoubtedly in the next few years Khorasan will be con nected by a direct motor road to a port in the Persian Gulf which will attract to itself the bulk of the Duzdab railway traffic. In my despatch No. 6/1085 of the 4th September [Enclosure of Serial No. (122), File No. 21-N/30], 1 adumbrated this eventuality and endeavoured to show how British interests could take advantage of it. 8 .

In accordance with established practice, the Government of the day is called upon to present itself to the newly elected Mejless in order to acquaint that body with its programme and receive approval. It is also the customs for the Shah to consult with the leading Deputies and learn their views and acquaint them with His ideas as to the composition of the Cabinet. 3. Although both the Shah and the Mejless favoured the retention of office by the present Cabinet, the Prime Minister nevertheless tendered his resignation to the Shah on January 18th. This was a mere formality and was doubtless staged to impress the people with the importance of the Mejless and the Royal favour for upholding the Constitution. It, however, had the advantage of faci litating any changes in, or additions to, the Cabinet which might be required. 4. The Premier’s resignation was accordingly not accepted and he was en trusted with the formation of a fresh Cabinet which he presented to the Shah the following day. Except for one change and two additions, the new Cabinet is identical with the preceding one. The change was made in the portfolio of the Interior, to which Mirza Ali Khan Mansur, Governor General of Azerbaijan for the last three and a half years, was appointed in the place of Mirza Hussein Khan Samiyi, who it is rumoured will go to Azerbaijan as Governor General. As fore shadowed in my despatch under reference [Enclosure to Serial No. (1)], the Ministry of National Economy and the Ministry of Roads and Communications, which had been under the control of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and of finance,, received two new independent acting heads in the persons of Enayetullah Khan Samiyi and Bagher Khan Kazemi respectively. Samiyi was until recently Persian Minister in Baghdad and Kazemi was under-Secretary at the Ministry of which he is -now in charge. 5. On the 20th January the Premier introduced the Cabinet to the Mejless and outlined the Government programme in a short speech. He Jooked fomard to great progress in the domain of National Economy and said * hat tL ? touches would be put to the adoption of the gold standard. Banknotes in the currency would be issued and the Governments go reserve a used to back the gold standard. Although the economic “d toancial situation of the country was good, the Government would pay great of revenue and expenditure and would encourage e ln e , , , excellent production to the full extent of its power Allusion was made to the excellent relations existing between Persia and a1 ' f p'f“ ^ allv asked t h e Mejless to reciprocal friendship and confidence. The rr } accord its vote of confidence to his cabinet. 6. On the proposal of the President of the so that the Deputies might study the programme, T anuarv 24th.- promised for the next sitting which was to take place } - MJ38FD7. The programme was duly discussed at the next sitting and was voted unanimously. 8 . Copies of this despatch have been sent to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for ’Iraq. ( 5 ) Memorandum from His Majesty’s Legation, Tehran, No. 8, dated the 27th January 1931. His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the subject of: The British American Tobacco Company and the Persian Tobacco Monopoly. Despatch Confidential No. 44, dated the 27th January 1931, to the Foreign Office. Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d'affaires, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 44, dated the 27th January 1931. With reference to your telegram No. 3 of January , 14th I have the honour to inform you that the British American Tobacco Company have sent out an expert on their own account to investigate the value of the Persian tobacco monopoly which the Government seem prepared to concede to a foreign firm, although this step was taken on the suggestion of the Batignolles Construction Company. Mr. Acarnley, the expert in question, who appears to be the British Company's Chief Inspector in India, expresses himself in inequivocal terms on that point, although Monsieur Rouberol is endeavouring through the press to convince the public that Mr. Acarnley is here purely on account of the French company. 2. Mr. Acarnley himself is not aware of the latter’s intentions. He is only concerned, he says, with the technical side of the business, his task being to report to his principles whether or not they would be well advised to make a bid for this monopoly. He is, however, of the opinion that the Batignolles Construction Company could not hope to run the monopoly themselves, even with the help of outside capital, as they appear to be totally ignorant of all things pertaining to the cultivation and marketing of tobacco, Monsieur Rouberol’s suggestions to the Government having been of the most ex travagant character (see my despatch No. 556 of the 19th November last) (Enclosure of Serial No. (141), File No. 21-N/30]. He presumes that while Monsieur Rouberol is intent on providing the Persian Government with funds as will enable them to start railway construction in earnest, apart from the trial sections in process of completion, the French Company also expect some remuneration for their spade work from the concern which eventually takes over the tobacco company, if any : hence a clause in the initial agreement between the Persian Government and the Batignolles Construction Company to the effect that the promoters will be given shares in the company formed to operate the monopoly. 3. Mr. Acarnley is now making a tour of the principal tobacco centres. He has been to Resht, Isfahan and Shiraz and may fly to Meshed. His conclusions up-to-date appear to be as follows and I am tempted to agree with him on every point of a non-technical character :— (a) Persian tobacco being grown in the most primitive fashion from entirely degenerated seed, it has no commercial value on the European or Amercian markets. That being so the concessionnaire could only make certain of a profit from local consumption, a proposition which would be quite attractive in itself were it not for certain major obstacles mentioned below. Tobacco for export might be grown on a commercial scale but experience only could tell. The Britis American Tobacco Company have totally failed to grow good tobacco in India, in spite of efforts extending over twenty years and a ^ ar » e staff of European experts owing, I understand, to the incapability of the ryots to learn up-to-date methods of cultivation and prepara tion.(b) &lt;e) If the conoessionnaire depended on the local market for his profits, hl lT 6 T^n 16 ^ yearS ’ he would need to ^ sure of getting his profits out of the country and there is no telling how long the present exchange situation may last. The financial situation generally and the danger of a serious upheaval should the Shah die make of Persia a particularly unpromising field for capital investment. Moreover, although the possibility of a Kussian invasion is perhaps remote, it should nevertheless be noted that in such an eventuality the province of Gilan, in whic the concessionnaire s interests would be centred, would probably be the first to be overrun. (d) Were the concessionnaires to agree to pay the Persian Government its royalty in a lump sum in advance he could no longer count on effec tive official assistance, whereas he would undoubtedly be unpopular and have to meet with concerted resistance on the part of the Persian interests adversely affected by the monopoly, including those Gov ernment employees, growers and traders who live by defrauding the Exchequer and who would object to a stricter form of control as exercised by a foreign company. 4. W r ith reference to this last paragraph it is, I think, particularly interesting to note that the Persian Government have hinted that they would like to raise two million pounds on the tobacco monopoly and that this is the very amount which they consider they still need to carry through their currency reform. Moreover, Teymourtache, in his latest discussion with the representative of the Swedish Match Company, told him that the Government, if they granted a match mono poly, might wish to reserve to themselves the right of demanding at any time the payment of the royalty due for every year of the concession in advance—a condi tion which Major Carlberg, after reference to Mr. Kruger, informed His Highness was quite out of the question. 5. The Persian Government, therefore, although they would probably claim that such advance payments did not constitute loans, seem to have come round in favour of what is commonly called a loan policy. We know that they have given serious thought to the possibility of raising capital from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in exactly the same way. It is perhaps the realisation that they need the oil royalty in its entirety to balance the trade of the country and thereby support the exchange market that has led them to apply this principle to other potential sources of revenue. 6. There has been no need for this Legation to afford Mr. Acarnley anything more than a very general form of assistance. In fact this assistance tas been confined to the advice and information given to him b y tl ' e Co “ me r“ ?y® t j i j ! ' and His Majesty’s Consular Officers in the provinces which he has elected to visit, 7.

With reference to your despatch Nm ^ panted his letters have the honour to report that Monsieur p s Soviet Ambassador on the 4th instant ' called on him on the 8 th instant. 2. After receiving the customary notification 1 more a t home in lis French is quite fluent although he info that he found it human . He slid that it was his XTas loling tffi^rvices of two or three mvel but interesting. He regretted tha Military Attache) as their nembers of his staff (including the Counsellor and the yexperience would have been useful to him. He also spoke to me of his wife’s musical proclivities and of his children who have lost no time in starting their labours at the Soviet School. 3. Our conversation was interrupted by the somewhat unexpected arrival of Teymourtache (presumably also paying a call). We all three discussed the opening of the Persian Exhibition in London—a useful topic in the circumstances—until I made my departure. 4. The new Ambassador gave me the impression of being a quiet and pleasant spoken individual, rather lost in his present surroundings. I should doubt his being fitted for the role which he may be expected to play here. He informed me when returning my call that the new Counsellor would be the Director of the Central Asian Section at the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 5. I enclose translation of the speeches exchanged on the 4th instant. It will be observed that though the Ambassador referred especially to the Treaties govern ing the relations between the two countries the Shah’s reply is couched in more vague and general terms.. Copy. From the Shafagh-i-Surkh, January 7th, 1931. Translation. The Kussian Ambasador had an audience in the Gulistan Palace with His Majesty the Shah in the morning of Sunday last (January 4th) when he made the following speech while submitting his credentials :— Sire, I have the honour to submit with the greatest respect the letter of recall of my predecessor, Citizen Davtian, and my own credentials by which the Central Executive Committee of the U. S. S. K. has appointed me Ambassador Extraord- nary at the Court of Your Imperial Majesty. The friendly relations existing for many years between the U. S. S. K. and Persia are based on the Russo-Persian Treaty of February 26th, 1921, which put an end to the Tsarist policy in Persia and opened up in the relations between the two countries a new era based on a spirit of complete equality and reciprocal con fidence. These ties of friendship which continued to grow stronger as the years- passed by were established between the U. S. S. R. and Persia in the course of a series of treaties which possess international importance such as the Treaty of Neutrality of October 1st, 1927 and by other agreements signed at the same time regarding most important questions touching the economic relations of both countries. My whole endeavour at this juncture will be to safeguard the strengthen ing and the extension of the ties of friendship between the U. S. S. R. and Persia and above all to further our commercial relations and other economic matters. I feel confident that the difficulties anticipated in this connection will be re moved through the good will of both Governments which have a mutual interest in the question. The confidence of succeeding in solving the questions entrusted to me by my Government comes to me from the sincere efforts I shall make to carry out the principles of the Russo-Persian Treaty of 1921 and the Treaty of Neutrality of 1927. I hope that Your Imperial Majesty and Yopr Majesty’s Government will afford me in these efforts their complete and sincere co-operation. When the Ambassador’s speech came to an end, the Shah made the following speech : Monsieur 1’Ambassadeur, We receive with the utmost pleasure the letters of the Central Executive ( om- mittee of the U. S. S. R. one of which introduces you as their Extraordinary Ambas sador at our Court and the other recalls your predecessor. Your statements regarding the strengthening of friendship and the extension of the commercial and economic relations between Persia and the U. S. S. R. have caused us the greatest pleasure and we have great hope that with the goodwill ofthe U. S. Eh It. and through your good offices successful results will he achieved for both our (governments from which our two countries will greatly benefit. This Will be .to the gratification of our heartfelt desire and in accordance with the ^continual exertions of our Government in its endeavour to consohdate the ties of friendship and good-neighbourhood and to enhance the commercial and economic relations between the two countries. \\ e assure you that our unstinted support and onr Government’s co-operation will be accorded you in the happy fulfilment of the important mission entrusted \o you. — JY) Memorandum from His Majesty's Legation, Tehran, No, 267, dated the 24th December 1930. His Britannic Majesty’s Bepresentative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the subject of tea cultivation in Gilan. Reference :—Tehran Printed letter No. 176, dated September I 3 th, 1930 {(Serial No. 121 , File No. 21-N./30.) Mr. Lingeinan's despatch No. Overseas Trade (B) 190, dated December 24, 1930, to the Department of Overseas Trade. Copy to His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Resht, under Printed letter No. 37 of December 24, 1930. Despatch from His Majesty’s Legation, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. Overseas Trade (B) 190, dated the 24th December 1930. I availed myself of my recent journey to Gilan to visit some of the tea gardens lying outside the wonderfully attractive village of Lahidjan, situated some 28 miles East of Resht, and was much struck by the development which this new industry is obviously undergoing, and also by the progressive policy followed by the Persian Government. I was shown round by Monsieur Protiva who is in charge and who had obviously benefited appreciably by his study of tea cultiva tion in Ceylon and the Far East. , 2. The example set by the Government in establishing a model garden of thirty hectares in Lahidjan seems to be having happy results, 160 hectares having been brought under tea cultivation in the last two years, thus bringing the total area under tea to 600 hectares—of which not more than 50 represent gardens between 15 and 20 years old—with a total production of 40,000 kilos. The peasants are also learing to take better care of their gardens and generally speaking to adopt a less short sighted policy in the matter of pruning and picking, although the struggle towards enlightenment is necessarily a hard one when one has to deal with such ignorant people. 3. The Government aim at bringing 6,000 hectares under production m the space of the next ten years which they calculate should suffii* to meet half the million) '''iromler ^prosecute this ambitious pro gramme they this ably not more than half will ever be paid accuiumg ^ he considers enough at the moment. 1 The main item ^ ^,3'“ fiVS Gilan and Mazanderan.

The Government is also putting up a small factory for the drying and curing' of all the tea produced in Lahidjan, the machinery for which (valued at £3,0001 was made by Messrs. Marshall, not by a Dutch firm as previously reported. 6. It is estimated that the initial expenditure incurred before the bushes begin to yield in the fourth year is 350 Tomans per hectare, or 450 Tomans if there has been a dry enough summer to make picking impossible before the fifth year, fn Monsieur Protiva’s opinion this is no serious obstacle in a province where the pea sants are used to wait a number of years for their mulberry trees to become pro ductive and he is confident that private landowners will perhaps slowly but, sureh^ realize the advantages of taking up tea cultivation in lieu of the crops which are now dependent on Kussia for their market, all the more that those among the exist ing gardens which are well cared for appear to give a very encouraging return on the capital invested. 7. Most of the existing plants are from Chinese seed acclimatized in Ceylon but experiments are being conducted with Manipuri (Indian) seed, which however seems to suffer from frost y better results being obtained from a China-Batum hybrid. 8. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Govern ment of India and His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Resht. ( 8 ) Memorandum from His Majesty^s Legation, Tehran, No. 28, dated the 25th February 1931. His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the subject of:—Basis of contract in respect of Persian Tobacco Monopoly. Reference :—Tehran No. 8 of 27th January 1931 (Serial No. 5).. To the Foreign Office, No. 63 of 25th February 1931. Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehrak, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 83, dated the 25th February 1931. In continuation of my despatch No. 44 of January 27th last (Enclosure of Serial No. (5)] I have the honour to inform you that Mr. Acarnley, the representative of the British American Tobacco Company, left Tehran on February 12th for Baghdad where he had business with the Iraq Government. He said that after some two or three weeks in Iraq he would return to London to report personally on the results of. his mission to Persia. Before his departure he was granted an interview by the Minister of Court, at which His Highness invited the Commercial Secretary to be present. 2 . Shortly after the discussion on the prospects of a Tobacco Monopoly had opened, His Highness was handed a document containing the recommenda tions of a commission formed by the Minister of Finance, under the chairmanship of Hu: sein Quli Khan Nawab, to study the basis of the contract to be signed between the Per,- ian Government and the operating Company. His Highness remarked that it was the first he had seen of this report , which in no way bound the Government I have since been able to obtain the attached copy—and he did not propose to read through it there and then, in extenso ; he would, however, like to know what Mr. Acarnley thought about it. 3. Mr. Acarnley, who had attended all the meetings of this commission, stated that he was in agreement with its findings, with two exceptions :— (a) He was very doubtful whether his principals would be prepared to make a loan to the Persian Government under any circumstances, but lie was positive that they would not subscribe to the condition laid down in Article IT. This condition, it will be noted, is very similar to that recently suggested to and turned down by the Swedish Mate Company (see paragraph 4 of my despatch under reference)-r* jW n [Enclosure of Serial No. (5)]. Yet Teymourtache pretended he did not know that the question of this advance-he disliked the term loan -had even been raised. The Government did not insist upon such an advance and Mr. Acarnley might leave it out p &lt;:onS1 . ,:,f f l&lt;in ' tjmself, His Highness added, realised that 1 ersia had not yet learnt to spend money; he was averse, therefore, to raising extraordinary funds, particularly when the process amounted to a hypothecation of future revenue ; what Persia needed was a steady revenue—a momentous statement which ill accords with the reports which have been reaching this Legation of iate. 1 he 1 ersian -Government, however, cannot be said to have any well denned financial policy as yet. (b) Mr. Acarnley also thought Article 13 impracticable. No Company could work properly under the perpetual threat of having its contract resiliated at a year’s notice. It was in the interests of the Govern- ment itself that it should have full security. Teymourtache recog nized he force of this argument and suggested, as an alternative, that the contract should be open to revision, after say, eight years. 4. Mr. Acarnley added that, although he saw nothing else to which he could take exception, in this draft contract, he must emphasise the fact that the success of the operating Company must very much depend on the degree of intiative and freedom from bureaucratic and other vexatious restrictions which it was allowed. 5. Other interesting points in the enclosure to this despatch to which I would invite your attention are :— Article 7. —The initial capital of Five hundred thousand pounds. £500,000. Article 8. —The division of the profits in the ratio of ninety to the Govern ment and ten to the Company in the case of the local markets, and eighty to the Government and twenty to the Company in the case of exports. Article 74.—The mention of the Batignolles Construction Company to please ' Monsieur Rouberol. Article 15. —The method of arbitration proposed, including, in case of need the appointment by the President of the International Court of Justice of a sur-arbitre from among the members of the Court of Arbitration itself. Article 18. —The manufacture, inland sale and export of tobacco to be free after the payment of the banderols tax. (Private dealers, how ever, would find it very difficult to compete with the operating Com pany in view of the latter’s scientific methods and up to date machi nery.) Articles 20 and 27.—Give the Company the sole right to import cigarette paper and tobacco in all its forms. Article 26.—The Minister of Court was very insistent that the Government should be assured of a minimum yearly revenue payable in foreign currency, a stipulation which would probably cause some difficulty* 6. Mr. Lingeman, at the close of the interview, asked His Highness whether he anticipated any opposition from the Russian quarter in the e\ent of British capital being invested in North Persia. Teymourtache did not see wny the Russians should object, although he was forced to admit that there had been considerable Russian opposition to the lease by the Persian Government of its fishery rights in the Caspian to an Azer American group, for twenty years Mr. Lingeman under - stood him to say. That opposition had finally been overcome, however, and the Persian Government hoped to obtain twice as much revenue from the Americans as it had done from its partnership with the Russians. I am seeking fuitkei imoi- mation on this agreement which, so far, only appears to amount to an accord de principe. %16 three hundred and seventy-three million, two hundred and seventy-three thous and, four hundred and fifty-eight (Krans 373,273,458)—representing an increase of Krans twenty million, two hundred and eighty-five thousand, six hundred and eighty-two (Krans 20,285,682), when compared with the 1309 figures. The budget, therefore, has been balanced to all intents and purposes but the measure of reliance to be placed in these estimates still remains as doubtful as ever, no figures being available for the actual revenue and expenditure of the last two years. 3. The oil royalty, the Sugar and Tea Monopoly fund, and that part of the road receipts which are expended on road construction and upkeep are, as usual, left out of consideration. 4. On the revenue side, the only points to which I need draw your attention are an anticipated fall in the Customs receipts amounting to 21- 3 million Krans, due to the contraction in imports which is to result from the Foreign Trade Mono poly recently instituted by the Government; the inclusion of what would appear to be five million tomans (Krans 50,000,000) of bad debts under the title of Government claims (section 9) ; and a mysterious item entitled “ eventual receipts ” and amount ing to 15 • 5 million Krans, which may have something to do with the replacement of the present silver currency by a token coin. 5. The most interesting feature on the expenditure side is undoubtedly the increase of ten million Krans (Krans 10,000,000) in the general budget of the Minis try of War, including this time the arsenal and air force, a good part of which is to be devoted, I understand, to the completion of the powder factory at Pachin, near Veramin. The sum allotted to the expenses of naval and military students abroad also shows a surprising increase, from six hundred and seventy-three thousand (Krans 673,000) to four million, three hundred and thirty nine thousand, nine hundred and eighty Krans (Krans 4,339,980) while 23-4 million Krans are set aside for the purchase of ships as compared with eight million (Krans 8,000,000) the year before. The Ministry of War now appears to be charged with the purchase of this ‘ preventive navy ’ instead of the Ministry of National Economics. The budgets of the Ministries of Justice and National Economics (including the special appropriation for economic institutions) have been cut down by 2 • 8 and 5 • 7 million Krans respectively, while that of the Mmistry of Public Instruction has been in creased by 1-4 million Krans. Finally, the National Bank and its,agricultural offshoot are once more credited with five million Krans (Krans 5,\000,000) apiece to add to their capital. 6. The uncertainty regarding the fate of the local currency must have made it harder than usual to prepare this budget, but the Minister of Court, who undertook the task, seems to have got over the difficulty by including “ pahlavis ’ in his computations. 7. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Government of India, and to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for ’Iraq, ( 10 ) Memo, from His Majesty’s Legation, Tehran, No. 62, dated the 7th April 1931.

I have the honour, on instructions from His Britannic Majesty’s Principal Sec retary of State for Foreign Affairs, to inform Your Highness that the Greek Govern* mcnt have officially requested His Majesty’s Government to take charge of Greekinterests in Persia. They have also, I understand, brought their intention to the notice both of Pour Highness Government and to the French Government, which latter have in recent years been in charge of the interests concerned. 2. PTis Britannique Majesty s Government have acceded to this request, and I should consequently be grateful if Your Highness would be so good as to take note, and cause the competent authorities of the Imperial Government to be noti fied, that on May 1st next this Legation and His Britannique Majesty’s Consular Officers in Persia will assume charge of the interests of Greek nationals throughout the country. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Highness the assurance of my highest consideration. (H) Memo, from His Majesty’s Legation, Tehran, No. 64, dated the 8th April 1931. His Britannique Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned below on the subject of Audiences with His Majesty the Shah and use of interpreters :— Despatch to the Foreign Office, No. 152, dated the 8th April 1931. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 152, dated the 8th April 1931. You will recollect that at my audience with the Shah before proceeding on leave last October, I was informed by the Minister of Court that the Minister for Foreign Affairs would act as interpreter on that occasion and that consequently there was no need for me to bring Mr. Havard, my Oriental Secretary. 2. Yesterday evening after the Minister of Court had proposed the solution of the Military Attache incident which I had the honour to report in my telegram No. 66, of April 7th, I said that in the event of your accepting this solution and my having an audience next week with the Shah, I should like to bring Mr. Havard with me as interpreter. I told him frankly that I had not been at all satisfied with Feroughi as interpreter on the occasion of my last audience. I was convinced that Feroughi, who w^as very nervous, had not correctly repeated to His Majesty what I had said. 3. Teymourtache regretted that I had not been satisfied with Feroughi as inter preter, but wns not altogether surprised as he said that Feroughi, in addition to being very nervous, had a bad memory. He added that he would be happy to otter his own services, although he disliked interpreting and never did so now. He was afraid that His Majesty would not agree to my bringing Mr. Hayard as a aefinite rule existed that no foreign interpreters were a owed and it would not be possible to make an exception. The rule applied equally to the Russian Embassy. 4. In these circumstances I had no alternative to accepting the Minister of Court’s offer. His Highness is in any case an exceJlent interpreter and the onty^^ in this country who would have the courage to repeat to the . Sll n a N u p X * e ' u ite marks which he might be asked to interpret. He acted as interpreterfo r me q satisfactorily when I had an audience of His i ' l .i c y . v 111 e P ., , . „ ce ll t P. Loraine in reporting his farewell audience m 192b pays a tribute to the excellent manner in which Teymourtache interpreted on that occasion. 5.

Lei i hR from His ^Majesty s Consul, Kerman, to the Department of Overseas Trade, 3,&gt;, Old Queen Street, London, No. 6/1085, dated the 4th September 1930. In accordance with instructions from the Officer-in-charge Commercial Affairs, H. B. M.’s Legation, Tehran, I have the honour to submit the following amplified note regarding the proposed direct motor road across the Lut from Kerman to Meshed, supplementary to the report forwarded to you by Mr. Lingeman under cover of his despatch B.-54 of May 16th, 1930s The attached sketch* map will show the alternative alignments and the great saving in distance that will be affected. The question of this road has interested me because I can see in it a possible means of introducing lorries of British manufacture on to the Persian market at present the preserve of the cheap American lorry. To show how such a desirable consummation is possible, requires a brief explanation of the previous history of the project and the physical difficulties to be encountered. The original aligr ment in which the Russians were interested is shown on the sketch map in red. The river, which has to be crossed at Gudar Barut cannot be forded and therefore requires a bridge, the construction of which must be costly owing to the inhospitable surroundings and the nature of the subsoil which demands deep substantial piers. There is, however, an alterna tive alignment marked in black and lettered B invloving no river crossing and which is at present used by camels. This track lies over a saltpan into which camels are said to sink in places to a depth ol a foot or so and which cannot be negotiated by any four wheel lorry and has therefore not been considered as an alternative alignment to that through Gildar-i- Barut. I have, however, reason to believe that the six-wheeler lorry—a type of vehicle m which Great Britain holas an acknowledged supremacy, would be able to negotiate the 20 to 30 miles of salt with comparative case. If therefore, a British firm could be induced to put two or three six-wheelers on this route, they would have a monopoly of the steady pilgrim traffic in both directions and would also be able to carry dates, fruit and grain at fairly remunerative rates. As already stated there would be no competition from American four-wheelers and it is very unlikely that the Persian Govern ment would embark on the difficult construction of an expensive bn ge when an alternative route costing nothing was already m existence. As regards the alignment from Kerman to Khabis, I have reason to believe that that marked C could be made passable for a six-wheeler at a compara tively small cost. It will be understood that there is a good deal of conjecture in this proposition. I was not going to put it up officially, till I had tried it out, H it had not been for Mr. Lingeman’s instructions to submit a^turther reporl. I own a Morris six-wheeler and I had proposed to try i ov r &gt; B and C in the autumn as soon as the weather became reasonably cool Unfortunately, however, the six-wheeler in questions caught fir, a short * Not printed. 792(0 i’&amp;PD r.

I shall therefore be reduced to trying the route on horse back, which will not be the same thing but will, I hope, enable me to form some conclusion as to the practical possibility of the project. I understand that it is not clear to the Department ot Overseas Trade how the route will traverse the waterless corner of the Dasht-i-Lut. It will be seen from the sketch map that the section involved in which water will not be available is only 60 miles in length. There are many other desert routes such as the Baghdad Damascus, which are in regular use and on which water cannot be obtained for very much longer stretches, I attach some statistics regarding the movements of merchandise and passengers together with a summary of the freight and tariff now in opera tion. At this stage it would be premature to examine the question of how the service would be financed and run. Another important aspect of the question is in connection with the possible dismantlement of the Duzdab Railway. If this line disappears railhead will presumably be brought back to Nushki and the present British Indian import trade of 7,000 tons per annum will have to be carried for 945 miles by lorry instead of the present 588. This must prove a handicap vis d vis Russian trade and the question arises of an alternative route. Before the construction of the Duzdab Railway Meshed imported the bulk of its requirements not of Russian origin by the caravan route through Bandar Abbas and Rawer. At the beginning of the War when Russia could no longer supply goods, trade by this route increased enormously. It is interesting to note that in the report on the Economic Conditions in Persia issued by the Department of Overseas Trade in March 1930, it is stated that importers in Meshed tend to revert to their former practice oi importing vid Baghdad or the Gulf Ports through Tehran, the time taken being often greater and the difference in price small. If trade already tends to desert the Duzdap route in favour of that vid Bushire of Baghdad, this tendency will be all the more increased if a direct motor road through Kerman were opened up. It must be remembered that freight rates on the Duzdap Railway do not show such a great saving in motor transport as might at first be supposed. 2d a ten mile is an average figure as com pared to id a ten mile by lorry. With rail-head at Nushki Meshed would be 945 miles by road and 635 miles by rail from Karachi and freight rate would thus be £21 a ton. From Bandar Abbas the distance byroad would be 930 miles which at Ad a ten mile would give a rate £15/10 a ton. Ocean freight to Bandar Abbas is, it is true, 25 per cent, higher than to Karachi but with an increased volume of trade, it might be reduced n not brought down to the Karachi level. Another important advantage attached to a route vid Bandar Abbas and Kerman would be the avoidance of the 1/16 Customs transit dues, cheaper port charges. One Customs House to pass thiough instead of two, and only one break in bulk. The opening of the Kerman to Meshed road should not be of much benefit to Russian trade as it could not compete in cheapness with sea transport from Odessa to Bandar Abbas.

The imports via Duzdap Railway may be put at 7,000 tons and the exports at 3,000 tons a year. Probably about 75 per cent, of this trade appertains to Birjand and Meshed, which would therefore be diverted to the Bandar Abbas route. Merchandise (Local Traffic). Khabis and the neighbourhood exports about 800 tons of dates chiefly to Khorasan and Afghanistan and takes approximately an equal quantity of grain in exchange. The transport of the bulk of this produce could be secured at a rate of about 3d. to 4d. a ton mile.

With reference to Mr. Monypenny’s telegram No. 19 of the 27th June last and paragraph 76 of this consulate’s Diary for June 1930, I have the honour to report that, as a consequence of certain accusations made by the Persian military authorities against the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in connexion with the operations against the Boir Ahmadi, the Resident Director, Mr. T. L. Jacks, visited Khuzistan from the 24th to the 29th August last, and paid a personal visit to the Company’s Southern Area. 2. Mr. Jacks informed me in conversation that the Persian authorities in Tehran, acting on information from the military headqurters in Ears, had accused the Company’s employees of intriguing with the tribes against which operations are now being conducted, and, when pressed for details, alleged that Mr. Carter of the Southern Area staff had conveyed to the tribes infor mation contained in telegrams as to military movements. 3. Considering that the Company’s employees have sustained personal sufiering and loss on more than one occasion through the raids of these tribes, and could have nothing to gain by their encouragement, the accusa tion has a primd facie absurdity. But, as a precise charge has been levelled, Mr. Jacks thought it worthwhile to demonstrate its truth or falsehood by personal investigation. 4. His enquiries show fairly clearly that the source of the whole incident was the officer in command of the detachment at Mishun, Naib III. Abdullah Khan, it is a year or more since the Company’s headquarters in this area were moved forward from Mishun to Gach-i-Qara Guli, some 3t&gt; miles further up-country. Since then the Company has unsuccessfuly tried to induce the Naib to advance his headquarters in conformity, in order to be in closer touch with the* drilling camp at Gach-i-Pokak, which lies still further towards the Boir Ahmedi centre. All that he would do for Gach-i-Pokak was to multiply the number of locally re cruited “ tufangchis ” who are no more than a camp police to prevent larceny, etc., who are paid by the Company, and in whose pay the officer was probably interested ; and this in spite of the fact that for some while before the raid of June 25th took place, rumours of it were about the country side. Another matter was that the Company moved its ice plant this summer from Mishun to Gach-i-Qara Guli, and the Naib was infoimed that in consequence he could no longer be supplied with ice at Mishun ; this incensed him greatly, so that he is reported to have been heard to say that “ he would make it dearer for the Company than their ice ”. For fourteen months this officer had not been inspected from Behbehan. 5. A few weeks ago the officer in command at Behbehan, Yawar Nasiri Guli Khan, was taken under arrest to Tehran. The information lodged against Mr. Carter, presumably originated from Naib Abdullah Khan, and, there not being a scrap of evidence to support it, it seems clear that it was due entirely to the situation outlined in the preceding paragraph, on account of which, scenting possible trouble for himself as a sequel to his superior officer’s arrest, he endeavoured to forestall calamity by putting the boot on to some one else’s leg. 6 . Mr. Jacks, to whom I am indebted for most of the above information stated that he had acquainted you with the situation as it stood when he left Tehran, and I have no doubt that he will already have informed you fully of what I have recounted above. I therefore delaj'ed the composition of this despatch, in case any local development occurred, which does not so far appear to be so. 7.

Customs statistics are notably unreliable but it is interesting to note that Colonel Biscoe’s information points to an appreciable decrease in the smuggling from the Arab to the Persian side of the Gulf, a traffic which has undoubtedly contributed very largely to the prospeiity of the Arab coast in the past. 3. I agree with Colonel Biscoe that it would be advantageous for him to be accompanied by Mr. Probationer Vice Consul Blanch on his forthcoming tour of the Arab ports, and I should be grateful if I might be informed as soon as possible by telegraph whether the suggestion meets with your approval. 4.

Letter from Officer i/c Commercial Affairs, British Legation', Tehran, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. C.

A study of the imports of these Arab during the last six or seven years, so as to include the two years prior L introduction of the Persian Sugar and Tea Monopoly in May 1925, should -rive a valuable indication of the rapid increase in smuggling from the Arab to the Persian side of the Gulf. I am unaware however whether goods intended for Persian consumption are invariably declared on entry into the Arab ports prior to transhipment. .. T shoul d also be glad to learn whether in your opinion the prosperity of the Arab side of the Gulf, and therefore its power to purchase British mods does not very much depend on the continuance of causes which now make smuggling into Persia so extremely profitable- 4, Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade. 792(C) F&amp;PD147 Letter prom His Majesty’s Consulate Political Resident in the Persian Gulp, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 134/2079, DATED THE 10TH SEPTEMBER 1930. With reference to paragraphs 2 and 3 of letter No. C. A. 6/IA., of May ^ 2nd last from the Officer - !n.'charge of Commercial Affairs, the enclosed tables giving in the one case the value of total imports as well as those of tea and sugar, for Bahrein, Kuwait and Muscat during the years 1922-23 to 1928-29, and in the other, the actual percentage of total imports represented by tea and sugar, will I think be of interest to you. o These figures show that practically no smuggling now takes place froineither Kuwait or Muscat a fact which is confirmed by reports I have received from both places. 3. As regards Bahrein, there has been a fairly active contraband trade across the Gulf to Persia of recent years but I am told that this is on the decrease owing to the increasing difficulty of getting cargoes from the coast into the interior; in any case there is no justification for the assumption that the whole prospenty of these Islands is attributable to smuggling the figure show that in Bahrein’s average yearly iniporrs of close on £2,000,000 sugar and tea account for but £100,000. Hardly a vital factor or prospenty even if it were all smuggled into Persia, which ot course it is not. 4. It must be realised that Behrein is becoming to an increasing extent the entrepot for Nejd and the greater part of North Eastern Arabia, and that this port has lately, for reasons which it is not necessary to enter into here, to a very considerable degree usurped the position formerly held by Kuwait, and a large part of her tea and sugar imports go to supply the needs of the interior of Arabia. This accounts for the increase in sugar and tea imports of recent years, probably more than smuggling. 5. In any review of the economic condition of the Arab Coast, the only factor which really need'be considered is the Pearl industry. Bahrein ; done exports annually* some H to 2 million pounds worth of pearls, probably more, since pearls are always undervalued, and in good years the expor may actually amount to as much as £5,000,000. In my opinion smuggling from Bahrein carried on in the main by Persian merchants—cannot in tne light of the facts be considered to constitute more than an unimportant ana spasmodic trade, or which the extent is apt to be considerably exagger Ae on account of its notorious character and imaginative appeal. 6. While the present moment, owing to the slump in the pearl market, is not particularly opportune for the development of British Trade on c Arab Coast, it is to be hoped that in the ordinary course, conditions w ^ shortly improve and it would seem desirable to carry out a general P re . inl ! nary survey of the market so that when the purchasing power of the a principalities is regained, British and Indian merchants may be rea y o profit by it. 7. I would therefore suggest if you see no objection, that Mr. Blanch should accompany me on a tour of the Arab ports which I propost . undertake in the “ Patrick Stewart ” about the end of October, a g approximately 3 weeks or a month. He could collect information ro ^ Political Agents, ipade personal enquiries from local Indian an r , firms and would be more qualified at the end of the tour to re Pv - n a enquiries from the Department of Overseas Trade, etc., and would o wider outlook of trade possibilities in the Persian Gulf. 8. As Mr. Blanch will be transported free of charge no additional cost will be involved. 9.

Despatch to the Foreign Office, No. 619, dated the 22nd October 1930. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 519, dated the 22nd October 1930. I have the honour to report with reference to my despatch No. 494 of the 7th October that Doctor Schniewind is leaving Tehran this week on the conclusion of hia two years contract with the Persian Government as Financial Adviser. 2. Doctor Schniewind told me that he had been more than once sounded recently as to whether he would accept a renewal of his contract. He had replied in each case that he could only contemplate a renewal on condition that he was given executive authority. As it was he had tendered advice149 to the best of his abilities in financial matters. Not only had his advice almost invariably been disregarded but in many cases the Persian Govern ment had deliberately done exactly the opposite of what he had suggested. He mentioned especially the gold currency law to which he was entirely - opposed in its present form—in fact he considered it quite impracticable and also the present exchange control law which was merely paralysing the trade of the country and giving opportunities for illicit profits to highly placed officials. 3. I asked whether he was going to be received in audience before his departure. To my surprise he said that he had never had an audience of the Shah. He had twice raised the question of an audience, once through the German Minister and once through the Prime Minister. On each occa sion the Minister of Court hod blocked it and he was convinced that Teymourtache had done this for fear that he (Doctor Schnicwind) might tell His Majesty some home truths which would not be flattering to those ies- ponsible for the present economic policy of the country. 4. In the course of our conversation he told me that he had some time ago drawn the attention of the Government to the so-called tobacco mono poly and had pointed out that if a State controlled monopoly company was formed and honestly administered the profits to the Treasury from this source would be enormously increased. As it was the tobacco merchants were making some five million tomans a year profit. Doctor Schniewind’s proposal was under consideration when suddenly it was made known that no change could be made, as it was considered that the Monopoly was work ing satisfactorily and the profits to the Government steadily if slowly increasing. The explanation of this was, said Doctor Schniewind that after some hard bargaining the tobacco merchants had squared the Minister of Court for sixty-five thousand tomans. Doctor Schniewind gave me the above as a statement of fact and added that nothing could to-day be put through without a large douceur being made to Teymourtache and his utterly corrupt and unscrupulous henchman, Diba. And so ends one more chapter in the history of Advisers to the Persian Government. 4. I need hardly add that Doctor Schniewind is leaving without the smallest mark of gratitude or recognition from the Persians. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.

I I have the honour to report that the Shah received me in audience this morning. His Highness Feroughi, the Minister for Foreign Affairs acted as interpreter. This, as I have already reported, is a break with the past as on such occasions the Oriental Secretary has always hitherto accompanied His Majesty’s Minister as interpreter to audiences with His Imperial Majesty*150 Fcroug i d not strike me as a good interpreter and I should at least have preferred Teym urtache who on a previous occasion in the absence of the Oriental Secretary appeared to me to have interpreted accurately and well. But Feroughi is of that timid type who would always try to avoid saying anything unpalatable to His Majesty. ^ 6 , 2 V I ^fu n u y n enq \ Utln ? a i fter His Ma j est y’ s health and expressed the hope that it he had not entirely recovered from the attack of influenza from which he was suffering in the early part of the month, his approaching journey, to Hast Persia would completely restore his health. His Majesty replied that he feit very much better and that he had always found his autumn journey to outlying parts of his Dominions beneficial to his health. I asked if His Majesty intended to visit Baluchistan after his visit to Meshed He replied that he certainly hoped to go as far South as Duzdap but that he doubted penetrating into Baluchistan on account of the climate at that time of the year. He had not yet decided which way he would return whether viu Meshed or across the Lut desert via Kerman, Yezd and Isfahan. He was leaving next week and expected to be absent about six weeks. 3. Hrs Majesty then enquired by which route I intended to return to England and when 1 said I hoped to go through ’Iraq by the new route via Mosul and Nlsibin he made some flattering remarks about the progress made by ’Irrq in recent years and the development of communications in that country. He then spoke with gieat earnestness about the Nowanduz Head and said it was a great disappointment to Persia that this road would not be completed as early as he had hoped. I asked Feronghi to say to His Majesty—but I will not guarantee that he repeated accurately what I had said—that the question of the Rowanduz Ro id has been on the tapis more or less since I came to Persia four years ago but that it was only within the last year that the Persians appeared to have taken the matter seriously ; moreover they seemed to make little allowance for the fact that the constructional work on the ’Iraq side of the frontier was far more difficult and much more expensive than on the Persian sid . Iraq like every other country in the world was suffering from the universal financial and economic stringency and were bound to economise wherever they could. While, therefore, there was no question of ’Iraq not completing their work on the road eventually they could not be expected to accelerate construction unduly in view of the heavy cost involved. His Majesty asked why they could not borrow the money if necessary to complete the road quickly. I said I was not in a position to express any opinion on the subject of ’Iraq’s financial commitments. 4 His M desty then asked whether it was true that railway and a pipe ne was going to be built from Baghdad to Haifa. I said that I believed his matfer hid been under discussion for two or three years. I added ointedly, though again I cannot guarantee that Feroughi accurately iterpreted what I said, that as the question of the railway and pipe line ’ould involve a large expenditure of money, the most careful and detailed stirr ates were being made after consultation with the best engineering firms efore any decision would be taken on such a big project. 5 His Majesty then enquired as to the prospects of oil production in raq I su'd that there were rich and productive oilfields m Iraq but their evc'opment must obviously depend on the question of transport to the r I understood, however, that thewhoiequesUorofod Potion was ecoming more and more a q^stion of —VTr £ seating excessive and w^tetul p o^ ^ ^ ^ Cadmsn wa3 ossible, the £ S “‘r t on this question and I believed that by periodical dmutediy a great exp ^ eountry ’ s g rea t oil producing isits to America he kp, ^ rc , sf0 nded by speaking in the highest terms ^mpan s.

We then passed to the forthcoming Persi n Exhibition in London. I said that the action of His Majesty in allowing not only certain of the State treasures but also valuable objects from his own personal collection to be sent to London was most highly appreciated by the authorities of the Exhibition. His Majesty spoke very modestly of the exhibits from Persia and said he would have liked these two have been far more representative but many private owners in Persia had been unwilling to send their trea sures. He then said he thought it was a pity that room could not be found for a section of modern Persian art. He cited in particular the new famous Khorasan carpets which are made in Meshed to-day and which are admittedly of as fine a texture and craftsmanship as any of the ancient Persian rugs. He mentioned also modern Persian silver-work and brass- work. Whfie admitting the excellent workmanship of these modern Persian crafts I expressed no opinion as to whether the Committee of the Exhibition could find room for them at Burlington House ; I understand that the Minister of Court has already raised the matter with Mr. Jacks wdio had promised to telegraph to London to enquire. 7. I asked Feroughi whether His Majesty wished me to say anything about the Treaty. His Majesty, to who Feroughi repeated my enquiry, replied that he knew very little about the details of the Treaty, but would only say that he considered that negotiations were still continuing. I then asked Feroughi to say the following His Majesty :— A succession of British Governments had during the past eight years endeavoured to display the most friendly and helpful attitude towards Persia; I was convinced that His Majesty could not point to say single Persian grievance against His Majesty’s Government. His Majesty’s present government wished for the best possible relations with Persia and to that end had expressed their willingness to make a number of far-reaching con cessions with a view to liquidating the past so that Persia could not complain th at her sovereign rights were infringed in any direction. His Majesty’s Government regretfully felt, however, that their attitude was insufficiently appreciated ; that Persia hard'y seemed inclined to meet them half way and that they ffiared some of the old suspicio s sti l remained. I should be glad to have His Majesty’s personal assurance that this was not so. I cited the free gift this summer to the Persian Government of all the arms and ammunition wffiich had been stored since the war in His Majesty’s Con sulates and which could not be valued at less than £5,UG0 and I rdded that while it had been noted that Persian Government contracts and orders had been offered to nearly every country with which Persia had relations, nothing had been offered to Great Britain. His Majesty’s replied that he wanted nothing better than the most friendly relations with His Majesty s Government; but he was not clear whether His Majesty’s Government wished to see Persis strong or weak. Here I interrupted to say that I was surprised at His Majesty’s doubts; both my predecessor and I had repeatedly assured him that Great Britain only wanted to see a strong and independent Persia, but freed from the doubts and suspicions of the old days, and I could not conceive where His Majesty could have obtained the impression that His Majesty's Government wished to sie a weak Pe s a. His Majestv thanked me for this assurance and con tinue d in every goiieral terms to discuss the question of friendship between the two countries and the usefulness to Great Britain of a strong and friendly Persia. He made no r. ference to my remarks about the old suspicions or to the almost marked way in which all Government orders had been offered to every country except Great Britain, nor did he express any thanks for the generosity of His Majesty’s Government in making a free gift to Persia of the arms and ammunition from the different consulates, I feel doubtful, therefore, whether Feroughi accurately interpreted what I had said or whether in fact he did not deliberately omit my more critical remarks.

As you will have learned from recent despatches, the Persian press, and especially the Shafag-i-Sorkh, have been indulging in a violent anti- British campaign, with Bahrein as the usual text for their articles. A recent article, however, struck me as so outrageous, in that it might almost be an incitement to murder Major Daly, that I have addressed, a personal letter, of which copy is enclosed, to the Minister of Court. 2. To-day the Minister for Foreign Affairs had been good enough to invite me to a farewell luncheon before my departure on leave at which, in addition to the membei s of my staff, the Minister of Court and the whole of the Persian Cabinet were present. I timed my letter to reach Teymourtache an hour or two before the hour fixed for the luncheon, and after the luncheon was over he came up to tell me that he had duly received it. I said that I personally attached very little importance to Press articles but there was a limit to everything, and I was bound to take the most serious exception to the recent article in the “ Shafagh-i-Sorkh ” in which the writer of the letter stated about Major Daly that it was unfortunate that he was only struck in the ear by the bullet that was fired at him some years ago at Bahrein. 3. As it is common knowledge that Teymourtache receives an almost daily visit from Dashti, the editor of this paper, he was at some pain to explain away the intimacy with this gentleman to which I referred in my letter. He professed not to have read the article in question but admitted that it was unpardonable ; he went on to say that Dashti, who was a sort of free lance Journalist, was now attacking everybody, mcluding the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Finance, and that he was a most in convenient mi rnbei of the Majlis. I tried to show the Minister of Court that I was not much impressed by these excuses and told him that I believed that in most countries the Public Prosecutor would have taken action against the Editor of the paper for publishing such an article I said th t I left it to him to take the necessary action to prcvent the Persian press publishing such articles and such statements in future and added that I had felt bound to report the matter fully to my Government. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch, with its enclosure to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.15i (129) ^ {Received on 1st Noventer 1930, with Polit cal Secretary's Utter No. 42, dated • the 16th October 1930.)

Letter from His Majesty’s Consul General, Isfahan, to His Majesty s Minister, Tehran, No. 44, dated the 5th September 1930. The course of recent events in the Bakhtiari and neighbouring areas has perhaps been of sufficient interest and importance to justify a special despatch and I have the honour to submit herewith a narrative of the opera tions. It is compiled from information obtained from various sources not all of which were very reliable but I hope that it is in the mam accurate Two great difficulties have impeded my compilation; first the fact that hardly anybody has any real idea of how things are going, as all reports appear to be transmitted direct, and with secrecy, to Tehran and nowhere else ; and second the suspicion with which any manifestation of interest on the part of consular officers is regarded by all in authority, t p to &lt;' ’ ‘ j' ever, I have not heard it said that the present rebellion is instigated by the British.155 2. At the beginning of August last a certain number of government troops were being concentrated at Urujin from Isfahan, for despatch against the Boir Ahmedi tribe. Fighting with the Mamassanis was also in progress. A collection of Qashqai tribesmen, under Malik Kansur Khan, one of ^ the sons of Soulet-ud-Douleh, was collected at Semirum and went off to engage the Boir Ahmedis from the north and north-east. Mean while a force of regular cavalry from Abaci eh under Sardar Bahadur went to attack the tribe from the east, and fighting commenced in the vicinity of the high mountain Kuh-i-Dina, particularly round the village of Pa-Dina at it foot. The Minister of War, Sardar As’ad Bakhtiari, was also sent in person to his own tribe in order to raise a picket force from the Bakhtiaris to co-operate in the attack on the Boir Ahmedis from the north and north-west. He arrived in Bakhtiari on the 7th August and lost no time in convening the heads of the tribe at Chigha-Khur and getting as many tribesmen as possible to offer themselves to deal a blow at the tribe which in the past had caused the Bakhtiaris not a little damage in various raids, to which the latter, not being fully armed, could not easily retaliate. The Bakhtiaris were flattered by the arrival of the Minister of War among them in person ; their enthusiasm for the fight was increased by a supply of about one thousand rifles sent for them by the Government, as well as a certain amount of money ; and the necessary number was soon obtained. I happened to be in Sardar As’ad’s village on the 12th August and saw the standard bearers of the Baba Ahmedi sub-tribe with their flags moving off to cheer on the members of that sub-tribe in their march from Chigha- Khur ; the Minister of War also sent for two long-cherished silver maces stored in his house for many past generations. 3. Sardar Bahadur’s force was at Hanna on the lltn August, and the Qashqai force was then reported to be advancing with little opposition into the territory of the rebel tribe. Meanwhile the Government forces which had been sent against the Mamassani tribe were coming up from the south, and on the 18th August the Boir Ahmedi area was reported to be almost surrounded by the combined forces. Nasir Khan, another of Soulet’s sons, captured Tul-i-Safid 4 an important pass ; and Sardar Bahadur’s force then prepared to attack Sisakhc, where one of the most important of the Boir Ahmedi leaders, Mulla Qubad, was stationed with about two thousand men. 4. On the 17th and 18th August several motor-lorries passed through Isfahan from Tehran, bearing 800—1,000 troops of the Nadiri regiment, as well as ammunition and two mountain guns. The Bakhliari force moved off at about the same time, accompanied by the Minister of War in person, with several other Khans. The Bakhtiari force had been given formal permission by their Khans to loot anything they could find of the enemy s goods or cattle ; and pay at the rate of four krans a day for infantry and six for mounted men was promised. 5. On the 25th August a report was received that Mulla Qubad s force had not then been engaged ; and that during some of the fighting a Boir Ahmedi force had feigned defeat and fled, leaving poisoned food behind them which was eaten by the attackers, causing some deaths. Sisakht wa^ however occupied at about this time, and the Bakhtiaris were efigaged wit the enemy on the slopes of the Kuh-i-Dina and round the Tang-i-Khirsan, behind Falard. In the passage of a river one or two of the Bakhtiaris ios their lives, but the Boir Ahmedis seem to have had the worst of “gn ~ ing, or else to have lost heart. Sardar As’ad, stationed on the 28th Angus at Qal’eh Chinar near the Tang-i-Khirsan, sent a message to the Bakhtiaris in Isfahan, delivered by telegraph, saying that three of the most injportan Boir Ahmedi Khans, named Shukrullah Khan Garmoin, Mulla Qubad an ^ Qaid Nasir, had surrendered in person, and that Sartip Khan, nephew o Shukrullah, had sent a message to Sardar As’ad surrendering comply Y on the sole condition that the Minister of War would give him a persona safe-conduct that his life would be spared.156 Ahmedi Khans submit ted^ a 1 Tth ^p 8661118 that the Principal Boir been successful.

His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to trans mit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule on the subject of Anti-British articles in the Persian Press. Despatch to the Foreign Office, No. 531, November 3rd, 1930. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office London, No. 531, dated the 3rd November 1930. You will have learned from a recent despatch that the Minister of Court has described the control exercised by the Persian Government over the local press as “ eliminatcire, mais pas prescriptif ”. It is perhaps scarcely necessary to comment further on so evident and characteristic a falsehood, but it is not without interest to gauge the extent of the directive control exercised by the Government from a press campaign at present ranging in several of the more important Tehran newspapers in connexion with an article in the “ Near East ” of October 2nd on the Kurdish question. The “ Near East ” is one of the few British newspapers from which extracts are regularly translated and sent home by the Persian Legation in London. It is not obtainable in Tehran. 2. In this article, which I have not yet seen, it is apparently stated that the policy of the Persian Government in their dealings with the Kurds within their borders is not of the most enlightened order. The reply of the Persian press is a torrent of mvestive, the terms of which are so uniform that it is impossible not to deduce a common origin. His Majesty’s Government, having failed in their dastardly attempt to stir up trouble among the Kurds settled beyond the reach of their mandatory control, have now decided to concentrate all their energies on the propagation of racial hatred within the mandate. Having contrived the acceptance of a treaty almost totally disadvantageous to ’Iraq, their next step is to ensure the support of the oil bearing areas at the expense of racial harmony, for which they care nothing. In ’Iraq their motto is still “ Divide et impera ”, while in Turkey and Persia their policy mav be likened to the officious protection of the Christian minorities in the Ottoman Empire by czarist ^ uss i a - They would do well to establish the counterpart of the proposed Baghdad Perma nent Kurdish Commission in India, where the “ gtoans of the whole popula tion deafed the ears of the world ”. As for ’Iraq, let her beware of such157 insidious attempts to undermine her sovereign status : they are the first-fruits of a disastrous treaty which she should never have signed. 3. The attitude of the Persian press has at no period during recent years been other than unfriendly, but I have thought it well to report upon this A particular campaign, which not only provides conclusive proof of the strict directive control exercised by the Persian Government in spite of all assur ances to the contrary, but illustrates the abrupt change of heart which has been noticeable in Persian official quarters since the conclusion of the Anglo- ’Iraqi treaty. A few months ago the attitude of the Persian press towards ’Iraq was uniformly hostile, but during the last few weeks the “ Shafagh-i- Serkh ”, the editor of which is on intimate terms with the Minister of Court has gone out of its way to publish a whole series of indiscriminately flattering articles on that country, and has even had the effrontery to declare that Persia refrained from recognising ’Iraq until she had succeeded in securing on behalf of her neighbour the abolition of the capitulatory system. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for ’Iraq.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Consul, Tabriz, to His Majesty s Minister, Tehran, No. 164, dated the 18th September 1930. I have the honour to report that Sureya Zia Bey, the son of the Turkish Consul-General, called on me yesterday and declared that i Ararat had now been completely cleared of rebels.158 Later. September 2ord, 1930. 6. 1 had, however, heard so many directly contradictory reports that 1 have held back this despatch in order to try and ascertain the truth. The General is unfortunately away, and my Armanian informants give a very different version to that of Sureya Bey and the Turkish Official Communiques. 7. The following might appear to be a fairly accurate resume of the situation :— 8. Failing to obtain military co-operation of serious value from the Persians, Salih Pasha asked that they should confine themselves to guarding the frontier and leave the Turkish troops freedom of action. A general attack from the direction of Igdir and Beyezid was launched on September 5th and continued on September 6th. To give effect to the encircling movement involved the Turks again traversed a short stretch of Persian territory, but apparently with the consent of the Persians on this occasion. 9. The initial attack, which took the Kurds by surprise, was successful and their forces were split into two groups ; one of which retreated up the slopes, while the other group at first retreated down the slopes and was thus soon overrun by the advancing Turks. 10. On the second day (September 6th) this second group attacked the Turks in the rear and met with some success, but Turkish reserve—alleged to have been supported by 600 Russian cavalry and 7 aeroplane made a detour through Russian territory and saved the situation. 11. The Kurds were finally driven back, but Armenian sources declare that they have not been driven completely off Mount Ararat. 12. The Kurds on this occasion are alleged to have burnt 17 Turkish prisoners. 13. Shelid Agha and his men prepared to help in the above fighting, but finally decided to await the result before taking part. 14 . T he local Chief of Police tells me that the war is far from being obable that the bacK oi me _ . . 17. The Turkish credits for the campaign are also reported to have al been expended already.15^ (134) ENDORSEMENr FROM THE FOREIGN AND POLITICAL DEPARTMENT, No. P. 2D N/30, dated New Delhi, the 18th November 1930.

Letter from the Foreign Office, London, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, Ko. 556, dated the 28th October 1930. In your telegram No. 269 of October 20th (Serial No. 138), you requested instructions regarding the letter sent to His Majesty’s Consul General at Bushire by the Presian Governor to the effect that in future all communica tions between foreign Consular Officers and himself should be in the Persian language, and that if such communications were accompanied by a foreign text the Persian text should be regarded as authoritative. 5 2. In reply, I have to inform you that there has long been a general rule that His Majesty’s Consular Officers shall use the English language in their communications with local authorities, in spite of local regulations in certain countries demanding the use of the local language in correspondence. The rule has, however, been modified in some cases where the question has arisen, by allowing the transmission of non-guranteed translations in the language of the country. 3. In these circumstances, there appears to be no reason for a departure at Bushire from the existing practice, which corresponds to the practice permitted at other posts where difficulties have arisen, and His Majesty's Consul General should continue to address his official letters to the Governor in English and Persian, the English text only being signed, and the Persian text being regarded merely as a translation the accuracy of which is not guaranteed.

In continuation of Sir Robert Clive’s despatch No. 521 of October 22nd last, I have the honour to furnish you with the following supplementary information on the subject of the negotiations which the representative of the Batignolles Construction Company has been conducting with the Minister of Court. 2. It seems that the Company, hacked by a syndicate in which the Banque de Paris et des Pays Bas figures prominently, was actually ready to pay (as opposed to loan) the Persian Government fifteen or sixteen million tomans for a match monopoly for thirty years, but apparently on condition that a portion of this sum should be spent on railway construction in South Persia under contract with the Batignolles Construction Company. As already reported, this project has fallen through, the Government having undertaken the task of repairing and continuing the southern sector of the railway itself, besides intimating that if it granted a match monopoly at all it would probably be to the Swedish Match Trust. 3. I might add in this connection that the latter’s representative has repeatedly informed the Commercial Secretary that bis company would never pay more than two hundred thousand dollars (200,000) a year for a Persian match monopoly, particularly in view of the conditions which the Persian Government would certainly wish to impose with a view to safeguard the consumer against an inordinate rise in the price of matches. Owing to the financial situation, Major Carlherg recently added, Mr. Ivan Kruger was none too anxious to force the negotiations to a conclu sion in the near future. 4. Where a tobacco monopoly is concerned, I understand that Monsieur Rouherol’s original suggestion was that his company should be allowed to form a ‘ regie ’ in partnership with the Persian Government, the former providing the whole of the working capital which might be needed, estimated at five million dollars (£5,000,000). The profits were to be shared on a sliding scale. Of the first million tomans, sixty-five per cent, were to go to the Government and thirty-five per cent, to the Company, of the second million, 75 per cent, to the Government and 2 per cent, to the company and so on. I am told, on what should he good authority, that this scheme does not meet with the approval of the Persian Government which might, however, be prepared to grant the Batignolles Construction Company a monopoly of the export of tobacco on the same lints as the monopoly recently granted to Haji Amin for the export of opium. A preliminary agreement seems to ha\e been initialled and Monsieur Rouberol has telegraphed to France for four tobacco experts to enable him to make a final decision. I am told that the Minister of Court hopes to benefit personally from such an arrangement to the extent of twenty thousand to forty thousand pounds. 5. 'With reference to Sir Robert Clive’s despatch No. 519 of October 22nd [Enclosure of Serial No. (126)], I learn that the Director of the Tobacco Mono poly proposed several months ago that he should be allowed to borrow. four million eight hundred thousand tomans from the Imperial Bank of Persia asadditional capital. With this sum he guaranteed that he would be able to monopolise completely the manufacture, sale and export of Persian tobacco, as well as the importation and sale of foreign tobacco and cigarette, paper, at an estimated jrjfit of eight million tv. o hundred thousand tomans the loan from the Bank to be refunded in three years. According to Moses Khan, Teymour- tache was enthusiastically in favour of this project which he studied most care fully but, much to its author’s surprise, nothing more was heard of it after a time the reason being that His Highness had successfully blackmailed the big tobacco merchants to the tune of sixt} -five thousand tomans.

I am sending a copy of the enclosure to His Majesty’s Minister, and to the Secretary in charge of Commercial Affairs at Tehran. Copy of Notes on a Journey from Isfahan to Yezd—June 12th to 16th, 1930. 1. Road .—The usual motor road leaves Isfahan at present by the Allah Verdi Khan bridge at the end of the Chahar Bagh avenue; on this bridge permits to leave the town are examined. The traveller then proceeds on the right bank of the Zayendeh Rud river and re-crosses it to the left bank at the next bridge, known as the Khaju. The Yezd road then continues for some way parallel with the left bank and finally turns northwards and leaves the river valley. The exit from the town in fact involves a long detour and steps are being taken now to cut a road through the town so that the river will not need to be crossed at all. The road is easily passable for any car, except probably during and just after rainy weather. Tne section of about five miles just before reaching Sagzi (30 miles out) crosses a salt waste or “ Kavir ” which in rainy weather simply becomes a swamp in which the car’s wheels may r sink to any depth. A few loads of small stones have been sprinkled over a good deal of it, and whenever the ruts, made by the passage of multitudes of heavy lorries, get more than about eight inches deep road—men are sent out from Isfahan to shave off the edges of the ruts and so make the surface flatter. To make a perma nent road here will be expensive. The rest of the road is not so bad. From Sagzi to Kuh-pa (58 miles) the surface is entirely untouched except by the wheels of passing traffic ; unfort unately it lies across an almost endless succession of undulations, which make the drive the most maddening task for the driver, who is trying all the time to get a little speed up but always finds a fearful series of waves awaiting him. After leaving Kuh-pa the road ascends gradually for about 25 miles, but the surface is not bad except for occassional ditches, traps for the unwary. Finally the top of the pass or Mazra’-i-Mullah-Ahmad is reached, and from thence the road slopes down for eighteen miles to Nain. At Nain (96 miles) there is a telegraph rest-house and an ancient town surrounded by ancient villages, most of w hich seem to bear the same name, Nain. The road from Nain to Yezd pursues a south-easterly direction and is in places rather sandy. An attempt is being made to spread the surface with small stones which passing traffic has to grind in. Aghda is a convenient half-way spot at 43 miles from Nain ; from there the road is good to Shamsabad ; from which place the road leads over desolate region with practically no water nor resting place for 60 miles, w r hen the town of Yezd is sighted. Dried-up watercourses intersect the road in many places, and need careful negotiating to avoid damage to springs.164 to Na^99t!le?S S to Vezd'S mVer^tostT “ : '7 Is t fahan is to leave Isfahan in the afternoon, arriving at Nahi'fortiiJ'nfo'ht • ^nd reaching Yezd at about noon the following day. ° ' ’ d 2. Communications. The road to Kerman, via Anar and Rafsinjan is as good as that from Isfahan to Yezd; cars get through in a day without much trouble. Spare water ought to he carried. 3 Local circles are talking a good deal of a road across the Lut desert via Tab has and fun to Meshed. Local merchants consider that the cons'ruction of such a road wou d not be very costly and would be of great benefit to trade It would presumably go through Pusht-i-Badum, Tabbas, Tun, Bijistan and Turbati Haidan. This road, if built, would form an important link in the despatch of goods from abroad to Meshed via Bandar Abbas. This route would not touch Kerman, it mmld pass through Bandar Abbas, Saidabad, Bahrama- bad (Ratsinjan), Yezd, Tabbas, Tun and so to Meshed. As at present a consi derable proportion of goods consigned to Meshed come through India via Karachi and Duzdap, this route may make a difference to Indian transit trade. The great advantage of the new route Tvould be that the goods would only pay customs once at Bandar Abbas, freight would also probably be a little cheaper. At the beginning of June a great to-do was made about the depredations of locusts. Representatiyes of the Ministry of the Interior had visited Yezd from Tehran, and had reported great damage in order to get more money to spend on anti-locust measures. As a matter of fact, no damage whatever had then been done. Prices of foodstuffs however rose in anticipation of damage. Tim second generation of locusts were very plentiful in the hopping stage on the road from lezd to Isfahan at the beginning of July, and it was feared that some damage to crops would be caused by them ; it appears however that such fears were baseless. 3. Yezd; General Description .—At the time of visiting (June 13th to 15th) the town of Yezd appeared to be one of the hottest and most unpleasant places imaginable The car, after travelling 210 miles from Isfahan without sticking in anything, finally came to a dead stop i &gt; about two feet of sand in the middle of Yezd. To a stranger the most remarkable feature of Yezd is the complete absence of water ; no water channels are to be seen any wdiere. The roads are tortuous, uneven and sandy, bordered by blank walls of mud. The bazaars are dirty and unattractive. Signs of rope-making and silk-weaving are to be seen. The most remarkable objects wdiich meet the eye are the ‘ bad-girs ’ or windtowers which are supposed to attract the wind and serate the rooms beneath. A small masonry tank of water is kept filled in the room immediately beneath each badgir. This cools and moistens the air which otherwise is hot and parching. 4. Local Authorities .—The Governor, Mirza Ghulam Ali, Mu’in-ul-Mulk, is a pleasant man and very friendly indeed. He has a tired appearance and constantly complains of overwork. He lives in a tumbledown building which w*as probably w orth seeing tw'O hundred years ago but has not been repaired much since. The Governor’s great complaint is that although he is supposed to look after everything that is going on, the subordinate heads of departments receive their orders direct from the Ministries in Tehran, and he never knows what they are really doing. The consequence is that every one pulls in different w T ays and corruption and incompetence are rife. 5. Commercial Notes .—The Yezdi merchant is a conservative and thick headed individual. He seems to have no idea of small profits and quick returns; he apparently has never been known to sell anything for less than he gave for it however much the market may have turned against him or however heavy his storage charges may be. Tapestry-woven floor-coverings or ghilims of the ‘ zilu variety are made, the best ones coming from the village of Maibud, some 38 miles distant from Yezd and about five miles from the Indo-European Department main telegraph line. They are sold at about 38 krans a shah man ; various patterns are made, some being qnite attractive. Yezd silks are still made.165 Only about 26 touring cars exist in Yezd ; a good many cars and lorries, however, pass through it on tbeir way between Kerman and Isfahan. It is estimated that about 150 cars and trucks garage at Yezd during a month. Efforts have been made to obtain a British tyre agency for a local ^ merchant; although it is true that at present importation into Persia is, owing to exchange difficulties, fraught with great danger and risk, yet tyres of some sort are needed by the market and if the merchant does not obtain the British agency he will presumably get an American one. 6. Anglo-Persian Company .—The arrangements for retailing the products of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in the vicinity of Yezd are as follows There is an office at Isfahan which sells petrol and Kerosene. At Nain and Yezd ther* is an agent who sells the same. At Arjanoon (ten miles beyond Aghda, between the latter and Yezd) and at Aghda the Company’s agent at Ardakan has a sub-agent working for him selling petrol. Prices in Yezd are 11 krans per shah man for petrol and 8 per shah man for kerosene. The petrol market at Yozd has improved considerably since the opening of the motor route from Bandar Abbas. The kerosene market at Yezd is largely influenced by importations by local merchants of the Bussian kerosene from Shahrud; the Russians have also an agency in Yezd for the sale of petrol and kerosene, but the Anglo-Persian Oil Company holds a sufficient share of the trade to control prices at a reasonable figure. 7.

His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Eoreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the documents mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the subject of Azerbaijan news.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Consul, Tehran, to His Majesty’s Minis ter, Tehran, No. 174, dated the 10th November 1930. I have the honour to report that General Zafar Dauleh lunched here yesterday, and during our private conversation afterwards he gave me the following information :— 1. The Russians having failed to stop progress upon the Rawanduz Route had concentrated with increased energy upon the Baku-Julfa Railway. This should be finished by the Spring of 1981. 2. Meanwhile they had abandoned further developments towards Lenkoran though there was nothing to prevent them resuming development work in this direction later on. 3. No work was being done around Shusha, and the zone south of this was still too unsettled to allow of construction activities, even if they were contemp lated. 4. Persian organization in the direction of the Moghan steppe was almost non-existent ; there not even being telegraph lines laid in this direction. H e had pointed this defect out to the Shah, and it would shortly be remedied. 5. Erom Tabriz to Julfa was still absolutely vulnerable, and there was noth ing to prevent the Russians carrying out their threats (in June) of running their armoured trains over the Julfa bridge right down to Tabriz.6. He had, therefore asked permission to organise a line of defences in and around Marand, and hoped he would be allowed to start work upon this next spring. r &lt;nnnn ^ the end of 1931 the Azerbaijan Army should have been increased to 40,000 men. He hoped that he would be given the means to equip them in a modern way, and make them into a force likely to inspire respect from their northern and western neighbours. 8. He had raised a cavalry regiment in the Mishkin District, and this was to toim the nucleus of an eventual entire cavalry Division. 9. He had also insisted upon an increase of the artillery. 10. Ihe position was that the only road fit for heavy wheeled traffic in the north-Tvestern part of Azerbaijan was the road from Astara to Ardebil. The rest of the roads were difficult to use, and easily defensible. 11. On the other hand the coastal road from A.stara to Biku would lend itself to a “ Coup de main ” upon Baku and the oilfields by an eventual Mishkin Cavalry Division. 12. He believed that.if the Russians brought 100,000 men down to the Persian front in Azerbaijan, they would have to deal with renewed revolts in the Caucasus and could not drive in the front of a well equipped Persian force of 40,000 men posted in previously prepared defensive positions. .13. The creation of such a potentially respectable force would enable Persia to negotiate upon better terms with both her neighbours; and, as the activities of the Musawat party in the Erivan Province had already created friction between Russia and Turkey, and as Turkey, was jealous of ail Russian ideas of expansion in this direction, he did not dispair of seeing Turkey recede from any entente with Russia as to the partitioning of Azerbaijan. 14. When the above defensive preparations had been completed, he would welcome being sent as Ambassador or temporary special envoy to Angora to discuss the -whole situation. Note. —Personally I venture to consider General Zafer Dauleh would be an admirable selection in every way. 15. He devoutly hoped that the Rawanduz Route would be open to lorries—■ even as a temporary track—by next spring. There w r as a general inclination here to use it in absolute preference to the Julfa-Batum route. 16. My wdfe and I accepted the General’s invitation to a farew r el party to he offered by him and the Garrison on November 12th to Colonel Husameddin Bey upon the latter’s relinquishing his duties as Turkish Liaison Officer with the Persian N. W. Army. (147) (Received on 21st December 1930, icith Political Secretary s letter No. 49, dated the 4th December 1930.)

Copy forwarded to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, and Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, New Delhi, for information. Subject :— Shah’s visit to Kerman, Despatch No. 84-1391, dated the 4th December 1930, to His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires Tehran. Letter from His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, to His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, No. 84/1391, dated the 4th December 1930. I have the honour to submit the following account of the visit of H.I.M. the Shah to the Kerman Province. 2. There had. been rumours of the intended visit for some time but the general opinion was against the Shah coming. No ruler of Persia had been to Kerman for over a century and it was a Kermani who assassinated Naser-ud-Din Shah only 34 years ago. However in the early part of November definite news was received that the Shah was really on his way. Frantic preparations ensued. The Governor became a much harrassed man. He complained to me that nothing had so far made him realize so clearly what a wretched place Kerman was : lacking in practically all the rattle-trap of civilized life. This opinion was certainly confirmed as far as I was concerned by a deluge of requests. The Shah slept in our blankets and sheets, “ abode his hour or two ” in the consulate tents, dined off our plates, ate with our knives and forks and read by the light of our lamps. Even our cook was borrowed to prepare his meals. 3. The “ Istiqbal ” was arranged at a distance of about 2 miles from the town, but the local officials went out 21 miles to the small town of Mahun where the Shah was to lunch before coming in to Kerman. However they were all turned back as His Majesty, feeling the need of his opium nipe, was in no mood to be trifled with. The arrangements for tne Istiqbal at Kerman were that the representatives of the various communities, departments, etc., were to occupy tents on each side of the road. The first tent on the right was given to the Ulema and opposite them was pitched that of H, B. M.’s Consul. The others in order of precedence were Red Lion and Sun Municipality Notables, foreign firms, Merchants, Parsis, Russian Sharaq, Jews. The tent for the Shah and his suite were pitched about 100 yards in front. It had been arranged that the various delegations should each be presented in turn. I was to have appeared with the European community but at the last moment I was accorded a separate audience. His Majesty asked me if I had been in Persia before and on my replying that I had been Vice-Consul with the Bakhtiaris during the war, he asked whether I had not paid them large sums. I thought it best to treat the matter light-heartedly and noticing that Sardar Assad was present I replied that I had paid considerable sums in which the M ar Minister had his share. The Shah seemed much amused and turned to Assai who smiled sheepishly. His Majesty then said he hoped I now found to necessity to subsidize the tribes in the Kerman district to which I answered that, thanks to his beneficient rule, there was nothing for a foreign Consul to do but to think of trade and economic matters. I then proceeded to unfold my project for a cotton spinning mill and hydro-electric scheme foratrfrr t0 th ,? G —or-Gene ra ], present activities were atonement for mv past deeds' 1 UP ^ Saying that my 4. Of the other delegations onlv the representative, f p ^ weavers received any notice.

Copy sent to :— The Hon’ble the Political Resident, Bushire. The Foreign Department, New Delhi.Letter from His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain, No. 540/1/20, DATED THE 8TH DECEMBER 1930. I have the honour to enclose two copies of my report of the visit of His Imperial Majesty The Shah to Sistan Consulate Area. Letter from His Majesty’s Consulate, Sistan and Kain, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 110/1/20, dated the 8th December 1930. Subect :— Visit of His Imperial Majesty the Shah to Sistan, Consulate Area. In compliance with the instructions contained in Circular Despatch No. 16 of 18th April, 1 have the honour to submit a report on the recent visit of His Imperial Majesty The Shah to East Persia. H. I. M. The Shah arrived at Birjand at 4 p.m., on the 17th November 1930. An inspection of the Military Detachment was held and fault was found with the Officer Commanding owing to the poor condition of the Cavalry horses. Officials and representatives of the gentry and merchants were present in tents, pitched, a short distance from the town. The Shah spoke to the leading Mullah Shaik Hadi, but no other presentations were made. He proceeded at once to the private house of H. E. Shaukat U1 Mulk, where he spent the night. He left for Safidawa at 7 a.m., on the 18th. Tents had been pitched for the accommodation of His Majesty and Staff for the night of 18th/19th. The Governor of Sistan and Sarhang Murteza Khan from Sistan were there to receive His Majesty, who besides his staff was accompanied by Shaukat III Mulk and Hissam Ud Dowleh (Governor of Birjand). The Minister of Court who had accompanied His Majesty to Meshad remained in Khorassan, it is said to inspect the landed property of the Mutawalli Bashi of Meshad shrine. An incident occurred while the procession of cars was passing through the village of Mudd. A car, said to be that of the Amir-i-Lashkar-i-Sharq, or one containing personal effects of His Majesty which was immediately follow ing, knocked down and severely injured a small boy aged eight. The driver pulled up and gave the father seven Krans and proceeded on his journey. Although the Shah’s medical adviser was in the car immediately behind, no first aid assistance was given. The child was taken by its relatives to Birjand, where the Reis Nazmieh, dissatisfied by the attention given it by the Municipal Doctor, and presumably fearing unpleasant consequences if the child were not well treated, took the boy to our Vice-Consulate dispensary. It was found to be suffering from a severe compound fracture of the Humerus and various scalp wounds. Our Medical Officer at Birjand gave all possible attention but informed the Police that in view of the time which had elapsed and the fact that the wound had not been kept clean, there was grave danger of sepsis. The Municipal Doctor fearing that his conduct in the case might be reported, then telegraphed to the Shah’s private physician saying that the arm might require amputation and asking if he should be sent to Meshad. Our Assistant Surgeon was of the opinion that amputation was unneces sary, but wisely refrained from taking part in the controversy. No further news has yet been received from Birjand. The incident is referred to as an instance of the lack of consideration shewn, which can hardly have produced a good impression of His Majesty s entourage.I TO Late on the evemr? of the 10th a letter was received fr., m the Governor- ate, addressed to the Oftce of H B. M. Consul ” in which it was said that His Majesty would arrive at the Naurab (stretch of water four miles from Sistan where cars have to be ferried over on rafts) at 3 p.m., the following dav and that a tent had been pitched for the Consular Corps, and the latter should be present at the tent at 2-30 p.m. Accordingly, accompanied by members cf the Consulate Staff I arrived at the ent the following day. Enquires as to whether uniform was to be worn elicited the informaaon that nothing was known as to procedure, but that His iMajesty and Stair would certainly be in uniform. On arrival at the tent we were received by the clerk of the Municipality. The Soviet Consul and Staff and the Afghan Consul were already in the tent. As I had never previously met the former the clerk effected an intro duction. Persian was the only foreign language known to the Russian Consul and his staff. The Consul’s knowledge was limited, but sufficient to maintain a conventional conversation. Pour tents had been pitched, one for the Shah, one for Persian Officials, one for the Consular Corps and one by Indian traders. A small cavalry Guard of Honour was present, and the route towards the Town w as sparsely lined for about a mile by followers of local Sirdars with camels and ponies. At a distance of about two miles from the Town the school-children w ere drawn up ready to sing a poem of praise which they have been practising for some months, much to the detriment of the peace of Sistnn. When His Majesty descended from the raft at 3-30 p.m. he was some what feebly cheered by the troops. The Consular Corps enquired whether it would not be seemly for us to stand outside our tent and salute His Majesty as he entered his Shamiana wdiich was close by. We were told to remain in the tent and that “ if required w r e would be sent for A few minor officials, insufficiently important to be presented and who had gathered at a respectful distance from the Shah’s tent, were then stamped from their position by orders of the Amir-i-Lashkar. The Persian Officials, including Herr Brose of the National Bank ^wearing a Pehlevi hat for the occasion) were then called to the Shah’s tent- As they approached a voice was heard to shout maledictions from within the Shah’s tent. It subsequently transpired that the officials approached the tent and stood and saluted His Majesty at the threshold, doubtless nervous about approach- irg too closely without instructions. His Majesty had apparently signalled 'with his hand to them to approach, but the signal had not been understood. He thereupon exclaimed “ Pidr Soockteh ” I tell you to come closer and you all push back. After this gentle admonition there appears to have been no keenness displayed to be first to enter the tent, but the Reis-i-Telegraphs, a grey headed veteran, probably owing to physical incapacity to resist the pushes of those behind him was gradually worked forward. He was seized by the Shah by the lapels of his coat and well shaken. The sequel to this was that, late at night, a sum of 100 Tomans was sent to him as a “ sweetner ”. It is said that the other Officials claimed the right to share in the present on the grounds, I hat if not actually shaken they were all equally soundly cursed. Following these presentations, the leading Mullah and his sons were led to the Shah’s tent. They had prepared a stirring poem to r* ad to His Majesty, the gist cf w hieh was that an ancient name for Sistan had been “ The country of fa day ” (a reference to the fact that Amir Timurgorgani of Turkestan had laid the district waste in half a day) His Majesty would make it once more prosperous in half a day. , _ ^ , A.armed by the crestfallen return of the Officials, the Mullahs were unable to summon up courage to start on the poem and took it back, unread, to their tent. It was then turned over to the next deputation to bo presented, who were seen to be four representatives of the Persian Traders petty shop-171 A bold spirit anlong fie four attempted to read the poem but was cut short by his His Majesty. The Shah could be heard admonishing them in a loud voice, but it was not possible to hear what was actually said, from our position in the adjacent tent. They retired without having preferred the numerous requests they had to make for ’ assistance in furthering the trade of ^ Siscan. There now remained only the Indian traders and the Consular Corps. The former had pitched a very tastefully decorated tent and had flattered themselves that His Majesty would he pleased to enter it. They were not presented, and their salutes as His Majesty subsequently drove past their tent w r ere not acknowledged. After a weary wait of close upon two hours the Amir-i-Lashkar now inti mated that His Majesty would receive the Consular Corps. His Majesty stood alone in the tent which was small so that the threshold was not more than two yards from where he stood. The Amir-i-Lashkar stood at attention outside the tent and gave no indication of the procedure to be adopted. I accordingly walked up to the edge of the tent and saluted thus un wittingly laying myself open to the treatment already meted out to the Tele graph Master, about which I had not then learnt the details. His Majesty said nothing, but beckoned w ith his forefinger for me to approach, the signal being similar to that usually employed to call a cab, could not be mistaken and in that respect I w'as more fortunate than the Reis-i-Telegraph. His Majesty shook hands, then shook bands with the Russian Doctor under the impression that he w r as the Consul. He was almostogenial towards the Afghan Consul, declaring that he recog nised him as having been in Tehran some years ago, made some enquiries as to how he liked Sistan and finally instructed him to call to see him at 6 p.m. His Majesty then turned to me. Meanwhile the Amir-i-Lashkar had entered the tent and explained that I was Major Daly, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Sistan. His Majesty seemed somewhat confused and considered for a moment while he muttered, “ Delhi, Delhi, w 7 hat has he to do with Delhi ? ” The Amir-i-Lashkar then explained that Daly was my name. His Majesty then enquired how lonsr I had been in Persia and learning from the Amir-i-Lashkar that I spoke Persian, asked where I had learnt the language. • He further enquired whether I did not consider that Sistan was a highly important district. I replied that it was, and that it was capable of considerable development which w r ould doubtless take place under the favour of His Majesty’s rule. He seemed pleased at this remark and explained that it was unfortunate that he could not spend more time here, but added “ I shall find out all I want to know ”. He then asked the Russian Consul if there were any Russian subjects in Sistan. The reply w r as in the negative. His Majesty appeared to be about to say something, but changed his mind and turning to me asked if there were many British subjects. His Majesty then again shook hands with me, and thanked me for having come to meet him. No opportunity was given to present any members of the Consulate Staff. His Majesty enquired of the Amir-i-Lashkar “ Who are all these people ? ” and on learning they were members of the Consulate Staffs said “ Oh I see ”. We were then ushered back into our tent while the Shah entered his car and proceeded at a great pace to Sistan. In the distance police could be seen beating the populace to their feet, the majority having sat down. It was learnt that His Majesty did not stop to see the school children, so that the months of vocal training were spent in vain. As His Majesty neared the towm, a man ran forward bearing a small pile of brush wood on his head which he had set alight as the Shah’s car approached. His M &gt; jesty stopped his car to enquire the reason for this and was told by172 the man that he was much oppressed by his Sardar and that of his neighbours was one of continual destitution would enquire into the state of the peasants. that his position and His Majesty said he The Shah proceeded straight to the house of Hisam Ud Dowleh which g been T ,. 1 ? e . , dro . ve V hr0U ? h the Khiyabans of tlie “ new ” town- Murteza Khan in autkipa^on Trffif MatS^^visr' ^ SarhanS known as “ the town of walls ’'. It is distinguished^ the fait thatThTno inhabitants, although giving the illusion of fine streets and sumptuous house. There are some eight wide, straight avenues, brilliantly illuminated at nTht by eleoncity, bounded on either side by high white-washed walls and with SlTSfSUr ■* *‘ ,h * ““»' To I hose in the know that is “ the sum and total ” of the town, with ,| f th , e ’‘O'? 86 ; situated in a garden, which the Shah occupied. Behind the walls and within the fine entrances are plots of waste land, on which there arc not and never likely to be, any buildings. The inhabitants continue to live m the ancient part of the town which His Majesty did not see Sarhang Murteza Khan informed me that His Majesty was well pleased with the new town. He also complimented Hisam Ud Dowleh on his garish, modern dwelling and told Shaukat U1 Mulk to learn from his nephew and bring his fine old Persian house at Birjand “ up to date Those w ho anticipated that they would see His Majesty inspect the town etc., the following day, were astounded to learn that he had already left for Dnzdep at 6 a. m on the 20th. The only mark of his visit seemed to be that oistan was n &gt; longer to be Known as such, but henceforth to revert to its ancient name of Zabul. On arrival at Hurmak 30 miles from Duzdap, the Shah was met by the Governor and Officials of that place. Captain Alban, His Majesty’s Vice- Consul had been asked to be there and was introduced to His Majesty before any others. M. Graux, the Director of Customs was questioned as to the customs receipts and Herr Gaenzer as to the progress of the National Bank. Tae Shah then retired to a small house for lunch and rest. A mile from the town Persian and Indian traders had set up tents and the school children, dressed in khaki misfits for the occasion stood in line. The Shah inspected the Military Guard of honour and passed on to the schoolchildren. The Master nad scarcely started his poem uf praise, when he was peremptorily cut short and asked if he were not ashamed to bring his hoys out in such badly fitting clothes. The Shah then passed a line of Persian traders and came to the Sikhs—a mixed crowd of all classes. His Majesty enquired 44 Why do these Baluchis uot wear cleaner clothes and the Kulah Pehlevi On learning that they were Sikhs, not Baluchis, he asked if they were all Persian subjects. The Governor replied that they were not but added hastily that tht j y were “ very loyal ”. The Shah then asked about 4 or 5 Parsis who had apparently applied for permiss on to reside in Persia. He evidently had some previous information about them. They were produced from the crowd and he congratulated them on their good sense in returning to the country of their origin. On the way to the Town the Shah stopped to take the petition of some wives of Afghan pilgrims who had their money confiscated on arrival at Duzdap, by the Customs. It is said that the Shah ordered the money to be returned. The Shah staved at the hou*e or Arbab Mehdi, the principal Persian merchant. The Minister for War and others were accmimodated at the house of M. Graux, Director of Customs.173 M. Graux camj^ains bitterly of the insolence of the servants of this high official, who stole all they could lay their hands on while their master was being entertained. While M. Graux was bowing his farewell to His Majesty on the latters departure for Mirjawa on the morning of the 22nd, the servants of the Minister for War were occupied in looting his house of everything easily $ removable. His Majesty received throughout his tour, many very valuable gifts, which he was pleased to accept. The exceptions to this were presentations of camels and horses by the Sardars, which His Majesty returned to the donors. It cannot be said that the visit of His Majesty was looked forward to with any enthusiasm, but undoubtedly it was, with interest. In the case of Sistan, hopes had been encouraged by Sarhang Murteza Khan and others, that the Shah would really take the Agricultural situation into hand and give definite orders for cancellation of the immense arrears of revenue which can never be realised, but the demand for which hangs like the sword of Damocles, for ever spoiling prospects of a brighter future. Far from the centre of Government, South East Persia, had for years heard of the striking personality of the Shah. His power and benevolence had been highly lauded. Such ills as were only too apparent were the work of bad officials. The Shah would put all right. Very few, even of the important Sardars, had ever seen His Majesty. Whatever may have been the object of the Shah’s visit, it certainly has not achieved what must be the principle object of tours undertaken by crowmed heads of Europe—increase of popularity of the occupant of the throne. Everywhere, at least everywhere where such statements can be prudently made, one heard expressions of disappointment. The more enlightened were shocked at the Shah’s lack of graciousness—the common people said “ He is a Taryaki ” and with that expression vanished all respect for the Shah’s person. Sarhang Mnrteza Khan—reputed to have great influence w T ith the Shah — is himself not a little dejected since His Majesty’s visit. I asked if the Shah had been pleased with his visit. He replied 44 1 don’t know—I expect so. He wou 1 d have told me alright if he w ere not ”. A copy of this report is being forw r arded to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. (150) Memorandum from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 254, dated the 9th December 1930. His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the subject of :—the tour in Persia of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia. Tehran despatch No. 584 of 9th December, 1930, to The Foreign Office. ' € Despatch from H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 584, dated the 9th December 1930. I have the honour to inform you that His Majesty the Shah has just returned from a five week’s journey during which he visited Mazanderan, Khorassan, Seistan, the Sarhad, Kerman and Yezd. 2. His Majesty left Tehran on October 27th by motor car for Mazanderan where he remained until November 7th. He w r as joined on that date by the Cabinet Ministers and the Minister of Court. They all proceeded to Bander Shah in a special train and thence to the Turcoman plain for the annual Turcoman hoi seraccs.174 3. Th« Shah then left for Meshed by way of Gumhad Qabus, where he was awaited by the General Officer Commanding, Eastern Division, Boinurd and Kuchan, whilst the crown Prince and most of the Cabinet returned to Tehran, only leymourtache and the Minister of War, Serdar Assad remaining with His Majesty. 5 4. The Shah arrived in Meshed on November 11th, and I be- to enclose herein an extract from the fortnightly diary of His Majesty’s Consul General at Meshed describing details of the royal visit. Meshed was the largest town visited by His Majesty and the account furnished by Colonel BarretAs typical of what usually happens on such occasions wffien there is a strong contrast between the orderly reception organised by the Military and the confusion and chaos which attends the efforts of the civil authorities. The Shah was loud in his praises of the Eastern Division, and the General Officer Commanding received his reward by being allowed to go to Europe for a two year’s course of training in France, w hether he hurried before the Shah had time to return to his capital. 5. His Majesty left Meshed on November loth, visited Mirjand and Seistan and w r ent further south via Duzdap to Khwash, Teymourtache return ing to Tehran from Meshed by air. Not more than a day was given to each place and the return journey began on the 24th November via Earn and Kerman. After a stay of three days in Kerman, the Shah arrived in Yezd on the 30th and taking the direct road via Nain and Kashan, returned to Tehran on the evening of December 3rd, his arrival being celebrated by a display of fireworks. 6. At the reception which he accorded to his Ministers and some Depu ties next day, he stated that he was pleased to have seen the south-east part of his country—this w r as his first visit south of Meshed-and expressed himself as being highly satisfied with all he had seen. As soon as he had left Meshed the Shah caused orders to he sent to the towms ahead that he did not desire any decorations or flag flying. His orders appear to have been strictly observ ed the decorations at Yezd being hurriedly pulled down before the royal arrival. 7. A copy of this despatch has been sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Enclosure in Tehran despatch No. 584 of 9th December, 1930. Extract from Meshed Consular Diary No. 19 for the period ended November 15th, 1930. Persian interests :—(b) General. —254. The Shah arrived in Meshed on November 11. He was accompanied by Taimourtache Minister of Court, Sardar-i-Asad, Minister of War, his Doctor Amir-i-Alam, and his suite which included three members of parliament for Khorasan. He was followed, by special permission, by Rahnama editor of the newspaper “ Iran of Tehran and Dachti editor of the “ Chafaq-i-Surkh ”. He had been met by the Arair-i- Lashkar with three officers and an escort of 40 soldiers at Gumbad-i-Kabus and by the Governor. General and the Chief of the General Staff of the Eastern Armv (Sarhang Khan Baba Khan) at Bujnurd. His Majesty arrived about an hour late at Mil-i-Kariz, some three miles North of Meshed where the Con sular Corps, local officials and notabilities had been hidden to meet him. He w r as travelling in an American Saloon Car. He subsequently expressed dis satisfaction with the anangements made for his reception as v\ell he might for the estimable Jam quite^ lost his head. The Governor General himself chased up and dow n the line of tents which had been erected infoiming the various occupants when it w 7 as their turn to make a bow. Little wonder that when he returned to the Royal presence he was breathless and uncollected introducing some under the w rong name and entirely forgetting to present others Eventually when the merchants of Meshed were announced such a rabble descended on the Royal tent that His Majesty waved them away m anger and stalk d back to his car. At the reception of the ConsularCorps His Majesty had a gracious word to say to Batmanoff, the Soviet Consul General, and doyen of the Consular body, when he recalled haying met before in Ahwaz *md Shiraz. His Majesty’s Consul General alone addressed the Shah in the vernacular. The Governor General was distinctly distracted in introducing the remainder of the staff. His Majesty picked up his cars when Captain Steveni was presented as Attache to the Consulate General and asked « What Attache Jam made a series of incoherent sounds, the Minister of Court, who was standing by, interposed with assurance a dismissive reference to Captain Steveni’s being a member of the Consulate Staff but the situation was actually saved by the unsponsored appearance before His Majesty of the Acting Afghan Consul General with the introduction of whom Jam hastily proceeded. 255. Some half doz*m cows and camels having been sacrificed en route for •good luck His Majesty went to the Shrine where it appears the staff work was admirable. He subsequently rode through the town at considerable speed to the army headquarters and residence of the Amir-i-Lashkar which had been set aside for his reception. Throughout the royal progress through the streets in Meshed no one was allowed at upper floor windows and armed guards were posted on prominent roofs. Amnia guards and infantry lined the streets. During his stay in Meshed His Majesty did not receive the Consular Corps hut held a morning reception of leading officials whom he addressed complimenting them on the success their efforts had achieved but urging them to work with greater zeal so that the greater prosperity and well-being of the country might soon be attained. To the Director of the Pahlevi Bank who complained that his hands were tied because of inadequate staff (and who had been told by his head office to retrench) His Majesty promised full consideration of any project that could be devised to extend’the bank’s activities^ while a short conversation with the director of customs on the subject of opium smuggling led later to sharp words from Tairmourtache to the director of the opium monopoly and talk of dismissal. At any rate Muffakham, the local director of the monopoly, who had already applied for 15 days leave of absence in Tehran, is credited with wishing to leave immediately in order to enlist the support of Eerughi and Taghi Zadeh. 256. The Shah is reported to have beer, very pleased wiih the military and the Amir-i-Lashkar has great hopes that he will reap a well merited rewaid in securing permission to proceed to Erance to follow a two years’ course of military instruction there. The army was extremely creditably turned out and the manoeuvres, arranged for the Shah’s visit seem to have been carried out successfully. Unfortunately they were marred by three casualties, two fatal, as a result of the bursting of a 10 pounder mountain gun formerly belonging to the British army. 257. His Majesty was present at a theatrical display in the newly cons tructed barracks of the Shahpur Begiment? He is said to have drunk the health of the Persian Army in a glass of sherbet and to have referred to the Eastern Army in w r arm terms of praise. He expressed his particular apprecia tion that peace and order had been maintained on the Russian border around Sistan and in Persian Baluchistan without any call being made for assistance from other parts of the country. He complimented the Amir-i-Lashkar, the officers, soldiers and conscription department on the efficient manner in which they had performed their duty. The Amird- Lashkar presented the Shah with a jewelled rifle of German make and bearing the insignia of the Eastern Army 258. The Governor General alone has not shared in the general distribution of parise. Jam admits as he indeed he could scarcely hope to disguise, that the arrangements at Nil-i-Kariz brought upon him royal disapproval, but he claims to nave made up lee-way during the remainder of the imperial visit. It is doubtful however whether Jam is so reassured as he pretends to be. The lack of uniformity in Meshed in the matter of wearing the Kulah pahlevi was particularly noticed by the Shah who contrasted it with the admirable obedience shown in this respect in the Turcoman country. (His176 Majesty was doubtless unaware that the sis hundred odd road workers dis creetly placed on view in that district had received their last pay in the presence of a soldier who had relieved them of their hats and of a few krans giving: a kulah pahlevi iu exchange). Opinion is general that Asadi the ^ Mu t' alU Bashi, who it is known covets the post, stands a very wood chance of v supplanting Jam as Governor General. 259. Th&lt;* Shah visited the Shrine in the morning of November and then left for Turbat-i-Haidari with his Tehran escort and with 2u soldiers of the Eastern Army. 260 Before leaving with Ills Majesty, Tairmourtacbe, who is due to return to Meshed from Turbat-i-Haidari received separately the staffs of the Consulates in Meshed. Bull reports are circulating of his conversation with the Bolsheviks. It is said that Bitmanoff asked for an interview with the Shah which was straightway refused, that he brought up the question of his courier service to the Russian frontier and was told to refer the matter to his legation in Tehran and that the Minister of Court promised to accept and enquire into a list of traitors to the Bolshevik regime who were sheltering in Persia. It is impossible however to put much faith in reports of this rature or to imagine that tl.e two Bolsheviks Taimourtache was other than he was with the members of this Consulate General : an extremely agreeable and impressive discurser of mondainities. Certainly keen ears in an adjoining room and through the burble of pleasant conversaiion with Jam could detect nothing but a note of loud cordiality throughout the Bolshevik interview. 261. It is stated that the Shah has ordered a girls’ school to be opened in Meshed. There are already two in the town. 262. His Majesty presented the lands of Shahan Garmab, a hot spring possessing miraculous healing properties fourteen farsakbs to the south-east of Meshed, to the Red Lion and Sun Society of Khorasan. He also gave 100 Tomans to the woman in charge of the orphanage (a large building outside the town walls to the south erected by Asadi the Mutwalli Basin), 100 tomans for prayers for himself in the shrine and 100 tomans for division among the road sweepers employed for his reception.

With reference to Sir Robert Clive’s despatch No. 244 of June 3rd last (Enclosure of Serial No. 53), I have the honour to inform you that the Ministry of the Interior is gradually sanctioning the levy by the municipalities of new' taxes intended to compensate them for the loss of revenue from the road taxes which they recently suffered. At first a heavy tax on motor spirit and kerosene was freely spoken of but the idea was abandoned, perhaps for fear of antagonizing the Russians. It was apparently the Isfahan Municipality that first suggested an octroi on alcoholic drinks entering the towns, and this proposal seems to have been generally adopted in conjunction with an increase in the tax on houses and other buildings, including places ofJ77 entertainment. I enclose an extract from the Messager de Teheran which gives a list of the new taxes, other than those on house property, which are being collected by the Tehran Municipality. Generally speaking the provincial municipalities are collecting similar taxes but on a smaller scale. 2. The Trench Legation has shown signs of being greatly perturbed by the Q tax on alcoholic drinks, w T hich must seriously affect the demand for French wines in particular, and Monsieur Maugras has invited various other Legations to make representations similar to his own to the Persian Gov ernment. I attach in this connection a copy of the note he addressed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and also a schedule prepared by the French Legation which shows how formidable these taxes are when added to the existing customs duties and road taxes. 3. Various considerations led me to enter a protest with the Persian Gov ernment ; the danger of these municipal taxes heralding the approach of others ; the inadvisability of introducing fresh taxation at a time when the trade of the country is already at a very low ebb ; and lastly the guarantees given to this Legation in 1926, when the Road Tax Law was being evolved, and actually incorporated in that law. 4. I attach a copy of the note which I addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on Kovember 29th and which I trust may meet with your approval. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq.

British Legation, Tehran, November 27th, 1930. No. Monsieur le Ministre, There are various aspects of the taxes which the Council of Ministers has authorized the Tehran Municipality—as well as certain provincial municipa lities, I understand—to levy on alcoholic drinks of foreign origin entering the town to which I beg to invite Your Highness’ kind attention. 2. In the first place I have difficulty in reconciling these new taxes with the formal assurance, contained in Note 3 to Article 1 of the Road Tax law of the 8th Pebruary 1926 and couched in quite unequivocal terms, it seems to me, that goods having once paid the new road taxes would not be subject to any other tax whatsoever on entering the tow r ns. 3. This guarantee in fact constituted one of the conditions subject to which His Majesty’s Government agreed to the introduction of the road tax— a tax which was intended to replace, and did in fact replace, a multitude of taxes levied on goods from the time they had paid customs dues to the moment they reached their destination and which had never been recognised by my Government as legal. I would in this connection refer Your Highness to the following extract from a letter written by Sir Percy Loraine to His Excellency Hassan Khan Mushar, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the 24th November 1925:— “ They (His Majesty’s Government) have therefore, after careful arid ' sympathetic ^consideration of the project under discussion, autho rised me to inform Your Excellency, and I have great pleasure in doing so, that they are willing to agree for their part to the application of the proposed compounded road tax, if the Persian Government wdll give their favourable attention to the following consideration:— (a) that the existing transport taxes which it is the intention of the Persian Government to supersede hy this compounded road tax shall be definitely abolished and that no taxes of a similar nature will be levied on foreign merchandise in the future, whether in the shape of a reformed municipal taxation or any ther,” etc.4. Secondly, the level of these taxes is of a nature to cause grave concern to the commercial interests affected, particularly in view of the fact that the trade of the country is at present traversing an extremely serious crisis, as Your Highness is well aware. In fact it would not be surprising if they re sulted in an appreciable reduction in the imports of these commodities, thereby injuring the major financial interests of the Persian Government. 5. I would also remind Your Highness that at the time of the signature of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty, His Excellency Pakrevon, in a letter dated 10th May 1928, pointed out to Sir Robert Clive, in reply to the latter’s request for an assurance that the road taxes would not be in creased, that the Persian Government being itself interested in the develop ment of its trade it would be illogical for the Government to impede such development by imposing unnecessarily high charges upon it. 6. Lastly, I may be permitted to express the hope that the municipal authorities do not propose, as might be inferred from various notices published in the press recently, to search the business premises of British firms dealing in alcoholic drinks to make sure that banderoles have been affixed thereto without an order emanating from the competent judicial authority, unless such search be freely sanctioned by the firm con cerned. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Highness the assurance of my highest consideration. (Sd.) R. C. PARR.

Letter from His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 31, dated the 30th July 1930. With reference to the third paragraph of my despatch No. 27 of the 19th July last, I have the honour to inform you that according to reports which have now come in the troops sent out from Shiraz did in fact succeed in reaching Lar and re-establishing contact with the troops of the Governor of Lar, Yavar Muhammad Taqi Khan Arab, but not before the Governor himself was past succour. His body was found, it is said, with no less than thirty bullet wounds. He has been buried in Lar and mourning ceremonies in his honour are now being held in Shiraz. He was generally held to be one of the bravest and most capable officers in the Army of the South. 2. The Government troops having re-occupied Lar and the rebels having retreated to a distance as reported in my previous despatch, fighting has now ceased for the time being owing to the excessive heat and lack of water rendering it impossible for the troops to follow up the rebels. 3. It is difficult to obtain any information concerning the progress of the Mamassani campaign owing to the elaborate precautions taken by the authorities to prevent news leaking through. Even the muleteers transporting supplies to the forces in the field are not allowed to go beyond a point eight miles this side of Ardakan lest they should bring back reports of the state of affairs to their friends in town. AH the indications go to show that the Government troops are making slow progress and that the fighting has been and is very heavy. In a night-attack made by the Boir Ahmadis on the Government troops near Ardakan on the 16th/ 17th July the Army suffered 160 casualties, killed and wounded. Most of the serious cases were brought into Shiraz by motor-lorry, escorted by armoured cars, on Julv 23rd. Yavar Kazim Khan Shabani, officer commanding troops at Kazerun, a cousin of the Amir Lashkar, left Kazerun with the forces under his command for the Mamassani country on the 21st July, According to the rumours current in Shiraz, the Persian Government is going to concentrate 10,000 men against the tribes in this campaign. W here the additional four or five ^thousand are to come from is a question on which 1 sought enlightenment in vain . 4. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Hon’ble the Political Resideiit in the Persian Gulf, His Majesty’s Consul General at Isfahan, and His Majesty s Consuls at Ahwaz and Kerman.

I have the honour to inform you that on August 5th, Mirza Seyed Hassan Khan, Taqizadeh, was appointed Minister of Finance. 2. A record of TaqizadelTs career will be found under No. 25 of Biographies of Persian Notables and he will be known to the Foreign Office as the last Persian Minister in London, where he represented his country from July 1929 to March of this year. 3. Since Mirza Nassau Khan Mushar resigned the Ministry of Finance in April last that Ministry has been in the charge of the Prime Minister. It is evidence of the dearth of suitable men that the Shah and the Government at this critical time of Persia’s finances have been unable for four months to find a suitable Minister for the post. His Majesty had fondly hoped that Mushar would consent to return to the Ministry of Finance but Mushar steadfastly refused to consider the idea. Now it has fallen to Taqizadeh to fill the vacant post in addition to his duties as Minister of Roads and Communications. Taqizadeh knows nothing of finance and his only qualification is his reputation for honesty and integrity. The appointment can then but be for the sake of appearances and to give the Ministry a responsible head to whom the details of its internal affairs can be referred for settlement. 4.

With reference to paragraph 6 of my despatch No. Overseas Trade (B.) 91 of July 14th last, I have the honour to inform you that the Ministry of National Lconomics has issued a statement in the press confirming the reports that have been current for some weeks to the effect that an Italian Company is to erect a cement factory on Persian Government account either at Shah Abdul Azim, 5 miles S. E. of Tehran or Rudehen, a village belonging to the Shah some 26 miles N. E. of I ehran. The cost is to be 180,000 Tomans, of which 45.000 for the actual construction of the factory. The machinery is due to arrive before the end of the Persian year (March 1931) and the Ministry hopes that the factory will be produc- mg 160 Kharvars or approximately 46 tons of Portland cement a day during next summer, without the help of any foreign expert. 2. I am seeking information regarding the name of the Italian Company concerned as well as the terms of payment. 3. I he Ministry’s statement referred to above contains the following pas sage :— “ II n y a pas eu de mises en adjudication pour la raison bien simple que le ministere de reconomie nationale ayant d’ores et deja re 9 U de» propositions de nombreuses compagnies etrangeres, il a choisi cellos faites par ime compagnie italienne, les estimant comme les plus avantageuses, sous tous les rapports.”with, copies of the documents mentioned in the subjoined Schedule, on the subject of Kusso and Turco-Persian frontier situation.

Letter from His Majesty’s Consul, Tabriz, to His Majesty’s Minister Tehran, No. 119, dated the 8th July 1930. Very Confidential, Frontiers Situation. I have the honour to report that the General returned from his last tour of the frontiers on the 6th instant and called here by appointment on the 7th. 2. He describes the situation as still being very strained—the worst he has known in recent years—on the Turkish side as well as the Russian. 3. He has received authority for an interview with the Shah, but told that he can only stay 24 hours in Tehran. He expects to leave on Wednesday and travel all night both ways. 4. Russian Frontier. —There have been no further incidents since the raid of June 3rd, and relations between the Russian and Persian frontier Commissionaries have been renewed. 5. All explanation has again been given to the Russians that the rebel leaders of whom they complained had been arrested long before the raid. All armed Russian rebels who can be found continue to be arrested by the Persians, dis armed, and sent here. The Shahaivans would resist any future Russian Raids. Caucasus .—6. The revolt in Nakchevan is apparently dying down slowlv ; but on the other hand there is a fresh revolt of the Ajar Moslems between Batiim and Tiflis. The Kara Bagh, Daghestan, and all other revolts already reported by me appear to still be in full swing. There is unrest at Tiflis itself ; as well as Baku. Note.—T here was no mail fro pi Europe yegterday again. 7. The General confirmed a story which I had heard, but did not feel certain enough about to include in my Commercial Diary for June. The Russians had brought 35 wagons of sugar to Julfa to barter against live-stock. They, however, at the last moment decided to distribute the sugar throughout the Caucasian revolted districts as a means of pacification and a pioof of their really benevolent intentions towards all who laid down their arms. j here seems little doubt that the Russians are beginning to adopt a more concilia tory attitude where torce alone has not proved, completely successful, _ The fortification of hills around Julfa the General did not consider to be directed against Persia ; but to be a defensive measure to protect the Russian post there against the Rebels. He added that the same defensive measures were being taken by all Russian Posts in disaffected Zones. 8. 1 he General intends to ask the Shah for several more detectives. . He had just learnt that one Maltis, a celebrated G. P. U. leader of Tiflis, had an ived in Tabriz travelling in disguise and with a false passport made out in the name of one Hacobian. The l ersian Consul at liflis is being asked to explain how he came to grant his visa to this individual. It is of interest that Maltis went to stay here at the house of the Ter Minassian 'whom 1 already reported independently as a doubtful character working under the cloak of Persazneft. Ter Minassian is also considered to be a G. P. U. agent, so 1 am now told. 9. Persazneft. As regards Persazneft—upon which I am making a further separate report the General alleges that they are now importing lorries, and are selling them on very favourable terms to their specially selected clients.Two conditions are made, however ■ (0) ^eLTnVhMLT eall ’ t h l0rr y 0wner drop everything Persazneft 7 “ dnVer at the in3tant dl «P Mal of the in TT l0rry mU , St T VeT g0 0Utside the Provinc e Of Azerbaidjan stated that°he LlTeAaASteS Z7Z ' V^’ ^ invasion of Azerbaidjan by Russia. ^ ^ )a,ra,tlve ^ or an eventual npenfy sSg in C r1o“tT- 6 Gen6ral deClareS that the latter has bee “ ''‘'troopITothe RusstnTon^e ' tiSh one ’ “d to rush (b) That if the Russians had any further trouble on the Persian Frontier the y wou ld send down their armoured trains to Tabriz J Turkish Frontier.—The General alleges that the Turks are being incited bv the Russians to pick a quarrel with the Persians. h Dy T l 13 ‘ ^ old . hl 1 m to close the frontier to Kurdish refugees from be g^n by te Turt 8 ' had h 66 ' * hat 4 m ° nths ’ « ^ 14 ' Th ^ Turks ’ h ^ weve r ; /made one small unsuccessful series of attacks over 2 months ago without giving any warning ; and recently again—again with out warning—had started the operations on a larger scale already reported by 15. Simultaneously with the initial small Turkish successes, a Commissioner arrived in the district froni Angora and proclaimed that the Kurds must disarm an su omit to transportation elsewhere—under pain of complete extermination. The result was that tribes, which had long been quiet, also broke into revolt and attacked the Turks in the rear. The latter were now in a difficult position. 16. The west slope of Ararat was in Turkish Territory, while‘the eastern side sloped down towards Persia. Some Kurdish groups retreated southwards parallel to the frontier wdiile some bands actually crossed into Persia. He sent a certain Kurdish Chief named Amir Khan to argue with these refugees, and finally several groups were evacuated towards Teheran, while others were sent back or went back themselves across the frontier. 17. This last has been represented at Teheran by the Turks as connivance or worse on the part of the Persians. They even alleged that one such band of 200 men from Persia had marched 100 kilometres inland and besieged a Turkish post. This the General described as wilful misrepresentation. 18. He argued that if such an attack on a post so far from the frontier was a fact, it could only be attributed to local Kurds. He added that at Erzerum a “ P lot had been discovered and a certain Salaheddin son of Said had been arrested and—accused of having received money from Great Britain. He only quoted this incident as showing that all the Turkish Kurds were now in open revolt or disaffected. 19. He added that the Turks along the Persian frontier had their trenches facing westwards, and not towards Perisa. 20. Copy of this report is being sent to His Makjesty’s Embassy at Angora.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Oepice London, ISio. 278, dated the 24th June 1930. His Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Prin cipal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit here with copy of a note addressed to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs respect ing the commandeering of transport by the Persian military authorities Enclosure in No. 1. Sir R. Clive to Persian Foreign Minister. M. le Ministre, Gulhek, June 24, 1930. As your Highness is aware, the methods employed in the past by the military authorities for the commandeering of transport have given rise to much dissatis faction and resentment and to reiterated complaints of injustice and ill-usage. The various grounds of complaint have been brought to the notice of your High ness s Ministry on numerous occasions, and I will recapitulate them briefly as follows :— (1) No uniform system of requisitioning is in force. (2) No form of receipt is ever given by the officer responsible for the com mandeering, with the result that it is often difficult for the owners of transport to establish the justice of their claims. (3) Even when sufficient evidence is in their possession, the procrastina tion of the military and the delay in settlement are such as to cause very real hardship to the owners concerned. (4) Lorries are often seriously overloaded and driven at excessive speeds over bad roads, with the result that they are often seriously damaged and at times abandoned by the roadside. For such damage the military authorities refuse to accept responsibility, and state that it is covered by the rate paid for the hire of the lorry. (5) Transport is often detained idle by the military for several days, and no compensation is paid for such delays. (6) No discrimination is used by the commandeering officer, so that often all the transport of one owner is taken and none of another owner. 2. Your Highness will agree that such unrestrained and irresponsible re quisitioning gives rise to a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. In all countries the necessity of issuing some form of official receipt, whereby the owner may be assured of receiving his proper hire, is recognised. The refusal of the military authori ties to recognise their responsibility for exceptional damage caused to commandeer ed lorries is also opposed to international practice. It is evident that the forcible requisitioning of a lorry cannot be compared to an ordinary hire transaction, and serious damage sustained by a lorry (whose driver is often replaced by a mili tary chauffeur) in such circumstances cannot be regarded as fair wear-and-tear. 3. The right of any Government to requisition transport in times of crisis is not disputed, although it is, I understand, customary to-issue a public notification of the state of emergency which exists; but it is essential that requisitioning should be carried out in such a manner as to cause the minimum of loss and hardship to transport owners. I have therefore the honour to lay before your Highness certain proposals which would help to ensure that any commandeering that may be neces sary in the future will be carried out in the most equitable way. (1) A fair scale of hire should be drawn up and adhered to. (2) This scale should provide for the payment of hire for every day that the transport, though not actually employed on the road, is detained by the military authorities.116 (3) The military authorities should agree to pay for any exceptional damage caused to lorries while they are employed for military purposes, and for damage to goods dumped by the roadside. (4) On all occasions some form of official requisition receipt or contract should be issued by the officer responsible for the commandeering, so that the Ministry of War may from the outset be put into posses sion of evidence which would enable them to verify the validity of all claims submitted to them. (5) The requisitioning officer should, as far as possible, exercise discrimina tion so that undue hardship should not be inflicted on any one owner of transport. 4. I trust that your Highness will see fit to submit these proposals to the Ministry of War and will use your good offices to secure their most favourable consideration, so that the heavy losses inflicted on transport owners by the present methods may be eliminated and their interests safeguarded.

Forwarded to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla, for information :— Despatch No. 122/1930, dated the 21st August 1930, to His Britannic Majes ty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, Tehran. Letter from His Majesty’s Consul General and Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 122/1930 of 1930, DATED THE 21 ST AUGUST 1930. I have the honour to inform you that the Governor of Bandar Abbas has re fused to recognise the signature of the Head Clerk of the Consulate there in the absence of His Majesty’s Consul, and has referred the matter to Tehran. The question arose over a report of the arrival of one of H. M. Ships, when the Governor returned the letter containing the usual intimation. The Acting Governor of the Gulf Ports was asked whether it was correct for the Governor of Bandar Abbas to refer to Tehran direct and if not whether he had received any communication from him. It was suggested that this was a matter which could be settled between him and myself without the trouble and delay of referring to Tehran. It was pointed out that it had always been the practice in the past, when the Consul went on this annual recess to Karachi for his Head Clerk to sign routine papers for him, and that no objection had ever been made to this by the Persian authorities.The Acting Governor replied that the Governor of Bandar Abbas should cet* tamly have referred such matters to him but he had received no communication on the subject. He promised to make enquiries. In the meantime he suss ed ha the Consul shoj,Id write a etter to the Governor of Bandar Abbas requesting m 1 f 1 r e, k s ' s, ,' naUa : e should be accepted in his absence. His Majesty s Consul was accordingly instructed to do this. The Acting Governor now informs me that tJie Governor of Bandar Abbas had in fact reported the matter to Tehran as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has taken exception to the practice last year. He had admonished the Governor of Bandar Abbas for not referring to him, but since the matter had already been reported to Tehran it could not now be settled here and he suggested that I should refer it to you for settlement with the Persian Government } 7 0U . 1( J re q u fst, therefore, that, if you see no objection, the Persian Govein- ment s u°uld be asked to issue instructions telegraphically that the signature of the Head Clerk signing on behalf of His Majesty’s Consul should be accepted during the absence of the Consul on recess in the future as it has been in the past. I may mention that Mr. Richardson took his Head Clerk with him when he went to say good-bye to the Deputy Governor of Bandar Abbas and introduced him to the latter. It would have been simple for the Deputy Governor to have discussed the matter on that occasion with Mr. Richardson, and informed, him that he had received instructions not to accept the Head Clerk’s signature: Mr. Richardson could then have referred the matter before he left. He however did not do so. (104) (Received on 7th September 1930, with Political Secretary s letter No. 34, dated the 21st August 1930.) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London (No. 307. Confidential), dated the 1st July 1930. His Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and, with reference to Tehran despatch No. 273 of the 16th June, has the honour to transmit herewith copy of two despatches from His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz, respecting incidents on the Russo-Persian frontier. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul Palmer to Sir R. Clive. (No. 107.) Tabriz, June 18, 1930. I have the honour to report that the general returned here from Ahar unex pectedly on the 14th June. 2. Mrs. McGrath—accompanied by Mr. Binns, but not by me or my clerks— interviewed him on the 15th. 3. I saw him alone on the 16th, and he dined here yesterday (17th), while I shall see him again about the 21st, if he returns by then from another visit to the frontiers. 4. The general says that his representatives on the frontier have continued relations with the Russian Frontier Commissars. These latter, as well as the consul-general here and Minister at Tehran, had demanded the arrest of certain refugee leaders. 5. These had long been arrested or kept here under open arrest; and the Russians were informed of this, yet omitted to inform Moscow this although the Russian Commissary at Khudafirin had thanked the Persian there. 6. The raid was avowedly made to arrest these persons wdio naturally could not be found, as they were all in Tabriz. 7. The Russians used collapsible boats ; and surprised the block-houses b} enticing the men—mostly asleep—outside upon pretext of discussing an urgent case of smuggling. MC602FD118 They were arrested half-dressed and unarmed ; but later all were released. The Persian officer arrested was also released. 8. Ghahraman Khan was seized as he had been a Soviet agent, and had not given satisfaction lately. He has now died in prison in Russia—it is reported by poison ; as being a Persian subject, it was considered unwise to shoot him. 9. The Russians advanced only from one point inland and swept the zone already reported. They contented themselves with seizing the block-houses and villages on the river necessary to preserve the rading cavalry from an attack from either flank. 10. The Russian G. P. U., who directed the raid, returned to Baku, while most of the troops have withdrawn—to take part in the repression work in the Zangizur district, especially towards Mighry and Sobi. 11. Continual artillery fire can be heard from Bilasuar in the Kara Dagh opposite the above districts ; and this has, perhaps, given rise to a rumour here that the Russians have raided Bilasuar. 12 . Practically all the hostages taken have been released. Perhaps a dozen persons have been definitely carried off, including one or two of the Russians’ own spies who had been suspected of double-dealing ; and some minor refugee notables. 13. The general is pushing forward the disarmament and arrest of refugees in the Kara Dagh ; and having them sent here. 14. About twenty such persons were marched into Tabriz yesterday. 15. The general added that a Caucasian refugee named Zifikar Bey resisted the Russian raideis. He killed one officer and three soldiers ; and was himself wounded. He escaped and is at present in hiding somewhere in the Kara Dagh. 16. A report from another source declares that the electric light is not turned on now at nightfall in Russian Julfa, and that under cover of darkness the Russians are fortifying this spot. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Consul Palmer to Sir R. Clive. (No. 110. Very Confidential.) Tabriz, June 20. 1930. I have the honour to report that the Soviets are now making overtures to the rebels in the Caucasus highlands, and asking them to lay down their arms and return home. 2. The reply appears to have been a flat refusal unless the policy of nationalisa tion of land and livestock be completely dropped. 3. The Russians have, I am told, about 8,000 troops in the Nakchevan zone, 5,000 to 6,000 in the Zangizur zone and 40,000 at a spot near the junction of the Baku-Julfa and Baku-Tiflis Railways, called Yevlak. 4. In the region of Nakchevan the armed rebels are said to number 3,000; while it would now appear likely that the 1,500 rebel refugees from this district, who had fled to Mount Ararat, have returned to the Nakchevan district before the Turkish attack on Mount Ararat begun. 5. At least one refugee chief—Kerbalay Mohamed, son of Shahsuvar Bey of Nakchevan—received warning of the intended Turkish attack on Ararat. He crossed into Persia with 200 followers about ten days ago, and, after a stay of four or five days, crossed into the Nakchevan district and joined the rebels there. 6. Frequent small attacks are made on the railway and railway guards by the rebels, and one attempt has been made to wreck one of the two armoured trains. 7. Fighting is continuous in Zangizur and there appear to be desertions from the Soviet troops to the rebels. 8. I hear that the Russians have asked at Tehran for the recall of Zafer Dauleh. From the selfish point of view—of obtaining early authentic news I can only say that I devoutly hope that the Russian request will meet with success.9. The general considers that the Aznaft Bureaux which exist now in various ^mfr:^ —al business Td toThe RustnlL 0 * 068 ^ ^ 10. The Armenian archbishop confirmed to me that the Russians were ostensibly lookmg for three refugee chiefs-although it was common knowledge here that these men had long been sent to Tabriz. One was Sultanoff. 11 On the other hand, lam told from a different source that the Russians hoped to surprise also one-Beg Pirimoff, an Armenion who was a colonel in the iiissian army during the war. Lately he had been acting as factor of the Tou- maman family s property in the Kara Dagh, and had also sent in men to pillage in .Russia. 1 6 He was not found by the Russians, but the burning of Toumanian’s villa and burning of certain crops, etc., is now more easy to be understood. 12. I he general also reported to me that a socialistic organisation had been introduced among the porters at Persian Julfa, and the members began to wear distinctive badges. As their numbers rapidly increased, he gave orders for these badges to be removed. 13. The archbishop confirmed the words of the Amir Alam to Mrs. McGrath, and my own quite independent conclusion, that the Persians are supporting the Kurds in Mount Ararat. But he added that the Turks had a finger in the Russian raid on the Kara Dagh, which drew off to the Ahar zone troops which were already being marched towards Maku. 14. Mrs. McGrath was refused a visa to even transit Russia, unless she signed an undertaking not to write upon the Russian situation at all. She would not do this, and the general has made all arrangements for her to leave to-day via Rowanduz. 15. I understand she will go on to Mosul, Nisibin and Angora—to visit Mustafa Kemal. It might seem rather regrettable that the Amir Alam should have been so in discreet with her as to the Persian attitude towards the Kurds of Ararat in view of her forthcoming visit to Angora. (105) (Received on 7th September 1930, with Political Secretary's letter No. 34, dated the 21st August 1930.) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 328, dated the 14th July 1930. With reference to my despatch No. 298 of the 30th June last, I have the honour to transmit herewith the translation of an article which appeared in the Tehran newspaper “ Iran ” on the 10th July which rebuts a report spread by a Turkish news agency that the Persian Government was aiding and abetting the Turkish Kurds in their struggle against the Turkish Government. 2. The “ Iran ” newspaper is used by the Persian Government more than any other Tehran newspaper when the Persian authorities desire to air an opinion seriously, and it may be looked upon as a kind of semi-official organ, and this article is most certainly inspired. 3. I do not doubt that the official view of the Persian Government in the . Turkish Kurd question is exactly as the “ Iran ” depicts it, but I doubt whether the frontier authorities really put this official view into full practice. Persia and Turkey treat their Kurdish population so very differently that it is hard to believe that Persian private opinion is in complete harmony with the official pronounce ment, and can regard Turkey’s treatment of the Kurds as anything but barbarous. Dr. Amir Aalam’s remarks (referred to in paragraph 3 of my despatch referred to above) may be taken as a sample of the individual Persian’s sympathy wuth the Kurdish tribes in their troubles.120 4 Later comments in the Tehran press accuse the Soviets of propagating false news in this connexion with the twofold object of showing up 1 ersia as an un- vror' hy neighbour and of demonstrating a justihcation for them recent nnhtary raid Tn the neighbourhood of Khudaferin. 1 asked the Minister for b oreign Affairs about his this morning, and I found his Highness quite decided in his view that the Soviet Government were trying to stir up trouble between the 1 urkish and Persian Governments by falsely accusing the Persian Government to the links of aiding and abetting the Kurdish insurgents. His Highness went on to speak with consi derable heat of the impossibility of ever dealing with a Russian Government, whether Tsarist or Communist. Both were equally unreliable and untrustworthy. r, Meanwhile, the Persian Frontier Commission, which was to have met the Turks'on the 10th July in order to resume the delimitation of the Turco-Persian frontier, has not yet left Tehran, and the reason for the delay ,s the fighting going on w th the Kurds, although the Turkish mission is said to have started. The members of the mission are very pessimistic of success, as apparently both commis- “on last year came to the conclusion that their views for delimitation were so opposed that the matter would have first to be discussed diplomatically either m Tehran or Angora. The higher authorities, both I ersian and Turk, do not ap parently share this view, but I am informed by a member of the commission that Ft is none the less true. Feroughi, when Ambassador m Angora, appears to have taken Account only of villages m the district in dispute, Raving the question of wavs of communication and rivers to be decided on the spot, and it is in settling o which side these belong that the insuperable difficulty lies lor the members of the commission. , 6. Copies of this despatch, with its enclosure, are being sent to His Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople and to His Majesty’s Acting High Commissioner •frvr Tran Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from the Tehran Newspaper “ Iran dated July 10, 1930. “ The Question of Kurds and the Policy of our Go\ernmeni. Under this title the newspaper in the editorial says :— For some time Turkey, our neighbour, has been occupied with troubles amongst the Kurds. We have been, and are still, sorry for this, owing to tne sincere relations which exist between Persia and Turkey, and we hope most earnest ly that this problem, like other problems which the Turkish Government has suc cessfully grappled with, will be completely solved and settled. About one week ago we published a brief account, translated from foreign papers, of the Kurdish disturbances in Turkey for the information of our honourab e readers, the repetition of which is unnecessary here. But the Anatolia Agency nas recently published a report in this connexion, which has been reproduced m t e vernacular papers of Tehran, and which compels us to write an article on is question. The report was as follows :— “ Khalid Agha, with 100 associates, went to Persia, procured arms and then raided Turkish territory. According to reliable reports received, the insurgents were afiorded facilities openly in Persia, and ra ions are supplied to them from Maku. The publication of this report by the Anatolia Agency is a cause of much r eg re K because it disturbs Turkish public opinion and alarms the Turks, who have alwa) been advocates of strengthening Perso-Turkish political relations. As we o no desire that there should be the slightest misunderstanding between the Persian an the Turkish Governments, we deem it necessary to deny the above report, an complain of the agency in question for publishing this news without making PP?P enquiries as to its authenticity or otherwise, for by such means misunderstanding may arise between the Persians and the Turks, both of whom are anxious mutually sincere and friendly relations. We have made special enquiries into the matter from most reliable interna sources, where the news had caused astonishment mingled with regret, because n only the Kurdish insurgents had not been assisted in Persia, but measures favourthe Turkish Government had been taken by the Persian G measures weie of the following category * overnment. These 1. The Persian Government proposed to the Turkish G tier and take refuge there from Turkish forces. S. To put these measures into execution the Persian Government ordered the i ersian Kurdish tribes to come away from the frontier inside the country so that they may not have any communication with the Turkish Kurds. 4. As a few Kurds who had previously come from Turkey to Persian terri tory had not obeyed orders, the Persian Government had expelled them in consequence. 5. In view of the attention which the Persian Government pays to the Persian Kurds whom it considers as ordinary Persian subjects, the Persian Kurds are not allowed either to aid and abet the Turkish Kurds or to receive the latter as refugees. 6. Our Government has issued instructions to its frontier authorities to co operate with the Turkish frontier agents with the object of creating complete confidence, between the two Governments, and in order to enable the agents of both Governments to take measures with dis cretion and full knowledge of the situation. In short, the Persian Government have treated Turkey sineerety like a brother in this matter, and in view of that we did not expect the Anatolia Agency to publish such a report without previously referring to reliable official sources of news. We, who are advocates of centralisation, and who have been following up this policy for the last fews years in the country ; we, who are always against any kind of internal instigations and who do not allow anybody to make instigations against the interests of the country ; we, who know and have faith in the fact that a country in the first place must establish internal security in order to be able to bring about other reforms ; and who, with this object in view, have used all our efforts during the last few years until at length, through the untiring efforts of His Majesty, we have reached the goal and Persia has become a land of tranquillity and security ; we, who believe in the principle of maintaining friendship and cordial relations with our Turkish brethren—and in support of this we have may proofs—how can any body suspect us of having given refuge to a number of Kurdish insurgents and of having helped them ? Apart from the matter of friendly relations, such an action is in principle contrary to the clear policy and attitude which our Government has adopted. The policy of the Persian Government is a clear and honourable policy which has never- been besmirched by such acts. The report published by the Anatolia Agency is therefore unfounded, and we hope that the said agency will correct this news in the Turkish press and cease to create misunderstandings without reason.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Embassy, Paris, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 939 , dated the 14th August 1930. I have the honour to inform you that the Persian Minister called at His Majesty’s Embassy this morning. He said that he was not acting on instructions but that speaking personally he wished to call my attention to the violation of the Persian frontier by Turkish kroops in pursuit of Kurd elements. 1 he lurkish troops had entered Persian territory. He did not know when they would leave or even whe ther they did not intend to stay indefinitely, Jle thought that the Soviet Government MC602FD122 was behind the Turkish action, as there had, he said, already been a demonstration on the frontier between Persia and Soviet Russia. He said that the Turkish action wouldprobably cause difficulties for the Persian Government with the Kurd ele ments in Persia. 2. He said that he had telegraphed to his Government to know what action ^ they intended to take and he understood the choice lay between asking simply for the sympathy of the other Powers in these circumstances, or of an immediate refer ence of the question to the League of Nations. He informed me that he had yes terday brought these facts to the notice of the French Government, also, I gathered, without any special instructions. He would be grateful if I would report them to you as he stated that at the moment the Persian Minister was absent from London and that yesterday the Persian Charge d’ Affaires there had seemed in some doubt as to what action he ought to take.

Reference Tehran despatch No. 246 of 5th October 1929. [Serial No. (132), File No. 17-N./29.] To the Foreign Office, London, No. 416 of 26th August, 1930, with enclosure. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foregn Office, London, No. 416, dated the 26th August 1930. With reference to my confidential despatch No. 514 of October 5th last, I have the honour to transmit to’you herewith an account* of the proceedings at the second Annual Meeting of the National Bank together with a copy of the balance sheet for the year ending March 20th, 1930. 2. The criticisms directed in my despatch under reference against the balance sheet published for the first six months of the National Bank’s existence apply equally well to the present one which has not been audited and is really incompre hensible. No indication is given of what is accounted satisfactory cover for debts and here again the uncovered portion of the debts is many times as large as the de clared net profit. There is no reserve fund and the carry over amounts to 177,000 Krans only, but this may be due to the fact that the Government, which is the only shareholder in spite of all the propaganda conducted with a view to induce the public to take up shares, insists on a return of six per cent on its money (vide the budget for the current year forwarded to you under cover of my despatch No. 146 of April 5th last). 3. According to this balance sheet the net profit on the paid up capital amounted to 8-2 per cent but no mention is made of ‘ frais generaux, an omission which com confirms the supposition that the Government have undertaken to pay these. In fact the Chief Manager of the Imperial Bank believes that the Govern ment will continue to do so for the first five years. On the other hand the National Bank claims to have paid off the entire ‘ frais defondation et d’inventaire,’ apart from writing fifteen per cent off the value of its buildings. 4. There is no doubt whatever that by far the larger portion of the Bank’s paper profits have been made in the process of robbing Peter to pay Paul, the Per sian Government now paying far stiffer rates to the National Bank for services ren dered than it ever paid the Imperial Bank. Doctor Lindenblatt is also said to resort to all manner of devices in order to swell his profits, such as to delay the payment qf advances to various government departments in the provinces while charging on the overdraft from the receipt of the Treasury’s request to the Bank to effect such advances. The National Bank has admittedly cut into the exchange business of the Imperial Bank ; and it was on Doctor Lindenblatt’s recommendation that the recent law was passed to control all operations in exchange. -—- ♦Not printed.123 0 B f a a n ii r* 111 pro H leraaticaI ,* The Shah is credited young Persians on the staff of the National Ranh ^ ISerS ' lt l,n five P ears and the ledge of banking problems, alreadv a Z an aUituZTotT^' 7 kn ° W - anee.

Confidential, dated the 25th June 1930. His Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Prin cipal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s consul at Tabriz on the subject of the Rowanduz route. Enclosure in No. 1. Consul Palmer to Sir R. Clive, (No. 102. Confidential.) Tabriz, June 11, 1930. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Legation despatches Nos. 19 and 20 upon the above subject. 2. The attitude towards the Rowanduz route here is at present one of extreme enthusiasm and optimism. 3. Timur Bey—the local Director of Roads-—duly went to Iraq w’a this route, despite appalling weather. He-even took his wife with him—ew route to Europe via Nisibin—and both had to travel over two complete days on horseback. 4. To prevent any possible misunderstanding of Timur Bey’s technical capa cities, it may be well to give a sketch of his career at this point:— (a) He was one of the seven graduates of his year (out of 3,000) who suc ceeded in obtaining the degree of “ Doctor of Engineering ” at the University of St. Petersburg.124 (h\ At the of 30 lie was inspector of all the Caucasian railways with the rank corresponding to that of a full colonel. His zone covered Batum-Tiflis-Baku and the lines to the Persian frontier; and he had also been connected for a time—as construction engineer—with the Turkestan railways (Derbent, etc.) (c) He is now 40 years old. (d) He left Russia hurriedly when bolshevism started, and in his present post enjoys the entire confidence of his present Persian superiors. (e) There was even sorne discussion two or three months back 'whether he would not be appointed Director General of Communications for all Persia. 5. Timur Bey is genuinely enthusiastic about the future of the Bowanduz route. He has pointed out— (a) Azerbaijan is tired of Russian attempts at domination, such as restrictions over imports ; refusal to accept the produce of the country (dried fruits) except in limited quantities ; evasions of stipulated conditions as.to payments in kind and so forth. (b) The possiblity of an enormous increase in transit trade via Rowanduz- Timur Bey considers that the tribes of this route remain quiet unless excitedby hostile propaganda, and that Tabriz merchants would be eager to give it a prolonged trial. (c) Besides the inspired articles which have recently appeared in the Tehran press, there have been an equally inspired series of articles in the Soviet press of Tiflis, Batum, Baku, etc. The latter are very pessimistic in tone. They openly speak of the possibility of troop-carrying lorries being rushed up via this route to the Russo-Persian frontier. Timur Bey and the general consider the Russian raid reported in my despatches Kos. 97 and 101 as the natural corrollary of the Rowanduz route. Note,—T his last is his 'weakest point, as it is obvious that if the RoTvanduz route mould render it easy to lend aid to Azerbaijan in case of a Russian invasion, it mould equally render Iraq liable to an invasion by victorious Russian invaders. The question is not dissimilar to that of the Channel Tunnel, which was recent ly decided adversely upon by the Imperial Defence Committee. The Row r anduz route wmild necessarily commit the Iraq Government, in my humble opinion, to the establishment of a really strong covering force at some sui table point of the route until such time as the Soviet Government clearly abandons all intention of aggressions upon its neighbours. The frantic work upon the Baku-Julfa Railway appears to me to be the reply of the Soviets to the Rowanduz route. It is an opinion shared by all thinking persons here, from the general downwards. The Russians have, however, started this railway and mean to terminate it as quickly as feasible ; while from my despatches Nos. 97 and 101 it will be seen that they have—deliberately or not—already tested its possibilites. They will not now stop this construction, even if the Rowanduz route be abandoned. I venture to consider that they have clearly unmasked their batteries, and that they might become more reasonable if the reply were also equally visible. But the route alone, wdthout some covering force, might only prove a temptation and not a defence. In previous reports I took care to say that I was “ not concerned with the strategic aspect of the route,^ but, after the Russian raid of the 3rd June, I should be failing in my duty if I did not at least allude to all eventualities. I may add that the general also declared to me his opinion that the Russian raid was as much due to any real fear of the Rowanduz route as to any real desire to round up militant refugees. It may, however, suit him to promulgate this explana tion of motives. 6. From the mere point of view of simple commercial benefits and constructive possibilities, I venture to consider that Timur Bey has made out a good case, and that Mr. Clay has signally failed to do so.125 comp If one is to believe Timur Bey bp 11 Bagdad, as well asthe engineers upon the route, intoWayTtWnkim 6Very0ne &amp;t route is opened the Iraq ^Government wdM t0 1,6 . tllat fears tllat if a temporary provide further funds for theTmpTete m'im-*! ^ t f h ^’ and n0t be to ''' 8 ■“»' z±i fieoimxszi '»^A'! 3 SssunssK 01 a smailm c^ifbe gSVath^/ 01 ^ CODstructio “ of our own battleships- next yea/the road cLl7L metede^and w'ideued ° f AnS ^ Tlie entirely completed, still within the estimated total of 1,600,000 rupee™ be and all next summL C aii!Tau 0 tumn 0Uld b&lt;!

Timur Bey’s projech-as explained to me on his maps—is as follows •— (a) A car can now reach as far east as Balikian-Diana. (b) Work should be started backwards (i.e., westward) from Raiat. There are about 4 kjlom. of hard work needed here. (c) Between Raiat and Bridge Omeravah five small iron bridges are needed. imur Bey pointed out that the necessary iron girders and concrete were all available instantly. a u Lontrele (d) Between Zaveh and Bridge Omeravah the road must be remade, and this section calls for serious work. (e) A temporary track could be made between Zaveh and Balikian-Diana (/) In all, serious work for some 28 kilom., five small iron bridges and a track for the rest of the route would render the entire route passable for lorries m fine weather. r (n) 1 here are about TO kilom. to complete, of which 28 call for serious work and 42 can be easily levelled sufficiently for use in fine weather. 10. Timur Bey can put his track through to the frontier in two months but yif ft P ? Sed hlS c f edit n0W if ’ on the (ra q side, no junction can be c ffected before 1932. He is of course, responsible to Tehran for effective use made of his credits. He has already proposed to me to—next year—improve the present rough road between here and Haidarabad, and for this year all available money is oeing earmarked for the Kowanduz route. The impression in official circles at Tehran is one of doubt as to whether in t raq they are treating the project seriously or not. Timur Bey further remarked that, if the route were once through, the Iraq government would at once begin to reap the benefit of transit dues—to which the i would apparently willingly agree—and would automatically, despite Mr. Clay s uneasiness, vote the credits for the improvement and permanent organisation of the temporary track, which would already begin to show a source of income. 11. I can only respectfully venture to agree with Timur Bey. The Damascus Bagdad Desert Motor Service started also in a very humble way, and so quite recently did the Mosul-Nisibin-Constantinople route. But experience shows that, if a quick and cheap route is provided, the ad vantages reaped will tend to promote willingness to spend the sums needed for consolidation. I cannot for one moment agree that the Iraq Government, once it begins to reap material advantages from the Rowanduz route, would hesitate to vote MC002FD126 the comparatively small sums required to change the temporary track into an important artery of commerce and travel and a continual source, of profit. 12. Even with a temporary track Bagdad would be brought within approxi mately forty-eight hours of Tabriz. 13. The Director of Iraq Railways told Timur Bey that wdien the route was through he would consider the question of prolonging the railway to Erbil. At present it takes some nine hours by rail from Kirkuk to Bagdad and six hours by car from Mosul to Nisibin, 14. It is clear that the situation may be vastly improved once again, if the Bagdad-Jaffa Railway be built. The Julfa-Batum Railway would become of much less importance and the Nisibin-Constantinople or Nisibin-Alexandretta routes would probably sink into the background where only merchandise is concerned. 15. I respectfully venture to consider that, as regards peace-time traffic, Timur Bey has made out an excellent case for the immediate preparation of a temporary track upon the lines exposed in paragraph 9 above. I have ventured also to point out the possible strategic danger of any Rowanduz rou t e either temporary or completely organised—unless accompanied by a suffi cient defensive organisation. The situation is curiously similar to that of the Dardanelles at the outbreak of the war ; and I could not advise the creation of a possible easy route of access to Mesopotamia for the Russians, unless I had deliberately ventured to draw attention in my humble capacity to this side of the question also. It has been seen tMfe month to what lengths of high-handed action the Russian* are ready to go where a weak nation is concerned. 16. But if it be considered that there be no serious strategic danger to Iraq, I must respectfully submit that from the purely commercial aspect I can only agree with Timur Bey and not with Mr. Clay. 17. A final point—not of sufficient importance to put down earlier—is that the Rowanduz Road would “ tap ” a magnificent range of scenery. There appear to be several waterfalls, ample vegetation, marvellous views and so forth. Iraq has no real summer quarters at present—like (say) Simla—but it would find these ready to hand along this route. Probably summer villas would spring up there, and in due course summer hotels also. From this point of view as well the wealth of Iraq would increase ; while the lives of residents of Iraq and of their families would be rendered infinitely more bearable. The pacific penetration and complete pacification of this Kurdish zone would automatically follow. 18. I will not venture to say more. I agree cordially with Timur Bey as to the immediate commercial advantages of even a temporary track; and I feel equally convinced that Iraq Ministers will see almost at once the solid advantages to be gained by voting further improvements. But recent events and the whole Russian attitude might seem to show that their aspirations for a port on the central seas are no less pronounced than in 1914 ; and a Rowanduz route might offer them a shorter alternative road to the Persian Gul than any other route now in existence. But the above would apply equally—except for the question of date—to a fully organised road like Mr. Clay’s project or a temporary track as suggested now by Timur Bey. 19. Timur Bey told me that he had been very impressed with the waim hospitality shown him eveiywhere, and very grateful for it indeed. I now learn-—from his chauffeur—that Timur Bey has asked his superiors to make him a grant of 100 tomans in order to enable him to invite Hamilton am y or Mr. Clay in his turn to the Persian side. It is hoped that the request will be granted, and the cordial relations alread) established mav be further cemented.the Rowanduz rLtelill' fLS decided , ttat n0 one ca ' u f Ruir^SSab.'fD P T ianS d r ^ Want pr ° greSS e^nmdSy reportedto decision pfobab ^ Dmele y s indiscretions have contributed not a little to this will take to Ws y SayS tLat ’ When finished ’ tte run from Kirkuk t0 Hai darabad (110) Memo, from H.

His Britannic Majesty s Representative presents his compliments ’ to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the subject of the Kurdish situation:— Despatch to the Foreign Office with enclosure No. 431, dated 3rd September* Despatch from H. M. s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 431, DATED THE 3RD SEPTEMBER 1930. I have the honour to report that Memdouh ChevketBey, the Turkish Ambas sador, left lehran on August 31st. His successor is expected in a few days’ time. 2. The day before his departure Memdouh Chevket called to say good-bye and I tried to elicit more clearly the reasons for his re-call or resignation. He gave me to understand that the communiques and press reports emanating from Cons tantinople and Angora had all been highly coloured if not absolutely untrue. He insisted, for instance, that no ultimatum at all had ever been sent to the Persian (rovernment although, according to the press , no less than three had been delivered. He maintained that not one single Turkish soldier had entered Persia nor had the Turkish Government at any time threatened to cross the frontier. I asked him then what was the grievance of the Turkish Government against the Persian Government ? He said they really had none at all except that four years ago two well-known Turkish Kurdish chiefs had settled down on the Persian side of the frontier and in spite of repeated protests from the Turkish Government and the usual promises by the Persian Government no steps had been taken to remove them. On the other hand the rectification of the frontier on the eastern side of Lesser Ararat was essential to Turkey to enable her to control the situation in future. I then asked His Excellency as tactfully as I could whether he had been recalled by his Government or whether he had resigned. He told me that he had resigned. Admittedly at mid-summer his views had not coincided with those of his Government. However he assured me that the Turkish Govern ment now understood the situation and there was no cause of friction between the two Governments. At the same time he was very glad to go ; he had been here five years ; he was not a diplomat by profession and though later on he might be glad to have another post (his ambition, I understand, is to be Ambassador in Moscow) he was quite content to live quietly with his family in Constantinople. His real interests were the study of history and ethnology. 3. Finally I asked him whether in his opinion the Soviet Government had been fishing in troubled waters and whether they were in any way responsible for the un doubted friction which existed between the Persian and Turkish Governments this summer. He denied this absolutely and maintained that on the Russian side of the frontier, although the Armenians as always were a potential source of danger, the Kurds were perfectly quiet and he had no reason to suppose that the Soviet authorities had done anything to stir up trouble. This may be true but there is no doubt that Memdouh Chevket, who was an intimate friend of Davtian, the late Soviet Ambassador here, has very strong Russian sympathies. 4. Yesterday afternoon, in the course of a visit to Teymourtache, I asked His Highness what were his views about the recent Kurdish trouble. He began by discoursing generally on Turkish politics ; he maintained that Ismet Pasha had been the villain of the piece and in order to strengthen his own position in Turkey128 had been responsible for the series of exaggerated press reports from Constantinople Tewfik Rushdi Pasha he had never been able to take seriously. The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs had no convictions and was at any moment ready to adopt a different policy. What he did not understand was the real attitude of the Ghazi who on the one hand had apparently done nothing to stop this anti-Persian press propaganda while on the other he had always spoken in the most fulsome terms of Turco-Persian friendship. As regards Memdouh Chevket’s resignation he maintained that this was undoubtedly brought about by the antagonism of the Turkish General Staff who had accused him of being pro-Persian and of being out of sympathy with the Turkish policy in Kurdistan. 5. His Highness then went on to speak of the Kurdish policy of the three countries, Turkey, Persia and ’Iraq. The policy, he said, was Ifundamentallv different in each country. The Turkish Government under Ismet Pasha franklv wanted to annihilate the Kurds, an impossible policy to maintain as one could not annihilate a whole people. The Persian policy, he admitted, had been in the past to leave things alone; they had done nothing for the Persian Kurds, at the same time they had tried to do nothing to annoy them. The Hraq Government, on the other hand, acting on the advice of the British authorities, had adopted a policy of encouraging the Kurds by allowing them to maintain their language, by promising them schools and in other ways by trying to raise the general standard of living among the ’Iraqi Kurds. This policy, he feared, must in the end have a disturbing effect both on the Turkish and the Persian Kurds, and he said frankly, that he if were a Turkish or Persian Kurd his whole sympathy would be with the policy of the ’Iraq Government; as it was, however, he looked to the future with anxiety and the Shah was undoubtedly perturbed. Although the ’Iraq Government might not be in favour of an united Kurdistan yet their present policy had the appearance of a first step in that direction. Itis 'Highness said that he had read the speeches which Major Young and Jaafar Pasha had recently made in Suleimanieh, and though he quite realised the good faith of the ’Iraq Government and their British advisers in the matter he wished to let me know frankly his own views. He endorsed Memdouh Chevket’s opinion about the correctness of the Soviet Government in this particular question, although he was equally suspicious of the Armenians. 6. Finally I asked him about the question of frontier rectification on Lesser Ararat and whether he thought the Turkish demands were reasonable. He said he was not prepared to express an opinion himself but could only state that the Persian General Staff were most strongly opposed to any concession to the Turkish Government in that region both from a strategic point of view and also because a rectilication of the frontier such as the Turks wished for would be greatly resented by the Kurds and the whole odium would fall on the Persian Government. ^ 7. I enclose copy of the latest report *which I have received from His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz on the Kurdish situation. Postcri])t. September 5th. Since writing the above I have received a copy of Persia despatch No. 939 of August 14th. I have always known Ala, the present Persian Minister in Paris, to be a busy body with little regard for the truth. I need only remind you of his visit to London in the summer of 1929—but his recent gratuitous demarche without ins tructions on the strength of press communiques which it is now known were in accurate and misleading strikes me as amazing. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Con stantinople, the Government of India and His Majesty’s Acting High Commis sioner for ’Iraq. (Initialled) R. H. C. P. S. S. September 8th. In connection with the foregoing I enclose copy of a telegram addressed on September 7th to the *' Times ” by their Tehran correspondent. *From Mx. Palmer, No. 152, dated 25th August 1930.129 Letter prom H. M’s Consul, Tabriz, to H. M’s Minister, Tehran, No. 152 DATED THE 25TH AUGUST 1930. * Subject :— Kurdish situation, 1 on, 1 h r, e ^ e ll0r ' 0 ' r , J° , re ?°y, t tllat 1 llave now 8een Reuter’s telegrams of August 12th ami 14th, giving details as to the Turkish advance into Persian Territory and the proposed exchange of territory. I have also seen the denial of the alleged •• V 1 aC,“ , ,or *■“* -“ M “ w “ 2. On August 1922 I was at a dinner party after which I had a long private TmkSh Consul Oxeneraf 4 * Bey “ tlle 80,1 and confidential Secretary of the The General returned here late the same evening, and appointment on August 24th. spent hours here by 2. The General now declares no actual raid took place, but it is difficult to reconcile this declaration, probably made under orders from Tehran, with his previous circumstancial account of the Turkish entrance into Persian Territory their bombing of Kurds in Persian Territory, and final withdrawal upon his re monstrances and refusal to accept responsibility for the results of their continued action. 4. Moreover, I have no reason to doubt Mr. Ardsroony’s account (obtained from an eye witness) of the Turkish advance towards Bulakbash (paragraph 5 of my report 145). As, moreover, the present frontier passes over the centre of little Ararat (Kuchuk Aghri Dagh), it would seem that, if this Turkish advance into the S. E. corner of the Bayezid plain be admitted, the Persian frontier must have been crossed at a point S. W. of little Ararat. 5. But the operation, if it really took place—as I still see no reason to dis believe—was of small extent; and the position as between the Turks and Persians is now much less strained. 6. The Turks have expressed their satisfaction at the Persian Military action of August 9th. The General admits that one group of his men was surrounded by surprise and had losses before it was relieved ; but he added that the Mustafa Agha killed in this action (my report 149, paragraph 7) had been the leader in the Ergish zone. 7. Sureya Zia Bey, however, expressed satisfaction to me that the Persians had suffered losses, as “ they had egged on Khalid Agha to attack them, but the latter had been driven back into Persia and attacked the Persians who tried to stop his return 8. Kuchuk Aghri Dagh was described to me by Sureya Bey as a bleak rugged and practically uninhabited region, which possesses some strategic importance especially as it offered the Kurds a “ bridge ” to pass from one side of the frontier to the other. 9. The General, however, in common with the Armenian Archbishop and the more influential Persian notables, argued that its cession to Turkey would lead to active Pan-Turk propaganda and an attempt at the pacific annexation of Azerbaidjan. Note.— I might add here that on August 23rd I received^ for the first time, direct from Constantinople via Bayezid, an unsolicited free copy of the Pan-Turkish Odlu Y ourd and the first number of the new weekly paper “ Bildirish ” both of which are published in Turkish by the Party of Azerbaidjan Independence, which is practically identical with the “ Musawat ”. 10. Sureya Bey informed me that the actual Turkish Minister at Tehran had been dismissed for incompetent handling of the Kurdish situation and would be replaced by Colonel Yusuf Bey—who before diplomatic missions to Warsaw and Sofia, had been Mustafa Kemal’s Chief of Staff at the victory of Afion Kara Hissar. The new Minister would at once broach the above question of territorial exchanges * and by offering Persia a section of Kurdistan close to the Kowanduz route, Turkey was showing that she was not opposed to this route from which she would reap some benefit through the new Nisibin-Aleppo-Constantinople railway connection. MC602FD130 U. The General was very scornful about this proposal. He was sure that Persia would never willingly agree to this exchange, and that the Turks could not possibly be favourable to the Rowanduz route, but would prefer their Trebisond routes. He pointed out that there was now an even more serious Kurdish revolt in the Bashkaleh and Shensivar districts—which the Turks had so far kept secret, although they had recently detached about 4,000 men from their Ararat forces to send to this new revolted district. 12. Note. I may here remark that Sureya Bey said that there were two Tabriz-Trebisond routes operable under normal conditions (a) The Southern one via Khoi and Kizil-Dizeh passing South of Bayezid. This is the caravan route. (h) The Northern one via Maku and Buzurgan, passing North of Bayezid. This is the motor-car route. Of these only the southern—or caravan— route is still open, the northern—or motor-car—route having been closed since the operations began. 13. I give below other views of Sureya Zia Bey, with the Generals comments- 14. Turkish Forces.—The 7th, 8th and 9th Army Corps (nominally 6 divisions), and 12 Regiments of “ Frontier Guards ” are being employed ; with 70 aeroplanes. The General says perhaps some elements of the above Army Corps, etc., are being employed ; but some Turkish Regiments were not over 700 strong, and in any case no single complete division appeared to be being used. He had heard estimates ranging from 12,000 to 60,000 troops given ; but actually he did not believe there were more than 7,000 or 8,000 now in the Ararat zone ; and perhaps 4,000 more in the Bash-Kaleh zone. 70 aeroplanes was a ridi culous figure. Note. I reported previously a maximum of 15, of which only 6 had been seen in the air at one time. The General consid6red that the Turks were exaggerating the numbers of their forces, in order to alarm the Persians into more stringent co-operation and added that if they really had the forces alleged, they had proved singularly inefficient against 3,000 to 5,000 Kurdish armed rebels. * 15. Operations. —Sureya Bey said that 7,000 Kurds had been killed at Zilan and Kirgish. When I pointed out that I had heard only 3,000 ; he at once replied. Yes, 3,000 on one occasion, and 4,000 the next ”, I formed—the impression that most of his &lt;£ details ’ were inspired by his wishes, and not based upon anything reliable. 16. Sureya added that no quarter would be shown, even to those who surren dered ; as it was impossible for a modem enlightened Government to permit the continuation of the medieval Kurdish habit of raiding peaceful agricultural com munities. The revolt was nearly crushed, and it might be expected to die out very shortly, as the rebels had no food or ammunition, 17. The General’s comments were that:— There only remained a few weeks more for effective operations, that the Turks had now tried to open pourparlers with the rebels, and that in the winter the Kurds would take the offensive again if negotiations failed. 18. Sureya confirmed that several ^-Turkish Army Officers (most, but not all, of Kurdish origin) had taken sides with the Kurds. He specifically mentioned the Ihsan Nouri reported in my No. 143, paragraph 2. No versions agreed as to the number of rebels. They had been placed at 150,000 (fie., the whole estimated Kurdish population) ! 19. I am more inclined to agree with Sureya Bey when he declared that the Persian losses on August 9th included 2 Persian Officers and 2 senior N, C. Os. killed. He also said that one group of recruits—probably those surprised at 4 a.m. on the 9th—ran away ; but the above officers and N. C. Os. stood their ground and were killed.A „2°. As confirmation of this, it now turns out that the Armenian Officer Aehasi •—alleged to ha\e been killed—is untouched ; while the death of a Lieut. Riza Khan has now transpired. Several wounded have been brought into Tabriz, while there are many severer cases at Khoi. J 21 Frontier Commmion.-Sureya declared that only the Topographical Experts had reached Maku, and that one of these was his cousin. He did not know when the rest would arrive. 22. The General, however, declares that none has reached Maku at all The topographical experts are still on the other side of the Frontier and afraid to cross to meet them owing to the avowed hostility of the local Kurds. They- invited the Persians to cross to meet them, but this had been refused. There was nothing known at all of the main body of the Turkish Commission. 23. To sum up concisely my own opinions, which are not easy to form as may be judged from what precedes :— (a) The Turks have vastly exaggerated the numbers of their forces. (b) There is a fresh serious revolt much further south, which may spread eventually almost to Iraq frontier. (c) The Turks have had no distinct success as yet in the Ararat zone ; and it is admitted that Fevzi Pasha went there upon a tour of inspec tion. (d) The Turkish “ morale ” is not very high at present. (e) There has been some co-operation by the Russians upon the Aralik frontier, (comfirmed by the General). (/) Hostilities cannot last beyond mid-October ; and if no agreement can be reached, the same revolt upon a larger scale may continue during the winter—with the Kurds as aggressors. 24. The following remarks of the General also seem worth noting :— (a) He regrets the recal of the present Turkish Minister, who appeared to him ready to listen to argument. He presumes that this fact did not meet the views of Angora, and, though the Turco-Persian relations have improved since August 9th, he expects tj,iem to become even more seriously strained in 1931, if the revolt continues and the territorial exchange is refused. (b) Very Confidential. —He does not hold a high opinion of the present Persian Representative at Angora—a Charge d’Affaires in rank—as he considers him rather too weak and uninfluential a man for the present juncture. I gathered that a new Minister might quiet possibly be sent there ; and that this point had been actually discussed with Zafar Hauleh during his recent visit to Tehran, (c) He agreed that the Russians could not view the proposed territorial exchanges with equanimity. They had given some support to the Turks recently, but probably out of self-interest as they did not want K urdish bands in the Armenian Soviet Republic. The Russians were, however, irritated by the Musawat propaganda ; and meanwhile were speeding up the construction work on the Baku- Julfa railway. This he was convinced would be finished early in 1931, or at least made quite practicable over its whole length. (d) He considered that this had been a year of extreme anxiety; but he feared definitely that the situation would be even worse and possib ly critical in 1931. (e) Other Zones. The General confirmed that he had drawn a strong cordon across from Sauj Bulak to Sakiz, and added that all was at present quiet in that zone. (f) The situation at apd around Maku was now well in hand ; and, after a few days here, he would visit the Russian frontier again. 25. Copy of this report is being sent to H. M. Embassy at Angora [via Bayezid) and H. M. High Commissioner at Baghdad.132 Copy of telegram sent to ‘ The Times London on 7th September 1930. Press Times. London.

I have the honour to report that I had another interview of over an hour with the ^neral yesterday : the first chance I have had since his return from Teheran. A. Ushnu Zone. 1. Besides Simko, Khurshid-Agha, the Chief of the Harki Tribe, was killed. Note.—I am told by others that this latter was killed when he came to collect Simko’s body for burial. 2. The General is not very alarmed at the attitude of Simko’s 17 years old son. He thinks he will submit, accept a pension, and settle down. 3. Most of the Harki Tribe are divided between Iraq and Turkey, and only a small part remain continuously in Persia. . Usually the Iraq portion comes to Ushnu for summer pasturage ; but this year Gie Turkish portion came also, as they had shot some Turkish gendarmes'and generally made Turkey unsafe for themselves. Maku Zone. 4. Many of the Kurds from Mount Ararat were pursued nearly 10 kilometers into Persian Territory bv the Turkish troops, and bombed there by Turkish aero- pia les. Mceo27D134 / TLe Jalali Kurds rallied to them, and the General sent orders to sug^t to th Turks that they withdraw. Otherwise, he argued, the Persian Kurds and tr&lt;JZ might combine to attack the Turkish Columns. He added that he would deal with the situation if the Turks withdrew • h would accept no responsibility for any incidents otherwise. ’ DUt 2. The Turks then retired, and the General gave the Kurds from Turker 9 hours to return to Turkey, or to disarm and be despatched elsewhere in Persia 6. About 200 recrossed into Turkey, but the rest stayed and did not disarm - being encouraged by the Jalali. ' ~ arm , They were then attacked by the Persians.

CoMCrts^iS.—The Caucasus Battalion (centre Baku)—which had not given satisfaction, owing to luke-warmness and even desertions-had been entirely wdh drawn and sent elsewhere-probably Siberia. J h ' 'i he Commander of this Bolshevik division is still Colonel Shamseddin—the ZdaM Relenf Sh n° f Nak “ heVan wh ° untl1 recently commanded ^ Aradabu Kegiment. Shamsuddin is of course accompanied by a “Commissar.’’ - - p° rn P lace thl f ^vision, several pure Eussian divisions have been brought into the Caucasus, and the I ersian Consul at Nakchevan reports that (а) There is a big concentration of troops there again. (б) That at a recent fete the Bolshevik speaker declared that * “ Nak chevan is the gate of the East.” 21. In view of the above attitude and large increase of forces, Zafer Dauleh expressed to me his extreme uneasiness. i x A? a g ree(i that th *y were making a clean sweep of the un uly Kurdish leaders but tins only meant changing a previous peaceful state into a new state of hostility with the Kurds. y 22. Moreover neither the Turks nor the Russians were willing to bo satisfied From Moscow they had for instance telegraphed to Teheran that the Persians had 5,000 men at Julfa :—which was absolute nonsense. Xote. —There may be 200 or 250 there now. 23. Some days ago he marched a regiment from Julfa to Maku by a new path running along the cliffs on the south bank of the Araxes. It was much shorter than via Khoi—being only about 120 kilometers—and as it had been considered too rough to be practicable, he wanted a report upon it. The regiment was in full view of the Russians, who promptly manned the other bank, caused their armoured trains to circulate night and day, and extin guished all lights at night—even in Russian Julfa itself (as I reported some days ago) 25. At this point I asked Zafer Dauleh if it were not true that the strength of the “ Tibs was being steadily increased. He replied that this was so. At Teheran a Tib already numbered 12,000 men ; while upon my arrival here in November 1929, a Tib only numbered 5 000 to 6,000 men. They now numbered 8,000 to 9,000 ; and as more and more conscripts (already registered but not yet with the colours) could be called up, they would eventually reach a full complement of 15,000 each Tib, i.e., with 3 Tibs the N. W. Army would amoimt to 45,000 men. Note 1.—Another officer had previously quite independently informed me that the Russians had brought 60,000 troops down to places along this frontier. Note 2.—Still another Officer had informed me that the Tib would shortly be increased to 12,500 men (i.e., 37,500 men for this Army). He added that the old class of sokliers (now mostly disbanded) used to receive as pay 30 krans 12 shahis each a month, whereas the new conscripts only receive 7 krans 10 shahia a month, the saving effected over pay would allow for the above increase in personnel. Note 3.—It has been found necessary to appoint a Commandant to command the conscripts (I presume a Recruiting Depot Commander), and Sarhang Zaman Khan—who retired about 4 years ago—has assumed this post, which was filled for a short time by Sarhang Mehdi Khan. 26. The above notes would all seem to confirm the intended increase of this army, and I suggested to the General that the increase of the Russian Army of the Caucasus might merely be a reply to this.136 27. To conclude I gathered that Zafer Dauleh was not very pleased with his reception in Teheran ; but he had received sin.ce a telegram from the Shah con gratulating him over the Simko affair. I consider that he is sincerely worried at present. He had had that morning still another call from my Russian Colleague ; and I left as he was expecting another call from my Turkish Colleague. 28. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that the Turks and Russians are in fact working together, and I find it almost impossible to give a clear picture of the situation unless I give details as to both frontiers together. 29.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 460, dated the 23rd September 1930. I have the honour to inform you that an agricultural section of the National Bank was opened on September 20th. Its activities are to be governed by a law passed on August 31st, the text of which is enclosed.* It is only now, there fore, that the National Bank, which was originally intended to be to a great extent an agricultural bank, is to pay any attention to agricultural development. 2. The initial capital set aside for the purpose amounts to five hundred thous and Tomans (Tomans 500,000), but this is to be increased by an additional sum of five hundred thousand Tomans (Tomans 500,000) every year for ten years—- if the money can be found. It is too early to speak of its likely benefits to the country, but one may feel justified in believing that influential landlords will find it easier to secure loans from the bank than their more modest, but perhaps more needy neighbours. The capital of the bank, moreover, will probably be very quickly tied up, particularly if Article 14 regarding the creation of “ industries useful to agriculture ” comes into play. 3. The difficulty associated with the insecurity of land tenure has been over come by prescribing (in Article 6) that loans will only be made to owners or tenants of registered property. This proviso should help to accelerate the process of registration which has gone forward extremely slowly, particularly in the pro vinces. 4.

With reference to my despatch No. 431 of the 3rd instant (enclosure of Serial No. 110), I have the honour to report that Ridvoubeg Oglou Husrev Bey, the newly appointed Turkish Ambassador to this'Court, presented his credentials on the 15th instant. 2. During an interview which Husrev Bey granted to a representative of the “ Iran ”, His Excellency is reported by that newspaper as having referred to certain rectifications of the Perso-Turkish frontier which are now spoken of . These rectifications, he stated, consist of the exchange of the Aghri-Dagh region, a barren tract of lava ground which has no value agricultural or otheiWise for Persia, for certain fertile tracts of land towards the South which would be of great MC602FD * not printed.m advantage to Persia. By this exchange, Turkey would have the advantage of being in a strong strategical position for the pursuit and punishment of the^ebel Kurds. 3.

(Enclosure in Tehran despatch Xo. 461, of 23rd September 1930 ) Extract from Tabriz Political Diary and Military News, No. 8, period from August 7th to September 6th, 1930. Kurdish Situation. \ 14. A. On Turkey. —After hearing and reading various exaggerated state ments of the numbers of the Turkish I have preferred to accept the version of the General, and of usually well informed persons like the Armenian Archbishop and Mr. Ardsroony, that the Turks have 7,000 to 8,000 men around the Ararats and 4,000 men maximum from Bashkale and Shemzinan southwards—to deal with a new revolt in this district. They appear to have 15 aeroplanes of which never more than 5-6 operate at one time. At least five aeroplanes appear to have been lost by them. 15. All reports show the Kurds to be well armed and to be fighting desperately, and the Turks appear to meet with little serious success. 16. An attack made from Aralik southwards failed, and the Turks even lost their original 2 posts in the Aralik plain and were driven across the Araxes into Russia. 17. There they were treated as guests, and their arms, which were at fint taken away, were returned them and they recrossed towards Igdir two days later. 18. It is believed here that the Russians are co-operating with the Turks : and it is even said that the Turkish reinforcements which made the above attack from Aralik had reached their point of departure through the territory of the Armenian Soviet Republic. 19. I cannot altogether disbelieve this, as there appears no doubt that a mysterious force of unknown cavalry passed 2 nights near Davalu and then was behe\ed to have crossed the Araxes. This force was originally reported to me as 20. The Russians have strong forces near Igdir and Davalu and along the Araxes, and it is again alleged that some of their troops join in the fighting against 21. On September 3rd it was reported to me that on August 22nd the Turks made 3 further attacks on Ararat and were each time repulsed with losses. 22. The General informed me that he was sure the Turks had opened negotia tions, and that if these failed, as they probably would, the campaign must stop Kdore November and the Kurds would then resume their forays on neighbouring Turkish villages. J o » He quite expected to see all Kurdistan from Ararat to the Iraq frontier in arms next spring. % 23. The conviction here is that the Turkish “ successes ” near Ergish and Zilan were really gained over a few armed men and a large percentage of non- combatants. ^4. In Persia. Northern Zone. — On August 9th, at 4 A. m. a band of some f 00 t0 300 , Kurds escaping from the Ararat zone crossed into Persia and tried o surround a small Persian Post. There was a panic ; and the soldiers, mostly conscripts, i&lt;m away. Iheir two officers and two non-commissioned officers resisted and were all killed.in aid C tZ T b ° th in J cludin g K1 &gt;alid Agha of the Jalali in aid of the Kurds. The Kurds were finally driven back to the hills near Maku. The e sian osses were probably 100 killed and wounded : and several wounded have since come in here, while severer cases remain at Khoi. ThCiKurdish losses were also considerable and included Hassan Agha-the uncle of Khalid Agha—and Mustafa Agha who had been the leader of the revolt near iiirgisn. i TI ; e J U ^l haVe Persians for their co-operation hut private ly declared that they were delighted at the Persian losses, as the Persian had 011 Khahd Agha to attack the Turks, and had eventually been“ hoist with their own petard . 26. The idea of a rectification of frontiers embracing the surrender of the eastern slopes of Little Ararat to Turkey is hotly rejected by all influential 1 ersians, who declare such a surrender would mark the beginning of intensified Pan-lurk propaganda and pave the way for an eventual invasion—pacific or otherwise. r 27. The raid of the Turks into Persian territory has been officially denied by the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs ; but such circumstantial reports of the bombing of Kurds in Persian Territory, of ah advance of 10 kilometres into Persian Territory, of his representations urging the Turks to withdraw, etc., had been previously given to me by the General that I cannot attach the very least faith to the official Dementi. Further Mr. Ardsroony gave me circumstantial details of the Turkish opera tions from Bayezid towards the Persian frontier and of their intention to occupy Bulakbash. 28. Troops from Tehran .— On August 14th it was reported to me that troops were expected here from Teheran en route to Maku. None ever appeared, but:— 29. In Persia. Southern Zone .—The General confirmed that he had stretch ed a strong cordon from Sakiz to Sauj Bulak. It seems quite possible that troops may have been moved towards Sakiz from outside Azerbaijan. (120) Memorandum from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 175, dated the 13th September 1930. His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the subject of the Bakhtiari situation :— Despatch No. 44, dated the 5th September 1930, from His Majesty’s Acting Consul General at Isfahan. Copies have been sent to the Foreign Office. Letter from His Majesty’s Consul, Isfahan, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 44, dated the 5th September 193,0. The course of recent events in the Bakhtiari and neighbouring areas has perhaps been of sufficient interest and importance to justify a special despatch and I have the honour to submit herewith a narrative of the operations. It is compiled from information obtained from various sources not all of which were very reliable but I hope that it is in the main accurate. Two great difficulties have impeded my compilation ; first the fact that hardly anybody has any real idea of how things are going, as all reports appear to be transmitted direct, and with secrecy, to Tehran and nowhere else ; and second the suspicion with which any manifestation of interest on the part of consular officers is regarded by all in authority. Up to the present, however, I have not heard it said that the present rebellion is instigated by the British.2. At the beginning of August last a certain number of government troop,«? were being concentrated at Urujin from Isfahan, for despatch against the Boir Ahmedi tribe. Fighting with the Hamassanis was also in progress. A collection of Qashqai tribesmen, under Malik Mansur Khan, one of the sons of Soulet-uck Douleh, was collected at Semirum and went off to engage the Boir Ahmedis from the north and north-east. Meanwhile a force of regular cavalry from Abadeh under Sardar Bahadur went to attack the tribe from the east, and fighting commenced in the vicinitv of the high mountain Kuh-i-Dina, particularly round the village of Pa-Dina ait its foot. The Minister of War, Sardar As’ad Bakhtiari, was also sent in person to his own tribe in order to raise a picked force from the Bakhtiaris to co-operate in the attack on the Boir Ahmedis from the north and north-west. He arrived in Bakhtiari on the 7th August and lost no time in convening the heads of the tribe at Chigha-Khur and getting as many tribesmen as possible to offer themselves to deal a blow at the tribe which in the past had caused the Bakhtiaris not a little damage in various raids, to which the latter, not being fully armed, could not easily retaliate, The Bakhtiaris were flattered by the arrival of the Minister of War among them in person ; their enthusiasm for the fight was increased by a supply of about one thousand rifles sent for them by the Govern ment, as well as a certain amount of money; and the necessary number was soon obtained, I happened to be in Sardar As'ad’s village on the 12th August and saw the standard bearers of the Baba Ahmedi sub-tribe with their flags moving off to cheer on the members of that sub-tribe in their march from Clngha-Khur ; the Minister of War also sent for two lowg-oherished silver maces stored in his house for many past generations, 3. Sardar Bahadur’s force was at Hanna on the 11th August, and the Qashqai force was then reported to be advancing with little opposition into the territory of the rebel tribe, Meanwhile the Government forces which had been sent against the Hamassani tribe were coming up from the south, and on the 18th August the Boir Ahmedi area was reported to be almost surrounded by the combined forces. Nasir Khan, another of Soulet’s sons, captured Tul-i-Safid. an important pass ; and Sardar Bahadur’s force then prepared to attack Sisakht, where one of the most important of the Boir Ahmedi leaders, Mulla Qubad, was stationed with about two thousand men, 4. On the 17th and 18th August several motor-lorries passed through Isfahan from Tehran, bearing 800—1,000 troops of the Nadiri regiment, as well as ammuni tion and two mountain guns. The Bakhtiari force moved off at about the same time, accompanied by the Minister of War in person, with several other Khans. The Bakhtiari force had been given formal permission by their Khans to loot anything they could find of the enemy’s goods or cattle ; and pay at the rate of four krans a day for infantry and six for mounted men was promised. 5. On the 2oth August a report was received that Mulla Qubad’s force had not then been engaged ; and that during some of the fighting a Boir Ahmedi force had feigned defeat and fled, leaving poisoned food behind them which was eaten, by the attackers, causing some deaths. Sisakht was however occupied at about this time, and the Bakhtiaris were engaged with the enemy on the slopes of the Kuh-i-Dina and round the Tang-i-Khirsan, behind Fala-rd. In the passage of a river one or two of the Bakhtiaris lost their lives, but the Boir Ahmedis seem to have had the worst of the fighting, or else to have lost heart. Sardar As’ad, stationed on the 28th August at QaPeh Chinar near the Tang-i-Khirsan, sent a message to the Bakhtiaris in Isfahan, delivered by telegraph, saying that three of the most important Boir Ahmedi Khans, named Shukrullah Khan Garmsiri, Mulla Qubad and Qaid Nasir, had surrendered in person, and that Sartip Khan, nephew of Shukrullah, had sent a message to Sardar As ad surrendering completely on the sole condition that the Minister of War would give him a personal safe-eonduct that his life would be spared. 6. If the foregoing reports are true it seems that the principal Boir Ahmedi Khans have submitted, and the Government measures have so far been success ful. No news has yet reached me concerning the result of the operations against the Hamassanis ; presumably the combined forces at the disposal of the Govern ment will now be turned on them. The Bakhtiaris appear to have done well and it may be hoped that as a result the relations of that tribe with the central govern ment will be improved. It was bold and somewhat dangerous experiment on the government’s part to arm them only a year after the Bakhtiaris had themselves been actively at war with the Government,7. A copy of this despatch is being sent to His Majesty’s Acting Consul at Shiraz. (121) Memorandum from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 176, dated the 13th September 1930. His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the subject of employment of Dutch tea experts;— Mr. Lingeman’s despatch No. Overseas Trade fB) 129, dated the 13th September 1930, to the Department of Overseas Trade. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. Overseas Trade (B) 129, dated the 13th September 1930. Early in 1929 Kashif-us-Sultaneh, a Persian prince who had specialized in the cultivation of tea in Gilan, was sent the whole way to the Far East, together with one Protiva the son of a local Czechoslovakian horticulturist, to engage some tea experts from either Japan or China. He returned with four Chinamen who can have been little better than peasants, or tea cultivators, as they are called here. 2. Bills have now been passed for the employment of two Dutch experts for six months—one, Mr. Raynes, has already been engaged, according to the press—and another Chinaman. A credit of 12,000 Tomans (£2,000) has been opened for the salaries and travelling expenses of the Dutchmen, while the China man is to be given $80 per mensem pZits 500 Tomans for his travelling expenses. 3. The exchange crisis has certainly impressed on the Persian Government the need of making Persia as self-supporting as possible and the authorities are inclined to be a little over-optimistic regarding the ease with which this praise worthy aim can be achieved, even where foodstuffs which might be produced economically in Persia^ are concerned. I may be permitted to remind you in this connection that Persian imports of Sugar and tea in 1928-29 were valued at £2,021,049 and £1,432,605, respectively. 4.

Details of the measures adopted to this end in 1928 were communicated to you in the enclosures to Sir Henry Dobbs’ confidential despatches No. 1633 dated the 14th July, and No. 1825, dated the 10th August 1928. The Minister of Court might, perhaps, be reminded in particular of the incident described in para graphs 11 and 12 of the fonner. Moreover, it was as the direct result of the special representation made from this High Commission that His Majesty’s Government issued to all passport officers in February 1029 a special list of Kurdo-Armenian Nationalists to whom visas for Iraq should be refused. 4. I think that if His Highness the Minister of Court is reminded of these facts he will have little reasonable ground for continuing to entertain the suspi cions which he has expressed regarding the attitude of the British authorities in Iraq towards the movement for an independent Kurdistan. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. (73) {Received on 13th Jidy 1930 } with Political Secretary s letter No. 26, dated the 26th June 1930.)

The cloth, both woollen and cotton, produced in Persia is very loosely woven, and the clothes made from it are not suitable for sedentary occupations, for, after a few days' wear, the trousers sag at the knees and the coats both crumple up and sag at the elbow's. At the official Salaam on the 24th April- the anniversary of the coronation—it w'as only too ohvious that the Shah w T as himself wearing a uniform of Persian cloth. 3. T he Government is trying in every w'ay to restrict operations which require the purchase of foreign currency, and the publication of this order at the present time is e^ idently intended as a hint to the local importers of foreign cloth that they will do well to restrict their purchases in view' of the probability of dwindling sales m the future. I nless, howrever, greater efforts are made to produce cloth of better quality than has so far been possible, it is unlikely that the importation of foreign cloth will seriously diminish, and I imagine that Government employees w ill still continue to wear clothes made of imported cloth outside their offices and keep an office coat, and perhaps trousers, of Persian material for use in Office.

(75) Memorandum from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 98, dated the 24th June 1930. His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretap- to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the sub ject of the commandeering of transport by the Persian military authorities:— To the 1 ersian Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated 24th June, 1930. Note Copies have been sent to F. 0., Baghdad, Hamadan, Shiraz, Kennan, Sistan, Duzdap, Ahwaz, Bushire, Kermanshah and Isfahan. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated the 24th June 1930. As ^ our Highness is aware, the methods employed in the past by the Military Authorities for the commandeering of transport have given rise to much dissatis faction and resentment and to reiterated complaints of injustice and ill-usage. 1 he various grounds of complaint have been brought to the notice of Your Highness’ Ministry on numerous occasions, and I will recapitulate them briefly as follows :— (1) No uniform system of requisitioning is in force. (2) No form of receipt is ever given by the officer responsible for the com mandeering, with the result that it is often difficult for the owners of transport to establish the justice of their claims. (3) Even when sufficient evidence is in their possession, the procrastination of the Military and the delay in settlement are such as to cause very real hardship to the owners concerned. (4) Lorries are often seriously overloaded and driven at excessive speeds over bad roads with the result that they are often seriously damaged and at times abandoned by the roadside. For such damage the Military Authorities refuse to accept responsibility and state that it is covered by the rate paid for the hire of the lorry. (5) Transport is often detained idle by the military for several days, and no compensation is paid for such delays. (6) No discrimination is used by the commandeering officer, so that often all the transport of one owner is taken and none of another owner. 2. Your Highness will agree that such unrestrained and irresponsible requi sitioning gives rise to a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. In all countries the necessity of issuing some form of official receipt, whereby the owner may be assured of receiving his proper hire, is recognized, The refusal of the Military Authorities80 to recognize their responsibility for exceptional damage caused to commandeered lorries is also opposed to International practice. It is evident that the forcible requisitioning of a lorry cannot be compared to an ordinary hire transaction, and serious damage sustained by a lorry (whose driver is often replaced by a military chauffeur) in such circumstances cannot be regarded as fair wear-and-tear. 3. The right of any Government to requisition transport in times of crisis is not disputed although it is, I understand, customary to issue a public notification of the state of emergency which exists ; but it is essential that requisitioning should be carried out in such a manner as to cause the minimum of loss and hard ship to transport owners. I have therefore the honour to lay before Your Highness certain proposals which would help to ensure that any commandeering that may be necessary in the future will be carried out in the most equitable way. (1) A fair scale of hire should be drawn up and adhered to. (2) This scale should provide for the payment of hire for every day that the transport, though not actua ly employed on the road, is detained by the Military Authorities~ (3) The Military Authorities should agree to pay for any except onaTdamage caused to lorries while they are employed for military purposes, and for damage to goods dumped by the roadside. (4) On all occasions some form of official requisition receipt or contract should be issued by the officer responsible for the commandeering, so that the Ministry of War may from the outset be put into posses sion of evidence which would enable them to verify the validity of all claims submitted to them. (5) The requisitioning officer, should, as far as possible, exercise discrimina tion so that undue hardship should not be inflicted on any one owner of transport. 4. I trust that Your Highness will see fit to submit these proposals to the- Ministry of War and will use your good offices to secure their most favourable consideration, so that the heavy losses inflicted on transport owners by the present methods may be eliminated and their interests safeguarded. (76) Memorandum from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 104, dated the 30th June 1930.. His Britannic Majesty's Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the sub ject of the Affairs of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Reference:— Despatch to the Foreign Office, No. 302, dated the 30th June 1930. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office,. London,. No. 302, dated the 30th June 1930. With reference to my despatch No. 251 of the 10th June [Serial No. (78)] en closing copy of a personal letter which I addressed to the Minister of Court in regard to the continued bad faith shown by the Shah and the Persian Government towards the Sheikh of Mohammerah, I have the honour to enclose copy of Teymourtache’s reply and of a further letter which I have addressed to His Highness. 2. My chief object in writing my letter of June 25th was to place on record in writing the reasons why His Majesty’s Government were justified in interesting themselves in the fate of the Sheikh, besides correcting certain obvious inaccu racies in Temourtache’s letter. I do not anticipate, however, any satisfaction to the Sheikh himself from this correspondence as I am convinced that Teymour- tache is afraid of representing the matter forcibly to the Shah. As a last hope I have now invoked the aid of Mostofi, a man who has been many times Prime Minis ter, is a personal friend of the Sheikh, and in his capacity as a sort of Elder states-106 Hamadan Vice-Consular district, I have the honour to inform you that besides seek ing the views of His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah on these proposals, I decided to'wait until the effect of the new Khoremabad road could be estimated before deciding to whom the district of Luristan should be allocated. 2. I am now of the opinion that Luristan should be added to the consular district of Ahwaz. The province is being brought within e^y- access of Ahwaz by road and as means of communication improve it seems probable that firms in Khuzistan will open branches in Dizful. It will therefore be easier to obtain information regarding Luristan from Ahwaz than at any other Consular post. I submit therefore that the three Consular districts in question should now be defined as follows :— Ahwaz.—'Yhz provinces of Khuzistan and Luristan. Hamadan. —The province of Hamadan, the district of Garoos, the districts of Malayir, Tusirkan and Nehavand, known as the Triple Govern-: orate, and the distr r ct of Assadabad. Kermanshah .—The province of Kermanshah, Kurdistan and Pusht-i-Kuh. 3. Should these proposals meet with your approval I have the honour to request that fresh royal commissions may be issued to the three consular officers concerned.

His Britannic Majesty's Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the sub ject of the political and military situation in Fars:— Shiraz despatch No. 27, dated July 19th, 1030, N.B. —Copies have been sent to the Foreign Office. Letter from His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, to His Majesty s Minister Tehran, No. 27, dated the 19th July 1930. In continuation of my despatch No. 25 of the 9th July last on the subject of the political and military situation in Fars province, I have the honour to inform you that according to report fighting has commenced between the Amir Lash at Habibullah Khan Shaibani and the Mamassani tribesmen in the Ardakan area. It appears that Imam Quli Khan, the Mamassani leader, frightened by the adven of the Amir Lashkar in person at the head of such a large military ^ orce ’. 0 ^ er ^, ° come to terms with the Persian Government without fighting. The Amir Lasnkar however replied that he had come not to negotiate but to fight. Information as to the extent of the hostilities which have actual y taken place and as,t° f e1 ^ outcome is not yet to hand. It is known however that the Government troops have been suffering from the heat and from lack of supplies in the locality in w ic ^ they are operating. Two thousand mules were hurriedly command eere 111Shiraz on Thursday, July 17th, and despatched to Ardakan laden with rations. An Axmy aerop 1 ane also flew out to Ardakan this momin' and returned to. Shiraz. The chief of the Army Medical Service in the South, Colonel Karim Khan Medayat, was a so summoned to Ardakan urgently on July 17th. 2. There is rumour that the Saulet-ud-Dauleh, who is with the Qashqai tribes in their summer camping-ground in the Semiran district, is not finding it easy to enlist Qashqai levies to assist the Government troops in their fi^ht against the Mamassani and Boir Ahmadi tribes. On the contrary it s said that some of the Qashqais have openly expressed their sympathy with the tribes and have even gone off to join forces with them. It is therefore, in my opinion, not to be expected that the Qashqais, with div'ded counsels and no real wish for war after their strug-. gle of last year, will play any important part in this year’s campaign either for or a^a nst the Government. 3. - Prom Eastern Pars it is reported that the situation is now much easier. Co’onel Zia-ud-Din, Commandant of the Salahenur Regiment of the Pays Com posite Brigade, is understood to have advanced with some 500 men from basal to the vicinity of Lar town, where he has occupied an solated hill which commands the town. Zahdun Khan with his fo lowing of 3,000 rebels has abandoned Lar and retreated towards the mountains, \avar Muhammad Taqh K.h^n ra ’ e Governor of Lar, whom the rebels had isolated w th a small fofce, is understood to have re-established communication with his mam force and s now regarded as out of danger. 4.

The Governor General has complained to His Majesty's Consul against the proselytising activities of certain Persian members of the C. M. S. He stated that the Persian Government objected to such activities—that if they existed in the past it was due to Persia’s weakness—but that now things had changed. It appears that the recent convers : on of two military bandsmen has brought matters to a head. The two delinquents were arraigned under a charge of attending church in other words a public meeting, which apparently Persian soldiers are prohibited from doing. They were to have been flogged but the Bandmaster got the sentence reduced to simple imprisonment. The last time that the question arose was in 1923, when His Majesty’s Consul, Colonel Haworth, reported the matter in the Diary in the following words :—• “ There is a certain amount of feeling about the recent conversions and the Governor General spoke to me on the subject. He pointed out that under the letter and the law any man converted was liable to the death penalty and that conversion was against the charter of the missionaries.” MC445F D—37—25»9*30—GIP3&gt;r*vJ u-v&gt;.

His Highness stated that he would have taken steps to stop the pilgrimage this year had he realised how much money the pilgrims took out of the country. The pilgrimage, he added, would certainly not take place next year if he had anything to do with it. 2. The Minister of Court estimated the exchange bought by Persian pilorims this year at £ 250,000. The Tehran Manager of the Mesopotamia Persia* Corpo ration thinks this an exaggeration and puts the figure at £ 150,000, about four thousand pilgrims being involved 3.

Defective coin and pilgrim traffic. —As mentioned in para. 1 of Meshed Com mercial Diary for February 1930, the Persian Government transferred the right of collecting defective coin from the Imperial Bank of Persia to the National Bank. Towards the end of March the National Bank found that the monopoly con ferred on them was rather a doubtful benefit as they were quite unable to produce rupees in sufficient quantity to meet the demand of the pilgrim traffic and were in the end compelled to suspend business altogether. The more clamorous pil grims were got rid of by being offered kran drafts on the Duzdap branch of the National Bank and the rest were then sent away with the promise that rupees would be available in ten days time. The financial reputation of the National Bank has not been improved by these methods. (48) Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 62, dated the 4th May 1930.

The buiden o ( care er it was the that it was a charge faked by his enemies and that maU “g ca on first time that he had ever been accused of accepting a ■ t him was the gravity of the accusation which if i wa P progress made by Persia given would deal him a mortal blow.

The Court then adjourned stating that the verdict would be announced 6 P ' At 6 p. m. the court room was crowded with representatives of aU classes of society but as the hours passed and the judges no a PP® ar judges finally these who had been waiting dispersed until at 11 p. whe “ ac £ lse g d wa s not appeared not more than three hundred people were P^f*. d T , h v e 5 s C j a ^ ers . brought to the court to hear the verdict but was represented by his lawye 8. It took nearly an hour to read the verdict under '' * ll&lt; f '' Tomans condemned to four months simple imprisonment, payment of a fine five thousand eight hundred and eight and the loss of all civil rights. 9. As according to the law the fine is fixed at three times the amormto^ ^ bribe received, Prince Firuz was found guilty of having receive y^ amount thousand nine hundred and thirty six which is considerably le that they stated by the Public Prosecutor. The judges stated m t , amounts did not find it necessary to express themselves on the question of the amoi alleged to have been received before the law came into operation. 10. There is much speculation as to why judges took such an inor na long time to decide on their verdict and the punishment, there arerumours of a lack of unanimity amongst them, but the verdict as given was un animous although a majority vote would have sufficed. More details may trail, spire later. In any case no one believes for a momentthat the case would ever have been brought into Court without the Shah’s instructions nor would the ver dict liave been pronounced without His Majesty’s Approval. rh i\ 1S ^ me history of modern Persia that a high Govern ment omcial has been prosecuted for an act of which very few Persians can be said to be guiltless and it wall undoubtedly serve as a precedent. Apart from its general interest as showing the evolution of this country there is a special aspect which will interest His Majesty s Government; I refer to the question of the high British decoration which Prince Firms holds. 12. Article XX\ 1 of the Statutes of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George states that It is ordained tha)t if any Knight Grand Cross.... of this Most Distinguished Order be convicted of ...any grave misdemeanour derogatorv to his honour as a Knight and Gentleman.... he shall forthwith be degraded from tne said Most Distinguished Order.... and his name in the Register shall be eras ed....”. 6 13. It may be that conviction by a foreign court of an honorary Knight does not come w r ithin the scope of the Article in question but 1 feel it my duty to sub mit thes question for consideration. 14.

(50) (Received on 11th May 1930, with Political Secretary's letter No. 17, dated 24th April 1930.) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 107, dated the 7th March 1930. Among the recent decisions come to by the Persian Government was one to divide the present Ministry of Public Works into tw r o separate Ministries ; one of these w T ould be called the Ministry of Communications and would deal solely with questions of transport, roads, railways, &amp;c., the other would be called the Ministry of Economics and would deal with other matters relating to commerce and industry in the country, at present dealt with by the Ministry of Public Works. 2. I have been told privately that Taghi Zadeh, the present Minister in Lon don will be recalled in order to become the first Minister of Economics. The post was, I understand, offered to Vossuk-ed-Dowleh, and the Shah was very anxious that he should accept it, but Vossuk is not prepared at present to take office with an unconstitutional Minister of Court working behind the scenes. At the same time, Vossuk is still probably the most popular figure in public life, and there is a general wish that he should become Prime Minister. The Soviet Government would appear, however, to have lost none of their prejudice against Vossuk, and should he take office there would almost certainly be opposition from that quarter. 3. In the course of a long conversation I had with him when he dined at this Legation a few nights ago, I asked him if he could tell me what were the Shah’s intentions about the future of the railway. He said, in the first place, His Majes ty was absolutely opposed to a foreign loan, but he did not want the work on the railway stopped. His Majesty’s idea was that the work of levelling the track, building, tunnels, &amp;c., should continue, and that the cost of this should be paid for out 'of receipts of the sugar and tea monopoly. His Majesty realised that with the present price of silver Persia could not at present afford large expenditure abroad, but by working on the lines proposed it was possible that this could be avoided.58 4. I found, however, that Vossuk was no more enthusiastic about the pros pects of this railway than any other Persian with whom I have talked. He sees no economic future for the line, and said quite candidly that the real trouble was that there was no one with the courage to tell the Shah that the line could never pay, and that it would only be a financial burden to the country.

I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of despatches^ as marked below, which I have addressed to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs No. 199 of 10th May, 1930. Reinstatement in his former rank of Gene ral of Colonel Mohammad Khan Dar- gahi, the former Chief of Police. (Reference Tehran despatch No. 303 of December 15th, 1929). Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 199, dated the 10th May 1930. With reference to my despatch No. 606 of December 15th, 1929, I have the honour to report that at the end of April Colonel Mohammed Khan Dargahi, the former Chief of Police, was summoned to the presence of the Shah and re-instated in his former rank of General. It is stated that His Majesty was very gracious to him, patted him on the back and told him not to be downhearted as he was about to offer him an appointment commensurate with his rank. 2. The Shah showed him another immediate mark of favour by issuing orders- to the Municipality, which had just pulled down General Dargahi’s house for the purpose of street widening, that it was to rebuild the house on the new align ment a few yards further back in exactly the same manner as it formerly stood without any expense therefor falling on the General. 3. On May 6th, it was announced that General Dargahi had been appointed Director-in-Chief of the Conscription Bureau in place of General Khodayer Khan. This appointment is an important one, for the Director although nominallly sub ordinate to the Minister of War is in fact directly responsible to the Shah who exer cises a close supervision over the recruitment of the Persian Army. 4. General Dargahi’s short period of disgrace is therefore at an end and in appointing him to this post, His Majesty appears to have taken him back fully into favour. A copy of this despatch has been sent to the Government of India* (52) {Received on 18th May 1930, with Political Secretary's letter No. 18, dated the 1st May 1930).

The competent military authorities state that while this complaint is of a general nature, and unsubstantiated by any details, enquiries lave, in fact, shown that no British military aeroplanes have flown recently over the places mentioned or their vicinity ; it is possible, therefore, that the aeroplanes of the Imperial Airways mail service to India, which are authorised to follow tins route, may have been mistaken for military machines. 5. In this connexion I venture to point out that enquiries into alleged cases or trespassing by British aeroplanes over Persian territory would be greatly faci- itated if the competent Persian authorities could be instructed to furnish in all cases a description of the machine sighted. The British national marking of red, white and blue circles on the upper and lower planes clearly distinguishes military machines from those of the “ Imperial Airways 55 service, which have their identitv marks painted in Homan letters on the upper and lower planes. 6. The second complaint, made by the Governor of Pusht-i-Kuh was that three aeroplanes flew over the Persian frontier at about 10 a. m. on the 8th Azer- mah (November 29, 1929) and afterwards returned to Badrah. The competent military authorities report that on the 29th November three Royal Air Force machines flew from Baghdad to Badrah on duty and returned to Baghdad the evening of the same day. These machines did not cross the Persian frontier. They were probably flying high, and from the ground it may have appeared that they had crossed the frontier. 7. In conclusion, I venture to assure your Excellency that, while I obviously cannot promise that incidents such as these will never occur again, British mili tary aeroplanes have no wish whatever to trespass over Persian territory, and every possible effort has been made in the past, and will continue to be made in the future, to prevent such inadvertent trespassing. With this end in view I rely upon your Excellency to bring to my notice, in accordance with the universal practice, all adequately substantiated complaints as soon as possible after the occurrence of the incidents to which thev refer.

This morning I received a further note from hun, of which a copy is enclosed. 2. This note would appear to mean that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs will now resume its proper functions, and that the semi-official correspondence with the Minister of Court on every possible subject must now cease. Copy in translation of a note from Mirza Mohammad Ali Khan Feroughi, Minister for Foreign Affairs, addressed to His Majesta s Minister, Tehran, No. 1102/5000, dated the Ordi Behesht 22, 1309 (May 12th, 1930).

Letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 14/T of 1930, dated the 13th May 1930. With reference to my despatch No. 69/1000 of the 29th April 1930 (endorse ment of Serial No. 45) regarding an edict issued by the Shaikh .of Debai forbidding Persians from wearing Pahlavi hats in Dibai, I have the honour to state that 1 have discussed the matter to day with the Shaikh. He told me that his order did not apply to any Persians arriving in Dibai on temporary visits. There was how - ever a large colony of Persians settled in Dibai, most of whom had been resident there for periods varying from 20 to 60 years and were now definitely domiciled there, and their children born in Dibai were regarded by him as his own subjects, some of the younger generation of these Persians, born and domiciled in Dibai, had put on the costume to which exception had been taken and to them alone his order applied. 1 informed the Shaikh that I thought it was unwise of him to iasu e formal order and it would have been preferable to have dealt with a matter of this kind by friendly advice. He quite agreed and said that in future he would reter any matters which might offend foreign susceptibilities to the Residency Agen before taking action. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Government of India and to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India.m (55) JiNDORSEMENT BY THE FoRFTPivr aattv T^/-vx tv ' jIS ^ olitical Department, No. F. 21-N 1^0 DATED ^mla, the 2nd June 1930. ’ ’ The undermentioned papers are forwarded to (1) The Army Department (General Staff Branch). &lt;2) Th B2uc n £tan he t0 the G ° Ven0r General and Chief Commi SS ioner, (3) Hie Hon hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. &lt;4) ^^Khoraln 8 C ° nSul ' General and A § ent °£ the Government of India in (5) His Majesty's Consul-Cum oral.

I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of despatches, as marked below, which I have addressed to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs :— No. 220 of 20th May, 1930 .. Appointment of Feroughi as Minister for Foreign Affairs, and treaty negotiations. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 220, dated the 20th May 1930. In the course of a brief conversation which I had with the Minister of Court on the evening of May 15th, I asked His Highness what was exactly the significance of Feroughi’s appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs and of the circular letter which had been sent to myself and my colleagues to say that all communications must in future be addressed to the Ministry. 2. Teymourtache replied that it was on his advice that the Shah had made this appointment. I may add that it was done with the usual Persian lack of considera tion. Farzin merely received word when sitting in his office and without the •slightest previous warning that Feroughi had been appointed to succeed him and would take over the same afternoon. 3. His Highness went on to say that the doctors had ordered him to rest. They had told him to lead a more regular life. He was to do less work, to have his meals Rt regular hours, to rest after meals and not to go out in the evening. He intended62 however to maintain the general direction of Persian foreign policy. I asked what was the position in regard to our treaty negotiations. He said he would continue to deal with that himself. In that case I said I should be glad if he would fix a day for the continuance of our discussion. He said he would write to me and arrange a date. Five days have passed and he has not yet done so. 4. I have little doubt that in any European country a man in his state of health would have been ordered to take a rest cure for at least three months. He looks ill and worn. He is irritable and nervous. The prospect of a successful issue to our treaty negotiations within the next few months is not encouraging. I said so to Feroughi and asked him whether the Council of Ministers knew anything about these negotiations. He said he did not think so, certainly he knew nothing about them. If I hear nothing within the next day or two from Teymourtache, I shall raise the question again with Feroughi and ask him to ascertain whether the Shah still wishes to come to a settlement with His Majesty’s Government. A copy of this despatch has been sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Govern ment of India. (59) MEMORANDUM. The papers specified below were transmitted to the Secretary, Political Depart ment, India Office, London, for the information of His Majesty’s Secretary of,State for India, under cover of the Foreign Secretary’s letter No. 67-M., dated the 5th June 1930 :— Persia Series, Part XLII, Serial Nos.

Shah received “ Rosita Forbes ” this morning. Audience was arranged by Minister of Court without my intervention. She told me that His Majesty said that he hoped that within 5 years there would not be a single foreign official left in employment of Persian Government. He included Belgian Customs Officials and German employes of National Bank. His Majesty also spoke of Persian Gulf and ships ordered from Italy. He insisted on need of Persia taking her share in policing Gulf and stopping gun-running, slavery and smuggling. His Majesty had no objection to her publishing the above remarks. He also spoke of danger of communism and of service Persia was rendering Great Britain as buffer against spread of Bolshevik propaganda. These remarks were however not for publication.

Marc i h &lt;»« th « Qawam-ul AT 11 ’ u J x ^uvciimient m iviarcn lyyy, hereditary governorslup oyer Eastern Pars (Fasa, Darab, Lar, Sab’eh, and the ( n0rt ^. 0:f Lmgeh) and the Khamseh ’Arab tribef small (ml I orts north of Lingeh) and the .Khamseh ’Arab tribes was effected rinht at the end of the previous year (March 1929). Its consequences became apparent fw L ' , eglI1 ''uf 0 , f the yea f under review - The Q aw am himself, sumisino that bus people would object to the change and that he would be suspected of fomenting them, promptly asked for leave to quit Persia. He went to Berlin Paris and London etc., and is now understood to have settled down in Beyrout where Ids sons are completing their education. His foresight was justified : had he stayed in the country he would undoubtedly have shared with Saulat-ed-Daulah and un pleasant experience of incarceration in a Tehran dungeon. v a ' i U h, , le , the , ^ awam was on his way to Europe, Sartip Abul Hasan Khan Aandieh, who had been appomted Military Governor of Fasa. Darab, Lar and the Khamseh Arab tribes arrived at Shiran. Like the Qawam, he suspected that the people of his new Governorate would not be well disposed towards the new regime y uch he represented. He therefore asked Sartip Muhammad Khan Shahbakhti, Omcer Commanding the Ears Independent Brigade, to give him an escort of 300 soldiers. I his request Sartip Shahbakhti refused, and when the writer arrived at Shiraz in May the two Sartip were still at logger-heads. Meantime the Qawam’s men w ere not idle. r I he Khamseh Arab tribes, among whom the Baharlus were the outstanding element, in alliance with the people of Lar and Sarkuh and with the approbation of the settled population in Darab and Easa. rose against the Persian Government. They drove the Persian Government officials out of Darab at the end ef April and advanced on Fasa, which they took on May 9th. 4. Sartip Abul Hasan Khan left Shiraz with a small force on Mav 12th and proceeded to Fasa which he retook ; but shortly afterwards the rebels rallied, and he was surrounded and besieged in Fasa. Sartip Shahbakhti with a large'force went out from Shiraz to relieve him. Together they re-established order in Fasa for a time : but Darab and Lar remained in the hands of the rebels. When the troops returned to Shiraz, the Baharlus again advanced on Fasa, which they retook on dune 25th. Soon after they took Niriz and Istahbanat and began to approach Shiraz by two lines zva Sarvistan which they occupied on July 4th, and via Kharameh which they took a few days earlier ; but they got no further, for at this juncture Sartip Abul Hasan Khan was recalled and Yavar Muhammad Taqi Khan Arab appointed Governor of Fasa and Lar. He left Shiraz with 1,000 men on July 30th and advanced towards Fasa, sometimes negotiating and sometimes fighting. M ith the help of his influence over the Khamesh Arab tribes he was able to reach Fasa on August 12th. He was reinforced there by 700 men on August 21st. Early in September he advanced towards Darab, which he occupied after defeating a Baharlu force. The Baharlus then appealed to the rebels of the Sarkuh district for assistance, but the combined forces were caught between Yavar Muhammad Taqi Khan’s army and a body of reinforcements newly arriving from Shiraz and suffered a severe defeat. Sheikh Hassan Sarkuhi fled, but most of his followers surrendered. The Baharlus also tendered their submission. Later, in the winter, troops were sent to Lar itself and re-established Government authority there ; schools are being opened, taxes collected, and the rebels of yesterday are adopting Pahlevi hats and new style clothes. MC285FD64 5. The Government might have dealt with the rebellion in eastern Fars more promptly if they had not been engaged elsewhere. Unfortunately for them the Qashqai tribes, alarmed by reports that Sultan Abbas Khan, the oppressive military Governor who had fleeced them with a very heavy hand, had been reappointed, and that the Government intended to number and tax their sheep, deprive them of their rifles, and make them settle down in villages in northern Fars, broke out in revolt under the leadership of ’Ali Khan, the Saulat-ed-Dowleh's half brother. The Saulat himself who was in Tehran, was promptly put into gaol by the Persian Government, who kept him in a damp cell too low to allow a person to stand upright in it. Nasir Khan, the Saulat’s eldest son, w T as also kept in Tehran, but Malik Mansur Khan, the second son, a scholar at the American College at Tehran, hastened to join the tribes and won the hearts of all by his gallantry and daring. 6. The imminence of a Qashqai outbreak caught the Persian Government offi cials in Fars unprepared and with divided counsels. The Governor-General Prince Akbar Mirza Mas’ud, Sarirfr-ed-Dowleh, believed that the military forces in tl e province w*ere insufficient to overawe the tribes, that no fresh forces could be obtain ed from Tehran, and that it was therefore imperative to temporise. He had a con ference with Ali Khan, the Qashqai leader, early in May, and received the tribes men's demands, which included the release of the Saulat, recognition of Saulat or one of his son as Ilkhani, no disarmament and no conscription. These were quite un acceptable to the Government, which accepted Sartip Shahbakhti’s view 7 that the Qashqais must be^oerced without accepting the obvious implication that sufficient force must be provided to coerce them. The tribes migrating north, reached the im mediate vicinity of Shiraz before anything had been done to appease or oppose them. In the early morning of June 4th the Qashqais closed the Bushire road and cut the telegraph wires. Two days later they blocked the road to Isfahan and cut the tele graph lines there also. Shiraz was isolated. 7. The isolation of Shiraz at last woke up the Central Government to the reali sation that something serious w r as happening. The Amir Lashkar Habibullah Khan Shaibani v T as sent down from Tehran to take supreme charge of affairs in the province, both Military and civil. He was met at Pul-i-Khan, 28 miles out of Shiraz, by a large escort and twn armoured cars, but even so had difficulty in fighting his w^ay into Shiraz against the opposition of the Qashqais, w T ho w r ere holding the hills on both sides of the road. He was lucky to receive fresh reinforcements from Shiraz w’ho opened the road momentarily and brought him in on the night of June 6th losing over fifty men in the operation. The same night the Qashqais made a night attack on the aerodrome, which w 7 as guarded by a strong military detachment, and disabled two military aeroplanes On June 9th, 10th and 11th there w^as heavy fighting at Chinar Rahdar, only four miles west of Shiraz, which the Qashqais took only to be driven out again by a counter-attack. The military followed up this success by advancing towards Deh Sheikh, but lost so many men that they were glad to retreat to Chinar Rahdar again. The Amir Lashkar’s first action when this lull in the fight gave him a momentary respite was to get the Governor-General recalled to Tehran, together with Sartip Fazlullah Khan Zahidi, the Officer Commanding Road-Guards throughout Persia, and Sartip Muhammad Hussain Mirza, son of Farman Farma, thereby reducing from 5 to 3 the number of General in Shiraz. Sarim-ed-Dowleh and the two Generals w r ere accused of wilfully concealing from the Shah the serious situation in Fars, and of being concerned with Prince Firuz, the Minister of Finance, in a Qajar plot to over-throw Reza Shah with the help of the tribes. They were also accused of being too friendly with certain foreign elements i.e., the British. Sarim-ed-Dowleh had in fact been very friendly with Mr. Chick, His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz, and had asked his opinion on the tribal situation ; but the suggestion that he w^as working with the British against the Pahlevi regime was of course absurd, as wras the suggestion made in Tehran that the British w 7 ere supporting the tribes by supplying (or allowing them to be supplied) with arms and ammunition. The popular rumour that Mr. Chick, instead of going on leave, had remained in Persia and, dressed as a dervish, was directing the movements of the tribes, w r as still more lacking in verisimilitude ; while the writer’s request that guards should be provided for the houses of British residents in exposed situations outside the town was misconstrued as an alarmist attitude designed to inspire lack of confidence in the Persian Government’s power to deal with the situation.Out of sucK scanty materials a supposed Qajar plot with British support was in vented ; and on the charge of being implicated in it Sarim-ed-D©Wleh was placed under operi arrest, Sartip Muhammad Hussain Mirza Firuzi was disgraced, and Sartip b azlullah Khan Zahidi was deprived of his rank and employment. ^ 9. Meanwhile, after the Amir Lashkar had fought his way into Shiraz, the Government troops were left barely holding the crest of the hills just north of the town. Military and Boad-Guards posts on the Isfahan road were left to their own devices. The Amnieh post at Ab-i-bank near Zarqan was overcome and disarmed by the Qashqais.' The post of 50 soldiers at Puhi-Khan, 28 miles out of Shiraz, v as attacked by night, and Malik Mansur Khan with a band of Darashuns rtished the post killed the garrison to a man,, and damaged the important bridge so that motor vehicles could not cross it. 10. - The approach of Muharrem brought a lull in the struggle, both sides having agreed to a truce for the period of the mourning observances. After the truce, the military authorities succeeded in reopening the Isfahan road about the end of June ; and to introduce disunion among the Qashqais an amnesty was proclaimed to all who would cease resistance. Ve'Ty few Khans accepted the offer, but under cover of the amnesty some envoys came in to negotiate. The Persian Government unable to overcome the Qashqais by force of arms decided to make some concessions. They released the Satilat-ed-Dowleh from his dungeon in Tehran and sent him to Shiraz by aeroplane on July 10th. He went out to Ardakatl two days later to interview the Khans. The same day a force of 1200 men left accompanied by 300 Boad-Guards to hold the posts on the road to reopen the Bushire road and 200 workmen to repair the bridges etc. wrecked by the rebels. This party was not opposed. The road was open all the way from Shiraz to Bushire by the end of J ulyV 11. There is no doubt that the Persian Governments’ decision to make terms with the Qashqais Was hastened by the Bakhtiari rising which broke out in the middle of July and which found the Isfahan province- almost denuded of troops, Sartip Shahbakhti left Shiraz with a large body of reinforcements on July 17th to take part in the Bakhtiari campaign. He did not return to Shiraz. Early in 1930 he was replaced as Officer Gommanding the Ears Independent Brigade by Sartip ’ All Shah Khan, formerly Officer Commanding troops in Kerman. The Sartip has little power, however, while the Amir Lashkar Shaibani remains in the province^ with full powers, military and civil, over all the souths 12. After the recall and disgrace of His Highness Prince Akbar Mirza Mas’ud (Sarim-ed-Dowleh) no new Governor General of Ears was appointed. For a time Ghulam Ali Khan Arbabi, Director of Posts and Telegraphs, was Acting Governor- General. He' was recalled to Tehran on July 9th.. Mahmud Khan Ghaffari was them sent down from Tehran as Assistant Governor General, while the Amir Lashkar exercised all the powers and functions of the Governor General (drawing the salary included). Neither Habibullah Khan Shaibani nor Mahmud Khan Ghaffari had any direct relations with the Acting Consul or members of the British community during 1929 or the first two months of 1930. They ddubtless kept m mind the troubles which had befallen Sarim-ed-Dov leh on account of his alleged friendliness with the English. 13. With the refease of Saulat-ed-Dowleh, a policy' of “ laissez faire ” was inaugurated as between the Government and the Qashqais. No peace was made, no settlement was negotiated. The fighting gradually stopped as the more bellicose Khans came under the Saulat’s influence or realised that there was nothing to be gained by continuing. Also the Qashqais had exhausted their reser\ es ot ammunition. The Saulat, though not appointed Ilkhani, exercised all the powers of the Ilkhani. He organised the southward migration, which passed off with no more than minor breaches of the peace. He also arranged for the collection of the Qashqais taxes, and a Persian Finance Official accompanied the tribes to their winter quarters and collected the revenue under the Saulat’s eye, thus avoiding the exactions and extortions which had antagonised the Qashqais under the military governorship of Sultan Abbas Khan. At the end of the year under reyiew^.e., m March 1930, the Qashqais were quiet and peaceful everywhere ; nor do they have anv idea of-fighting this summer unless the Persian Government attempts to carry out its declared intention of disarming them. They lost so many young children66 and so much live stock last year, especially those section which had to stay in the “garmsir ” (hot country) all through the summer, that they want time to re cuperate before beginning the struggle again. Also they are still short t)f ammuni. tion. . 14. The Khamseh and Qashqai troubles being settled, Ears was at peace once more except for the depredation of the Boir Ahmedi tribe, which plundered un checked as far afield as the Baisa district north-west of Shiraz and the Semiran district west of Qumisheh. They even crossed the Shiraz-Isfahan road near A^adeh and robbed villages in the west of the Yezd district. Their merciless barbarity horrified even their erstwhile allies the Qashqais. The Government had not been able to punish them at the end of the year. 15. In southern Ears also there was fighting, after the main trouble had ended, in the region of Borazjun and Ahmadi, but this was faction fighting between various local elements rather than revolt against the Government. Ghazanfar-es- ■&gt; Saltaneh, Zabit of Brazjun, one of the chief disturbers of the peace, was reported killed on the 27th February, since which date the district has been more peaceful. The Army has been disarming the Tangistanis and Dashtistanis in the opening months of 1930. 16. Naturally, with political conditions so disturbed, security was conspicuous by its absence on most of the roads in Ears. Car and caravan robberies were far too numerous to recount in detail here ; but the attack on a car carrying members of the Church Missionary Society on the Bushire road in April deserves special mention; Mr. Proctor, driver of the car, and Miss Henriques, a lady doctor, were wounded by the brigands. The Bushire road was very unsafe in April and May, closed completely for June and most of July, opened intermittently in August, September and October on payment of rahdari, and often closed from November to March by rain, snow or floods, the winter being a particularly cold and wet one for Ears. The road to Isfahan was kept open better after the troubles, but was closed to car traffic in January and February through severe weather. The road via Niriz to Kerman and Bandar Abbas was seldom open at all owing to robberies. The trade of Shiraz suffered very seriously from these adverse conditions. 17. The Indo-European Telegraph Department also had a difficult year. On May 13th one wire was interrupted 22 miles west of Shiraz by Darashuri tribesmen, and many insulators were broken. On May 20th one line was interrupt- e . 10 miles west of Shiraz. On the 24th second line was interrupted. n .

All hues to Isfahan were cut early in the morning of June 6th; one was restored on June 8th, the other two later. Between Dasht-i- Arzan and kazerun, wilful damage occurred on a large scale ; many miles of wire were removed wholesale, poles uprooted, insulators broken, stalks removed etc. Ghulams out on duty were repeatedly robbed, but bravely went out time after time to repair the fines while the authorities refused to give them an escort of vltlTL ° T T d '^ rds - . 0n June 25th a11 lines were interrupted south of Konar iakhteh, and«on the 26th again cut north of Konar Takhteh.

There was one point in the Persian nronn&lt;?pk butwht kneW 't W /, W be Very dlfficult for the SOTiet Governmen^to^agreerto but which was of vital importance to the Persian. While the Persian Govern ment could not object to the Soviet system of trading only through Government agencies, however much they might dislike it, they were not going 8 to allow these trade agencies m Persia to deal direct with the consumer, eliminating the Persian merchant altogether. Apart from purely commercial considerations this would tbisnnS 7 °Fwi nS the 1 do “ r to communist propaganda. He had discussed tnis question with the merchants and they were prepared for the Government to so to any extreme rather than agree to this. What w-ere the Russian products which ersia especially required ? They were sugar, mineral oil and cotton goods. Sugar could be obtained elsewhere from Belgium, France, or the Dutch Indies, although it would cost them about a penny, a pound more. The Anglo-Persian Gil Companv could increase their sales organisation in Persia and could supply all the oil that was required. England, Italy and other countries could furnish all the require ments m cotton goods. H +u Russian imports were not therefore vital to Persia, although he did not deny hat lf Russia closed her frontiers to Persian goods the northern provinces would Sutter. He hoped much from the opening of the Rowandez road with ’ Iraq and tor the first time admitted that the Duzdap Railway would be likely to become an YaIuab,e tTade alter y to India - He argued, however, that Hu&amp;iam definitely needed Persian cotton and to a lesser extent nee* indes and wool. He* admitted that she could dispense with Persian dried fruits altogether and new markets would, have to be found for fruit* 3. But the present system could not. continue, Russia was getting all sh^ wanted from Persia and sending in return increasing quantities of goods of third rate importance such as porcelain, ironware, etcetera, which Persia could easily do without. 4. The Government had accordingly decided to introduce legislation whereby Persia would in future only import from countries with which she had no commer cial treaty goods to a value not greater than the value of tfie goods she exported to that country. He adcfi?d that this conld in no case affect Great Britain as all the v Persian oil went th^re. I asked if the Government had weighed the consequences of such a policy. ' He said they had and that His Mapesty was entirely in favour of it. If drastic action was not taken now they would be forced to take it in a year’s time when the* position would be worse. His Majesty desired peace and good relations with every country, but not at the expense of. Persia’s dignity and honour. 5. I cannot Kelp feeling that Persia is pursuing a rash and dangerous policy both in the sphere of trade and economics. No one can foretell^least of all the Minister of Court himself—whither Persia is being led by her Exchange Control Law, her Gold Standard Law, two useless ends of a railway which has already cost her some four million pounds sterling, and the prospect of a trade war with her most powerful neighbour and best, customer, Soviet Russia. 6.

I have the Honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of a Municipal Law which was passed by the Majlis on May 20th. 2. This Law reduces to 800,000 Tomans (500,000 for Tehran and 300,000 for the provinces) the portion of the road tax receipts which is handed over to the municipalities in accordance with the Road Tax Law of February 1928. As 1,800,000 Tomans were paid to the municipalities in 1928-29, the last year for which figures have been published, it is obviously intended .that the road budget should benefit to the extent of one million tomans. This, however, must clearly depend on the road tax receipts. 3. I understand that the Shah is largely responsible for this measure, Majesty being greatly interested in the construction of strategic roads in Wes Persia as well as the coastal road from Bushire to Bandar Abbas on which the Road?

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. Overseas Trade (B) 39, dated the 17th April 1930. I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a 1 letter which has come into my possession from the agents of the Soviet Mercantile Fleet in Basrah,70 Messrs. Yenilal Bros, to the Soviet transport agency Bureau Perse in Tehran enclosing a copy of a letter addressed by the former to the Sharq Company iir Mohammerah. The latter are obviously acting as agents for the Soviet Mercantile Fleet in Persia's southern ports. 2. Reference is made to the fact that Russian steamers are now sailing into the Persian Gulf every ten days, which means that Russian competition against British goods is growing more dangerous than ever. It remains to be seen whether this will continue now that the Russians find that they cannot buy sterling drafts on London as they have been doing so heavily in past years. What interests them, of course, is not so much the volume of their sales in Persia as the excess of their sales over their purchases, and their ability to turn that excess into foreign currency. They may however be content to accumulate krans until the present restrictions on the sale and purchase of foreign exchange are over, in spite of the risks involved. (I might mention that whereas the Russian Bank up to some years ago was went to buy drafts on a variety of foreign centres such as New York, London, Paris, Stockholm, etcetera, they now invariably buy sterling drafts on London, where they would therefore appear to have formed a central pool). 3. What Messrs. Venilal are entirely concerned with in the enclosed letter is- the difficulty of finding outward freights for the greatly increased number of Rus sian steamers which are now visiting the Gulf. 4.

Hear Sirs, For your information we enclose herewith copy of our letter of yesterday’s date addressed to your Mohammerah House under the above heading and we trust that you will find same interesting. We shall be glad if you will let us have your comments on the subject as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, For VENILAL BROTHERS. Signature. VENILAL BROS. Messrs. Chark Coy., MOHAMMERAH. Dear Sirs, General Marchants and Commission Agents, No 43, New Garden Street, ASHAR. Post Box No. 28. Basrah, 8th April 1930. Subject.— Outward Freights. Formerly we had a steamer, say, once in three months. Of late, however, the intei\al between one vessel and another has been considerably shortened. Me have now a steamer available more or less every ten days. It has been our practice to accept cargo only for Red Sea Ports hitherto. We managed, somehow or other, to load or partly fill our steamers so far. At present, unfortunately, the grain posi- tiori is so bad that it is becoming more and more difficult to obtain cargo for only Leo Sea Ports. Added to this difficulty, as has already been advised, we have more71 'A steamers than formerly. At the moment, therefore, the subject that should engage Reamer UH flT 1S + , the qUeStion ° f outward heights. It is realised that if a nr r ,L deSP ^ ChedW f h0Ut 0r Wlth 0nly part car g°’ tlle Soviet Mercantile Fleet • r , . ' , en we iaie ’ rno;re or ^ es s, weekly steamers or foitnightly sailings, if we continue to be unable to give full loads the magnitude of the loss increases to a consic enable extent. If this state of things continues, the endeavour of the Soviet Mercantile Fleet to maintain a regular service to and from the Persian Gulf, far from being a paying proposition, will result in total loss. Steps must, therefore be taken imme lately to ensure that steamers obtain, as far as possible, sufficient loads, at least to pay their way. Besides the Soviet Mercantile Fleet, there are the British India Steam Naviga- kme . S ^Hermann and Bucknall Steamship Coy. Ltd., and the hi ansa Line are maintaining regular services to and from the Persian Gulf. Ihe question, therefore, naturally arises as to how these companies manage to make a profitable proposition of their service. The answer is simple. They accept cargo not only to Bed Sea Ports but also to the Mediterranean, continental and English Ports. Leaving the dates and grain seasons out of the question, the only other cargo available for export falls under the following main heads :— I Wool. II Skins. /Ill Carpets. IV Gum, Intestines, etc. (I) Wool .—The chief markets for this commodity are Marseilles, Hamburg! London and New York. Then there is Genova, Trieste and other Mediterranean Ports also consuming a fair quantity. The markets for Skins, Carpets, Gum etc., are also identically the same, but as wool forms by far the greatest quantity we are writing to you under this heading. The rate of freight on wool to Mediterranean, continental, English and/or American Ports compares very favourably with our rates to Red Sea Ports. Effort, must, therefore, be made to secure this cargo to fill up our steamers and thus avoid incurring a loss on the outward voyages. We are given to understand that the Soviet Mercantile Fleet possess representa tives and/or capable Agents all over Europe and America. We find that a regular Service is maintained between those ports. Port Said forms a connecting link bet ween the Persian Gulf and the rest and if arrangements could be made to tranship cargo at this port for Marseilles, London, New York, etc., with the facility of issuing through Bills of Lading at Basrah there is no doubt that a quantity of paying freight can be obtained for each and every one of our steamers. Kindly look into this matter and advise us early whether transhipment facilities already exist at Port Said and if so what are the expenses incurred in transhipment. We require the latter information to enable us to adjust the rates of freights to be charged. If transhipment facilities do not exist at Port Said, may we ask whether arrangements may be concluded with the present Agents of the Soviet Mercantile Fleet for tran shipment of through outvrard cargo. Were this system to come into force it must also be borne in mind that a considerable quantity of inward cargo at very paying rates of freight may be booked from America, English, Continental and Mediterra nean Ports to Persian Gulf. Kindly give this matter your special attention and let us have your reply in detail. Dates and Grain. —If we are given permission to load steamers for London and/or continental ports, according to inducement, we will be able to obtain full loads of grain and/or dates on, say, paying freight. The other steamship companies mentioned in this letter are relying to a great extent on the carriage of Dates and Grain to continental Ports and if we get this privilege no doubt another avenue of steady income for the Soveit Mercantile Fleet will be opened. Y our remarks on this subject wdll be welcome. Yours faithfully, For VENILAL BROTHERS. MC2S5FD y\(65) (Received cn 22nd June 1930, uith Political Secretary's letter No. 23, dated 5:h June 1930.) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 187, dated the 3rd May 1930. With reference to my despatch No. 40 of January 25th last [Serial No. (24)], I have the honour to report that on various occasions during the last three months I have discussed with the Minister of Court the question of the Sheikh's health and the necessity for him to go to Europe for medical treatment as well as the general question of the settlement of his affairs. 2. The Sheikh has been very ill and the rumours of his dangerous state of health have gone beyond the borders of Persia ; the Baghdad Times of January 31st published a stop-press news to the effect that it had received confirmation of his death and on February 15th I received a telegraphic enquiry from His Majesty’s High Commissioner in Iraq as to the truth or otherwise of the rumour. 3 On March 15th I reminded Teymourtache in conversation of my letter to him of January 24th (enclosure to my despatch No. 40) [Enclosure to Serial No. (24)], which had remained without reply and enquired whether there was a possibi lity 0 f the Sheikh being allowed to go 'to Europe. Teymourtache repl'ed that he did not think that the Shah would allow it. I then enquired whether His Majesty also did not wish his affairs to be settled. He replied that on the contrary, the Shah would like to see a settlement of these affairs. I said that in that case I was at a loss to understand how some five years had been allowed to lapse without any arrangement hav ng been made. Teymourtache said he would talk to the Minister of Finance about it. 4. I learnt subsequently that he had mentioned the matter to the Minister of Finance (Mushar-ul-Mulk), who I knew was sympathetic to the Sheikh, and the latter did actually bring up the question in the Council of Ministers, but it was shelved as there was some important affair to be discussed. 5. Towards the second half of March the Sheikhs' health gave great cause lor anxiety and on March 24th there took place a consultation of seven European and Persian Doctors at which a certificate in writing was drawn up that the only hope of recovery was for the Sheikh to go to Europe and receive proper treatment. I informed Teymourtache of this diagnosis on April 1st and obtained and sent him a copy of the report on the following day. Teymourtache informed me verbally then that if the Sheikh would consent to take with him a Doctor appointed by the Persian Government, he thought that permission for him to go might be accorded. The Sheikh very willingly accepted the proposal and it looked as though at last ho might be able to get away. Later, however, the Shah’s doctor, Doctor Amir Aalam was sent to see the Sheikh and after a second visit he reported that the Sheikh s illnesses could be just as well cured in Tehran as in Europe. In view of this report it was no longer considered necessary for the Sheikh to go. Teymourtache added that the Government were afraid lest the Sheikh might become a centre of intrigue in Europe and that if he were allowed to go he might never return, ending up by saying that if he were the Sheikh he would certainly never return. I said it might be possible to obtain certain guarantees and that he might be furnished with a tem porary passport valid for some fixed period, but Teymourtache said he could not see what really valid guarantees the Sheikh could give. 6. In spite of all my efforts I have been quite unable to make one step forward either in the matter of treatment abroad for his health or in the question of the general settlement of his affairs. I am confronted each time by the same bad faith on the part of Teymourtache as my predecessor was from the present Shah. Teymourtache continually professes that His Majesty wants a settlement of the Sheikh’s affairs but he seems to do nothing to implement the various promises given to both my predecessor and to me, in fact I can only conclude that the Shah will neither let the Sheikh go to Europe nor will he give orders for his claims to be settled. On the last occasion when I discussed the affairs of the Sheikh with Teymourtache and charged both him and the Government with deliberate bad faith, he replied by saying that the Sheikh as former rebel was very lucky to have been let off with his life.73 broken for^the^asrfivf years'^ br ° ken promises &gt; P romi ses made and deliberately be prepared to authorise me torive a nersn matter an y further unless you would effect that this instance of Persian bad faith 3 m f S3a '' e ^ tlle Minister of Court to the have really nothing to lose-has made l ' ln fact the Pe rtian Government this late hour you hope that the Peroi ^ U lm P resslon on y°u and that even at to the Sheikh. 7 P h6 PeiSlan Go ^nment will still see fit to do justice (66) (Received on 22nd June 1930, vitk Political Secretary’s Weekly letter No. 23, dated the oth June 1930.)

The high decoration held by the Prince was, in tact, awarded to him, not for his own qualifications, but as Persian Minister for foreign Affairs when accompanying the late ez-Shah on an official visit to this country. Similarly, it is not usual to regard the Statutes of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George as applying to honorary members of foreign nationality. In these circumstances it would perhaps be invidious to single out the one individual foreign member for degradation, while if it were to become the practice to degrade undesirable foreign members, the danger would arise that some of these might subsequently rise once more to power and acquire important posts in the service of their Government. 3. For these reasons I do not propose to take any action in the matter. (68) Memorandum from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 89, dated the 10th June 1930.

Hart, the United States Minister in Persia, were attacked by Lurs some fifty miles North of Dizful on the Kurramabad Hoad. One lorry managed to escape but the other two were looted by the raiders.” 2 Mr Hart told me about this at the time and said that at a very low estimate he valued the stolen property, which included some thirty coloured mezzotints and rare embroideries in addition to the usual silver and household effects at seven thousand dollars. He asked me whether I thought the Persians would pay any compensation and in what form it would be best to notify the Persian Govern ment of the loss. I said that I hardly thought that the Persian Government would admit liability, but it was conceivable that to avoid the scandal of it being known that the United States Minister’s effects had been taken by bandits on the new road, which had an Amineh (Gendarmerie) post every half mile, they might offer compensation ex-gratia. I suggested that therefore it might ^6 best the i instance merely to notify the Persian Government of the facts, especiall) as it Mas still possible that some of the goods might be recovered. 3 This Mr. Hart did but for some three weeks did not even receive an ac knowledgment of his note, much less an expression of regret. At the same time he informed the State Department of the circumstances. 4 This morning Mr. Hart called on me to s^y that he had received a cable from Washington instructing him officially to demand compensation for the loss o i Ti “ iTnit-prl States Minister for which the Persian Government inCU ,7K /id resoonsTble and te ling Mm to keep the State Department informed would be held responsible and temng n F h instluctkmB h. would too™ .tot to but to demand oom P .o- sation for himself was much more difficu t. - He had the impression that the State Department had come to the end of resort to withdraw the 16^1.^^^ Mr their ^ onsu i ; the discourtesy of unpleasant incident , viHl imh the American Financial Mission, and ingratitude towards rioct or Mdlspaughand theAme^ ^ towards and now the cancelling o } Persian high road.

With reference to my despatch No. 188 of May 4th [enclosure of Serial No. (48)] regarding the sentence passed on Firuz Mirza, the late Minister of Finance, I have the honour to report that His Majesty the Shah has exercised the royal clemency in favour of the condemned Minister and allowed him to serve the rest of his term of imprisonment in his own house instead of in the State prison. 2. It appears that Mirza Hassan Khan Mustofi made an appeal to the Shah on the occasion of the commemoration of the martyrdom of the Imam Husein known as Ashura which fell on the 8th, 9th and 10th of this month in favour of Prince Firuz who was said to be ill in prison, requesting that His Majesty would consent to use the royal prerogative and reduce the sentence imposed on the Prince. The Shah consulted the Minister of Justice who informed His Majesty that the royal right of pardon could be used to reduce up to one-quarter of the sentence imposed. His Majesty however, decided not to reduce the term but rather to diminish the rigour of the sentence and Firuz Mirza was allowed to go to his house on the 12th instant and stay there for the rest of his term of imprisonment. 3. It will be remembered that the sentence passed on Firuz Mirza included the loss of civil rights. The paragraph of the law governing the punishment of Govern ment officials does not, however, mention the period during which the condemned party will lose such rights and it was understood generally that it was perpetual. There would appear now to be some doubt about this as the ordinary Persian law dealing with the loss of civil rights makes the period one of five years as a concomi tant of four months’ imprisonment which was the term imposed on the Prince. The same law, however, in another article provides that where the proceedings were of a criminal nature, the loss of civil rights is for a minimum period of ten years. The period of such loss would therefore appear to be governed by the gra vity of the ofience. In the absence of any official pronouncement it is of course impossible to say whether Firuz Mirza will be in time re-acquire his civil rights or not, but as nobody in Persia to-day really condemns the act for which the Prince was sentenced, it is not impossible that after the lapse of a couple of years, ways and means of rehabilitating him will be discovered.

Reference : To the Foreign Office, London, No. 121 of 19th March, 1930. Despatch from II. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 121, dated the 19th March 1930. In the course of an interview with the Minister of Court on March Ibth His Highness told me that it had been decided to place Prince Finw on his trial for malversation of public funds during the time when he was Minister of Finance, as the Persian Government were now in possession of incontrovertible proof of this. It had been a great shock to him as Firuz was one of his eldest friends, in fact he alone had been responsible for inducing His Majesty, who never liked Firuz, to include him in the Government. He knew, however, that the Prnice was one of the ablest men in Persia and that if only he could be induced to play straight he could render real assistance to the country. He had sent for Firuz before his appointment as Minister of Finance and the Prince? had sworn on his oath to be loyal to the Shah and to be honest in his administra tion of the country’s finances. 2. I asked His Highness if he had never had reason to suspect Prince Firuz’ honesty until now. 1 had been given to understand that the Prince had debts to the amount of about 1,00,000 Tomans at the date of his appointment whereas about 18 months later 1 was told that he had paid off most of his debts and was in affluent circumstances. His Highness made no comment. 3. The subject then passed to the question of the reconstruction of the Cabinet. 1 had asked His Highness what offices exactly it was intended that Ferroughi and Taghi Zahdi should occupy on their return to Tehran. His Highness proceeded to tell me in confidence that the Shah very much wished him to become President of the Council and to form a cabinet of competent ministers. He had no wish himself to become Prime Minister as in that case he would have to spend a good deal of his time defending the Government’s policy in the Majlis. At the s’ame time he realised that the present Cabinet was hopeless and must be strengthened. He had suggested, therefore, to Kis Majesty tiiat Ala, the present Minister in Paris, should he recalled to take over the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that Ferroughi should become the first Minister of Economies and Taghi Zahdi Minister of Communications. He said that Kerim Agha, the present Minister of Public Works, was quite unsuited to be a Minister at all and that His Majesty now realised this. Kerim Agha was a good soldier and had done good work as Head of the Tehran Muni cipality but he was a man of limited capacity and no education. His High ness went on to say that nothing had yet been definitely settled and that it might be that Mukhbar es Sultaneb would be allowed to remain a little longer as Prime Minister. Ala had not yet been recalled and it was uncertain whether he would be. I concluded from this that there was so intention of sending Ala as Minister to London. 4. Mhen I saw His Highness again yesterday he began by referring to the forthcoming trial ot Prince Firuz. A bill providing for this which W new before the Majlis was published in yesterday’s papers. He enquired, With reference to our previous conversation, whether I had definite grounds for ft statement 1 had then made about Prince Firuz’ finances. 1 replied tiiat my interest in [he Prince s finances was not due to mere curiosity. I had a mere definite imerest than that. At regular intervals T received from the War Office in London a reouest to press for payment by the Prince of an account for a doth £5,000 which he. owed them. I knew that it was hopeless to press tor payment if cue Prince was practically insolvent as he was at the time when he became Minister of Finance. I had waited therefore until, as a resuli of , i -r, ... ■- - - fat ’a .'021137 the Court, the Imperial Bank or the Ottoman Bank would he bound to make a statement of the Prince's balance. I said I did not know. Although I presume that both of these Banks would be bound to do this I did not feel that His Highness should be encouraged in a course which might conceivably in the future lead to great abuses. 5. As we were speaking of Prince Firuz I said I should like to ask His Highness a question ; no one had ever clearly understood why the Prince had been arrested last June. I had given for what it was worth my own personal opinion on the subject in a despatch to my Government (see paragraphs 11 and 12 of my despatch No. Hi Confidential of January 9th) [Enclosure of Serial Mo. (7)]. I had gained the Impression that the Shah had had Prince Firuz and Akbar Mirza simultaneous arrested at the time of the troubles in Fars s an insurance against the possibility of a Kajar rising against the present regime, and that it was not for anything that he had done as Minister of Finance that The Prince had originally been confined to his house under police supervision. His Highness said that this was quite true. His Majesty was well aware that the Pahlevi dynasty was not popular in South Persia and that it was commonly said tbore that had been more freedom and less taxation under tlie Kejars. Akbar Mirza, the Governor, had proved himself quite incapable of dealing with the situation at Shiraz and His Majesty had come—quite un reasonably—to suspect him. About the same time His Majesty learnt that a meeting had taken place between the elder Bakhtiari Khans at which Mustofi, an ex-Prime Minister, had been present, when the question had been discussed as k&gt; what would happen in the event of His Majesty disappearing from the scene. At that meeting it had been agreed that Persia must inevitably become a republic aiuf tin-r Mustofi was me obvious man to he President. For all these reasons His Majesty had decided, without consulting anybody and without telling anybody, to have these two Kajars princes arrested. 6. I then said to His Highness that I had myself often thought about wiiat would happen in Persia in case anything happened to His Majesty. Mo one so far as I knew believed that the little Valiahd could at present hope 1o suc ceed, and the general '(‘pinion appeared to be that Persia must inevitably be come a republic. This appeared o me to be a form of government entirely unsuited to the country in its nresent state of development. I imagined that it would give rise to endless friction, and that the only people who w-ould genuinely welcome a republic in Persia would be the Soviet Government. Tey- mourtache said that this was exactly his own view, and it wus for this reason that His Majesty’s life was so very precious ; it wns essential to the country, he added, that His Majesty, who was now 53, should live at least another T5 years, by wdiich time the Valiahd, who was a very intelligent boy, would have finished his education and become known in the country so that, if the general state of affairs was then satisfactory, he might hope peacefully to succeed his father. His Highness vnnt on to say that there w T ere two elements in the country who bitterly opposed the present regime : these were the clericals and wdiat he might call the old aristocracy, by wdiich he meant the old governing classes, the tribal chiefs and the landed proprietors. 'The Shah’s policy was to bring young men to the fore not mily in civil life but more especially in the army so that in a few years time the men in high positions would be those who had been brought up under the present regime and had had no direct ecnnec- tlon with the regime which existed before the coup d’etat of 1921. I said to HF Highness that I hsH a ve»-v great r^ocet for His MH^sty and could not but admire the great wmrk he had done for his country, but if I might be allow ed to say so, His Majesty appeared to me to have one very serious shortcoming and that was his avarice nod lack of generosity. Most great rulers of the past who had enjoyed the sort of autocratic power which the Shah possessed had been able to maintain a measure ^f popularity because on occasions they w&gt;ere capable of great acts of generosity.. It seemed to me that this trait v~as en tirely lacking in His Majesty’s character and was perhaps the chief cause of his lack of popularity in the’conn try. His Highness agreed, but said that His Majesty had in his opinion a still greater fault and that was his suspicion of everybody and everything. There w^as really nobody in the whole country whom His Majesty trusted and this was very much resented by those who had always stood 'faithfully by him. It kept His Majesty in a position remote from his most faithful adherents who all felt that at any moment His Majesty 'might turn against them. He supposed that he himself wms the person who knew His Majesty most ini mm Toly and understood his character best and he hud sometimes spoken to His Majesty about his suspicious nature, but lie wasafraid that His Majesty vas too old now to change that side of his character. As regards the characteristic to which I had alluded, that was not in his opi nion wholly had for the country. His Majesty hated spending his own money wasted. There was consequently much less waste of public funds nowadays than in the past as His Majesty himself kept a close supervision over all spend ing of public money. 7. I should add that I had previously explained to Teymourtache that it was only because we knew each other so well and always spoke quite frankly te each other that I had ventured in strict confidence to advance these criticisms of His Majesty. Teymourtache said that he perfectly understood this and it was for the same reason that he had spoken equally frankly. He fully realised that His Majesty’s Government’s attitude towards the Pahlevi dynasty was quite different to that of :he Soviet Government. He knew' that it was to our interest to see a strong and uniled Persia whereas he equally knew that the Soviet would like to see a chaotic and disunited Persia. S. We then passed to a discussion of the General Treaty. Copies of this despatch have been sent to the Foreign Secretary tq the Government of India and His Majesty's High Commissioner for ’Iraq.

I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a despatch from His Majestv’s Vice-Consul at Re slit describing the short-levied activities of “ The Last ^Development Company ” in Gilan. 2. This company, under the directorship of a Hungarian Jew named Kovacs, who w r as described as “ a Hungarian nobleman of high rank,” started operations in Persia in the spring of last year wnth a great flourish of trumpets. Kovacs, it was alleged, after making a name for himself as a construction engineer in the TInited States, had gathered round him an international staff of experts and formed a Company which was ready to undertake public enter prises to a total value of £100 millou in oriental countries. Its first task hud been to reclaim a large expanse of barren land in Turkey, involving the construction of a dam, for purposes of irrigation, 600 kilom. long, with such happy results that ihe Turkish Government now derived a considerable propor tion of its revenue trom this area ! The company had been attracted to Afgha nistan by Amanallah’s grandiose promises of employment, and its director was passing through Tehran ou his way to Afghanistan, accompanied by several39 members °f his technical sfaiT, when the revolution broke out in that country. They were prepared, they announced through the Tehran press, to place their TUi'rao t '- tr 31 f v h0 , ^ r8ian gratis, P merely in nnlcr to sojo^ri“ho lat/oTon^Kha^am'-- 46 ^ 1 an&lt;3 fragrant m0m ° rie3 ° f theU ‘ By ‘?P t T ber I \ ov . a ? s &gt; who was unable to meet his hotel hills when he of Tvsfie r?1 ed m obtalni 'g a number of contracts from the .Ministry carioir. rioVnl w 8 “,'' ey u wo . rl 5&gt; *™ m the Ministry of the Interior for cartogiaphical work, from the Municipality of Tehran for the constrnM-i in nf water clmnnels, &amp;c ami from the Ministry of Public Works for sumPy iobs bolh n ichran and as Mr. I inch relates, in the Province of Gilan.

T understand that the various contracts of Kovacs and his confederates have now been resiliated. Enclosure in No. 1. Vice-Consul Finch to Sir R. Clive. Resht, December 1929. I have the honour to inform you that the “ East Development Commnv,” an adventurous syndicate undertaking various public works in Gilan, has for the moment at least, come to an untimely end; leaving a considerable quantitv of debts. KcJ ereiice to this company has already been made in paragraph 3 of Legation hmws Circular No. 21, and in various paragraphs of my consular diaries during the past two or three months. T - rJ ;* l . e director is a Hungarian Jew, variously known as Rowans or Kutterstein. and other members are Kischkin, Baranv, Kalos, SchnLze and Nemhans—though I will not answer for the correct spelling of their names. A German beach-comber, of obscure antecedents, named Litmann, who is establish ed at Pahlavi, is also understood to be concerned in the venture. ^ 3. They were commissioned to draw up designs for a bridge across the Lahd Rud, a bridge to connect; Kazian with Pahlavi, and to survey buildings and properties in the province for the Department of Registration. * It is from the last of these that they made their principal hauls. The Ministry of Public Works seems at the start to have accepted as high a figure as 10 tomans per square kilometre as their surveying fees. The landowners protested, and the rate was precipitately reduced to 6 tomans, although the provincial director of the Sabt-i-Asnad alleges that he informed his superiors in Tehran that he eonld get it competently clone for 4, or even 3 tomans. While matters were at this stage,, the company began taking advances from landowners wis.hing to submit their properties for registration, most of whom were doubtless anxious to accommodate the company, in the hope of obtaining an assessment favourable to themselves : and, knowing the tangles of complication that gen era 11 v surround T ersian piopeities, the bait that a syndicate of this kind could offer would be considerable. On the strength of it they rented the prominent house in the Sabz Maidan belonging to blaji Rustam Badkubehi, and borrowed 4.000 or o.OOO tomans frmu their landlord, besides the advances already mentioned, some of which ran into four figures. And, in addition to liabilities for services*procured locally by the company, the individual members ran up a bill, collectively 720 taels, at the hotel where they lived on their arrival at the end of last summer and numerous accounts in the bazaar. What the total amounts to I am unable reliably to discover, but, according to information available, the Government were vary enough not to become creditors. On the 9th December the local Department of Registration announced that the contract was * 4 for various reasons ” suspended. The members are now understood to be in Tehran LclOOFD- »'■'I • 40 4 . The incident invites gloomy reflections upon the whole question of pub lic works in the Caspian provinces. The Governor-General informed me a abort while ago that he had authority to make contracts for works in Gilan amounting to a million tomans, including the Safid Rud and Pahlavi bridges, a large dam in the foothills of Shaft to improve the irrigation of the Fumen and Shaft areas, and a canal to bring the water of the Passikhan River to Resut. The tigure 4 % named is uoubtless one of the customary exaggerations, and the idea that such important contracts would be delegated to a provincial authority is most un likely ; nevertheless, considering only the works themselves, at least two of which are seriously contemplated, and adding to them the municipal buildings boulevards, hospitals, that are being run up in so many places, the coast road' the palace at Barfurush, the projected port at Habiba’bad (paragraph 13g of November diary), to say nothing of the railway and Bander-Shah, there seems to he no limit to the schemes desired to be brought to fruition all ai once. The opportunity must be a golden one for such adventurers as the East Develop ment Company to get iu and fritter away such resources as the country posses ses ; and this region, being deprived for geographical reasons of the element of free and healthy competition, seems to be peculiarly exposed to their acti vities. (29) Despatch from the British Embassy, Paris, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 233, dated the 1st Marck 1930. I have the honour to report that the Ex-Shah of Persia died in the American Hospital in Paris on February 27th. 2. Ahmed Kadjar had been suffering from tuberculosis of the kidneys for some time past, and it was this complaint which caused his death. The funeral service was held on February 28th at the Paris Mosque. 3. The Ex-Shah took up his residence in France after his deposition, lief was very rarely seen here either in public or in society.

In the penultimate paragraph of my telegram No. 57 of March 10th I made a brief allusion to a remark of the Minister of Court on the subject of Perso- Russian relations. 2. His Highness assured me that Davtian had been recalled because he was too moderate ; he added that this had been done at the instigation of Loga- nowski, the Counsellor. He went on to say that Loganowski—whose record in Warsaw and elsewhere is doubtless known to your Department—was a men of the most extreme views, who was strongly supported bv his Government and was allowed tar greater discretion than had ever been given to Davtian. He averred that Loganowski would have been appointed Ambassador or Minister in some important post if the Soviet Government had not feared that it might have been difficult to obtain his agrement. As it was he could be left for many months on end as Charge d’Affaires and no agrement would be required. So far as 1 know:, no steps have yet been taken by the Soviet Government to ap point a successor to Davtian. A copy of this despatch has been sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Gov ernment of India.41 (31) Memo, from H.

I have not yet been approached by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the matter, and consider it m,likely that that Ministry would raise officially a rvorvdVw? M ’ dem 4 a ^, Which they mi ^ hl make certainly Ct on eiy doub fu ioundatron. At the same time I consider that yon would be well advised to lake into consideration, as suggested in the circular despatch to which you roiei the nsk ol molestation incurred by your ferrashes, should they continue to wear kuilaus outside the grounds of the Consulate-General and the local effect of such molestation w British prestige. You will realize that it is im„ possible for the police to distinguish between ferrashes on and otf duty in the town, and wnile it would, theoretically at least, be possible to obtain an eventum apology for any incident of this sort which might occur, the incident itsclt woubl create a most undesirable impression locallv, and would inevitably receive a much wider publicity than the subsequent apology. 3. The practice at this Legation is for both ghulams and ferrashes to wear J an lev i caps (with the badge of the Legation) when outside the Legation whe ther they are on or off duty ; and though 1 am unwilling to issue definite instruc tions m a matter which is clearly dependent in part on local conditions I am of the opinion that the same practice might with advantage be adopted at’Bushire At the same time, however, 1 approve the line of action which you have taken hitherto : in the event of your deciding to supply your ferrashes with Pahlevi caps tor use outside the Consulate-General, it is essential to make it clear that you do so not in compliance with the Governor’s official demand, (which he had no right to make), but as a voluntary gesture and solely out of consideration lor Persian susceptibilities. Copies of this despatch have been sent to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and to the Government of India. (32) Memo, from H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, No. 44, dated the 5th April 1930. His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the subject of i—Persian Budget for the year 1309 (1930-^1931). To the Foreign Office, London, No. 146 of 5th April, 1930. Despatch from H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London No. 146, dated the 5th April 1930. With reference to my despatch No. 172 of March 28th. 1929, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the national* budget for the year 1309 &lt;1930—1931) which was passed by the Majlis on March 19th last without opposition. 2. The anticipated revenue, excluding the oil royalty which is again to be paid into the gold reserve fund, amounts to 353,374,827 Kraus and the estimated expenditure to 352,987,776 Krans, thus leaving a small surplus of 387,051 Krans,tkmr*~rrmz£i 42 The Ministry of P’mance have sho^Ti their inconsistency by including on f] ie revenue side the sums credited to education and public health from The road taxes, but excluding the balance of the road taxes and the revenue accruino- from the Sugar and Tea Monopoly. 3. The actual revenue collected and expenditure incurred in 1929-30 not having been published as yet, this budget, which was described as “ imaginary” by Doctor Schniewind in conversation with a member of my staff, can only be compared with the estimates for the previous year. The Government seem un duly optimistic and have in any case refrained from taking into consideration the probable adverse effects on trade of their present financial policy. An in crease, instead of a fall, in Customs revenue seems to be expected. The Opium Monopoly, though it has hitherto failed to come up to expectations, is never theless also counted upon for 13£ million Krans additional revenue, the Tobacco Monopoly for 23 million, the slaughter-house tax for 6 million, registration of property for 30 million. There are two fresh sources of revenue : a^registra- tion tax on motor cars from which it is hoped to obtain 8 million Kraus and a tax in income and trade licences which is estimated to bring in 13 million Krans. 4. The Ministry of War is credited wdth the same colossal sum, in terms of the total expenditure, as the year before, i.e., 123 odd million Krans, while 22 millions only are devoted to education (an increase of 2 millions) and 7 to public health. The Ministry of Justice’s credit of 17.9 million Krans represents an increase of 2 millions over the previous year. The newly created Ministry of National Economy is given a budget of 2 million Krans only, but various credits totalling 29 million Krans are opened for specific “ economic ” purposes, including 8 million Krans for the purchase of a navy in the Persian Gulf, and 10 million Krans to be added to the capital of the National Bank, half of which tor a new agricultural department. Expenditure on roads and railway construc tion is not mentioned but there is sure to be an appreciable saving where the railway is concerned. 5. As mentioned in my despatch under reference the 1929-30 budget fore shadowed a deficit of 48.3 million Krans. There was, however, a tendency to cut clown expenditure as much as possible in order to reduce this estimated deficit to a minimum. The Government also had at that time? their sterling re serve in Europe to fall back upon. The tendency at present is towards increased expenditure (exclusive of the railway) which can only be met by new taxes and higher prolits from government trading institutions/both of which must cause sc no iir, in.iuiy to Persian trade in the long run apart from discouraging private initiative, while the sterling reserve has now been definitely earmarked in con nection with the introduction of a gold standard. t r ^ 0 ^ I i° c ‘ e5: P a ^ c h an( f enclosure have been sent to the Government of India and His Majesty's High Commissioner for ’Iraq, Baghdad.

M.’s Minister, Tehuan, No. 45, dated the 5th April 1930. His Britannic Majesty's Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the subject of :—Russo-Persian relations. To the Foreign Office, London, No, 147 of 5th April, 1930, Despatch from II. M.’s Mthjstfr, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 147, dated the 5th April 1930. About a fortnight ago the Minister of Court informed me that there had recently been an increasing movement of people trying to escape from Russia across the frontier into Persia, not only into Azerbaijan but also into Khorasan. He described this mainly to the famine conditions in Russia and in part to the campaign against the ‘ kulaks 2. A few days’ later I received a telegram from His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz informing me that a state of revolt was spreading round Nakhchevan and that six hundred Caucasian Muslims had crossed the frontier lo Ardebil. At another point on the frontier one hundred and liffcy refugees when attempting to cross tlie river Araxes were fired on by Russian troops hut only twelve succeeded in getting across into Persia, the rest being shot down in the water or drowned. Mr. Palmer further reported that the Russian troops at Nakhchevan and on the river nou numbered some three thousand. 3. I enquired of the Minister of Court of a few days ago whether he had received confirmation of these reports from Tabriz ; he said that he had and that the increasing number of these refugees was becoming a serious problem. There was no question of returning them to Russia where they would certainly be shot. The Persian authorities therefore were bound to give such facilities as were possible to enable them to settle down in this country. 4. There is little doubt that Persian Soviet relations are tending to deterio rate. In the beginning of February a Russian newspaper in Baku published a violent attack on the present regime in Persia. In spite of the censorship, ex tracts from this article found their ivay into the Persian press. Cm the 13th March the semi-official Iran published the article in full together with a reply which was couched in equally offensive terms. I asked Teymourtache whether it was with his knowledge and approval that this reply to the Baku article had been published. He said that Loganovsky, the Soviet Charge d’Affaires, had asked him the same question, and that he had replied that not only had the Iran published their arliele, with his full knowledge and approval but that every.time the Russian press attacked His Majesty the Shah and the present regime in Persia the Persian press would publish two articles in renly criticising the Soviet regime. His Highness went on to say that he considered these attacks in the Russian press,' which was under the closest censorship, an intoler able breach of the friendly relations which were supposed to exist between the two countries. He complained that the Soviet Government were apparently taking no steps to appemt a new Ambassador to succeed Davtian and he had accordingly telegraphed to the Persian Ambassador in Moscow to enquire when the Soviet Government proposed to appoint a successor. 5. I enclose a French translation of the Baku article and of the Iran’s reply as published in the Messager de Teheran ”. Copies of this despatcli and enclosure have been sent to the Government of India and His Majesty’s High Commissioner for ’Iraq, Baghdad.47 of anxiety to the Persian Government. At present there was said to he a so- ealled Kurdish Government in the neighbourhood of Mount Ararat which even included a Minister for Foreign Affairs. 2. At the same time he had heard that there was a certain sympathy oh the part oi British officials in ’Iraq with the movement for an independent Kurdistan, and that Sheikh. Mahmud had been approached by leaders of the movement. The Turkish press had recently* reported that Colonel Lawrence was in Kurdistan and he understood that this report had been reproduced in the native ’Iraq press. He said he would be very grateful if I could obtain any news on the subject from Baghdad. 1 told him that, first, as regards Colonel Lawrence I was getting rather tired of hearing these stories of his presence in various parts of Western and Central Asia, and that as regards the svmpathv of British officials in ’Iraq with a Pan-Kurdish movement frankly T did not believe it. However, ais he had asked me T would report what he had said to Baghdad for any observations which the High Commissioner might wish to make. 3. Teymourtache also referred in the course of this conversation to the 11 Mussowat ” party for an independent Caucasia whose headquarters were now in Constantinople. The programme of this group had always been inimical to Persia as it included an “ united ” Azerbaijan comprising the whole Persian pro vince as, far south as Zenjan. While the “ Mussowat ” party need not be taken very seriously, it would be interesting to knoAv, he said, what connection, if any, fitov norj v-jth the present movements for an independent Armenia and an United Kurdistan. 4.

Despatch from IT. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 160, dated the 18th April, 1930. With reference to my despatch No. 578 of November 25th, last fEncl. of Serial No. (15) File No. 17-N.|29], paragraph 5, I have the honour to report that Mirza Hassan Khan Mushar resigned the portfolio of Minister of Finance on April 10th. 2. Since his appointment in November last he had had innumerable difficul ties to contend with and it was not long before ho perceived that a Minister under the present regime was not the sole authority in his Ministry. It is no secret that he was not in agreement with many of the financial laws recently passed and he also disagreed in many points with the Budget drawn up for the present year. In order to reduce expenditure in the new estimates he had been called upon fo economise Tomans three hundred thousand in his own Ministry and had grud- gino-lv accepted. Later he was called upon to give up another Tomans three hundred thousand bv effecting various economies and dismissing officials. He declined to do this, told the Minister of Court that he had better dose down the Ministry of Finance alogethcr and sent in his resignation. The Minister of Court visited him shortly afterwards and endeavoured to persuade him to take back his resignation hut without success. He then enquired whom he (Mushar) thought the best man to make Minister of Finance. Mushar replied without hesitation that Teymourtache had better take it on himself and when the letter (in ted out that h ; -&gt; present occupations would not permit of that, Mushar pro posed Davar, the Minister of Justice.48 3. The next day, Assad, the Minister of war, visited Mushar in an endeavour to persuade him to withdraw his resignation but with no success. Mushar, how ever, told him plainly that one of the principal reasons for his resignation was the unceasing interference in his Ministry of Teymourtache. He recapitulated his points of complaint and said that the last straw was a demand for such econo mies in his Ministry as would completely paralyse its usefulness. 4. In spite of further endeavours from other Ministers and from the Shah’s Private Secretary, Mushar persisted in his resignation and on the 13th the Press almounced that His Majesty had accepted it and had charged the Under Sec retary to carry on the Ministry until the appointment of a new Minister. 5. It was obvious from the first that a man, of Mushar’s austere and obstinate character would not willingly brook outside interference in his administration and that if he were not strong enough to resist it he would resign. The present Cabinet Ministers are regarded as mere servants of the Minister of Court and it is common knowledge that they do as he bids them, but Mushar is a man of a ditferent stamp and his refusal to accept the same treatment has surprised no body. 6. At the last interview I had with Teymourtache, he asked me whether I could suggest anyone for the post of Minister of Finance. I replied that this was somewhat outside my province, but asked him whether Pavar had been ap proached. His Highness said that Davar was still indispensable at the Ministry of Justice where it was hoped that he would remain for another two years in order to complete the reorganisation of the judicial machinery. Havar, he added, was far the ablest man in the present Cabinet and he looked upon him as a future president of the Council. The Ministry of Finance however presented the greatest difficulty for the moment. There as really no one in the country fit to take it over. 7. 1 imagine that the Shah would like to induce Vossuq-ed-Dowleh to stop into the breach, but I should be exceedingly surprised if Vossuq, accepted. 8. It was at this point of our conversation that I referred to the difficulties of the Imperial Bank of Persia which had been occasioned by recent legislation. I am reporting on this separately. I finally suggested to His Highness that what Persia seemed to be in need of was some expert financial advice and when he asked where this was to be obtained I said that the League of Nations had furnished this to seveial countries with great advantage. It had evidently never occurred to him to apply to the League for a Financial Adviser and he appeared to be attracted by the idea, but I much doubt the Persian Government ever doing so, as they would realise that advisers supplied by the League could hardly be treated vith the same indifference as advisers selected bv themselves on their own terms. . .

I am told that owners of touring cars plying for hire, which are already being run at entirely uneconomic rates, will be most seriously affected. The value of second hand care has already fallen between ten and twenty per cent, since the enactment of this law T . 3. ' Ten tomans a month is a great deal to pay even for private owners of cars, in view of the deplorable state of the roads, and I imagine that nuite a fair number of persons will be compelled to give them up. I understand that some of the smaller buses plying on the Tehran-Gulhek road have already disap peared. Copies of this despatch and enclosures are being ^ent to the Government of India, His Majesty's High Commissioner for Iran, the Department of Overseas Trade and to all His Majesty's Consular Officers in Persia. Law passed in the sitting of 1st April 1930 of the Majlis, imposing new registra tion taxes on means of transport. Article 1 .—With effect from the enforcement of this act the following regis tration fees will be collected from transport in monthly instalments as follows :— (a) Trucks :— 66 tomans yearly. 84 tomans. 108 tomans. 120 tomans yearly. 180 tomans. 36 tomans. 36 tomans. 18 tomans. 12 tomans.

Article 3.—The owners of transport mentioned in the above two articles mast inform the local financial agency within two weeks, of the vehicles in their posses sion ; otherwise double the taxes ciuc will be collected irom them foi any penod during which they may have not paid taxes. In case of refusal the vehicles will be confiscated and if after six months, double-the amount of the tax has not been paid the transport will be sold and double tax will be charged up to the date of the sale together with the expenses of keeping the vehicles and the balance will be refunded to the owner. Should the owners of vehicles desire to la'* them dp they must inform the local financial agency of the fact so that the said vehicles may be sealed by the SVO)50 agency. In this case no tax will be collected until the time the seal is broken which must be carried out in the 'presence of the agency’s representative. jVofe 1 .—For the testing and trying of vehicles which is customary at the time of sale, the financial agencies are responsible on the request of both parties to the bargain, for re- moving the seal and issuing a temporary permit for testing or repairing the vehicle. Note 2 .—Should the owner of a vehicle fix a special plac£ where his vehicle ean be kept during confiscation, the financial agencies will agree.

Monsieur Brossier has given the following information. He is annoyed with the Press for publishing incorrect reports. His mission is to establish two W/T. stations and one central office, the whole project at an estimated cost of approximately £52,000. The stations are as follows :— Kasr Kajar. On the Gulhek road, three miles north of Tehran. This station was originally established by the Russians, under instructions from Shah Reza when he was Minister of War. It was a failure, only having a radius of 2,000 kilometres. The French mission have reorganised this station and installed two Sulzer engines of 100 and 60 H. P. respectively, which corres pond to 134 and 80 kilowats. This station will, it is hoped, be capable of world wide communication. It is to be noted that it is only a transmission station. Najafabad. Just outside and East of Tehran city, between the Dolab and old Meshed gate. Two Sulzer engines of 20 and 15 H. P. corresponding to 27 and 20 kilowats. Receiving station only. Supposed to be able to receive from Japan and Western Europe. Central Office. In the Sip&amp;h Maid an, in the centre of the town. Connected by under ground cable with the above two stations. Comments. The project will probably be completed by March of this year. The difficulty will bo whom to hand it over* to as, according to Monsieur Brossier, “ there are no Persians available of sufficient training or ability.” The two Frenchmen with Monsieur Brossier’s mission are, at present, the only skilled hands in the stations. European trained Persians are available but it appears that their training was insufficient and their aptitude is nil. Monsieur Brossier has asked for three more skilled Frenchmen but has been informed by the Persian Minister that this is unlikely to be sanctioned on account of lack of funds. Fifteen Persian students went to Europe (France) last June for one year’s course in W./T. Monsieur Brossier is of opinion that this will prove a waste of time as nothing like sufficient can be learnt in one year and he finds Persians are not quick at learning such technical matter. As regards broadcasting, overtures have been made to Monsieur Brossier to include receiving and relaying European broadcasts in the work for which he has contracted. He will have nothing to do with it, pointing out that his mission is here to establish efficient long range wireless for commercial purposes and broadcasting, in any of his phases, has no part in this scheme.

No 67 of 8th February 1930 Concerning visit on 28th January to Bander * Abbas of H. M. S. “ Crocus. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 67, dated the 8th February 1930. I was somewhat surprised a few days ago to receive a letter from the Minister of Foriegn Affairs requesting me to call on him as he wished to have an exchange of views on a subject about which he preferred not to write officially. 2. I called on His Excellency on February 4th at the time appointed. Farzin then referred to a visit on January 28th to Bander Abbas of H. M. S. &lt;&lt; Oocus ” He said that a report had been received from the officer com manding at Bander Abbas to the effect that 7 officers had landed, together with about 40 or 50 men, and a number of Indian soldiers and that this landing had had the appearance of a naval demonstration. According to this report His Majesty’s Consul at Bander Abbas was on board the Crocus . 3 T first enquired of His Excellency whether any report had been received from the Governor of Bander Abbas. He said no, the report m +• End h^on received by the Ministry of W ar from the Persian officer to command I said that it was surely rather for the Governor than for a m commai . • f the p ers ian Government if it was considered that .wf,IdtenamthtoTirregular in the visit of H.

In ienlv to his question I told him that I had had no report of any kind on the mibtoct of this visit, in fact I was quite unaware that the visit had taken subject ot t . nothing whatever unusual in this as place until he to.d me but in r ^ with s the Persian Government His according to t f ie Persian Gulf were entitled to visit any port although Majesty s Ships in t ib i t „ i c no tice to the local authorities, ^Th mlMatty’^onsSrSadvance. As regard the insinuation that through His Majs&gt; f naval demonstration this was ridiculous; more- there had c &gt; are n0 Indian Marines were carried on any of His oyer so far as I was a , no proba bly the Persian officer had mistaken the Majesty s Ship m the • A •• w hat objection was there to 40 or 50 Somali stokers for Indian soldiers, a am w j had doae so ? Most members of the crew lan ^ f ei „ n war ships, and if officers and men landed countries welcom^ the v^«omg b ^ P ^ better for th , , and spent some mon y, 7 P c oasu i wa s on board it was probably merchants. Agam if Hi •- ^ it[ b his consu i ar district, he desired because being at Henjamwhicn was w that H M S. “Crocus” to return to as given to me by His Excellency I declined to should take him. On th jJLeular at all and I could only express my s'urpilsXfheVartlought^t necessary to ask me to come and hear what18 appeared to be quite an irrelevant complaint. I wont on to say that in fact His Majesty’s Ships had during the past year so far as I knew, paid very ^ few visits to Persian ports. The attitude of the local authorities was never • such as to render a visit particularly agreeable ; if it was not the Governor himself the Customs Superintendent of the Quarantine Officer appeared almost to go out of their way to make difficulties, in fact I quite failed to understand the general attitude of the Persian authorities towards His Majesty’s Ships. On the one hand His Majesty’s Ships paid very infre quent visits to Persian ports and were then received with scant courtesy, on the other hand the presence of His Majesty s Ship in the Gulf appeared to me to be of inestimable benefit to Persia in that, thanks to their presence and to their presence alone, the arms traffic and slavery had been reduced to the very smallest proportions. His Majesty’s Government wished nothing better than for friendly co-operation between His Majesty’s Ships and the Persian authorities. As I had repeatedly said His Majesty’s Government in no way questioned any Persian sovereign rights, and respected Persian territorial waters. I had explained to the Minister of Couit that we were asking nothing unsual or contrary to international custom in proposing that His Majesty’s Ships should be free to visit Persian ports by simple notification instead of by the cumbrous formalities of requesting permission on every occasion through diplomatic channels but it aj)peared very difficult to over come Persian suspicions and I did not see how we were ever to establish really friendly relations until the Persian authorities ceased to suspect every action on our part as having an ulterior motive. 4. Farzin repeated the usual platitudes about Persia’s desire for the friendship of His Majesty’s Government but I hope he will repeat the gist of what I said to the Minister of Court and to the Council of Ministers. 6. Since writing the above I have received a telegram from His Majesty’s Consul at Bander Abbas of whom I enquired whether there had been any irregularity in connection with the visit of H. M. S. “ Crocus ”. Mr. Richardson has telegraphed as follows : “ I am not aware of any irregularity on this occasion.

I have the honour to forward for your information a copy of letters* addressed to me by the Smior Naval Oifieer, with enclosures, commenting on certain incidents which have recently occurred with regard to visits of His Majesty’s Ships to southern ports and the general attitude of the Persian authorities on such occasions. 2. If the new treaty is to be signed at an early date, presumably satisfac tory arrangements will be arrived at regarding the question of the visits of men-of-war to the southern ports and a definite procedure laid down, and it is to be hoped that the Persian authorities will disp’ay greater courtesy in the future than they have done in the past. If the area of Henjam, within which the British Naval authorities are to enjoy certain privileges, is demar cated and the interference of the Persian authorities definitely excluded from this area one cause of friction will have been eliminated. 3. If on the oth r hand it is improbable that the treaty negotiations will be concluded in the near future, then I would suggest, for your consider ation that on the next occasion on which any discourtesy is shown to His Majesty’s Naval forces at Ilenjam we should ask for the removal of the official concerned. Only so can the Persian authorities be brought to under stand that we will no longer tolerate perpetual and constant discourtesies at the hands of officials of such petty status that at any of the important cities in the interior of Persia they would not have the honour of being received by a British Consular officer. 4. As regards the conduct of the Governors of Abadan and Bandar \bbas I would invite your attention to the facts reported in paragraph 7 of the Senior Naval Officer’s 1 tter to the Commander-m-Chief, East Indies Station No 42/A/42/5, dated the 16th February 1930, regarding the astonishing reception given to the Shaikh of Debai. Up till recently the noHcv of the Persian Government has been to harass any Arab notable who visited Persia. Last year Shaikh Mohammed of Bahrain, brother of the Deputy P.uler, was put to very great inconvenience when he came to Persia to hawk Now apparently the Persian authorities are trying different tactics and Arab notables are received in the most friendly and conciliatory manner It is impossible not to form the conclusion that the attitude of th \ n In the G- If is direcGv inspired from Tehran, and if SSS” ..”“e ..

From the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, H. M. S. -Triad” to the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, No 42-A/I2/5, DATED THE 16TH FEBRUARY 1930 (CONFIDENTIAL). (Copy t0 the Honourable the Resident in the Persian Gulf.)20 which took place upon the occasions of their recent visits to Abadan and Bunder Abbas respectively. H. M. S. “ Lupin ” letter 751/25-G., dated 3rd February 1930, H. M. S. “ Crocus ” letter 24-K., dated 10th February 1930. It is convenient to consider these two reports together because the subject of each is in actual fact the same namely, the apparent total inability 0S of Persian officials to conduct themselves in official matters like reasonable men. 2. During the past two years there has been a remarkable series of these incidents so astonishing in their details that anyone without experience in this part of the world would, on reading the reports, be quite justified in refusing to believe them for they seem to record the hallucinations of a dis ordered brain rather than words and actions of the responsible official of a civilised country holding a seat upon the Council of the League of Nations. Many of the incidents which have occurred during the past two years have not been reported ; to have sent complete records would have necessi tated an increase to the office staff and equipment of the Senior Naval Officer and, as has been previously reported, when His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Teheran visited Henjam in October 1929: “He said he was astounded at what he saw at Henjam and added that the truth of the position there had never been reported to him ; he then admitted that if the truth had been reported to him he wouM as a human b:ing have found it impossible to believe.” 3. As regards going alongside and landing libertymen at Abadan the Senior Naval Officer would remind the Commander-in-Chief of the following :— The visit of H. M. S. “ Enterprise ” in April 1928, H. M. S. “ Fnterprise ” submission 32-J of 19th April 1928. The visit of H. M. S. “ Lupin ” in January 1929. Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf submission 44/54/3 of 19th January 1929. The visit of H. M. S. “ Lupin” in March 1929. Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf submission 44-K/119/8 of 6th June 1929. The incidents now reported shows that the efforts of two years have resulted in no improvement whatever, in fact rather the contrary because on tlie present occasion although Pratique had been given the Police even prevented the Admiralty Inspector of Oil Fuel from going on board. The Senior Naval Officer has no idea as to the reason for this. 4. As regards the matter reported by “ Crocus ” the Senior Naval Officer has on various occasions remarked upon the power or impotence of various classes of Persian officials (inter alia Telegrams 0832, 2nd February 1929, 1537 of 5th February 1929 and submission 3511/42A/40/2, dated 9th August 1929). The title of Governor, as we know it, seem a complete misnomer for any of the Persian officials in the Gulf. One could not imagine the Deputy Governor of even the most insignificant of the British possessions stealing a loaf of bread from the Collector of Customs and then being chased for his life by his victim around the walls of his own residence as happened in Henjam twelve months ago. 5. It is not necessary to refer in greater detail to the many incidents which have occurred at the Southern end of the Gulf but the Senior N aval Officer would refer the Commander in-Chief to the following :— Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, submission 44 of 15th July 1928. Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, submission 44/51/6 of 21st January 1929. A Series of telegrams concerning a proposedVisit by H. M. S. ” Triad to Bandar Abbas in which Admiralty gave a decision in mes sage 1450 of the 26th January 1929.m 21 r 6. A study of that invaluable work of reference Lorimer’s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf shows that this behaviour of Persian officials towards British ships and representatives generally has continued for a hundred years or more and a recent Political Resident^ Sir Lionel Haworth, K. B. E., in formed the Senior Naval Officer that he thought the incidents now occurring were due to the awakening sense of nationalism. Sir Lionel also informed the Senior Naval Officer that in all dealings with Persian officials it is necessary to remember two things :— (a) That they are a nation of Poker players. (b) That, among their officials, the telling of lies is regarded as “ Haute Politique As regards (a) it is amusing to remember the story that upon the occa sion of the visit of the French Armed Yacht “ Diane” towards the end of 1928 the Persian officials at Bushire threatened trouble in connection with the landing of their personnel :—the French Consul thereupon retorted ^h^ he would call on her Commanding Officer to land an armed party. The objections were withdrawn without delay. 7. The exact cause of all these incidents at Persian Ports is difficult to discover. May be it is some form of what is known as an “ Inferiority Complex ” manifesting itself towards Europeans or in fact white men. But whatever the cause is while Europeans are subjected to Quarantine, Passnort and multitudinous other restrictions it is very well worthy to note the treatment now being accorded to the Sheikh of Debai who is on hunting tour in Kishm Island. When it was known that he was about to commence this tour the chief official at Lingah sent him an invitation to visit that nlace as well as Kishm promising him all forms of entertainment at no expense Not only had he no need to think of Passports or Arms Permits bu? eifts of rifles, shot guns and ammunition were almost laid at his feet, tentf and servants provided, etc. The Sheikh however refused these offers and arrived in Kishm with his own tents, etc., and armed ret a-ners fifty strom™ He informed the Senior Naval Officer of all this when he came over to Heniam vesterdav 15th February and added that the Persians were will- WK allowing hnn til draw his provisions, including the monopoly elements tea and sugar, from Debai without his dhow even having a formal cust inspection.

Letter from the Commander, H. M. S. “ Crocus ”, to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, No. 24-K., dated the 10th February 1930. I have the honour to submit the following report on my visit to Bandar Abbas from noon, 28th January until 07-00, 31st January 1930. 2. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Mr. Richardson, who took passage in H. M. S. “ Crocus ” landed about noon on the 28th January, and immedi ately obtained permission from His Excellency the Governor of Bandar Abbas for the Officers and Ship’s Company of “ Crocus ” to land that after noon for exercise. 3. The ships company and officers landed that afternoon and no objection was raised. 4. On the forenoon of the 29th, by previous arrangement, and accom panied by H. B. M.’s Consul, I called on His Excellency the Governor. I was very politely received and when I asked about the ship’s company and officers landing during the afternoon for exercise, I was told there was no objection at all and that there was a football ground where they could kick about on, if they wished. 5. When leaving, I told His Excellency the Governor, that should he care to return my call that day, which was a very fine one, I could if he wished, send my motor boat for him, as I knew he had no boat of his own. He replied “ he regretted he had too many letters to write ”. 6. On my return to the ship I found that the wardroom Steward, Can teen Manager and Interpreter had landed at 10-00 that morning to purchase provisions. They were stopped at the Pier by armed soldiers and police and told that no one was allowed to land. They returned to the ship. 7. I requested H. B. M.’s Consul, to inquire from the Governor for the reason for this unfriendly act. 8. He sent a messenger to the Governor, who gave him to understand that he had given no orders to stop anyone landing, but thac the Command ing Officer of Persian Troops, Bandar Abbas, and the Chief of Police, did not acknowledge his authority and had probably acted on their own.23 Cf 1 9. Mr. Richardson wrote to him to confirm this and also telephoned to the Commanding Officer of Persian Troops, who denied all ^now fdge However, when informed that an Officer and Armed Guard were actually on the Pier, he promised to remove them. 10. Mr. Richardson was unable to obtain any assurances from the Chief .of Police. Consequently I stopped all leave that day. 11. The next morning, 30th January, I sent the Stewards in again for provisions at *0-00. No objection was raised at all. The Officers landed that afternoon and met with no interference. 19 On February 7th, whilst “ Crocus ” was at Henjam, Mr. Richardson telephoned to “Jm Bandar Abbas, to say that H. M’s Minister at Tehran had P wired to him that the Officer Commanding Troops, Ba ' d ( ^ e .

It will be observed that the system is quite an elaborate adaptation of the electoral arrangements of France and Belgium, and the result is certain ly a Majlis of Persians elected from constituencies, sitting for two years, hold ing periodical debates, passing laws and ratifying treaties. Anyone who has had any contact with it, however, is driven to the conclusion that the Majlis, at present, does very little except follow the instructions given to it by the Government, and it seems to be principally useful in obstructing measures which the Government does not wish passed. I should divide my critical comments upon the present electoral system in Persia under two main heads : firstly, the unsuitability of the system to Persia in its present condition, and secondly, the undoubted governmental interference in every important phase of the Majlis’s activities. 3. The electoral system, however, good on paper, does not result in the focussing and centralisation of Persian public opinion in Tehran. It is doubtful whether there is any public opinion on most of the problems the Majlis has to discuss. The electorate is very largely illiterate and quite ignorant of questions of national importance and of foreign policy. Deputies need not have any residential connexion with their constituencies, and they may spend any amount^ of money on their electoral campaign. A number of constituencies are composed of peasants who still live in almost feudal sub jection to their overlords, and therefore vote as he directs, the result often being that the overlord himself is elected, usually a good thing, but liable to various abuses. There is no proportional representation, nor (a much more serious defect) are there any political parties in our sense of the words. In fact, no candidate goes to his constituency with any broad political pro gramme ; all he can do is to blow his own trumpet and point to his past record as showing his suitability for election. 4. The interference of the Government in the elections and in the work of the Majlis is, perhaps, a more fundamental defect than those mentioned in the preceding paragraph. It shows itself in the following ways :— (а) The Governor-General, or Governor, has a great deal of power in the elections. He is, of course, a permanent official of the * Ministry of the Inferior, and in practice he seems to be able to run the elections in the way he has been instructed by Tehran. He has extensive powers of cancellation of votes. (б) What actually happens is that the Government select their own candidates and tell the Ministry of the Interior, or the Gover nor direct, whom to have elected. (c) Should any undesirable person be elected, the Majlis has extensive powers of quashing the election on some excuse or other ; the power being exercised by a number of committees chosen by the Deputies from amongst themselves and influenced by the Government, for they owe their election to the latter. (d) The Majlis though theoretically free to reject Government mea sures, in practice passes what it is told to pass by the Govern ment. (e) The Majlis has no say in the appointment of Cabinet Ministers, and never interpellates on matters of public policy. It exer cises no effective control over public expenditure ; nor does it control the acts (often extremely arbitrary) of the chief of police. (/) It often appears that the Government makes use of the Deputies in forming Majlis opinion on certain matters in accordance with the Government’s own design; for example, artificial anti-British feeling appears to be fostered and encouraged among the Majlis members; while conversely, the genuine anti-Russian feeling engendered by the recent commercia exploitation of the north of Persia has been suppressed and notl allowed to find expression.25 (gr) The Government has lately been known to ignore the legal rules and to impose its will on the Majlis; for instance, Deputies who have been required to serve as Governors in provincial posts have been appointed to those posts in defiance of the rule to the contrary. 5. The Government in fact, is completely master of the Majlis ; just, as, at present, the Minister of Court is completely master of the Government. How long this state of affairs is likely to last remains to be seen. Perhaps the only real use of the present Majlis is that it acts as a safety valve for a certain amount of talk on unimportant matters. It is a nominates body masqu erading under the title of an elected assembly. Enclosure in No. 1. Report on the System of Electoral Representation in Persia. The system of electoral representation in Persia is based upon French and Belgian examples. The National Constituent Assembly, known as the Majlis, has passed a law on the subject, which is entitled “ Qanun-i- Intikhabat ” or “ The Law of Elections.” The instructions laid down in the law are amplified by a “Nizam Nameh” or ordinance published by the Ministry of the Interior for the guidance of officials charged with election duties. 2 The practical working of the system is as follows: Five months before the end of the existing term of the Majlis the Ministry of the In- terior sends written instructions to provincial Governors-General and Gover nors in each electoral area, s mding paper, printed forms, ballot papers, etc. Each official is ordered to proceed with the elections m such a way that, on the first dav of the last three months of the existing term of the Majlis the ‘ Anjuman-i-Nuzzar ” (Committee of Supervisors) m every electoral area issues notices concerning the holding of the elections. S When these instructions reach the Governor-General or Governor, he proceeds with the appointment of a Committee of Supervisors, referred to above. The Committee is appointed in the fo lowing elaborate way: Twenty-four persons of the six recognised social classes, (1) mullasor rXlnns men (2) gentry, (3) landed proprietors, (4) merchants, (5) trade guilds and (6) cultivators, are invited to attend the Governor. In addition to these twelve persons of known respectability and correctness of be- haviour ’having qualifications necessary for voters, and knowing how to read and w ri te g are also invited. When two-thirds of the number of per- attend Quorum is considered to be formed, and members proceed t° elect either from among themselves or from other persons by secret ^t 1 nine members who shall form the Committee of Supervisors. In vote nine ^mb. wn supplementry members, m order that if 7the firs ’nine y btome unabFe P to Carry on the duties cf members of any of thc Qn meone will be ready to take their places. All of these this committee, so t0 be c hosen from the persons present at supplementary me electoral area any of the above-mentioned six SITS. d' »ol «»&gt;. th. requisite uuitai -ill be eleeted from other T — &lt;' ■ • ■ » province contains se jer e ™ yince&gt; this area including districts such of Shiraz, the chief tow Tn ihcse cases the rule is that each provincial ^as its^ Com- four member, „„i„ g nn the committees of provincial districts. 4 Each Committee of Supervisors has one president, one vice-president and at least four secretaries.$ 5. When each committee is elected, it publishes and circulates a notice to the electors of the electoral area, notifying them of the place and times at which the committee will sit in order to give out “ ta’rifehs” (permissions to vote). The notice also states (a) the qualifications necessary for the electors and for the elected ; (b) the procedure of issuing the “ ta’rifeh,” mentioning that the 0* elector will have to record his vote at the same time as he receives his “ ta’rifeh ” ; and (c) the numbers of Deputies who are to be elected. A copy of a translation of a “ ta’rifeh ” is given in the appendix. 6. At the prescribed times the committee holds its meetings in the pre sence of a representative of the Governor. A box for the reception of votes is first prepared and shown to be empty. The committee then issues “ ta’rifehs ” to those who apply for them, registering them in a book in order that the names can be compared with the registers of the department of personal registration (“ sijill-i-ahw&amp;i ”). When a voter has obtained his “ ta’rifeh ” he has to write the name of the candidate or candidates he favours on a blank piece of paper, which he places in the ballot-box before he leaves the place. On placing his piece of paper in the box he shows his “ ta’rifeh,” which is then cancelled and returned to him. If the election does not finish at one sitting the committee seals up the opening of the ballot-box and leaves it with the Governor for the next sitting. 7. At the conclusion of the days appointed for the elections, the com- mitteee has to hold sittings for a fortnight in order to receive complaints against the election. Each complaint has to be examined, decided and filed in a proces-verbal. 8. At the conclusion of the elections the president of the committee opens the ballot-box in the presence of the members of the committee, and superin tends the reading out of the votes. The number of voting papers is first ascertained, and compared with the number in the registers. If there is a surplus, the excess is withdrawn at random from the number of votes before they are read. 9. One of the members of the committee then reads out aloud each voting paper, handing it over after reading to another member to check it, and at least three members of the committee write down the votes. If in any vote the number of names is greater than the number of persons to be elected, an appropriate number of the names, beginning from the last, are considered null and void. If the vote is illigible, or the name wrongly written, or unidentified, that vote is considered null and void, and the voting paper is annexed to the prcces-verbal. 10. When all the votes are read and computed, the president of the com mittee announces at once, by word of mouth, the result of the election. The voting papers are kept intact until the termination of the elections, when they are destroyed in the presence of a number of notable persons of the area and of the Governor. 11. The provincial committees act in the same way as the Central Com mittee ; they send in the result of their elections, together with a proces-verbal signed by all the members, to the Central Committee, which combines all the votes of the provincial committees and so arrives at the final result. If any provincial committee fails to send in the result of its elections within a time limit appointed by the Central Committee, the latter considers the elections of that provincial area as cancelled. The voters of that area have the right of filing objections to this cancellation. 12. A proces-verbal of the Central Committee concerning a provincial committee must be d-awn up in triplicate. One copy is sent to the Governor, another goes to the Majlis through the Governor and the last is sent to the provincial committee. The proces-verbal must be signed by all the members otf the committee. 13. Any complaints which are addressed to a provincial committee are not decided by that committee, but must be forwarded to the Central Com mittee. The latter examines and decides them. The original petition of complaint, with the procts-verbal and the decision of the Central Committee,27 must be forwarded to a special commission appointed by the Majlis which S a pl 3 enar e y m s Ht*ng a Subsequentl y sub;uits its decision'to the Majlis itself U. Complaints against the conduct of the elections, or the committees, can also be made direct to the Majlis within the first month of its existence. Elections which are decided to have been influenced by threats or bribery are considered null and void, and those guilty of such acts are sentenced to prison for from three to twelve months and deprived of the privilege of voting in the following one or two elections. 1 QC 1 5; Th ® t ? ta, ,lu ? nbe r of Deputies, laid down in the Electoral Law, is .“ cn 'all ot tins number plus one have assembled in Tehran the new Majlis is opened. The terms of each Majlis is two solar years, commencing * r0 I? , e t ime when the credentials of three-quarters of the Deputies who are m Tehran have been accepted by the Majlis. 16. The qualifications necessary for voters are as follows They must be Persian subjects, of 20 years of age at least, of m le sex, domiciled permanently in the electoral area, or having resided in it for at least six months immediately preceding the election. The following are excluded :— Women, minors (under 20 years of age), persons of unsound mind, persons under wardship according to religious law, foreigners, those whose apostacy has been proved in the presence of a mujtahid, fraudulent bankrupts beggars, persons living by immoral or dishonourable means, murderers, those convicted of felony or offences punishable according to Islamic law by flogging or religious penalties, political offenders who have rebelled or acted against the National Government or the Persian Constitution, naval and military officers (except honorary officers), officers of the “ amnieh ” (road guards) and police on duty in the electoral area concerned. 17. The qualifications necessary for candidates are :— They must be Moslems, or of the three other recognised creeds, Christians, Zorastrians and Jews ; they must be Persian nationals, must know how to read and write Persian and must be well known in their electoral area. They must be aged between 30 and 70 years and must have a reputation for honesty. The following classes of persons are excluded :— Princes of the blood, sons, brothers and cousins of the Shah, women, foreigners, officers of the “ amnieh ” (road guards), the police and of naval and military rank (except honorary officers), Governors-General and all classes of Governors and Deputy Governors, within tie area of their governorship (other Government officials are eligible for election, but if elected must resign their posts for the duration of the Majlis), fraudulent bankrupts, murderers, persons convicted of felony or of offences punishable under Islamic law, persons guilty of public acts of indecency or immorality, or whose irrefigion or apostacy from Islam has been proved before a qualified religious authority or is publicly known, political offenders, or those who have rebelled aga'nst the National Government or have acted aga nst the independence of Persia. Subsequent amending laws of 1306, during the sixth term of the Majlis., exclu ded, in addition, the following categories All presidents of courts, public prosecutors and public advocates, when within the province where they are officially employed, all directors of Government Departments in their official province, all ministers and assistant ministers during the election period. 18. The Government usually selects the candidates at an election, as there are no political parties in the commonly accepted sense of the words. Sometimes candidates volunteer themselves when they see they have hopes of winning. There is no condition of previous residence, but, as mentioned above, the candidate must be generally known in his electoral area.28 19 No deposit of money is required from a candidate; and he may spend any amount of money on his election campaign. Candidates some- times travel themselves to their constituencies and make speeches or issi* notfces showing their own worth and suitability ; more often the electorate t nursed by the candidates’ friends, by “ rozeh-khwans or religious | preachers ; by influential notables and landowners. 20 The Deputies are all elected from particular areas of Persia, except the following four : Two Armenian Deputies, one from Azerbaijan and the other from the rest of Persia; one Zorastnan and one Jew. These four Deputies are elected only by persons of the racial group concerned, i.e., by Armenian, Zorastrians or Jews respectively. 21 If the Government requires an elected Deputy to serve in a Govern ment appointment, he must resign his member hip of the Majlis three months before taking up his Government appointment. 22 The distribution of the 136 Deputies is laid down in the Electoral Law It has formed the subject of some criticisms on the ground that it is not in conformity with the distribution of population ; for instance, the Province of Azerbaijan sends nineteen Deputies to the Majlis, whereas the provinces of Khorassan and Seistan together send only hi teen. 23. Deputies of the Majlis receive a salary of 300 tomans a month (about £660 per annum), which forms a considerable inducement to become a Deputy In order to earn this salary, however, the Deputy is obliged to attend all the sittings of the Majlis, unless he receives special leave of absence, granted by a permanent “ leave committee of the Majlis and confirmed by the Majlii itself in plenary session. Should the Deputy absent himself without permission, a proportionate amount of his salary is deducted frvr paoh absence. .. .i Appendix to Enclosure.

G. for a large amount of Rifle Machine Gun Ammunition. Our London House is very interested in this matter because, as you know one of their firms, Messrs. Kynoch Limited, are cartridge manufacturers and if you could let us have any news about this matter, we should be extremely indebted to you.” In reply to my enquiry regarding the Brunner Waffenworks I have today received the following information :— “ I have heard that the facts are as stated. I am told that 100,000 rifles and 3,000 machine guns were actually ordered. I am told that negotiations were carried on by a Persian Prince personally. After they had gone on for a considerable time they were sudden ly broken off and the Prince was recalled. But he returned a short time a^o and the contract was then finally concluded. The Prince is alleged to have stated that the payment for their transaction is financed from England on behalf of an English Oil Company which has its wells near the Russian frontier and desires to ensure their safety in thus providing the Persian Army with arms. It was on account of this fact, viz., that an English company is supposed to be at the back of the affair that I meant to write to you. My opinion was that if really English money was going to be spent it should employ British and not con tinental firms. I am told that the Waffenworks will be occupied for a period of two years with this order.” I am still awaiting a reply on the subject of the ammunition referred to.

Mon cher Minister, I hasten to acknowledge receipt of Your Excellency's letter dated the ^10th on the subject of an incident w'hich is said to have occurred when the sloop “ Crocus ” put into port at Bandar Abbas recently. 2. I did not fail to wire immediately after our conversation to the British Consul in this port asking him to furnish me with the necessary particulars. He replied that so far as he knows no such incident has happened. 3. It does not appear to me to be altogether impossible that the commander might have fired a salvo on arriving at Bandar Abbas as he was accustomed to at Bushire, and I shall remind him of the regulations in force upon the subject. If this is so, I regret that the misunderstanding has risen, but I do not really see any reason one could have to call the incident a gesture of international courtesy, even though it might be misplaced. It may have been, and this appears very probable, that the salvo was fired, in accordance with the custom in the British navy, as a salute to the Consul who was just coming off the “ Crocus ” to take up his post. Please accept, mon cher Ministre, my very highest regards. R. H. CLIVE. H. E. Mirza Mohammad Ali Khan Farzin, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Tehran. (24) E 692/692/34.

Since writing my despatch No. 353 of the 29th June (Serial No. 97 in file No 17-N./29), I have discussed the matter of the arrangement of the A.ffn*rs of the Sheikh of Mohammerah on one or t\yo occasions with Tevmourtache, and, at an interview in December last His Highness again expressed the opinion that a form of arbitration would be the best means of arranging this matter. I accordingly sent a communication m that sense to the Sheikh who accepted the proposal in principle, expresbing at t gam*' 0 time the hope that, as a basis for arbitration, the Government would consent “o take either the proposals made in the summer of 1927 by Teymourtache himself or the letter wntten by Dr. Mdlspaugh in 1926. o j informed Teymourtache of the Sheikh’s reply in a letter dated the 6th December, but I have not received any answer from him.

A few days later news arrived that a detachment of about 250 troops were besieged at Husainabad on the Pushti-Kuh frontier, and that the Mili tary Governor of Pushti-Kuh, General Salar Nizam, was with his force besieged at Deh Bala. Jhe customs posts in Pushti-Kuh were closed down, and the personnel beaten and expelled. 4. To meet what seemed to be a serious menace the Persian authorities had a handful of seasoned troops under Colonel Bagher Khan at Shahabad and 400-500 raw recruits in Kermanshah or the neighbourhood, including a detachment of recruits despatched for training to Isfahan, who were re called from Bisitun. There was also a lack of competent regimental offi cers. The most capable officer, Major Haji Ali Khan, who alone seems able to handle recruits, had left to get married in Tehran, whence he w T as recalled the day before his wedding. Transport was commandeered and all available troops were rushed out to Shahahad, but the military authorities wisely enlisted the aid of the Kalhur tribe, who bore the brunt of the fight ing. An important factor was the assistance of two aeroplanes, a mono plane and a biplane, the pilot of the latter being a German. This machine made several trips to the scene of the operations, and bombed the rebels, the Chief of Staff himself dropping the bombs. At least a day was lost by lack of maps at headquarters here, and the staff applied to me for the loan of maps which I gave them. The Kalhurs are reported to have fought well, and the. whole outbreak was crushed in about ten days. I have been unable to ascertain casualties. 5. The rising appears to have been organised by Ali Kuli Khan, a son of the Vali, who is usually on bad terms with his father. Whether the Vali and his other sons had any hand in instigating it is at present unknown. Responsible authorities here profess to believe that they had not. There is, however, a belief, which I know to be well founded, that a much larger tribal rising was intended, which might ultimately have spread all over Kurdistan. It was intended that the Kalkhanis and Gurans should rise, and they would ha\e been supported by the \\ aladbegi and Babajani tribes, with whom they have a secret alliance. Such a rising would have been serious, but was pre vented by the prompt action of Colonel Bagher Khan, who at once arrested lath All Sultan Kalkhani, and held him as a hostage for the 'ood beha viour of his tribe. This had the effect of keeping the Kalkhanis quiet until it was too late for their intervention to be effective. Copies of this despatch are being sent to his Excellency the High Com missioner, Baghdad, and His Majesty’s vice-consul at Hamadan. Letter from H.

Opening of new prison in Tehran. Despatch feo.i H.

The followingday the foreign representatives and members of their staffs were invited to see the new prison. 2. Jasr-i-Qajar is the name of the palace built by Nasr-ed-dm Shah on ^ a picturesque eminence lying about half way between Tehran and the sum mer resort of Shimran. It is beautifully situated with an extensive view over the plain to the south. The palace has not been occupied for a num ber of years, and when the capitulations were abolished eighteen months ago it wms decided to construct a new model prison in the grounds. 1 here can be few prisons in this world built in such beautiful surroundings. On arrival at the prison grounds we were received by the Minister of Court with whom were the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Justice and Inte rior and the new Chief of Police, General Sadiq Khan Koupal (Saiar-Nizam). It transpired that, on the day before, on the occasion of His Majesty’s visit, the beds of the sentries had, hy an oversight, been left outside. His Majesty summoned General Mahomed' Khan Hargahi, the Chief of Police, abused him vehemently before the assembled company and told him he was dis missed. I had the honour to report this in my telegram No. of Decem ber 3rd. 4. The Minister of Court, who with the new Chief of Police did the honours of showing the foreign representatives round the prison, was in his most gay and genial mood, which can no doubt in part be attributed to the sudden dismissal of his old enemy General Mahomed Khan, though the genuine astonishment of the foreign representatives at the new model prison must have been equally pleasing to him. I he prison has been built to accom modate 600 male and 200 female prisoners. Monsieur Markoff, the Russian architect who designed it, told me that it was based on the latest plans diawn up by the International Prison Committee (a body of whose existence I am ashamed to say I was till then unaware). The corridors are all light and airy as are the cells, all of which were carpeted. The cells for prisoners convicted of misdemeanours had accommodation for 5 people and the prison ers were supplied with a good mattress and blanket. There were a num ber of cells to hold onlv one prisoner convicted of more serious crimes but these were of adequate size, and for some reason which was not clear to me, were supplied with a bedstead instead of with a simple mattress There were numerous courtyards in which the prisoners could exercise there was a hospital ward and a pharmacy, an operating room and large well-equippe bathrooms. I asked the Minister of Court if I could be supplied with a plan of the prison, and this he promised to have sent me. It would certainly be impossible to complain, in the event of any British subject being sentenced to serve a term in this prison, that the accommodation as seen yesterday could in any way be complained of. 5. I asked Monsieur Markoff what had been the cost of the building. He said 195.000 Tomans (say £39,000), while the installation e ^c ric heating which was being arranged for would cost an additional 60,0 Tomans. The total cost would therefore be about £50,000. 6.

No. 606 of 14th December, 1029. Tehran police.Despatch from H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 606, dated December 15th, 1929. With reference to my telegram No. 365 of December 3rd (S. No. 150 of File No. 17-N.), and in continuation of my despatch No. 600 of December 4th, regarding the dismissal of General Mohammad Khan Dargahi from the command of the Police Force, I have the honour to state that the day following that on which the Chief of Police was dismissed, the Shah gave instructions that he was to be confined in the lockup of the Military Police. At the same time some four of his immediate police subordinates were arrested and confined there too. 2. It appears that on the evening of the day of the dismissal, the Shah received news that Dost Mohammad had arrived in the province of Kerman and that he and his men had had a brush with some military in which the latter had suffered slight losses. His Majesty at once ordered his car and went down to the central Police station where he arrived about midnight. From there he telephoned to General Dargahi to come immediately but°the latter pleaded illness and said he was unable to obey. The Shah then tele phoned to one or two other military officers who were not at home and finally found General Salar Nizam who came hastily to the Police station where he was ordered to take charge of affairs. 3. There would seem to be little doubt that the escape of Dost Moham mad was largely responsible for the arrest of the Chief of Police but his subordinates could hardly be blamed for this. For some time past the Tehran public have not been pleased with the present police methods and Dargahi’s dismissal is a cause of joy to many. In the course of the police investigation into the murder of the woman, which I reported in my des patch No. 582 of November 28th, a serious miscarriage of justice was very nearly committed, as the Police, by methods of torture, had succeeded in wringing a confession from a man who was entirely innocent of the deed. hen the reai murderer was found the public were horrified to discover that such methods were possible. The Shah may therefore have decided that a change in the higher posts of the administration was in any case 4. Dargahi, after a week’s confinement, was liberated on the 11th in stant hut was degraded from the rank of General to that of Colonel. It is too early yet to speculate on his chances of re-instatement. He has been in charge of the Police administration ever since the departure of the Swede, General Westdahl, and, generally speaking, has carried out his task efficient ly. He has built up an intelligence service which functions, it would appear, extremely well and the Shah was in the habit of trusting to the full the in formation which his Chief of Police produced. This, in the opinion of many, rendered Dargahi almost indispensable to His Majesty. Personality plays a preponderant role in all matters Persian and Dargahi had himself built up and manned this service. It may be surmised therefore that the personnel is faithful to him and may find the control of a new Chief irksome, with the consequent result that the Shah’s news will not be as efficiently serv ed up as formerly. 5. In the meantime General Salar Nizam has been confirmed in his new post but it is considered to be only a temporary employment. Were the Shah to reinstate Dargahi it would be only one more repetition of his well- known methods of reminding powerful subordinates that he is the master of theit fnte. It may be expected, however, that all Teymourtache’s in fluence will be used to keep Dargahi out of favour as long as possible. 6.

M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 586, dated 28th November 1929. In my despatch No. 554 Confidential of November 9th (Enclo. of S. No. 142 in file No. 17-N), I had the honour to refer to the difficulties which had arisen between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the newly formed Persian Security Police in Abadan and Mohammerah. 2. You will recollect that at my audience with the Shah at the end of August I spoke to His Majesty on the subject of this new police force but rather in connection with their relations with His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah. 3. At an interview which I had with the Minister of Court on Novem ber 15th, when telling His Highness about my recent visit to Abadan, I mentioned the question of the Persian Security Police and the suspicious attitude which they appeared to adopt, not only towards His Majesty’s Con sulate, but also towards the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. I found that His Highness was fully informed on the subject. He ascribed the unsatis factory state of affairs which had arisen mainly to the friction which existed between Bah rami, the head of the Persian Security Police, and Arfa-es- Sultaneh, who, for several years past had been the chief Persian agent in the Oil Company s intelligence service. From the experience which he had gain ed, in the past as a provincial governor he spoke with some feeling on the subject of police in general and Security Police in particular and said that the latter were always inclined to invent bogies to justify their existence. He said that it was inevitable that there should be jealousy between these two intelligence services in Abadan and that the only solution was a Persian Government service working in close harmony and co-ooeration with the Oil Company. 4. At His Highness’ request I telegraphed to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz a message to Mr. Jacks, Resident Director of the Oil Company. I had the honour to repeat this telegram to you in my telegram No. 360 of November 16th, as I considered that you might think it advisable to inform Sir John Cadman of what the Minister of Court had said to me. 5. I have now the honour to enclose a copy of a telegram in reply from 'J ac ^ s an d of a letter which I have sent to Teymourtache on the basis of this telegram. 61 think that His Highness fully realises that if the Persian Security Police do not establish friendly and intimate relations with the Company, the latter will be bound to take such precautionary measures as they think k ee P themselves fully informed of the feeling among their 'workmen at Abadan and at the oilfields, as well as in the province in general. 7.

Political situation. . of 1 State Tor .Foreign Affairs.8 Despatch from H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 16, dated January 9th, 1930. It may be of interest at the beginning of a New Year to take stock of the internal position in Persia as it appears to me to-day and of the trend of Persian policy towards foreign Powers and foreigners in general and ^ towards Great Britain in particular. 2. To a casual observer such as an itinerant journalist writing up Persia, it might appear that this country is on an upward wave of pro sperity. So far as outward appearances go there is something to be said for this. A great railway scheme is on foot, the first sections in the north and south are on the verge of completion, the general state of the roads has enormously improved in the past three years, road transport has, under the impetus of a duty-free import of motor cars, temporarily attained such pro portions that rates have been cut so as to leave little, if any, margin of profit. In Tehran and the provincial capitals grandiose' municipal schemes are being undertaken to widen streets, erect further buildings, instal electric light and so forth. The new Persian dress is uniform and neat. The wave of tribal unrest which threatened in the summer to sweep over the country, has subsided. Security is re-established. The Shah is again all-powerful. So much for outward appearances. 3. There is however, as always, another side of the medal. In May 1928 the Minister of Court confidently hoped within a year to conclude new treaties with all the Powers represented in Tehran whose former treaties had been denounced. No treaties have, however, yet been concluded with the Americans, French, Italians, Dutch or with ourselves. His Majesty’s Government are, however, in a much stronger position than the other Powers as they have on the one hand the Tariff Autonomy Treaty of May 10, 1928, and on the other the old Treaty of 1857 with its Most Favoured Nation clause. Monsieur Wilden, the French Minister who leaves this week, had hoped to conclude his treaties before leaving. Instead of this he finds that the Minister of Court has gone back on half the articles of the Commercial Treaty which had been agreed between them. He maintains that His High ness is becoming more and more obstructive, so much so that he seriously contemplates advising his Government to delay indefinitely the departure of the new French Minister. 4. How far the complete failure of the Turco-Persian Frontier Com mission to come to any agreement this autumn ia due to the Turks or to the Persians I am unable to say. All I know is that the Turkish Ambassador— as is perhaps to be expected—ascribes the failure entirely to the obstructive and unreasonable attitude of the Persians. 5. My German Colleague, who has been here six years, says he feels worn out by Persian obstructiveness and longs to get away. He has had endless difficulties in connection with the work done by the German section of the Railway Syndicate. The German engineers are packing up to go home except the few required for the completion of the short section from Sari— Aliabad. He is entirely pessimistic of the future of the railway. Dr. Schniewind. the German financial adviser, counts the days to the end of his contract. On no single point, I understand, have the Persians ever taken his advice. 6. Dr. Walder, the Swiss Treasurer General, resigned in December and has been succeeded temporarily by Monsieur Dekerokheer, the Belgian Head of the Customs. Monsieur Dekerokheer already realises that he can do nothing at all and has begged the Minister of Court to relieve him of what he considers a hopeless task and let him return to his Customs. 7. Three other advisers or experts in the service of the Persian Govern ment are equally in despair. Monsieur Godard, the Director of the non existent Persian Museum, although paid his salary, feels he might as well not be here, as he has no funds at his disposal and no Persian takes thesmallest interest in his work. Monsieur Nevou Lemaire, whose expert advice has been enlisted for the founding of an up to date hospital in Tehran and other matters in connection with public health, realises that nobody wants his advice or has any intention of taking it. Finally, Monsieur Vassenhove, the Head of the Havas Agency in Vienna, who came here a year ago at the special request of Teymourtache to inaugurate a Persian telegraphic news agency, is leaving to-morrow, having accomplished absolutely nothing. He told me that he had submitted various schemes all of which were politely re ceived and equally politely pigeon-holed. I asked him if his impression of the progress of the last few years was that it was- merely superficial. He said he almost feared this was so, and that a return in certain eventualities to the prewar chaos could not be excluded as altogether impossible As the leopard cannot change its spots, so the Persians are eo-day as in the past the same pleasant and plausible liars, filled with good intentions, but lacking the moral dualities to carry them out even if they have the will, which is doubtful. It may indeed be asked why the Persian Government should go to the expense of engaging experts to advise and assist them when they have no intention of availing themselves of their services. 8. From the above one is led to conclude that the wave of optimism which seemed to be sweeping over Persia in 1927 had, in 1929, already begun to recede. But beyond the eternal fickleness of the Persian character are there not other reasons to account for this? 9. During 1927 and 1928 three men, all of considerable ability, dominat ed the situation. Teymourtache, the Minister of Court, Daver, the Minister of Justice and Firuz Mirza, the Minister of Finance. This trmmverate, working under the orders of His Majesty, was all-powerml, the rest of the Cabinet including the Prime Minister, the merest nonentities. And of this triumverate Teymourtache was the outstanding personality, a sort of Persian superman who' appeared to be intellectually and morally superior to his countrvmen, a man who, having had his ups and downs m the past, had now settled down as the outstanding statesman of his country enjoying the fu confidence of his Imperial Master. 10 Political power is apt to be short lived in all countries. In an Oriental country with an autocratic sovereign the fortunes of the politician aVe even more precarious. No one, therefore, was really surprised, and most Persians were frankly delighted when last June ““‘dicftaTlacfthe oflicial salaam the Shah suddenly ordered the Chief of 1 Minister of Finance under arrest. To-day, seven months later, Prince L miz fs still confined to his house, and it may be added that the long powerful and favoured Chief of Police has since been summarily dismissed. 11 Many reasons have been advanced to account for the arrest of F |ru Z' Mv own impression although I have no definite proof is that the Shah who at'that moment was very seriously alarmed by what threatened to becol,le y s„r, ™» s .&lt; vr Kuiir^Prince^^kbar Mirza, his cousin the Governor General °f Fars, ^ -y y'iv’tt wars wsrstSifis* A younger peine‘of the Per.i.n Gove— living in exile at Hwta a &amp; P. tart&gt; wag thought tc be showing who had never acknowledged th Pahl ^ of Gol , rt , doubtless under signs of unrest.

It as . V ,.f t he Kajars, I equally believe there were no dynastic movement M . a i ar m. The result however of the arrest grounds H ls f f r a ^ h „g First and foremost it broke up the WoSSk i“oh” .« .oh o hflf h.d h»« .11 nowerfol. Socondly.10 the confidence of His Majesty in his Minister of Court was shaken. Tey- mourtache was Firuz’ most intimate friend. Teymourtache had enemies who seized the opportunity to play on His Majesty’s suspicions, and although the Minister of Court still remains in his old position and is still the most influential man in the country after the Shah, no one pretends that his position is what it was before the arrest of Prince Firuz. Moreover he would appear to have lost some of his former energy. He is tired and would he glad to have a rest The result is—and all my colleagues make the same complaint—that it is now as difficult as ever it was to extract an answer from the Persian Government on any question or to get the smallest matter settled. The present Minister of Foreign Affairs is a pastmaster of prevarication and indecision whose only principle is never to do to-day what can be postponed till the morrow. The President of the Council, now an old man, makes no pretence of interest in anything but his daily pill of opium and his monthly salary. 13. There are, however, other factors to belie the possible illusions of the casual observer. The heavy fall in the price of silver, a big deficit in the year’s budget, the scandal arising from the disappearance of government grain to a value of nearly one million tomans, the loss of face involved, if, as now seems probable, the great trunk railway project will have to be in definitely postponed, although in so far as this may be due to a fall during the past year of twenty-five per cent, in the value of the Kran, the latter factor may well be a blessing in disguise. 14. As regards British interests in particular I do not consider that we have special cause for dissatisfaction. The Imperial Bank is unques tionably holding its own against the National Bank, whose future is still far from assured. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company having survived the Soviet engineered attack of kist summer, is in my opinion in one important particular the stronger in consequence, in that the Persian Government realise that they have too much to lose by an attack on the Company’s pro sperity, or a diminution in the latter’s output of oil. Whether it will be possible to conclude a new agreement this year with the Persian Govern ment on the lines initiated last spring by Sir John Cadman remains to be seen. Provided the Persians can be induced to be reasonable, a new agree ment would obviously be to the advantage of the Company. In spite of the refusal of the Persian Government to recognise the prolongation of the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s concession, the Telegraph Depart ment has continued throughout the year to function as usual. Complaints from British subjects have not been excessive, and while the lorries of British transport concerns have frequently been requisitioned in the most arbitrary way, there has certainly been no anti-British discrimination and other foreign owned transport has frequently been as badly and often worse treated. 15. The stories of British assistance to the tribes which were circulated during the summer, were nowhere seriously believed, and it would be an exaggeration to talk of an anti-British movement. In so far as Soviet Con suls and Agents may have disseminated these stories, and we know that they did so, it should be added that from the time when it became clear that diplomatic relations with the Soviet Government would be resumed, this anti-British propaganda has largely ceased. 16. Finally, I am convinced that the Shah does genuinely desire to see Anglo-Persian relations placed on a firm basis of mutual friendship and esteem and to that end is anxious that the treaties under discussion should be concluded as soon as possible. 17. It may perhaps be argued from what I have said earlier in this des patch that we have no need to hurry, that at any rate during the past year we have lost nothing by not having yet concluded new treaties, that no real progress has been made in Persia in 1929, and that there are even signs of deterioration.18. To that I would reply by asking, “Have we anything to lose by ii&amp;aking new treaties? Are we sacrificing anything that we could be sure of maintaining if we made no treaties?’’ 19. Apart from the debt, payment of which by the Persian Government has always appeared to me more than problematical, I venture to think we are sacrificing nothing by coming to terms with Persia to-day even to the extent of regularising our position in the Persian Gulf. To transter the centre of our activities in tfie Gulf from the inhospitable Persian coast would seem to me to present no disadvantages if thereby we acquire what we want in Hen jam and put an end to the tiresome if ineffectual Persian claim to Bahrein, more especially when it is clear that the Persian Government have it in their power to make difficulties for the visits of British warships to Persian ports, and in many other ways, by a policy of pinpricks to cause un annoyance. 20 The Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 and the abortive treaty associated with th^ names of the late Marquess Curzon and Sir Percy Cox still recall bitter memories in the minds of too many Persians. To establish our relations to-day on a basis of complete equality and recipro city, even if Persia * superficially progressive, is in reality as weak as ever can but help to dim the memory of the past and prove to Persia and to the Moslem world that His Majesty’s Government is determined to show her sympathy wdth the Pahlevi dynasty and the aspirations of the Persian .people. „ T i• 21.

(Received on 27th July 1930, with Political Secretary's letter No. 28, dated the 10th July 1930). Confidential despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, Gulhek, No. 259, dated the 14th June 1930. My American colleague in the course of a visit be paid me this morning gave me the following information which is not without interest. He begged me how ever to treat it in absolete confidence. A certain Mr. D xon, or it may be Dickson, representing an American oil development company, was recently in Tehran when he had an interview with the Minister of Court. He hoped to obtain from the Persian Government a concession for the working of oil in the Northern provinces of Persia. Mr. Dixon was himself a geologist and had most detailed information about the oil-bearing properties in question—obtained possibly from the former Sinclair Oil Company and/or from Mr. C app, the American oil geologist who came to Persia on behalf of the Persian Government in 1927. In the course of this interview Teymourtache said to Mr. Dickson that the official life of politicians in Persia was precarious and they had to make provision for the future. Mr. Dickson took the hint and the sum of fifty thousand dollars was agreed upon as a suitable “ advance payment ’ if the concession went through. Mr. Dickson informed my American colleague of this conversation, and the latter immediately te’egraphed to Washington with the result that the United States Government requested the Oil Company to recall Mr. Dixon and to drop the idea of obtaining the concession. Mr. Dixon was at once told to leave Persia by his Company. Mr. Hart holds very decided views about concessions in Persia and considers that the best thing for Americans to do is to leave Persia alone altogether. I understood from him that the State Department shares this \ iew. (80) Memorandum from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 112, dated the 11th July 1930.

The Chief Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia has been so good as to fur nish me with the Customs estimate, based on telegraphic reports, of the total value of Persian imports and exports during the year 1308, ended March 20, 1930. The following table offers a comparison of these figures with those of the previous year, as submitted in my Annual Report for 1927-30 now in the press. In krans and sterling. 1307 (1928-29) 1308 (1929-30) Increase Decrease. Imports, Merchandise bullion and specie .. 819,865,455 £17,059,861 915,000,000 £15,535,000 + 11-6 — 9-0 Exports. Oil 892,234,400 £18,575,608 865.000,000 £14,686,000 — 30 —20-9 Other than oil 480,053,692 £9,994,872 485,000,000 £8,234,000 + 10 —17-6 rates of conversion:— .. 1928-29 £1 equals 48’ 03 krans 1929-30 £1 equals 58'90 „ 2. It will be seen that, measured in sterling, there has been a general falling off in the value of both imports and exports. Trade in 1929-30, moreover, can be said to have been carried out on particularly unfavourable lines, owing to a depreciated currency and low purchasing power where imports were concerned, while the slump in the world price of commodities naturally reacted on the export business. I have dealt with these questions at some length in my Annual Report. 3. Mr. Wilkinson works out the balance of trade for last year as follows Imports .. Exports .. Oil Krans. .. 915,000,000 .. 1.350,000,000 .. 865,000,000 485,000,000 . ^ ^ ... ... .. 60,000,000 -f A. P. O. C. cash expenditure 545,000,000 4 This represents an adverse balance of 470,000,000 krans which Mr. Wilkinson thinks can be reduced to 200,000,000 krans “ as the figures are approximate only” Why he should think so I fail to understand as long, that is, as the oil royalty, which the Persian Government insist on withdrawing from the trade balance by investing the money in Europe, is kept out of calculation It is tine that le cash expenditure of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, according to the Resident l)irector P can safely be put at 90 , 000,000 krans (£li million) but on the other hand the value of goods smuggled into the country on so generous a scale is usually sai to be largely in excess of the value of the goods smuggled out of the country. MC445FD5. But whatever the figures, the passive trade balance for last year was „„ doubtedly a serious one, as is only too evident from the difficulties now bein'., IT perienced by the exchange controllers-and of course the importers themselve! m their eftorts to liquidate past engagements. ^es— r 6 ' » thi ® d f s P^ is bein ? sent ^ the Secretary to the Government of India and His Majesty s High Commissioner for Iraq. ^ (82) Memo, from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 1930. 116, DATED THE 12TH JULY His Britannic Majesty a Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the sub! ject of Junkers Air Service m Persia. - Despatch to the Foreign Office No, 325 of July 12th, 1930.

His Britannic Majesty’s Bepresentative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule, on the sub ject of Activities and Expenditure of the Persian Government on News Services and propaganda:— Despatch to the Foreign Office, No. 330 (Confidential), dated the 14th July 1930. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 330, dated the 14th July 1930. With reference to your Circular despatch ot June 24th {P. 1216/1134/150), I have the honour to enclose a memorandum by the Oriental Secretary regarding the expenditure on propagandist activities by the Persian Government of funds voted for the purpose by the Persian Parliament. 2. In future a paragraph relating to this matter will be included in the annual report. 3. A copy of this despatch, with its enclosures, has been sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. MEMORANDUM. During the year 1928 the Majlis, at the request of the Persian Government, voted a small credit for propaganda purposes ; this expenditure was controlled by the Court and a small amount of this sum was paid to the Habl-ul-Matinof Calcutta. In the budget for 1929-30 a sum of Tomans forty-five thousand was voted for propaganda and in the Budget for 1930-31 the credit was fixed at Tomans fifteen thousand. The whole of this expenditure is controlled by the Court, the money is spent secretly and no accounts are published. The local Press probably receives doles from time to time and doubtless the expenses incurred by the Havas agency re presentative during his yenr’s stay in Tehran were met from this source. The two foreign newspapers commonly supposed to receive subsidies from the Persian Government are the Habl-ul-Matiii of Calcutta and the Chehreh Nema of Cairo, the Editor of the latter is at present in Tehran and was recently received in audience by the Shah. The Habl-ul-Matin does propaganda in favour of Persia but at rare intervals it takes Persia to task and an open letter will appear addressed to the Shah com plaining of administrative abuses or of the lack of freedom in the Majlis elections. Such copies are usually confiscated in the Persian Post Offices. It js doubtful whether the Persian Government obtains value for its money from this paper and with the exception of a rare article in the Chehreh Nema there is no evidence of any sustained Persian propaganda in the foreign press.

His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign ^ Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule on the subject of public works—sugar factory:— Mr. Lingeman’s despatch No. Overseas Trade (B.) 91 of July 14, 1930, to the Department of Overseas Trade. Copies to :— The Foreign Office under Printed Letter No. 331, His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq under Printed Letter No. 108, dated July 14, 1930. Despatch from the Officer in Charge of Commercial Affairs, His Majesty’s Legation, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. Overseas Trade (B) 91, dated the 14th July 1930. The Minister of National Economics has been repeatedly asked in the Majlies to state what he has done, since his Ministry was created in April last, to hasten the construction of blast furnaces, sugar, cement, glass, paper and textile factories ; the exploitation of the country’s mineral w r ealtli ; and the development of new oil fields, not excluding up to date refineries! Feroughi was eventually stung into replying that factories could not be expected to grow like mushrooms overnight and that he refused to commit the Government to any extraordinary expenditure on account of works of public utility except after profound study, and only when he had himself acquired the conviction that such expenditure was justified. 2. It has long been known that the Government were particularly interested in the possibility of replacing the substantial imports of sugar, valued at over £2 million in 1928-29, by sugar locally grown and refined. The Minister of Court discoursed to me at great length and in a most enthusiastic vein on this subject some months ago, I pointed out {a) that the Persian cost of manufacture would certainly exceed the price at which the Russians would be willing to sell—that being undoubtedly the reason for the failure of the Belgian sugar factory at Kerizak a number of years ago, as it also accounted for the recent closure of the Tabriz, match factory—and (b) that if the Persian Government decided to raise the mono poly tax on foreign sugar in order to make things more difficult for the Russians or even decided to restrict imports to a given quantity, the Soviet Government might well look on such a step as a declaration of economic warfare, from which I feared that Persia might come off second best. (Teimourtache also referred con fidentially in this conversation to his plans for the institution of a state monopoly for the distribution of oil products which would hardly fail to irritate the Russians.) I begged His Highness to remember that the smaller the Russian sales to Persia— at what have been extremely pxlvantageous terms till quite recently—the smaller their purchases would tend to become. In the last resort the Soviet Government ^ght the length of declaring another embargo on Persian imports, as they had done in 1926 with disastrous effects on the economy of Persia’s nothern pro vinces. Teimourtache professed not to feel the least anxiety on this account. The Russians, he said, would always have to buy certain Persian products such as cotton and wool—which is by no means proven:—while alternative outlets could be found for the remainder. I did not think it politic to disparage the potentialities of the Duzdap railway and Rawanduz route for such low r grade products as Persia has to export but enquired of His Highness whether he thought the rice of Gilan and Mazanderan would stand the enormous transport charges to any other sea than the Caspian. Teimourtache stated that he had no such illusion : it was quite simple in his view, in the event of Russia refusing to buy Persian rice, to tell the growers of Gilan and Mazanderan to produce only as much rice as was required for home consumption and pay greater attention to other crops. (The exports of rice to Russia in 1928-29 were valued at £600,000.) I took it upon myself to suggest that it might be advisable for Persia to free herself from her present depen dence on the Russian market before indulging in economic hostilities wdth theargument'an'yTurther' 1 * forCT,d t0 Ceal^Zi, thflt il was Powtlesa to pursue the sz ■* is.*? “H **, ««*• p«c jj/srasa siss^oass: m one of her articles on present day Persia, as the “ foreign sterling ” is not to be had, and that is probably why the contract has not actually been signed as yet 2“f ,X”.T'“ 0&lt; ,l “ P *™“ treasury the «hL, ur.y^fK, 4 ; A llaVe ^ e . e . n told b 7 an official of the Ministry of National Economics that one of the conditions of the contract is that the Czechoslovakian company con cerned !S bound to take shares in the company which is to operate the^unar factory, the balance of the shares being presumably held by the Government. g ft seems evident therefore that the latter propose to adhere to this method of in teresting foreign capital in Persian economic development. 5. This Czechoslovakian company, which is said to have equipped two sugar factories in Great Britain, sent an expert to Persia some time ago to experiment '7 th v ?^ 1 , 0 A u I t ^ peS °{f u ^ ar beet and su g ar ca he. Mr. Schubert, the Czechoslovakian Charge d Aftaires, tells me that the experiments with sugar beet made in the Kerej Va j i W6re extraordinaril y successful. Whereas the beet in Central Europe ave raged between 400 and 500 grammes, Kerej produced beet weighing 950 grammes, Ihe sugar content was also very high : 21% as opposed to 17-18% in Europe, I understood Mr, Schubert to say, This, however, need not prevent the Russians from undercutting the product of the new factory if given a chance of doing so. 6. Of the other projects which the Ministry of National Economics is earnestly studying, the most discussed are the cultivation of cane sugar and its manufactuie in Khuzistan, in virtue of an agreement with this sanie Czechoslovakian company ; a cement factory which is to make it possible for the Tehran Municipality to con struct proper streets ; and a jnodel carpet factory intended to help renovate “ bait du beau tapis persan 7. I have been told, with regard to the last of these, that the carpet section of tne Ministry turned down with scorn the suggestion that some perfectly suitable government warehouses should be taken over to house the looms, etc. It insisted on putting up new buildings at a cost of £10,000 “ as the money was avail able . A far more scandalous example of waste in government expenditure, in spite of the present financial crisis, is afforded by the opening of a credit of close on £71,000 to complete the road to the Shamshak coal mine. I am addressing a separate despatch to you on this subject. 8. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Foreign Office, the Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq. (86) Memo, prom His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 121, dated the 15th July 1930. His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-joined Schedule on the Subject of the situation in the Fars province:— To the Foreign Office, London, No. 332 of 15th July 1930. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the-Foreign Office, London, No. 332, dated the 15th July 1930. I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of a despatch received from the acting Consul at Shiraz with regard to events in the province of Fars andto military operations which the Persian Government is preparing to take against the Boir Ahmedi section of the Kuhgelu tribe. 2 The outbreak in Lar is for the moment on a small scale and may be re garded as a recrudescence of a part of the troubles of last year. If the Persian Government dispose of sufficient forces the outbreak should not be serious, but in view of the concentration of Government troops around the Mamasenm country for operations against the Boir Ahmedi. the Government may find difficulty in despatching at once a sufficient force to quell the disorder. 1 he fact that Mirza Ibrahim Khan Qawam was allowed to leave Shira vfor Tehran at a moment when his influence might have been utilised in a district where he is so well-known seems to point to the fact that for the moment too much importance need not be attached to events around Lar. 3 The subiucation of the Boir Ahmedi is a far more difficult question and the fact that the General Officer Commanding the South is concentrating a force of some five thousand regular troops points to the fact that he is not embarking on the affair in a light hearted manner. In the winter of 1928--.) the Persian Government sent forces against the Boir Ahmedis m the Mamasenm district but they did not achieve their purpose and Government prestige is not high with these tribesmen. I am informed that Bakhtiari irregulars will also be employed in these operations and that regular troops will also march towards Mamasenm from the direction of Behbehan. If events elsewhere are not allowed to distract t he atten tion of the Persian Government and the extreme heat does not interfere with those operations there is a hope that this time the Persian Government will settle this question once and for all. At the end of June a force of some three hundred Boir Ahmedis looted a test camp of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company some thirty-two miles south-east of Behbehan afterwards returning to their headquarters The country where operations will take place is very wild and rugged and the tribes alone know the intricate passes which lead to their strongholds , the Persian Commander is therefore well-advised to leave nothing to chance and if negotiations with the tribes break down or come to nothing, to embark on the campaign on y after making the most thorough preparations and after concentrating m the various districts all the forces he can muster. India. A copy of this despatch, with enclosure, has been sent to the Government of Letter from His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, to His Majesty s Minister, Tehran, No. 25, dated the 9th July 1930. In continuation of my despatch No. 24 of the 2nd July 1930, on the subject of the situation in Fars province, I have the honour to inform you that the Amir Lashkar Habibullah Khan Shaibani left Shiraz on the afternoon of July 7th tor Ardakan to take charge of operations against the Mamassani tribes. 2. The Rizapur Regiment left Shiraz on July 4th, also for Ardakan, while the Pahlevi Regiment, a detachment (garden) of which had proceeded towards Ardakan on June 29th, had also moved out in the direction of Ardakan before the . mi Lashkar's departure. 3. The report in my telegram No. 6 of July 1st stating that the ^ e °!_ ment had gone via Kazarun to the Mamassani country was incorrect. tuallv proceeded via Ardakam The Amir Lashkar will therefore have ree en regiments, or 4,000—4,500 men, at his disposal for the campaign agam^ Mamassani. I have heard^however that he does not intend to take t ic o _ immediately, but that his plan is to remain in Ardakan, sending ou sma , in various directions and hoping that the Mamassani, duly rmpresse wi magnitude of the forces arrayed against them, will submit without much ngntn 0 . 4. According to the latest information received from Abadeh the Fauj-i-Ahan, which was, according to reports from Persia sources, coming down from J- with the intention of advancing from Abadeh towards Ardakan, has no there yet. You are perhaps in a position to ascertain whether this regime actually leave Tehran or not. Negotiations between the military authoritie the leaders of the Boir Ahmedi tribe are also still proceeding near Abadeh, du B oir Ahmedis are so far not inclined to submit and hand oi er their arms.97 Khan, the Saulat-ud-Daulah’s eldest son, left Shiraz on July 3rd to ioin the Oashoai tribes m their summer quaiters north-west of Abadeh. } y 8 qai to Tehran^y^ 111 Ul MUlk IS lea ' mg Shllaz to-morrow, July 10th, and returning &lt;&gt;.

The leader of the insurgents is Zahdan Khan, called/ad Khan m the Persian Official Almanac (Salnameh-i-Rasmi-i-Hamlikati) for 30!) who last year occupied Lar and, when he was driven out by the advance of the Persian troops who had defeated the Beharlu rebels near Darab, for a long time held out m his hereditary castle of Gerash. ° 7, Copies of this despatch are being sent to :— His Majesty s Consular Officers at Bushire, Isfahan, Ahwaz and Kerman. (87) Memo, fhom His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 124, dated the 15th July 1930. His Britannic Majesty’s Bepresentative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith of the document mentioned in the subjoined Schedule, on the subject of Perso- American relations:— To the Foreign Office, London, No. 338 of 15th Ju y 1930. Despatch from His Majesty's Minister, Tehran to the Foreign Office, London, No. 338, dated the 15th July 1930. With reference to my despatch No. 268 of June 16th [Enclosure of Serial No. (69)] on the subject of Perso-American relations, my American Colleague tells me that after receiving an ent rely unsatisfactory reply to the represen tations he had been instructed to make on the subject of his stolen property he had received a further telegram from the State Department couched in very st if language. He handed this second note ten days ago to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. In so doing he had requested that it should be brought to the notice of the Shah as being in the nature of a direct message from President Hoover to His Majesty. Foroughi, a most preaceable man who rather likes Americans than otherwise, had been extremely embarrassed. No reply had so far been sent but Mr. Hart had received word that an official of the Persian Foreign, Office would call on him to-day. 2. Mr. Hart told me that in his opinion a moment always arrived in dealing with Oriental Nations when it was essential to take an absolutely firm stand and refuse to budge from that position. That, he gave me to understand, was the attitude of the State Department to-day with regard to Persia. 3. I would add as a sign of the times that the paucity of Persians present at the American Minister’s official reception on July 4th in eomparson with pre vious years was generally remarked on, although it s true that the Prime Minister and the Minister of Court were both present. A copy of this despatch has been sent to the Government of India. (88) Endorsement from the Foreign and Political Department, No. F. 21-N./30, DATED THE 2ND AUGUST 1930.

With reference to my despatch No. 242 of the 3rd June regarding the general tension of Perso-Russian relations, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of three despatches from His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz regarding the sti alli ed situation on the Azerbaijan frontier, including not only the Perso-Russian fron tier, but that somewhat undefined region in the neighbourhood of Mount Ararat, where the Kurds have so often been a source of trouble. No mention of these events has been allowed to appear in the press, and I understand that the Persian Government are seriously concerned. 2. A telegram wh ch was sent by Mrs. McGrath (Rosita Forbes) on the 14th June to the “ Dai y Telegraph ” via India was, however, allowed by the Persian authorities to pass 3 This telegram of which the head of the Indo-European Telegraph Company kindly sent me a copy, contains nothing that is not covered by Mr. Pa.mer s des patches. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul Palmer to Sir R. Clive. (No. 96. Confidential). Tabriz, June 6th, 1930. I have the honour to transmit herewith a preliminary memorandum whic attempts to analyse the actual situation in the Caucasus, Turkish Armenia, an such Kurdish zones as lie within, or are contiguous to, the frontiers of Azerbaijan- * [ ] Not to Army Department.2. These three zones are, at the present moment, inextricably bound together by common interests or through temporarily successful outside intrigue. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Memorandum on the situation across the Northern and Western Front ers of Azerbai- jan. C aucasus. A serious attempt was made to organise a general revolution against t he ko oiet system, and the mainspring of the movement was in the North Caucasus— Baku and I )aghestan. The p an was to start the revolt in the North Caucasus—not in the south—and work progressively southwards till the River Araxes was reached. I his purely national movement, which I will call “A”, was almost, f not quite, independent of B , the Musavat movement fostered from Turkey. Several Tin kish officers entered the ( aucasus within the last few months upon propagandist missions and it is believed by many that the Aookly revolt (see below) may have been ed, or at least provoked, by such Turkish emissaries. The “ Musavat movement has apparently lost ground recently, and Cau casian Moslems are not at all inclined at present to favour annexation to Turkey ; but now only desire an independent Caucasian Republic. 2. The northern revolutionary group are alleged to have planned their rising for April. But the Soviets had already begun to enforce their system of nationalising land, crops and live-stock, and had for the first time believed themselves strong enough to apply this regime to the Mahomedans of the Caucasus. 3. One of the A ” leaders visited the Nakchevan district for .propagandist work ; but his visit had the unintended result that the loca impatience was fanned into premature flame, and three villages openly mutinied before the revo.t had started in the North Caucasus. 4. This quite upset the carefully-laid plans of the northern group and was suicidal for the villages concerned. They all lay close to, or within striking distance of, the Julfa-Tiflis Railway. Two armoured trains and troops were hurried down and the villages shelled out of existence. Some of the inhabitants, however, es caped to the hills to the north and, being armed, now constitute one of the many bands to which I propose to allude in some detail below. 5. The above inc dent seems to have exploded the mine ; but prematurely and in the wrong spot. The plan of a genera rising had gone wrong ; but it was too late to try and recast the whole scheme, as the warning had been given to the Soviets. Other districts then started to revolt at various intervals, instead of ad more or less according to definite plan ; and although there are at this moment probably between 20,000 and 30,000 armed rebels dotted about in the various fastnesses of the Cau casus, they are rarely more than a few hundred strong in any one zone instead of being more or less elastically-combined into one force under a common leader and staff, as had been the intention to bring about finally 6. For the time being, at least, Moslems and Christians appear to be working together against the Soviets ; while, on the other hand, Pan-Turkish propaganda seems to be out of favour completely. The Persians also would not seem disposed to give such Pan-Turkish propaganda much chance of recovering the lost ground. 7. At present it would seem that the Soviets have strong patrols along the Julfa-Tiflis Railway—which they are determined to keep open—as well as two armoured trains upon it. But their actual grip on the Caucasus seems to be con fined to this Railway and the coastal plains. The mountainous part of the Caucasus is quite out of their control at the moment, despite their attempts at surrounding particular bands of rebels, or attempting operations on a larger scale in a few par ticular spots. The use of “ mixed ” units has also proved disastrous to them, as the non- Russian elements often desert, and take even their guns and machine guns with them. 8. One prominent Cheka leader, Abbas Kuli Khan, attempted to reduce Buyek Vedi. This is a village upon almost impregnable heights, situated a little less than half-way from Nakchevan to Erivan. Many of the Cheka leader's men deserted to the rebels after killing him himself. Later, some of them succeeded in100 crossing into Persia, and at this moment three men are under open arrest at Tabriz upon suspicion of being deserters from this group of the Soviet forces. This of course, upon the request of the Russian consul-general. Baku Zone. 9. In the case of Nookly—west of Baku and on the borders of Daghestan—the revolt started about the middle of May, and for some ten or twelve days the village remained in the hands of the rebels. A strong force was sent agamst them, and when the rebels took to the hills, a circle was drawn round them. Part of the besieging troops, however, deserted to the rebels, with their rifles ammunition, machine guns and cannon. The latest report is that active hostilies are still going on in this zone, and that these rebels gave received some reinforcements from Daghestan. Kurdish Ora. 10. A district in Russian Azeitaijan (Baku zcne), inhabited by a purely Kur dish stock which was transplanted thereby Shah Abbas and later Shahs as a deli berate policy. Early in April they revolted under their leader, Sultanof, or Sultan Bey, the brother of the late Governor of the entire Kara Bagh District, Khoskov Bey. They killed many Government officials and expelled the rest, and have maintained themselves since arainst all efforts to subdue them. But there have been many who escaped later into Persia. Sultanof himself crossed into Persia and, using the KaraDagh as a base, raided the adjoining Russian tetrritoty, at least once. It is reported to me that he encountered Russian troops on this occasion and that a running fight took place, which ended in Sultanof returning to the Kara Dagh. He is said to have been sent to Tabriz at the request of the Russian consul- general. It will be seen from this last item how and why the Kurds, even outside Russia have become disposed to make common cause against the Cuacasian Soviets. Zangizur. 11. At the south-eastern corner of Mount Ararat there is a plain. The moun tain is in the Turkish territory, but the plain in Russian Armenia. From this plain a mountainous region runs eastwards to Zangizur, and this region has be come a refuge for all the rebellious Tartars, Armenians and, “ Sarasins ” (i.e., Lazos) of the vicinity. Guerilla warfare is being carried on from this base and raids made on any Soviet posts, no quarter being given to any of the Cheka or their adherents who are captured. The Soviets have not yet so much as ventured t° ma ke a serious attempt to repress this particular section. I gather that the country is more difficult than the Cyrenaican Jebel, and, moreover, similarly honey combed—as is also part of Mount Ararat proper-—with caves situated in the faces of precipitous cliffs, upon which guns cannot be trained. The Russians, however, seem to hope that this particular focus will exhaust itself. There appear to be many va eys which can be used for escape into Turkey or Persia, and many rebels appear o e, in fact, withdrawing by them. But on the 25th and 26th May a running fight 0C j cF • G near ^ e ghry between a band of mounted Tartar refugees from this zone and Soviet troops. The Soviets lost two officers and twenty men killed—so I am f r7 W ' ] i e refugees also suffered fairly severely. Another report says that the combined casualties to date are around 200. These refugees crossed the Araxes, and their leader is now in Tabriz. This incident caused still another protest by the Russian consul-general. 12. I venture to think that I have made it clear that no intelligible view of the situation can be given without going into the Turkish side of the situation. I feel ic more justified as His Majesty’s Embassy at Angora has asked through His i ajes y s Minister at Tehran for copies of my reports on the eastern corner of na 0 Ia * ^ quite agree that more news is likely to percolate in this direction than o penetrate the I urkish veil of censorship westwards and northwards of Erzerum. Turkish Ararat. 13. To recapitulate shortly ^ ers ^ an general for North-West Persia—Sartib Kafer Dauleh— quelled the Kurdish rising at Sauj Bulak in 1928. After the Shah’s visit here, he i\ as to mterview a Turkish commission at Igdir, in Anatolia, at the foot of Mount Ararat.He is alleged to have seized tins opportumtyto establish friendly relations with the Turkish Kurds ; while he himself told me he intended to handle the Persian Kurds very delicately and not disarm them at present. 14. In November 1929 it was decided that the Turco-Persian Boundary Com mission, which seemed to ha\e reached a deadlock, should resume discussions in April 1930. There, however, appeared no possibility then or now of an agreement fully acceptable to both parties, 'there were acute disegreements, the chief point of discord being that each party desired the other to make the first step towards disarming such Kurdish tribes as were clearly within its own undisputed territoiy. This the general had no intention of doing, as already said. Neither side was willing to stir up a hornet’s nest, and nothing came of the discussions. 15. It would seem, moreover, that certain of the Turkish territorial claims would never be acceptable to the Persians, and that the latter, far from being in any hurry to resume the discussions this year, felt that they had everything to gain by continual postponement in the hope that time and political changes might make the Turks less exacting. 16. In any case, the general has spent several weeks this year in negotiating with the Kurds along the Turkish frontier, and he is even reported to me as having hinted that they would do well to resist any attempt of the Turks to disarm them. 17. Be that as it may, in April 1930 the Kurdish tribes of Mount Ararat made several attacks on Turkish outposts at or near Bayazid, Kara Kilisseh, and even quite close to Erzerum. A strong force was sent against them, but failed in all three attempts to round them up. 18. The Turks W'ere consequently themselves forced to postpone the resump tion of boundary negotiations till this month (June). .19. I am now told that the Turks near Maku have informed the general that- they intend to make a determined effort to exterminate the Kurdish rebels now on Mount Ararat, and asked the general to guard his frontier effectively and prevent refugees from there crossing into Persia. © © I will give what is known of the resulting new disposition of Persian troops at the end of this section of my report (paragraph 21). 20. The Kurds of Mount Ararat have their main concentration at Kiralar, This is an almost inaccessible position, honeycombed with caves, situated in the faces of precipices, which can only be approached by goat-tracks or climbing, and upon which neither cannon nor machine guns can be trained, but where the defend ers must be dislodged by hand grenades after an ascent during wdiich the attackers would be exposed to a merciless fire without the possibility of making any effectiv e reply. The Turks failed at this very spot two years ago, and no one here-—and probably least of all the general-—believes that the Turks can succeed now either. The general has, how r ever, acceded to the Turkish request, has gone himself to Maku, and sent considerable number of troops there. 21. The following dispositions have, therefore, been taken Yavar Fatullah Tohidi Khan w^as sent to Maku as commandant there some weeks back. From Tabriz one gurdan (i.e., 500 men) of infantry and six machine guns left or Maku on the 3rd June. 350 more men were sent from Sauj-Bulak, and there were already about 250 there. On the 17th May, 200 conscripts were sent to Sauj-Bulak from ' Maragha ; while, on the 25th May, 130 conscripts were sent from Sarab to (so it was reported to me) Tehran. The present net dispositions along the Turkish frontier and at Tabriz are reported to me as about:— Tabriz : 1,200 infantry still here, and 400 cavalry. Sauj-Bulak : 800—1,000 still there. Urumia : 1,200. Khoi : 1,000. Salmas : 750. Maku : 1,100, or, according to another report, l,2o0, guns. and at least six machine MC445FDConscripts have been gradually drafted in, and time-expired men gradually either disbanded or passed into the “ Emnieh ” (gendarmerie). In this period of flux I cannot hope at present to obtain very accurate figures, but it is clear that there are much stronger forces along the Turkish than the Russian frontier. The Julfa garrison has only been slightly increased, and the Ardabil Regiment increased by recruits less disbandments. There should nominally be about sixty men at Julfa, and about 1,000 infantry and 400 cavalry in the Ardabil district. Khor Hussein Pasha's son. 21a. A further complication in the Mount Ararat problem is caused by the fact that the only surviving son of Khor Hussein Pasha has joined the Kurds there. Khor Hussein was implicated in Sheikh Sayyid’s revolt of 1924-25. He himself— who used to occupy the regions north-west of Lake Van—was detained in Angora, but escaped to Syria. He was killed with his three other sons later on when trying to re-enter Turkey. 22. The Turks would, therefore, seem to have to face a formidable band of malcontents, established in a much stronger position than the Jebel of Cyrenaica— which has proved too much for the Italians—and under the leadership of a bitter enemy ; malcontents who are certainly backed by Persian moral support, and pos sibly even supplied with Persian ammunition and such food as is not provided by nature. 23. Besides His Majesty’s Embassy at Angora, I am also sending copy of this report to His Majesty’s Residency at Bagdad, as I am also informed that a move ment is on foot to cla m autonomy (at first, if unavoidable, under a British man date) for a 1 l the Kurds from Mount Ararat to the Hekkary [sic] District, described- to me as the name for the zone bordering upon Iraq. 24. It would appear that the state of anarchy in Central and Northern Turkish Kurdistan is not very much better at present than that of the Caucasus. Baku-Julfa Railway. 25. To return to the Caucasus. I am told that, besides the main Baku-Julfa Railway, a branch is being bu It into the Ghapan portion of the Zengizur district to tap the rich copper mines there. These m.nes had long been exploited by a French company, but are now nationalised. 26. My actual maps are of little help to me, where the Caucasus is concerned, and I am at present endeavouring to obtain Russian maps from Erivan. 27. On the 5th June I received at code telegram from His Majesty s Residency at Baghdad asking me to control and report the movements of one Dineley, who left for Tabriz via I^owanduz and Riat on the 26th May. Dineley has an Iraqian passport, while his servant, Habibullah, was known to have an Iraqian passport and believed to hold an Afghan passport as well. Dineley s conduct in Kurd sh zones had aroused unfavourable comment. 28. I interviewed the police and the military, and found that Dineley, who had arrived here on the 2nd June, was sti.l here, He has been placed under unobtrusive surveillance. Enclosure 3 in No. 1, Consul Palmer to Sir R. Clive. (No. 97, Very Confidential,) Tabriz, June 8, 1930. I have the honour to report that I was told yesterday over the telephone that the general had unexpectedly returned from Maku at 2 a.m., and would leave for Ahar the next day. I therefore made an appointment at once, and had a long interview with him yesterday afternoon. 2, It was long before I could broach the subject of Dineley to him {cf. my memorandum in No. 96, paragraphs 27 and 28). 3. Dineley s actions will be closely watched in future, and at my request a report on his behaviour on the Persian side of the Rowanduz route will be obtainejin due course from Sauj-Bulak. Dinelely told the chief of the Tabriz po ice that he was going on a voyage through Russia, Siberia and the United States. 4. Much of what the general was extremely eager to tell me modifies certain statements in my !No. 96 which had already been handed to my clerk to type. But the basic facts given in my No. 96 were confirmed by the general, and I am therefore leaving it as it stands, and merely adding the later details. The situation disclosed below is presumably only temporary. 5. There is no doubt whatever that the relations between Persia and Russia are about as tense as they can safely be. 6. T he Russian consul-genera has repeatedly demanded— (a) The return of all refugees to Russia, without any discrimination whatever between transgressors of common law, brigands, political refugees, etc. This the Persians refuse to agree to do, as they know such surrender usually ends in execution of the unfortunates concerned. (b) The removal of the Armenian archbishop, and his replacement by a no minee of the Archbishop of Tiflis (a mere Soviet puppet at present). (c) The dismissal of all Persian army officers of Caucasian origin in the North- Western Army. The Persians have refused or evaded replying to all three demands. 7. The Russians then threatened to follow refugees into Persian territory, using their own troops. 8. The Persians then arrested five of the refugee rebel chiefs, including Sul- tanof, and the genera assures me that they are all now in Tabriz. 9. The Russians next declared that the Persians w T ere massing troops on their frontier, and that as they might go to war with Poland they w T ould like to know what the Persian attitude would be in this case. Meanwhile, they pushed on work upon the Baku-Julfa Railway with feverish activity. 10. The Persians replied that they had not more than 400 men, including customs officials and guards, along the wffiole Russian frontier. The genera con firmed to me that he only had 60 men at Julfa and 150 at Astara, with about 800 at Ardabil and some cavalry. This agrees with my report No. 96. 11. He had, however, built a series of stone blockhouses along his side of the River Araxes, and these 400 men were dispersed in small batches of twenty to twenty-five men throughout these blockhouses. The Russians also objected to these blockhouses, 12. During the night of the 2nd-3rd June the Russians brought up a large force of troops, estimated to him at 2,500, in six trains (upon the new Baku-Julfa Railway), to a point opposite Khudafirin, i.e,, in the Zengizur zone. 13. There is a bridge at this point, entirely in Persian territory, and he had built a new blockhouse at its southern end. 14. The Russ an troops crossed this bridge and occupied Khudafirin, arrested the postmaster (released later), cut the telegraph and telephone wires, and retreated thirty hours later, taking with them six persons whom they had arrested as suspected of intriguing actively aga nst them. 15. The general believes that some damage was done to the blockhouse or that there w r as an .incident there, but he could get no definite news till the postmaster w r as released and made his way to the next telephone station. His first news came to him through villagers who had brought the news (pro bably garbled) to another post, and he had sent in other villagers to report upon the situation. 16. The postmaster’s version, w hen it finally reached him, caused him to return here from Maku. But he first gave orders to counter-march the 500 men from Tabriz destined for Maku; so he sent them eastward to occupy the two passes which are the only outlets from the rugged and mountainous forest behind Khudafirin.104 17. He considered that Khudafirin was a most unlikely place for a serious invasion. The forest was on broken ground, the “ roads ” terrible, and the Shah- sevan tribes had blood connexions with the tribes on the Russian side. They would certainly harass any advance through this forest, while his troops could hold the only two passes behind. 18. He admitted, however, that it would take him at least a week to concentrate his available guns and machine-guns in any one spot. He was loath to “ show his hand ” prematurely as to his eventual plan of defence ; and he could not make up his m nd whether the above Russian aggression was merely by way of intimidation or whether it was in the nature of a test manoeuvre, i.e., to see whether it was possible to make a surprise descent upon Persian territory before any concentration could be made by the Persians to resist such surprise attacks ; to test the working of the new railway, etc. In that case the next descent might be elsewhere. 19. He added that there had been alarmist articles in the Baku and Batum press about the Rowanduz route, and that this route and the reorganization of the Persian army were subjects of great preoccupation to Russia. He feared Russia might attack before either of the above was terminated. 20. He was beginning to think that a Russo-Persian c ash was inevitable. It might be almost at once, or only when the Baku-Julfa Railway and branch road to Lenkoran were finished. He intended, however, after his return from the Ahar district in a few days time, to ask to go to Tehran to see the Shah and point out to him that a clash seemed bound to come, and that it would be better to start making all preparations for it at once. He had telegraphed direct to the Shah himself over the recent episode. 21. It was clear to me that the general was sincerely pessimistic about the future ; and was convinced that the Russians were seeking to pick a quarrel. He added that he had had frequent demands for ammunition, hand grenades, etc., from the rebels in Russia ; but that, although smuggling would be easy at several points on the River Araxes, he had always refused to help the rebels in any way. He would not even now increase his display of troops on the actual south bank of the Araxes, although the Russians had recently much increased the guards on their side. He might even withdraw his men from the Ahar region again before long ; as it was not a vulnerable spot like Julfa or Astara, and therefore unlikely to be chosen for a serious attempt at invasion. 22. I gathered that he had very little artillery at his disposal at the moment* and I could see that my remarks upon this last point caused him uneasiness. 23. As I left I saw some infantry and some cavalry starting off. I imagine that, in all, 1,000—1,500 men will have been sent to the Ahar zone with several machine-guns, but that there is at the moment no great abundance of artillery of any sort. Turkish Frontier. 24. The Forntier Commission is now fixed to meet on the 10th July. 25. The Turks had, in fact, concentrated a force to attack Kiralar in the Mount Ararat zone, but a military commission arrived and decided that it would need 50,000 to 60,000 men to effect any result. The idea was, therefore, aban doned ; and the troops are now being withdrawn. 26. At the time of the Nakchevan incidents, the Turks made a strong concen tration of troops on their side of the bridge of Makari. Half of this bridge is Turkish and half Russian, while it opens upon the direct road to Erivan. The Russians asked for an explanation for this concentration, and the Turks withdrew their troops after they had been there four or five days. The general considered that there was some coolness between Turkey and Russia at the present moment. 27. To sum up, the general said that the Soviets had already completely destroyed several villages in the Caucasus and wiped out all the inhabitants whom they had been able to catch. But that they could not enter the real mountainous zone, where at least 12,000 and perhaps as many as 20,000 men were still in arms.unless there wi someth ng be to 0 '^ t0WardS Pe f a ’ and b ^-edthat revolt of all the Caucasus, or a war withVlL ThTp’ SUCh aS el * er a S eneral later, attack Azerbaijan. and ’ the Russian s would, sooner or Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Consul Palmer to Sir R. Clive. [No. 101 (Confidential).] I have the honour raid. Tabriz, June 10, 1930. to confirm my report No. 97 as regards the Russian military 2. Six hundred Russian cavalry crossed the Axaxes at three points and dis- armed the small guards (eight or ten men at each post) at three blockhouses at u a rm, Rhomanly and Ashghly. They took away the bolts of their rifles and arrested their subaltern and sent them to Russia. Meanwhile, about 2 000 infantry with machine guns were manning the northern bank. arily 3 arreste t d le8ral&gt;h an&lt;1 telephone wires were cut &gt; and the postmasters tempor- 4' T n ca 1 ' ra, 1 ry then a dvanced about 30 Idiom, inland. On reaching Voghan in the Kara Dagh they surrounded the villa of the rich Persian-Armenian Toumanian whmh they alleged had been used as a base by refugees. Finding no suspects there, they burnt the villa and marched on to Vena, south-west of Vo&lt;dian. Here the captured two refugee rmtables, whom they flogged almost to death and then des patched into Russia. The peasants of this district have evacuated their homes in panic, and some began to reach Tabriz on the 8th June. 5. There was some resistance shown in various spots. Human Bey one of the refugee chiefs, was killed. 6. Other persons arrested and despatched to Russia were : Chanraman Khan— a Shahsevan chief—and a Persian Armenian notable of Vena named Babajan. The raiders then retired after a sojourn of over thirty hours in Persian territory. The exact number of casualties and of persons carried off is not yet known. 7. The I ersians were taken completely by surprise, and the menace of the new Baku-Julfa Railway line is dramatically proved. 8. In April Jibrail, chief of the Hekkarly Tartar tribe from the Russian bank of the Araxes, took refuge in Persia with 100 horsemen and several of their families. He left these families in the Kara Dagh, but sent back half his men into Russia— presumably to fetch other families. This party encountered Russian troops on the 27th May and, as already reported, twenty Russian soldiers and two officers were killed and the Tartars retired fighting into Persia again. Presumably the Russian raid was to punish the above incident and also to try to round up the leaders of it. 9. Jibrail himself, however, had not remained in the Kara Dagh, but had come to Tabriz, where he and Sultan Bey Sultan of had actually called upon the Archbishop on Easter Sunday. 10. This call is considered here very significant, as previously while in Russia the Tartars would have nothing to do with the Armenians. 11. The Russian consul-general has summoned here his commercial represen tatives from Julfa, Ahar and other frontier posts for a conference. 12. It is rumoured here that the Russian Minister at Tehran has apologised for the raid and promised the punishment of the Russian leaders. Even if true, no one here believes that this apology and promise are sincere. (92) {Received on 10th August 1930 with Political Secretary's letter No. 30, dated the 24th July 1930.) P. 4574/30. Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, No. K. 7611/7611/234, dated 17th July, 1930. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 254, dated the 12th June 1930. With reference to Sir Austen Chamberlain’s despatch No. 592 (K. 15479/15479/ 224) of the 29th December 1926 regarding certain changes in the scope of theforeign debt, unless the disputed war and post-war advances by His Majesty’s Government in the Ijnited Kingdom are to be so counted. Moreover, pecu lation, though still rife and inherent in the nature of the people, is more often punished and therefore perhaps practised on a less lordly scale than formerly, though Teymourtache seems to have given full rein to his natural instincts in this direction. 9. 1 hus from the point of view of her position in the world Persia can, I think, look back with satisfaction on the last twelve years. She has achieved practical independence from foreign interference and from restraints which have irked her for so long, the phentom of which still appears to haunt Reza Shah. Having got all that any sane people would want, the Persians, like the Irish, are never satisfied and are keenly on the look-out for any real or imaginary cases of lese-sovverainete. Hence the con stant pinpricks inflicted on a long-suffering diplomatic corps. But even the most rabid manifestations of nationalism might be tolerable to foreigners living among them were it not for the additional annoyance caused by the overweening vanity of this ‘‘bandar log” amongst nations. 10 . Yet actually I suppose there are few contented Persians today, except for the office-holders. The peasants are probably worse off even than in the famine years after the war; such at least is Vosuk-ed-Dowleh’s opinion. They cannot sell their produce, hamperd as commerce is by the trade mono poly law : they can, of course, live on what they grow but whereas in the past the poor man would drink for a few shahis a glass of weak tea half filled with sugar, now he can afford neither of these “luxuries”, which are taxed about twice as highly as whiskey in the United Kingdom. Of what use to tell him that instead he has motor roads, sugar factories, spinning mills, an up-to-date army and a railway in the making ? The old aristocracy loathes the new regime. The merchant class are ruined by the world crisis, the quarrels with the Soviet and the Persian Government’s economic policy. But the Shah believes in the dictum “oderint dum metuant.” Nobody dares to voice his complaints: the press is servile and parliament a mere voting machine. In fact the whole nation is entirely dominated and terro rized by the single and most remarkable figure of the only great personality in Persia, Reza Shah Pahlevi. 11 . His Majesty has built his power upon the army and will probably so maintain it as long as he lives. He is, in real fact, his own Minister of War and he can make or unmake a General in a minute : the officers are thus loyal and zealous through a natural regard to their careers, and the men who are better clothed and treated than their civilian friends are probably contented enough. The Persian army of today is smart and well turned out and compares well in appearance with that of other minor Powders: twelve years ago there were a few thousand gendarmes and cossacks, foreign officered and several thousand scallywaggs. 12. The other great instrument of the Shah’s internal policy is the Police, whose activities are ubiquitous and disquieting. It is said that His Majesty himself receives reports on all the visitors to important personages; that “he knoweth their goings out and their comings in”. The result is that all Persians are in mortal terror of a sojourn in the edifice now politely referred to as “Teyrnourtache’s house”. Many of my old friends have frankly admitted that they dare not come near me for this reason. There is much whispered criticism and grumbling, but no one dares lift a finger nor speak a brave word in public against the tyranny which is weighing on the lives of all in Tehran. 13. How t long even Persia can be run on fear of one man it is difficult to prophesy. Her history is a long record of tyrants, varying in the degree of their ferocity, and Persians probably dislike oppression less than most people. The fact remains that the Shah’s earlier popularity has long since vanished and he is now almost universally loathed and detested. Nasr-ed- Din Shah lived through periods of intense unpopularity but in those days a Shah was expected to do what he willed and ordinary human standards ofbehaviour were not expected of him. Moreover, he did not interfere too much with the everyday lives of his subjects. ^Nowadays, however, the hand of the Government is everywhere and people know that the Government is merely the mouthpiece of Keza Shah. Their acquiescence in oppression may continue till the end of the reign, although the number of men, both civilians and officers, who have been broken for incurring the royal dis pleasure is already large and continues to grow. Some of them remain virtual prisoners in Tehran while the Shah adds their properties to his already vast personal estates: others are biding their time in exile. All of them know that His Majesty is over sixty and ageing rapidly. It is diffi cult to believe that his dynasty can survive him. 14. It is easy to fall into the error of believing that the striking changes on which I have been reflecting are more fundamental than is really the case, for, after all, the essential character of the Persian has not altered in this short period under review. He is still, with few exceptions, the same vainglorious, intriguing, witty, untruthful, cowardly, sensual, money-loving and corrupt being immortalized by Morier. He has changed his clothes, his house, his habits to meet the advance of western ideas: he now keeps one wife, one motor car and four servants where his father kept wives, horses and servants innumerable. He has not, however, managed to look at any question through western eyes nor to analyse it with western logic. .This is why the task of His Majesty’s Legation in Persia must still continue to be a thankless one and why negotiations are always so tortuous and wearisome. In spite of its accidental veneer we are not dealing with a modern state, but with an .oriental despotism. ( 100 ) Despatch from British Legation, Gulhak, to Foreign Office, London, (Department of Overseas Trade), No. (B)-140, dated the 15th July 1933. (Copies to India No. C-33, Baghdad C-61, Bushire C-ll, Ahwaz C-32 and ; Basra C-3). In confirmation of my telegram of July 12 not received 1 have the honour to report that on July 6 th I received a telegram from His Majesty’s Consul at Basra stating that Messrs. Strick had been reliably informed that the Persian Government were asking for tenders through your Department for two or three oil-burning vessels of 6,000 to 7,000 tons capacity, and inquiring whether T could ascertain details and also whether the Persian Government would be interested in the purchase of second-hand tonnage. 2. Inquiries made at the Ministry of Roads and Communications and at the Department of Commerce elicited the reply that nothing was known in those Departments, but that the Ministry of Finance might be able to give the desired information. A telephone message was later received from the Ministry of Finance saying that the Minister would be pleased to see me bn the morning of the 12 th instant. 3. This interview took place as arranged, and His Excellency Taghizadeh informed me that the inquiry was a genuine one, and was being pursued ia other countries as well as in the United Kingdom. The Persian Government had not, however, gone into details. They were anxious to have two or three cargo vessels of about the size mentioned, their main object being apparently to show the Persian flag in foreign ports. They would like the ships to be equipped for carrying a certain number of passengers. As they were rather afraid of getting the worst of the deal if they bought second hand, they would prefer to buy new ones. If possible they would like to buy ships already completed, but otherwise they would be prepared to pl ace orders for building. |j 4. His Excellency said that he would like to have advice of a technical nature before placing the orders or buying ships, and I suggested that i might be possible to obtain from your Department the names of two or thiceimpartial shipping experts who could furnish the desired information and advice against the usual fees. The Minister said that he would be very grateful if this information could be obtained for him, and would like to be informed at the same time approximately how long it would take to build such ships if it were necessary to have them built to order. 5. From the telegram referred to in paragraph 1 above I imagined that Messrs. Strick were interested in the possible sale of used tonnage to the Persian (government, but it seems also likely that they as well as other British shipping lines calling at Persian ports would be keenly interested in any eventual state-run and subsidised line competing with them for cargo to and from Europe. It is early to speculate on the possible effect of such competition should it materialize, but if the Persian Government are determined to buy ships it is certainly desirable that such orders should be placed in the United Kingdom. ( 101 ) Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 357, dated the 15th July 1933. (Copies to India No. 141, and Baghdad No. 57). With reference to your telegram No. 109 of the 7th July, I have the honour to state that in the course of conversation today with the Minister for Foreign Affairs I mentioned, among other matters of which I had occa sion to complain to His Highness, the case of Captain Macleod. I said that I had addressed a note of protest to him which would probably reach him today and that I would not, therefore, weary him with the details. My concern was mainly that a British subject had been treated in such an extra ordinary way by the Persian Navy. 2. Feroughi started a long and rambling dissertation about Persian pre tensions to the Shatt-el-Arab. I told him that I was not here to discuss that question today, as it mainly concerned ’Iraq. What worried me was that here was another instance, of interference with a British subject who was merely carrying out his ordinary duties and I hoped that the Persian na\ al officers would be warned to be more careful in future. I recognised that prompt action by His Highness had prevented the incident from developing more unpleasantly. 3 . The Minister could not, however, be stopped from pouring out to me his complaints against the Traq Government. There was the question of the waterway: there was also the question of the Kurdish frontier where incidents were of frequent occurrence. Brigands and lawless Kurds were frequent]v dodging Persian justice by slipping over the frontier, and then I gathered, engaging in nefarious intrigues against Persia. I said that luckily this was the affair of the Traq Government and not ours, buu I wondered why it was that the Persian military authorities did not prevent these brigands from leaving Persia. As regards the Shatt-el-Ara , ' * careful tS avoid being drawn into any discussion. I merely remarked that I understood that Sir Francis Humphrys had gone carefully into all the.e frontier questions when he visited Tehran and I wondered why there had been no progress since. Feroughi expressed his intense adrmration or ^ Francis, but expressed a fear that in the changed circumstances of TraqHis Fxcellencv was no longer in a position to bring as much influence to bear , ~ formerly/ I told His Highness that I thought that His Majesty s Ambassa dor’s influence was still very strong, though now exercised in anothe In view of your instructions I went no further, though it would ha\e * easy to mention The question of the Tripartite Conservancy Board. I gatberedAdiat Feroughi had been having rather heated -terview, with t^ ’Iraq Minister, who is probably not paving the way towards sucl an agreement. 187(C) f&amp;pd137 4 As I was armed with several other complaints I then led the conver sation via the interference by the Persian navy with Kuwait dhows to the peneral system of pinpricks which still seemed to prevail in spite of all Hig Highness’ assurances of goodwill. I gave several instances and told him frankly that I was sad and disappointed that our efforts should be thwarted by the stupidity and insolence of minor officials of the police, military, naval and customs forces. Life was none to pleasant in such circumstances and wherever I went I heard nothing but grumbling. I was never allowed to meet Persians and they never dared visit me for fear of the fate of Ra shid i. I was forced to associate entirely with diplomats and members of the foreign community and I had never befctre lived in such an atmosphere of discontent. 1 ventured to tell His Highpess that the whole diplomatic corps seemed to be seething with annoyance and only living for the day when they could depart from Persia. I myself liked living in this country but it made me miserable to live among people who did nothing but grumble. His Highness was so good as to take my deliberate outburst in excellent part and tried to excuse himself as usual with talk about the wickedness of the northern neighbour. “You tell me” I said, “that you have terrible diffi culties with Russia and trouble with ’Iraq, and then you allow your petty officials to continue to upset relations with Great Britain, with whom you have, on your own admission, no quarrel whatever.” Feroughi protested, as he always does, the sincerest friendship, and his personal cordiality towards me after my outspokenness to him was even warmer than usual. I am not, however, vain enough to believe that my words will have the slightest effect. ( 102 ) (Received on 22nd July 1933, with Political Secretary's letter No. 27, dated 6th July 1933.)

This manifesto was one of the contributory causes to the later embargo on the sale of gelatine. As Mr. Acting Consul Davis reported at the time the “Elections” were a mere farce, and they would probably have been so more or less even without the above manifesto. The deputies were virtually preordained from Tehran, and only about 6000 voters appear to have thought it worth the trouble of ^oin? * to tl lP Polls at all., &amp; D to me (104) (Received on 22nd July 1933, with Political Secretary's letter No. 21 dated 6th July 1933.) Despatch from H. M.’s Minister Tehran, to Foreign Office, London No. 234, dated the 19th May 1933. With reference to paragraph 3 of the annual report on Pars for 1932 I have the honour ito report that rumours are still rife respecting the opera tions against Ali Khan. 2. The reports that reach the acting consul at Shiraz are highly con flicting and it is difficult to form a connected story on which any reliability could be placed. But on the 11 th April, Government troops to'the number of about 300 under Sartip Ibrahim Khan supported by local tribal levies proceeded to the Jahru—Firuzabad area in order to attack the insurgent leadei. The total troops in the field are now about 2,500. Ali Khan is rumoured to be at the head of no less than 15,000 rebels and to have been joined by some of the Khamseh Arabs and Luristanis. 3. I attach no particular credence to these figures, but the fact that wild rumours continue to reach me is interesting as showing that the country is not as pacified as fhe press and local officials would wish it to be believed. .4. I am sending copies of this despatch toithe Honourable the Political Pesident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire (No. 70) and to the acting British consul at Shiraz (No. 14). (105) ^Received on 29th July 1933, with Political Secretary' s letter No 28, dated : &lt; 13th July 1933.) Despatch from H. M s. Charge d’affaires, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 299, dated the 17th June 1933. I have the honour to report that Mirza Yahya Khan Qaragozlou resigned (or was allowed to resign) the post of Minister of Education on the 6 th instant. It has been known for some time that he had been hoping lO! a diplomatic post abroad : in August last it was announced that he had been appointed Persian Minister in Paris. The announcement was subse quently found to be inaccurate and Mirza Yahya Khan continued at his post. To judge, from certain remarks of Monseiur Godard, the French Director of Antiquities, it has lately become more and more difficult ^ persuade His Excellency to take any decision involving any responsibility- As for the reason for His Excellency’s resignation, the ex-Minister’s own exp. ana Lion is illness. He has been in charge of the Ministry, an arduous, exacting and worrying post, since January 1928, and may therefore very natm ally be longing for a change. It seems probable however that his own pusillanimity was the real reason for his retirement. The story current i * 1 local gossip is thait during recent examinations a number of vociferous students complained to the Shah that they had been unfairly examiu^’with the result that His Majesty sent for His Excellency, and, in language more appropriate to the barrack square (than to the court, roundly abused him and told him that he must go. &lt; 2. Doctor Ahmad Khan Muhsini (Imad-ul-Mulk), hitherto Director of the Department of Public Instruction in Azerbaijan, is announced as His Excellency’s successor, though merely a “gerant” of the Minister. Doctor Ahmed Khan is not personally known to any member of His Majesty’s Legation but he is said to have studied under Professor Browne in Cambridge. 3. Mirza Yahya was one of the senior members of the present Cabinet, in point of view of uninterrupted service. I'hree Ministers only can claim a longer period : viz., the aged Mehdi Quli Khan Hidayat, Jaafar Quli As’ad and Ali Akber Khan Davar, who have all been continuously employed since June, 1927. The last-named is the only one who appears to have any real say in the affairs for which he is nominally responsible, and it is remarkable^ that he has been clever enough to hold his place so long. As for As’ad and the Prime Minister,, there seems no reason why they should not go on until they die. As’ad’s functions are mainly confined to accompanying the Shah on his journeys, and the octogenarian Prime Minister has only to attend. Cabinet meetings three times a week and sign his name in the proper places. He contrives to while away the rest of his. time in his garden at Darrus, with the help of a musician playing the tar and a new “sigheh” or temporary wife the seventeen year old daughter of his gardener.

With reference to His Majesty’s Minister’s despatch No. 113 of the 20th March last (not received), I have the honour to inform you that the local press has recently been publishing paragraphs, regarding a scheme to utilise two streams from the Karaj River for a hydro-electric plant between Tehran and Karaj. The scheme,, which is said to have been drawn up by a Russian engineer, presumes a current of six hundred kilowatts being obtainable from this water aided by a fairly high waterfall. The cost is estimated at Rials one million, six hundred and seventy thousand, which it is hoped to redeem in the first year of operation, according to the “Ettola’ ap’ of 3rd June. 2 . Previous schemes have been based on the Djajarud River with its more adequate flow of waiter, and it is possible that this new proposal has been put up merely in order to stimulate the Belgian “Society des Transtions et d’Electricite” whose agreement with the Government, reported signed in Mr. Hoare’s despajtch No. 15 of the 13th January last [S.

With further reference to my reports Nos. 58 and 69 [Enclo. to Serial No. (98)], concerning refugees from Russia, I have the honour to report that the Director of Public Security has now declared that according to his final lists of refugees who crossed ‘this winter into Persia (without proper travel documents) via the Ardabil District, Astara, Bilasavar, Khal-Khal aji Julfa, the number attained 2,500. ' » • 2. They were Tartars, Russians including Jews, and Armenians. A part has already left for South Persia, Sayin Kalch, Hijar, Tihan- Tapa, eto.; and the remainder are being despatched in small batches. 3 . The Shah has sent 2,500 tomans towards their travel expenses, and each refugee receives 1 rial for each farsakh travelled. 4 The refugees brought here from Julfa and the others whose depor tation was reported in my No. 69 had been sent to Sayin Kalch and Hijar. 5 . I should here add that public opinion here is all in favour of the removal of these refugees from here. Incidents such as the murder of the bookseller here, reported in my January Diary, the general increase of burglary and attempted burglary-— two instances of which in the case of the German Consulate were related in my report No. 74 —are credited with a large degree of probability (proof in the case of the above murder) to indigent refugees or actual habitual criminals among such refugees; and the best way to deal with such undesir able elements would seem to be to settle them in agricultural districts where more population is wanted. /V In this town they only increase the unemployed element, are condemned to semi-starvation (especially since the hard winter, and inevitable poor harvests and rise of cost of living. in prospect), and in some cases might embroil the Persians in frontier incidents with the Russians.■ 1 ' w ' ^ 143 ( 112 ) (Received on 5th August 1933, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 29, dated v - 1 v goth July 1933.) Despatch from H. M.’s Minister, Tehran to Foreign Office, London, ■ NO. 259, DATED THE 1ST JUNE 1933. With reference to my desptch No. 51 of the 10th February respecting conditions in Luristan, I have the honour ,to inform you that according to reports received from His Majesty s consul at Ahwaz the situation has greatly improved during the last three months. 2 Sepahbud (Marshal) Ahmed Agha Khan left Pul-i-Dukhtar in February in order to attack YadullaHi Khan in the mountains, having the assistance on this occasion of a force of Kurds from Fusht-i-Kuh. He had previously sent two Saiyids with a Koran to Yadullah to persuade him to make peace with the Government, but he had declined the terms offered him. In the following month the Sepahbud inflicted a defeat on Yadullah s forces, but Yadullah himself escaped. g latest news is to the effect that \ adullah has at last accepted the Government’s terms. He stayed for some days with the Sepahbud at Khorremabad in April and is even said to have left subsequently for Tehran. In the meantime the former outlaws have been given land by the bepanbud along both sides of the Khorremabad road, including, it is said, the property known as Waisian, near Khorremabad, which belonged .to the late Nizam-us- Sultaneh. They are at present living in their black tents, but are busy building houses/ The Revenue Department is supplying grain and money, for their food and other requirements. 4. The condition of the Khorremabad! road is reported to be good and safe. 5. I am. sending copies of this despatch to His Ma jesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 36), His Majesty’s consul, Ahwaz (No. 43) and to the acting British consul a^t Kermanshah (No. 12). (113; (Received on 5th August 1933, with Political Secretary's letter No. 29, dated: 20th July 1933.) Despatch from Foreign Office, London, to H. M.’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, No. 292, dated the 13th July 1933. In Sir Reginald Hoare’s despatch No. 228 of the 12th May [Serial No. (59)], he requested information regarding any provisions that may exis in highly civilised countries for ensuring against undue delay in bringing an arrested man to trial by the deliberate prolongation of the preliminary investigation or instruction. 2 . I am advised that the position upon the point in this country is as follows :— Under English Law, in most cases, before a man can be arrested at all, a warrant must be issued by a magistrate. In order that a warran should be issued, the application for it must be placed upon sworn inior' mation, and the warrant itself contains the charge on which the man is accused (For the present purposes the cases where persons may be com prehended without a warrant are left out of account; these are mainly cases where a person is found actually committing a breach of the peace, o something worse; and in any case where a person is lawfully arrested witnon a warrant, he must be brought before a Justice of the Peace immediately)^ A person arrested under a warrant must be brought before a Justice ot t144 i Peace a£ the first possible opportunity, i.e., at the next session of the Justices jn the place from which the warrant is issued. The interval can rarely exceed a week, and would usually be less. When he is brought before the magistrate, he is formally charged with the offence accused against him, and pleads either guilty or not guilty. If he pleads not guilty, the prose cution at once have to open their case, and produce their evidence. If, by reason of the nature of the case, all the prosecution’s evidence cannot be produced at once, as is often tihe case, the magistrate may grant a remand, lie cannot grant, however, a remand for more than eight days at a time; that is to say, the man must again be brought before him in not less than eight days. When he is brought before the magistrate again, there may be yet another remand. The magistrate is thus able to control the action of the police, and he may refuse to grant another remand where the prose cution are not proceeding with proper expedition. When the case for the prosecution has been fully presented before the magistrate, he decides whether there is sufficient evidence to commit the man to trial or not. If there is not, he is of course released. The order of committal or of release termi nates wha£ corresponds in England to the process of “instruction” in con tinental law. It is possible that in a very complicated case there may be numerous remands; at the same time no such delay as those which occur under Persian procedure can take place in this country, because the charge must be preferred against the offender either in the warrant or (in cases where he has been arrested without warrant) at his first appearance before the magistrate; i.e., within a couple of days of arrest, and the magistrate (f .0 , a judicial authority) will have the offender brought before him at intervals of not more than eight days, and therefore can protect the accused against his being detained in prison unduly, pending the preparation of the case against him. 3. The above is a broad statement of the position in this country which should suffice for your general information and guidance. If, however, you should contemplate furnishing the Persian authorities with a detailed and authoritative statement in writing, you should so inform me in order that such a statement may be prepared in consultation with the competent authorities. 4. Since the Persian Minister of Justice based his reply to Sir Reginald Hoare’s oral representations on this subject upon the argument that Persian jurisprudence was founded on the Code Napoleon, I enclose a copy of a letter from the Legal Advisers to His Majesty’s Embassy in Paris. From this letter you will see that in France there exist in practice no substantial safeguards against the prolongation of the process of preliminary exami nation. ' j ' _* AS Enclosure to Serial No. (113). Sewell and Branch, Legal Advisers, to H. M.’s Embassy, Paris, to British Legation, Tehran, dated the 29th June 1933. In your letter of the 14th instant, No. 330/11/33, regarding the case of a British subject who has been arrested by the Persian Authorities, you asked us for information as to whether there was any provision under French law limiting /the length of the inquiry in a criminal matter. The Code Napoleon lays down no rules which afford any protection against deliberate delay in the preparation of the instruction in criminal cases. The Examining Magistrate alone decides the lines on which the investigation Should proceed and he is consequently free to continue the inquiry as long as he likes. We know of one particular case in which the investigation has lasted for over ten years, but of course in this case the accused was not under arrest. As regards the detention of the accused, this is dealt with by articles 113 and 114 of the Code d’Instruction Criminelle as modified by the law of the 7th February 1933. &gt; i 187(C) F&amp;PD146 f . - 1 four thousand, four hundred and sixty. Both these figures represent in creases on last year, but as the budget for last year was drawn up partly in Rials and partly in Sterling and Pehlevis, no exact comparison can be made. A comparative table is, however, attached for purposes of reference. ^ 3. As in previous years, the present budget gives only a partial insight into the financial position of the Persian Government. The very handsome windfall from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, for instance, which will during the current year exceed four million pounds, is not shown in the budget, but is paid into the Government’s foreign currency reserves held abroad. The total proceeds of the Road Tax do not appear in the budget, but certain percentages are allotted to particular departments and the balance remaining is devoted to actual expenditure on road construction and maintenance. A further important item excluded from the budget is the revenue from the Sugar and Tea Monopoly Tax, which is set aside for financing railway construction An account showing the state of the fund derived 'from the latter tax has, however, been separately reported to the Department of Overseas Trade by the Commercial Secretary in Overseas Trade (B) 127 of the 30th June last..! 4 . Under revenue, the yield from direct taxes in the present budget is estimated to fall by about two million Rials, and the tax on cultivated lands appearing under this heading is shown as only thirty-five million rials com pared with fifty million rials last year. Indirect taxes are higher by about nine and a half million rials, owing to an estimated income of eleven million rials from the Registration Tax and charges on transport. Receipts from monopolies are reduced owing to a diminution by almost one-half of the proceeds from the Opium Monopoly. Receipts from concessions, on the other hand, are higher, the income from the Caspian Sea Fisheries having increased from four and a half million rials to nine million rials. The revenue from the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs is estimated at four and a half million rials more than last year owing to increased proceeds from telegraphs and wireless.] 5 Under expenditure, the principal item is again the vote for the Ministry of War, which at some one hundred and eighty-four million Rials is higher than last year’s figure and represents more than a third of the totalTmdgetted expenditure. The estimate for the cost of road guards and police is increased by six and a half million Rials, whilst increases (h three and a half million rials are shown in the estimates for the Public Health Department and for the Ministry of Public Instruction. With the excep tion of a higher vote for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there are few other changes worthy of note. The items c ‘Credit for the reception of foieign visitors” (one and a half million rials) and “Unforeseen expenses (one and a half million rials) which appeared in last year’s budget have been eliminated J —- ; - - ' 1 6 . The following items from the Supplement published with the budget are of interest (a) An unspecified sum in Rials from the cash reserve brought for ward from previous budgets is to be allocated for the purchase of foreign exchange for Government requirements, as well as for the protection of foreign exchange rates from artificial fluctuations, and also when possible for the purchase of addi tional commercial export exchange which the authorised banks may deliver to the Government at the end of each economic year. Any nett losses resulting from the operation of this fund are to be made good from the remainder of the annual revenue balance of the year in which they are incurred. (b) The Ministry of Finance is authorised to redeem out of the country’s reserves the four hundred and ninety thousand Pounds advanced to the Persian Government by the British Government in the years 1291, 1292 and 1293 (1912, 1913 and 1914)1147 End. to S.

The original correspondence was exchanged between British representatives in Persia (chiefly the British Legation in Tehran), the Foreign Office, and the India Office. The correspondence concerns: the announcement by the Persian Government of laws, decrees, regulations, budgets, and other governmental communiqués, the texts of which were usually published in Persian newspapers (including
