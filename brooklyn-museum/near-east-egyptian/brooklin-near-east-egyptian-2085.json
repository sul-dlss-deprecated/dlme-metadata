The god is shown in a seated position with his feet resting upon a representation of a footrest. The throne upon which he was meant to sit was made separately and is missing. The god wears a tight-fitting cap, broad collar, and a long pleated skirt. In his two hands he holds the ends of a papyrus represented as unrolled across his lap. Inscribed on the roll are two lines of an unclear inscription which seems to give the name Imhotep. \r\n\r\nCondition: A black patina with splotches of cuprite here and there. Solid cast. Some pitting of surface and three spots of disease.", "medium": "Bronze", "dimensions": "4 1/2 x 1 3/16 x 2 5/16 in.
