We have again made full enquiries on your behalf, from practically every dealer in this country, and we have only been successful in obtaining one new model, Nickel Plated finish, price £2 11s.

The blocks have been purposely left on the long side, as it is naturally easier to cut them down than to add to their length.

I have asked Khan Sahib * Abdur Razzaq about the question of 1-116 Hon ’ 1:le tiAe Political Resident giving presents to -the shaikhs here when he tours on the Trucial Coast in March next* You asked me «bout it when I passed through Bahrain on my way to Basrah* The Residency -Agent's opinion is that it would create a good impression 5 if the Political Resident gave presents on his first tour; the most suitable, in fact, the only suitable, presents are rifles, shot-guns and binoculars in that order; ail presents should be the same unless it is wished to differentiate between the recipients; at least IOC rounds of ammunition should be given with a rifle or gun* It is better to give nothing than to depast from the standard here advaneed| If it is not possible or thought proper to give expensive presents to all the Shaikhs at this time^they may be given, as Major Alban opin^ed, in recognition of special service; and for this reason at the moment no presents are required* I agree with this opinion. B.Wakefield,Esquire,I.C, olitical Agent, Bahrain &lt;&gt;D.O. No. C/188 Dated the 9th February 1942, C * V/hile I was passing through Bushire on my way here you asked me to make inquiries about the presents which it would be suitable for you to give during your projected tour of the Trucial Coast in March# 2. Alban told me that it was by no means an invariable custom for the Political Resident to give presents to the Shaikhs, and he was opposed to the giving of presents becoming a normal or routine practice. He expressed the view that presents should be given primarily to signify recognition of special services rendered by particular individuals. He considered that the most suitable presents were rifles, field- glasses or pistols. 3. Later I had a chance of seeing Felly (who flew to Basra for a couple of days in a Royal Air Force machine for urgent dental treatment), and asked him to let me have his views after consulting the Residency Agent. I enclose a copy of his letter of 4th February. ! 4. I am in substantial agreement with what Felly writes - especially with his view that no present is better than a present which does not come up to the expected standard of munificence. A good present (if you are in a position to supply one l) has, I think, been earned by the Shaikh of Sharjah for his assistance in the activities of the Royal Air Force; and I am hoping, as I write, that Dubai will also qualify in the same manner for a reward. 5 . I don’t think I can usefully add anything further, as Alban and Khan Sahib Abdur Razzaq have much greater experience than I have of such matters.

Ml *t ht 331 The head farrash has never handled a rifle or gun and even if he is trained I think he would still he useless. / We have no material to clean t he arms and ammunition and so far we have been borrowing from the Port. I suggest that we ask the Superintendent of Police to send his Indian Havildar twice a month to the Agency, on the 1st and 15th of each month, to have the arms cleaned by the police guard under his supervision. I could hand over the guns in the morning and then lock up before the office closes. In this way there would be no fear of loss. 7e could pay the Havildar for his services. As he would be cleaning the Bushire Toshakhana arms and ammunition also, we could divide the payment fequally between Bahrain and Bushire. I think it would be not much inconvenience for the Havildar to attend to this twice a month, and when the arms have once been thoroughly cleaned and oiled he may then come only once a month say on the 1 st. Without his supervision the local police would not be able to clean them properly. The guns that were sent to Qatar were at least 10 times cleaned by the police and once by Mohsin, but still it appears the Defence Officer is complaining that the two of them which were returned to him by P.C.L. as unserviceable, were still rusted from some places. If A.P.A. agrees, papers may be submitted to P.A. for obtaining his approval to the Indian Havildar visiting the Agency twice or once a month for this purpose. 7&gt;/7 v P.A- MI &gt; (Ref&gt;7 .

Regular stock accounts are submitted to Bushire to keep the Residency updated on the number and range of articles being held on its behalf. The bulk of the file is concerned with the acquisition of new articles for the Bushire Toshakhana; the purchase of weapons and ammunition makes up almost the entirety of these purchases. The file therefore contains supporting correspondence, invoices, payment receipts, as well as export licenses and 'No Objection Certificates' to facilitate the export of weaponry. The principal suppliers are F P Baker and Company Limited and Suleman Omer and Company, Karachi.Also contained in the file is correspondence between British officials in the Persian Gulf; this correspondence is either concerned with new acquisitions for the Toshakhana, the transfer of articles between agencies, or making arrangements for presenting gifts to the various Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast. The main corresponding officials are the Political Agent, Bahrain (Charles Geoffrey Prior, Percy Gordon Loch, and Tom Hickinbotham); the Political Resident, Persian Gulf (Trenchard Craven Fowle and Hugh Weightman); the Secretary to the Political Resident; the Residency Agent, Sharjah; and the Trucial Coast Political Agent.Also within the file is an exchange from July 1941 (folios 249-251) between the Bahrain Political Agent and Charles Belgrave, Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, regarding arrangements for cleaning the weaponry stored in the Toshakhana.The Arabic language content consists of a couple of letters (folios 43-44 and folio 60) with English translation from the Bahrain Political Agent to the Residency Agent, Sharjah, as well as five letters (folios 45-50) from the Political Agent presenting gifts to various Trucial Coast Shaikhs; their translated replies in English can be found on folios 70-75.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Guns</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>F P Baker &amp; Company Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Ammunition</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arms sales</topic></subject><subject><topic>Gifts</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00015e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
