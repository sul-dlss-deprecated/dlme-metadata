Turks appear to have made sortie from Medina on August 3rd and were engaged by SHERIF ALI near GADIR rabel in a fight which lasted 28 hours. BENI OMAR then joined him, and part of the Turkish force, estimated by FEISAL at 5000 was lured to mountains where they were surrounded by combined forces of brothers and are without food or water. Turkish losses reported heavy. ALI captured an officer and some men, mules and arms. Details vague and numbers probably exaggerated. GADIR RABEL said to be 20 nlles from Liedina on Mecca road. UIvILEJ has surrendered to SEYYID GHARIB IBN BEDDAWI, brother Of MOHAMMED ALI. all JUHEINAH tribes reported ready and expecting arms and ammunition. We are trying to get into touch with BILLI and HQWEITAT Sheikhs. Wilson puts garrisons of WEJ and DHABAH at maximum of 150 men each. 700 more Turkish prisoners have reached SUEZ from Jeddah; also 102 of gunner prisoners from INDIA, latter having refused to join Sherif. Sherif (?) still pressing for aeroplanes and obviously fears Turkish advance (group undecipherable) Coast. Wilson hopes to (group undecipherable) to YAMBO shortly and discuss situation with at.t or FEISAL. KUNFIDAH question still unsettled. IDRISI refused to remove garrison, pleading loss of prestige, asking for at least 20 days extension : otherwise threatened cessation of offensive against Turks and hostilities against SHERIF. Meanwhile H.M.S. failed to remove IDRISI representatives owing to attitude of one Sheikh who wished to be Governor, and report of reinforcements strengthened their refusal.2 . ? ORGIGAN should have left yesterday for JEIZAK to try and make an arrangement. IDRISI men are reported to be plundering town, and H.M.3. has offered refuge to all who wish to leave. Wilson reports road between Mecca and Jeddah safe and urges encouragement of pilgrimage. Sherif fully alive to importance of ensuring Italians (Sic: pilgrimage’s ?) success. IEN RASHID, finding his position at SHAMLIYAH untenable owing to active hostility of ASLAM DAFFIR and EL Zayyad and inability to obtain supplies, is reported to have returned to HAIL (group undecipherable) his entry unopposed by IBN SADD’S lieutenants who have withdrawn to KASIM with much booty and a number of ABDAD and SHAWAYAH prisoners. Attitude of desert tribes in BASRA region satlsfac^ -tory. Nearly all SHAMLIYAH elements have come in and west of KHAMISIYAH DAFFIR and EL ZAYYaD are acting actively against AJAIMI. Those still standing out are Abdad $?) in with I3J RASHID and moved westward to desert of NEJEF a after lodging him and DHAIDAN EL HITHLAIN of AJMAN who with a few followers left with them and probably joined AJAIMI. Section of men who were with IBK RASHID have submitted to IBN TAWALAH and Sultan HISHLAIN of AJMAN has come to heel and undertook to remain obedient in neighbour- -hood of SAFWAN and protect Caravan routes?

The Turks are now dug in round some private houses . Rain and wind have ham &gt;ered operations which are now held up by shortage of shell. Pending arrival of consignment now en route from England, further supplies are being sent by the Sirdar. Faisul reports from Medina that the morale of the Arabs has been restored by the arrival of 7,000 rifles and supplies to such an extent that he contemplated renewal of attack on torn* Meanwhile the Turks concentrated at El Ula threaten (two groups undecipherable). Details very vague as all reports are, and we cannot identify places. Sheikh Oharib has taken Urn Lejj for Sherif T s and reports all Juheina tribe are ready to join in as soon as they get arms. The Turks have had to send Arab troops from Medina back to Syria as unreliable and replace them by smaller number of Turks drawn from all units in Syria. Guns, camps and camels have been sent, a few even from Sinai, to the Hejas, railway apparently working as usual, and Sherif urges us to (two groups undecipherable) advance via Yambo on Mecca. Sherif replied by capture of Yambo and asked for aeroplane or seaplane demonstration there to surprise the Turks. He offered to arrange base for half squadron R.E.C. at Yambo. The Turks seem to have advanced somewhere on 3rd August and were met by Sheriff Ali; in a running fight of 28 hours he took an officer, some men, mules and arms and states that the Turks lost heavily. He was joined by two other tribes and he led part of the Turkish force into the desert, where it seems to be surrounded without food or water by the combined forces (words ommitted) cut it an once.

I have, Ac., (Signed) A. H. McMahon The Right Honourable Sir E. Grey, Bart., M.PSecret. GOVERNOR GENERAL'S OFFICE, E R K 0 W I T. July 8til, 1916. Sir:- I have the honour to transmit the copy of a report received from Colonel C.E.Wilson on the subject of his visit to Jeddah. The substance of Colonel Wilson's recommendations has been already telegraphed to you and I have expressed the opinion that his proposal regarding the despatch to Jeddah of a British Representative is sound and should be acted upon without delay. I take this opportunity to recapitulate the salient points of my recent telegrams connected with the revolt in the Hedjaz. 1. The immediate despatch of all foodstuffs required by the Sherif is imperative if the latter is to keep his Arab levies in the field, and the success of the Sherif's movement be not gravely prejudiced. 2. The monthly subsidies in cash and kind asked for by the Sherif should be granted. This is all the more necessary if His Majesty's Government is not in a posi tion to arrange for a military diversion against the Turkish forces in Syria and elsewhere, nor to offer the Sherif a suitable expeditionary force for service in Arabia. 3. The training of the 'New' Arab army should be carried out in the territory of the Sherif at Jeddah and all war material that v/e can provide and the Arab ex- prisoners and personnel required for the organisation of lis Excellency The High Commissioner, Cairo. thesethese troops, should he sent to that port. 4. I assume that the official announcement hy His Majesty's Government regarding the revolt is to pend its favourable development, and the issue hy the Sherif of his formal proclamation to the Moslem World. A draft of the latter proclamation, which I have seen, appears to me to strike the correct note in the emphasis laid on the territorial independence of the Arah State and hostility to the Committee of Union and Progress. The Pan-Ottoman policy of the latter is evidently approved hy important sections of Moslem opinion in India and elsewhere: and thd particulars of the assistance rendered hy the British Government to the Arabs will certainly he advertised hy our enemies. We should therefore, I consider, seize this opportunity openly to espouse the Arabs cause, and at the same time to institute throughout our Moslem possessions an uncompromising anti-Ottoman propaganda, based on the new conditions obtaining in the Redjaz, and the Sherif’s refutation of the spiritual claims of the Ottoman Sultanate. It is needless to point out that the failure of the Sherif's movement would he disastrous to our prestige and would gravely complicate our future relations with Mohammedan peoples: such assistance consequently, as the Sherif requires from us, should he given him without stint and despatched with the least possible delay. I have, &amp;c., REGINALD WINGATE. General. Governor General of Sudan.The Grand Sherif appears to have started his revolt without sufficient preparation and somewhat prematurely; he has entered into a struggle which is taxing his pov/ers to a high degree and intrigue amongst his own people, which appears to he rampant, does not tend to make matters easier for him. I do not however feel much douht as to his ultimate success, hut to ensure this he must he kept v/ell supplied with food-stuffs of which he is in urgent need. There appears to have been sane delay in forwarding food-stuffs to the Sherif and one serious error as to amounts; should any serious set-hack to his forces occur at Medina the Sherif will more than probably try to put the blame on the British Government, ov/ing to supplies not being available when he expected them. The serious ness of the consequences to the British Government should the present Hed^az revolt fail is too patent to call for remark. To facilitate matters of supply and communications between His Majesty's Government and the Sherif, I am strongly of opinion that a senior British officer or official who knows some Arabic and understands Arabs should be appointed without loss of time to be the representative of the British Government with the Sherif, having his residence at Jeddah. This representative should not be termed a consul but a special British envoy or given sane similar status, he should have full power to deal with questions as they arise on lines which would | require defining. While I consider that such an envoy should receive his appointment direct from His Majesty's Government, therebythereljy greatly strengthening his hands, I do not propose that he should comnuYticate direct with the Foreign Office, hut he under the inmediate orders of the High Official v/ho may he in charge of the military and political affairs of the bherif; these duties, in my opinion, must oo run hy one ofiicial, it being almost impossible to separate the military operations from the political side, such a division of responsibility must, 1 think, lead to confusion and it would presumably entail two British representatives at Jeddah entirely independent of each other. The envoy would require the following staff to begin with: 1. A member of the consular service v/ho could eventually fill the position of British consul at Jeddah, which, after the war, will, I imagine, become a port of considerable importance. 2. A British officer or official v/ho knows Arabic and has had previous experience with Arabs. 3. A British doctor. 4. A really capable and energetic Moslem doctor who has experience of the duties of Medical Officer of Health, v/ho could be usefully employed to organise sanitary services &amp;c., at Jeddah; under existing conditions Jeddah runs a very good chance of being visited by an epidemic of cholera, plague, typhoid, or some such disease. 5. At least two really capable senior clerks and intelligence agents such as Hussein Effendi Ruhi and Ibrahim Bey Dimitri of the Sudan Civil Service. Until the British consulate at Jeddah has been overhauled and put into a sanitary and habitable condition, the Envoy and his staff will have to live on a ship in the harbour and a small launch drav/ing not more than 2£ ft. will be necessary. TheThe existing method of conminication with the Sherif would appear to he inadequate, it is certainly unsatisfactory, and unless there is some permanent British representative at Jeddah the present confusion of the continual requests for supplies &amp;c., v/ill con tinue. It is somewhat difficult to know at present definitely whether a sudden request for supplies is an entirely new order or already included in a previous demand. A representative would he able to keep a record of and sift such demands settling any doubtful points on the spot. There appears to he a very real fear of a shortage of foodstuffs; Just before I left Jeddah Sheikh Mohanmed bin Oreyfan informed me that a sheikh Just arrived from Medina had said that the ration issued to the Arab forces round Medina was one sheen for each seven men every two days without any rice,flour,&amp;c.,and also - what would appear to be a somewhat serious point - that a large number of Arabs were still with the Turkish Medina force and that others had left Sherif Faisal because they got food with the Turks and \ little with the Arabs. As far as I can gather the Sherif expects the British Government to supply the whole of his force in the Hedjaz and possibly part of the population with food-stuffs. If the Sherif*s view is correct, the urgency of getting large quantities of supplies ready at once is clearly indicated and of the first importance; further demands for munitions of war may also be expect ed. I have no knowledge as to what extent the British Government encouraged the Shcrif to revolt nor as to how far it is committed, but it is obvious that if any responsibilityresponsibility has been incurred the Sherif should receive the fullest possible support now, half measures may easily mean disaster and future trouble. Should a British representative be appointed, as recoranended above, I suggest that supplies should be collected at Jeddah, where he would issue them as required, and not sent to Port Sudan Which would entail an extra loading and unloading; should there be no such representa tive Port Sudan as a supply depot is preferable to Suez as the Sherif’s dhows could be utilized for transport purposes. If the depot is at Jeddah, a trained store keeper and clerk will be necessary. Two cargo steamers of about 3000 tons or at least one should be detailed at once for transport of supplies work only. The Sherif appears at present anyhow to be inclined to resent any British interference, though this is possibly due to his fear that the Arabs should think that they had exchanged British for Turkish rule &amp;c., and the general situation requires careful handling owing to the intrigues among the Sherif’s own people. Captain Cornwallis informed me that when he was ashore with Sherif Paruki he looked into a cafe now used as a general hospital and although he was only inside a matter of seconds Sherif Paruki was furious at his enter ing the place at all. Again one evening Sherif Paruki informed Captain Cornwallis that instructions had been received from the Sherif to the effect that no one was allowed ashore and that comnunications were to be carried on in writing. Captain Cornwallis and I refused to accept such an order unless we received it in writing from the Sherif. After— Yt After a certain amount of argument it was agreed that Captain Cornwallis the Senior Naval Officer and myself could go ashore when necessary on business; we ascer- tained afterwards, and I have no reason to doubt its truth that oherif Faruki had enlarged on the Grand Sherif's orders on his own account. All that the Sherif wished was that parties from the ships etc. should not land; considering the state of Jeddah and the fact that Ramadan had begun, I did not consider that any objection could be taken to this, if the Sherif considered that there was any chance of a disturbance. To allow of no British intervention at all would, I submit, be an impossible line to follow. The British Government should insist on an agent as recommended above being at Jeddah and on its being kept fully informed through him as to all movements and intentions of the Sherif’s forces and on the Sherif’s taking advice should such be deemed necessary, more particularly with regard to the administration of Jeddah. The British Agent would take no active part in Jeddah administration but would give his advice as occasion arose The Grand Gherif should be instructed (or requested) to inform his local representatives at Jeddah that in regard to Quarantine, Sanitary and such like matters they should consult freely and accept the advice of the British Agent. Great care must of course be taken in so wording such requests to the Grand Sherif as to allay any exciting fears that the British Government intend to take over the administration of Jeddah entirely and actively interfere with the administration of the Hedjaz, to do either, especiallyespecially at present, would be a great mistake politically and that we have no such intention should be made clear to the Grand Sherif. Assuming that the Grand Sherif is informed on the lines indicated above, on the grounds that the British Government must insist . in the Sherif’s own interests - that Jeddah should be properly run and the advice of its Agent taken, the method of getting things done might well be left to the latter who will not have an easy problem to solve and whose position will not be a ’•bed of roses'. It might usefully be pointed out to the Grand Sherif that should an epidemic occur in Jeddah, the fact will be proclaimed and the Pilgrimage and ordinary shipping and trade intercourse - which is so much desired by him - will be greatly interfered with. I am inclined to go so far as to recommend offering the Sherif to supply him with a complete Quarantine and town Sanitation Service Staff as may be required who would of course be all Moslems. The British Government has the whip hand over the Sherif as he probably could not exist without money or supplies, advantage should therefore be taken now, tact fully but firmly of the existing situation to make a start in introducing British influence on the lines - presumably already roughly decided on - along which British relations with the Sherif*8 Government will run in the future after the war. As regards the Howitzer Batteries and other Artillery which I understand is to be supplied, the Personnel for which is to be provided by Sherif Faruki fromfro^n Arab prisoners, I suggest that these guns complete should be sent to Jeddah and the Personnel trained there instead of in Egypt for political reasons.

Brief resumd of . . „ recent events in Hedjaz is as follows. Strict patrol of Bed Sea Arab ports has been in operation since May 15th in accordance with Sheriff’s programme. High Commissioner has supplied Sheriff with arms and ammunition, stores, and large sums of money. Outbreak was to commence on June 4th at Medina* other places following—under Sheriff at Mecca, under Sheriff’s Naib at Jeddah and under Sheriff’s son at Taif. Railway was to be broken as far as Medinsalih. Revolt is genuine and inevitable in Cairo’s opinion, but Arabs are inadequately prepared both in organisation and armed forces and have no knowledge of modern warfare, and have left too much to luck. Success will depend on their overwhelming numbers. Specially secret. Operations at Jeddah commenced on June 9th with co-operation of His Majesty’s ships “ Hardinge ” and “ Pox ” which shelled Turkish entrenced positions north of town of Jeddah. Commander of “ Fox ” is endeavouring to send Turkish Commandant invitation to surrender to British men-of-war. We have informed Secretary of State for India of our grave concern over this action which seems direct violation of public announce ment and have asked him to suppress intelligence. Pending developments, question of this year’s Hajj is held in suspense. All Harb Ateida Juheinaz and smaller tribes are with Sheriff according to Sheriff’s messenger who met Cairo’s representatives. Bin Saud was neutral. Bin Rashid powerless, and Imam was doing nothing. Messenger also asserts that all Anazeh will rise as soon as Hedjaz revolts.

He asks for assistance of 2000 Egyptian troops to assist in capture of Medina and for further 10,000 to be held in readiness. It is impossible to meet this request and I must tell him so* Bhereef is of course anxious to take Medina as soon as possible in order to complete possession cf Hedjaz and be in a position to announce success of his move ment . On the other hand if Turks do hide to send iorce to Medina they would probably re-capture it, but problem of advance to Mecca is very much more difficult. In these circumstances relief of Medina by Turks would have less effect on Shereef 1 s prestige than its re-capture after Shereef had taken it and advertised fact.

Political Hesident, Aden To, The Secretary to the Government of India, foreign and Political Department, Simla, Sir, X have the honour to forward herewith a report. with connected papers by Captain L«B,Turton, K.N, The main points in the report were conveyed to you in my telegram Ho • 2214 p. dated 30th June 1916, solely against the Turks and is prepared to assist the Sheriff even to the point of supporting him fier the Caliphate, Ee would, however, resent any claim by the Sheriff to the ownership of any parts of ASXR, His friendly letter to the Sheriff, which was not easily secured, is an eam^t of his desire for friendly oo-oper- Xmam but, in common with most decent Arabs, he regards him as a dishonest and despicable ruler. The Imam^ collection of troops on the Xdrisi's soutnem border may be connected with the withdrawal of his troops from the B&amp;HAN border, ' S ay ad Mustapha states he hae information thet the Imam is now mobilising to attack the Idrisi. If so the combined As far as can be judged, the Idrisi is working ation. 3. The Xdrisi is not actively hostile to the forcesforc«s to be engaged by the latter on hie southern border may be of a Texy formidable character* He assures ae .that there Is no doubt that the Ixaaa has definitely throen in his lot with the Turks, and he is certain that he will not join the Arabian movement* « Z have irapreased on him again the necessity for refraining from giving him any cause of offence and I am assured that the Idrimi will act only on the defensive against him* t 4 * It appears to me that we are somewhat con cerned in trying to prevent the Turks now at LAHBJ from joining the Turkish-Imamie forces on the Idrisi border; ae - well ae in assisting the Idrisi with ammunition and with our H&amp;vy* 5, As regards the Hashid and B&amp;khil, the Idris 1 intimates, through Sayad Mustapha, that they will not be asked to oooperate unless we give our approval to their eaqployment * He expects us to find a pecuniary reward for them if they are called upon,but this will not be paid until after services rendered. They are* as he says, soldiers of fortune and are independent* They threw off all allegiance to the Imam when he made terns with the Turks. It is clear that they are not now Imam tribes, nor in any way under the Imam's influence* They are on the « contrary in very friendly relations with the Idrisi and bitterly anti-Turk, although they are ZAIBIS* In the event of any large attack against the Idrisi, the Hashid and Bakhil would be an invaluable asset to him, as they would be in another way when the Idrisi attack Loheiya But he does not require their assistance in his Northern operations* nor does he wish to jsmploy them inside what he considers as his territory. It seems inevitable that they will eventually be required, c and when the need arises there may be no time for bargaininiand coming to tenne* Z therefore request that I may be authorised to aek the Idrisi to discover their vie** and requirements so that the necessary agreement may be arrive* at, 6 « A great deal more ammunition will be re quired by the Idrisi. 1 am informed by Say ad Mustapha that he was specially deputed by him to represent the extreme urgency of his requirements, The matter of most immediate importance is the early supply of the gun ammunition, as X have previously re presented, 7 ive million rounds of Le Gras rifle ammunition in addi tion to that already ordered and two million rounds of Wetterli ammunition for the use of the Idrisi and our stipendiaries will be required. These will be stored here and issued as circumstances demand* 7 , Captain Turtoa tells me that he was very favourably impressed by the personality of the Idrisi, and considers that it is his intention^ to act with per fect sincerity. He also tells me that he has received most loyal assist ance fromSayad Mustapha, she,though unfortunately not yet recovered from his illness, returned to ^jesan in order to assist in obtaining a favourable and definite answer from the Idrisi, and who has accompanied him here to see me. 8 # I have the honour to invite attention to Captain Turton’s favourable remarks on the assistance rendered to him by Lieut. Haider, H.N.V.H. g. Captain Turton has taken infinite pains to make his mission a success. He has displayed great tact and firmness and it is due to this that so clear anan understanding of the Idris 1 * intentions has been gained* I hare the honour to oe 9 Sir, Your most obedient servant.

He was however hurt that the Sheriff had not informed him of his intentions* The Sheriff had commenced brilliantly out the enemy was close to his hand and he was assisted by British ships* The loss of the Kejaz would rankle with the Turks who might be expected to make a big counter- attack,when the Sheriff might get into difficulties* As to boundaries, the Sheriff could not deny that all Asir, including Abha, its capital,was the idrin^s legi timate sphere. But if the Sheriff wished to oust the lurks from Kunfida,Mahail and Abha the Idrisi would acquisce,re lying on the just arbitration of the British Government. (2) • The Imam Said to be collecting troops (has he had time to hear of Idrisi’s movements ?) presumably to hold up some of idrisi’s army. Absolutely unreliable: and any idea of obtaining his cooperation is impractical. He is hand and glove with the Turks. (b). Hgshid &amp; Baki l* There is no question of the idrisi’s control over them.

(1) Absolute times, dates, and names of points of attack to the northward intended by your Excellency so near as it is possible to give them, and what assistance you may re quire from ships and when that assistance will be required. If you could arrange your attack to tak«- place after 9 days 1.e., 9th July, I consider that would be desirable. ( 2 ) Whether you will or will not v/rite a letter to the She riff assuring him nnmvring b-v * 1 of your friendly cooperation against the Turks. I have received a telegram that the She riff has proclaimed the indepenjee of the Hejaz and that the Hejaz aad thM the Hajas is now ready to receive pilgrims. ( 3 ) With regard to the tribes of Has^hid and Bacblill, can yss you delay the question of their cooperation until after the capture of Kunfida, Abha, and Loheiha. Tnis would be advis able if it can be arranged: possibly it might be preferacle to do without them altogether till Imam comes in.

I would suggest that the attack on Loheiha should be on 9^ July also, so as to coincide with that on Kunfida. (5) Your definite viewjef as to the steps you think that the Imara in likely to take under present conditions. (6) In the event of Imara remaining friendly to the Turks what are your intentions as regards Sania and tribes under the control of the Imam. I wish to add the final remar-Ks . I fully realise the extreme difficulties of communicatien and time wasted thereby which prevents a rapid offensive ac tion on your part but I should like to point out that it is now 16 days since you agreed to take an immediate offensive action against the Turks and that there is nothing yet to record. Ky object oc in mentioning this is my fear lest the opportunity created by the Sheriff*s action should ce lost. The use of H.M f s ships for conveying messages and offi cials between various parte of your coast, with a view to facilitating your communication has been offered but no use has yet been made of this offer and it must be borne in mind as I have previously pointed out, that due warning must oe given. Should you find it convenient, we shall be willing to take charge of your Turkish prisoners and convey them to Egypt, as has been done in the case oi tne sneriff. In conclusion I beg to assure your Excellency that we have the fullest confidence in you and that the Britisn Gov ernment is convinced of your triendliness and loyalty. Our commom objective is to eject the Turk from Arabia for all times and to assure a lasting peace and prosperity to your countries.

We have al ready assured you of its reality, which has been our desire for many years. But we only received the news of the Sheriff *s ac tion 16 days ago from your Excellency and as you know, our - troops are Arabs whom we must, owing to the well known condi tion of the Arabs, collect from direction. ^ We have actually taken 8 days in calling them up from different districts to our council and in explaining to them the operations required of them and that these operations are t the culminating point of many years. This took 8 days. They then began to prepare for the jour ney for this attack; some of them have already proceeded to the In ortheradistrict and all the rest will have begun their march by Thursday. Had we had even a month’s notice of tne Sheriff’s real in tentions before he moved, we could have made the necessary dis- positione for the whole attack to take place simultaneously. As it is affairs, by Allah’s will, proceed as well as possible. With regard to Kunfida, it is a matter of the greatest ease and after our soldiers have collected at Birk, there will be no difficulty in attaining our object. As these operations fcaae: are conducted by Arabs, it is im possible to giTe a definite day and hour but providing that - ships continue to visit Gizan we will inform them oi the time appointed for the attack. We may send men and supplies by the'by the ships for speed of communication. ( As regards the letter to the Sheriff, we concur in this for the sake of hsLs final success in operations which we assuredly reckon as the fcKik height of success for us, and send you the letter herewith. As for the tribes of Hashid and Bakill, we received yester day a letter from Sheikh Kasir Mabkhut stating that they are un der my orders and I propose writing to him asking that either he or one of the trusted men should attend here, when we will discuss affairs with nim and inform you. These tribes, as I have already informed you, are independent, ovfing allegiance neitner to the Imam Yehia or anyone else. They are soldiers seeking their livelihood wherever they may find fit. For the present, v/e have turned our faces to the horth, which is the most useful to the Sheriff for communications and for help should the Turks undertake a big offensive against him in the future. This is tne one direction for meeting the enengt# of the present time. ** With regard to the Imam Yehia, we have previously made N a detailed report to the Government : it will now suffice if Saiyid Mustafa informs you verbally of my mxi views. V/e nave received information that he is collecting troops: it would seem that his object is to hinder our offensive and to prevent the advance of all our forces by necessitating the detailing of some to watch him. In conclusion we tnank to you and the Government ior your confidence in us•The Saiyid El Idriei To, Sheriff Hussein Ali, Amir of Mecca. After ijost cordial greetings, I praise tne one God for you. There has gone fffom me the son of Sheikh Ifohammed Areifan, bearing an answer to your letter.

With reference to the conclusion on this subject reached at the previous meeting (Conclusion 6, War Committee Paper, W.C. 53), the War Committee had before them telegrams Nos. 559 and 560, dated the 10th July, from Sir H. McMahon, the High Commissioner of Egypt, explaining that the sum of 125,0001 which he had asked for for the assistance of the Sherif, was required not only to pay and feed the Sherif s forces, and to keep these forces in the field, as well as friendly tribes on which the success of the revolt depends, but also to replace the former Turkish subsidies which included the Sherit s personal subsidy, sums for the upkeep of shrines in the towns of Mecca and Medina, cost of the administration of Jeddah, and subsidies to tribes for the safety of pilgrim routes. As the whjle of this burden, in addition to the expenses of the war, was now thrown on the Sherif at a rpoment when the stoppage ot the trade and the pd^rimage have closed the usual sources of income, Sir H. McMahon had earnestly pressed for sanction of the full amount, though only for the next four months, which will be of a very critical nature. The War Committee approved the grant of 125,000/,. a month for the next four months, on the understanding that the Egyptian Government will make the payment and that we will reimburse them. 3. The War Committee also considered the recommendation from Sir H. McMahon that British officers should be sent to organise the sanitary services at Jeddah, with the further obiect of actum aa a channel of communication with the Sherif, and securmg good cona tions for the pilgrimage. The War Committee saw no objection to this proposal, more especially as the officers would not be employed on military service. 4.

Mr. Chamberlain COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE, 2, Whitehall Gardens, London, S.W. The Prime Minister asked me to inquire whether any action has as yet been taken in regard to the enclosed Conclusion of the War Committee on July 6th. I think the Prime Minister’s reason for asking this is that Sir Mark Sykes has represented that it is urgent to adopt a pro-Arab policy in all parts of the Middle East. You will remember that Sir Mark Sykes* defin ition of such a policy was in the following terms 'Tov.ards all Arabs, whatever their condition, whether in dependent allies as Ibn Saud and the Sherif, inhabitants of protectorates, spheres of influence, vassal states, we should show ourselves as pro-Arabs, and that wherever we are on Arab soil that we are going to back Arab lang uage and Arab race, and that we shall protect or support Arabs against external oppression by force as much as we are able, and from alien exploitation. That where we govern we shall employ Arabs in the administration where we do not employ Englishmen, and that where we employ Arabs we intend to give them the executive authority of their rank, and that we do not recognise any social dis tinction between an Englishman and an Arab of the same rank, and further that we do not intend to introduce the idea of a ruling race.' Sir Mark Sykes* latest suggestion is that this policy ought to be adopted and conveyed in the form of an identical circular instruction to the officers who are responsible for the various isolated fields of political activity in the Middle A similar communication has been addressed to Lord Gre f , . East ^gust 2, 19167. The War Committee heard the views of Sir Mark. Sykes on the-question of Policy in the Middle East. Sir Mark Sykes strongly urged the following action for the most effective prosecution of the war :— (a.) That His Majesty’s Government should give the Egyptian Government instructions in such a form as to stimulate the activity and energy of the civil administration with a view to increasing the moral and material resources of the army in Egypt; (6.) That the British Government should definitely adopt a con sistent pro-Arab policy in all parts of the Middle East, and in execution of this policy that Sir Percy Cox should be appointed High Commissioner of Eastern Arabia, Hadramaut, and Aden, and should be charged directly under the Foreign Office instead of under the Indian Government, as at present, with all negotiations with the Arab tribes with which we have relations from Aden to Mesopotamia inclusive. Under this proposal the politma relations with the north side of the Persian Gulf would remain in the hands of the Indian Government the line of delimitation being in the region of the line Moham- merah—Ahwaz. It was arranged that this latter proposal should be discussed forthwith between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and .he Secretary of State for India, with the assistance of Lord Curzon and Lord Hardinge of Penshurst.r 1 iF /J J Jr.. n.T.n.

The War Committee had under consideration a number of Memoranda prepared by the General Staff, in the India Office and in the Committee of Imperial Defence by Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Mark Sykes, Bart., M.P., on the subject of the Arab revolt, and the military and political situation created thereby. On the recom mendation of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, the Committee decided that the following naval and military measures should be taken at once to support the Arab movement: — (i.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should direct the Commander-in-Chief in Egypt to make all possible preparation for the occupation of El Arish and Akaba, since a force established at these places would directly threaten the Turkish communication between Syria and the Hejaz, and would encourage the Syrian Arabs, while at the same time effectively defending the Eastern Frontier of Egypt. It is unlikely that the climatic conditions will admit of these operations being undertaken before October, and their practicability must then be considered in the light of the situation at that time. (ii.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should direct the Commander-in-Chief in Egypt to push on at once with the construction of the railway at Katia, and should make all preparations for its extension to El Arish as quickly as possible. (iii.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Admiralty should give instructions to the Commander-in-Chief in Egypt and the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, respectively, to concert plans for the occupa tion of Akaba. (iv.) The Admiralty should direct the Naval Commander-in- Chief, East Indies Station, to prevent, by means of naval patrols, the Turks from using the Bed Sea from Hodeida to Lith, if this is not already being done. (v.) The India Office should direct the Besident at Aden to endeavour to obtain the co-operation of the Imam in preventing the withdrawal of the three Turkish Divi sions now in Asir and Yemen. It is understood that the co-operation of the Idrissi has already been secured. (vi.) The India Office should draw up a scheme for a minor opera tion to drive back the Turkish outposts in the vicinity of Aden, and should examine what would be the requirements in material and personnel for carrying it out. After referring their scheme to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff they should report to the War Committee, (vii.) The Admiralty and General Staff should continue and develop the naval and military measures designed to lead the enemy to fear a landing at Alexandretta or Smyrna.(mu.) 1 le v ar Office should take steps to meet the probable demands^ of the Idrissi and the Sherif for arms and ammunition as far as our requirements elsewhere permit. tt- A/ rhe ^ Committee had before them a telegram from the High Commissioner in Egypt, dated the 30th June, urging that the ohent should be assisted for the next four months to the extent of i^OOOL a month (the full extent of his demands), by the end of which time his future needs will be better known to us. The War Committee consider that this amount is excessive or the puipose of paying and feeding the Sherif’s forces and friendly tubes. fhey understand, however, from Brigadier- General Clayton, the Director of Military Intelligence at Cairo, who vas piesent at this discussion, that the larger sum may include an allowance to replace the subsidy formerly paid to the Sherif by the lurkish Government for the maintenance and protection of the Holy Places, and the Committee recognise tnat it will be necessary for us to make this good to the Sherif. The War Committee decided that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, assisted by Brigadier-General Clayton, and in concert with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, should prepare a telegram to the High Commissioner in Egypt in the sense that 50,000/. a month appears sufficient for the purposes mentioned in his telegram, namely, to pay and feed the Sherif’s forces and the friendly tribes, and that he is authorised to incur a total expenditure up to this sum, whether in the form of subsidies or supplies, as he thinks fit; and that if a further sum is required for the maintenance of the Holy Places, the British Government will be willing to consider an additional allowance. 7. The War Committee heard the views of Sir Mark Sykes on the question of Policy in the Middle East. Sir Mark Sykes strongly urged the following action for the most effective prosecution of the war :— (a.) That His Majesty’s Government should give the Egyptian Government instructions in such a form as to stimulate the activity and energy of the civil administration with a view to increasing the moral and material resources of the army in Egypt; (?&gt;.)

No RET. r' h G.-73. j 2739 • • /;* THE ARAB 34 Precis op Evidence of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Mark Sykes, Bart. M.P., at a Meeting (see Paper W. C.-53) of the War Committee held at 10, Downing Street, on July 6, 1916. I DEAL only with political administration : we require two decisions, (1) on general policy towards the Arabs ; (2) on the means of carrying it out. In dealing with the Asiatic Arabs we have to deal with people divided by religion, social custom, economic condition, but bound by one common language and an intense sense of race or breed. I dealt in some detail with this aspect of the problem in December. If we are to work the Arabs for what they are worth, 1 am strongly of opinion that we should adopt a definite policy towards them which should permeate all our dealings with them. 1 should put it in words as follows:— “ Towards all Arabs, whatever their condition, whether independent allies, as Ibn Sand and the Shereef, inhabitants of protectorates, spheres of influence, vassal States, we should show ourselves as pro-Arabs, and that wherever we are on Arab soil that we are going to back Arab language and Arab race, and that we shall protect or support Arabs against external oppression by force as much as we are able, and from alien exploitation. That where we govern we shall employ Arabs in the administration where we do not employ Englishmen, and that where we employ Arabs we intend to give them the executive authority of their rank, and that we do not recognise any social distinction between an Englishman and an Arab of the same rank, and, further, that we do not intend to introduce the idea of a ruling race.” I suggest we should obtain the concurrence of the French to this policy, and an agreement that such policy is to be mutual in our respective spheres. I have discussed this matter with M. Picot, and he not only agrees with it, but tells me he will urge it upon his Government. What I want to make clear is that in my opinion Arabs cannot be run on the lines of “ the white man’s burden.” The Arabs have many faults and failings, but they have physique, fire, and a nimbleness of mind and a sense of breed which makes it impossible to adopt the white versus coloured attitude towards them. I do not recommend that this policy be made public, or that we commit ourselves by pledges or undertakings to the Arabs, but that if His Majesty’s Government sees fit to adopt this policy, that it be translated into action by instructions to our officers and reorganisation and co-ordination of the political service in those regions where we are in contact with the Arabs. The second matter in regard to political policy is the revitalisation of the British in the area mentioned. Before going any further I should like to pay tribute both to Sir H. McMahon and Sir Percy Cox. I am not making a compliment when I say that I think that, considering the circumstances, they have both done extraordinarily well. I say that with the same meaning and purpose that I should say it in private conversa tion, and not as a formal observation in a report. And what I am going to say has no reflection on either of them in both the spheres for which they are responsible. With regard to Egypt, I am strongly of opinion that Sir H. McMahon requires help in the way of instructions. The civil policy in Egypt since the beginning of the war has been “ Business as usual.” There has been a steady effort to cany on the administration as though very little were afoot, with the result that people have gone in for junketing, entertainment, and have drifted into a tendency to let things slide. This has produced a deadening of energy and a defensive or passive atmosphei e in the civilian, and reacts on the military and on the natives themselves. Moreo\er, the death of Lord Kitchener is a great event in Egypt. Native and civil Biitish opinion was that Sir H. McMahon was only a temporary holder of the position,^ and that Eoid Kitchener was coming back. Lord Kitchener was a link with Loid Ciomei, Goidon, and the early years of energy and vitality, and the tradition of iiails and scorpions forthe idle or incompetent; so long as he was a potential force we could drift without danger, now that he has gone we depend entirely on ourselves. If His Majesty’s Government would deal with this situation I think that Sir H. McMahon should be given instructions informing him that His Majesty’s Government had the highest appreciation of the work he has done hitherto, and then proceeding inform him that they have decided that civilian Egypt must be put on a war footir^&gt; that everything in the civil administration must be subordinated to military operation that the sports, entertainments, and display of any kind is to be discountenanced, and that all resources of energy and material are to be concentrated on the prosecution of the war, and that the High Commissioner is to show himself ruthless in dealing with any officials who show want of energy. If such instructions could be conveyed as part of a potential military action I believe that the Egyptian atmosphere would be changed, f and that the actual military value of the troops in Egypt would be materially increased, that we should increase our supplies of labour, food, material, and mechanical resources threefold, and that the natives would begin to respect us. So much for Egypt. I now come to the Gulf and Mesopotamia and the political work of Sir Percy Cox. This is the most difficult thing I have to say ; it is what I have felt for over a year, and the more I have seen and read the more strongly am I convinced of what I am about to say, and that is that the Government of India is incapable of handling the Arab question. In saying this I make no reflection on the Government of India. Circumstances, atmosphere, and tradition conspire to make the thing as it is. For reasons that need not be recited the Indian Moslems are pro-Turk, and when I say pro-Turk I do not mean sentimentally pro-Turk, in the sense that some English people are pro-Turk, in admiring the sturdy and picturesque qualities of the Anatolian peasant; the Indian Moslems who count in India are pro-Committee, they want to see Turkey a strong military Power counting in the counsels of Europe. Moreover, the British officials in India are themselves influenced by this pro-Turkish atmosphere and unconsciously or subconsciously sympathise with it. Consequently, anything which is fundamentally anti-Turkish—that is, anti-Committee—is anti pathetic to the Indian Government. The Arab movement, as such, is disliked in India just as Kaimil Pasha was disliked and Enver is admired. This fundamental influence is supplemented by another. The Indian Government is accustomed to treat affairs | relating to natives and native governments from a social and political standpoint as regards Englishmen and natives, based on a colour line and on dominion, in a way which is utterly 7 - alien to Arabs and Arabian questions. Moreover, there is an absolute antipathy between the Indian and the Arab, and anyone who tries to deal with Arabs ^ on Anglo-Indian lines will jar on the Arab at every turn. Now all these things influence the political staff in Mesopotamia. They temper the wind as best they can, but so long as they depend upon India for control, promo tion, and approval, so long -will our whole Arabian policy be discordant or unreal. The combined effect of these influences is subtle but powerful. It is working on three lines—Moslem India is openly anti-Arab and pro-Committee of Union and Progress ; Indian policy is deferential to Moslem view T s ; Indian administration is based p on Indian methods and traditions, which means the importation of Indian law, Indian lawyers, and Indian personnel, and the training and payment of such native personnel as exists on Indian traditions—which must end in discontent and restlessness among the Arabs. This will be aggravated by the introduction of Indian domestic and social habits, and the colour line. Lastly, it is useless to ignore the jealousy which subsists between Simla and Cairo. This is an old long-standing feud, but real nevertheless ; a cause of constant irritation, aggravated by climatic conditions which leads to want of co-operation and enthusiasm. f The Mesopotamian political staff is excellent. I cannot speak too highly of Sir Percy Cox’s work. He has studied the country and learnt much ; but it will never be free so long as it depends upon Simla. The only way to unity aud co-ordination that is discernible is to place the political affairs of Mesopotamia, Aden, and Muscat directly under the Foreign Office, London, and appoint Sir Percy Cox as High Commissioner to Mesopotamia with equal rank to Sir H. McMahon, so that the policy is the policy of London direct, and not filtered through a remote and somewhat unsatisfactory channel. The Foreign Office and India Office are in close touch, and if the control comes from under one roof then it will be possible to prosecute a simultaneous ana equal policy. 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., l July 6, 1916.

As regards Idrisi we agree with (? Resident) that he should be trusted and supported liberally with anas and ammunition. His alliance nas been of some military and very considerable political value to us and he has carried out his engagements so far as his resources admitted, and has now given practical proof of being in earnest by seizure of Kunfida, vide Cairo’s telegrain of 9th July, As regards Idrisi’s territorial ambitions it would be prem ature at present to invite suggestions from him or consider matter in detail. In the meantime we have warned Idrisi that he must confine himself to action against Turks and avoid collision with other Arab chiefs as far as possible and he appears to be taking warning to heart. How far he has already ^been^weanedt^jHashid-Wa-Bakil away from Imam is not clear but if this is a fait accompli we should accept it and assist Idrisi with money and munitions required for their employnmnt on con dition that they are employed against Turks not against Imam unless he definitely sides with Turks. As regards Imam there appears to be no likelihood at present of his coming off the fence on our side. If however in reply to Resident’s letter he shows disposition to do so we should certainly give him ass urance of full subsidies equal to those granted by Turks: but should make no territorial promises. We deprecate any attempts at present to lay down be Hum spheres whether for ourselves Irnam or Idrisi.

Rbfwii jjig^Wyour telegram 7th July. Following is my appreciation of local political situation which I submit in full as I am handing over to General Stewart on Tuesday. Idrisi is a remarkable personality and all available evidence indicates him to be reliable. Though he would resent intrusion of Sheriff into Asir he assured Turton that if Sheriff forestalled him at Kunfida or Abha before he could arrange to attack them he would avoid conflict with him de pending on our treaty of promise to adjudicate after expulsion of Turks. Turton is absolutely convinced of his loyali/and had no intention of conveying impress ion/he thought Idrisi likely to attack Sheriff - on the contrary he is willing to help him. Under our treaty obligation we have under- • taken to provide Idrisi with munitions of war. It would be unjust to incite him to attack Turks unless we are prepared to fulfil our obligation with regard to guns as well as rifles. It is unnecessary to ask for guarantees because by means of blockade we could reduce him to terms in a short time moreover throe is every reason to believe that he is loyal and his past actions and present interests and sentiments confirm this. D V The chief reason he will have nothing to do with Imam is that latter broke faith with him in 1910. Having now written friendly letter to Sheriff he will himself keep faith. Chief-London wires that Italian ammunition is not avail able but some 15 pounders and 5inch howitzers may be forth coming from Egypt. These may be useful and I have instituted eno t uiries at Jezan but imow Mountain guns and ammunition are primary requisite. Our chief endeavour should now be to supply him with sufficient guns and ammunition ot successful action against Turks. As regards Imamus known but so far he has given the Turks little military assistance. Although he is personally subject to Turks his tribesmen for most&lt;1 f most part despise him and hate the Turks and he would find difficuly in getting large numbers to fight for him except in a popular cause. According to late Arab reports Turks are not assured of his loyalty to them. Idrisi distrusts and ^dislikes him and no co-operation is likely but Idrisi will not attack him unless we give the order or s in self defence. Idrisi has left sufficient troops on his southern border to act dn defensive. Idrisi will later on wish to attack Loheya but at present he does not wish to stir up Imam, The latter has not kara sent large Bodies of troops to help the Turks against Aden but only a few thousand. He has made a threat against Hadramatt but these have now been withdrawn. The Abdali Sultan has written friendly letters to Imam implor ing him to join the rest of Arabs against Turks and I have written/similar i® effect. If he is once assured sf .j/xv- ish cause is bad he will perhaps turn against them if he could raise tribes. Under the circumstances it appears to be the wise course to let Imam remain undisturbed until he has made up his mind. But it would be well to instruct Idrisi to come to definite terms with Hashid and Bakil who are al ready independent of Imam and friendly to Idrisi and inform us what financial assistance will be required from us. No movement to be made except on our order. ./hat appears essential is that we should know what is to be Arab status after ejectment of Turks. territory is going to be adjudicated to Idrisi who has/loyal throughout and to Imam who at present has troops fighting against us. It is possible to offer inducement of territorial acquisition to Imaui to turn against Turks because we have not made up minds what is to be Idrisi's reward for faithful service. It seems ^'Y ' that latter's expectations i -7 tfv/. from Kunfida southwafd to and including Hodeidah and probably further south to include Zaraniks some of whom have always been his adherents. I can give no hint of his expectations £?easti-ward. Our duties as adjudicators under(3) \ under our Treaty are likely to leave us friends with neither^ party if we permit undue expectations to grow up but in any case Ininas prospects are deservedly poor and it is difficult to By consolidating authority of Idrisi on western coast and of Kaiti Sultan of Mokalla on south coast of Arabia we may hope to preserve peace and security of country against outside aggresion and internal unrest especially if we are prepared ourselves to v? on} take over a Protectorate of South West cornerU4^-i^-thatlline of Aden-Taiz-Hodeidah, But if we do not take some action Imam whether he joins us or not will expect to take over country including Lahej now politically occupied by Turks and Sheikh Said. In short we may keep Imam temporarily neutral but not permanently friendly except at a price which we may well hesitate to pay but we may reduce him eventually to economic dependence by intermediary control of his trade routes to coast both west and •Addressed to S.of S.for I..repeated to Foreign Simla, High Commissioner Cairo, Bombay Political. south.Telegram from Resident, Aden.

It might be essential to fathom the attitude of the Moula (Imam) Bin Hamid-ud-Din, in case he proposes to act in concert with us, be inimical to the Turks and will not assist them in any way, such is the duty that behoves him and us to follow in accordance with the Sharia and wisdom.

Dated, 6 th Shaban 1334. 7th June 1916.I Heport by Political Officer, Kamaran The points enumerated in the Resident’s telegram of the 7 th June iyi6 were fully discussed by me this morning with SYYXD iwUSTAPHA, and I have to report as follows 1# As regards Question 1. I inferred that SYYDD LUSTAPHA was not prepared to express an opinion without previous reference to and consultation with, the SYYED IDRISSEE. He, however, admitted that the chiefs of the HASHIP and BAKKhiL tribes were in regular correspondence with the I2RI- Siftii who is on particularly good terms with NAS IB MABKOTH,the principal Sneik of tne HASHIJ) clans. MUBTAPHA has good reason to suppose that the HASHID and BAKKBL tribesmen who constitute the backbone of the Imam's influence and power are seething with discontent which he attributes, and rightly so, to tne parsimonious treatment meted out to them by the Imam YAHYA ever since his ’entente' with the Turks • ■While there are as yet no actual indications of 0 pe n rebellion or of an atteijpt to challenge tne Imam’s authority on the part of these turbulent and truculent mountaineers, 1USTAPHA considers that their defection from that notable's cause can easily be secured and that it is only a matter of money, arris and provisions. He stated that he was not in a position to torm an o us of cur ass is estimate of the price at which these two tribes could oe purcnased nor would he coraait himself to the expression of a definite opinion .as to whether SYY&amp;D IDRISES w s desir ous of cur assistance in obtaining their co-operation. purchased nor He recalled the fact that this point was raised at an interview he had wit ith the authorities at AJUi in Liarch an excuse for no various conversations with his chief various coI might add tnat the disaffection prevailing amongst the HASH ID and BAKKHL clans alluded to by SYYKD MJSTAPHA has been known by iae to exist during the past three years and that HASIR HABKOTH has practically been a free-lance since 1911 * A potent factor conducive to the fomenting of dissensions in tne Imam YAHYA‘S camp on which MUSTAPHA did not fail to comment, is the presence therein of a certain Mahomed Abool Kassim, the Imam's kinsman, who himself aspires to the Imamate Questions 2 and 4. On enquiring whether he could make any sug estions as to further assistance we might give SYYRD IDRISSKK with a view to inducing him to push an attack on the Turks simultaneously with the SHURKhtf'S advance, SYYbD MJSTAPHA expressed himself unable to give a reply without first communication with the SYYHD at f He .however, wae not reluctant to point out that the N Idrisee'e apparent inactivity since the month of KALA.hd. (end of August 191?) was solely due to his shortage of anas and more especially of ammunition. In this connection, he was of opinion tnat our Go/em ment had not afforded SYXiiD IDIUSSE the assistance expected to make good tne shortage. He mentioned that about «00 rifles and 1 * million rounds of ammunition had been supplied hy the authorities in Aden and that some 3,000 rifles and a large quantity of ammunition had been purchased in DJIB0JA1, *ut not without some difficulty. This, he argued, was far from sufficient for tne execution of the task set SYYBh IDRISES* v, might be said about cannon and The same, he added, rXL &amp; omVnAflizinp' the fact that the three shells, at the same time emphasizing r.nases-ed by the SYYliD were given to mm by best heavy guns posses. - ■&gt; tne Tur co-Italian War in l?!!' 1 ^ 12, the Italians during the Turco SYYlijJ iffiTAFHA did not deny tnat the presort lime rtune for a move against the Turks, was most opportun UeTo, '31, He led ine to Toelieve tnat tne most cordial relations ^ existed between the SYYHD I33RISEIS and the SHEREEP of LEGO A and tnat their respective political interests and spheres did not clash at any point* It would be as well to report that ] US TAP HA manoeuver- ed to evade tne point at issue as far as possible. In endeavouring to obscure Idrisi’s inaction, he expressed surprise and disappointment at brioish inactivity on tne LAHEJ front and hinted that a decision obtained in that quarter would be likely to have far-reaching effects at tne Idris i’s end. In short, the discussion with MUSTAPHA impressed on my mind tne idea that SYYKD IDKISKE was not prepared to or willing to oestir himself unless we brought greater pres- sure to bear on him. 3 . I informed SYYliD MUSTAPHA that we were in possession of reliable intelligence to the effect that all TurKish reinforcements had been diverted to the CAUCASUS and to MESOPOTAMIA. He replied tnat SYYMD lUKISKU had received reports which had been confirmed by persons arriving from tne m-UJAZ pointing to a strong concentration of Turkish troops at MBDIHA; also, that a rupture had taken place in the SHMHMMP'S relations with the Turks, and tnat SHEliKsU?

I arrived at Kamaran at 6 P.M. 9*th June &amp; there had a long private interview with Sayid Mustafa, who had been, disem barked at Kamaran on his way to Aden for a conference, owing to sickness. I did not explain to him the contents of your letter but merely touched on general points of Idrisi policy. Mustafa impressed upon me the undoubted fact that the Idrisi were the enemies of the Turks and in the course of his conversation, although he in no way committed himself to any policy, he inferred that it was his desire to accompany me on my mission to the Idrisi, and might be ol assistance. I left Kamaran at 5 P.M. lOth June &amp; arrived at Gizan at 7 P.M. and landed Mustafa who assured me that he would arrange an early interview for me with the. Idrisi • at 11 P.M. I received a message that the Idrisi would see me that night or the next night, &amp; on receipt of this message I immediately landed accompanied by Captain B.R. Reilly ana Lieut see me L.F. Nalder, R.N.V.R# I do not propose in this letter to go through the pro cedure of the long and wearisome discussion which follc^d, and _ to state a few cedure of the long and wearisom which lasted until nearly 4- A.M 4 A.M., but merely to state a f facts. The Idrisi's attitude was friendly and polite, but he held the Sheriff to combine in a general f ' letter or intimation from The political resident, ADEN.Arab rising against the Turks* He produced a letter which he stated was the only one which he had received from the Sheriff, which was read. This merely dealt with a m&amp;tter affecting the release of certain Arab prisoners. The general trend of the conversation for the first two hours dealt almost entirely with the following two points. (1) The fact of his undoubted enmity to the Turks coupled with a statement that he had been fighting them throughout the war. (2) His disbelief in the intention of the Sheriff to rise against the Turks. At this point I felt bound to cut short the discussion by requesting him to give me ' A DEFINITE ANSWER' one way or the other as to his intentions. I informed that I had no doubt that he had been taking a 'DEFENSIVE POLICY' against the Turk during the war, but pointed out the fact that there was a wide difference betwee n a 'DEFENSIVE POLICY' and a 'GENERAL OFFENSIVE' POLICY'. * I I went on to impress on him the undoubted fact of the Jiddah rising and the advantage to be gained by the immediate active policy on his part. I ended my statement by telling him that unless he could give me a definite reply fortwith as to the lines he intended to follow, I should be forced to leave the port within three hours. This had the desire (effect and the Idrisi etated that he would give a verbal guarantee, that he would take immediate steps to mobilize hie army for an offensive action against the Turks, and further stated that he would send me a written corroboration of this policy as a reply' to your letter. , . nr prompt verbal answer but requested X thanked him for his promp that his reply to you should be in the form of an open letter the tarns of which he should allow me to read as I had no in tention of leaving Gizan with a reply that was not in every3. way satisfactory* To this he agreed* I On receiving the above assurances I then informed the Idrisi that I would, on my return to the ship, send a wireless telegram to ,, K)X ,, who was at Jiddah, requesting absolute facts as regards the rifling in the Hejaz, and would forward to him as early as possible the reply* I was fortunate enough to receive, shortly after my return on board, telegram from you together with an intercepted telegram X ;elegrams from 'K)X' and Commander-in-Chief, which confirmed the offensive attached ; action taken by the sheriff and I sent such portions of these telegrams ashore by a special messenger to the Idrisi, as bore on the subject* By the same messenger who took the telegrams I informed the Idrisi that I should land at 6 P.M. on that day (llth June), and requested him to hand me the written reply confirming his policy. V I landed at 6 P.M. with Captain Reilly &amp; Lieut Nalder, and the Idrisi again personally interviewed us at 7 P.M. hours of conversation ensued and eventually I was able to obtain and read the contents of his letter. He had evidently been favourably impressed by the telegrams which had been forwarded to him, and the contents of his letter appeared to me to give him no loophole of escape from the policy which has stated definitely he intends to take up. The Idrisi was unwilling to sign the letter in my presence and give it personally to me, but on my representing the fact that I had the honour of being allowed to act as an ambassador to you and had personally received, and personally delivered your letter to him I requested that a similar honour might te done me by him. The letter was then duly sealed and delivered to me per- sonaliy in the presence of Captain Reilly and Lieut Nalder. During both interviews the following Officials were in4. /v I attendance only •- Saiyid Mustafa, Saiyid Mohammed Ba Sahi, Saiyid Yehia Shekeri. I will not dwell on the question of arms and ammunition which subject he constantly used as an argument in defence of his previous policy^ but I assured him that the British Govern ment are doing all in their power to obtain his requirements as soon as possible, and the same time pointed out that owing to the great European war certain delays in delivery were bound to arise. No obligation on behalf of the British Government political ly, Naval or Military, was undertaken in obtaining the final reply from the Idrisi, with the exception of my personal promise to endeavour to expedite the supply of ams and ammunition which he had already been promised. Finally, if my opinion is o«value, I should like to state that I had no doubt Whatever as to the loyalty of the Idrisi towards the British Government, nor have any doubts as regards his intended immediate offensive against the Turks, but I feel bound to point out that I consider his operations should be carefully watched, as, should this Arab rising sue- i ^ Arohift.

That the definite intentions of the Sheriff are obvious. Secondly. That the British Government are doing their best to assist you with arms and ammunition. I am still expecting further news from Jeddah, but at present I think the information contained in these telegrams should be sufficient to enable you to give me a letter which will state definitely your policy.I win do myself the honour to land on your shores at o P.M. tonight in the hope of receiving your communication and feel assured of the success of my mission which should result in the breaking for ever of the Turkish Yoke in Arabia and finally a lasting peace and prosperity to you and your country.

On the Island of Kamaran the Commander of H.M.S. 'NORTHBROOK” said to Saiyid Mustafa that he hoped Saiyid Mustafa would he of some help to him in his mission to the Idrisi, but later on it was proved to the Commander that Saiyid Mustafa could not influence the Idrisi Saiyid to meet his wishes and that it was the Commander himself who could make the Idrisi Saiyid engage to carry out offensive operations against the Tu rks. The Idrisi Saiyid has, since the conclusion of the treaty with the British Government, shuffled to give his word to fight the Turks, who are no doubt his deadly enemies, but this failure was due to the fact that he was always spoken to in m iid and soft words, whereas an English proverb says 'Soft words butter no parsnips'. Saiyid Mustafa could do nothing to influence the Idrisi in his pledge to go against the Turks. It is admittedly a known fact that the Idrisi has, since entering into friendly relations with the British Government, objected to allow British Officers to land during daytime on the pretext that his tribesmen or rather the Turkish Arabs might misinterpret such landing, but such an objection on his part was merely imaginary. From my experience during two short visits to Giz&amp;n I think that all the Araba within the borders of the Idrisi are quite amenable to his law and are quite agreeable to espouse his cause at any time. They already knww that the Idrisi has entered into treaty-relations with the British Government for the purpose of fighting the Turks who are considered by such fanatical Arabs as black sheep. These Arabs have already felt the 'Mailed fist' of the Turks and they call them 'Kafirs'. I heard personally yesterday some Arabs yelling out some sort of Arabic doggerels in a dance and in this doggerel they said ' 0 Saiyid Mohammed bin Ali we are ready to fight the Kafirs (they meant the Turks) at any time you are pleased and we await your orders'. If the attitude of the Arabs has gone soH.M.S. 'Horthbrook’', 12th June 1916 . Sir, I have the honour to report that on Tnursday the 8 th instant, I received orders from the First Assistant Resident, Aden, to accompany you in H.M.S. 'Northbrook' to Gizan. It was explained to me that the object of your voyage was to induce the Idrisi to adopt an immediate .and energetic offensive against the Turks, which should coincide with and assist the Sheriff’s rising against them. This rising,! was told, was on the point of occurring: Medina had in fact al ready risen and kecca &amp; Jiddah were expected to do so on tne 10th instant. The Idrisi had for some months been inactive though nominally at war with the Turks and it was important that he should be persuaded to join in w.iat was hoped ^o be a general Arab rising against Turkish authority, ky orders were that this political mission had been entrusted to you, and that I was to give you any assistance in my power. H.M.S .'Northbrook' left Aden at 8 p.m. on the 8 th instant &amp; reached Kamaran on the following evening, nere, after an interview between yourself and Saiyid Mustafa al Idrisi, it was arranged that the latter should proceed in the 'NORTHBROOK' to Gizan. I was not present at this interview but on the following day you introduced me to Saiyid Mustafa whose refined and cultivated manner and personal charm struck me as remarkable. His health was bad but he said it was improving and he remarked on the attention and care he had received at Kamaran. We reached Gizan on the evening of the 10 th instant, and that night the first interview between yourself and tne Idrisi took place in the house of th. Shah of Gizan which is on the shore. The persons present at it were on the one siae yourself, Lieut. Nalder.K.K.V.K., and Myself, and on the other tne Idrisi,Saiyid Lustafa, Lfteikh iahia L a k a ri,ministerr ! Ior ' ioiiie Afj -’airs, and Mohaimaed Yehia Ba Sadi, the Priiog-fTT^ Minister, Tne Idtisd. struck 2 ne as a man of strong character a.a i considerable intelligence. He conducted both interviews o ingle-n uaded ana seemed never to be at a loss for an ar^^U'* ment or an answer. Except for one or two references to Saiyid Mustafa, he consulted no one during the interviews ,&amp; his reply to the Resident’s letter was, I think, chiefly his o jvn composition. I douot whetner he is very much influenced by either Saiyid Mustafa or Mohammed Yehia 3 a Sahi. The latter is, I understand, untrustworthy. The interview lasted three hours, and was not at all smooth sailing. Tne Idrisi was evidently disinclined to take the vigorous action to which he was urged. He gave a number of reasons against doing so/, such as his objection to becoming involved in an attack on the Imam,whom Government had told him not to mol^est, and a plea that he was already doing as much as could reasonably be expected of him.But the outstanding arguments that he used were ( 1 ) his scepticism as to the Sheriff’s rising, and (2) his want of arms and ammunition. As to the first, it appeared to me t-dgit his doubts as to the reality of tne Sheriff’s defection from the Turks were perfectly genuine, and your offer to obtain news from Jiddah by wireless had considerable influence on his attitude. He cannot,! think,have been ignorant of the possibility of the Sheriff declaring against the Turks,but he was evidently unwilling to luove until he was convinced that the Sheriff had actually done so. He denied having received any letter from tne Sneriff uskin£ for his cooperation. As to his demands for arms and ammunition, his requirements will no doubt be met adequately now that he has undertaken an acuive ox~ -nr ivw. The t*&amp;ning point in the interview was your state ment that you would leave Gizan in the morning if he did not ^ive a definite reply, it was on this that he declared ne was willing to take the offensive as soon .as he was convinced of the1 the SnerifjMs action. Between the first interview &amp; the second,wnich took place on the 11th instant at 7 p.m.he decided to take the offensive as desired; and in this he was obviously in fluenced by the telegraros received from H.M.S .'FOX” k from Aden of events at Jiddah k on the Medina Railway,copies of whicn telegrams you forwarded to him during the afternoon. He has declared his intention of taking the offensive in the north against Kunfida,Hali and Mahail. This he explained as being tne best method of getting into touch with the She riff &amp; assisting him.He may be influenced also by two otner natives: (l) to attack tne Turks at the places where they are in least strength on his borders, (2) to anticipate the Sheriff in any possible action in this district. But whatever the ulterior motive he may have, the object of your mission has been achieved, for there is no ' doubt of his intention to take vigorous k immediate action against the Turks. His future operations will no doubt be matched &amp; the possioility of a collision oi interests oetweei liras elf k the Sheriff guarded against. The I dr is i refused the money present which was &gt;ffered to him. This in conjunction with his objection to receiving Europeans in daylight is interesting k shows,! ihink,that he does not wish to appear ^o oe in close rela tions with Christians or under obligations to them. On the V other hand it is noteworthy that on your second visit you landed at 6 P.M. in daylight,&amp; although you were not then received by the Idrisi himself, the attitude of tne poeple was friendly and polite. The Idrises susceptibilities are perhaps father on account of some of his less sopnisticated tribesmen in tne interior. *0, The Commander L.h.Turton,R.H., I have etc ., (sd) B. R. Reilly, Captain H.M.S. 'No rthbrook'H.M.S . ,, l^ortn■brook ,, , 12th J une 191 6 . Sir, I have the honour to submit the following report on your two interviews with the Saiyid Idrisi at Gizan on thi nights of the 10th and 11th June, I do not propose to enter into the details of the conversations ,but merely to record some of the impressions I received. As to the personalities of the people present The Idrisi was attended on both occasions by his cousin and adviser, the Saiyid Mustafa, by the H Prime Minister' Mohamed Basahi .and by the 'Minister of Interior' Yenia Shakeri.The Idrisi appealed a man of vigorous personality and ready tongue.He carried on the conversations without reference to his Minis ters,except for an occasional reference to Saiyid Mustafa;he had an immediate answer to any question or ob jection and gave the impression of complete independence _ from his advisers. v Basahi appeared a man of the voluble and plausiole type and did not create a very favouraole impress ion*I n id no opportunity of conversing with Yenia Shsiceri except a few conventional remarks and he too-tc no part in the conversa tions. With regard to the first interview,which lasted from about twelve midnight til]- 4* A.m. dui ing uiie first mVQ hours the Idrisi w?s obviously striving to avoid tne issue and gain time,sheltering himself behind repeated iterations (1) that he was fighting the Turks now and had been doing so singlehanded for tne past eight years ( 2 ) that he was se verely handicapped for want of ammunition. Me also t ilms it great length as to the probable attitude of the Imam Yehia, even asking if the British Government would guarantee his neutrality. He was finally brought to an issue by a very firm■ r film reit-ration of tne fact that ( 1 ) that for a very long period he had been acting on tne defensive only (2) the Sheriff*8 rising had given him the opportunity of his life ( 3 ) he had oeen given considerable supplies of ammunition and tnat if held oaci&lt; now,future supplies would avail him nothing* He then opened up what appeared to me the (for him) crucial question of the evening, the bonafides of the She riff and the actuality of his revolt .He asserted that he had every reason to believe that the Sheriff was in league with the Turks against tne British Government and himself: and asked for further proofs that the rising had actually occur red. He appeared satisfied by your promise to furnish him with any further wireless messages received from ,, FOX ,, and expressed great satisfaction on hearing from you that the Sneriff’s preparation had been made with the knowledge and assistance of the British Govemment .That appeared to me to be the point wnich determined him to declare himself for an immediate offensive. I confess that I agreeably surprised by his appear ance at the second interview.From the absence of any pre parations for our reception,! expected that we should see only some of the Ministers or even that he might have changec markedly his mind. However when he appeared his manner was xx&amp;xsxfcxxx ixxi: cordial and whole tone of the proceedings was a great deal smoother than it had been on the previous night,and the letter was signed without any argument or principle. During the first interview he stated that Hasir Mabkhut, the paramount cnief of the Hashed was no*' at Gizan There are only two other points which I would wish t o make , The first is the question of communication between him and tne Sheriff. He repeatedly asserted that he had re- ce ived no letter from the Sheriff other than that shown us, a few lines relating to the rele-ise of certain Arab prisoners heldheld by the Idrisi. But tne messenger,Hamed Areifan, wio brought the letter was at Gizan and when I s aw him said that he had brought a letter from the Sheriff which had been seen and handed to him by the Sudan authorities. I am inclined to suspect that some other letter had been received which he did not produce. The second point is tne direction in whichthe Idrisi’s offensive is to be directed. He states that he pro poses to operate against the Turkish garrisons at Mahail, Hali and Kunfidah, to ensure his communications with the Sheriff and to relieve him from possible pressure from these troops. To this no objection can be made, but it might be necessary in the future to warn the Idrisi tnat tne value of his offensive might be lessened if it were carried in direc tions which the Sheriff might regard with suspicion, I have etc., (sdj L.

Beyond doubt this is a great advantage to us. But up till the present no information of this has reached us oy land or from our frontier which marches with his. But we have received a letter from the Commander of your war- ship M HORTHBHOOIC w , conveying to me the telegrams which have reached him from Aden and from the Commander oi the Wars nips which patrol the Red Sea. Prom there we learn that the Sheriff has occupied the Railway Between Medina the Holy and Medam f Salih and that your ships have bombarded the Turkish positions in Jiddah. We rejoice greatly at this news and nave oegun arrange ments for of fens ive action if God wills. Our troops which were engaged on the Northern frontier (of) with the Turks will advance shortly by the might of Allah against tneir positions in front of us to prevent them aiding their orothers in tne Hedjaz. You are aware how we have resisted the Turks wnen we were f single-handed. How then will it be when another is joined with us. It is unlikely, from reasons of faith and intelligence tnat we shall delay. You know that we are engaged with the Turks, north,south and east. Tnis is no small matter and requires very large supplies of ammunition. We have about 30,000 Italian rifles and they form theK i i. the chief equipment of our adherents* Por these we have no ammunition and we have not^iing .aore iiiiportant to urge on the J-overnment than the facilitation of supplies of ammunition and also ammunition for the guns and all necessities for firearms* follow the Imam, it is true that tney have no obligations to fidelity to the Turks and are concerned with their advan tage -and livelihood. It is possible for me to request their presence here and indeed last year tney made ■ilxJ^kfrruns to me, they and many of the tribes, because they see that the Turks oppressed them in the past and have now begun to introduce Germans, people of anotner place and another race, whose good benaviouap they doubt, into tneir country. Therefore they believe in the Aden Government, having proved the goodness of its dealings with the people. Therefore their hearts were won over and tney came to us witn tnis purpose. We acquainted the Government of this, but received no direct reply and as we do not lixce evasion we put them off until another time. asked for our help and that we have not replied to him, we nave no news of this except from yvur letter. It is true that the Sheriff wrote us a letter, that it referred to certain prisoners of war held by us, wnose release he wished. Tnis letter we have shown to your representative. It would be more satisfactory if letters (from the Sheriff to me) were sent tnrough you. Loheiya, by the will of Allah it will be soon be easy. At the moment we are hurrying on preparations for the Northern attack to make good the communications between ourselves and the Sneriff, so that should a force come from tne North we may reinforce the Sheriff. Also for the administration of the Northern districts, for this reason tnat after this happy movement of the Sneriff, we must collect our tribes under our control and inform them of tne good news of the presence With reference to y&amp;ur remarks on the tribes which V/itn regard to what you say that the Sheriff has Witn regard to the preparations for an attack on ofof the opportunity 'ind take from them sure guarantees faithfully prosecuting an attack.

We will inform you of their (Turkish) state and of all that depends therefrom* We nave implicit trust in our cousin Saiyid Mustafa el Idrisi. Witn regard to our friend Slheikn Mohamiied 13nscuii, we are convinced that his sole desire is the extermination of tne Turks in any way possible. Owing to the wealth they took from him in the days men they controlled the Red Sea, he nas no desire for their preservation, and if we believed that he did (so desire) we should not have aiaed him in any direction.

They had come to us last year together with several other tribesmen, because they find that they had severely suffered at the hands of the Turks in the past. They (Turks) have now brouijht the Germans into their country. These are of different sect and nationality. They doubt their conduct and therefore they prefer the Aden Authoritiee f as they are sanguine of their good conduct towards the people. Under these cir cumstances their (Arab) hearts have been attracted towards them (Authorities) md had approached us mainly for this purpose.

Besides it is more important that the northern portion should be united for the purpos# of auch emergency. At tne event of the Exalted Sharif’s movement, it is essential to concentrate the tribesmen under us and to inform them of the existence of a helper and to take solemn undertaking from them to the effect that they shall faithfully carry on continous Attacks.
