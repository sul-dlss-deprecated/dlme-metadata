It concerns a treaty between Britain and El Katr (also spelled Katar in the file) [Qatar].In a copy of a telegram to the Secretary of State for India, dated 13 August 1913, the Viceroy of India acknowledges the former's wish to negotiate a treaty as soon as Britain's convention with the Turkish government comes into force [the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913, which was never ratified]. However, the Viceroy suggests that, following the recent death of Shaikh Jasim [Shaikh Jāsim bin Muḥammad Āl Thānī, Ruler of Qatar], any action should be deferred until his successor, Shaikh Abdullah [Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Jāsim Āl Thānī], has established himself as ruler.The volume contains the following:a draft agreement between the British Government and Shaikh Abdullah;British officials' views on the perceived attitude adopted by Bin Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] towards the British authorities and British interests, following his recent settlement with the Turkish government;discussion on the importance of concluding negotiations with Bin Saud prior to completing a treaty with El Katr;the ejection of the Turkish garrison from El Katr;discussion as to whether to retain an arms traffic clause in the draft agreement, following the near collapse of arms traffic during the first year of the First World War;an account of treaty negotiations between the Political Agent, Kuwait (Lieutenant-Colonel William George Grey, accompanied by the Bahrain Political Agent Major Terence Humphrey Keyes) and Shaikh Abdullah;a copy of the final treaty, signed on 3 November 1916 and ratified on 23 March 1918.The volume features the following principal correspondents:Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Zachariah Cox, and Major Stuart George Knox, officiating Resident in Cox's absence);Viceroy of India [Charles Hardinge; Frederic John Napier Thesiger];Secretary of State for India (Robert Offley Ashburton Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe; Joseph Austen Chamberlain; Edwin Samuel Montagu);Foreign Office;Secretary to the Government of India's Foreign and Political Department [Alfred Hamilton Grant];Political Agent, Kuwait (Lieutenant-Colonel William George Grey).The part includes a divider that gives the subject and part number, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in the part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia 'Abd al-'Azīz bin 'Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa'ūd</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Emir of Qatar 'Abdullāh bin Jāsim Āl Thānī</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>El Katr</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arms traffic</topic></subject><subject><topic>Anglo-Qatar Treaty (1916)</topic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000119#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000119#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
