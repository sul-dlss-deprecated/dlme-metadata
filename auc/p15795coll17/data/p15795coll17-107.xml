Assabghy recollects his education and study in AUC’s solid state physics program, explaining that like a number of AUC science faculty after completing his MA studies he went abroad  for his doctorate (in his case to the UK), and returned in 1970 to serve as a faculty member.  The contributions of his cohort of science faculty and others throughout his time at AUC are described throughout. He relates the efforts of 1960s president Tom Bartlett to elevate the sciences at AUC, and describes in detail the positive features of the Science Building on the downtown Tahrir Square campus which was constructed in that decade. The expansion of science education and research at AUC (like the origins of engineering) and longtime Science Department chairman Adli Bishay’s accomplishments are covered including his role in the launching of AUC’s Desert Development Center in the 1980s, plus Assabghy’s own participation in the DDC’s research activities. Assabghy was Dean of the School of Sciences and Engineering from 1999 to 2005, and he discusses major developments from his term like the reorganization of the school into multiple units by discipline, establishment of the Science and Technology Research Center and nanotechnology research, and the starting of the Electronics Engineering and Actuarial Science programs at AUC. His time on the Senate, including term as chair and the controversy over and resolution of the leading faculty issues from that time: the discrepancy in compensation and retirement age between foreign and Egyptian faculty.  </dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
