This programme differs v/idely from that of the Popular Reform League and, according to the preamble, includes only such projects as can be carried out 3. Nevertheless, the programme is only a little less ambitious and compre hensive than those habitually issued by previous Governments and it seems unlikely that more than a small part of it will ever be carried out , 4 . ' In accordance with precedent, the programme opens with a definition of the Government’s attitude towards Great Britain and the declaration of po icy made under this head is, I think, satisfactory. It indicates however, that as the Prime Minister has more than once suggested to me, the Government mte to obtain all the benefits which they can from the Treaty of Alliance. 5 . The programme of administrative reforms and improvements contains nothing which calls for special comment, but it is possible that the fina f ^ ial v lte ™ ) S l which deal with the revision of the income-tax law, the supervision of banks and the introduction of legislation for the employment of insurance money m 1 q, cover plans likely to cause difficulties for British commercia Pterests^ I shaH, therefore, watch carefully the action taken by tfie Government ^se^ 6 Under the heading “ Justice, a complete overhaul of the judicial sysm and basic laws of the country is adumbrated, but, bearing m X® a yCl ^ s have already been spent in vain efforts to produce a new criminal code, it se unlikely that the present Government will be able to redraft all the civ , commercial and criminal laws in the mannei suggeste . -i- , ■ 7 The C£ Defence ” paragraphs reveal little, but the proposed reconciliatio of Civil and military needs in important economic schemes foreshadows I fw a increasing- use of the military veto on many projects for the improvement 01 internal 11 communications.

To strengthen the ties of friendship and co-operation between Iraq and the Turkish Republic, and to use every endeavour to hasten the conclusion of a non-aggression pact between Iraq, Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan. 3. To continue the friendly relations between Iraq and Iran, and employ every means to strengthen them, and to settle all outstanding questions between the two countries. i. To strengthen brotherly relations with the Kingdom of Ibn Saud and with the other Arab States; and to maintain and cement the friendly relations between Iraq and all other States.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that the Tiflis newspaper tf Zarya Vostoka', which, as you are aware, specialises in criticism of the misdeeds of 'British imperialism' in Asia, published on November 27th an article on the subject of the ' coup d ! 6 ta t in Iraq.. v/riter rejects what he regards as the tacile assumption of the foreign press tha^ the change of 0 -overnmeiit in Iraq, came as a surprise to His Majesty’s Government and will be damaging to British imperial interests: on the contrary, the new Government, whose position is inevitably shaky, may xind the prospect of using British aid to strengthen its hold very tempting. In any case Iraq., though allegedly independent, is completely at the mercy of Great Britain, and the British press has hinted very broadly that no undermining of British interests will be tolerated. The British military advisers, who 'are known to have a decisive influence in the Iraq array', placed no obstacles in the way of the revolt. They may now decide to use their influence for or against the new Government. In the former case the Bekir Sidki regime will be faced with an increased danger from 'the popular masses, who are anti imperialist. These masses suffer under the oppression of Great Britain and retire of the Government a genuine defence of their national interests. The heroic struggle of the Arabs against the British colonists in Palestine has proved to be a mighty stimulus to the further development of the anti- ie Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C etc. , etc. , M.P. , etc. • fimperialist movement in Iraq and in other countries of the Arabian Jiast. ,( 3 .

It is called the ^ .Popular Reform League.” The secretary is Kamil Chadirji, the Minister for Economics and Communications, and the founders include Yusuf Iz-ul-Din, the Minister tor Education, Abdul Qadir Ismail, a man who, in the past, has shown leanings towards communism, and Muhammad Salih-al-Qazzaz, who for some time has been active as a leader of workmen’s movements (Iraq Personalities No 58). 2 . I enclose herein a copy of the league’s programme as published m its official organ, the daily newspaper the Ahali (the People). Non will see that there is a noticeably Red tinge about many of its items, and that it adds considerably to the discord of incompatible ideals which seem to inspire the members of the new Government. Speculation about the future becomes, there fore all the more difficult. It is hard enough to find a common political purpose for men of such different types as the ambitious and, to judge from his pasp ruth less soldier, General Bakr Sidqi, and the Voltairian Republican, Hikmat Sulaiman, but to conceive a formula which will cover both their views and those of the men who have put together this patchwork of ultra-modern schemes of social reform is a well-nigh impossible task. Moreover, even if the I rime Ministei succeeds in establishing agreement between men of such divergent political ou - look I find it hard to believe that the present Cabinet has enough knowledge oi experience to be able successfully to give effect to these far-reaching 3 It should however, be remembered that, although the Popular Reform League has been created to support the Government, the Government have not pledged themselves to adopt the full programme of the league.

But even now, more than a fortnight after the crime, it is still impossible to obtain any details of what happened. Those who may be blamed for it are naturally reticent, while others seem to prefer not to discuss it. As time has passed, however, a few facts have come to light, which should perhaps be put on record v 2.' In my despatch No. 546, which I had the honour to address to you on the 2nd November, I stated that the King of Iraq had sent Jafar out to meet the two generals. When I saw His Majesty some days later, he denied somewhat fretfully that this was so. He said that it had been Jafar himself who had insisted upon going King Ghazi had twice begged the general to refrain from so toolhaidy In enterprise, but Jafar had confidently asserted that he could prevent the army from coming into Bagdad. When His Majesty had seen that Jafar was at all costs bent upon going, he had given him a letter addressed to Bekr Sidqi an had sent one of his aides-de-camp with him. . , . , 3 When giving me this version of the story, King Ghazi turned again and again for confirmation to Rustam Haidar, who was present at the audience, and I got the impression that His Majesty’s conscience was by no means easy. But whatever the truth, it is generally believed in Bagdad that Jafar went out at the instance of his sovereign. ^ ^ xr . n r 4 From another source I have heard that, not content with King Ghazi s letter, Jafar was imprudent enough to send out ahead of himself telegrams and messages, addressed to his personal friends amongst the senior officers of the two divisions, urging them to disassociate themselves from the movement aiffi a these messages were intercepted by Bekr Sidqi. From the head of the Blits military mission, who saw Jafar just before he started, I have learned that Jafa set out full of confidence that he could give “ those silly swine a lesson 5 When Jafar reached the point of the advance guard, he found the load so blocked with armed cars that his own motor car could not pass. He was here met by an officer, who told him that Bekr Sidqi wished to see invited him to get out of his own motor car and to pass through the block on foot. King Ghazi’s aide-de-camp wished to go with bun. Imt was told to wa where he was for Jafar’s return. It seems that Jafar left His Miyesty s letter and his revolver in his own motor car and went with the °* cel ' H side of the armed cars he was driven into the desert and shot. He nevei got as far as Bekr Sidqi. He was buried where he fell, and a determined silence is kep concerning the whereabouts of his grave. WQC 6 . A search for the motive for so senseless a crime suggests that it was fear lest Jafar’s presence amongst the trwps might spoil Bekr Sidqi s plam than once of late in tight corners on the Euphrates Jafar had been know , y sh^er force of his perfonal appeal, to tip the scale and to turn -gr^men from war to peace. This fear must have been still fur f her ,^ d t e l Affe a |ie which had been intercepted. One may well imagine that Beki Sidqi and the officers of his small force must have been m desperate mood bft^r “dement had failed thev would have emerged from it as xebels. It has bee y success that has made them the liberators of the country from the tyranny of YaS1 7 As to the identity of the murderer there seems to be little doubt. When I asLd King Ghazi who it was, His Majesty replied, without an instants hesitation, that it had been Ismail-al Tohallah. [881 a— 1 ]8 It was not until many days after that the crime was accepted in Bagdad as a fact That Jafar had not returned from his excursion was generally known, but it was widely assumed that he was being held prisoner by the army at Qaraghan. The slowness with which the truth leaked out had the effect of mitigating a little the shock to the public mind Nevertheless, as is natural, the crime has made a most painful impression. There were inevitably those who said that it was a not unjust retribution for the much-machine-gunning which Jafar had done in his time. But on the whole they were few 9 . General Abdul Latif Nuri did not hear of Jafar s death until he and Bekr Sidcji had reached Bagdad. I understand that he was moved to tears. 10 Mr. Edmonds tells me that, when Hikmat Sulaiman was told of the murder, he refused to form a Cabinet, and that great pressure had to be brought upon him to dissuade him from throwing his hand in. When, a day or two after, I urged him to make suitable provision for Jafar’s widow and to help her to join her children in Egypt, he told me that he had already , made arrangements for this, and that he was finding appropriate employment abroad for Jafar’s brother, Tahsin-al-Askari, who had hitherto been Director-General of Irrigation.

The Government are concentrating on their economic projects but are showing nervousness about some of the people likely to become a focus of hostile intrigue. Ali Mumtaz ? a senior official in Ministry of Finance and son-in-law of Yasin Pasha has been persuaded co tame several months’ leave abroad and some pressure is being brought to sear on Rustam Haidar to go away too. He has so far resisced. Ahmed al Manassifi* the secretary to ministry of Defence (see my desnatch No. 455) who is an old satellite oi Huri Pasha ? has been given some months’ leave outside Iraq. This nervousness is to a large extent due to Nuri Pasha s somewhat imprudent activities in Bgypt and a judge to whom Nuri Pasha was found to be telephoning; has been asked go leave the country for a time for the good oi his health. Mr. Edmonds tells me that the Prime Minister is accing wisely as Minister of the Interior but is so busy chat ne does not give all the attention he should to his work there. General Hay has so far nothing but good to report of his Ministers and Bekr Sidki. Naii Shaukat s who has been here on a short visit from Angora, told Mr. Edmonds that he had brought for the Prime Minister two pieces of advice from I sine t. (i)19 2 . (1) To do nothing to spoil Iraq's good relations with His Majesty's Government. (2; To go slow with his social reforms and not to try to follow the pace set by Turkey. He also said that while the Turks cared nothing for the fall of Yasin kasha they had been shocked by banishment of Nuri rasha. Naji Shaukat added that he thought that the Cabinet need strengthening. He had been relieved to find that ne himself had not been asked to join it e Although a close friend of the Prime Minister he would have been reluctant to enter his Government unless Jamil al i.iadfai had also been included, lie expressed fears about the Minister of Finance in whom he had no faith. I gather from Mr, Hogg that Jafar Abu liman has so far shown no aptitude for his office. The public are feeling some disappointment that the Govern ment have delayed publication of their programe but the Prime Minister tells me that it is nearly ready and will be out in a few days.

[E 7145/1419/93] Copy No. Sir A. Clark Kerr to Mr. Eden.—(Received November 16.) (No. 546. Confidential.) Sir, Bagdad, November 2, 1936. EVENTS in Bagdad during the last few days have moved so rapidly that I have not had, until now, the leisure to do more than to give you a hasty, and, I fear, a blurred sketch of what has happened. In the present despatch I propose to try to put before you as full a picture as I can of all that has passed, and, in another despatch, to venture some speculations upon the effects of the overthrow of the Yasin Government by the Iraqi army leaders. 2. To all but what must have been a very small group of people, the morning of Thursday, the 29th October, was nothing but the beginning of a normal Bagdad day. The Afghan Minister for War had just arrived and had been met at the station with appropriate ceremonial. Ministers, secure in office, were at their desks and about their ordinary business (which, at this season, begins at a very early hour), when, at half past 8 , eleven aeroplanes flew over the town. There was nothing remarkable about their appearance, because it is the habit of the Iraqi air force to make the day’s routine flights about this time. But they were flying lower than usual, and soon were seen to be dropping handfuls of leaflets. About an hour later I learned what these leaflets contained. It was a manifesto appealing to the King, in the name of the army, to dismiss the Yasin Cabinet and to set up a new Administration under Hikmat Sulaiman. It called upon Govern ment officials to leave their offices until the new Cabinet was formed, and it fore shadowed the possibility that the army might be compelled to take forcible measures. It was signed by General Bekr Sidqi, who described himself as “ Commander of the National Forces of Reform.” 3. The movement had been carefully planned and the secret well kept. Bdkr Sidqi had chosen a moment when all but two battalions of the Iraqi army were gathered in the neighbourhood of Qaraghan, on the road to the Persian frontier, for the purpose of their annual divisional training. Of the two remaining battalions, one was on the Euphrates and the other was at Mosul. Bagdad, stripped of troops, lay open and defenceless. The Chief of the General Staff, General Taha-al-Hashimi, the brother of the Prime Minister, was in Angora on his way back from Europe. The air force had been called from Hinaidi to Qaraghan the day before without attracting special attention. 4. At about a quarter to 10 I received a message from King Ghazi asking me to go to see him. I lost no time in doing so. I found His Majesty in a state of great nervousness. He told me that he had had bad news which had taken him rudely by surprise. He assumed that I had already seen the leaflet, but there was more than that. Hikmat Sulaiman had brought him a letter from Bekr Sidqi and Abdul Latif Nuri, the generals commanding the two divisions now engaged in manoeuvres, which made the same demands as those in the leaflet, and which added that, if King Ghazi did not acquiesce in them, Bagdad would be bombed from the air in three hours’ time. His Majesty described the helpless condition of the capital and asked for my advice, making it clear to me that he thought that any idea of resistance should be dismissed. I asked him whether he had said or done anything which might give colour to the belief that the movement had his approval. He assured me that he had not. I asked whether he felt that his authority was strong enough to check the movement if he allowed it to become known that he was opposed to it. He said that he did not think so. I asked if he had consulted his Ministers. He said that he had seen Yasin Pasha about half an hour before and had found him half minded to resign. I then made to His Majesty a few obvious remarks about the disastrous consequences that had in most countries followed the excursion into politics of the army, and I advised him [856 q—1] B 1 i2 to lose no time in getting mto touch with B^the' SKS 0 “^HidTot cafe to forecast P This suggestion seemed to commend itself to him. , xt ■ a XTnri arrived Yasin showed no signs of 5.

Bekr Sidqi had replied that the movement, of which he was at the head, was being carried out with the knowledge 3 the approval of King Ghazi. Here His Majesty winced a little, and denied Ah empE the truthVf this statement. Yasin ^ chances of resistance. There was clearly still a lot of battle left m him. He glanced at and rejected an idea that King Ghazi, with the Government, should abandon Bagdad and withdraw to the provinces, where they would have time to gather together some forces with which to meet the army. King Ghazi then sug gested that, if Yasin Pasha resigned, he might be able, as time went on to procure the fall of his successor, and His Majesty hinted that such a fall would be agree able to him Meanwhile, Yasin had been pulling his forelock, which is always a sign that he finds himself in a difficulty. He then suggested that, before he was called upon to take a decision, His Majesty should send for Hikmat and enquire what his intentions were. If Hikmat could show that they were generally in the interests of the country, Yasin w T ould willingly yield up his place. King Ghazi then asked that Hikmat should be sent for, and, somewhat to my surprise, I learned that he was already waiting in the palace. I thought the time had come for me to withdraw, and I did so, arranging with Yasin and Nuri that, on their way back from the palace, they should call at the Embassy and tell me the results of Hikmat’s conversation with King Ghazi. 6 . When I reached the Embassy, I wms told that a flight of five aeroplanes had dropped four bombs in the neighbourhood of the “ sarai.” The shooting had been good. Three bombs had fallen near the Prime Minister's office and the Ministry of the Interior, and one in the river. It was now about midday. Yasin and Nuri did not come to the Embassy, and at about 1 o’clock I heard that the Government had resigned and that the usual Iradah had been issued empowering Hikmat to form a Cabinet. It seemed that the bombs had done their work. Meanwhile, I had got into touch with the Air Officer Commanding and discussed with him the defence scheme and how best to put it into effect in the event of serious trouble breaking out in the capital. After that there was nothing to be done but to wait upon events. 7. By about 5 in the evening the first advance units of Bekr Sidqi’s force began to reach Bagdad unobtrusively and without incident, and by 7 o’clock he was in the “ sarai ” with Hikmat Sulaiman. Shortly afterwards, I received a message from the new Prime Minister to the effect that his Cabinet had been formed, and that he wished to maintain the present friendly relations with His Majesty’s Government and hoped to have the support of the Embassy. As somewhat alarmist reports were reaching me about the state of the town, t drove through the main streets, where everything appeared to me to be quiet and normal. An organised demonstration of welcome to Bekir Sidqi’s troops round about the North Gate had, it seems, passed off without incident. 8 . That evening I was giving one of my dull routine dinner-parties. In the middle of it I was told that Nun and another were m the house and wanted urgently to see me. I found that they had slipped across the river in a row-boat and had come in by the water gate. Nuri, however, had been seen and recognised by the sentry. He was in a state of acute nervous excitement. He told me that after I had left King Ghazi that morning, His Majesty had sent Jafar-al-Askari to the two generals with a letter and instructions to try to dissuade them from coming into Bagdad. Mffien Jafar reached the advance guard, he had been met b&gt; Ismail-al-Tohallah (the man who carried out the massacre at Simel), who had taken Jafar off the main road into the desert and had shot him. Nuri had hadthis information from one Ahmed-al-Manassifi, the secretary to the Ministry of Defence, whom he had now brought with him to the Embassy. In his turn Ahmed had had it from Bekr feidqi and his officers. But there was more than this. It was the intention of a group of these officers that night to murder Yasin, Rashid Ali and Nuri himself. Nuri had been able to warn Yasin, who was now in hiding in the town, but he had not been able to get into touch with Rashid Ali He asked whether he himself might sleep the night at the Embassy. He had evidently come prepared to do so, because he had brought a small piece of luggage with him. I clearly could not refuse this request, but I save to it that Ahmed-al- Manassifi got out of the house as discreetly and as quickly as possible. He had obviously come unwillingly, and he wanted no speeding. ^ It needed some little play-acting to be able to deal with Nuri and my dinner-party at the same time, but I understand that none of my guests appreciated that anything very unusual was afoot. ^ o ^ 9. It seemed to me that no time should be lost in getting into touch with the new Piime Minister, in acquainting him with the plot and in using such influence a r ^ ^ ht ^ ave P reven t its being put into effect. For this purpose I asked Mi. Edmonds to come at once to the Embassy, and I explained the situation to him. At my request he went immediately to Hikmat’s house with a message from me to the effect that murders such as I understood now to be planned, comin»’ on top of the shooting of Jafar-al-Askari, which I should be obliged to report to you would create so deplorable an impression in London that I could not foresee the consequences. The first would probably be the rupture of relations with His Majesty s Government. At the same time I urged the Prime Minister to take instant measures to protect the lives of the three men concerned. It was about 1 ° clock when Mr. Edmonds returned, with an emphatic assurance from Hikmat at he would not allow any of the late Ministers to be harmed, and that he was taking the precaution of posting police guards on their houses. At the same time he expressed appropriate horror at the murder of Jafar, adding, however that he was m np way responsible for it, as it had taken place before he had accepted ofhee. Ihe fault lay with the King for his thoughtlessness in allowing Jafar to go to meet the army m its present temper. 10 Meanwhile I had sent Nuri to bed, for he was on the verge of a collapse but, before doing so, I staged a little scene designed to suggest to the sentrv who wVlffh him arrive that Nun was leaving by the same way as he had come', and. h® the sentry s attention was re-engaged, Nuri got quickly back into the house SurfeoVminT ^ f ° r b ° ySbut * was ^ ™ tune froid Mr k a d!LnY he r 0rning 0 f .9 e followin g da y. the 30th, I received a visit trom Mr Edmonds, who came with a message from the Prime Minister which “f h T S h aSSUranCeS f f yT dlineSS and Ms WIsh that 1 should co-operate Rashid Ali kfJA enCy o f vf atlS j yl .v g myse ! f beyond doubt that Yasin, Nuri and to receivt me h an!l d T b P ut , be y ond , th e. reach of danger prompted me to ask him him for aC.’A k Called T 11 hlm m Jhe course of the morning.

It had occurred to him that it might be possible that I could do so (he dear y knew that Nuri was in the Embassy, but was too good-mannered to show it). If by 6 anv bhancl I 'were able to do so, it would be a help to him if I could advise Nuri 'also to leave Iraq and could make arrangements for his departure 12 I spent most of the rest of the day with Nun, who was m a distressing state of nervousness, hut so soon as plans were concluded with the Air Officer Commanding for his departure by aeroplane to Egypt, he recovered his spirits and he began to talk freely, if still a little wildly, about the crisis. I shall not weary you with an account of what he said, except to tell you that he was insistent in the expression of the belief that King Ghazi was privy to Bekr Sidqi’s movement, and that he said that this was also the conviction ot Yasm. I had watched King Ghazi very closely while he, with his Ministers, was discussing the affair on the morning of the day before, and I am bound to say that I, too, gained the impression that it came as no surprise to His Majesty. 13. Shortly before midnight, Nnri was conveyed, with his family, quietly to Hinaidi, whence he left for Egypt before dawn on the 31st October. I was glad to hear about 10 o’clock of his arrival at Amman, and it was with^great relief that I learned early in the afternoon of the safe passage over the Syrian frontier of Yasin and Rashid Ali. That day I saw King Ghazi again and I found His Majesty almost cock-a-hoop. He readily acquiesced in my suggestion that suitable provision should be made for Jafar’s widow and that she should be sent to join her children, who were at school in Egypt. 14.

This had been tried Ld it had failed, for Yasin and Nuri still held together Yasm had even hinted at ten years of office and Nuri was making more modest but no ^ confident ulans for what was to be done a year hence. No one could toresee mat the army would turn and savage the breast that had sucffiled it so ten 'g V ^ it, indeed, Yasin had seemed to draw a great P ar y° f , f 1 , 1 * fy^fh- H 1 ® vA it was at its head. It had always been ready to do his b \ d dyf&gt; i* ha d done * well. And upon it he had spent almost a fourth part of the i^ome jrom the State. He had pushed forward and pampered its senior not reckoned with what we must for the present regard as q P . ambitions, and to-day it seems to be these that have now driven him into exile ^4 The situation which Yasin left behind him is still confused and uncertain, more particularly in so far as the army itself is concerned. It is not yet possible to say^to what extent the army as a whole is with the nip vement y hlch bl ° a g Hi km at Sulaiman to power. For the purposes of his march on Bagdad, Bekr Sidqi gathered round him the field and company officers of the two divisions upon whom he knew he could count, and thus created a composite force of cnSripthiuP- iust under 1 000 men. The rest of the army was left m ignorance of whS^was^happening! I have it from the King of Iraq that even the men of what Eekr Sidoi calls his ££ Forces of Reform ” were not told by then officeis of what they q were about until they were almost at the gates of ^d^ oart of the officers left behind at Qaraghan were Jafar or Taha men who Bekr Sidqi had not thought fit to take into coiffidence, That he was a We to e a «y with him his fellow divisional general, Abdul Latif Nun, now Minister or Defence was no great achievement, for, although a close friend of Jafar Abdul Latif is not, I understand, of those who would have stomach for a figh on such an occasion. [856 q-2]. i fWfore that there should be much speculation 5. It is not unnatural, thejetore tna under the control of Bekr Sidqi, whether the army will now becom.^^P friends of j a f ar an d Taha, or whether by the submission and emopeia _ courage to resist him. Whichever these officers will have the stre g ' . ai SQU i e ting, for resistance might well choice they make, the situation m pro p a bly mean their gradual elimination mean civil war and submission Wion from which he could make his saa.ca.wsa w r ^ ■»«»*&gt; dangers ^°^g 1 f 1 ' a ™ kr gid ; has WO n over to himself the Iraq! air force. But withlrhe ha take,! into his arms one who is, m the ^ew of those who clmm to know the very man who, in his turn, will overthrow Bekr bidqi himselt. I refer lo”Mohamed Ali Jawad (the dropper of the bombs) now Director of the Air ForcT He is said to be still more ambitious than and probably as ruthless and unscrupulous as his new chief. This is, therefore, a union which seems to have the elements of much trouble while it holds together, and still more when it breaks up.^ ^ ^ ^ ^ thege men have exposed themselves to the revenge of those whom they have chased from office and from Iraq. With the senaeiess murder of Jafar as a precedent, it is not hard to guess the form that this revenge might take. Nuri left Bagdad breathing hate and vendetta against Bekir Sidqi and Mohamed Ali, and Nuri is not a man to forget or forgive. I have no reason to believe that Yasin’s sentiments were any milder, while the means at the disposal of Rashid Ali, if he cared to use them, would be more than enough for any purpose of this sort that he might have in mind. This would be enough to explain the alleged eagerness of Bekr Sidqi’s young officers to dispose once ana for all of these three men. It would also explain why to-day the possibility of the sudden disapDearance of Bekr Sidqi is discussed as something quite natural. The murder of Jafar may, indeed, be found to have set a fashion which may bring with it much trouble for the future of Iraq. 8 . Above all this Hikmat Sulaiman seems to sail with a composure and a determination v/hich are impressive. Elsewhere I have reported to you that he has told me that at all costs he will oblige the army to resume its normal and appropriate place in the polity of the country, and that he himself will not submit to any form of domination by Bekr Sidqi. This was the main burden of a two hours’ talk which I had with him when he came to the Embassy yesterday. In reply to the sustained doubts which I expressed, he begged me earnestly to believe that this was his unshakable resolve, and he said that by the end of the present week I should see the first effects of his efforts. What I shall watch for keenly is the return to their units of the component parts of the “ Forces of Reform.” 9. I have no reason to doubt the sincerity of the Prime Minister or, indeed, his fixity of purpose, but I am by no means convinced that he will be successful. All that I have heard of Bekr Sidqi leads me to think that it might need a tougher man than Hikmat Sulaiman to put him down. At the same time I am advised that he could not have ventured upon his march on Bagdad with any hope of success unless he had been sure of the support of such men as Hikmat Sulaiman and Jafar-abu-l imman, who could carry with them a large volume of public opinion. But I coniess that I do not at present think that much comfort may be drav/n from this. Bekr Sidqi may well have seen in co-operation with these two good men a passing means of advancing his own career, which, broadly speaking, began with the grizzly triumph of Simel, moved on to still further bloodv glories on the Euphrates and has now come to its present dazzling success. If he escapes the vengeance of the many powerful enemies he has made for himself and is given tme to consolidate his position, the way to supreme power lies open to him ° We still have to learn that he is not the man to take it—the final step. All this is probably to put things at their worst, but it suggests possibilities not so remote that we can afford to set them aside. 10. Now, perhaps, the time has come to look about for some encouraging features m the situation. They are, I am bound to sav, slender, and for them nt t m « S a tmn iu the u eW 1 nme Master. If there is value in the claim that hone I ill I 1 ' A'i. 'tfl 1 ’ 5 ' Vv^r 10 ; 1 T thout Clvilian support, there may be some hope that, befoie Beki Sidqi has had time to consolidate his position Hikmat Sulaiman may be able to gather strength enough to make his own predominant.He has certainly started well enough, and he has been acclaimed by the fickle Iraqi people with what has the air of being spontaneous enthusiasm. Such as is known of his programme has won wide popular support. It is a beautiful Utopia. But some of its features are so rich in promise of antagonism from vested interests that the very programme itself might well be the undoing of Hikmat. 11. So far as we are concerned, his attitude has been more than correct. He has gone out of his way to give satisfaction and to declare his friendship. He has accepted and acted upon every suggestion I have made to him. He has assured me that he will honour the treaty of 1930, the railway convention and all other agreements concluded between His Majesty’s Government and Iraq. And this is not ungratifying from one who, in the past, has been the harshest critic of all these instruments. But his obvious eagerness to please may be no more than a sign of weakness. I cannot say as yet. In any case, as I believe that in him lies our only present hope of escaping a military dictatorship, I think that, so long as he pursues his policy as declared to me, he should have our support. 12. These reflections upon the present position of the new Prime Minister lead me to examine the causes which have combined to bring him into partnership with a man like Bekr Sidqi. His last effective appearance in politics was in the company of Yasin and Rashid Ali, when Ali Jawdat was overthrown in 1935. Why should he have turned against them? The answer to this question may perhaps be found in the difference between his outlook on life and that of the leaders of the late Government. Hikmat Sulaiman has shown no desire to enrich himself. His agnosticism, his indifference to pan-Arab ideals, his contempt for nepotism are all in sharp contrast to the fanaticism, the narrow nationalist views and the acquisitiveness of Yasin and Rashid Ali. So soon as the common cause which had united him and them had been crowned with success, these essential differences of character quickly brought the three of them into conflict and drove Hikmat Sulaiman out into a cold aloofness. Of late, however, ^ his growing irritation against the Government had become more and more marked. He had begun to gather about him a number of men, including Jafar-abu-Timman, who shared his disliking for the constant use of martial law, the abuses in the distribution of State lands, the provocative display of wealth, in the shape of houses and motor cars, by high Government servants and so on. All those to whom fortune had denied such blessings as these were ready to rally round him, but their awe of the Government kept them dumb. 13. It is to be assumed that it was at this stage that he took the course of turning for help to Bekr Sidqi, who, either because he shared these views, or more probably because he saw a chance of gratifying his personal ambitions, threw in his lot with Hikmat Sulaiman. It was a dangerous course, but it is to be presumed that a man like the new Prime Minister did not take it without forethought. 14. While I hope that what I have written above, speculative though it be, may serve to present to you an outline both of the causes of the recent upheaval and of what it may lead to, I feel that it would be wrong to end on too pessimistic a note. If the new Government are lucky, they may succeed in serving Iraq well. If they are not, the generals may take over. But even that may not prove to be so disastrous as we, with our inborn dislike of militarism, naturally fear. 15.

There has been marked inclination to seek and to follow advice of the embassy and officials. But there has not been time as yet to test the Govern- ment’s attitude towards any major outstanding questions« (B) While there still remains the formidable shadow of Bekir Sidki this has so far made no show of the stuff behind it. Indeed in his favour it must be said that he has deliberately kept himself aloof from politics. According to General Hay the changes he has made in appointments of Staff and Commamding oificers have sound military reasons. He shows much more readiness than his predecessors to «onsuit and co-operate with Military Mission. He called openly upon Jafar Pasha’s brother and offered condolences. (C) As time goes on the army tends s I am told, to come in solidly behind Bekir Sidki. The risk of a split which seemed to hold the promise of such grave dangers is therefore lessening. But il he can count upon the whole of the army it is clear that he can if he wishes to do so upset HikmatVs or any other government. At present his relations with Hikmat seems to be of the best but if history of his past is to be allowed to shed light upon his character it may be that he is merely biding his time, de can only wait and see.

Naji Shevket, the Iraqi Minister here, has informed me that, after the coup d’Etat, he impressed on Hikmet Suleyman, the new Iraqi Prime Minister, who is one of his relatives, the vital necessity of taking no action to disturb the relations between Iraq and Great Britain on the one hand, ana Iiaq and Turkey on the other. Hikmet Suleyman welcomed this advice, and authorised M. Naji Shevket to issue a communique, which was published by the Anadolu News Agency on the 8 th November, and of which I enclose a copy. It contains assurances that no such disturbance of relations will take place as a result of the change of Government in Iraq. According to M. Naji Snevket, other diplomatic iepie- sentatives of Iraq abroad have been informed of the terms of the communique by their Government. 2 The Iraqi Minister described Hikmet Suleyman as a sensible man oi moderate views, who, however, would prefer to resign, rather than have to react energetically against a policy which others might force on him, and of which he might not approve. ^ . , . , , 3 .

WITH reference to Mr. Bateman’s despatch N o. 462 of the 17th September last, I have the honour to inform you that the Prime Minister carried out his proposed visit to the northern liwas between the 15th and 24th September. His Excellency’s tour, which included Mosul, Arbil and Sulaimani, seems to have been both popular and successful, and on his return he told Mr. Bateman that he was determined to take effective measures to relieve the poverty of the villagers, by whose low standard of living he had been painfully shocked. It is unfortunate, therefore, that this tour, which was undertaken with such good intentions, should have involved the Prime Minister in some slight passing difficulties with King Ghazi. 2. In spite of the fact that the Prime Minister consulted him before leaving Bagdad, His Majesty seems to have felt that Yasin had stolen his thunder by preceding him to the north. H is Majesty’s pique was prompted by Hikm at Sulaiman and others of the OppoS lttbn, but 1 now learn that he is entirely satistied That YasIu’s^visit was a bona fide effort to clear the way, and to make sure that the Royal visit would not be marred by any untoward incident. 3. Early in the present week King Ghazi visited the holy cities of Kerbala and Najaf. He moved freely about amongst the fanatical populace, and was most cordially received. This would not have been possible a few months ago, and I am convinced that the King must thank the diplomacy and tact of his Prime Minister for the happy outcome of this excursion. As plans have been made for a Royal visit to Basra during the next few days, and probably, later in the year, for a journey to the north of Iraq also, it is clear that His Majesty is treading the path laid down for him by Yasin Pasha during the summer. 4. Meanwhile, arrangements are being made for the next parliamentary session, which begins on the 1st November. Seven by-elections have to be held to fill vacancies in the Chamber, and some Cabinet changes also seem likely. The Prime Minister told me soon after my return to Bagdad that recently the King had several times indicated that he thought that the time had come to reshuffle the Cabinet portfolios, and had even hinted that it was desirable that Jaiar-al- Askeri and Nuri Said should resign. As new Ministers, His Majesty had spoken of Jamal Madfai and Muhammad Zaki (now President of the Chamber). Yasin admitted that he had himself for some time thought that the Cabinet would have to be reorganised before Parliament met, but he was not prepared to turn out Nuri, whose energy and resourcefulness were great assets. Moreover, if were made to resign just after his intervention in Palestinian affairs, it would appear that the Iraqi Government did not approve of what he had done, and an unfortunate impression might be created in Palestine and other Arab countiies. I said that I entirely agreed with him, and should be very sorry to see the Yasm- Nuri partnership break up. ,, 5. I mentioned the possibility of early Cabinet changes to Nun, and he told me that, since his return, Yasin had given him a similar account of the position, and had asked him to make suggestions for the reorganisation of the Cabinet after he had had time to get into touch with the different political leaders. Nun explained that, owing to his son’s marriage, he had not yet had time to study the situation and in any case he would be reluctant to discuss the personnel of the Cabinet with the Prime Minister. If, however, Yasin Pasha mentioned the matter to him again, he intended to point out some of the defects of the Govern ment’s internal policy, which, he thought, should be remedied. The most conspicuous of these was the deterioration of the provincial administration, the efficiency of which had, he considered, steadily declined since the British [856 b—1], i i ip his opinion, it was essential to administrative inspectors had been re vinces in suc h a manner as to restore reorganise the admmistration oi attitude towards the question of effective British advice. ilom ® k ^ich he made to me the same evening, Cabinet changes, and from several ^ j ress i on that a certain coolness had when he dined at the Embassy. 1 gained me t developed between Nuri and Yasin night, and the Prime Minister 6 Both of them dined vi f w ’ a bout the reconstruction told me that he had that day as , ^uri little disposed to express any at of the Cabinet. He had, howe Jf’ f ° u f/ U H e depended so much upon Nun’s all, and this was an embarrass i , reluctant to make any changes which presence in the Government th q f wouM terelucta ^ Aff i rs . fe e added did not have the full ^tefl me that King Ghazi was reconciled to Nuri’s that he was glad to be ab e Nur . left th | Embassy I took an opportunity lo“I that 1 thought it S ^^' 01 Irfs“ht S s°u“Sto find the office of honest broker falling upon me once again which 1 discussed with the Prime Minister soon after mv return was the situation on the Euphrates. He told me that the tribes were nuieter but still restless, and that the situation continued to cause anxe y. In a Me over a week after this conversation, the police, supported by the Iraqi An Force were obliged to undertake operations against the Safran tribe a few miles north east of Samawa. I have not yet been able to ascertain the precise cause 0 thTs fresh outbreak of tribal disorder, but it is. evidently closely connected whi the disturbances at Khidr, which were reported m paragraph 7 of Mi Bateman s desnatch No. 441 of the 27th August last. The feafran are a section o. the turbulent Bani Hachaim, and it appears that certain elements of the tribe w re not brought to submission by the operations undertaken at the ena ot An list. Fortunately, the disorder does not seem to be spreading, and I hear that the Iraqi aeroplanes have now been withdrawn to Bagdad, as it is considered that the police are able to deal with the situation alone. , j • + ^ 8 . As bad administration is obviously the cause of the present disturbed state of the Diwaniyah and Muntafiq liwas, the proper remedy is quiet, orderly and even-handed government, but the tendency of the Iraqi Ministers is always to use force, plus blundering political moves, as a panacea for all tribal disorders. These methods, it is true, frequently relieve the symptoms, but seldom eradicate the cause of the disease, which, after a while, usually breaks out again in an aggravated form. Nor is it the Ministers alone who act in bhis mannei. The practice of applying political rather than administrative expedients to the solution of current problems is also common in all public departments. Ignorance and laziness are the chief causes of this state of affairs. To work out sound administrative reforms requires a degree of knowledge and experience, patience and diligence seldom possessed by Iraqi officials, and, in consequence, those in authority constantly fall back upon their inborn craft to provide solutions for their difficulties. The result is a steady deterioration in the efficiency of the ,• 1 • 1 ' 1 — - l1 -- ^ in the their difficulties.

The latter informed me that, as regards this proposal, he was getting some amusement from the rumours spread by his adversaries to the effect that there was a difference of opinion on the question whether the King’s visit should precede the Trime Minister s or vies vBusa. He said that provided he could go before he became involved in the storms and stresses of parliamentary life, it was a matter of indifference to him when he went, but that the real crux of the matter was that the King declined to move until his new aeroplane was ready for the trip. He had impressed upon His Majesty (and has asked me to do the same) that during the proposed visit he should be most circumspect and forth coming in his talks and dealings with the local notables. It will be remembered that in 1934 the King’s tour in the north left much to be desired, because of the cavalier treatment which he meted out to tribal leaders. 8. There can, I think, be little doubt that this unprecedented Government activity during the summer months affords proof that a hectic parliamentary session is expected in the autumn.

He said that he fully realised the danger inherent in part ayed by the army in his coming into office and was determined to se no time in pushing the army back into its proper place.

Mr. Bateman to Mr. Ed 7732 \n.— temper Section 1. Copy No. J17 7-) (No. Sir, Bagdad, August 27, 1936. THE political calm of the past few weeks was disturbed on the 12th August by the reappearance and immediate suspension of the vernacular newspaper Sawt-al-Ahali (The Voice of the People). This organ has always been note worthy for the violence of its language and the virulence of its attacks upon the Government. Its career has consequently been chequered. On more than one occasion it has been suspended as a result of representations by His Majesty’s Embassy, and on the 12th August it endeavoured to emerge from a year’s enforced silence, under the control of Hikmat Sulaiman and Jafar-abu-Timmun. 2. These men, who have in the past occupied seats in the Cabinet and wield a good deal of influence, were formerly friends of the Prime Minister. Having now quarrelled with him, they signified their reappearance from comparative obscurity by launching an attack on him and the Minister of the Interior for their share in negotiating the Railway Agreement with His Majesty’s Govern ment, which, they said, bound the Iraqi Government hand and foot to the British, and afforded evidence of the fact that their former friends had abandoned all the principles for which they stood when in opposition. By way of illustration, they declared that the Iraqi Government had entered into a secret agreement with His Majesty’s Government whereby all material during the remaining period of the railway’s bondage would be purchased in the L T nited Kingdom. Hikmat Sulaiman, it will be remembered, had similarly reproached the Government in the Bayar, a newspaper over which he had secured control last April. 3. The Government had apparently received warning of the contents of the leading article in Sawt-al-Ahali. Early in the morning of the 12th August the police raided the paper’s offices and confiscated all the extant copies of the issue. I am told, however, that Hikmat Sulaiman had secreted a certain number and himself sold them in the streets. However that may be, a few copies were smuggled out, and were to be had in the bazaar at Is. each. Sawt-al-Ahah was promptly suspended for a further year. , ^ ^ wn Pin-Elv 4. A few days later, Hikmat Sulaiman and Jafar-abu-Timmu , incensed, were received by the King, to whom the)/ pioteste the action of the Government in suppressing what they cQHSidered to be legitmate criticism. The King listened sympathetically to then comp ’ , ^ . ag no encouragement, possibly because Hikmat Sulaiman, a eas ’ . during- the careful as he might have been in his criticism of the Hashimite family du g excitement caused by the affair of Princess Azzah. i j prime 5.

Here he seems to have been at pains to be gracious and generous. He has made the necessary airangements for repairs to certain mosques and shrines/and went out of his way to convey his personal condo lences to the family and pupils of Naim, a leading mujtahid, who died a short time ago These activities have given great satisfaction, and in conversation with me soon after his return, the 'Prime Minister seemed relieved and confident as to the future. Unfortunately, he had to admit that military action had again become necessary in the Samawa district. It appears that nomad tribesmen on the 22nd August attacked a newly-established police post in a marshy district near Khedr, between Samawa and Ur of the Chaldees. A patrol sent to aid the post was also attacked. Two policemen were killed, and as a result of punitive air and ground action, twenty-five tribesmen are said to have shuffled off this mortal coil. Air action is still proceeding, but the Prime Minister regarded the whole affair as sporadic, and as in no way part of a concerted movement. 8 . As regards the future, much must depend upon the personal relations existing between Yasin Pasha and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Nuri Pasha seems bent these days on dashing abroad, and always has a good excuse for doing so. He is, however, more ‘ £ settled 5 ’ of late, and seems to be genuinely anxious to turn his foreign visits to good account. The Prime Minister shares this anxiety, and although badly in need of a change of scene himself, is ready to give Nuri Pasha all the scope and support he needs. I do not think that he will try to bask in Nuri’s glory if, in fact, anything comes of the negotiations at Jerusalem, in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs is trying to bring about a detente between Arab and Jew, or in the unlikely event of Nuri’s being successful in effecting a frontier settlement with the Iranian Government. I have the impression that the two are working in greater harmony, and that they are sticking to the bargain which they made in June with the blessing of His Majesty’s Ambassador. 9.

I have the honour to report that Saiyid Mahmud, Naqib-m-AslTraf of Bagdad and trustee of the Qadiriyah Awqaf, died in Bagdad in the early morning of the 21 st July after a long illness. 2. At the funeral, which took place at 5 o’clock in the evening of the same day, King Ghazi was represented by the Master of Ceremonies. Most of the Cabinet Ministers and many members of the Diplomatic Corps attended. 3 . On the 27th July Royal Iradahs were issued appointing Saiyid Asim-al- Qilani as Naqib-al-Ashraf of Bagdad, and Saiyid Rasliid Ali-al-Gilani trustee of the Qadiriyah Awqaf (i.e., the endowments of the shrine and mosque of Sheikh Abdul Qadir-al-Gilani in Bagdad). 4. Asim is the eldest surviving brother of the late Saiyid Mahmud, and Rashid Ali, who belongs to a junior branch of the family, is the present Minister of the Interior. . ... 5 . Both of these appointments are likely to give rise to criticism. Saiyid Asim is a respected and venerable man, who, although of no great talent, will probably fill adequately the post of Naqib; but there is little doubt that the late Naqib’s son—Saiyid Muhammad Jamal-al-Din—-had hoped to succeed his father. For the past twenty years he has lived in India, where he has kept alive the influence of the Gilani family in Baluchistan and in the Chitial Valley. He has I am told, married a daughter of the ruling Mehtar of Chitral. Two months ago hearing of Saivid Mahmud’s illness, he came to Bagdad, and is now no doubt, aggrieved that he lias not been appointed to step into his father s shoes. I or this reason it is not improbable that he may encourage m India criticism of is uncle’s appointment. I am assured, however, that there is no m ® Shara or Civil Law which makes the post of Naqib hereditary, and that the Government have full right to appoint whomsoever 6 . But the feature of the new arrangements which is likely to arouse most comment is the separation of the functions of Naqib from tho f f ^ of the Qadiriyah endowments. Phis, I am informed, has iaiely, ’ PP , before The strict legality of the innovation is perhaps open to some doubt, but Can ’ 1 a ^ d fSreKNa ql b-Sa lyld Abdul Rahman—-an effort was made by a group of the Gilam family to take the administration oUhe endowments out of the hands of \ s . ? u0 . c f 1 W f® “^at tiSe the High leader of this movement ^ question of the succession might Isfamtc^counkle^anTpartiOTlarlyAn IndiVhe /^g-^g^utra^to Secret A ’ t0 the Secretary of State for the Colonies, da e ii tendered similar advice to the 8 .

Outside Iraq, the presence of Saiyid Asim as Naqib should preserve religious propriety, and, provided no hindrance is created for pilgrims to the shrine, the murids, dervishes and other adherents of the Qadiriyah house should have no real cause for complaint. 10. Telegrams and petitions protesting against the new arrangements and inspired by one or other of the several groups with special material interests at stake may be sent to His Majesty’s representatives in India and this country (I have already received a telegram of protest from one branch of the Gilani family), but in present circumstances I can see no good reason for intervention of any kind by His Majesty’s Government, The position in 1927 was entirely different. The mandate was still in force, and the High Commissioner rightly foresaw that if anything were done to offend Islamic settlement (particularly in India), His Majesty’s Government would have to shoulder the responsibility and take the blame. In these days we have no responsibility for matters of this kind and, moreover, no locus standi for intervention. 11 . Unless I am instructed to the contrary, I propose, therefore, to ignore as far as possible, any representations which may be made to me about the appointment of Asim and Rashid Ali or about the separation of the trusteeship from the Niqabat; and in instances where some reply seems unavoidable, to state frankly that these matters are no longer the concern of His Majesty’s Government. 12 .

Muzahim Pachachi has returned from Rome, but I have not heard what account he has given of his efforts to have Princess Azzah’s marriage annulled. In any case his return has been allowed to pass without undue comment, and the Rais of the Royal Diwan recently expressed to me a fervent hope that the whole affair might now be relegated to the limbo of forgotten things ,. f f S 2 Meanwhile the Prime Minister is working steadily at his task ol restoring public affection for King Ghazi.

[E 4162/3089/93] Copy No. Mr. Bateman to Mr. Eden.—(Received July 6 .) (No. 312.) Sir, Bagdad, June 25, 1936. WITH reference to Sir A. Clark Kerr’s despatch No. 297, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of an ordinance concerning the Royal family which was issued on the 13th June last. 2. The ordinance, in addition to defining the conditions of membership of the Royal family, provides for the establishment of a council which is empowered, in certain circumstances, to deprive members of the Royal family of their rights and titles. 3. It is expected that steps will now be taken to deprive Princess Azzah of such rights as she inherited as the daughter of King Feisal. There is considerable head-shaking amongst the wiseacres of Bagdad as to the legality of any such procedure. There is even a fear expressed that, as the Princess is now an Italian subject, the Italian Government may have something to say if any attempt is made to deprive the Princess of her inherited properties. 4. Meanwhile, the King’s household is being purged of what are considered to be its undesirable elements. Tahsin Kadri, the Master of Ceremonies, has been posted as counsellor to the Iraqi Legation in Tehran, and replaced in the palace by Dr. Naji-al-Asil. The military aides-de-camp have all been sent back to their units, and successors carefully chosen for their integrity and high moral standards. Below stairs there has been a clean sweep of the servants and new ones have been engaged, who, it is hoped, will not encourage or facilitate the repetition of the delinquencies which have given rise to so much criticism of the palace over the past three years.

Art. 10.—( 1 ) If a prince or princess commits any act derogatory to the honour of the Royal family, the council may decide for his or her expulsion from the family, in which case such prince or princess and his or her descendants shall be deprived of the princely title, and such prince shall also be deprived of his right of succession to the throne. ( 2 ) The council may in addition decide— (a) To deprive such prince or princess of any right which may pass to him or her as a member of the Royal family, including the right of inheritance from the King or from any member of the Royal family. (b) To prohibit his or her entry into Iraq or residence therein. (c) To deprive him or her of the right to exercise possession of immovable property in Iraq. (3) The council shall dispose in such manner as they deem proper of property of which a prince or princess has been deprived under the preceding clauses. J r£. 11.

A week ago, when Nuri Said received me at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, he was extremely gloomy and talked pessimistically about the hopelessness of the political future. A revolver lay significantly on his table and I found it necessary to use most soothing language to bring him to see that all was not necessarily lost and that possibly he himself was partly responsible for his own dejection. Nor was he the only Minister to go through the motions of self-protection and to carry fire-arms. 3 . During the last few days, however, Ministers have become less agitated and there is less talk of radical changes in the personnel of the Cabinet. The death of the Princess is no longer put forward as being the only possible solution. 4. Nevertheless, the repercussions of this affair have added to the difficulties of the Government, whose position had already been shaken by the tribal revolts at Rumaitha and Dagharah, the closing events of which I have reported in my despatch No. 328 of to-day’s date. 5 . The efforts of the Prime Minister to restore King Ghazi’s prestige are not meeting with the support from certain quarters which he was ^ entitled to expect. The King is offering some resistance to the Government s plans for the reform of his household. He has, for example, refused to dismiss one, Saivid Shakir, the Keeper of the Privy Purse, and I understand that he is trying to restore to his service a chauffeur whose notoriously immoral conduct put him at the head of the index expurgatorius prepared on the Prime 7 EASTERN (Iraq).

WITH reference to my despatch No. 299 of the 20th June last, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith the text of an official communique of the 22nd June announcing the surrender of Sheikh Shalan-al-Atiyah and the collapse of the Euphrates revolt/ 1 2 * 4 ). The communique ends on a note of optimism which, in present circumstances, can hardly be said to be warranted. From the military point of view, there may be room for satisfaction that the army has, on the whole, come well out of the ordeal, but there are not a few who are dismayed by the evidence of a serious breakdown in the administrative machine afforded by the Government’s constant recourse to force over the past fifteen months. 2. The only positive step to be taken in the near future appears to be the disarming of the tribes in the affected area. There is no mention of a serious effort by the Minister of the Interior to sift the tribesmen’s grievances and deal honestly with them. On the contrary, I hear that the new mutessarif of Diwaniyah is, with difficulty, being restrained from reopening complicated tribal land disputes, while some of his subordinates are so inept as to be a source of constant preoccupation to those whose aim is the rapid restoration of normal conditions. , ^ ^ r ^ • 3 It seems to be unfortunately true that the Minister of the Interior is a man of warped vision and vindictive disposition. He is said to be unable to appreciate any views but his own. In the present instance, his inclination o opportunist and hasty methods is causing no little concern to some of his colleagues in the Government. The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Defence are openly critical of his methods and the Cabinet are said to be sharply divided as to the course to be taken in the immediate future. 4 .

WITH reference to my despatch No. 254 of the 22nd May, I have the honour to inform you that there has been little change during the last week in the situation on the Euphrates. 2. The Government serai at Afaj (20 miles east of Diwaniyah) was sniped on the night of the 23rd or 24th May. This caused some anxiety lest the Afaj tribes should rise, and a mixed brigade of the Iraqi army was moved from the Rumaitha area to Diwaniyah to be ready to deal with them. Up to the present, however, nothing further has happened at Afaj. 3 . A train was fired on at Wawiyah (midway between Rumaitha and Samawah) on the 29th May and Iraqi aeroplanes were sent to demonstrate over the area. 4 . Two of the important leaders of the Dhuwalim are, I am told, still refusing to surrender, but it is said that they cannot remain at large much longer. There has been no further fighting, but it appears that the hostile state of the tribes makes a return to normal conditions impossible. The troops are in the towns and in their picquets, but the administrative machine is at a standstill. ... 5 . The Prime Minister, whom I saw to-day, remains optimistic and apparently unperturbed either by the tribal situation on the Euphrates or bv the many rumours in circulation about the plots of the Opposition. Whether the further course of events will be enlivened or come to stagnation through midsummer lethargy the next few weeks will probably show. 6 I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran.

( Na 254 ' ) - Bagdad, May 22, 1936. U I HAVE the honour to report that, since the date of my despat ch No. 245 of the 14th May, there has been little military activity of importance m the disturnm area about Rumaitha. The forces concentrated there have been divided into three columns, based respectively on Rumaitha, Abu Tabikh (10 miles north o Rumaitha), and Aridhat (between Abu Tabikh and Rumaitha), and are at presen engaged in minor punitive operations against the rebel tribesmen. Practically iio°opposition has been encountered for some days. Numerous villages have been destroyed and large areas of crops burned. Some stories of brutality on the part of the troops are now beginning to reach Bagdad. Few prisoners have, it seems, been taken, and there are the usual rumours of the shooting out of hand of parties of surrendering tribesmen with their womenfolk. I am not at present m a position to assess the truth of such reports, but they do not seem to be out o harmony with Bakr Sidqi’s reputation for ruthlessness. ^ i i ,i 2. The Minister of the Interior (Rashid Ali) returned to Bagdad on the 14th May and appeared to be well satished with his work at Diwaniyah What exactly he did there is not known to me, but it is said that he worked hard to keep other neighbouring tribes from joining the revolt and that he spent money l a vis y to this end. His efforts seem, I am bound to say, to have been successful, for, although small detachments of sympathisers from other tribes have taken part m the fighting, the revolt in the main was confined to the septs of the Bam Huchaim Confederation. , ^ ^ £ 3 The Prime Minister, whom I saw on the 17th May on my return from a visit to MosuP, told me that all the important chieftains of the insurgent tribe? had submitted, and that the revolt might be considered to be at an end. home thirty of the sheikhs would, he said, be tried by court-martial m a few days, but the rank and file had been punished enough by their losses in action, ibis time, he added, there would be no general amnesty such as he had granted last year a few weeks after the military court had finished its work. If that sort of thing were done habitually, martial law would lose its salutary effect. He had instructed the court carefully to sift all the evidence, with a view to establish the real cause of the trouble. In his opinion, malicious agitators were mainly responsible, and he hoped that the court would expose and punish them. He was referring to the local Shiah clergy, and he said that if guilt weie eventually traced to them they would be shown no mercy. t * 4. He also told me that the Government were working out a plan for scattering the rebel tribesmen among less turbulent elements, and giving then lands to others whose loyalty could be better counted upon. It was intended, also, completely to disarm those tribal septs who were mainly responsible foi the disorders 5. I mentioned that I had heard that a deputation of a number of men prominent in public life had recently visited the Ring in order to protest against the severity of the Government s treatment of the rebels, and I asked whet ei this was true. His Excellency told me that Naji Suwaidi, Hikmat Sulaiman, Jafar Chalabi Abu Timman, Jamil Madfai, Maulud Mukhlis, Abdul Aziz Qassab, and one or two others had composed this deputation, and had complained bitter y to His Majesty about the constant bloodshed to which, they alleged, the policy of the Government was leading. According to the Prime Minister, King G azi gaxe [706 ee—1]them no encouragement, and affirmed his entire confidence in his Ministers fit. Majesty was, the Prime Minister said, piqued by the deputation’s slmhtiJ references to the army. 6. Yassin-al-Hashimi himself made light of these activities on the part of the Opposition and professed to be generally optimistic. He called my attention to the loyalty to the Government of the vast majority of the Euphrates tribes, an 4 he claimed that, once the Government had cleared up the present situation, thy country would be so quiet that even a fool like Jamil Madfai would have no difficulty in keeping office for as long as ten years. My information from other sources does not altogether justify the Prime Minister’s optimism. 7. It is apparently true that most if not all of the rebel sheikhs have surrendered, but the tribes between Diwaniyah and Samawa remain in a dangerous state of ferment, and it seems to me that time and more patience and understanding than are usually shown by the Government and their officials will be required to restore tranquillity. 8 . In his appreciation of the causes of the disorders, the Prime Minister also seems to me to be in error. That there were people who worked on the temper of the tribes is more than likely, and that many of these were probably Shiah clergy of various grades is undeniable. But the root causes of the revolt must, in my opinion, be sought far deeper than in the frothy agitation of such men as these. It is still somewhat difficult to analyse, with any certainty, the discontent which found expression in the recent rebellion, but there is little doubt that the chief ingredients were a number of injudicious acts on the part of the Government themselves, among which partiality in dealing with tribal land disputes, conscription, and the prohibition of the usual mourning processions during the last Muharram celebrations take a prominent place. At the Prime Minister’s own suggestion, Mr. Edmonds is preparing a comprehensive note on this question a copy of which I hope to be able to send to you in due course. Mr. Edmonds tells me that he is expressing his views with a frankness which will, I fear, make his note unpalatable reading for the Cabinet. 9. I think his Excellency is equally at fault in disdaining the activities of the Opposition. There is little doubt that the Government are losing popularity. This is partly due to a natural process familiar in all countries where any form of parliamentary institutions exists. To a far greater extent, however, it must be attributed to the uneasiness, and in some instances the disgust, which has been caused by the Government’s constant use of arms to impose their will upon the country. Many people have been shocked by the loss of life and the general devastation caused by the present Euphrates operations. Jamil Madfai would not be human if he did not make the most of the situation in order to discredit Yassin-al-Hashimi and his colleagues, and, as I reported in my despatch under reference, I think that the Prime Minister’s position has been shaken. It is rumoured that he has sent for both Nuri-al-Said and Naji Shaukat (the Iraqi Minister at Angora) to return to support him in dealing with the Cabinet’s present difficulties. The fact that Nuri is leaving England earlier than was expected may be confirmation of this story, but I have as yet no news that Naji Shaukat has actually left Angora. It should not, however, be assumed that the Government have now no friends. There are strong influences, both in Bagdad and the provinces, which support them, and sincerely applaud the severity with which they are dealing with the rebels. They have also succeeded in keeping the press unanimously on their side. 10 . In regard to the general temper of the Euphrates tribes, I consider that the Prime Minister is again over-optimistic in believing that they are so solidly loyal to his Administration. He seems to have accepted at their face value the hurried protestations of obedience given to the Minister of the Interior by intimidated sheikhs summoned to administrative headquarters, and to have turned a blind eye to the signs of widespread restlessness and discontent which are patent to all those in touch with current events in the south of Iraq. Above all, he seems to ignore the notorious fickleness of these tribesmen, whose support of a leader or a cause is never anything but the most evanescent enthusiasm. 11. Nor can I readily believe that the scheme which he outlined to me for uprooting the rebels and giving their lands to other tribes will contribute to the tranquillity of these disturbed areas. Indeed, it appears to me to be an unsound plan. For the Government themselves to confiscate a tribe’s lands is generally3a % tie! unwise • to hand over these lands to tribal rivals or enemies is to sow the seeds ot endless' strife and disorder. I propose to seek an early opportunity to discuss this project with Mr. Edmonds, and to see whether something can be done to modify the Government’s intentions. _ _ . , ^ 12.

Clark Kerr to Mr. Eden.—(Received July 2.) (No. 297. Confidential.) Sir, , Bagdad, June 19, 1936. I HAVE the honour to refer to the series of telegrams y/hich I have sent to you during the last few days concerning the political effects in Iraq of the marriage of Princess Azzah. The first and acute phase of the affair now seems to be past, and the present is probably a good moment at which to tell the early chapters of what may possibly be a long story. 2. It was some ten days or so before news of the princess’s elopement reached Bagdad, for the Government were at pains to exclude any reference to it from the local press. But they v/ere unsuccessful in their efforts to prevent foreign newspapers containing full reports from finding their way into Iraq, and in due course the princess’s adventure became the main topic of conversation throughout the country. 3. While for a foreigner it was hard at first to measure it, there can now be no doubt about the damage done to the reputation of the Hashimite family and, in particular, to the personal prestige of King Ghazi. In the face of the flight of his sister, a daughter of the house of the Prophet, with an hotel servant and of her apostasy from Islam, the first popular reaction was one of dismay and of indignation with the princess herself. The second and the more violent was one of hot anger with her brother, King Ghazi. To the everyday and uninformed European this might well seem unreasonable, but to the Iraqi it was natural and inevitable, and for it His Majesty was himself to blame. Had he enjoyed even a modest share of the respect and affection commanded by his father, the offence of his sister would have drawn to him the sympathy of the whole country. But he had been foolish. His absorption in his private hobbies had led him into a heedlessness of the welfare and the susceptibilities of his subjects and indifference to affairs of State which had become notorious. And, still more, even amongst a people by no means and by no right queasy about human frailties, a penny plain or twopence coloured, his mode of life had long been a cause for whispered scandal and had served to make the Iraqis hold him in aversion. What had been whispered about him before now became the subject of the common talk of the coffee shops, and of talk of such a kind as to bring His Majesty into contempt. Thus the main odium provoked by his sister’s escapade fell upon King Ghazi himself. 4. Among tribal Arabs such a stain as that left by Princess Azzah upon the family honour can only be wiped out by the blood of both the man and the woman. Often in this country women and their lovers are killed by outraged male relations for misdemeanours less serious than the present one. The murderers come in for popular praise and are dealt with lightly in the courts. But in this instance the culprits are far away from Iraq and vengeance in the classic tradition offers many difficulties. 5. From the beginning it was clear that the Government and the Court were greatly upset. But it has been only within the last few days that the Prime Minister has admitted to me the extent of his concern, which has been deepened by the unhelpful and even reckless attitude of Nuri Said. 6 . Early on the morning of the 15th June Yasin telephoned to me to ask me to see him about an urgent matter. Tie came to the Embassy at 9 o clock. He was plainly much perturbed. He began by speaking of Nuri, who had just returned from Europe. He said that experience had shown that, from time to time, Nuri adopted, and put forward as his own, ideas suggested to him by others, and he gave me one or two instances of what he meant. Yasin added that he mentioned this because it was widely believed that Nuri often gave voice to^ the views of this Embassy. Since his return from Europe on the 12th June, Nun, [756 b— 1 ] B jin discussing with some of his colleagues the situation created by the affa' Princess Azzah, had argued that the Royal Family had been so disgraced there was nothing for it but to depose King Ghazi and to set up a Council that Regency to govern the country until the infant Crown Prince came of age' y ' explained that, when this came to his knowledge, he had discussed the &amp; matter 8 private with Rashid Ali, who had agreed with him that the course advocated bv Nuri would be disastrous. They had, however, both thought that Nuri’s vie ' ^ might have had their origin in suggestions made to him either in your Deuart' ment, during his recent visit to London, or by myself in Bagdad. Yasin recalled that, within the last ten days or so, I had questioned him about King Ghazi’ position, and said that he had decided to ask me frankly whether Nuri’s idea had been inspired by His Majesty’s Government. 7. He went on to explain that, in his opinion, any plot to set King Ghazi aside would expose the country to the danger of general anarchy. In Iraq no one trusted anyone else, each one was jealous of his neighbour, and it would be impossible to find a group of men who commanded respect or authority enough to be able to rule as Regents without exciting the envy and hostility of a number of dangerous rivals. If King Ghazi were deposed, a struggle for power would be sure to follow and the country would be brought to ruin. One had only to think how such a state of things would be exploited by the Shiah and Kurdish tribes in order to realise to what disasters the step which Nuri proposed would lead. I replied that I felt bound to agree that he had rightly described the situation which would be likely to arise, and I said that I shared his views about Nuri’s plan. 8 . Yasin then said that he understood that Nuri had even gone so far as to suggest that he (Yasin) himself should be Regent. Such an idea was as ill- judged in itself as it was repugnant to him personally. He had no wish whatever to become Regent. Indeed, if he were to, he would certainly be accused of having engineered the disgrace of the princess in order to usurp supreme power. 9. I said that I had received no record of any conversation which Nuri Pasha might have had at the Foreign Office concerning the marriage of the princess, and that I could confidently assure his Excellency that it was out of the question that even a hint of such an idea as deposing King Ghazi could have been given to Nuri without my having been informed. 10 . I then asked the Prime Minister to tell me to what extent, in his view, King Ghazi’s position had been damaged by the marriage. Yasin replied that public feeling was running so high that it might be difficult for King Ghazi to hold his own unless his honour were speedily retrieved. It was His Majesty’s first and obvious duty to kill his sister with his own hand. His lost honour could not properly be regained by means of a hired assassin. If King Ghazi killed the princess promptly, he could hold up his head again and look people in the face. Otherwise, as time went on, his position might become so shaken as to be beyond saving. The Prime Minister spoke without excitement, choosing his words with deliberation. 11 . I replied that much of what he said, both about the gravity of the shock to King Ghazi’s prestige and the pitiless method of restoring it, was confirmed by what I had recently heard elsewhere. I thought it my urgent duty to warn him that public opinion outside Iraq, which, I was sure he would agree, could not be ignored, would look at the affair in a different light. Morganatic marriages had become commonplace among some Royal families of Europe, and nowadays little or no stigma attached to them. For a few days the “ romance” of the story was given prominence in the press, and then it was quickly forgotten. On the other hand, if His Majesty murdered his sister, no matter what justifi cation there might be for such an act under Arab custom, he would so horrify the civilised world that he would be disgraced for ever. 12. The Prime Minister listened attentively and then said that he had been turning over in his mind the possible and, in his view, the inadequate alternative of securing the annulment of the marriage and the return of the princess to her own country. The Iraqi Minister at Rome had, in fact, already made a special appeal in King Ghazi’s name to King Victor Emmanuel and Signor Mussolini to have the marriage annulled, and had received a not discouraging reply. I enquired what would be done with the princess if she were brought back to Iraq. The Prime Minister replied that she would be declared to be insane and shut up.

There was, therefore, nothing to be gained by Null’s scheme It the Yame time, he realised that, if he cared to pursue his plans Nuri could carry a large body of opinion with him, for it would be a simple matter toTnflame popular pLions against King Ghazi. But since the acciden to his son Nuri be felt, had been nervous and distraught, and seemed to have los his tonse of proportion. Yasin therefore begged me to use my influence with Nuri to bring him to his senses. No mention, he said, should be made of our present talk, lor Nuri would be sure to put his plan to me. I readily agreed to do this for I was persuaded that the Prime Minister was right. _ 15 ’ My visit to Nuri the day after was the first I had paid to him since his return from Europe. I was disturbed by his appearance and his manner. He seemed to be but the shale and husk of himself and looser than ever, both in his thought and in the expression of it. As foreseen by 1 asm, he at once ra the subiect of the princess’s marriage. He said that he feared that the affair would utterly destroy King Ghazi’s 'reputatian. His Majesty’s way f hWas already well known and had damaged his prestige as King. What bad now happened might well be the final blow. As he saw it, public contempt for King Ghazi was likely soon to reach such a pitch that it might become impossible foi His Majesty any longer to carry out the duties of the Grown. With what face for instance could s5ch a King meet a situation which demanded the dismissal of a Government which had lost the confidence of the country? And how, m these circumstances, could an Administration which was abusing its position be removed from office except by coup d'Etat .Such perplexities as these had been occunying his mind night and day. He felt that it was imperative to do some- thins ;.' 7 Some clear-cut and unquestionable authority must be set up m the place of the King for this was essential to the Government of Iraq. For instance, the unruly elements in the country and all those with grievances had hitherto been able, as a last resort, to appeal to the throne for redress. Since King Feisal’s death this had not meant much, but it had acted m a way as a vent. I he vent had now become choked, and if it were not replaced an explosion mig e ^ 16 He then put to me somewhat incoherently his plans for a regency and asked for my views. I protested that this was a far-reaching proposal, and that if he wanted my views, he must develop it a little. He confessed that he had had time neither to study its practical implications nor to take Yasin into his confidence, and he spoke confusedly first of deposing King Ghazi and then of putting his prerogatives into commission. The rest was a tirade against His Majesty Ind his manner of life. When he drew breath I thought that the time had come to express disapproval of his plan and I used all th e ^gnments wffich Yasin and I had found against it the day before. I then said that I thought he should lose no time in discussing it with the Prime Minister, and I suggested that he and Yasin should dine with me at the Embassy on the following day and talk the whole matter over. Nuri agreed to do this, and added that he had [756 b—1] B 24 been distressed, since his return from Europe, to find the Prime Minister in a highly nervous condition, and really not to be trusted to give a reasoned opinion on any important matter. 17. If it be for me to judge between the two men, I feel bound to say that it seems to me to be Yasin who has kept his wisdom. 18. I then told Nuri that I had heard from people in authority, such as his own brother-in-law, Ja’far-al-Askeri, that in order to make his honour safe again King Ghazi must kill his sister. Nuri agreed that this was so. If i t were known in Iraq that the girl had been killed by King Ghazi or on His Majesty’s direct orders, his honour would be restored in all Arab countries. I lost no time in repeating to Nuri the solemn warning that I had given to Yasin He hedged a little, and said that it would not much matter who killed the princess so long as she died. Perhaps it would not shock the world so much if it could be made to appear outside Iraq that the murder had not been committed at Kim Ghazi’s direct instance. He was himself opposed to savagery of this kind, but the death of the princess was undoubtedly the ideal solution of the present problem. As regards the rest of the world, he appreciated that the effect would be unfortunate, but it must be remembered that King Ghazi had to reign in Irac and not in Europe. As our conversation went on, he agreed that if the princess were allowed to live and her marriage were dissolved, and if then, perhaps, sbe were shut up for a time somewhere in Europe, it was not improbable that public indignation would be to some extent quietened. In conclusion, Nuri said that he was telling me frankly of everything that had been passing in his mind, because it was obvious that His Majesty’s Government, having special interest in Iraq’s welfare, could not remain unconcerned in the face of such a situation. He was sure that the Iraqi Government would welcome, and be grateful for, any guidance which His Majesty’s Government might feel able to offer. 19. The Prime Minister and Nuri dined with me the day after. Yasin arrived first, and thanked me warmly for having spoken to Nuri, for what I had said had obviously shaken Nuri’s belief in his own plan. After I had left the Ministry for Foreign Affairs yesterday, Nuri had gone at once to Yasin, and had said that, in the course of his conversation with me, the idea of a regency had suddenly occurred to him, and he had thought that I would be the best person upon whom to test it. Nuri had, I gathered, somewhat dramatised what had passed between himself and me, for it seems that my reactions to his proposal had been remarkable. I had gone pale and averted my face, and had beaten my forehead with the palms of my hands. On recovering from what obviously must have been a great shock to me, I had used strong arguments against a regency, and all this had led him to the belief that it would probably be wiser to drop his plan. 20. When the time came to discuss the matter Nuri approached it with something of his old calm. I asked him if he had told the Prime Minister of his plan, and, on hearing that he had, I reiterated the arguments I had used to him the day before, and I said that, to my mind, the best course open to the Government was to purge the Royal household of the equivocal people with whom King Ghazi had chosen to surround himself, to establish strict control over His Majesty’s actions and movements, to keep him for a time in the background, and to hope that, with care and hard work, his reputation and authority would be restored in time and the unhappy story of his sister forgotten. 21. The Prime Minister said that he thought that I was possibly under estimating the extent to which King Ghazi had lost face during the last few days. It would be a very difficult task to restore his authority and redeem his reputation. Nevertheless, he agreed with me that this task should be attempted before other courses, such as the creation of a regency, were considered. He held strongly that it was impossible for Iraq to be governed without an effective Sovereign. Some man, standing above the parties and personalities, who could hold the balance in politics and be a court of appeal for those who felt wronged or oppressed was essential to Iraq, and, for this reason, his main purpose was to re-establish King Ghazi’s authority. 22. After rearguing, without much conviction, his proposal for a regency, Nuri was brought to acquiescence in the rough outline of policy which I had suggested. 23. The Prime Minister then pointed out that it was possible that the Government might find themselves in conflict with His Majesty over the ordering II Min'argmiE of his household and private life. Such a situation, unless handled with gieat Mrr might easily bring the Government into disfavour with King Ghazi, who would then be likely to lend himself to the intrigues of the Opposition designed to overthrow the Government. The chance of escaping irom the close restiamt to which it was proposed he should now be subjected might be a strong temptation 'A him to o-ive way x to the blandishments of the group of politicians under Jamil G adfai who were always hoping to slip back into office. Yasin added tnat at nresent’he believed that he still enjoyed King Ghazi’s goodwill and confidence, but, if this were withdrawn, it would be impossible for him to carry on the government of the country. , , •, 24 I said that I felt sure that his Excellency possessed tact and authority enough to equip him to deal with these difficulties. Here Nuri interrupted and, pointing at me, said: “It all really depends upon you and your Government. If you support us we shall succeed/' Yasin, who, as I have said, had kept his wisdom at once retorted that he had no wish to be in the position of having to depend upon British support. Friendly co-operation was one thing, dependence was something quite different. If it were known, or even widely believed, that he was dependent upon the Embassy, his influence and power would vanish at once On the other hand, he said, if Nuri remained his friend and worked with him, he could hope that his Cabinet would be strong enough to ward off the danger which seemed to be threatening, but if Nuri left him he knew well enough that he could not remain in office. Upon this the two Ministers pledged their 3 ]ovalty to each other with every evidence of sincerity. 25. It was no small pleasure to me to see this spontaneous declaration of allegiance made in my presence, for I had not forgotten that, when last the paths of these two men (upon whose co-operation the stability of Iraq seems to depend) threatened to diverge, the task of reconciliation had fallen upon me and I had been unable to persuade them to meet and discuss their differences, but had been obliged to fetch and carry between them. 26. Nuri then asked me if I would help by speaking to King Ghazi myself and Yasin took up this suggestion with enthusiasm. He begged that I should I tell His Majesty what his people were saying about him, for King Ghazi plainly r did not appreciate the extent to which his name had become a by-word in the country. Some friendly advice from myself, as Ambassador and as a spectator of events in Iraq, would be a valuable contribution to the solution of the present problem. This I agreed to do on the condition that I should be allowed to see His Majesty alone. ' 27. I then asked them about the princess. Did they think that public feeling against her conduct was dying down? To my astonishment Tasin clenched ^his fist, and, hammering out his words with blows on the arm of his chair, said : So long as Nuri and I and every other Iraqi who has felt this disgrace have breath m our bodies, we shall continue to wish for the death of that miserable girl. With vigour and feeling in harmony with his own, I spoke again of the deep horror with which the murder of the princess would be regarded throughout the civilised world. For a long while we threshed out every point in the case, and in the end I led them reluctantly away from thoughts of murder and back again to the less horrible alternative of the dissolution of the marriage and the temporary detention of the princess somewhere in Europe. Yasin maintained that she must be brought to Iraq so that the people might know that she was mad, but Nuri, with my support, urged that it would be enough that she should be shut up somewhere abroad for a while and later on perhaps released and allowed to disappear. 28. Yasin then asked whether His Majesty’s Government would help to bring about the dissolution of the marriage. I was purposely vague in my answer, first because I thought that such a request would be an embarrassment to you and then because I remembered that, when discussing the day before the return of the princess to Iraq, Yasin had still had murder at the back of his mind. 29. My conversation with King Ghazi was not as painful as I had expected. I like to think that I was gentle with him. In any case he took what I had to say in good part. He said that he had only just learned that his way of life had become a public scandal. Until now nobody had had the friendliness to come to him to give him any warning. I must not believe everything that was told me. All he had perhaps been guilty of was some harmless little indiscretions with servants to whom he was attached and he would certainly not repeat them. I iifafc...—mmrnmmmmmmmmmmmmi - said that it had occurred to n^e that perhaps public judgment would not hay been so harsh if His Majesty had given himself a little more trouble to enrio himself to his people, and I made a few suggestions as to how this should be do? Whether or not he recovered his prestige seemed to me to depend entirely U n himself. If I might venture to give him some advice, it was that he shouldVt himself for some time into the hands of his Ministers and closely foH ow guidance, for they had his welfare at heart. His Majesty assured me ? henceforth he would be scrupulously careful that nothing in his private 1 ? should expose him to criticism and that he^ would be guided by his Ministers He added that at the instance of the Prime Minister he had that day dismissed all his aides-de-camp, his two chauffeurs and nearly all his personal servants 30. King Ghazi then began to complain about the trouble into which the ill-considered action of his sister had brought him. This gave me an opportunity to tell him that I had heard it suggested that she should be killed, and I explained to him the impression which such a murder would make on the outside 1 world He said that he himself appreciated this, although many of those about him did not. In any case, the idea of murder was odious to him. When I was leavin? him His Majesty thanked me warmly for the advice I had given him, and said that he would always look upon me as a brother. 31. When later in the day I again saw the Prime Minister I found his Excellency’s temper almost buoyant. He told me that he had had talks with the leaders of the Opposition and had found that they were all in agreement with and ready to support the policy which he had decided to follow. He confessed to feeling much relieved. He said that he now had good hopes that the political trouble which he had feared would be averted. In any case if it came at all it would not come for some considerable time. King Ghazi had accepted the wholesale dismissal of those about him with good enough grace, but, as I well knew, His Majesty was not to be counted upon not to gather them together again. Yasin was, therefore, busying himself about replacing them by people who would not be too uncongenial to their master. 32. The Prime Minister added that news had just reached him from Rome to the effect that the Italian Government were unwilling to co-operate in an effort to secure the annulment of the princess’s marriage and that he did not therefore wish to pursue the request he had made for the help of His Majesty’s Government in this matter. 33. Meanwhile, the Government have been busy with the drafting of amend ments to the Organic Law, the text of which will reach you in a separate despatch. These amendments contain a provision by which Princess Azzah may be deprived of her property in Iraq. Ministers admit that they are here on questionable ground, but they seem to be ready to face the consequences of any diplomatic difficulties in which this provision may involve the Iraqi Government.

( No - 282 ') Bagdad, June 10, 1936. ir ’ WITH reference to my despatch No. 273 of the 2nd June, I have the honour to report that during the last week the Iraqi army have been obliged to undertake further operations in the Diwaniyah liwa. . , , . 2 I enclose a copy of an official communique which was issued on tne evening of the 6 th June. From other sources I have obtained the lollowing additional information. During the last days of May, Sheikh Sha lan A1 Atiyah chief of the Shibanah section of the Akra’ Confederation, together with other neighbouring sheikhs, showed a disposition to follow the lead ot the Dhuwalim ancf the Bani Hucham. A tax collector was expelled by his tribesmen, police patrols were sniped in his tribal area, and the telephone line between Diwaniyah and Dagharah was repeatedly cut. Moreover, it was known that feheikh bha lan was busily collecting signatures for a round-robm demanding an immediate pardon for all the Bumaitha insurgents, the suspension ot conscription until work on a local canal had been finished, and an undertaking to respect religious customs. 3 On the 3rd June he was given an ultimatum to report to Diwamyah within twenty-four hours. This he ignored, and three hours after the expiry o± the ultimatum, an aerial demonstration was carried out over his tribal area. On the 5th June two columns comprising a total of six infantry batta ions, ox e cavalry regiment and two batteries of artillery began operations against the new insurgents. A force of about 100 tribesmen was dispersed as soon as the advanced guard deployed, but on the following day the troops met with more ^ esl ^ I J 5 : e h They were everywhere successful. By noon Dagharah was occupied and Sheikh Sha’lan’s fort destroyed. The official report states that hity H^smen w killed, but the Prime Minister estimates the total tribal casualties at about 3 ^ Amongst the killed were Sha’lan’s brother and his eldest son Another ^n was wounded and made prisoner. Several other important tribal also left dead on the battlefield. The army s losses were two other ranks killed ai d two officers and nine other ranks wounded. i-rv. u 4 The reasons for Sheikh ShaTan s revolt are at present difficult to appraise. It will be recalled that in March 1935 he was a prominent leader of the tribM movement against Ali Jaudat’s Government, which was inspire y ^ p who are now in office. I have not been able to discover exac y w ■ g 7 , he has against the party which he so heartily supported only a year ago, u ever the causes of his revolt, his stupidity m waiting until the Dh^alim had been crushed before raising his own tribes is almost unbelievable. I a PP e , . Government, it seems to be almost impossible for the tribes to concert their movements. Sha’lan is now said to be a fugitive m hiding wi le a on the north of the Hai. , ^ a t 5. This military success has naturally elated the Government, and 1 jound the Prime Minister calm and confident when I visited him a e mis ^ Foreign Affairs yesterday. The General Staff deserve credit P rom P^f s with which they collected their forces and the vigour with which they struck. There are still, however, causes for anxiety which the Governmen + ei h look. The disturbed area now extends from the Dagharah regulator o) S a c a distance of about 70 miles, through which run the railway and a coi irrigation system.

(c) The reason why Iraqi G-ovemment favour mission to Rome is that they think Italians must have been privy to marriage because inter alia the Italian Charge a Alfaires at Athens is alleged to have been present at the ceremony.

Story of the marriage of the Princess is now generally knov/n in Iraq, and within precisely twenty-four hours the Prime Minister and Nuri Pasha have both consulted me separately about the situation which it has created. Bach thinks that King G-hazi T s prestige has been so severely damaged that it may be difficult for him to survive the blow. Nuri Pasha goes so far as to say that the situa tion calls for the establishment of Regency Council. King Gtiazi, he tells me, has been brought into such contempt that the country may not be willing to suffer his rule any longer 0 Nuri Pasha has not yet taken las in Pasha into his con fidence, but his views have reached the prime Minister through a third person. Yasin Pasha while expressing the same views as Nuri Pasha about the King’s disgrace, is convinced that attempt to create Regency Council would expose Iraq uo the danger of a struggle for power between rival factions, moreover he right ly points out that there are no Iraqis to whom che Regency | could be safely entrusted. Both Yasin and Nuri have told me that if the Princess were speedily murdered in accordance with Arabic custom, King Ghazi's position would be saved. According to them some slight good might be done if the marriage could be dissolved and the Princess shut up as insane, but each one seems tobe inclined to reject this course as inadequate. I have done all I can to bring home to then the horror with which such a Murder would be received in the civilized world and have s I think, made some impression,, I have also supported Yasirks objeccions to hurt's Regency ideas, which might well, 1 think, expose the country to anarchy c At my suggestion hurt and Yasin are discussing the whole question with me privately at the Embassy tomorrow evening. 1 shall urge calm, a close check upon ring Ghazi s habits (which are deplorable), and upon movements ol the Royal family, and shall recommend that nothing drastic shall be done until the full effects of the affair become clearer.

WITH reference to my despatch N o. 23g _nf the 7th May last, I have the honour to inform you that an official communique was published in the press of the 12 th May in the following terms :— “ The leaders of the rebellion continue to make their submission to the G-overnment. Nothing has transpired to necessitate renewed military operations, activity being confined to minor action by the police and air force. The train service between Bagdad and Basra has been resumed. Investiga tions are proceeding to discover the causes underlying the subversive move ment so that preventive measures may be taken against future outbreaks.” Reports which have reached me from various quarters indicate that this communique is substantially correct and that the situation is well in hand. 2. During the operations in the Rumaitha district on the 7th-8th May, the army sustained a further thirty casualties and one ‘ ‘ Audax ' ’ aircraft was shot down by the tribesmen. Owing to the explosion of the bombs on board, the machine was totally wrecked. The pilot and mechanic perished. I gather that the aircraft was flying at an unduly low altitude at the time when it was struck. 3. On the 12th May a ££ Hawker-Nisr ” aircraft was hit by rifle fire and crashed in flames. The pilot and mechanic endeavoured to escape m their parachutes, but were killed by the tribesmen on landing. The body of the pilot was afterwards found to be riddled with bullets, while that of the mechanic had been horribly and deliberately mutilated. These disasters have caused a certain loss of moral in the Iraqi Air Force, whose incendiary bombs used hitherto with great effect against villages and crops, have been a deciding factor m the course 4. ^On the 8 th May, an outburst of sniping by a roving band of some 150 men caused the temporary withdrawal to Bagdad of the Iraqi aircraft stalione m Diwaniyah.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 192 of the 16th April concerning the prorogation of the Iraqi Parliament, I have the honour to submit the followino- report on the work accomplished by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies since the beginning of the present year. 2 . During January both Houses were chiefly occupied in discussing the budget for the year 19J5-36. As nine months of the year had already passed, the estimates were little more than stopgap figures, but the accompanying debates gave members and Ministers opportunities to discuss all aspects of the Govern ment’s policy. One or two Deputies twitted the Prime Minister for doing nothing to amend the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930, which, while out of office, he had so scathingly attacked, but Yassin Pasha defended himself vigorously, and his few critics made no impression on the Government’s majority. 3. After disposing of the budget for 1935 Parliament gave its attention to a large number of Bills dealing with many different branches of administration. A list of the more important laws passed, with a summary of their purport, is enclosed herein. The greater part of these have formed the subjects of separate despatches. 4. Towards the end of March the budget for 1936-37 came before Parliament, and during the first two weeks of April laws for the ratification of the Railway Agreement with the United Kingdom and the Treaty of Alliance with Saudi Arabia were passed. These measures have been fully reported on in separate despatches. 5. Two other Bills passed at the end of the session, though not of great administrative importance, were of special interest to His Majesty’s Government. One of these was the law enabling the British War Graves Agreement to be brought into force, and the other was a law amending the existing income-tax law. By the latter law, pensioners resident abroad are no longer liable to taxation on the pensions they receive from the Iraqi Government, and an attempt has been made to recast the section dealing with the assessment of non-resident traders so as to exempt them from taxation upon profits arising from trade with Iraq as distinct from trade in Iraq. I shall have the honour to address you on these two subjects when the texts of the two laws appear in the Official Gazette. ' 6 . The session as a whole was busy but not eventful. The Government maintained its solid majority and, except for one or two members who made a habit of criticism, it was seldom that a dissenting voice was heard. Two private members’ resolutions, however-one prohibiting Iraqis from marrying foreigners and the second abolishing family wakfs-gave rise to spirited debat^ which were followed with considerable public interest. Both resolutions ™ r e defeated^ but the debates showed that there is a steadily growing o y P P y n in favour of the extensive reform of social customs y c Persia such matters the influence of the progressive movemente in Tur^y and Be s^^ can clearly be seen, and the many recent newspaper articles ^ca g 1 g ^ tion to compel the general adoption of European dress no doubt derive Ue amTndtng a coprofthis despatch to His Majesty’s Charge d’Aiiaires at Tehran ' ° I have, &amp;c. , 4 (For the Ambassador), C.

I HAVE the honour to report a fresh outbreak of unrest on the Euphrates between Rumaitha and Samawa. 2 . After the disturbances in this area last year an army officer, Abdul Hamid- al-Shalchi, was appointed Mutessarif of Diwaniyah. His administration of the province was not, however, successful and it is now coming to light that he did not report fully to the Ministry of the Interior on the disturbed tribal situation which had been developing since the beginning of the current year. About the middle of the present month he was replaced by Khalil Azmi, formerly Mutessarif of the Diyala Province, who is a regular official with a sound record. 3. Khalil Azmi soon found that his predecessor had left him a legacy of dangerous discontent, and the situation became worse when, some days ago, the Euphrates in spate broke its banks in several places and flooded a large area of tribal land. Much loss was caused thereby which, many believed, could have been avoided if the Government had agreed to allow the surplus water to flow into the Habbaniyah Lake. 4. On the 21st and 22nd April it was reported that a train had been fired on near Rumaitha, but the train showed no bullet marks and the firing was probably not intended to be more than a demonstration. The men responsible belonged to the Dhuwalim, one of the tribes which had supported Sheikh Khawam- al-Abbas of the Bani Zurai] in his revolt last year. Their leaders were summoned to report to the Government headquarters,’ but refused to come in; and they presented a number of demands which included the restoration of Khawam s confiscated lands, exemption from conscription, and an undertaking that the Government would not enforce the wearing of Pahlavi hats. This last demand shows the confused ideas behind some of the tribesmen s grievances. 5. On the 28th April a lorry was held up just south of Rumaitha. A police patrol arrived while the looting was in progress and a skirmish with the tribesmen followed. The police suffered no casualties, but the incident indicated that the tribesmen were in a dangerous temper and, as a precautionary measure, rai way communication between Rumaitha and Samawa has been temporarily suspende l 6 . On the 29th April two flights of Iraqi aeroplanes (six machines) were sent to Diwaniyah and staff arrangements were made for the concentration o the following force with ancillary troops m the Diwamyah-Samawa area. 1 squadron of cavalry. 1 mountain battery. 7 infantry battalions. , 7. To-day the Minister of the Interior himself went by train to Eumaitha to investigate the sMon.^ ^ ig conflned to the Dhuwalim tribe, whose efforts to bring “ or from theSy any encouragement being given to the msurge m Citie 9.'

WITH reference to my despatch No. 225 of the 30th April, I have the honour to report the following further developments in the tribal situation in the Rumaitha area. 2. On the 1 st May, as the headmen of the Dhuwalim tribe persisted in their refusal to report to the Government headquarters at Rumaitha, tribal villages and concentrations of men between Rumaitha and Samawa were twice bombed by Iraqi aeroplanes. Incendiary bombs were used and several villages were destroyed. 3. On the same day the unrest spread to the north of Rumaitha, and the Bani Aridh and the Aajib tribes attacked a small police post at Aridhat. They also tore up a section of the railway line a few miles north of Rumaitha. 4. On the 2 nd May the police at Rumaitha, supported by a battalion of infantry, relieved the garrison of the Aridhat post. They claim to have inflicted heavy casualties on the tribesmen. At the same time aeroplanes bombed appropriate targets in the Aridh and Aajib tribal areas. 5. On the following day Amir Liwa Bakr Sidqi took over the duties of General Officer Commanding the troops in the area Diwaniyah-Basra, and established his headquarters at Diwaniyah. Two more battalions were ordered to the disturbed area. 6 . Bakr Sidqi’s plan is first to quell the disorders north of Rumaitha by moving one column from Diwaniyah southwards towards Rumaitha, and a second column from Rumaitha northwards towards Diwaniyah. This operation, it is expected, will be carried out to-day. _ .... 7. In the meanwhile, Iraqi aircraft have continued their bombing m the neighbourhood of Rumaitha. • 8 . The causes of the outbreak still remain obscure. Nothing further has yet come to light regarding the reasons for the revolt of the Dhuwalim, while the sudden rising of the Bani Aridh and the Aajib, after large reinforcements of troops had reached Rumaitha, remains without adequate explanation. 9. The Minister of the Interior is still at Rumaitha, and the Prime Minister has asked Mr. Edmonds to carry on the executive work of the Ministry until 10.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 230 of the 5th May last, I have the honour to inform you that the military operation carried out on the 5th May appears to have been completely successful. Two army columns, together with two flights of the Iraqi Air Force, dispersed a large gathering of tribesmen astride the railway 5 miles north of Rumaitha. The enemy were estimated to number about 1,200 armed men, including contingents from the Dhuwalim, the Bani Aridh and the “ Aajib,” and the army claim to have inflicted about 200 casualties. This is probably an over-estimate. The losses sustained by the Government forces were two officers and eight other ranks killed and forty wounded. 2. On the same day an Iradah was issued proclaiming martial law in the Rumaitha area. . . 3 . To-day’s official communique states that the principal tribal leaders have offered their submission, but I learn from a reliable source that none of importance has yet actually surrendered to the authorities. Railway communication has now been restored between Rumaitha and Diwaniyab, and two columns are to-day moving southwards from Rumaitha to Samawa. 4 The Bagdad press is unanimous in demanding the severest punishment of the rebels and those who incited them to take up arms against the Government. I gather that the Cabinet incline to the view that the present trouble is due to the clemency shown to the insurgent Euphrates tribes last year It is thereiore probable that the tribes now involved will be heavily punished.

This success was the result of the concerted operations undertaken by the Turkish and Iraqi frontier forces, which have been pressing Khalil and his band hotly since the beginning of the new year. 3. According to press reports four Turkish soldiers, who were wounded in the final engagement, have been brought into the Mosul hospital for treatment. They have been shown every kindness and have been visited officially by the mutessarif and the mayor. 4. The elimination of this dangerous band of brigands will, it may be hoped, enable the Government to undertake the much-needed measures for the pacifica tion of the distressed Barzan area. 5 .

Dear Chancery, Please see your confidential No.986/1-16/2 of 4th June last and our reply of 19th August. A foreigner, something of an expert in things Kurdish, nas recently spent six weeks in Sulemanieh and in t!he Dahijan district improving his knowledge of Kurdish dialects. We have had an opportunity of sounding him discreetly about this supposed pan-Iranian movement. He has seen absolutely no evidence of it. As regards the prospects of any such propaganda, supposing that it does exist, our informant was (piite definite that under present conditions it has no possibility of success. .Among the Kurds in Iraq, the Shah is the complete and perfect ogre. Our informant was seriously questioned as to the truth of a story that a mollah went from Meshed to protest to the Shah against the imposition of European hats, that he was paraded in the square in Tehran before the populace, where the Shah rammed a hat on his head, palled it down over his eyes and ears and then fixed it there with an iron spike which protruded beneath the man’s chin. The Iranis would find it very difficult to find anything which would counter-balance the effect of this crude, but vivid picture. As evidence of the pity which the Iraqis feel for the Iranis inform wit on. »nte S ..rir i» «■= 41 * trl °* .no ..Id that if tiiey war* encour.g.d by th. pro.!., of .

Among the Kurds of the Lahijan plain the conviction persists that Iraq, is a better country to live in than Iran. Some of them advanced to our informant the argument that all the land drained by the Lesser Zab ought to belong to Iraq and asked him whether he saw any prospect of Iraq taking possession. Our opinion therefore, if we may venture it, is that either Bagdad has discovered a mare’s nest, or that the bogy of Pan-Iranian, propaganda has been put up to cover a little propaganda among the Kurds in favour of Iraq. Finally, a little side-light; our informant stated that the Iranis are busy improving and widening the road from Baneh to Sardesht; he understood it was being done for military purposes.

In his despatch, (which was suhinitted at P.Z.5222/35) Sir Archibald Clark Kerr described the events which led up to the formation of Yas^im’s Government and the problems with which it was faced. So far the events have been favourable to yas^ia. The General election held this summer gave him a substantial Parliamentary majority, whilst ^ has succeeded in suppressing the revolts in the Middle Euphrates and in Sinjar. It was rumoured that the very extent of his success might tempt Tasiia to try to establish a dictatorship, but the Government has pledged itself to maintain the present constitutional form of Government so this rumour appears be unfounded. A/A certain amount of opposition is beginning, however, to show itself in the Chamber and these opposition forces are trying to exploit the rivalry of Yas^ia and Nuri Pasha. A breach in their present alliance would split the Cabinet irretrievably and would lead to a return of the factious political strife which reigned in Iraq after the removal of the strong Pua-d influence through the death of Faisal. It is certainly in the interests of H.M.G. to prevent this occurring and Sir Archibald Clark Kerr has therefore done his best to remove any misunderstandings which may exist between Yas^ia and Fuad. An account of his efforts at mediation is contained in a despatch which is now submitted. It would appear that the Government has a good chance of surviving and it is to be hoped that Yasgiza's protestations of good faith towards H.M.G. ik the Anglo- Iraq Treaty are sincere. 7 /&lt;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Iraq). CONFIDENTIAL. December 23, 1935. Section 1. [E 7470/278/93] Sir A. Clark Kerr to Sir Samuel Hoare.—{Received December 23.) (No. 645. Confidential.) Sir, Bagdad, December 6 , 1935. IT is now some four weeks since the Iraqi Parliament reassembled after the short extraordinary session that followed the general elections and the time has probably come to review the present position of Yassin Pasha’s Government and the situation in the country generally. 2 . So far the session has passed without incident, and there has been no sign of any concerted opposition inside the Chamber. Nevertheless, the Wihdah- al-Wataniyah, the party of which Nuri Pasha was at one time a leading member, has been stirring with new life. At the end of October it held its first general meeting under the chairmanship of Sheikh Ahmad Daud, a restless politician, who has more than once held office. Details of what passed at this meeting did not reach me, but it seems that a new executive committee was elected to oppose the Government in Parliament. At the same time leave was sought to found a newspaper to be edited by Jamil Baban, a Kurdish lawyer, who has from time to time served in Cabinets under Nuri and his friends. Meanwhile, Jamil Madfai was rallying the party in the Chamber and Senate and seeking, apparently with some success, for support amongst the officers in the army. He appeared also to be casting his net over Kurdistan and to be drawing in a good many notables. 3. This show of activity, coming as it did at a moment when there were persistent reports of differences within the Cabinet between Nuri and Tassin, gave colour to the belief that Nuri had only been biding his time to break with the Prime Minister and was now gathering his forces together for an attempt to supplant him. 4 . When, in the early spring, Yassin and Nun decided to put tire past aside and to throw in their lot together, it was the fashion to say that so unnatural a partnership must of necessity be short-lived. There were many who affirmed that Nuri’s loyalty to his chief could not outlast the rising on the Euphrates where the claims upon Nuri of old and deep-seated political mend- ships would be bound to bring about a clash. Nevertheless, from this ordeal the alliance seemed to emerge unshaken. It also survived some differences on points of policy and procedure during Nuri’s absences m Geneva and Tehran m the fate summer, and it has been strong enough to withstand t e susame e _ Jaafar Pasha, who is foolishly outspoken in his wish to wea “ ^ from his allegiance to Yassin. And thus, as time went on, there appeared to good ground for the hopes of those (and I was amongs from the nartv alliance the best, if not the only present chance o a11 y P,. • , .■£ j t } e strife and personal jealousies which had long tormented the political hie ol country and stood in the way of much-needed progressive ' £ ron| [ eave 5.

I asked him to tell me frankly what the facts were and what he felt about the position of his Cabinet and about the situation in general in the interior of the country. He began by saying that on the w hole he w^as by no means dissatisfied. The position of the Government was strong and well supported in a Parliament which could fairly be called representatives. When they had come into office they had found that the authority of Government in the provinces had fallen into contempt. (I need not say tnat he made no mention here of the share he had had in bringing about this unhappy state of things.) As I had seen, they had successfully re-established their prestige. In doing so they had had to be severe, but their severity had been softened by a wide amnesty and they were now doing their best to redress all genuine grievances. He could not say 'that they had made no mistakes. For instance, the recent executions in the Sin jar had probably been hasty and ill-considered, but he was taking steps to see that such things would not happen again. He hoped and thought that the country realised that the Government meant to assert their authority and that they would now be left in peace and quiet to carry out their programme of reforms. In order to be able effectively to do this the Government needed a long life and he did not know whether they could rely upon that. As I was well aware much depended upon whether he and Nuri continued to work together. Frankly, he was not sure whether he could still count upon Nuri. If I had heard that there was any palpable dissension between them that was an exaggeration. There had, indeed, been some slight differences on points of policy, but these had been disposed of and I need not fear that any move to get rid of Nuri would come from him, for without Nuri he clearly could not stand. So far as he knew Nuri had been loyal to him, but he felt that he was now drifting away from him and towards old associations and this was causing him anxiety. It would be a help to him if I would speak to Nuri in the same sense as I had spoken to him, and try to dismiss from Nuri's mind any impression he might have that the Prime Minister was in any way dissatisfied with his Minister for Foreign Affairs. 7. I said that it seemed to me that such things as this should rather be the subject of a frank and free talk between Nuri and himself, but I gathered from the nature of his reply, which was, I am bound to say, confused, that in Iraq it was difficult, if not impossible, for such relationships to be freely discussed between a Prime Minister and a member of his Cabinet, and in the circumstances I thought it best to undertake to speak to Nuri. Some days later an occasion offered itself for a private conversation which ranged over all the ground I had covered with Yassin. I found Nuri disposed to talk quite frankly. He said that he had the impression that Y assin believed that he (Nuri) wanted to be Prime Minister. That was quite wrong. He had had enough of being Prime Minister. He was content with the Ministry for Foreign ‘ Affairs, where he knew that he could do his best work. Y assin, on the other hand, was useless and even truculent in any subordinate post. He had to be at the head of the Government or in opposition, and in opposition he was damaging to the best interests of the country. Yassin believed that all men were like himself—eager to be at the top—and most of all he believed this of Nuri. There would be much o e gained if I could rid Yassin of this belief. At present Yassin was the only man m Iraq who was fit to be Prime Minister and I could tell him that Aun had given me his personal guarantee that he would be loyal to Yassin. As o e new ac ivities of the Wihdah-al- Wataniyah, Yassin need have no anxiety. ;; e (; i uri ) had ^hmg to do with them. It was true that Jamil Madfai had hwilf ?ri Che f i ln ! Wlth an offer of support and had asked him to put v • , a A , e . ead tins party, but he had replied that he was a member of S A dmiIlls ^ atl - and was g° in g to be loyal to it. Jamil Madfai had been much annoyed with him. Nuri went on to say that I must not assume from what he had told me ‘pi . •/ -*.*.*. ctooU-illC F1 UJ.11 W licit llt5 1 of count W. Far from it.

As for the Ministry of the Interior he was uncertain whether Rashid Ali was more to blame than the Prune Minister himself for what he described as ‘the present lack o± balance. He was inclined to think that more than half of the ‘olame lay with Yassin. In any case it was essential that the balance should be redressed, and he begged me to tell Yassin that, while the Prime Minister could count upon his loyalty, something would have to be done to keep the balance even He was referring to cases of land settlement, mainly on the Euphrates in which Rashid Ali had allowed his personal and political prejudices to twist the course of justice. Yassin was well aware of the failings of this Minister but was afraid of him. He had recently made a half-hearted attempt to persuade Rashid Ali to move from the Ministry of the Interior to that of Justice, but on meeting with resistance Yassin had decided to leave things as they were.’ This had been a mistake, for so long as Rashid Ali held his present post there would be no real peace in Iraq. 9. Nuri then reverted to the weakness of the palace and said that he was seeking a means to give it some strength. He had hopes in Rustam Haidar, the head of the King's diwan, but at present probably all that Rustam Haidar could do was to tip the scale in a doubtful situation. ' That was not enough. What was wanted was a show of strength and the exercise of direct influence upon the tribes. Rustam Haidar was probably the best man in Iraq to whom the King could go for advice, but he was handicapped because of the dislike and mistrust that the Prime Minister felt for him. If I could see my way to persuade Yassin to have confidence in Rustam Haidar, much good ground would be gained. 10. Nuri then spoke a little of the Prime Minister’s character and said that the general belief that Yassin was a strong man was a mistaken one. He was only strong when things were going well and when he felt that he could count upon support from all sides, more especially upon the support of the Embassy. He was at his best and most useful when he felt strong, and he must be kept strong, for his best was needed now. It would be of great value, therefore, if I could assure Yassin of my support. Nuri then contrasted his own character with that of Yassin. When things were not going well, he said, Yassin’s methods became tortuous (“he make zig-zag' were the words that Nuri used), while, as I must by now have come to perceive, he (Nuri), in good times and in bad, could be relied upon to keep on a straight line. I did my best to conceal my surprise. Nuri ended by saying that he must have made it clear to me that he was by no means happy, but he wished me to understand that he saw no combination that could be better for Iraq than the present one and that there was no question of his deserting Yassin until something better was in sight, and that would be unlikely for a long time to come. 11. Shortly after I was able to see the Prime Minister again and to pass on to him the appropriate parts of my conversation with Nuri. He was obvious y much relieved. He admitted that mistakes had been made by the Ministry oi the Interior and that probably Rashid Ali was not the best man oi e P os &gt; but it was, he said, difficult to make a change. Nun coulci however feel^ assured ■ that he would use his influence to keep the balance even. He shared ^un s regret that the palace did not play a more useful part in politics, and he said that, a from mistrusting Rustam Haidar, he believed him to be the es ac vis ^ could have. He then said that these conversations must th t insight into the weaknesses of Iraqi polities and that e °PO , , . i . Jlt ] iert0 I had learned would serve to diminish the support a desired to I replied that, as I conceived it, all that His Majfty _s_Go« see in Iraq was peace and stability and a faithful oit-ci \ a)i' j CO uld treaty.

The first few days were devoted to committee work and the Chamber did not meet until the 30th October, when a Bill was passed empowering the Government to issue regulations giving effect to article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. On the following day the extraordinary session, summoned after the general election of the summer, was prorogued. 3. On the 2nd November King Ghazi opened the ordinary session for 1935-36. 4. A translation of the Speech from the Throne taken from the Iraq Times of the 4th November is enclosed herein.^) In accordance with custom, the speech opened with a reference to foreign relations and expressed satisfaction at the progress made at Tehran and Geneva towards a settlement of outstanding diffi culties with Persia. This was followed by an appreciative mention of the negotiations for the final transfer to the Iraqi Government of the Iraq railway system and of the happy influence which this event had had on Anglo-Iraqi relations. His Majesty also spoke on the war in Abyssinia and the steps taken by his Government to carry out their obligations under article 16 of the Covenant. 5. Turning to home affairs, the King spoke of the successful suppression of banditry in the Barzan and Zibar areas, and congratulated his anny on the fitness which they had shown to maintain the rule of law and order. No direct reference was made to recent events in the Sin jar. 6 The speech concluded with a short catalogue of the more important Bills to be laid before Parliament during the session.

On the 18th October an official communique was published summarising briefly the causes of the disturbances and the punitive measures taken by the Government against the tribes concerned. It was also announced that all resistance having now been broken the military operations had been brought to an end. 3. The court-martial set up in the Sinjar by Royal Iradah on the 14th October continues, however, to try persons charged with participation in these disorders. I have been unable to obtain accurate statistics of the number of sentences passed, but a Mosul newspaper states that some ninety Yazidis have been sentenced to terms of imprisonment of not less than seven years each, while seven or eight village headmen have been hanged. The trial of a number of others, who were made prisoners during the operations, is proceeding. 4 . I am still making enquiries with a view to clear up the uncertainty which covers the facts of the arrests made in Mosul to which Mr. Bateman referred in his telegram No. 248 of the 17th October. Although, as I reported in my Saving telegram under reference, most of those arrested were released a few days later, subsequent news from Mosul, where the Christians appear to be alarmed, suggests that same have again been arrested on the flimsiest evidence and removed to the Sinjar for trial by court-martial.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 512 o f the 26th September, I’have the honour to inform you that, having received numerous indications from His Majesty’s acting consul at Mosul of the existence of unrest amongst the Yezidis in the Jebel Sinjar district, I made enquiries on this subject, both at the Ministry of the Interior and of the acting head of the military mission. 2 . It appears that sections of the Yezidis—^notably those in villages of Zairwan and Alidina—object to being conscripted on what purport to be religious grounds. It is suspected, however, that the real reason for their objection is not religious scruple but rather that the leaders fear that their influence will be undermined once the younger men come into contact with the outside world. That there may be some truth in this seems to emerge from the fact that the Agha Khudeidah informed the Mutessarif of Mosul that though there were religious grounds for justifying the refusal of his flock to join the Iraqi army, he would consider favourably a proposal to form a separate Yezidi unit. 3. In face of these obstructions, the Kaimakam of the Sinjar Qadha appealed, over the heads of the Yezidi leaders, direct to the rank and file. He gave orders that all Yezidis of military age should come in and signify their willingness to be conscripted. This seems to have been the signal for the inhabitants of the two villages mentioned above to sell up their belongings and take to the hills under Daud-al-Daud of Mahirkan, a notorious scallywag whose anti-Government activities led him into trouble in 1925, when he was detained in Nasiriyah. 4 . It should be noted that no opposition whatsoever has so far been experienced from the Yezidis on the east side of the Tigris, though it is said that Said Beg, the religious head of the sect, will shortly come to Bagdad and ask the Government to exempt all Yezidis from military service. . ^ TVip eitnatinn is not regarded as being 1 in the least serious, but the Erime them.

I HAVE the honour to inform you that the Minister of Education—Sheikh itiza-al-Shabibi—resigned on the morning of the 16th September and was replaced by Sadiq Beg A1 Bassam, the Director of State Domains and a staunch supporter of Yasin Pasha. 2. The event would be a matter of trifling importance were it not an indication that the Sunni-Shiah cleavage is causing no less trouble to the present Government than to its predecessors. For some years past the Ministry of Education has been a Shiah preserve and latterly has become the subject of much adverse criticism on the ground that each successive Minister has countenanced and condoned wire-pulling and indiscipline to such a point that the whole educational system in Iraq has become disreputable and chaotic. Apparently the outgoing Minister found himself obstructed at every turn by the intrigues of his co-religionists at Nejef and Kerbala and confessed inability to take arms against his sea of troubles. 3. When it became apparent that he was unable or unwilling to end them by opposition, the Prime Minister himself set his hand to the task of cleaning this Augean stable. He attempted to institute a system of dual control. A director of instruction was appointed to collaborate with Dr. Jamali, the present Director of Education—a young man of high ideals, who has carried on nobly in the face of much petty annoyance. The new official, however, was as impotent as his Minister and resigned twice in a fortnight. The Prime Minister then hit upon the expedient of appointing his brother, Taha Pasha, Chief of the General Staff, to restore order and discipline amongst the pedagogues. Taha Pasha has earned the admiration of all the members of the Military Mission (except General Hay) as a conscientious, industrious and intelligent soldier. The appointmen was probably a good one. It appears, however, to have been too much tor Kiza-a Shabibi, who forthwith retired from the unequal combat. Tradition is still followed in that his successor, of whom little is known, is also a ^hia • 4. The appointment of Taha Pasha to a post under the 1 mis ry o Education may, however, have another significance. For him e uca ion ls 01 W, part-time job.

These indications of trouble beneath the surface need not be too seriously regarded They are by no means the only ones, and I have no reason to believe that Yasin Pasha’s position is in any way endangered by them. Indeed, the struggle for the control of personnel in the employ of the various Government Departments may be nothing more than an effort to monopolise the much-coveted oraft which is said to accompany all new appointments in the army and elsewhere 7 .

BATEMAN.^HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF ]HIS BRlTAy^IC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT WITH reference to my despatch No. 475 of the 5 th September, I have the honour to inform you that Khalil Khoshawi has escaped into Persian territory with his remaining twenty followers. His family has been captured, and, in all, some sixty-three of his followers have been tried by court-martial. Up to the present, eight have been condemned to death and hanged. The remainder have been sentenced to various terms of imprisonment and have been sent to the dreary wastes of Southern Iraq. 2 . In conversation recently, Yasin Pasha told me that the policy of evacuating the villages in the vicinity of Khalil’s operation had turned out to be a complete success. It had deprived him of much-needed information and supplies, and as a result he was almost hemmed in by the Iraqi and Turkish units working together when his discretion got the better of his valour and he hopped over into Persia. His Excellency added that the co-operation of the Iraqi and Turkish forces had left little to be desired. 3. Apparently the summary justice meted out under military law has made a deep impression^ in the affected district and the Prime Minister has given instructions that no more death sentences are to be carried out except by his permission. 4. Another indication of the relative strength of his position is shown by the fact that the recent trouble at Qurna (see my Savingrams Nos. 22 and 23 of the 29th August and the 4th September) has finally petered out. A fine of 500 rifles has been collected and steps are now being taken to collect the money fines. 5.

Mr. Bateman to Sir Samuel Hoare. — (Received, September 23.) &gt;ir, WITH reference to my despatch No. 137 oAK^ust A't, 'l have the honour to inform you that Parliament was prorogued by a Royal Iradah of the 9th September for forty-five days with effect from the 10th September. Should no further Iradah be issued on or before the 26th October next, it is probable that the extraordinary session will be continued for a period of six days immediately betore the next ordinary session opens on the 2nd November next’. 2. Despite the intense heat of August and early September, the extra ordinary session has been one of no little activity in both Houses. Of thirty-four Bills passed through the Chamber of Deputies, the greater number were designed to authorise expenditure on capital works (including the railways and the Port of Basra) and to make provision for financing the public services in the absence of the regular budget, which, presumably, will be passed during the autumn session. 3. But Parliament did not confine itself to routine matters. On the 13th August, an important amendment was introduced into the Customs Tariff Law by a law which formed the subject of my despatch No. 447 E. of the 19th August. 4. By an enactment of the 31st August, the Ministry of Finance was empowered to set up a much-needed board to advise on the date industry with a view to improve upon the present methods of cultivation and marketing. The board is to consist of ten members, of whom three may be foreigners. 5. On the 5th September, the Chamber of Deputies sanctioned arrangements, similar to those outlined in my letter of the 7th August to Mr. Rendel, whereby the Ministry of Finance may raise funds up to a total of I.D. 400,000 for municipal improvements. Half of the total will be devoted to Bagdad and the remainder will be spread over other towns and villages at the instance of the Ministry of Interior. The law provides that the money is to be repaid within tv/enty years at 4-| per cent, per annum, and I understand that immediate accommodation will be found by an advance from the Eastern Bank up to a total of I.D. 200,000. The Iraqi Treasury will recoup itself from the proceeds of the tax on motor spirit. 6. On the political side, the most important acts of Parliament concerned the Euphrates troubles of last spring. Laws were passed ratifying the proclamation of martial law and absolving, from civil responsibility, those military and other authorities who were called upon to act in accordance therewith. 7. On the 7th September, the general amnesty law envisaged in the King’s speech of the 8th August was passed and was put into effect on the 8th September —the accession day of King Ghazi. It pardoned all those who rose against the Government in the Liwas of Diwaniyah, Diyala and Nuntafiq between the 15th December, 1934, and the 2nd June, 1935, and in the Liwas of Kirkuk and Sulaimani between the 1st March, 1923, and the 15th August, 1^35. It included those who, only a few days ago, were still on trial for their share in the Kadhimam riots of last March. Its wide scope, which came as a surprise even to the most optimistic, indicates that it was intended to be a measure of general appeasemen and that wise counsel is now prevailing in responsible quarters. It was no passed, however, without a good deal of heated rhetoric and recrimination m both Houses. In the Senate, where a violent controversy occurred between e Prime Minister and Jamal-al-Madfai, accusation and counter-accusation followed in rapid succession and culminated in the resignation of the rime mis er s opponent, who had only been exalted to senatorial rank a few weeks earlier. He was eventually persuaded to withdraw his resignation. In e ower ous , efforts of the Minister of Interior to pursue his personal animosities [506 z—3] wereresolutely met and it can, I think, safely be said that the Amnesty Law has not only cleared the air, but has also enhanced the reputation of the Iraqi Throne Whether it was altogether prudent to give so soon a free pardon to men who only a few months ago, were under sentence of death, remains to be seen, but there can be no question that, at the moment, the general feeling is one of 8. lam sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran I have, &amp;c.

We have no information about any attempts to develop a pan-Iranian movement among the Kurds, but we had garnered in bauj Bulak some hints which may be helpful as to the attitude of the Kurds in general. We were told that the Kurds on this side of the border are thoroughly discontented, the grounds for their disaffection being the military service obligation here, the difficulty in making a living what with depressed prices for produce and trade restrictions which have driven so many to smuggling, and the exactions of the tax- collectors who ( uarter themselves in the best houses and make free of its resources until the owner adds to the official tax a sufficient bounty to induce them to move on. As a result many Kurds have gone over into Iraq and the feeling is said to be general that Iraq is a much better place for a Kurd to live in than Iran. The adoption of general military service in ^raq, however, has latterly damped this enthusiasm somewhat, but the discontent with conditions in Iran remains as strong as ever, and there is no indication that Kurds in Iraq who have had experience of conditions here would be w iling to absorb Iranian propaganda. We cannot, of course, answer for those Kurds who have been long resident in Iraq and who are now facing military service for the first/ s Chancery, British Legation, Tehran* IW) Tabrig, 19 th August, 1936.first time; tut our impression is that among the Surds as a whole the balance of feeling i B ln favour of Irac and we are not surprised to read that the pan-Iranian propaganda has so far met with little success.

A pious hope was also expressed for the success of the direct negotiations now taking place in Tehran for the settlement of the frontier dispute between Iraq and Iran. 3. In dealing with the question of national defence, His Majesty referred to the satisfaction with which the Iraqi people had received the announcement concerning the application of the new conscription law. This can hardly be taken at its face value, since it is a matter of common knowledge that the demonstrations which took place in Bagdad and Basra in favour of the law were by no means spontaneous or popular, but were deliberately staged and paid for by certain mukhtars, who were anxious to get kudos from the new Government for the enthusiasm ’ ’ which they had managed to instil into the youth of their districts. 4. For the rest, the speech merely epitomises the programme of the Govern ment which was reported in Sir Archibald Clark Kerr’s despatch No. 395 of the 11th July last. 5. At the meeting of the Chamber which followed the formal opening, the present Minister of Justice—Muhammad Zaki Beg, a staunch supporter of the Prime Minister—was elected to the presidency of the Chamber by an over whelming majority. Two vice-presidents, also friends of Yasin Pasha, were appointed. It is thought, in some quarters, that Muhammad Zaki’s new appoint ment will make it possible for Hikmat Beg Sulaiman to enter the Government as Minister of Justice. 6. It is anticipated that this session of Parliament will be very short, and that it will not be possible for the budget to be considered until the autumn session. 7.

[E 5422/432/93] Mr. Bateman to Sir Samuel 11 oare.—{Received September 9.) (No. 453 E.) Sir, THERE . Bagdad, August 2*2, 1 §§q. are several indications that the economic policy of the Iraqi Government has become more clearly defined during the summer months 2. In my telegram No^ 2 03 of_the 12th August, I had the honour to inform you that the Government were seriously considering the floating of a loan of £1,500,000 in the United Kingdom, for the purpose of purchasing and extending the existing railway system. This, in itself, is most significant in that it shows that the progressive members of the Cabinet have succeeded in persuading their more conservative colleagues to abandon the parish pump and to look beyond the walls of Bagdad. 3. For the past three years at least opinion has been divided as to the means of financing the capital works and development schemes of which the country stands so much in need if it is to be rescued from the poverty that threatened to overwhelm it before oil came to its rescue. On the one hand, there were those who held that it was essential to their newly-won independence to wipe out all foreign indebtedness so far as possible, and to start and continue the new life of freedom with a clean slate. Their view was not so much that loan oft loses both itself and friend—a reflection which would probably have left them quite cold—but rather that it placed the debtor under an undue and intolerable obliga tion to the lender, who was apt to exploit his advantage. These were the people who may be held responsible for paying off the residue of the Ottoman Debt and for pursuing the conservative financial policy inculcated by the British advisers. To them belongs some of the kudos for balanced budgets, the accumulated surplus from the oil royalties and dead rent, and the fact that Iraq emerged scatheless from the financial blizzard of 1930-33. 4. It is, of course, possible and even probable that their heads were turned by the sudden accretion of wealth which the Iraq Petroleum Company—and to a minor and more doubtful extent the British Oil Development Company - brought them. They felt secure in advocating that development schemes could well be made to wait until there were funds, either actually in the bank or in sight, sufficient to enable their execution to be carried out in slow time. They were all for financing the capital works programme out of revenue, forgetful of the fact that economic conditions, like peace in the modern world, are not static but dynamic. So far they had won the day, with the result that the only major scheme of any importance yet attempted has been the Kut barrage. 5. On the other hand, there was always a minority who were anxious to speed up the tempo, to raise the standard of living and to increase the pro oc I've capacity of the country. These people sometimes had the temerity o sugges ia the oil royalties could most advantageously be used as security or a eve 0 P m ® loan contracted abroad. But until recently they remained no mg more a ■- minority whose voice was seldom heard. 6. It was, therefore, with no little surprise that I learned from the Prime Minister last week that he had come round to their view. i e counted amongst those who mistrusted the would-be foreign &gt; ■ . still somewhat at a loss to account for his sudden conversion. Several considera tions may hTve contributed to it, but in all probability he fy 8 . ^ fleas'ng large part of the current revenue must be disorders of last spring the strength of the army and air force.

I gathered from a recent conversation with Yasin Pasha that this ^ . 1 * j 1 U rx&gt;r\ Kn 4- 4* Pi o 4* 4-P-»/-\ l' . scheme was at present only in the embryonic stage, but that the Government were of opinion that the time bad come for Iraq to have a central bank of its own, similar to those established in other countries since the war and continuously advocated by the financial experts of the League of Nations. The bank would take over the note issue, and this would, of course, mean that the present currency board in London would eventually cease to exist. The Prime Minister expressed the hope that, when the time came, the three British banks operating in Iraq and some of the joint stock banks in London, would be found ready to collaborate in furnishing the necessary capital. He assured me that it was not the intention of the Iraqi Government to curtail in any way the activities of the British banks in Iraq but rather to enlist their active co-operation in developing more rapidly than at present the resources of the country. 9. In my despatch No. 447 E. of the 19th August last, I had the honour tc inform you of an amendment recently introduced into the Customs Tariff Law of 1933. This amendment is designed to enable the Government to take active measures to redress the balance of trade with those countries, such as Japan, where hitherto it has been on the wrong side. If and when the Government take action under the new law, British firms should be ready to seize the opportunity offered tc regain those markets in which they were formerly supreme, but into which Japan has made inroads during the past few years. 10. The three developments mentioned above seem to offer an encouraging prospect for increased British enterprise in Iraq, and I trust that British interests will not be slow to avail themselves of the opportunities when they occur. 11.

[E 5008/278/93] Mr. Bateman to Sir Samuel Hoare.—(Received August 19.) (No. 430.) Sir, Bagdad, August 7, 1935. WITH reference to Sir A. Clark Kerr’s despatch No. 341 of the 19th June last, I have the honour to inform you that the general elections came to an end on the 3rd August with the polling of the secondary electors’ votes. The results were published the same day, and show that there has been an increase of twenty in the total number of seats in the Majlis, 108 Deputies having been elected as compared with eighty-eight in former Parliaments. The press finds the reason for this in the augmented number of primary electors disclosed by the recent census, and, I am told, by those in daily touch with the situation, that a genuine effort has, in fact, been made to make this Parliament more broadly representative / than its predecessors. Mr. Edmonds was shown the list of candidates for the/ northern liwas and was satisfied that, except in one instance, it could hardly have! been improved upon. To this extent, therefore, the lessons of the recent upheaval/ appear to have been learned. 1 2. With few exceptions, the vernacular organs of the press jubilantly moralise on the Government’s tolerance in allowing these elections to be free from undue influence, and justify their arguments by pointing to the complete tranquillity in which they were carried out. My own impression is that this unruffled calm may be traced to the apathy induced by the extreme summer heat of Bagdad. Several of the newly-elected members have, however, assured me that they were not pressed at these elections to pledge their allegiance in writing to any given leader or party. 3. An analysis of the results shows that sixty-eight of those now elected have had previous parliamentary experience, while some forty are new-comers. Amongst these latter is Rauf Beg Bahrani, the Minister of Finance. The Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice—Muhammad Zaki—were returned unopposed, and Amin Zaki, the Minister of Economics and Communications, was re-elected. The remainder of the Cabinet are Senators. 4. Amongst the prominent former Deputies who disappear from the scene are Hikmat Sulaiman, Arshad-al-Umari, Ali Jaudat and Jalal Baban The firs mentioned will be remembered as one of the instigators of the revolt m the sprn g of Abdul Wahid, who himself now reappears as one of the Deputies tor Diwaniyah. It was generally thought that Hikmat Sulaiman would be found a place as President of the new Chamber, but he is said to be disgruntled and Id not know whether he consented to stand for election.

During the elections there were signs that some of Yasin’s supporters who anticipated relegation to the wilderness, were ready to remind him of his former opposition to the treaty of 1930. Their tilts at him, however, seem to have been in the nature of Parthian arrows, and there is nothing at present to show that Yasin Pasha’s position is in any way endangered. 8.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 358 of the 24th June last, I have the honour to report that, in pursuance of their policy of improving the administra tion of the country, the Government have now issued new regulations for the organisation of the Ministry of Economics and Communications. 2. I enclose herein a plan showing the different departments of the Ministry as it will be constituted in future. The chief effect of the new regulations is to restore to independent existence the Departments of Irrigation, Public Works and Surveys. These were amalgamated by Arshad Beg A1 Umari, who was Minister for Economics and Communications in Ali Jaudat Beg's last Cabinet, but the scheme has proved unsatisfactory and the return to the old organisation will, I think, be generally welcomed. The separation of the Agricultural and Veterinary Departments is also a reversion to a previous arrangement and marks the special interest which the present Government are taking in improving and increasing the live-stock of the country. A sheep-dipping campaign is one of the Prime Minister’s projects in this sphere. 3. The Department of Industrial Research is an innovation. The regulations stipulate that the most important function of this department is to carry out research work into the best means of exploiting the mineral resources of the country, and to study the ways and means of developing national industries of all kinds.

The remaining items comprise an ambitious and comprehensive plan of economic and social legislation which it is most unlikely that the Government will be able to carry out in full The intention, however, seems to be sound and, as many of the proposed reforms have already been studied by previous Cabinets, there is a fair prospect that, if Yasin Pasha’s Government can remain in office for two or three years, much useful work will be done. 3.

THE Iraq Cabinet’s statement of policy, which has been eagerly awaited by the public, was issued yesterday evening. The programme announced will provide the basis on which the forthcoming elections will be fought. The statement is prefaced by a short resume of the situation at the time the Cabinet took office, which accounted for the delay in the announcement of its programme. The difficulties then encountered having been satisfactorily disposed of, the Government is now in a position to make its declaration of policy. The aims of the Government are :— 1. The maintenance of the Constitution and the defence of the present form of government against any forces which may tend to change this system. 2. To amend the Electoral Law in order to make the Majlis more represen tative of the various classes of the people. . „ 3. To foster a spirit of brotherhood among the people and combat with all the forces at the Government’s command subversive feeling or movements li ^e y to stir up dissension. , 4. To safeguard public morality and eliminate any factors having a detrimental influence thereon ; to encourage sports and sports ms i u ions, an to support them both morally and financially. . ^ r • i 5. To amend the articles of the Officials Disciplinary Law m a manne will enable the Government to dispense with the services of mcompe e , 6. To develop the feeling of responsibility among officials and make he heads of Departments directly responsible to their respec ive fulfilment of the regulations. [456 y—4]2 7. To ensure co-operation between the Government and the people in tht S construction of model dwelling-houses throughout the country. 8. To improve labour conditions and institute the necessary legislation for this purpose. 9. To take measures for the settlement of the tribes and to ameliorate their conditions of life by removing all causes of distress and dissatisfaction, and by instituting a higher standard of health and education among them. J 10. To improve municipal conditions and facilities, and to provide financial assistance for the construction of houses for the poorer classes at low annual rentals. . , . 11. To drain the marshes throughout the country m the interests of public health, and to take measures against the spread of diseases in accordance with medical plans which have been drawn up with this object. 12. To increase the army strength to a point sufficient to ensure the defence of the country against aggression; to increase the air force and encourage societies formed for this purpose; to open factories for supplying the army with its requirements, and, in general, to develop the resources of the country. 13. To prepare measures for the establishment of an Agricultural Bank, a National Bank and a Mortgage Bank; to inaugurate the savings bank move ment and the employers’ liability system; to stimulate the export of goods and produce; and to reduce the taxes on lands and live-stock. 14. To ensure governmental control over certain industries which are essential to the development of the country, such as the construction of an oil refinery and the effecting of improvements in the date industry, either by Govern ment borrowing, or by the formation of companies in which the Government will have an interest as shareholders; and finally, to improve transport conditions. 15. To take steps to develop the mineral resources of the country; to construct roads, bridges and irrigation canals. 16. To improve the quality of seeds and live-stock, and to take measures to eradicate diseases and insects affecting agricultural produce. 17.

In the absence of Minister of Defence and Chief of General It was reported yesterday that in face of prompt measures taken by the brine Minister tribal chiefs had surrendered. Matter is not regarded as serious but has been hushed up. It is a further indication that Prime Minister now feels firm in the saddle and will not tolerate any obstruction from a company of infantry, and 4 guns from Basra. tribes.

The withdrawal of troops from the Muntafiq area began during the first week of July. Two battalions and one battery still remain at Suq-al-Shuyukh; and one battalion is at Diwaniyah, but the protection of Nasiriyah has been taken over by the police.

IN my despatches Nos. 358 of the 24th June and 390 of the 5th July, I had the honour to bring to your notice a number of measures elaborated by the Iraqi Government in order to improve the organisation of certain departments, including the Ministry of the Interior. New instructions have now been issued governing the work of the administrative inspectorate. These provide for the division of the provinces into five groups, each group being placed under a board of inspection consisting of two administrative and one finance inspector. 2. The five provincial groups will be— (1) The liwas of Mosul and Arbil. (2) The liwas of Kirkuk, Sulaimani and Diyala. (3) The liwas of Bagdad, Kut and Dulaim. (4) The liwas of Karbala, Hillah and the Southern Desert area. (5) The liwas of Basra, Amarah and the Muntafiq. The instructions give full powers to the inspectors to enquire into and report on every branch of administrative work, including that of the municipalities. 3. There is at the moment only one British administrative inspector. His headquarters have hitherto been in Kirkuk and his responsibilities have been limited to the two liwas of Sulaimani and Kirkuk. I gather that on his return from leave he will be retained on the inspectorate board of the second group of liwas. Later on, it is intended to appoint another British administrative inspector to group (1). One of the officers now working in the Land Settlement Department (all of whom have had previous experience of provincial administration) will probably be chosen for this post. „ , , . , ^ £ 4. The Administrative Inspectorate Law of 1933 fixed the headquarters of all administrative inspectors in Bagdad, but it has been found that this has not given satisfactory results. Inspectors have seldom visited their liwas and their inspections have produced colourless reports, showing no real understanding of the local situation. This defect has been realised by the Government and under the new scheme it is hoped to bring about a c osei an P i supervision of the provincial administration. I he Governmen ^ hoards the law of 1933 by establishing the headquarters of the five inspectorate boa at Mosul, Kirkuk, Bagdad, Diwaniyah and Basra. 1 ^ ARCHIBALD CLARK KERR.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 316 of the 11th June, I have the honour to report that during the past week the~work of pacifying the district of Suq-al-Shuyukh has proceeded smoothly. Farhud-al-Eandi and two other chieftains of the Hachcham tribe have left the neighbourhood, and since their departure no further opposition has been offered to the Government troops. A collective fine of 200 rifles has been imposed upon the tribe and several section leaders are being held as hostages until this fine is paid. Eleven chieftains of the Bani Khaiqan, who also took part in the revolt, are to be tried by court-martial. Six Lewis guns and 196 rifles taken from the police in Suq-al-Shuyukh have been recovered from the tribes. 2. In Nasiriyah the situation is quiet. Rifle fines are being collected from the tribes, and the Military Court continues to try those charged with offences against law and order. Six townsmen have been sentenced to five years’ imprison ment, two mullahs have been given life sentences, and a number of bigger schoolboys have been flogged for breaches of the peace. 3. On the Gharraf (Hai) the disturbed situation has led to an outbreak of agrarian disorders. A land dispute between sections of the Bani Said tribe resulted in a sharp skirmish about the 10th June, in which some twenty men were killed and three wounded. The Kaimakam of Shatrah tried unsuccessfully, with the help of tribal intermediaries, to establish a truce, and, as the rival leaders ignored an order to report to the authorities, they were bombed on the 15th June. 4. Further south the Albu Alyan section of the Abudah tribe have attacked and driven out the cultivators of an unpopular non-tribal landlord. Fighting has been stopped by the police and the kaimakam has summoned the pi incipals to his headquarters in order to settle the dispute. 5. These disorders have their chief cause in land quarrels and are not directly connected with the political issues which gave rise to the lecent insurgent movements in Nasiriyah and Suq-al-Shuyukh. It is, never ^e ess, significant that the unpopular landlord, whose men have been evicted by the Abudah, is a staunch supporter of the present Prime Minister. 6. I am informed by the Prime Minister that the death sentence passed on Sheikh Khawwam-al-Abbas, the leader of the revolt m Rumaitha, has been commuted to one of imprisonment for life. Mi rhetor at 7.

In the Suq-al-Shuyukh district new police posts have been established at strategic points, and the provincial authorities are gradually recovering control over the marsh areas. Up to the 22nd June, 206 rifles and 8 Lewis guns, which had been captured from the police, had been recovered.

The full texts of the regulations will be forwarded to you when they are published in the English edition of the Official The changes which have been made in the Ministry of the Interior are intended to be a first step towards the improvement of the Administration of the country, of whose defects so much has recently been heard. 3. The Directorate-General of Municipalities has been revived and will. I understand, be chaiged with the primary duty of ensuring a good supply of drinking-water to every town in the country.' A new Department of Tribal Affairs bus been created, which wdll be entrusted with the administration of the Tribal Civil and Criminal Disputes Regulation, with the preparation of schemes for the gradual settlement on the land of nomadic tribes and with the adminis trative settlement of tribal disputes concerning land and water rights. 4. The Department of Propaganda and Publicity is also a new creation. Its duties will be to administer the Press Law, to control foreign publications entering Iraq and to arrange for the dissemination abroad of suitable information concerning the economic and political life of the country. 5. The new regulations for the Ministry of Finance raise the status of the State Properties and Trade sections to that of departments under a Director- General, but otherwise make no noteworthy change. 6.

Section 5. [E 3888/1583/93] Sir A . Clark Kerr to Sir Samuel Hoare.—(Received June 24.) (No. 316.) SiL Bagdad, June 11, 1935. WITH reference to my despatch No. 295 of the 29th May, I have the honour to report that the reoccupation of Suq-al-Shuyukh was completed without opposition on the 2nd June. Since then the troops and police have been engaged in the pacification of the surrounding country, but their movements have been seriously hampered by the high floods of the Euphrates, and tribal resistance has not yet been completely broken. Fines of 50-100 rifles have been imposed on the tribes chiefly responsible for threatening a breach of the peace at Nasiriyah, and punitive measures are still being carried out against the Bani Hachcham for their sacking of Suq-al-Shuyukh. 2. On the 9th June a small column of about one company encountered determined opposition, and lost one man killed and fourteen wounded. Heavier casualties are believed to have been inflicted on the tribal forces. A larger column, supported by machine guns in boats, is to be sent to punish the sheikh responsible for this opposition. His name is Farhud-al-Fandi, and hitherto he has been a conspicuous supporter of the Government and of the local authorities. 3. Three officials of the Suq-al-Shuyukh district have been tried by court- martial and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for inciting the tribesmen to revolt, and four others are awaiting trial. Two ex-soldiers, convicted of using machine guns against the police, were sentenced to death and hanged on the 6th June. 4. I learn privately that Bakr Sidqi Pasha, the Officer Commanding the Forces on the Euphrates and also administering martial law, is pressing the Government to agree to execute a number of sheikhs and to inflict heavy punish ments on the tribes guilty of taking up arms against the Government. The Cabinet do not, however, see eye to eye with him : firstly, because they consider his recommendations unnecessarily harsh and vindictive; and, secondly, because Abdul Wahid is exerting his influence to secure a general amnesty for those sentenced by the military courts. He is said to have declared his determination to revolt himself if Sheikh Khawwam-al-Abbas were executed. 5. In my talks with the King and with Yasin Pasha, I have, on several occasions, indicated that clemency towards those implicated in the recent disturbances would be wise, and would in the long run prove a better factor m restoring order and stability than severity. . . 6.

WITH reference to my despatch No. JLZ4 Df the 28th March I have the honour to inform you that most of the Kurdish aghas had left Bagdad by the middle of April. ° J 2. Apparently they did not succeed in obtaining any definite undertakings from the Lrovernment concerning the requests which they had put forward on behalf of the Kurds, though soothing assurances in general terms seem to have been given to them by both the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Interior. 3. On returning to their homes, further local discussions and meetings took place among the interested aghas. The reports of the deputation to Bagdad were considered, and it was generally felt that, although these were somewhat intangible, the best course would be to wait and see what effect was given to the oral assurances which had been received from the leading members of the Cabinet. In regard, however, to the question of the nomination of official candidates for the next general election, it was decided that further representa tions should be made at once. For this purpose a deputation of aghas of the Dauda, Jaf, Dizdai and Talabani tribes came to Bagdad in the first week in May. 4. They were cordially received by the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Interior, to whom they explained the common desire of the Kurds that in the next Chamber they should be represented by local personalities of note, and that outsiders from Bagdad should not be foisted on the Kurdish constituencies. They submitted for the Government’s consideration a list of suitable candidates from amongst whom they suggested the Government should choose their nominees. The Ministers promised sympathetically to bear in mind the representations of the aghas, and dismissed them reasonably contented with the results of their visit. While in Bagdad they frequently gathered in Sheikh Mahmud’s house. He has told my oriental secretary that he advised them strongly not to think of any form of tribal activity against the Government. 5. From several sources I have received information that, in addition to their intrigues among the Shiahs, to which I have several times referred in my despatches on the Euphrates troubles, the Persian Government are working for a pan-Iranian movement among the Kurds. So far their propaganda has made very little progress, but, if serious discontent were to develop among the Kurds of Iraq, the pan-Iranian ideal, if cleverly propagated, might easily win a large measure of support. . 6.

Parliament was adjourned on the 9th April and, under the terms of article 40 of the Organic Law, it must reassemble in extraordinary session within four months from that date. There remain, therefore, only two months in which to carry out the elections. 3. The Government are not certain whether, in present circumstances, this can be done and are somewhat anxious lest the elections should give rise to new disorders. They have consulted Mr. Drower (one of the framers of the Organic Law), but I gather that he has been unable to suggest any way of avoiding the provisions of article 40. 4.

This apparently took the form of high Government officials promising the Hatcham tribesmen in occupation of the town, a general amnesty and complete forgiveness, if they would evacuate the town, retire to their houses and once again return to the cultivation of their lands. It is said that the promise was given in writing and that the rebels accepted the conditions, but that as soon as they evacuated the town and the government forces arrived and took possession, the latter proceeded to fortify the mace and _using it as a base, started relentless war operation against those to whom they had rremised amnesty . CCfnhmf, The above storg is mentioned for what it is 'north, but it might be worthwhile for the IKAh Government bo deny this story of tre,chery before the report gets too videly diffused in the Desert. ^In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. ny person by name, but to^— »|VflP£NHAk s- \/ no ^nd address —not to any person by name, Imt to^- &gt;..v .y “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1 . / ^ 1 J1AG THE Under-Secretary of State: for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to ^ &lt;7 ‘ .x r - ex. and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop-&lt;^ of the under-mentioned paper.

Clark Kerr to Sir John Simon.—{Received June 17.) (No. 300. Confidential.) Bagdad, May 30, 1935. BY means of a series of telegrams and despatches from this Embassy during the past four months or so you have been kept currently informed both of the circumstances which led to the accession to power of the present Iraqi Govern ment under Yasin Pasha A1 Hashimi and of the events which have occurred since they took office some nine weeks ago. 2. The time has probably now come to reassemble in a further despatch the factors which contributed to bring this Cabinet into being, to draw in some background to the picture, and to attempt some appreciation of the situation with which Iraq is now faced. 3. For present purposes it may be convenient to go back to the beginning of the year, when Yasin Pasha, Rashid Ali Beg and Hikmat Suleiman Beg set on foot their movement to overthrow the Ali Jaudat Government. As I see it, the situation was then dominated by two relatively new and essential factors. The influence of the palace had disappeared, and the tribes had made their first excursion into politics. Since the death of King Feisal, nearly two years ago the whole policy of this country had suffered a radical change. By the force of his personal prestige, which he had used with skill and, it must be admitted, without scruple, King Feisal had been able to keep a check upon the powerful riverain tribes which form so large and important an element m the population of Iraq By playing the one off against the other, he had curbed their lawless- ness kept them at peace, and held them aloof from the political intrigues of the capital. His influence had, indeed, been paramount everywhere The suddenness of its withdrawal upset the balance. There was nothing to take its place, ihe palace slid into the background, whence it is unlikely to emerges Politicians m Bagdad were at a loose end. The tribes not only reverted to the feuds that had troubled their relations in the past they entered politics ato; some under the aegis of Ali Jaudat and the Wihdah party, and others un ff.A p ° 3th bared the Ikha-al-Watani. The two groups faced each other as it were with b teeth. wag a fairly s i m pl e one. The Government were weak and iresolute At their head was aYan both commonplace and corrupt; and too fodSY ^‘heedless to see that the country -^ng ~ off civil war. The incompetence and peculation of the Admnmtration naa o^o g^ government into contempt, and had exacerbated pub P 8 sheikhs country. Nearly everyone had a grievance to nurse The and of the south and the aghas of the north was smM mg und gOTemme nt often discourteous treatment they received from the insttumenrs c S in the provinces.

[431 r—2]right their wrongs. By such means as these the Bagdad cabal, working the control of Yasin Pasha, set in motion, for the first time in the hi t Under Iraq, what must be called a strong and representative popular movement 8 • °i the Government in power. a ^ ainst 6. The measure of the success which was achieved has been de K elsewhere. While a hostile Senate blocked necessary legislation thp sheikh of the Euphrates, Abdul Wahid, brought his tribesmen out and f; the Government officials of Abu Sukhair to their offices. In other re’ 6 ^ although there were no open demonstrations, tribal sympathy was almost with the opponents of Ali Jaudat, and there is reason to believe that a° H diversions had been promised in the event of the Government’s attenmt' assert their authority on the Euphrates by force. The only element which ralhll to the support of the Wihdah party was the group of sheikhs who for tr hsl reasons, were habitually antagonistic to Abdul Wahid. These proclaimed th &amp; loyalty and offered to fight their tribal rivals. Their weight was however Z enough to restore the balance. Two Wihdah Cabinets fell in quick and Yasin and his friends came into power. 4 successi ^, 7. His end achieved, Yasin Pasha found himself in a position that was hv no means easy. He had provoked something like a revolution. He had set motion forces which he might well be unable to control, for he had let the tribes see their real strength. His Government were now confronted with the task of implementing the promises made to their supporters. They set about coaximr the Kurds into patience. To would-be Deputies they gave fresh hope by the dissolution of Parliament, while the extreme Nationalists were quietened bv thp sight of Yasin Pasha once more at the head of affairs. With the Shiahs it was more difficult to settle accounts. The Ulema of Neiaf and Kerbela seized tho opportunity to draw up a list of demands which went further than the Govern ment wished to travel along the path to fuller Shiah participation in public life I hen* claims were rendered more formidable by the support which they won from tnbes hostile to Abdul Wahid. This combination was the most difficult of the new Administration s immediate problems, for it had hitherto respected the authonty of government and had moved along constitutional lines P But the Government also had to settle with Abdul Wahid, who clearly expected a handsome reward for the decisive part he had played in the overthrow of Ali th?nrL * S ° me TT k u he pra A nce f about Ba gdad, where he was acclaimed by the press as a great leader.

The occasion has met with a resnonse which is, I think, not a little surprising in a country which has only so recently achieved national status. Leaders have come forward ready to shouMer responsibility, and the people have gone some way to demonstrate their Xlity to combine m order to secure the redress of grievances, and here and there with some apparent realisation of the limits beyond which pressure cannot be carried without danger of anarchy In short, recent events may be read as indicating the beginning of a national consciousness and promise of that inherent ability of the people to manage their own affairs in their own way upon which His Majesty’s Government pinned their faith when they first decided to set Iraq free from mandatory control. 4 10. Future developments from this situation must depend in a great measure upon Yasin Pasha himself. The circumstances which I have described above place him in a position of power not enjoyed by any previous Prime Minister in Iraq. If he uses this power wisely, his Government may enjoy the stability necessary to enable him to carry out a number of important schemes of develop ment, which have long been delayed on account of the constant changes of Government which have occurred during the past, three years. He may be able to overcome the vested interests which obstruct the way to many necessary administrative reforms and to raise the level of efficiency in the civil service. He is also well placed to introduce measures to quicken the national consciousness, which has germinated during the last few months, and to strengthen the sense of unity with which a common grievance and a common purpose has endowed those formerly mutually alien elements which His Majesty’s Government have tried to weld together into the Iraqi nation. 11. Although no other better fitted is, at present, in sight, one cannot be sure that Yasin Pasha is the man either to draw up or to carry out so sound a programme as this. But, as I have explained, the strong position in which he finds himself is without precedent in Iraq, since he owes it purely to a movement of his own creation. It has now been made even stronger by his present successful suppression of an unpopular tribal rising. May he be trusted not to abuse this power ? Many of those in close touch with men and affairs in this country warn me that Yasin Pasha is dreaming of dictatorship. Others say that talk of dictatorship has been common in political gossip for years and that not much importance need be attached to it now. 12. The situation is, however, singularly favourable to a radical change in the constitution of the country. The King is a young hypochondriac, without experience, character or influence, and the throne itself is too recent an institution to have deep roots in the affections of the people or in their history or tradition. No profound shock would be caused if it were swept away. Mustafa Kamal and Riza Shah have shown the way, and, strange though it may be, Hitler, as a gieat Watani or Nationalist, has found much favour in political circles in Iraq. A dictatorship might, therefore, be little opposed in principle. 13. Yasin Pasha is possessed, moreover, of several personal advantages which should help him in any attempt to seize supreme power. His brother is Chief of the General Staff and virtually the head of the army, the Director ot Police is completely under his influence and his Cabinet, including a presen even Nuri Pasha and Jafar Pasha, are, I should say, well under his thumb, a ar Pasha could be dropped overboard any day without fear of the consequences, as he has no influence in the country. Nuri Pasha is, however, bamse o en ere i - with dreams of absolute power, and, while he is in no sense e o a . ssun ^ L now, he would probably be one of the most difficult obstacles m the way of success, if Yasin Pasha were to attempt anything like a coup a E a .14 I am far from wishing to suggest by these observations that some sort of revolutionary upheaval is certain to take place in the near future. My purpose is to sketch the features of the situation and to adumbrate possible further developments One of these, but by no means the only one, is that of a bid for supreme power by Yasin Pasha, and, in the special circumstances which I have described above this eventuality seems not too remote to warrant an effort to appreciate the effect which it might have upon the relations of His Majesty’s Government with Iraq. 15 If Yasin Pasha succeeded, much would depend upon his attitude towards the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 and upon his general policy. If he honoured the Treaty of Alliance, showed reasonable signs of observing Iraq’s international obligations, and had a sound programme for the internal adminis tration of the country, I do not think that the situation would give rise to any embarrassments to His Majesty’s Government. At the same time, although now there is °Pod ground to think that he sets some store by the treaty, from his past record it is reasonable to foresee that Yasin Pasha may work firmly for the earliest possible replacement of the present close alliance between the two countries by some instrument that would bind Iraq less tightly to ourselves. This outcome would probably be a logical development from the policy of His Majesty’s Government in regard to Iraq and would presumably, therefore, not unduly trouble British interests. If, on the other hand, after achieving dictatorship, Yasin Pasha were to repudiate the treaty or were to adopt a policy in internal or external affairs of which His Majesty’s Government could not approve, it /might be necessary to reconsider the whole question of our relations with Iraq. There might, indeed, be much to be gained, in such circumstances, by the termina tion of the special responsibilities which His Majesty’s Government, at present, bear under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance. 16. It cannot, however, be assumed that an attempt to carry out a cony d’ £ tat would necessarily succeed. The present circumstances have many favourable elements, but 'there are other factors which would make the risk of failure very grave. Kivalry and jealousy are always close to the surface in public life in Iraq and no one could attempt to seize supreme powmr without creating a host of bitter enemies. The Plema can also be relied up&gt;on to oppose strongly the concentration of dictatorial power in Sunni hands. Failure might, therefore, quite easily attend any effort to overthrow the present constitution and, in the struggle, very serious disorders might well occur. How far, and in what manner, His Majesty’s Government would be affected by such a sequence of events it is impossible to foretell and a policy to meet it could only be evolved as the situation developed. 17. The conclusion to which I incline, after consideration of the many uncertain factors in the situation which I have endeavoured to appreciate, is that, although the future is likely to be full of interesting and probably important developments, the prospect need not cause anxiety. At the same time it is well that His Majesty’s Government should be aware that some radical change in their relations with this country may become necessary in the course of the next few years and will, in my opinion, certainly be called for before the expiry of the statutory duration of the Treaty of Alliance of 1930. 18.

[E 3601/1583/93] Sir A. Clark Kerr to Sir John Simon.—(Received June 11.) (No. 295.) Sir, Bagdad, May 29, 1935. WITH reference to my despatch N g 283 of the 22nd May, I have the honour to report that during the past week the IraqilToveriiment have continued steadily to restore their authority in the disturbed areas on the Euphrates. 2. Many Muntafiq sheikhs have made their submission and, although tranquillity has not yet been completely restored in the Suq-al-Shuyukh district, the recalcitrant elements of the Hachcham tribe are rapidly being deserted by the others and left to their fate. 3. Through trains have been running between Bagdad and Basra since the 23rd May, and the Rumaitha column reached Tall-al-Lahm on the 27th May en route for Suq-al-Shuyukh. Two motor-boats armed with two 2-75 guns and six Vickers machine-guns, hastily improvised in the Basra port, overawed the tribes on the Hammar Lake and reinstated the Mudir of Chubaish without firing a shot. The police officer in charge, excited by his success, telegraphed to Bagdad that ‘ ‘ the victorious Iraqi fleet, having rehoisted the noble Iraqi flag, was steaming ahead to destroy all rebels and traitors.” Thus easily does the Iraqi temperament achieve exaltation. 4. In Basra confidence has been restored and H.M.S. Lupin left the port on the 24th May. 5. In Rumaitha all is now quiet, although martial law still remains in force. Khawwam-al-Abbas, the insurgent leader, who was wounded and captured on the 16th May, has been sentenced to death, but it is not certain whether the Government intend to execute him. The sentence may possibly have been passed in order to intimidate others. , . ^ . 6.

(No. 267.) to my telegrams No. m of the 8th ^'iSToUhe 13th May, I have the honour to furnish you with the following details of the deterioration which has taken place during the past week in the situation in the Midcile and Lower Euphrates areas. 2. As I have stated in a number of previous reports, the most pressing of the immediate problems confronting Yasin Pasha’s Cabinet was the pacification of the tribal elements of the Middle Euphrates hostile to Abdul Wahid. Yasin Pasha and his colleagues themselves quickly appreciated this essential fact Since taking office, the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Interior have tried every means of reassuring these sheikhs. They have also been fully supported by Nun Pasha, who, as a member of the Ali Jaudat Cabinet, enjoys in a large measure the confidence of the tribes now so bitterly jealous and suspicious of a GrOvernment which appears to them to have been put into power by their tribal enemies. 3. Throughout April representative sheikhs of these tribes paid constant visits to Bagdad, and conferred frequently with the principal Ministers and with Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, all of whom persevered in their efforts to convince the sheikhs that the Government would govern justly and would not show preference to Abdul Wahid and his supporters. In order to demonstrate their impartiality, the Government published on the 15th May an official communique announcing the suspension of the activities of the Hizb-al-Ikha-al-Watani (the party of National Brotherhood), the political party of which the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Interior are the leaders. The Prime Minister gave, in addition, private assurances that, in the forthcoming parliamentary elections, the anti- Abdul Wahid sheikhs would be given as many seats as they had had in the last Chamber. Strenuous efforts were also made by intermediaries to reconcile the two tribal factions and to persuade the Ulema of the Holy Cities to stop fishing in troubled waters. Some of those concerned were won over, but others remained obstinately mistrustful, and Kashif-al-Ghata, the turbulent divine of Karbela, clung tenaciously to the sectarian demands to which I referred in my despatch No. 171 of the 28th March. These demands have not yet been formally presented to the King or to the Government, but many of the anti-Abdul Wahid and Muntafiq sheikhs have given binding promises to support the Ulema in their struggle for the Shiah cause. 4. Involved and tortuous negotiations continued throughout April, and by the beginning of May there were signs of improvement, which strengthened hopes of a peaceful settlement. At this juncture, however, the Cabinet took an ill- advised step. They learned that in Rumaitha a certain Shiah priest, named Ahmad Asadullah, a follower of Kashif-al-Ghata, was inciting the local tribes against the Government. He was arrested on the afternoon of the 7th May an removed to Bagdad. That evening the local tribes, the Abu Hassan the Bam Zuraij and the Dhuwalim, revolted. Under the lead of the Sheikh 0 6 ani Zuraij, Khawam-al-Abbas, they tore up the railway line on both sides of the town and looted the station and the bazaar. The railway personnel were ab e to escape and have since found their way to Bagdad. The police success 11 y ^ serai, but, since the evening of the 7th May, no trains have een run sou ^^“^OnrheZtrng'rthlsth May, several Royal Air Force machines passed over Rumaitha, and one machine, which flew low over the to^, appears to a c been hit by rifle fire and forced to land with the loss of two lives. On the follow day the Air Officer Commanding sent a special service o c [406 dd—1] 33'?-quarters to Diwaniyah to endeavour to recover the two bodies. With the help of the mutessarif and a local saiyid he succeeded in despatching a letter to Sheikh Khawam-al-Abbas, who at once sent in the bodies decently covered in cloth and reeds. In his letter the sheikh explained that his tribesmen had fired on the aeroplane because they thought it was attacking them with machine guns. The Air Officer Commanding assures me that this was impossible, as the guns of the machine had not been made ready for action when the flight left Hinaidi. The most probable explanation is that the tribesmen mistook the Boyal Air Force machines for Iraqi aircraft, many of which have lately been carrying out recon naissances over the Rumaitha area. 6. On the evening of the 9th May, I visited the Prime Minister, who is Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs in the absence of Nuri Pasha, He expressed great regret at the death of the Boyal Air Force officer and gunner and for the loss of the British aeroplane. He agreed with the view that the tribesmen had fired on the Boyal Air Force machines because they mistook them for an Iraqi reconnaissance.' At my suggestion he undertook to publish a communique, making it clear that the flight'of British aircraft was unconnected with the operations to restore order, which were being undertaken by the Government. I enclose herein a copy of the communique which appeared in the press on the 10th May.^) 7. So soon as Bumaitha was attacked, the Minister of the Interior went to Diwaniyah in order to study the situation, and to make a last effort to arrange a peaceful settlement. On the afternoon of the 9th May, handbills were scattered over the area from Iraqi aeroplanes, warning the tribes that, unless they dispersed to their homes within twenty-four hours and resumed their normal lives, the Government would be forced to take punitive action against them. 8. The tribes made no response, and on the morning of the 11th May, after warnings had been dropped that women and children should be removed from the villages, aerial bombing began and has been continued daily. Simultaneously arrangements were made for the concentration at Diwaniyah of 5 infantry battalions, 1 field battery, 1 mountain battery and 1 company of motor machine guns with auxiliary troops. Three companies of an infantry battalion were also sent from Basra to Samawah, and thence occupied the important railway bridges at Barbuti and Imam Abdullah. General Bakr Sidqi Pasha was put in command of all troops between Hillah and Basra, and martial law was proclaimed in the Rumaitha nahiyah. On the morning of the 12th May, a column comprising the bulk of the troops concentrated at Diwaniyah began a movement southwards towards Rumaitha. 9. The situation on the morning of the 13th May was promising. The moral effect of the air action taken by the Iraqi air force was reported to have been good. Tribal gatherings were dispersing, a number of sheikhs of the Rumaitha area had made their submission and the nephew of Khawam-al-Abbas had made overtures for terms for his uncle. The Prime Minister told me that he was hopeful that the troops would be able to reoccupy the district without serious fighting. Later in the day, however, there was a change for the worse. Telegrams from Nasiriyah reported that the restlessness of the Muntafiq tribes was at last turning into open revolt. The tribes in the neighbourhood of Suq-al-Shiyukh had risen and were attacking the local serais in Suq-al-Shiyukh, Akaika and Qarmah Bani Said. The Mutessarif of Nasiriyah was asking for troops to be despatched urgently to his help. 10. On the 14th May it was reported that the rebels had captured Akaika, and the mutessarif, fearing an attack on Nasiriyah itself, asked urgently for ammunition and reinforcements. A battalion of infantry was sent off from Bagdad in motor cars to try to get through to Nasiriyah via Kut and the Hai, and the Iraqi air force were called upon to take down supplies of ammunition. Unfortunately, all their aircraft were bogged in the waterlogged aerodrome at Diwaniyah, or already engaged either in bombing raids on the Rumaitha front or in transporting ammunition to the beleaguered police at Suq-al-Shiyukh. Fearing that Nasiriyah might be attacked that night, the Prime Minister made a personal appeal to me to help him by sending ammunition to Nasiriyah in a Royal Air Force Victoria. For the reasons which I have already explained in my telegram No. 141 of the 14th May, I did not feel able to consent to ask the Air Officer Commanding to comply with the Prime Minister’s request. U Not printed.11 . During the night of the 14th-15th May the railway line between Basra and Nasmyah was cut at Tall-al-Laham and Suq-al-Shiyukh Town was occunied by the rebels, the police, however, continue to hold out in their post ' , VZ J he f ?r e l°l i he ^f.rapent at Diwaniyah seem adequate to restore order m Rumaitha, but there is little left m reserve to move against the powerful tribes of the Muntafiq Confederation. The one line of communication with the Nasinyah hwa, which remains open, is down the Hai from Kut. The attitude of the tribes on the Hai is most uncertain, and there is a danger that thpv win join the revolt. Much will depend on Sheikh Khaiyun-al-Ubaid, thf Sheikh of the Abudah tribe at Shatrah. If he joins the insurrection, the Nasiriyah liwa will be cut off from all help, unless the Government forces restore order in Rumaitha and move southwards down the Euphrates into the Muntafiq area I understand that the column moving south from Diwaniyah is approaching Rumaitha to-day and a decisive action may be fought during the next twenty-four hours. 13. The danger of the revolt spreading is not limited to Diwaniyah and Nasiriyah. The anti-Abdul Wahid and pro-Shiah sheikhs have many powerful sympathisers in the Hillah liwa, between Diwaniyah and Bagdad. If they also rebel, the forces now operating in the Middle Euphrates will be cut off from the capital and their position will then be precarious. 14. It is unnecessary for me to emphasise the dangerous potentialities of the situation. They will be clear enough to you from the above narrative. Events are moving towards a trial of strength between the Government and the Euphrates tribes, and it is by no means certain that the Government will win. 15. In Bagdad the situation is at present quiet and normal, though naturally a variety of changing rumours are in constant circulation. The members of the late Government do not seem to be taking advantage of Yasin Pasha’s difficulties, and I am told that they have given no encouragement to their tribal supporters to join in the insurrection. The press unanimously condemns the rebel sheikhs and calls for the sternest repressive measures. 16. The Government endeavoured to deal with Sheikh Asadullah by deporting him to Persia, on the plea that his claim to Iraqi nationality was invalid. The Persian Government have, however, not yet agreed to accept him. Meanwhile he is in Khanaqin. 17. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. I have, &amp;c.

Clark Kerr to Sir John Simon.—(Received June 3) (No. 283.) ® lr &gt; „ ^ , , , T Bagdad, May 22, 1935 WITH reference to my despatch No. 267 of the loth May last, I have the honour to inform you that the situation on the Middle Euphrates and in the Muntafiq Province has greatly improved during the past week. nv/r May Jafar Pasha the Minister of War, accompanied by Mr. Ditchbuin, new to Nasiriyah m an Iraqi Air Force machine to consult with the mutessarif and to speak to a gathering of tribal sheikhs of the Muntafiq Confederation. 3. The situation in the Nasiriyah liwa was then critical. On the previous day 300 police had surrendered with their arms to the insurgents at Suq-al-Shiyukh, and there was good reason to fear that the tribes of the Shatrah on the Hai, might join the insurrection, and thereby cut the only remaining route by which reinforcements could be sent to the Muntafiq area. The tribes in the vicinity of Nasiriyah were truculent, and it was believed that an attack on the town was imminent. 4. On arrival at Nasiriyah, Jafar Pasha first interviewed the Shatrah sheikhs. His friendly manner quickly put them at their ease, and his speech, in which he emphasised that if disorder prevailed Iraq would be judged unfit to govern herself, made a considerable impression on his audience. The Nasiriyah sheikhs then joined the meeting and, after further conference, Jafar Pasha agreed to a truce. The conditions were that the Government should open negotiations at once with the Alim, Kashif-al-Ghata, regarding the Shiah demands (the text of which was enclosed in my despatch No. 171 of the 28th March), and that, pending the conclusion of these negotiations, there should be no further hostilities in the Nasiriyah liwa. Jafar Pasha further agreed that during the truce no troops, other than the two battalions already en route for Nasiriyah, should be sent to the Muntafiq area. For their part, the sheikhs also undertook to arrange for the release of the police and other officials who had been captured by the tribes in Suq-al-Shiyukh. On the same day the first of the two battalions, which had been despatched from Bagdad in lorries, reached Nasiriyah via Kut and the Hai, and adequate supplies of small-arms ammunition were sent down by aeroplane. A second battalion arrived on the following day. All immediate anxiety for the safety of Nasiriyah town was thus removed, and when Jafar Pasha and Mr. Ditchburn returned to Bagdad on the 17th May the situation was much easier. 5. While the events described above were taking place the troops advancing from Diwaniyah were fighting a successful and decisive engagement with the Rumaitha insurgents. Their machine guns inflicted heavy casualties on the tribesmen and Sheikh Khawwam, the local leader, and his brother were wounde and captured. The following day (the 17th May) the column enterea Rumai a and the insurrection in this area was at an end. The advance was continue ie next day, and on the 21st May the column reached Samawa. 6. The complete success of the operation at Rumaitha left the overnmen free to deal with the situation in the Nasiriyah liwa Negotiations were opened with Kashif-al-Ghata through Haji Muhsm-al-Shallash, a very wealthy merchant of Najaf, who at one time was Minister for Finance, an e j persuaded to send an exhortation to the Muntafiq tribes o ®fP ® P -J prevent all fighting. How far negotiations on the “ demands themselves have progressed I have not yet heard, but I gather that Yasm ] as ( ^’ _ A an q p 1 sympathetic to the idea of greater Shiah participation m 16 .] , ulema to the public services, is very much opposed to recognising e represent the Shiah community in political affairs. [431 c—2]SWS1 7. The tribes of Suq-al-Shiyukh duly released all the captured officials and policemen, but minor skirmishing with police patrols and posts on the railway line continued to occur between the 17th May and the 20th May. In neighbourhood of Nasiriyah also, in spite of the truce, the local tribes committed further depredations. The police were attacked, culverts on the railway were destroyed, and telephone and telegraph lines were pulled down or cut. The mutessarif was therefore instructed on the 19th May to warn the sheikhs concerned that the Government regarded these activities as a breach of the truce made at Nasiriyah, and would therefore no longer be bound by its terms. 8. The situation in Nasiriyah caused anxiety in Basra, as the town had been denuded of troops and police to reinforce those engaged in the operations. In these circumstances, His Majesty’s consul arranged with the senior naval officer, Persian Gulf, that H.M.S. Lupin, which was at Basra at the time, should remain in the port pending an improvement of the situation. 9. The present position is that the Nasiriyah sheikhs are asking for lenient terms; they have promised to restore the culverts and dykes damaged by their tribesmen, and the sheikhs of Suq-al-Shiyukh are negotiating their submission through friendly intermediaries. The work of repairing the railway, the damage to which it is impossible to estimate at the moment, is being rapidly pushed forward, and there is hope that within forty-eight hours through trains will again be running between Basra and Bagdad. It would appear, therefore, that the Government now have the situation well in hand. 10. During the critical period the Prime Minister kept in close touch with His Majesty’s Embassy. At my suggestion, Mr. Ditchburn, wffio has expert knowledge of the disturbed areas, was put on special duty at the Ministry of the Interior to collect reports from all sources and to inform this Embassy and Air Headquarters of the daily developments in the situation. I also had frequent interviews with the Prime Minister, at which he spoke to me frankly about the difficulties of the Government. On the evening of the 15th May I met him at a dinner-party given by the Government to M. Olivan. The position was then grave and Yasin Pasha was clearly very anxious. He told me of his plan to send Jafar Pasha and Mr. Ditchburn to Nasiriyah on the following day to interview the Muntafiq sheikhs, and confessed that Mr. Ditchburn, on account of his long service among the Euphrates tribes, had more influence among them than any other official of the Iraqi Government. He asked me to make a special appeal to him to do his utmost to persuade the tribes to be patient and to have confidence in the Government. He also requested me to authorise him to make it known that His Majesty’s Government regarded with disfavour the outbreak of lawlessness among the tribes. I agreed generally with the Prime Minister’s requests and authorised Mr. Ditchburn to speak to the sheikhs in the sense already reported in my telegram No. 143 of the 16th May. He did not, however, nnd it necessary to make full use of this authority, but considered it sufficient to inform the sheikhs that in his private opinion His Majesty’s Government, while ---g tf* 6 welfare of all the people of Iraq, would not approve of the lawless methods adopted by the tribes to bring their grievances to the attention of the Government. 11. I also asked Mr. Ditchburn to try to ascertain the causes of the outbreak among the Muntafiq. He reported on his return that all the sheikhs were p edged to support the demands put forward by Kashif-al-Ghata and must con mue to struggle for their acceptance by the Government unless told by the ulema to desist. a ? n Ma Y’ while the result of both the Nasiriyah negotiations and the advance of the column at Bumaitha was uncertain, Yasin Pasha made ° r a d emo . n ® tra ti° n by Royal Air Force machines, which I reported 6 e e j? ram to which I have referred in paragraph 10 above. I expressed Q ihT i J m b a ^ with the Government’s difficulties, but explained that I could not TT- ii se . £ 1T } on stration flights without prior reference to you, and I feared that S V 1 overnm f nt would regard such a flight as an undesirable P le 1 ? 1 ? 1 their policy of non-intervention in internal disputes.

Section 1. E 2686/278/93] Siv A. Clark Kerr to Sir John Simon.—{Received April 29) (No. 211.) Sir, Bagdad, April 17 1935 WITH reference to my despatch No, 200 of the 11th April, I have the honour to report that no important developments have occurred during the past week in the internal situation. 2. The first ten days of Muharram have passed quietly and the police orders, prohibiting street processions were obeyed without serious protest. 3. It is said that Sheikh Abdul Wahid is nervous and fears that he is being deceived by his political friends. Those of the tribal leaders opposed to him, who are still in Bagdad, are outwardly most indignant at the action taken against their men at Rumaitha and Shinahyah on the 8th April (see paragraph 4 of my despatch under reference), but the local officials report that these incidents have had a beneficial effect. The new Mutessarif of Nasiriyah is optimistic, and reports that a show of firmness should suffice to restore tranquillity. 4. The dissolution of Parliament is naturally regarded with disfavour by the anti-Abdul Wahid sheikhs, who fear that in the next elections the Diwaniyah seats will be filled with Abdul Wahid’s nominees. The Minister of the Interior has, however, done his best to reassure them by promising that the next Parliament shall be truly representative of all elements in the country. In the press the dissolution has been generally approved, the only adverse comment coming from an editor who will most probably lose his seat. 5. One of the effects of the dissolution has been to defer the passing of the budget for the current year until Parliament meets in the autumn. The Minister of Finance told me to-day that, in these circumstances, the terms of last year’s budget will apply, and that any urgent additional expenditure will be provided for by Order in Council (“ marsum ”), which will be submitted to Parliament for approval. It seems probable that some such action may be taken in respect of a second bridge over the Tigris, which the Prime Minister declares himself to be bent upon building. 6.

The latest telegrams on the file report that further disorders have broken out in the Middle Euphrates district near Rumaitha. As recently announced in the press, an R.A.F. aeroplane carrying out a reconnaissance &lt;n&gt;£\. the affected area (not of course on behalf of the Iraq Government) has been shot down in flames and the two occupants are missing. The tribal elements at present in revolt belong to the anti -Abdul Wahid faction and appear to be those who have always in the past been pro- Government and incidentally also pro-British. They supported the then Iraqi Cabinet in the original disturbances caused by Abdul Wahid 3330 1000 12.34and instigated by Rashid Ali -al-Gilani, who is now Minister of the Interior in the present Iraqi scot-free. Cabinet. Thesetribes are naturally displeased at Abdul Wahid’s success and they have never looked with favour upon the present Iraq,! Cabinet, some of wnose members, including Yassirt Pasha, the Prime Minister, are deeply committed to the Abdul Wahid faction. The present outbreak seems to be due to the arrest by the Government of Sheikh Assadullah, a prominent Shiah Sheikh of Rumaitha belonging to the anti -Abdul Wahid faction. Meanwhile Abdul Wahid, who arrived in Bagdad in April with a large retinue of his supporters and was received by the Minister of the Interior, has been posing as the champion of Iraqi unity and attacking his tribal opponents as the enemies of national integrity. The Shiah riot at Kadhimain last March (see the submission at P.Z. 2187/35) is reported to have been due to the stupidity of the local Kaimakara in ignoring the religious sentiments of the people (P. Z. 3108/35 ); a number of persons accused for their part in these riots are being tried at Bagdad and are liable^if found guilty^to be sentenced to deatn.

The anti Abdul Wahid tribes who have always viewed the present Government with disfavour have thus been given an excuse for a religious uprising.

The anti-Abdul Wahid sheikhs remain profoundly mistrustful of Rashid Ali-al-Gilani. I have the impression, However^ that Muri Pasha, who has had frequent interviews with their representatives in Bagdad, has to some extent succeeded in winning their con- hdence. bir Kmahan Cornwallis has, in his turn, worked tirelessly to°dispel their suspicions and to convince them of the wisdom of patience and moderation For the present they are mainly concerned in watching Abdul Wahid, with whom the nevt move lies. 3. Witli Abdul Wahid himself the Cabinet have achieved some success and have so far managed to keep him on their side. The ulema had induced him to visit them at Najaf, but they could not persuade him to sign their manifesto of sectarian demands. On the 1st instant he arrived in Bagdad with a train of thirty motor cars. He was immediately received by the Minister of the Interior, and it is believed in some quarters that he pledged his support to the Cabinet against the combination of the erstwhile pro-Government tribes and the divines of the Holy Cities. In other quarters, however, it is considered that his intention in coming to Bagdad is to get into touch with the Kurdish delegation and with other sheikhs now in the capital, with a view to formulate demands counter to those adopted by the ulema. The main features of these demands are expected to be the dissolution of Parliament, to be followed by a general election, and the maintenance of the present Organic Law as the only safeguard for national unity. He wishes thus to be able to show up his rivals as treacherous enemies of national integrity and himself to pose as the apostle of State unity. 4. Sheikh Muhamad Husain Khashif-al-Ghata, having failed to obtain Abdul Wahid’s signature to his Shiah demands, has been talking of issuing a fetva condemning him as an infidel, but Abdul Wahid seems unlikely to be moved by this threat and boasts that he will soon send the alim back to his prayers and his rosary. Meanwhile, without the unanimous support of the Middle Euphrates, Khashif-al-Ghata is hesitating to put forward to the Government his Shiah charter. Indeed, it is doubtful whether those who have already signed would consent to his doing so without the signature of Abdul Wahid. 5. Meanwhile, tribal unrest continues to spread, as will be seen from the enclosed copy of a translation of a pact which has been made between the sheikhs of Suq-al-Shuyukh in the Nasariyah liwa.( l ) The signatories (about twenty tribal leaders)' have telegraphed to Khashif-al-Ghata pledging their support to the people of the Euphrates. The tribes of the inaccessible Hammar Lake are also reported to be restive and disturbed. 6. From many sources I have received reports that the Persian Legation continue closely to interest themselves in current events, and, acting on instructions from Tehran, to do their utmost to increase the difficulties of the Iraqi Government. 7. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. I have, &amp;c. ARCHIBALD CLARK KERR. p) Not printed.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 178 of the 2nd April, I have the honour to report the loilowmg developments in the political situation in Iraq. 2. Abdul Wahid is still in Bagdad with a large number of supporters and is actively engaged in intrigues and negotiations. Several large gatherings have been arranged which have been attended by sheikhs from many different parts of the country. At these gatherings, speeches have been made calling for the defence of national unity and condemning all those who seek to put sectarian interests before the integrity of the kingdom. Both Abdul Wahid and the Kurdish delegations have also issued, through the press, a joint pronouncement of their abhorrence of all that tends to create dissensions among the people and of their determination to stand for national solidarity under King Ghazi. 3. Negotiations with the Government continue, but with no definite results and no agreed form of demands has yet been presented either by Abdul Wahid or the Ulema. Meanwhile, the sheikhs are beginning to fall out amongst themselves and Shalan-al-Atiyah has for the moment broken with Abdul Wahid because the latter will not support his demand for a grant of 25,000 acres of land which he claims was the promised price of his support against Ali Jaudat. 4. On the 8th April small skirmishes took place at Rumaitha and Shinafiyah between armed tribesmen and police patrols. A few men were wounded on both sides, but the police seem to have kept the upper hand. In the Nasiriyah liwa tribal unrest is still evident and now shows a tendency to develop into agrarian agitation against the big landlords. The Government have removed the mutessarif and have replaced him by Majid Beg, a Kurd who has done remarkably well in the north. He is, however, a stranger to the tribes of the Muntafiq confederation. 5. The Mutessarif of Diwaniyah is being transferred to Kut, and his place will be taken by Saiyid Hashim, the present Assistant Director-General of Police. 6. Parliament w r as dissolved on the 10th April before the expiry of the adjournment of one month, which began on the 12th March. Ali Jaudat and Jamil-al-Madfai endeavoured unsuccessfully to dissuade the King from taking this course. If His Majesty had not dissolved Parliament, Yasin Pasha would presumably have resigned, and, as Ali Jaudat and his party could certainly not have formed a Cabinet, the King had no choice but to allow Yasin Pasha to carry on the government of the country on his own terms. 7.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 84 of the 25th March, I have the honour to inform you that the Iraqi Government have appointed Mr Ditchburn to enquire into the rioting which occurred in Kadhimain on the 23rd March. His report is not yet complete, but some facts have come to light which I ‘think it advisable to bring to your notice. 2. It appears that the trouble was primarily due to resentment aroused by the stupidity of the local kaimakam, who, ignoring the religious sentiments of people, permitted a post office to be built on ground which is venerated as having been a cemetery for over a thousand years. fo 3. In spite of the fact that work on the building had apparently been going on for nearly three months, the grievance of the populace was unknown to the interested Government departments in Bagdad. Nor had any inkling of the trouble reached the Embassy. This is the more surprising when it is remembered that Kadhimain lies only some 4 miles to the north of Bagdad, and that normally every event in the Holy City is immediately echoed in the capital. 4. These circumstances suggest that something more than popular indignation at the desecration of the ancient cemetery lay behind the sudden outburst of last Saturday. The obvious hypothesis is 'that this grievance, like others, was exploited by intriguers for political purposes, but it is premature to discuss this theory in detail until Mr. Ditchburn has finished his investigations. 5. Meanwhile, the shops in the bazaar of Kadhimain remain closed, the people are sullenly thronging the streets, and normal life is at a standstill. EASTERN (Iraq). April 8, 1935. ^ CONFIDENTIAL.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 171 of the 28th March, I have the honour to inform you that during the past week some forty chiefs, representing; the principal Kurdish tribes of the Kirkuk liwa, and some of those in the Arbil and Sulaimani liwas, visited Bagdad with the object of representing grievances and asking for reforms. &amp; 2. Prior to their visit, the leading members of the deputation had met together and had prepared a petition for submission to the Prime Minister, a translation of which is enclosed herein. Subsequently, many other tribal aghas put their signatures to it. The requests put forward appear to be moderate, and, had the Administration been efficient, most of them would have been satisfied long since. 3. The deputation have not yet formally presented their petition, and I understand, that Rashid Ali Beg hopes to dissuade them from doing so by giving them general oral assurances of redress. It is said, with what truth I do not know, that the aghas concerned have sworn on oath to continue to press their demands until they receive satisfaction. 4. The Kurds have no doubt taken advantage of the existing situation in the hope of finding the Government more ready than hitherto to listen to their grievances. 5. The officially inspired notices which have appeared in the press betray the Government’s idea that there is something to be gained by winning the support of the north as a counterweight to Shiah agitation in the south. The aghas are represented as having come to the capital solely to pledge their support of and full confidence in the Cabinet. There is no mention of demands or grievances, and the newspaper readers are left with the impression that the purpose of the deputation is to demonstrate the readiness of the Sunni Kurds to stand with the Government against the Shiah uprising on the Euphrates. That this deliberate misrepresentation of the facts may lead by way of reaction to a closing of the Shiah ranks is a possibility which the Cabinet have apparently ignored. I have, &amp;c.

WITH reierence to my despatch No. 159 of the 21st March, I have the honour to report the following developments in the political situation in this country :— 2. On the 20th March, yielding to the persuasion of intermediaries sent by the Cabinet, Abdul Wahid dispersed his tribesmen and repaired the four road bridges which they had previously destroyed. 3. On the following day Nuri Pasha and Rashid Ali-al-Gilani, the Minister of the Interior, left Bagdad for the Diwaniyah liwa and spent the whole of the 22nd March and the morning of the next day visiting the towns of Diwaniyah, Shamiyah and Afaj, where they interviewed large gatherings of sheikhs. Sheikh Shalan-al-Atiyah and Sadun-al-Rissan were brought in to see them by Saiyid Muhain-abu-Tabikh and Saiyid Alwan-al-Yasiri, two Senators who had been actively associated with Rashid Ali-al-Gilani in his intrigues to overthrow Ali Jaudat and Jamil Madfai. 4. Shalan and Sadun are the two outstanding leaders of the disturbances in the Daghgharah area. It was these men who seized the irrigation regulator and who were also responsible for destroying the crops and road houses of several villages belonging to another local tribe with whom they are at feud. Both sheikhs were haughty and at first spoke truculently of insisting on the fulfilment of their demands. Ultimately, however, they were prevailed upon to disperse their armed gatherings, and on the following day their tribesmen were withdrawn from the Daghgharah regulator, which was thereupon occupied by a strong force of police. 5. In Shamiyah the Ministers found a formidable group of armed tribesmen of the anti-Abdul Wahid and erstwhile pro-Government groups. In his talk with their leaders, Rashid Ali gave the most solemn undertakings that the Government would deal impartially with all the tribes and would show no special favour to any particular sheikhs. His audience remained unconvinced, and many of those present told him openly that they did not trust his word. Some even went so far as to demand the resignation of the Cabinet and the appointment of ^neutral” Ministers. It appeared, therefore, that the Ministers’ tour had achieved little. On his return, Nuri Pasha was gloomy and felt strongly that the authority of the Government would not be restored unless and until disciplinary action were taken. He advocated a concentration of force in the Daghgharah district and the imposition of an exemplary fine on Shalan-al-Atiyah. Rashid Ali, true to his reputation, would express no sincere opinion. He endeavoured to claim that he had successfully cleared up all difficulties, but added that, in future, the Government should be supported by stronger forces, lo this end, he hoped immediately to create five additional battalions, and appeared to think these could be produced overnight like mushrooms. 6. From conversation with Nuri Pasha, I gathered that, wheieas he wished to take action against Shalan-al-Atiyah and believed that this was the best way to restore order and give satisfaction to the anti-Abdul Wahid sheikhs, Rashid Ali and Yasin Pasha contended that, as Abdul Wahid and Shalan had dispersed their tribesmen, there was no need to punish them for their recent defiant aemon- strations. On the contrary, force should be used, if necessary, against the ai Ai~ Abdul Wahid groups to compel them to abandon their present hostility to the Cabinet. The truth appears to be that Rashid Ah, as the chief instigator o Abdul Wahid’s recent activities, is too far committed to be able to move against him, though he is incensed by the hostile reception given him by the others when he visited them a few days ago. [381 h—1] l7. Meanwhile, as I suggested in the final paragraph of my despatch under j reference, the Ulama of Najaf have begun to make common cause with the anti | Abdul Wahid sheikhs. The Sheikhs of Shamiyah and Afaj have been persuaded : to sign a manifesto of Shiah demands and Sheikh Muhammad Hasan Kashif-al f Ghata, one of the leading divines of Najaf, has issued a minatory fatwa • (encyclical). Copies of both of these documents are enclosed herein.Q 8. Many, indeed most, of the demands of the manifesto appear to be reasonable and, to a large extent, justified. If they had been advanced in a constitutional manner, they would have deserved the early and serious attention of all wise Iraqi statesmen. The present danger lies not in the demands them selves, but in the attempt to impose them on the Government by force. If the Government surrender to the tribes, they may find that they no longer have the authority to rule. On the other hand, if they resist, they may be d°rawn into a fatal struggle. 9. The sheikhs who have signed the manifesto and joined the Ulama have done so not so much because they are sincerely interested in Shiah ecclesiastical or political aspirations, but because they think that by this step they will rob Abdul Wahid of the initiative and put him in an impossible position.

[E 2096/278/93] SzV Aerr to Sir John Simon—{Received Avril 11 (No. 159.) 1 Si 11 , Bagdad, March 21, 1935r- ^ WITH reference to Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes’s telegrams’Nos. 78 and 79 of the 18th March, I have the honour to furnish you with the following further details of recent political developments in this country :— 2. Sir Francis Humphrys, in his despatch No. 130 of the 6th March, expressed doubt whether the Cabinet formed by Jamil Beg A1 Madfai would be capable of dealing with the situation which had brought about the resignation of their predecessors. His misgivings were soon proved to be well founded. The change of Cabinet did nothing to appease the Opposition in Bagdad or to pacify the rebellious sheikhs in the Middle Euphrates. On the contrary, propaganda from Bagdad was intensified and tribal defiance continued to spread. 3. As a conciliatory measure the Mutessarif of Diwaniyah was instructed by the Government to tour the disturbed areas and to interview the tribal leaders with a view to ascertain their grievances. He met with little or no success, and Abdul Wahid (the outstanding personality of the Middle Euphrates) and his supporters declared their determination to maintain a defiant attitude until their demands had been satisfied. They alleged that these had been communicated to the King and Government and were, of a nature which could not in any event be dealt with by local officials, to whom they refused to communicate details. 4. On the 10th March, while the Government were still undecided how to act, news reached Bagdad that Abdul Wahid’s men had destroyed three small bridges in the neighbourhood of Abu Sukhair (about 12 miles south-east of Kufa). This caused considerable alarm and appeared to be a counter-move to the arrival of police reinforcements from neighbouring liwas. The Government sent an ultimatum to Abdul Wahid to repair the bridges and withdraw his men within twenty-four hours, and preparations were made for the despatch of troops to restore order. Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, the adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, advised His Majesty’s Embassy that the situation was graver than any he had known since his arrival in the country in 1921. 5. Abdul Wahid, in his reply to the ultimatum, declared that he stood for the defence of the Constitution, that his tribe had been concentrated for that purpose, and that he had destroyed the bridges to prevent a clash with the police. Thereupon the new Minister for the Interior himself visited Diwaniyah, but achieved nothing. 6. Meanwhile, in consequence of the irresolution of the Government, the situation further deteriorated. Tribesmen under Sheikh Shalan-al-Atiyah seized an important irrigation regulator above Dagharah (40 miles south-east of Hillah) and armed tribal demonstrations became increasingly frequent in the Shamiyah, Dagharah and Diwaniyah districts. The Abu Sukhair Nahiya passed entirely under the control of Abdul Wahid, and the Government officials were practically besieged in the local Government offices. ... . 7. In these circumstances, military dispositions became necessary m order to protect the important provincial centres on the Middle Euphrates and to march a column into Abu Sukhair. Infantry units were despatched to Hillah, Diwaniyah and Samawah. and a column consisting of two battalions of infantry, thre^sections of field artillery and a motor machine-gun company was moved from Hiiiah on the 13th March. It reached Abu Sukhair without opposition two days later. Several air reconnaissances were also carried out over the disaffected area by aircraft of the Royal Iraqi Air Force. 8. The Minister for the Interior continued to explore every possibility oi persuading the insurgent sheikhs to disperse their tribesmen and to put orwar their grievances for examination. His efforts were, unfortunately, fruitless, and the recalcitrant sheikhs refused to give way. On the 14th aici an o ~ cia communique was issued, a copy of which is enclosed herein. ( ) (*) Not printed.9. Not all the tribes of the Middle Euphrates joined the anti-Government movement. Those with long-standing or traditional hostility towards Abdul Wahid, and the section of the Fatlah tribe subordinate to his influence, rallied to the support of the Government and met the war-dances of theTFatlah with counter-demonstrations of warlike intentions. The local officials received offers from these tribes to attack the insurgent elements, but, not wishing to plunge the whole district into tribal warfare, they wisely declined them and counselled patience. 10. On the 15th March the troops were in position, but the Government faced with the necessity for taking a decision, hesitated to employ force to restore their authority. It may well be that they were actuated by a genuine reluctance to embark on a course of action which, they were warned, would probably lead to civil war. On the other hand, they were by no means sure that the army would fight. Many of the officers were believed to be strongly in sympathy with the Government's opponents, and the majority of the rank and file, being Shiahs, could not be expected to have much zeal for fighting against their co-religionists. ’ Some few officers actually refused to proceed to the “front,” and the men of the punitive column, on reaching Abu Sukhair, fraternised closely with the local inhabitants and were reduced to tears by the appeals of the women not to shed the blood of their brother Arabs and co-religionists. In any case, it was quite clear that most of the Cabinet shrank from the responsibility of taking the only course bv which it seemed possible for the Government to assert its authority. 11. The advent of the religious festival of A1 Adha offered an excuse for procrastination, and on the 14th March the Cabinet, still hesitating to strike postponed a decision until after the holidays. !2. The following day they resigned.' The source of the impulse which brought them to this decision is not accurately known, but it seems likely that the iking caused them to understand that they were not in his view the right combina tion to deal with the situation either by force or conciliation. Most of the Ministers it may readily be believed, were only too glad to escape from their dilemma’ i few da 1 ys 1 lS nSmg ^ ^ ° ffiCe S ° ful1 ° f h ° pe and S ° cheerfu11 ^ onl y -p n ^ King immediately sent for Yasin Pasha and the formation of the following Cabinet was announced on the 17th March Prime Minister Hashimi.

To those no read between the lines, this pronouncement of policy, coupled with the3 crush him, and feel that after his success in overthrowing two Cabinets he will ' become an intolerably insolent neighbour. They also anticipate that he will in siMjii future, dominate the Government officials in the liwa and that, in consequence there will be small chance of their being given a square deal in the land, water and Mil other disputes which are the mam interests of tribal life in this part of the tiieir Ik country. ckrifi 17. Nevertheless, as the anti-Abdul Wahid groups constitute the better- 1 behaved and more law-abiding elements in the province, the Government will, in matiofs all probability, win them over in the end by smooth talk and fair promises’ to which end the mutessarif has already set out to visit them. With Abdul Wahid Kin Mi a settlement is likely to be sought by giving him substantial satisfaction, while at the same time making provision to save the face of Government. 18. If events shape in this way, all may be well for a while, but I am advised that, in the long run, the elementary fact that a comparatively small tribal combination has successfully overthrown two Cabinets and brought about the dissolution of Parliament (if this occurs) will gravely impair the authority of the Government as a ruling institution, and that in the next few years serious v|' consequences may ensue. Certainly, judged by all the accepted canons of good a™ government, this appreciation seems justified. On the other hand, it is evident RaiiiM that if, in the prevailing circumstances, Jamil Beg A1 Madfai’s Cabinet had attempted to impose their authority on the Middle Euphrates by force, they would nance, # have run a very serious risk of disastrous failure, the consequences of which might i andli well have been immediate and overwhelming. While I hesitate to form a positive prepaid| opinion on this complex situation so soon after my first contact with the men and 0 f affairs of this country, it appears to me that the King has probably chosen the j ia ’ s palittj less dangerous of the two admittedly exceedingly hazardous and unsatisfactory * Rauffi{| alternatives which were open to him. If time can be gained by the early liquidation of the present situation, it may be possible to devise palliatives for the evils which may arise in the future. 19. From all the reports I have seen since my arrival, it appears clear that there is nothing anti-foreign in the unrest on the Middle Euphrates. There is, j however, a distinct danger that the source of its inspiration may shift from / Bagdad to Najaf and Kerbala, in which case the struggle would probably cease to he one between the Government and certain tribes, or even between uue tribal j group and another, and would become a religious war between Sunni and Shiah. . on T tUic rlpsrmteh to His Maiestv S Ministers at I Jo0 20.

WITH reference to my telegrams Nos. 54 and 56 of the 28th February and the 4th March, I have the honour to report the circumstances of the resignation of Ali Jaudat Beg’s Cabinet and the return to the premiership of Jamil Beg A1 Madfai. 2. For the past two months Rashid Ali-al-Gilani, Hikmat Suleiman and Taufiq Suwaidi, together with a number of extreme Nationalists, have been seeking, by all the means in their power, to force Ali Jaudat to resign. They organised a strong Opposition bloc in the Senate, and, by intriguing with disaffected tribal elements in the Middle Euphrates area, they brought about a state of unrest which might have developed into an armed outbreak against the Government. Ali Jaudat also had difficulties with his colleagues. Arshad-al- Umari had made himself unpopular by his drastic dismissals of senior personnel from the departments under his Ministry (Economics and Communications), and had incurred popular opprobrium on account of his loose living. Jamil Beg A1 Madfai, who commanded the largest vote in the Chamber, threatened to resign whenever the smallest difference of opinion occurred between him and his chief. 3. Ali Jaudat endeavoured to face the situation with firmness, and sought to strengthen his position by reorganising his Cabinet. His plan was to drop Arshad-al-Umari and to persuade Jamil-al-Madfai to accept the Presidency of the Chamber. He failed, largely because Jamil-al-Madfai threatened to resign and join the Opposition if Arshad-al-Umari were asked to withdraw. Ali Jaudat’s resourcefulness was not equal to dealing with this situation, and, in spite of encouragement from Nuri Pasha, he gave up the struggle and resigned. 4. Acting on the advice of the Presidents of the Senate and Chamber and of Ali Jaudat himself, the King then sent for iasin Pasha and entrusted him with the task of forming a Cabinet. His Majesty stipulated that this should be a Coalition or National Cabinet, that none of those who had recently taken part in intrigues with the Euphrates tribes should be included, and that he should not be asked again to dissolve the Chamber. Jhese conditions were, m my opinion, wise, and their necessity was recognised by Tasin Pasha himseit. A party Cabinet chosen from the Ikha-al-Watam (party of JSational Bro er- hood), to which most of the Opposition belonged, could not have secured a working majority in the Chamber, and to have dissolved a am er w scarcely been in existence for three months would have mace e ma } parliamentary government appear absurd. Similarly, to lave r £ tribal the men who had been principally instrumental m stirring up turbulent tr ^ elements would have created a dangerous preceden , w ic g “f ’sssasassa.. give up the attempt to form a Government ho on the 3rd March, 6. The King next sent for Jamii-al Maoia , , obtained Royal approval for the following Cabme . Prime Minister : Jamil-al-Madfai. Interior : Abdul Azziz-al-Qassab. Finance : Yusuf Ghanimah. Foreign Affairs : Nuri Pasha. Justice : Tauriq Suwaidi. Defence: Rashid-al-Khoja Economics and Communications . Education : Abdul Husain Chalabi. [356 s—1]2 7. Considered individually the Cabinet has many good qualities. The Prime Minister is popular and enjoys a reputation for honesty. Nuri Pasha has an extensive experience of Iraq’s foreign affairs, and always works amicably with His Majesty’s Embassy. Abdul Azziz-al-Qassab combines a detailed knowledo-e of administration with the experience gained during several previous terms of^office. Rashid-al-Khoja, Amin Zaki and Yusuf Ghanimah are moderate and reasonable men, well acquainted with the business of the departments which they will now direct. On the other hand, the Prime Minister is well known to hold unsound views on the subject of the Assyrians and to be ill-disposed towards the retention of British officials in administrative positions. Taufiq Suwaidi is not trustworthy, and his appointment to the Ministry of Justice is therefore not well conceived. 8. In spite, however, of the merits of the majority of its members, it is somewhat doubtful whether the new Cabinet will be able for long to carry on the government of the country, or to deal effectively with the present polftical situation. They are, it is true, assured of a strong majority in the Chamber, but this did not save the previous Cabinet from collapse. The presence of Taufiq Suwaidi brings the support of his brother, Naji Pasha, and a consequent diminution of opposition in the Senate, but there seems at present little likelihood that the change of Cabinet will result in any weakening of the campaign of opposition which has recently been carried on by Rashid Ali and Hikmat Suleiman and their associates. Nor does it seem probable that this reshuffling of portfolios will in itself put an end to unrest on the Euphrates. Positive steps must be taken to deal with both these factors if the new Cabinet are to establish their authority and remain long in office, and I am by no means convinced that they are equal to the task. 9. At a meeting of the Chamber, held on the 5th March, the new Prime Minister made a short pronouncement of policy, the main part of which was a declaration of the intention of his Cabinet to carry on the construction work begun, but not completed, by their predecessors. Atf 'the #arile meeting Ali Jaudat Beg was elected President of the Chamber in the place of Rashid-al-Khoja. 10.

Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. The most important paper is Sir Francis Humphrys’ telegram of 13th March at P.Z. 1802/35 The disturbances appear to have been instigated in the first instance by disgruntled politicians and in particular by Eashid Ali-al-Gilani,^ex-Prime Minister, (Bagdad despatch No,35 of 17th January at P.Z.1089/35), but they have now assumed the I yrfn of a serious tribal revolt. The chief leader of the rebel tribesmen is Abdul Yfahid, the influential and troublesome Sheikh of the Fatlah tribe. The situation is now extremely critical, and the loyalty of the Iraqi Army is doubtful since the officers are being tampered with by political propaganda and/ 3 330 1000 12.34- m /■ it ! L / 3 r&gt; r P&gt; f If! h - and many of the men are Shiahs and cannot,be relied on in operations against Shiah tribesmen. The Government are sending troops against the insurgents and plans are also being made for air action against the tribesmen. It is to be hoped that if bombing is resorted to the Government will see that due restraint is exercised; otherwise the situation may become still more dangerous. With this in mind Sir Francis Humphrys recently made arrangements with Major-General Hay for lectures to be given to the officers of the Iraqi Air Force on the tactics employed by the R.A.F. in operations for the suppression of tribal disturbances, laying emphasis on the principle that such operations should be aimed at imposing order not by inflicting casualties, but first by producing a moral deterrent effect (P.Z.1757/35). The latest telegram on the file (P.Z. 1857/35) reports the resignation of the Iraqi Cabinet 0 n 16th March and that the King had ©ailed upon Yasin Pasha to form a Cabinet, and it was announced in yesterday's 'Times' (extract attached) that a new Cabinet has now been formed with Yasin Pasha as Prime Minister. The new Cabinet includes Bashid Ali-al- Giiani, formerly one of the instigators of the trouble, and the CoTernment may now be strong enough to deal successfully with the situation. , 2 6 MAR 1955 SEEN POLITICAL COMM ITT* 1 -r k- ' r 1 '*^--4 vw 1/3 ClTWA^' =&gt; OoAo Ik, ycrt'llf* ^ jLf* h ‘to- An/ / AiJ’.NDEXE In any further communication on this subject, please qmi No. jf and address —not to any person by name, but^o^ 1 The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, Londo P. ?;. &gt; '1857 !

The King and Nuri Said agree and ways and means are being actively considered. The Id A1 Adha which begins on March 15th and lasts for four days introduces new complication* Opposiuion are believed to be organising mass demonstrations in Bagdad against Government, while hands of Government are to some extent tied by reluctance to embark on repressive measures during Holy Festival. On the other hand, if action is not quickly taken to restore authority of Government the movement of defiance will undoubtedly spread and strengthen.In any further communication on this subject, please quote \ ' ‘ No. ^| and address —not to any person by jtame, but td— ‘ u “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W, 1. | ' , / l j J » / v, / j fV o THE Under-Secretary of State| for Affa|rs presents his compliments to ^ and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop of the under-mentioned paper.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 35 of the 17th January, I have the honour to report that the situation in the area of the Middle Euphrates is still far from satisfactory, while a majority of Senators, by a process of non- co-operation, have brought the legislative business of the Government almost to a standstill. 2. The attack of the Opposition, which is led by Rashid Ali-al-Gilani and Naji Pasha Suwaidi in the Senate, and by Hikmat Beg Sulaiman, ex-Minister of the Interior, outside, seems to be directed mainly at the person of the Prime Minister, who is regarded as chiefly responsible for the ‘ £ unconstitutional ’ ’ act of dissolving the Chamber, and Arshad Beg A1 Umari, whose high-handed methods have provoked wide-spread dissatisfaction. The Prime Minister has informed me privately that he has decided to sacrifice Arshad Beg A1 Umari at once and has Offered the portfolio of Economics and Communications to Jafar Pasha, and is inclined to request Tewfik Beg Suwaidi to become Minister of the Interior, in order to silence his brother in the Senate. J afai Pasha tells me, however, that he prefers the Ministry of the Interior, as he foresees great difficulties in the future in the application of the National Service Law, and thinks that he could use his influence tactfully to prevent undue precipitancy m annlvinn conscription to the tribes. However this may be, I suspect that Jatar Pasha’s real motive is to get into his own hands the extensive patronage for his friends which the Ministry of the Interior will afford him. . . + , , 3 There are signs that the sheikhs of the Middle Euphrates, incited b&gt; Rashid Ali-al-Gilani and a considerable body of lawyers in Bagdad wdl continue to work for the removal of the Prime Minister from office The situation rendered more than usually dangerous by the rumours that are prevalent Bagdad that King Ali is secretly behind this movement and is even playing wi the idea of supplanting King Ghazi and becoming Regent himsell 4 It is renorted that the Persian Minister m Bagdad nas not oeen siuw , to avail himself of the opportunity of fostering di y e y, i q ^^1 fronfbeing and the Shiahs of Iraq with a view to preventing a united national front g presented to Persia in the matter of the Hon mr i p ' • p q g^ r Kinahan P 5.

[E 623/278/93] No. 1. Sir F. Hum'phrys to Sir John Simon.—(Received January 28.) (No. 35.) p Bagdad, January 17, 1935. IN continuation of rny despatch No. 22 of the 10th January, I have the honour to report that the Opposition group, in addition to their activities in the Senate, are now seeking to work up agitation against the present Government among the sheikhs of the Middle Euphrates. 2. Their chief instrument is Abdul Wahid-al-Haj Sikkar, sheikh of the Eatlah, one of the most troublesome and influential sheikhs of this area. In the recent general election he was not included in the Government’s list of candidates for the Diwaniyah division, and, in consequence, lost his seat. He has taken this very much to heart and has readily fallen in with the plans of Rashid Ali-al- Gilani and Hikmat Sulaiman. According to information which I have received, Abdul Wahid has been hurriedly settling personal and local differences with other sheikhs of the Middle Euphrates area with a view to forming a united front. He has also been in close touch with Saiyid Muhsin Abu Tabikh—an influential j landowner of the neighbourhood and a member of the Senate who has a long ( record of intrigues against all Governments. I 3. The Opposition have also obtained the support of other tribal sheikhs of the Euphrates who have either lost their seats in the Chamber or have been disappointed in their hopes of being elected for the first time. Among such men they find many ready to listen to their attacks on the Prime Minister, whom they accuse of having sold seats in the Chamber to the highest bidder, and of having kept the lion’s share of these bribes for himself. So far, however, their efforts to widen the front of their attacks on the Government by bringing into the struggle the Ulema of Kerbala and Najaf, through the Shiah tribal leaders, have not proved successful, the Ulema being by no means disposed to take sides in what they have sufficient wit to see is only a struggle between two groups of Sunni politicians, neither of which is really concerned to further the communal interests of the Shiahs. 4. Other elements in the country have also been rallied to give evidence of hostility to the present regime, and many telegrams have been sent to the Opposition newspapers applauding the animadversions on the Government contained in the Senate’s reply to the speech trom the Throne. Jhese have come mostly from Nationalist groups or from disgruntled office seekers, and have been countered by other messages inspired by local officials, in which numerous signatories declare their faith in the present Cabinet. Many of the pro-Govern- ment sheikhs from the Middle Euphrates have gathered in Bagdad during the past few days to give assurances of their loyalty and support. The Go^rnment themselves are, I understand, quite confident oi their ability to deal effective y with Abdul Wahid and have under consideration plans for bringing turn to heel by threatening to take action against him for one of his many past misdeeds 5. They are now more perturbed, however, by the situation in the Senate^ It appears that the Opposition have succeeded m concentrating a strong group 0 about half the Senators, and it is feared that they may endeavour to block legislation passed through the Chamber by the Government majority. It is possible that, as soon as the Prime Minister returns from Geneva he will try to improve the position in the Senate by_ making several changes_m his Cabinet. He may aspiraiits tor . C.Mnot post i*» - Arahad-al-Umari, the present Minister for Economics , whose drastic methods have made many enemies for the Government, may be asked to give place to someone less arbitrary. [308 ee—2]6. From the point of view of the general welfare of the country, a struggle between the Government and the Senate need cause no anxiety. If the activities of those out of office are confined within the four wails of Parliament, nothing more momentous than a reshuffle of Cabinet Ministers is likely to result. But if influential public men deliberately incite disgruntled sheikhs and ignorant tribal elements to resort to force to overawe the Government, a serious situation may rapidly develop, which will severely test the statesmanship of the young King 1 and his Ministers. „ , . 1 , TT . ^ . 7.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 701 of the 12th December last, relative to the recent general elections, I have the honour to report that His Majesty King Ghazi opened the new Parliament on the 29th December. 2. The speech from the Throne, a translation of which is enclosed here with, ( x ) contained no surprises. Touching first on foreign affairs, His Majesty referred to the frontier dispute with Persia and reaffirmed the willingness of his Government to enter into direct negotiations with the Persian Government if the latter so desired. 3. His Majesty then mentioned the important financial institutions which the Government were planning to set up—an allusion to the schemes for the establishment of Central and Agricultural Banks which, as you are aware, are at present occupying the attention of the Ministry of Finance. He also fore shadowed further amendments to the Capital Works Law. I am unaware of the nature of these amendments, but will make the necessary enquiries. 4 The reference in the speech to the “ proposals for the improvement of existing judicial institutions” probably indicates a desire on the part of the Government to examine further the possibility of reorganising the Civil Courts of Appeal.on the lines of the proposals discussed m my despatch No. 660 ot the 10th November last. Your comments on these proposals have been communi cated to the Minister of Justice, who is now aware that, before any change can be effected in the existing system,, the consent of the Council of the league will have to be forthcoming. The Adviser to the Ministry of Justice has promised to keen me informed of any developments in this matter. 5 Referring to the Government’s educational programme His Majesty made special mention of the necessity for an increase m ^PonYr sSof’s schools and in technical education.

Bagdad, January 10, 1935. 1 ’ WITH reference to paragraph 7 of my despatch No. 3 of the 3rd January, t have the honour to inform you that I now learn that Yasin Pasha and his oolitical associates have, for the present, decided not to withdraw from the Chamber. Instead, they are apparently organising a centre of opposition to the Government in the Senate, where Naji Suwaidi and Rashid Ali-al-Gilani, both clever debaters and experienced politicians, are now co-operating with Yasin Pasha 2 The first attack was launched on the occasion of the debate on the sneech from the Throne, which took place in both Houses on the 3rd January. In the Chamber Yasin Pasha spoke at length, but with his customary ambiguity. His main points of criticism were the action of the Government in dissolving the old Chamber without, he alleged, adequate justification, and the elections them selves which he declared had been improperly conducted. Very few other sneakers, however, gave him any support, and the reply to the speech from the Throne prepared by the Government, of which I enclose a translation herewith, (} was adopted by a large majority without amendment n'n ai; d 3 In the Senate the attack was more successful. Led by Rashid Aii-ai- Gilani and Naji Suwaidi, a number of Senators hotly criticised the Government. Their strictures followed in the main the same lines as those of Yasm Pasha, but they struck, in addition, a popular note by calling m question the Govern ment’s drastic dismissals and disciplinary transfers of omcials. 4 Jafar Pasha A1 Askari, Jamil Beg Madfai (Minister for Defence) and Jamal Baban (Minister for Justice) did not appear to advantage m their defence of the Government. Their contention that the Government, m their dissolution of Parliament and their conduct of the elections on the usual lines, had y acted in the same manner as their predecessors and F e ® en ET a n\n^eked in the inherent weakness of the tu quoque.

The memorandum is interesting but not very encouraging as regards Indian trade with Iraq, which is probably less at present than ever before, amounting to less than 9% of total imports and to just over 10^ of e^orts. Indian cotton imports are 19/ on paper but thi amount includes imports from Japan which are re-exported via India. The other principal Indian imports are tea (16/) and timber (19/).

Memorandum respecting Commercial Interests of British India in Iraq. (Communicated by His Majesty's Embassy at Bagdad, November 28; Received in Foreign Office, December 10.) THE commercial relations of India with Mesopotamia appear to go back at least as far as the year 1639, when a British factory was established at Basra. By the year 1661 the volume of these relations, and the frequency of visits to that port by merchantmen of the East India Company, had so far developed that it was deemed necessary to define the rights and obligations of British traders in Mesopotamia, with particular regard to sea and river-borne traffic, in a treaty between Great Britain and Turkey. These rights and obligations were confirmed and amplified by subsequent treaties negotiated at varying intervals of time, and although India is not specifically mentioned therein, the traders whose interests it was sought to protect or promote were, in general, more closely associated with India than with Great Britain itself or with any other part of the British Dominions or Dependencies. With the development of steam navigation and the resultant speeding-up of communications, the tendency was for traders established in India to lose their predominant position in the foreign trade of Mesopotamia in the face of competition by firms in Great Britain and on the continent of Europe; and of recent years Japanese competition has made its appearance, with the result that at the present moment India’s share of the trade of Iraq is probably lower than / it has ever been before, amounting to less than 9 per cent, for imports and to just over 10 per cent, for exports. Her share of the cotton goods import trade is still quite considerable on paper (19 per cent.), but a quantity, not easily or exactly ascertainable, of imports of this category classified as of Indian origin on the ground that they reach Iraq from Indian ports are, in reality, Japanese manu factures, exported in the first place to India and thence re-exported to Iraq India’s other principal exports to Iraq are tea (16 per cent, of the total) and timber (19 per cent.). Of Iraqi produce, India takes a considerable quantity of dates (36,000, of a total of 114,000, tons in the financial year 1932-33), these being the cheaper varieties of that commodity, and some wheat and hides and skins. The number of Indian and Anglo-Indian residents, permanent and temporary, in Iraq is very large, falling probably not far short of 30,000. They may be divided into six categories, as follows :— (a) Permanent residents in the Shia Holy Cities of Kerbala and Najaf. (b) Pilgrims to the Shia Holy Shrines. (c) Pensioners of the Indian Government. (d) Employees of Iraqi Government Departments, in particular, the Iraq Railways iVdministration. (e) Domestic servants. (/) Individuals engaged in commercial pursuits. The number of Indian Shia Moslems belonging to category (a) must be in the neighbourhood of 20,000. Only an approximate computation is possible, since there is no system of compulsory registration of British subjects in force, and there has hitherto been little advantage in the possession of documentary proof of British nationality by these individuals. With the enactment of a Military Service Law in Iraq, however, considerable importance may in the near future attach to the possession of foreign nationality papers, and already applications to the British consulate at Bagdad for passports are increasing rapidly in number. But it cannot be said that the persons comprised in this category exercise, or are ever likely to exercise, any influence on the commercial exchanges between India and Iraq. They are not, as a rule, traders, and have, indeed, as is usually the [281 k—1]2 case with Shia Moslems, little aptitude for commerce; while, as consumers, they have no preference for Indian products, having lost all touch with India and having become, in the course of generations, indistinguishable in customs, as in speech and appearance, from the Arab and Persian population. (b) Indian pilgrims to the Holy Shrines and Cities number on an average between 3,000 and 4,000 annually, the majority of whom are of the poorer classes. Their influence on commerce is negligible. (c) Pensioners of the Indian Government permanently resident in Iraq number some sixty-nine persons, the amount of their monthly pensions varying from 3 to 4 rupees to 650 rupees or more. Only those in receipt of comparatively large pensions, who are few in number, maintain any sort of connexion with their country of origin. (d) The number of British Indian nationals employed by Iraqi Government Departments was very considerable during the British occupation of Meso potamia, and in the early stages of the mandatory regime in Iraq. At the present time there are few British Indians so employed outside the Iraq Railways Administration. That administration bears on its pay-rolls some 180 persons of British Indian extraction, most of them being employed in subordinate capacities. These individuals are domiciled in India and spend their periodical leave in India; and their presence in Iraq operates to create a demand for Indian products of various kinds. It is inevitable, however, that they should decrease in number as Iraqi nationals become fitted to perform the duties at present assigned to non-Iraqis. (e) A number of Indian cooks, personal servants and laundrymen are employed in Iraq, the idea of domestic service being essentially foreign to Arab mentality. Indians are, nevertheless, being slowly displaced by Iraqis in this sphere of occupation, a process to which the exorbitant wage demands of the former contribute not a little. (/) Commercial pursuits. There is no British Indian firm or individual engaged in commerce on a large scale in Iraq. The qualifications of the native of British India are not, in general, of a nature to enable him to compete in the larger commercial fields with European firms, whilst in retail trading they are no match for the Bagdad Jew. There is one Indian shipping agent in Iraq, Haji Jethabthai Gokal, of Basra (with head office at Joria Kathiawar, India, and a branch at Karachi), holding the agency of the Swedish East Asiatic Company (Limited), of Gothen- berg, and of the Eastern Steam Navigation Company, of Bombay. In tailoring and outfitting, the Indian merchants are supreme, all the prin cipal bespoke tailors being natives of India. They do not compete in the ready made clothing trade, but a number of them are concerned with the importation of second-hand clothes. Most of the Indian outfitting firms also deal in sports goods. The principal ice factory, a commodity in increasing demand in Bagdad, is nan by the Indian firm of K. S. Abdul Ali and Co., who are also large importers or paints and varnishes. A number of Indian firms deal in fancy goods, Indian silks and embroideries and curios. Foi the iest, Indians are engaged in a variety of forms of retail trade, geneially of minor importance, of which some indication mav be obtained from the list enclosed m this note.^) It will be gathered from the contents of this memorandum that the prospects rpn 1 e , a,se d commercial exchanges between India and Iraq are not encouraging. e 11 1 j m population of Iraq, and, in particular, that section of it which serves j o promo e the commercial relations between the two countries, must inevitably vaecrease m size as the technical equipment of the Iraqi improves; whilst in the ■^ gei corn me i cial field the principal Indian products have to contend with e ?

This matter is still under consideration by the Government of India. Bagdad, November 1934. C. A. W. WERE.COPY BRITISH EKB SSY, (E 5130/190/92) T&gt; P)Qi a BA.GDVD. 25th August,1934.

The memorandum below which is mo-Ui-in-e-d j primarily from the point of view of United Kingdom as distinct from British Indian interests gives a very interesting review of the considerable extent of British commercial interests in Iraq in the post-war period. The position is not unsatisfactory, but we cannot afford to be too optimistic about the future. The serious threat of Japanese competition which is touched on towards the end of the memorandum has been dealt with in detail In a separate report from Bagdad which has already been submitted. The position of the British Group in' the British Oil Development Company referred to in paragraph 4 on page 2 is not so satisfactory as the memorandum suggests, sincelater information shows that the British Group was in fact unahle to raise its share of the aead rent payment to the Iraq Government in January last, and that the money was put up By the Italian Group who have, as a result, supplanted the British GI’QUP an ^ r temporarily? in the position of majority shareholders in the Company; papers on this question are being separately submitted. / *LJ) ’ p. tWV'tftu.. &lt;r+ S ~1 f-eh ? ^ &lt; n 3 4 Secretary, Political Department. This Report is noticeably ac&amp;ttwi about fcjzi-fcish Indian commercial interests in Iraq. Perhaps you would consider whether H.M. Ambassador in Baghdad could be asked to supplement it by a Memorandum on British Indian commercial interests in the country. I suppose this might be done unofficially through the Foreign Office. There is some advantage, particularly in respect of Eastern countries, in having occasional evidence that H.M.

[E 3526/190/93] Memorandum respecting British Commercial Interests in Iraq.—{Communicated by His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad; Received May 29.) PRIOR to the war Great Britain occupied a paramount position in the trade of what is now Iraq. Of the total import trade of the country the United [Kingdom’s share was between 45 and 50 per cent., and that of India about 25 per cent.; while the United Kingdom was also the principal customer, taking some 35 per cent, of the exports. Trade was for the most part in the hands of old and well-established British firms, such as Lynch Brothers, Gray, Mackenzie and Co., and Frank C. Strick and Co., though in the period immediately preceding the war two or three German firms had made their appearance in Basra and Bagdad and showed signs of becoming serious competitors. The bulk of the shipping serving the port of Basra was under the British flag, and river transport, providing the quickest and most economical means of communication between Basra and Bagdad, was carried on by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, a British firm. Individual British traders (British Indians engaged in retail trade) were few in number, and their influence on the current of trade was negligible. The early post-war period was a time of dislocation of trade in abnormal conditions, which may, indeed, be said to have prevailed, with a gradual but insufficiently marked tendency towards rectification, up to the year 1926. In that year a collapse occurred, and many unsound businesses were eliminated; in the two succeeding years long overdue adjustments of the country’s economy came about, and from 1929 onwards a process of consolidation has been in progress, which has enabled Iraq to face the universal economic depression and the fall in the world prices of agricultural produce, her principal source of income, without recourse to measures in restriction of imports, and without disastrous results. In the three years ending with the financial year 1932-33, Iraq’s total trade, exclusive of transit trade, has amounted annually to approximately £8,500,000. In these years the visible adverse balance of trade has varied considerably, but this variation can be traced to special circumstances. When allowance is made for these the normal visible adverse balance can be placed at £1,500,000 annually, the normal visible balance in favour of the United Kingdom being about £850,000. The United Kingdom’s share of the import trade, though showing a distinct falling-off as compared with pre-war years, has remained remarkably steady throughout the post-war period, averaging 35 per cent., with a maximum percentage of 39- 2 in 1920-21, and a minimum of 26-33 in 1925-26. Her share of the export trade was not equally consistent, owing to special and non-recurring conditions, which obtruded themselves from time to time. Normally, it would stand, in the post-war period, at 20 per cent, of the total. In 1932-33, the latest year for which statistics are available, the United Kingdom provided 34-92 per cent, of Iraq’s imports, while taking 37-36 per cent, of her exports. The latter figure was, however, unnaturally swollen by the export of ^£5004)00 worth of gold, more than half the total value of Iraq’s exports to the United Kingdom. Imports from the United Kingdom in that year amounted in value to £2,179,000. These figures and percentages, satisfactory as they are in themselves and in comparison with similar percentages in respect of the external tiacle witn me United Kingdom of adjacent foreign countries, do not by any means fully represent the importance of British interests, other than political, m Iraq m general. These other interests are in the main of post-war growth. His Majesty’s Government are themselves directly concerned with the port of Basra and the Iraq Railway Administration In the case of the port, then interest, though gradually decreasing, will not be finally extinguished fo i„ ano e , r nineteen years. The Iraqi railways are actually the property of His Majesty s Government, whose ownership thereof will eventually be transferred to a lai way corporation controlled by a board of British and Iraqi directors, m retur fo [106 ff—31 Bpreferred stock to be issued by the corporation ot the nominal value of some £2 million The directors of both of these administrations are British, and their technical and administrative staffs are composed predominantly of British subiects At the present time British subjects in the service of the Iraqi Railways Administration and of the Port Administration number respectively seventy-four and fifty-five, exclusive of British Indians occupying subordinate positions. This aspect of British interests in Iraq, the employment provided for British subjects, should be given full weight in considering also the details which follow concerning British commercial activities in the country. With the single exception of Egypt, there is no foreign country in the Near and Middle East where British commercial interests are at the moment so well established and of such extensive scope as in Iraq. It is difficult to estimate accurately the amount of British capital invested in the oil industry alone. The capital of the Iraq Petroleum Company' (£6,500,000) and its subsidiary, Mediter ranean Pipe-Eines (Limited) (£9,178,000), is owned as to 23-75 per cent., by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and as to a further 23-75 per cent, by the Anglo- Saxon Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch-Shelrgroup), French and United States interests owning between them 47 per cent, of the balance. It is specified in the company’s convention that it shall remain a registered British company, and that its chairman shall at all times be a British subject. The majority of the company’s technical employees are British and all other responsible positions in Iraq are filled by British subjects. The machinery and material necessary to its operations are predominantly of British manufacture. For the pipe-line construction alone approximately 200,000 tons of material have been imported into Iraq, and the possibility of laying one or more further pipe-lines, should the demand justify it, is already being envisaged. The Khanaqin Oil Company and its subsidiary, the Rafidain Oil Company (the marketing concern for the sale of oil products in Iraq, formed in accordance with the terms of the first-named company’s concession) form part of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company; the Khanaqin Oil Company at present extracts annually from its field at Naft Khaneh about 60,000 tons of fuel oil, 15,000 tons of kerosene, and 12,000 tons of petrol, all of which is consumed in Iraq. These quantities do not, however, represent a maximum. In both companies all responsible positions are filled by British subjects. Mosul Oil-fields (Limited) are the operating company for the British Oil Development Company’s concession in Northern Iraq. As originally constituted, this concern consisted of British, French, German and Italian interests, the nominal capital being £1 million. Early this year difficulty arose over payment of the second annual dead rental of £125,000 gold (£190.000 sterling) falling due, according to the company’s concession, on the 1st January, 1934. The French gioup professed inability to subscribe further capital, and the financial situation U ^ eiman y P rec u&lt; ^ e( ^ any contribution from the German interests. Eventually e amount due was paid in full, the British and Italian groups between them contributing the necessary funds. The result of this mav well be that the French and German interests will be eliminated and the position of the British group , 7 ^ S ! d 1 era + b y stren p tben ed. The company’s operations are still in the experi- /l age ’ drillm g ls . proceeding at three points.

The latter 'are the aotualowners of the vessels engaged in this traffic and obtain all their material from the United Kingdom. The corporation are agents for a number of British shipping companies and for the Lloyd Triestino. Frank C. Strick and Co. (Basra) (Ltd.) are intimately associated with the shipowners Frank C. Strick and Co., of London, whose vessels provide a direct [ink between the United Kingdom and Basra, and for whom they act as agents. I^Y ar g also agents for the Yamashita Shipping Company of Kobe, whose vessels have recently begun to call at Basra. Motor Transport. The Nairn Transport Company are the principal transporters by the trans desert route between Bagdad and Damascus. The company is registered in Syria, with headquarters at Damascus, but they provide employment for a number of British subjects in Iraq. Dwyer and Co., of Bagdad, are also engaged in the trans-desert transport business, and are likely to extend their activities considerably in that direction in the near future. Insurance. The business of insurance in all its branches is in Iraq almost entirely in the hands of British firms representing British companies. The following is a list of British firms established in the country dealing with insurance of all descriptions :— Lumsden and Greene. Fowler and Co. Mesopotamia-Persia Corporation. African and Eastern (Near East) (Limited). Dwyer and Co. Andrew Weir and Co. Frank C. Strick and Co. Air Transport. The three air-transport companies now serving Iraq (Imperial Airways K.L.M. (Dutch) and Air Orient (French)) are all represented in Iraq, at Bagdad and Basra by British firms. Negotiations for the grant of a concession for internal air-services with extensions to Persia and to Cyprus, to be operated by an Anglo-Iraqi company, have been in progress for some time, and are still continuing. Agriculture. Latifiyah Estates (Limited) is a British company developing an agricultural estate of an area of 60,000 acres some 25 miles south of Bagdad. It is to their credit that they have managed to carry on through a period of exceptional difficulty; and, by a system of small-holdings exploited by Iraqi tenant farmeis with the advice and assistance of the resident British staff, they have done much to inculcate modern methods amongst native agriculturists. The British Cotton-Growing Association has recently suspended its cotton ginning operations in Iraq, but the association’s plant has been taken ovei } their manager for his own account. The association s decision was taken m consequence of the severe decline of cotton production in Iraq, due to t e pool prices available, but there appears to be no reason why a revival ot interest m cotton should not take place in due course. iscellaneous Imperial Chemical Industries (Levant) (Limited) is a subsidiary of the British company of the same name. They are importers of chemicals and chemica fertilisers and hold the agency for Humber and Hillman cars. • a Messrs. Murdoch, a British firm established m Cairo, have recently obtained the contract for the supply of bricks for the new Royal Air Force base at Dhibba , and their activities are likely to be extended in other directions m racp The Bagdad Light and Power Company is a British registered company holding the concession for the supply of electric power to the city of Ba c dad. I e manager is a British subject. ^ [106 fi—3] B '4 Messrs. Whinney, Murray and Co. are the only firm of chartered accountants in Iraq. Their principal business is at Basra. British firms are very largely interested in the general import and export business and have no serious foreign competitors. The principal firms so engaged are:— Messrs. Mesopotamia-Persia Corporation, with branches at Bagda Basra, Mosul, and at several centres in Southern Iraq, as well as in Persia. African and Eastern (Near East) (Limited), who are the largest exporters of Basra dates. Frank C. Strick and Co. David Sassoon and Co. (building material). Birch, Marr and Co. (agricultural machinery). Andrew Weir and Co. Fowler and Co. British participation in other branches of commercial activity covers a wide field. The Times Printing and Publishing Company owns the Iraq Times, the only foreign newspaper published in the country, with the exception of a Turkish newspaper which appears spasmodically. They are also printers and publishers, as are Mackenzie and Mackenzie, who own the principal bookshop, with a large and up to date stock of English literature. The capital of the Iraq Racing Company, which has done much for the improvement of horse-breeding, is largely British, and its salaried officials are British subjects. And there are British subjects engaged in such varied occupations as the cinematograph business, , auctioneering and the sale of motor accessories. Turning to the question of foreign competition in Iraq, it may be said at once that there are no signs as yet of any threat from outside to British supremacy within the country. The foreign holdings in the oil companies can scarcely be considered as competing with British interests. In the field of transport foreign shipping and aircraft companies are content to avail themselves of the services of British firms as agents; and there is only one foreign (American) firm actively engaged in the date export trade. It would, however, be unwise to conclude that the position is therefore static in this respect, and that British interests can be maintained at their present level without effort and irrespective of changes in the currents of trade and the channels of communication. In the sphere of Iraq s external communications by sea there have been patent signs of late of a growing challenge to British predominance from Italian and Japanese shipping interests. The Lloyd Triestino Company have recently inaugurated a two-monthly service of cargo steamers between Italian ports and tfasra, and Japanese cargo vessels are now calling at that port at approximately PI 1 ° f time ' ]H d ther of t*? 686 services may be expanded if the cargo „ i 6 ^ 1S 1 fT exten sion, and, indeed, in the case of the Japanese, this f p J obabl y onl y awaiting a solution of the problem of return cargoes monthly ^ ° apan ’ smce volume of Japanese exports to Iraq is increasing Persia 1 co J n E et ^ ors tbe i m P or t trade of Iraq are Japan, conn fat! and the United States of America, in that order. 4 No other imports mnsLH^ UCh ^ pe J Cent - of the total im P ort tr ade.

Ot this competition, as it affects the trade of the United Kinldom,have recently been furnished to the Foreign Office, and it is unnecessary to enter into details here. Fhe Lmted Kingdom manufactures chiefly affected are cotton textiles, where a fall of five points in the United Kingdom percentage of imports can safely be ascribed to increased Japanese competition. Unimportant as this loss may seem to be, it is sufficient on which to ground serious misgivings for the ^ture, since Japan's interest in the Iraq market has been hitherto incidental rather than deliberate. Of late, however, there have been clear indications that she intends to devote closer attention to Iraq, as shown by the establishment of direct communications by sea between Japan and Basra, and by the steps taken to secure return cargoes from Iraq for the Japanese vessels operating the service.

[E 1604/1038/93 No. 1. Sir F. Humphrys to Sir John Simon.—(Received March 12.) (No. 116.) Sir, Bagdad, March 1, 1934. I HAVE already reported in my telegram Nq^42 of the 21st February that a new Cabinet was formed by Jamil Beg Madfai on that date, owing to the fact that his colleagues in the former Cabinet were unable to compose their personal differences and agree to serve together. 2. The causes of dissension among the members of the previous Cabinet were not in themselves important, but have been exaggerated by mutual jealousies, which the young King was unable to appease. Rustam Haidar, the Minister of Economics and Communications and a Shia, who had been the subject of violent attacks in the press on the ground that he was of Syrian extraction and therefore a foreigner, had sought to improve his position in the country by coquetting mildly with the Shias of the Holy Places. His actions were magnified by Naji Shaukat, the Minister of Interior, into dangerougs intrigues wdiich aimed at self-aggrandisement. In addition to this, Rustam Haidar had wounded the vanity of the Minister of Finance by inviting tenders for the Kut Barrage scheme without consulting him. Nuri Pasha had summoned Jafar Pasha from London with the intention, it was believed, of putting him into the palace as King Ghazi’s principal adviser in the place of Ali Jaudat Beg, with a view to forming a Government composed of his own followers with palace support, when Jamil Madfai’s Cabinet resigned. Yasin Pasha, leader of the Opposition, was credited with the ambition of becoming Prime Minister, and forming a Cabinet exclusively from the Ikha party. In that event, it -was thought that he would secure the dissolution of Parliament and pack the new Chamber with his own supporters. A further cause of schism was found in the policy pursued by the Minister of Education, Saleh Beg Jabur, which was repugnant to the majority of his colleagues. He had, however, been the nominee of the Prime Minister, who felt unable, without loss of face, to replace him, except at the expense of some of his critics. 3. In these circumstances, the King was loath to run the risk of placing either Nuri Pasha or Yasin Pasha at the head of a Government formed on purely party lines, and succeeded in persuading Jamil Madfai to reconstitute his Cabinet from men who would consent to work with the present Parliament as a National Government. His Majesty also decided to show impartiality by leaving out Rustam Haidar and Saleh Beg Jabur. 4. The new Cabinet is composed entirely of ex-Cabinet Ministers, the majority of whom have colourless records. The brains and experience are chiefly centred in the volatile personality of Naji Pasha Suwaidi, Minister of Finance, who was Prime Minister in 1929. With the exception of Jamil Madfai, the only member of the previous Government who has resumed office is Jamal Baban, Minister of Justice. 5. The general verdict is that it is a weak Cabinet which can be trusted to work harmoniously and to carry out routine work satisfactorily, but is likely to succumb if faced by serious opposition in the Parliament. The programme which it has published, and which forms an enclosure to this despatch, contains nothing new or striking, but has been well received by the local press. Lnless Nnri Pasha and Yasin Pasha, who represent the driving force in the political life of Iraq, are content to remain out of office for a considerable time, I do not anticipate that the new Government will last more than a few months. [56 m—21fi r t is perhaps, noteworthy that in commenting on the programme of the new Government, Yasin Pasha urged that the time had now come for all parties ^ concentrate their whole attention on the country s commerce and finances, to concent ^ sendino . a copy of this despatch to His Majesty s Minister at Tehran and to the Department of Overseas Trade. ^ ^ &amp;c F. H. HUMPHRYS.’rN Enclosure in No. 1. Programme of the Second Madfai Cabinet. Speech by Prime Minister. OUR Cabinet depends on God and the confidence of His Majesty the King and that of Parliament. We have resolved to conduct the affairs of State in accordance with the principles contained in the programme of the previous Cabinet. That programme was made known to Parliament a few months ago. Nevertheless, the Cabinet wish to explain to you the more important objects underlying the principles in question :— Foreign Policy. To maintain the friendly and amicable relations existing between Iraq and other States, and to endeavour to strengthen these relations. To expand diplomatic representation in countries with which Iraq has political and economic relations, with a view to strengthening Iraq’s positions abroad and promoting her •economic interests. To enact the necessary legislation for regulating the conditions of service and determining the duties of officials of the diplomatic and consular service. To enquire into the settlement of subsidiary questions outstanding between Iraq and Great Britain, such as those concerning the port, railways and aerodrome guards. Domestic Policy. To maintain the peace and tranquillity now prevailing throughout the country; to increase the efficiency of the police force and complete the equipment of this force; to enquire into the establishment of new hospitals; to raise the standard of technical efficiency in health institutions; and to increase the number of dispensaries throughout the country. To complete the establishments of the Census Department. Financial Policy. To finance the State administration from normal receipts, and assign extraordinary receipts to the carrying out of major capital works; to establish a permanent cadre for State officials on sound bases, and to see that no expansion in establishments is carried out except in cases of unavoidable necessity; to improve and increase natural products, and exert all possible efforts for finding fresh and suitable markets for disposal of these products. Judicial A ffairs. To ensure fair administration of justice and the proper application of laws; ex P e d 1 te the enactment of necessary legislation, such as the draft Criminal and Cml 1 rocedure Laws, and the draft Law of Commerce, and to draw up bases for a civil code. Economic Policy. a 1°^ ^® ve ^ 0 P men f schemes already decided upon, such as the Gharraf ana Mabbaniyah schemes, the two projected bridges in Bagdad, and the Naqarrat ( wa ei a s 011 the Euphrates), and other necessary works; and to make the necessary anangements for the financing of these schemes and works and their early completionDefence A ffairs. .T-* measures for the enforcement of the army. ' ' ° Educational Affairs. ^ lo comoat miLeracy; to improve the curriculum of instruction; to expand primary and village schools as far as possible; and to adopt measures calculated to improve the qualifications of students for educational missions abroad. The Cabinet realises the serious nature of the obligations laid upon their shoulders, and are conscious of what the country expect from them. Thev will therefore exert theii utmost for the realisation of the hopes set on them and thev pray God to help them to succeed in their efforts. ’ J wjk of Statf; 1 s positi .s of senIn any further communication on this subject, please quote No. e: and address —not to any person by name, but to— The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1.

Humphrys to Sir John Simon.—(Received February 12.) (No. 67.) gii« 5 Bagdad, February 1, 1934. ’ THERE seems to be a tendency in some quarters in England to belittle the value of the special position which Great Britain has acquired in Iraq and to emphasise the risks which we are supposed to run in carrying out the provisions of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance concluded in 1930. These critics bewail the large sums of British money poured out in Iraq, which they state have produced no return to His Majesty’s Government, but a crop of expensive and hazardous commitments. They even suggest that the Assyrian troubles last August, the origin and nature of which they entirely fail to comprehend, should be followed by some fundamental change in our relations with the Iraqi Government. Finally, they claim that we should cut our losses and reduce our stake in the country to that of the other foreign Powers who are represented at Bagdad. It is true that, in the early days of the British occupation after the war, very large sums of money were spent on the maintenance of the British garrison in Iraq, ranging from £23 million in 1921-22 to £6 million in 1923-24. Since the military garrisons were replaced by the Royal Air Force on the recommenda tion of the Cairo Conference convened in 1921, there has been a progressive reduction in the charges which have been met by His Majesty’s Treasury, till the figure of £350,000 was reached last year! This figure represents the “additional” cost of locating Royal Air Force forces (with their ancillary services) in this country instead of in England, and is a charge which I believe is held to be justified by our strategic requirements in the Middle East, quite apart from the obligations of our alliance with Iraq. I shall endeavour in this despatch to indicate in some detail the economic benefits to Great Britain which seem to me to be derived from the Treaty of Alliance and the special position which His Majesty s Government have built up in Iraq. In appraising the value of future benefits, it should not be forgotten that the potential wealth of Iraq is by no means inconsiderable, in fact certain foreign observers, who have recently visited this country, estimate that when the mineral and agricultural resources of Iraq have been scientifically developed its material wealth will eventually exceed that of Egypt. 2. His Majesty’s Treasury has regularly received from the Iraqi Govern ment an annual cash payment in respect of amortisation of the capital debt ot the port of Basra. Up to the 1st April last the payments made on this account reached a total of £409,000. Twenty further annual ^payments are due to be made, of amounts progressively decreasing from £36,050 to £18,030, betore e debt is entirely liquidated. These sums represent a refund of essentia war- ime expenditure incurred in Iraq by His Majesty’s Government, and it is notewor y that the rate of interest charged on the capital amount is o per cent. It is interesting to compare the steady revenue derived by the Treasury on war accoun from Iraq with the uncompromising refusal of the Persian Governmen o acknowledge any form of war debt as due to Great Britain. am o opinion that Iraq would similarly repudiate her debt obligations if any serious diminution of British influence in this country should take place. , 3. Under the terms of the financial agreement attached to the treaty o 1930, a sum of approximately £350,000 is due to be pai ° Tj 7 • ^ x „ Treasury by the Iraqi Government when the evacuation of the Royal Air Force stations at Mosul and Hinaidi has been completed. 4. His Majesty’s Government are still the nominal owners of ^6 Uaqi railways; Their financial interest in them will be capRahsed at just over £2 million as, soon as a railway corporation has been set up to administer them T31 m—1]a orordins 1 to the asreement embodied in the Treaty of Alliance. It is true that this amount is to be represented by 6 per cent, preference shares which are to be non-cumulative, with very little hope of a dividend, for the first twenty years of the corporation’s existence, but the preponderating financial interest and the British control remain. Actual cash for the whole, or any part of this asset, mav not be realisable, but some tangible benefit in one way or another wi^ undoubtedly be secured from the Iraqi Government when they eventually acquire His Majesty’s Government’s interest in the railways. There are numerous advantages to British industry arising out of this dominant interest in the Iraqi railways which will be described later on in this despatch. 5 Letter No. 3, attached to the treaty of 1930, provides that “ the Iraq Government will normally engage British subjects when in need of the services of foreign officials.” There are 242 British officials in the employ of the Iraqi Government, including sixty-one in the railways and fifty-nine in the port of Basra and the Fao Bar Dredging Service, who annually receive not less than £250,000 in salaries. The rates of pay drawn by these officials are sufficiently generous to warrant the assumption that 25 per cent, of their emoluments, say, £60,000 annually, is remitted to England for expenditure or investment there. It is true that the numbers of these officials employed will gradually tend to decrease as the Iraqi becomes more and more qualified to take over the various technical and specialist posts now held by British subjects, but there are no signs at present of a landslide in this direction. 6. The Iraq (British Officials) Provident Fund receives annually about £60,000 in contributions from the Iraqi Government and the British officials. Practically the whole of this amount is remitted to the United Kingdom for investment, where it is eventually paid out to retirants from the fund. The fund itself is worth approximately £400,000, and has been built up in this way. The amounts paid out annually to retirants in the United Kingdom average £50,000. All these remittances represent fresh money flowing from Iraq into Great Britain to provide pensions for British subjects. 7. There are other economic benefits which accrue to the United Kingdom from this source. British officials are mainly employed in the technical and engineering departments of the Government and, when stores, machinery and other Government requirements have to be purchased abroad, their connexion with the Government usually results in orders being placed with British firms. With but few exceptions, the whole of the heavy material and equipment required for the Posts and Telegraphs Department, the port of Basra, the railways and the Irrigation and Public Works Department has been purchased in the United Kingdom. This process has, to some extent, been developed by the valuable association with the Crown Agents for the Colonies and by a growing realisation that British goods can be relied on for quality and durability. When municipalities launch out into public utility schemes, British industry usually reaps the advantage. I would mention, as two examples out of many, the electric power plants recently purchased for the Basra and Mosul municipalities at a cost of £60,000 and £45,000 respectively. I have not before me figures showing 4 ? e n Va ^ Ue or( ^ ers which have been placed with British firms on behalf °r hrovernment Departments and public bodies, but I estimate that the business thereby falling to Great Britain has not been less than £200,000 annually. It is practically certain that, if the Iraqi Government employed foreign experts of a nationality other than British, this business would have gone elsewhere. In he future, as the number of British officials tends to decrease, greater responsibility will devolve on the Embassy and consulates, especially on the commercial secretary, to assist British firms to overcome the foreign competition w ic will undoubtedly develop as the spending power of the country increases. . Under article 6 of the annexure to the Treaty of Alliance, the Iraqi overnment are bound to ensure that the armament and essential equipment of the Iraqi army and air force shall not differ in type from those of the Imperial hun C nno aiS ° u Govern p ent employ a mission of British officers at a cost of . t0 , a n dvise them on militar y matters. Although it is not f n ? ed that warlike material and equipment shall be purchased T? n ’ • ^ Wld n ? rmall y h a PPen so long as the British military mission A • j? ' or ias l' ance , the whole of the aircraft required for the Royal Iraqi Britich r fir^ m0 Tu tmg ^twenty-seven machines to date, has been ordered from e maintenance of strong and well-equipped land and air forcesMical i iineriffli is part of the programme of all political parties in Iraq, and Parliament will probably be asked to sanction expenditure to the amount of £500,000 on military equipment in the near future. British firms should receive practically the whole of these orders. 9. The Iraqi Government have prudently decided that the share of the •■receipts from the exploitation of their oil resources shall be segregated from general revenues and shall be devoted to expenditure on productive capital works. The minimum sum receivable from this source is £400,000 “ gold,” rising to a guaranteed minimum of £600.000 ‘' gold 5 ’ when oil goes to production, probably in 1935. There are certain advances repayable to the company from these royalties in the first two or three years of production, but from 1937-38 onwards , the net annual amount receivable from oil is estimated at not less than 1 million A sterling. Foremost among the development schemes at present contemplated are' the Habbaniyah Escape and Kut Barrage projects, each estimated to cost about £1,100,000. The contract for Habbaniyah will probably be given to a British firm in the near future, and it is anticipated that between £350,000 and £400,000 will be spent abroad upon the purchase of plant and materials for this undertaking. Other large orders should be forthcoming within the next few years and, if proper diligence is observed, British firms stand a reasonable chance of securing a large proportion of them. If the strength of the British connexion is allowed to wane, several million pounds’ worth of business of this category might easily slip into foreign hands. 10. In addition to the programme of national capital works, heavy- expenditure is bound to be incurred on extending and reconditioning the Iraqi railways. A railway bridge at Bagdad and an extension of the line to Mosul are urgent necessities, which must be carried out during the next few years. The estimated combined cost of these works is £1 million, of which approximately one-third will be spent upon the purchase of imported materials. It is probable that the whole of this business will go to the United Kingdom. 11. A detailed survey of a railway from Bagdad to Haifa is nearing completion, and the estimates are expected to reach a figure of about £8 million. The whole of the equipment and materials required for this railway, costing roughly between £2-^ and £3 million, will probably be purchased in the L nited Kingdom if the project meets with the approval of the British and Iraqi Governments. . .. 12. The Fao Bar has been dredged, and a channel, navigable by heavily loaded tankers, drawing up to 30 feet, has been forced through the accumulation of silt at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab. The whole of the dredging equipment for this work, at a cost of £290.000, was purchased in Great Britain. A third dredger, costing approximately £120,000, is about to be ordered. It is true that the capital cost of this important work was originally financed by the Ang o- Persian Oil Company, and that the dues from which the debt is being amortised are mostly paid bv the tankers of the company, but the company ha^e a iea &gt; received their money 7 back with interest at 6 per cent, per annum, they wi probably agree that it was a remunerative investment, as they have sa\ed mi J 01 ^ 5, of pounds by being able to dispense with the costly alternative of lightering eir tankers over the bar. The Fao Bar Dredging Service, in which the prosperi y of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is deeply concerned, is, for all practical purposes, a British institution. * i t 13. I think that the preceding paragraphs will show that the Angio-lraqi Alliance has already proved economically valuable to Great Britain, and a British industry should continue to derive advantage from economic developments in Iraq. I will now refer brieflv to the present predominance of Great Britain in the commerce of Iraq. During the past three years the total imports into Iraq, and the British share thereof, were as follows : Total imports Imports from United Kingdom United Kingdom per centage [31 m—1] 1930-31. 1931-32. 1932-33. £ £ £ 5.355,000 4,800.000 6,240,000 1,665,000 1.305,000 2,179,000 31-10% 2719% 34-92% B 2■ mmm The above figures are taken from official Iraqi sources. It is interesting to compare them with the value of the British exports to Turkey and Persia over the same period:- 1930-31. 1931-32. Iraq Turkey Persia £ 1.665.000 1.868.000 2,695,000 £ 1.305.000 1.715.000 727,000 1932-33. £ 2.179.000 1.484.000 827,000 Thus Iraq with 3 million inhabitants, took last year very nearly as much in British eoods as Persia and Turkey, with 24 million inhabitants, combined. While the volume of British exports to Turkey and Peisia is steadily diminishing, the flow of British goods into Iraq is steadily maintained. Iraq is one of the very few countries whose commerce shows a steady balance of trade in favour of the United Kingdom. In 1932-33 Iraq imported from the United Kingdom anods to the value of £1,221,000 more than she exported to the United Kingdom. &amp; 14 Numerous other comparisons of a similar nature could be drawn to demonstrate that Iraq, for her size, is an excellent customer. There is no reason to apprehend that British trade will diminish to any marked extent, as long as the privileged position in Iraq, secured to Great Britain by the Treaty of Alliance, is maintained. Iraq places no hampering restrictions on imports, and has no trade quota, no discriminatory tariffs, and no exchange difficulties or restrictions; her currency is linked to sterling, which in itself greatly facilitates commercial relationships with Great Britain. 15. Great Britain is deeply interested in the exploitation and development of the oil-fields of Iraq. At the present time Iraq’s requirements of petrol, kerosene and oil are supplied almost entirely from the wells in the transferred territories on the Persian border, which are operated by a British subsidiary of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The requirements which are not obtained from this source come from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s wells in Persia. The distributing company, which employs about forty Englishmen in Iraq itself, has a virtual and very valuable monopoly of the sale of oil products in Iraq. The operation and development of the rich oil-bearing area round about Kirkuk is in the hands of the Iraq Petroleum Company, which is nominally one-fourth British, but is under British direction. The work involved in drilling and testing the area has cost approximately £3^ million, and has given employ ment to a large number of people, many of whom, apart from the actual drillers, have been British subjects. The work on the construction of the pipe-line, the pumping stations and other works preparatory to bringing the wells to production will involve the expenditure of many more millions. Many British subjects are employed on these works. British firms have received a large proportion of orders for materials, and contracts have been placed in the United Kingdom for the supply of pipes, heavy transport, pumping engines, to the value of at least ^nnlhon. The economic value to Palestine of an oil terminus at the port of Haifa^ built by a loan guaranteed by His Majesty’s Government, is considerable. The routing of the main channel of the pipe-line to Haifa, by t ^ 11S ^U^een made possible, was ensured by the influence of the Anglo-Iraqi lance. When the company reaches the productive stage, with its pumping stations and water wells spaced over the Syrian desert and the wastes of i ransJordan, British personnel will be required in appreciable numbers to man in^raq 11 ^° S S ’ m ac ^ 1 ^ 10n those needed to carry out the work of the company n -i 1 ^ he 1 onl y ot her concession in the oil-bearing area has been given to the British hp^ iw c f m 5 nt C ° m fi any ’ a Britl sh registered company.

The greater part of the country's foreign trade is carried in British ships. The foreign capital sunk in the country is almost exclusively British. Two out of the three banks are entirely British, including the Eastern Bank, which handles all the Government cash; the capital of the third bank, the Ottoman, is -about one- ^ird British and has a number of British directors. All important insurance business is in the hands of British firms. In another sphere of activity, the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company is a long-established British Company, linked to the British India Steamship Company, operating, with but one native competitor, river transport on the River Tigris between Basra and Bagdad. It owns a fleet of eighteen steamers and has about £250,000 invested in Iraq. In every direction, despite the intense Japanese competition, British X commercial influence remains paramount. Iraq is in a good position to take advantage of the economic revival, of the imminence of which there are signs. There is money waiting to be spent and large orders to be taken, and there is a good prospect of British interests reaping substantial benefit from these developments. 17. This despatch is primarily concerned with the economic advantages which accrue to Great Britain from the special connexion which we maintain with Iraq under the terms of the 1930 Treaty of Alliance. There are also obvious strategic advantages. The important waterway of the Shatt-el-Arab, no less than the Persian Gulf, is virtually controlled by British seamen, and is free of all restrictions for the use of the ships of His Majesty's navy. Our alliance with Iraq provides a guarantee for the security of the Anglo-Persian oil-fields. The ships of His Majesty's navy will doubtless obtain the bulk of their fuel in future at the convenient port of Haifa, from what is, perhaps, the richest oil-field in the world, whose head works, pumping stations and pipe-line are situated within the orbit of the control of the Royal Air Force. Finally, for a length of 700 miles, Iraq forms a vital link in the chain of our Imperial communications by air which we cannot afford to leave unprotected. We have sunk millions in this country in less propitious times and are just beginning to obtain a return on our expenditure. It is not a question of throwing good money after bad, but of consolidating, at a relatively trifling cost, a hard-won position of pre-eminence on one of the world's important highways. I am confident that any panicky proposals for drastic treaty revision or “ scuttle ” will receive short shrift at the hands of His Majesty’s Government. It is generally admitted that Iraq cannot stand on its own legs without the assistance of a great Power for many years to come. We have undertaken to provide this assistance for twenty-five years, and in the process, if we use our opportunities aright, we should be able to reap valuable material benefits to which British sacrifices in blood and treasure have given us an unassailable title. There are others both ready and eager to take our place if we pusillanimously abandon our trust. I have, &amp;c. F. H.

WITH reference to my telegram No , 451 of the 9th November, I have the honour to inform you that the new Cabinet formed by Jamil Beg-al-Madfai faced the Chamber for the first time on the 1st November. The omission of Yasin Pasha from the Cabinet is, in my opinion, not so significant as it might appear at first sight to be. The reason for the resignation of the late Prime Minister, Rashid Ali Beg, was the refusal of King Ghazi to dissolve Parliament, and Yasin Pasha informed me that he felt bound in honour to Rashid Ali, rather than to personal conviction, to decline to form a new Government or, indeed, to become a member of it, unless the King gave way on this point. Yasin Pasha assures me, however, that he does not intend to embarrass the young King by opposing the new Govern ment in Parliament, and that he hopes io be of some service to King Ghazi and his country by giving advice behind the scenes when asked to do so. Possibly his intention is to join the Cabinet later or to accept the premiership after a decent interval in case the present Government fails to retain His Majesty’s confidence, remembering that in normal circumstances the life of an Iraqi Cabinet does not last more than a few months. 2. The session opened with the first reading of the National Service Law, which was received with acclamation. Then followed the election of a president to fill the vacancy created by Jamil Beg’s appointment to the premiership. The choice of the Chamber fell upon Rashid Beg-al-Khoja, formerly Iraqi consul- general at Beirut. He was the Government candidate and his election by sixty-six votes out of the seventy-three cast may be taken as a vote of confidence in the new Cabinet. 3. After the election of the president the Prime Minister made a statement on the policy of the new Government, the full text of which forms an enclosure to this despatch. This vague mixture of platitudes and pious hopes sheds very little light on the principles which will guide the Cabinet in governing and administer ing the country, but I think that it may be assumed that, in its main lines, their policy will differ very little from that of the last Cabinet. 4. At the close of the meeting the president read out a Royal iradah proroguing Parliament for a period of thirty days. 5. The National Service Law mentioned in paragraph 2 above will form the subject of a subsequent despatch. I have, &amp;c. E. H. HUMPHRYS. Enclosure in No. 1. Translation of Speech delivered by the Prime Minister in the Chamber of Deputies on November 12, 1933. DEPENDING on assistance from the Almighty and on the valuable confidence placed in it by His Majesty the King, our Cabinet ventured upon assuming the burden of government, realising the importance of the responsibility placed on its shoulders and resolved to lead the country forward on the road to power and advancement. . . Gentlemen! The object of this Cabinet in regard to foreign policy is to maintain the relations of amity and friendship obtaining between this State and other States, and to endeavour to strengthen and fortify these relations on the basis of an exchange of benefits. [963 dd—2] Ui^lontfrighUsTsaored thingT^d the carrying out of our obligations towards Fhe society in which we live is a vital necessity. To urge the discharge o^ tne society in develop the civil conscience of the nation by instilling* respect'for Idie^provisions of the P Constitution and for democratic traditions to „v^d biased proceedings prejudicial to the public interest these are among the moslfimportantUjects of the^ Cabinet. The nation’s need for these matters is a nressinc?one and the Cabinet is intent on securing them by all possible means P Former’Cabinets presented to you many detailed programmes m which reference was made to the necessity of ensuring justice of lending attention to health and educational affairs, of strengthening national defence, of expanding agriculture and irrigation, of mitigating the effects of the economic crisis, of developing the country’s economic resources, &amp;c. There is no difference of opinion over these matters as being essential constituents of national existence, and as being most needed by Iraq of all nations. It is equally essential, m our opinion, so to dispose of the' moral and material forces of the country as to ensure the quickest and least costly exploitation thereof. _ During the last ten vears this country made considerable progress. Bearing in mind that we are still in an early stage of reconstruction, we should double our efforts in the service of our beloved country. ,. . The Government will exert themselves to the utmost tor the realisation ot those obiects and for the development of the country with the greatest possible expedition. Detailed plans will be disclosed later on, when they are laid before ^ Upon assuming the burden of responsibility, the Cabinet held before itself for guidance the last words of the great departed one and founder of this nation, in which he urged the nation to be strong and united. In fact, unity is the foundation of strength; it demands co-operation and collaboration between the Government and the various classes of the people. With this principle in view, the Cabinet introduces itself to the whole nation, seeking support in its endeavours for the revival of the nation’s old glories and for the enhancement of its position.

Enclosure in No. 1. Translation of Speech from the Throne, read by King Ghazi, on the opening of the Parliamentary Session on November 1, 1933. AS we stand before you this moment with the help of God to open your distinguished Assembly, there rises before us the painful memory of the founder of this State and builder of its glory, my late father and father of the whole nation, whom may God envelope with His mercy and receive into His heavenly paradise. He left us after a long and continuous struggle, during which he spared neither health nor comfort in the service of this beloved home-land. He died a martyr to duty, bequeathing to us, in the history of his life, which was full of big achievements and great hopes, a high ideal and a source, from which we may draw energy and strength for the realisation of what was his aspiration, and, following in his step, may always proceed forward with our beloved nation. He received the summons of his Lord with a mind well satisfied, commanding us to be united and strong. He will face the Almighty God with a peaceful conscience. Gentlemen, i Our relations with the various States are proceeding on a basis of good understanding and amity. The development and strengthening of these relations is one of our most special aspirations. The last visit which the one of whom the nation has been bereaved paid to His Majesty King George the Fifth, and the demonstrations of mutual friendship and amity which characterised that visit, have had the happiest effect in the strengthening of the bonds of friendship between the peoples of the two allied States. Similarly, the result of the work of the two ministerial delegations to London and Geneva are such as gives cause for satisfaction. Some of the Assyrians misunderstanding the objects of our Government brought about a rebellion, which compelled our Government to take disciplinary action against them. The great vigilance which the people exercised during that unfortunate incident has no doubt given a most effective lesson to those who may contemplate prejudicing the peace and unity of this country. The endeavours exerted by our delegation at Geneva in regard to the removal from Iraq of these dissatisfied Assyrians have borne fruit, and it is confidently hoped that arrangements for the execution of this project will be completed at an early date. [963 n—1](l Peace’and tranquillity prevail throughout the whole Kingdom, thanks to Pod Upon its formation the new Cabinet will put up its programme. We have no doubt that all realise the importance of the present circumstances and that every one is doing all that is in his power for the enhancement of the country’s position and for raising it to a befitting place among the nations of the world. ^ ' We pray the Almighty God to lead your steps into the right path and to grant you success in all your endeavours., __ ©OV£.F?iNO LET Tfc; ^ '' A T Pf This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] Decypher S-lP F 0 Kumphrys (Bagdad) c 9th November, 1933, D 0 1»25 p a rn. ? 9th November, 1933 H 0 1 0 20 p 0 m t , 9th November , 193 Iiuiaedi.ate My telegram No 0 437 I saw the King last night and His Majesty told me Pasha hao. definitely declined to form a new Government unless Parliament wa,s dissolved immediately and unless he was given unfettered discretion in choice Oj. nis col leagues.

Amman, 26 th September, 1933 lo. 210 /7/Sec. Your Excellency, I have the honour to report that I had a talk yesterday with His Highness the Amir regarding affairs in the Iraq and the effect of King Feisal T s death on the Arab world in general. 2. His Highness T s immediate reaction on the receipt of the news of King Feisal’s death had been to indicate his intention of taking his deceased brother T s place as the acknowledged leader of the Arab nationalists of Iraq, Syria, Trans-Jordan and Palestine. His Highness T sfirst step in that direction was a reconciliation with the members of the Istiqlal party with whom he had been in open opposition immediately previously. Following this reconciliation, Adil el Azmeh from Trans-Jordan and Auni Abdul Hadi and Izzet Darwazi from Palestine travelled to the Iraq as members of His Highness f s suite. 3. I know that it had been His Highness f s hope that there would he a general discussion at Bagdad of political questions of interest to the Arab countries hut I gathered yesterday that any such discussion failed to materialize and that the Iraqi politicians had been too concerned for the moment with the local reactions to King reisal's death to interest themselves in the affairs of o.djc.cent nrab countries. 4 . ' '’1Sb^TIN 6 HIGH COMMISSIONER TOR TRAhl-J KtDah JEHJSALM.4. His Highness was at pains to impress upon me the trouble he had taken to induce his nephew King Ghazi and the Iraqi ministers to follow a policy of friendship and understanding with Great Britain, not only in matters concerning the Iraq but also in matters concerning the question nearest to the heart of all Arab patriots, that is to say the union of Iraq, Syria, Palestine and Trans- Jordan. His Highness said that he had received a pressing invitation from the Iraqi ministers to visit the Iraq at frequent intervals in order to give the new King the benefit of his advice. His Highness’s reply, according to his own report, was to the effect that he could only accept the invitation if encouraged to do so by His Majesty Government. 5. I saw King Ali later in day and he spoke to me at some length on the necessity of the Anglo-Arab co-operation in the Iraq in particular and in the Near East in general. King Ali informed me that he had obtained solemn promises from all political leaders in the Iraq to give their support to King Ghazi and to abstain from inter party strife at least until after he. King Ali, returned from Europe when he would be able to advise the young King* 6 . I am informed reliably that the Istiqlal party have not really decided whether to tame ning Gnazi as their new leader in his father’s stead or to encourage the claims of His Highness to irab leadership. They hope that a more definite lead will be forthcoming no:-i the irc^i politicians after the memorial service for King Feisal inch will take place forty days after the late Ling's death.

OF A,l. Hy little son, may God support and s&amp;to him. I hid you farewell and leave you to the ears of God who never fails those who seek refuge in Him. I leave you to God’s might and force. I advice you to bo obedient to Him and to serve Him. I desire to send to you a note before I leave to my country. This note I believe will draw your attention to many important points. 1. How, my little* oon, you have succeeded a man, who is not like other men. You are the successor to the founder of ’Iraq, the corner stone of the country, the possessor of the hearts of the Syrians, the son to the chieftain of the Arab Revolution. You have succeeded a man, who filled heart® with homage, respect and admiration. You have succeeded a human being, who never wearied to work for his nation; patient, thoughtful, successful and lucky in men, Arabs and non-Arabs. Thus, my little son, you must work to fill his place and occupy the seat he accessed; and that is winning public confidence. It is not an easy matter. It is not also difficult when you doclde and never give up. 2. My little son, by the gift of God, you are the King of ’Iraq. You saw the fruits of your successful father’s hard work. You have only to follow his foot-steps and plans. He left to you sincere men and friends who are ever useful to you. They are competent men, to accompli ah deeds entrusted to them. Your father trained them in all ways. Keep these men. 3. Sir, you have two difficulties to meet: home-policy and foreign-policy. You have got to make your plans for both policies, after studying them. You must stick to . your plane and never allow yourself to be distracted ^ from the main goal. You are in ’Iraq and in ’Iraq there- 2 - an parties which inherited their tendeneiee through ages. It is not difficult to subdue the obstacles. Be A t0 aU * and never b « to one alone. Let every one i&gt;.ve a share in you and be the center of their hopes. You must give importance to sects and keep their balance. You must not bias with or against any. Put the law before your eyes and observe your deeds carefully and watchfully and let those responsible to give an account of what they are doing. 4. I only f^ar at the present party conflicts. And I see uhat it is a duty of the ^raq people to keep quiet until you have had time to study the conditions of the country, understand its needs and desires, get sufficient experience in solving difficulties with a strong hand and a trained mind. I see, that you should not dissolve the House of Commons, under all conditions, lest the necessity of re-election should arise and you would have to meet party conflicts. I hope that the present loyal government would he able to serve you and your people when it finds confidence and determination in you. Take care of the Euphrates Valley and respect its chiefs and let them be yours, for still they are of power and might. Respect the tribes and their chiefs for they are the origin of Arabs; they are obliging and useful. Keep the Hedjazi people who found refuge in your father in their crisis and migration. Bo to them, as your father was to them always, 5. The problem of the Assyrians has passed through its acute stage and only its results in the League of Nations trouble you still. I hop© that it would be solved in accordance with interests. I advise you to solve similar problems peacefully and through lapse of time and you should avoid their recurrences. The problem of Shoea and Sunna, though of impor- HHt&amp;nee, is an aid and familiar question, which can be eolvod in any way. The only danger lies in sects and parties. Always keep watch of these two points. 6. As regards foreign policy. You must know, my little sen, that when the Arabs decided to separate from the Turks, under the leadership of your grand-father, they found that it was necessary to strengthen their forces with the force of an ally. It was the will of God that that ally should be Great Britain. She helped your grand-father in the wars ef the Revolutien said yeur father in the foundation ef ’Iraq. She took your uncle by the hand in the establishment of Trans-Jordania. She is yeur ally today and you ay dear, are not in need ef being stirred te support this alliance and strengthen the bonds of friendship between you and this power, Great Britain, you must also keep friendly relations with all ether powers and nations. I bog you te seek always the advise of His Excellency the British Ambassador, your father’s friend personally, in your affairs, seeking the advise of friends is always useful. Then you are free and it is in yeur power te make yeur decision. Hover think that British Interests are contradictory to what she has founded in 1 Iras together with yeur father. Thus interests are mutual and mutual help in the duty of both parties. Hover be hasty. There is another point of importance and that is your attitude towards your uncle, His H&amp;ehimite Majesty King All who is to stand by you. He is our master. Whenever you are entangled in an interne! or foreign difficulty be directed by his guidance. All good and w* 11 -fare lie In him.

I immediately called on the Prime Minister and expressed to his Excellency the condolences of His Majesty’s Government and my own personal sorrow for the death of King Feisal, and my sympathy wuth Iraq at the tragic loss which she had suffered by this melancholy event. His Excellency thanked me for my words and was good enough to say that the knowledge of the sympathy and support of His Majesty’s Government was a great source of comfort to him and his colleagues in their grief and bereavement. He then asked Yasin Pasha to join us, and they discussed with me briefly the action which was necessary in view of the King’s death. I advised swift compliance with the provisions of the Organic Law. They agreed and said that arrangements would be made for proclaiming the accession of the Amir Ghazi before the general public were aware of King Feisal’s death. They also consulted me about the position of the Cabinet, I said that under their Constitution the Cabinet should resign, and I hoped that they would be reappointed by the new King immediately, without change, as in times of excite ment it was important to preserve continuity. The Ministers also sought m\ advice on several small 'protocolaire questions, and before I took my leave both of them offered me the most solemn, and, I believe, sincere assurances that the Government were resolved, as a duty to the memory of the late King, to maintain the closest and most friendly relations with Great Britain, and to seek the ad’v ice and assistance of His Majesty s representatives on all important matters ; concerning the future of Iraq and the mutual interests of the two countries.

[907 t—H11th September, in the presence of a special session of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, King Ghazi again took the prescribed oath of loyalty to the Organic Law, and the constitutional formalities of his accession were thereby completed 5. The death of King Feisal has naturally come as a great shock to everyone in Iraq, and the processions of mourners which have daily thronged the streets of Bagdad since the news of his demise was received testify to the grief which his passing has stirred in the hearts of the people. In political circles wher^' his shortcomings were realised and often severely criticised, his death has brought with it a keener appreciation of the great work which he accomplished, and a fresh proof of the old adage that water is not rightly valued until the well runs dry. It is realised that King Feisal’s death has left a gap in the political life of the country which will never, perhaps, be filled. It was he who founded the Iraq State and who guided it through the many perplexing difficulties which have been encountered during the twelve years of his reign, and those whom he has left to carry on his work are beginning to appreciate more fully the great burden of heavy responsibility which he bore. It was King Feisal’s skill and political subtlety which enabled him to hold the delicate balance between Sunni and Shiah and through his profound understanding of the Arab mind he was able to deal with his turbulent tribal chieftains with a marked degree of success The new King has neither the training nor the experience to fit him to continue this work and there is, I fear, a danger that a Government in which a Sunni Effendi element is always likely to predominate may fail through want of sympathetic understanding either to conciliate the Shiahs or to control the sheikhs as success fully as the late King. In internal political circles the loss of his guiding hand will also be acutely felt. In spite of the faults inherent in his highly-strung and imaginative temperament, his noble birth and his romantic leadership of the Arab cause placed nim in an exalted position which commanded respect; a position above the local party rivalries and personal jealousies of the country from which he could and did, m a very great measure, rule as well as reign. His successor f n r kp 0me yea ^ S an y rat T w ] n *? ave t0 P^y a less influential role, and it remains to be seen whether, deprived of King Feisal’s control, the governing class will have the wisdom to subordinate party feeling to the interests of the cSuntry. r a fi 18 Ma J est y s death will also bring about a big change in the nosition fao S W Lt”* ^ Iraqi HitLto B^ti^epksenU all matters cnt&lt;hrlp’tif 1 6 ma i n ’ exercis ®d their influence on the Government, in iilte“course with f-° pe ° f T° rl ? al relat , 10ns &gt; through friendly and confidential relations with the fV 11 ^ utule they will have to rely on more direct either bv netnasinnT nment ’ 811106 14 ,S Unlikel y that Kin g G haz i will be able.

HUMPHRYS. Enclosure in No. 1 . Extract from the Iraq Times of March 9 , 1933. THE new Iraq Parliament was formally opened yesterday mornino’ by His Majesty King Eeisal, amidst scenes of great enthusiasm. The galleries of the Chamber of Deputies were crowded. There was a large attendance of Iraqi and British military officers and civilian officials. The British Ambassador and all other members of the diplomatic and consular corps attended the ceremony. The scene inside the Chamber was picturesque. Some of the Deputies looked extremely modern in well-cut morning dress, but many more w r ere attired in Arab or Kurdish costume. The hats worn were extremely varied : they ranged from sidaras to agals and kaffiyahs, from the green and white turbans of the mullahs and saiyids to the tall hats of the latest arrivals from London and the continent. His Majesty arrived at the Chamber at 10 o’clock, accompanied by the Amir Ghazi and an entourage of Court officials. At the entrance of Parliament House he was met by the Prime Minister and other members of the Cabinet. The guard of honour gave the salute, and the Iraq army band played the national anthem. The Master of Ceremonies, Tahsin Qadri Beg, formally announced the arrival of His Majesty to the Senators and Deputies. The King's Speech. King Feisal then went to the President’s chair and delivered his Speech from the Throne, of which the following is a translation : — “ In the name of Almighty God we open this session of Parliament and wish you happy results from your deliberations. £t The new era which has come upon the country, as a result of our admission into the League of Nations and our attainment of complete independence, has increased your responsibilities, and you must ever bear this in mind. “ A new Cabinet was formed, and elections were then held to ascertain the wishes of the people as regards the statement of policy which was issued [739 u— 1 ]bv the new Government. The result was that the nation gave the members assembled here its confidence, and we hope that you will prove worthy of the nation’s trust^en it is &amp; source of gre at satisfaction to us to be able to say tw our relations with foreign countries—and especially’ with those who are our^neighbours—are very cordial. Our Government is doing its best to strengthen the ties of friendship with them. ‘‘We have welcomed with the greatest pleasure the invitation extended to us by His Majesty King George to visit His Majesty next summer This invitation which is the result of the conclusion of a treaty of alliance between our two countries, is another proof of the bonds of friendship which unite us. “ Although our relations with Persia are very cordial, they have been formally set forth only in a temporary treaty which was concluded on the 11th August 1929, and subsequently prolonged for a further period of six months ° As both nations wish to have a more permanent form of treaty, negotiations are expected to begin shortly between our diplomatic representa tives for the conclusion of a treaty, which is really essential to the interests of both nations. We have complete confidence that the negotiations will result in a satisfactory agreement and complete understanding between us “ The new status attained by our country when it became independent made it necessary that we should increase our diplomatic representation abroad, and our Government is doing its best to effect such an increase so far as its financial resources permit. . ^ t£ The economic crisis which is being experienced throughout the world has affected our country, but fortunately we are not suffering so severely as others. We are glad to be able to say that there are signs of an improvement in the near future The Government is trying to submit to Parliament a balanced budget. . £ ‘ You all know the law for the five-year construction plan, which was passed in 1931. Among the important schemes included in this plan was the Habbaniyah escape, the tenders for which are now being examined. It is also intended to carry out the Gharraf scheme. The Government now intends to revise the five-year law with a view to including in the programme some important projects such as the Yagara, the Qizil Itobat, and the Ishaki schemes. ££ One of the most important questions which will be studied by the Government is the strengthening of the army. I have no doubt that you will give this question your serious attention when it is submitted to you. ££ The Government is doing its best to improve the state of education, administration, and justice throughout the land, and we hope that you will give Ministers all the assistance in your power to forward these important ends. We are confident that you will examine such problems wdth wisdom and foresight. In conclusion, we wish that all your endeavours will be crowned with success.” At the close of the Speech from the Throne there was loud applause, and His Majesty then left the Chamber accompanied by the Amir Ghazi and the Court officials. The Senators left the Chamber to hold their own meeting. The Deputies were then called upon to take the oath. The election of the President of the new Chamber followed. Of eight-four Deputies who attended the session, seventy-two voted for his Excellency Jamil Beg A1 Midfai (the previous President), who was thereupon declared re-elected. Salman Beg Barrak was re-elected Vice-President. The Chamber of Deputies then adjourned until Saturday.Tn any further communication on this subject, please quote no.

(No. 181.) gjr, Bagdad, March 22 , 1933. ’ WITH reference to my telegram No. 50 of the 20th March, I have the honour to report the following further developments in the political situation in Iraq. 2. On the morning of the 17th March the Bagdad press published reports of a debate in the Chamber on the reply to the Speech from the Throne, which had taken place on the previous day. From these I observed that Yasin Pasha and others had made speeches in which they had urged the Government to endeavour to obtain a revision of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930. I enclose a summary^) of the debate, compiled from newspaper reports, from which it will be seen that the treaty was criticised as unjust and oppressive by reason of the immense burden of debt which it laid on the shoulders of Iraq, and the foreign forces and advisers which it imposed on the country. 3 . Knowing the King’s intention to form a new Cabinet and to appoint Yasin Pasha as Minister for Finance, I felt it necessary to warn him of the significance which would naturally be attached to such a change after this debate. I therefore sought and obtained an immediate audience with His Majesty. The following paragraphs summarise the main features of our conversation, which lasted for more than three hours :— 4 I opened my remarks by recalling that in the several previous discussions which we had recently had on the subject of His Majesty’s wish to foim a new Cabinet he had met my misgivings regarding the inclusion of Yasm Pasha by assuring me that the latter ’s hostility to the Treaty of Alliance of 1930 had- arisen solely from his personal differences with Nuri Pasha, and was not inspired by any real objection to the principles or provisions of the treaty per se His Majesty had asked me to believe that these personal differences were a thing ot the past and that no one in public life had now the least desire to alter the bases on which Anglo-Iraqi relations had been established by the treaty. 5. It had come, therefore, as a great surprise to me to see that, m e debate on the Speech from the Throne, Yasin Pasha and several of his asspciates had pressed the Government to seek an opportunity to amend the treaty, which they had frankly described as oppressive and unjust and mconsis en w independence. I added that I felt it necessary to warn His Majesty ‘hapf aftei such a debate, Naji Beg's Cabinet were to resign and a new Cabmy were formed including Yasin Pasha, and others known to be largely under Ms inflimnce th conclusion which would naturally and logically be rawn } (' 0 v e rinnCTit Government and by the outside world was that ,e g indicated a change ^ Pf g s “d^ G ^thrthat the reports which I had seen of what S Pa^ha had Jid in he Chamber the were possibly not altogether correct, and he produced a copy TSf'n’of a Ikha-al-Watani, in which the report of Tasin s speec .i- njmer was demand for the amendment of the treaty, and suggested that as this paper was t™official oreLi of the partv of which Yasin Pasha was the leader, its version tne omcrai oigan or uie par y |l t ic I demonstrated the weakness or ot his speech should be “^Xins that Yasin Pasha's strictures on the treaty this argument by showing ^ ^JAh two 0 f whose editors were themselves had been published m all other Mwspape Moreovel . the Prime Minister, Deputies and had been present g d f ded the attitude of his Government u - - -&gt;■«- (')Not printed. [767 0 —1]2 r&gt; whatever his exact words might have been he was still speaking as a member of the Opposition, and it was well understood in Iraq that no politician was obliged to apply when in office, the principles which he had advocated when in Opposition. If Yasin Pasha came into the new Cabinet he would discard his hostility to the treaty like an old coat. He had given the most solemn undertakings to work in harmony with his new colleagues, and if he broke his word he would be discredited and would have to go. At all events he would only be one amongst eight, and would have to conform to the wishes of the Prime Minister and the other Ministers. Moreover, foreign relations would be in the hands of Nuri Pasha, the very man who had concluded the treaty of 1930. Surely this fact was sufficient to demonstrate that the new Government, in all that concerned Iraq's relations with His Majesty’s Government and with other foreign countries, would follow the same policy as that of the Governments of Nuri Pasha and Naji Shaukat. 7 . His Majesty referred to my remark that the resignation of the Prime Minister following on the recent debate in the Chamber and the coming into office of a new Cabinet, composed largely of men who persisted in their opposition to the 1930 treaty, could not fail to create perplexity in British official circles. He asked me to convey to my Government the most emphatic assurance that these strange happenings implied no change whatsoever in policy towards Great Britain, and he begged me to emphasise that no importance should be attached to the opinions voiced by Yasin Pasha and others in regard to the treaty, since in Iraq men always changed their views when they came into office and assumed real responsibility. 8 . At this stage the King suggested that Nuri Pasha should join us, as he would be the man with whom I should have to deal when the new Cabinet was formed. Nuri Pasha then came in and remained with us for the rest of the interview. Prompted by the King he supported His Majesty's view that what Yasin Pasha said before he became a Minister was of no consequence, but admitted that if he were to criticise the treaty while in office it would be a different matter. I said that though these argments had a superficial plausibility, they were at bottom entirely specious and, moreover, presented a picture of public life in Iraq which was both ridiculous and degrading. Was I to report to my Govern ment that Iraq's public men, men who had held the highest positions in the State, made speeches on solemn occasions in which they voiced opinions which they knew to be false and meaningless ? Was I to say that the Iraqi Parliament was just a sham, a place where time and money was wasted by a handful of men, who, wnile masquerading as statesmen, neither meant what they said nor said what they believed ? If words were treated as lightly as this in Iraq, what value could be given to those solemn assurances and promises to which His Majesty attached so much importance ? His Majesty had done me the honour to consult me about nis pians for reorganising the Cabinet, and I had warned him of two dangers. One was that of damaging his good relations with Great Britain, and the other that of embarrassing the smooth working of the Government of his country by endeavouring to combine in the Cabinet elements which were essentially hostile and antipathetic to each other. In thus warning him I was not in the least conceined with personalities, but solely with the policy of the Iraqi Government, and subsequent events had only served to strengthen my feeling of the reality of ne angeis to which I had alluded. Although I was ready to admit that His • a J es - knew far more than I of the way in which the political game was played j 11 f rac b 1 couid ass ure him that to any European observer the picture which he and absurd ^ le an ^ CS ^ rac ti politicians could only appear humiliating J 1 ereu P°u.threw himself into an emotional mood and bewailed i a f had made him King of such a “distressful” country as Iraq, _P ,, e a ^ teinatively to suffer the buffets of the people on one side and h^ P ?

I had criticised his plans, but he still believed them to be sound, and he could do no more than renew the assurances which he had already given. I calmed His Majesty to some extent with soothing words of appreciation of all that he had achieved during the past twelve years, but I added that, much as I regretted it, I felt obliged to repeat the warnings which I had already given warding the step which he proposed to take, and I recalled the unhappy results which had followed a previous experiment of the same kind, when, in 1929, Yasin Pasha, at His Majesty’s instance, had been introduced into Abdul Muhsin Beg's Cabinet. 10 . I could not hide from him the fact that, whatever private assurances were given to me, His Majesty’s Government and, moreover, the British public, who followed events in Iraq closely through the press, would certainly consider that, in the circumstances attending its formation, the new Cabinet would come into office not to continue, but to change, the policy of the two preceding Cabinets in regard to Iraq’s relations with Great Britain. This conclusion could only be modified through a clear and unequivocal statement by the new Cabinet that they intended to stand by the treaty and implement its provisions. Would the new Cabinet, I asked, make such a statement ? The King left the answer of this question to Nuri Pasha, who said that, as the Cabinet had not yet been formed officially, no programme had yet been drawn up. When they took office they would necessarily meet together for that purpose, and he would do his utmost to obtain the inclusion of an affirmation of the Government’s intention to respect all Iraq’s treaties w T ith foreign Governments. I said that he had heard the assurances which the King had given that the change of Government meant no change of policy towards Great Britain. There seemed to me, therefore, to be no reason why the new Government should not make it perfectly clear in their programme that they intended to carry on their relations with Great Britain both in the spirit * and the letter of the treaty, and I sincerely hoped that, in their own interests, they would do so. 11 . I took my leave after a parting appeal to His Majesty not to allow us to be dragged back into the old fruitless political bickering, but to set politics aside and concentrate on administrative efficiency and the economic development of the country. 12. On the 19th March, Naji Beg Shaukat and his colleagues resigned, and on the next day Royal irades were issued appointing the following Cabinet: Prime Minister : Rashid Ali Beg A1 Gilani. Minister for Finance : Yasin Pasha A1 Hashimi. Minister for Foreign Affairs : Nuri Pasha A1 Said. Minister for Economics and Communications : Rustam Beg Haidar. Minister for Interior : Hikmat Beg Sulaiman. Minister of Defence : Jallal Beg Baban. Minister of Justice : Muhammad Zaki Beg. Minister of Education : Saiyid Muhammad Mahdi. Of these, Yasin Pasha, Saiyid Muhammad Mahdi, Muhammad Zaki Beg and Hikmat Beg Sulaiman are members of the party of National Brotherhood, whicn has frequently declared its policy to be to work for the amendment of the treatv of 1930, though Hikmat Sulaiman was formerly a staunch supporter of Abdul Muhsin Beg, and I doubt whether he is really deeply attached to Yasin Pasha or his principles. Nuri Pasha and Rustam Beg are likely to work together, and the Prime Minister, though once a member of Yasm Pasha s party, is now evidently a King’s man, and will be guided by the Palace. Naji Shaukat, who had not realised up to the last moment that he was to be saciinced toi Rashid Ali, and who had resigned mainly with the idea of having his own Cabinet strengthened, feels that he has been tricked, and has letused to accept any office. , , , , , . 13.

This will be proved to you in deed in all the declarations and acts of the Cabinet in the shortest possible time. Your friend, FEISAL Enclosure 2 in No. 1 . Sir F. Humphrys to King Feisal. (Secret and Personal.) Your Majesty, March 21, 1933. I AM most grateful for the secret and personal letter which I received from your Majesty yesterday, and for the assurances which your Majesty renewed therein that the new Cabinet which has been formed would continue to work for the strengthening of the existing friendship between Iraq and Great Britain on the basis of the Treaty of Alliance, 1930. Your Majesty was kind enough to assure me that the goodwill of the new Cabinet towards Great Britain would, at the earliest opportunity, be made clear in their acts as w r ell as in their words. I deeply appreciate this reaffirmation of what your Majesty has often been good enough to tell me in our private talks, and I sincerely trust that, in negotiating with them the several important questions touching the implemen tation of the Treaty of Alliance which are still outstanding, I shall find ample evidence of the spirit of friendly co-operation with which your Majesty is confident your new Ministers are inspired. I remain. &amp;c. F. H. HUMPHRYS.\ THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EAS TERN (Iraq). CONFIDENTIAL. .Z. April 10 , 1933, ^ r tL. 'T !Q^ a Section 1. f FE 1853/105/93] *SA‘ F. Humphrys to Sir John Simon.—(Received April 10.) (No. 207.) F Sir, Bagdad. March 2tl, 1933. WITH reference to my despatch No. 181 of the 22nd March, I have the honour to enclose herewith a record of a conversation which I had three days ago with Yasin Pasha A1 Hashimi, during which he sought to explain to me his position in the new Cabinet and his attitude towards several of the principal questions with which he and his colleagues will be called upon to deal. 2 . I have the impression that, so far as he revealed his opinions to me, he spoke honestly and frankly, and I feel that our talk has done much to clear the air. His views on the general provisions of the Treaty of 1930 are intelligent and understandable and his doubts regarding the practical merits of the Railway Corporation scheme are, I know, shared to some degree in many quarters under no suspicion of Anglophobia. 3. Whatever may have been the words which he used in the debate on the Speech from the Throne, I am disposed to believe that he told me the truth about his intentions. He has criticised the treaty itself, and still more, the extravagant terms in which Nuri Pasha’s supporters have described it as the charter of Iraq's independence, and now. while he is willing to make the most that lie can for Iraq out of the treaty, he will not publicly disavow the standpoint which he took up in opposition, that it merely marks a stage on the road towards his country’s emancipation from foreign control. Moreover, he distrusts the King, and is suspicious of His Majesty’s motives for bringing him back to office. Yasin has seen more than one man with a promising public career discredited and ruined because he had left his friends and broken with his principles for the sake of fickle Palace favour, and he has no intention of going the same way himself. He must, therefore, maintain his reputation and hold together his political supporters, so that, if necessary, he may safely withdraw from office to the Oppo sition without loss of influence or prestige. 4. I had experience of Yasin Pasha as a member of the Cabinet in 1929—30, when he was Minister of Finance in Naji Suwaidi s Administration. On that occasion he dominated the Cabinet and, by his insistence on making too drastic reductions in the numbers of the British advisory staff, he was responsible for Naji Suwaidi’s downfall. Shortly before my arrival in Bagdad he had, in the opinion of my predecessor, goaded a former Prime Minister, Abdul Muhsin Beg, into suicide, by urging him to adopt a programme framed on extieme Nationalist lines. I am inclined to think, however, that two and a half years in opposition have mellowed his views, and that he is not ungrateful to His Majesty’s Govern ment for their successful sponsoring of Iraq s candidature for membeiship or f e League of Nations in 1932. I believe that his main objection to the Ang o- laqi Treaty of 1930 is to be found in the fact that it was negotiated by the King-and his intimate advisers. Nuri and Jafar Pasha and Rustum Haidar, wit om is assistance. While I do not doubt that he will continue to dominate the Cabinet and will obstinately stand out for what he feels to be Iraq s rights, his spontaneous avowal of his intention to consult me privately if things go wrong is a hopetul sign that he has moderated his extremist views. The main difficulty that I foresee, and this apprehension is shared by Yasin as well as by Nun. is whether the new Cabinet, which is composed of men of independent character and opposite views, will be able to keep their peace with the King and avoid quarrelling among themselves. T , P I have, &amp;c. F. H. HUMPHRYS.2 Enclosure in No. 1. Record of a Conversation between Sir Humphry* and VA o TN - vas h V who is Minister of Finance in the new Cabinet, asked if l ould receive him on’the 22nd March, and we conversed for about two hours. 6 He said that he wished to dispel certain misapprehensions which had arisen ve^ardimr the speeches which he had made m the Chamber of Deputies on the .J! n. oFtcnbpH \ T nri Shaukat, the late Prime Minister, on the iBth March when he attacked Nuri Shaukat subject of the treaty. He said that he had been incorrectly reported m some ot the Bagdad newspapers. It was true that he had criticised adversely the Financial Agreement signed by Nuri Pasha and myself m London m August U)30 which had been ratified with the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. . This did not mean however, that he had any intention of agitating for the revision of the Financial Agreement, as he realised that his acceptance of office m the new Government implied agreement with the policy of his colleagues. On my asking what this policy was. he declined to define it m advance of the statement which he said would be shortly made by the Prime Minister. He said that he quite realised that the Treaty of 1930 and its annexures, after its ratification by the Parliaments of our two countries, had become an international bond which must be honourably observed by both parties, but he hoped that, if he remained m office, he would have the opportunity later to approach me, directly 01 indirectly, with a view to the revision of the stipulations in the agreement which concerned the Iraq railways in particular. He admitted that the present arrangement could not be altered except by mutual consent, but he hoped that my Government would show generosity in a matter on which Iraqis of all shades of opinion held very strong views. I reminded him that the agreement on the subject of railways was based on the recommendations of Sir Hilton Young, who was one of the foremost experts of our time and had visited Iraq twice during recent years for the purpose of giving advice on financial questions. The scheme which had been laid down in that agreement involved the creation of a statutory board, whose operations would be subject to the provisions of a Railway Corporation Law. which was was to be passed by agreement between our two Giovernments. Until that law was passed and the scheme recommended by Sir Hilton Young had been tried, it was clearly unreasonable to discuss any other arrangement. If, however, the scheme failed after being given a fair trial, it would be incumbent on our two Governments to devise something else. I assured him that it was the genuine desire of my Government to hand over eventually to the Iraq Government an efficient railway system, which was not over capitalised and which they could run for themselves with a minimum of foreign assistance as soon as Iraqis had been trained for the purpose. I felt sure that he would admit that the interests of his country demanded that the management of the railways should be in experienced hands throughout. We next discussed briefly the Port of Basra, in regard to the management of which Yasin Pasha had no serious objections to urge. I then asked him whether he had really said in Parliament that the existence of Royal Air Force units in Iraq was inconsistent with the country's indepen dence. 1 asin replied somewhat evasively that he had always held the view that the Treaty of 1930 did not confer complete independence on Iraq. He would not urge that complete independence was possible or even beneficial in the present circumstances, but it annoyed him to hear Iraqi statesmen—such as the late Prime Minister—affirm in public that Iraq was now completely independent. After I had explained to him, on the lines of my evidence before the Permanent Mandates (commission at Geneva, the reasons why the location of Royal Air Force units in Iraq was necessary in order to make possible the discharge of Great Britain's obligations under the alliance, I asked him straight out whether he preferred a treaty of alliance with us or an ordinary treaty of friendship. Yasin stated emphatically that a treaty of alliance was necessary for Iraq until she was strong enough to defend herself without foreign assistance. It would take many } ears tor her to bring her army up to the required standard and, in the meantime, •a oiW P n efer ^ alliance with Gr eat Britain to one with any other Power. He sen at Gieat Britain s record in Iraq had been immeasurably more generous *rever ini l loobtfiii aUisktothan any other Great Power would have accomplished, and that he himself, and his friends, were prepared to work in the closest co-operation with Great Britain for the further development of their country’s interests. Knowing that \asin Pasha had been closely associated with the idea of the Pan-Arab Congress. I warned him that it would be the duty of Iraqi statesmen Jn the years that lay ahead to turn their gaze inwards and to work for the ^regeneration of Iraq, rather than to mix themselves up in the affairs of their neighbours. I felt that the best way of assisting their brothers in Syria was to i make a success of the experiment of self-government in Iraq, whereas agitating against the French would only do harm. Yasin agreed that the new Cabinet should interest itself primarily with internal development, but he added bitterly that, however good a model Iraq might prove for Syria, he was convinced that the French Government had no intention whatever of pursuing a liberal policy in that country. I concluded the interview by repeating that the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty must remain the basis of the relations between Great Britain and Iraq, and that I earnestly hoped that the new Cabinet, composed as it was of elements hitherto antagonistic, would make up their minds to work together without jealousy for the good of their country. Yasin thanked me for receiving him in such a friendly spirit and gave me his promise that he would work on the lines that I had indicated. He added, however, that he had taken office with great reluctance and was doubtful whether a Cabinet of strong-minded men belonging to different parties would be able to work harmoniously together for long. He said that he would ask to see me again privately, if things appeared to him to be going wrong.4^3 THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT WITH reference to my despatch No. 181 of the 22nd March, I have the honour to enclose herewith the full text of the programme of the new Cabinet and a summary of the debate thereon which took place in the Chamber on the 27th March. O 2. The programme contains no direct reference to the treaty of 1930, but the first item is clearly an attempt to produce a formula which can, as required, be held either to be a pledge to honour the treaty or an undertaking to satisfy the so-called national aspiration for greater freedom from British influence. When King Feisal, in the presence of his Minister for Foreign Affairs, first discussed with me the programme in draft, it contained a reference to the question of the amendment of the Anglo-Iraqi treaty of 1930 which I held to be objectionable and damaging to Iraq’s reputation abroad. I was able to persuade the King that, in order to establish the credit of the new State m foreign countries, it would be necessary to create the impression abroad that Iraq was determined to honour her international obligations, and I finally prevailed upon him to omit any direct suggestion that the new Cabinet would work for the amendment of the treaty. I reminded His Majesty that it was largely on the strength of this treatv, wdiich had been in force for less than six months, that Iraq had been admitted to membership of the League, and that it must continue EASTERN (Iraq).

Humphrys to Sir John Sim on.—(Received February 27.) (No. 114.) SR, Bagdad. February 16. 1933. WITH reference to my telegram No. 21 of the ilth February, I have the honour to offer the following observations on the general election which concluded on the 8 th February with the final polling for Deputies in all constituencies. 2 . The progress of the somewhat lengthy procedure of first and second degree elections, which has to be carried out under the existing law, aroused remarkably little public interest. The press confined itself in the main to expressing pious hopes that able and honest men would be returned, and the political parties showed little activity. The general secretary of the Nationalist party, Jafar Chalabi-abu-Timman. repeating his tactics at the last election in 1930, made an abortive attempt to persuade the Executive Committee of the party to declare a boycott of the elections, but this was the only ripple which disturbed the placid surface of the electoral waters. The party of National Brotherhood, of which Yasin Pasha is the leading figure, made no pronouncement of policy, and Nuri Pasha's Ahd party maintained a similarly cryptic silence. 3. In the final polling the candidates nominated by the Government were everywhere successful, but this does not necessarily mean that the new Chamber will give constant support to the present Cabinet. It seems that the men now elected have all been carefully chosen by the King, and it is as King’s men and not party men that they have secured their seats. I anticipate, therefore, that the new Chamber will only support the present Cabinet for so long as they continue to enjoy the King's favour and that, when this favour is withdrawn, the Deputies will readily give their support to another Cabinet of the King’s choice. 4. Yasin Pasha and a number of his friends, such as Ali Jaudat, Jamil Madfai and Muhammad Zaki. have been returned and it seems clear that he could both form a Cabinet and find a majority in the Chamber, if the King should call upon him to do so. The fact that the election was not conducted on the usual party lines is probably explained by the King's desire to have a so-called National Parliament, and by the promises which he lavishly gave for the nomination of the principal leaders and publicists of the various political parties. The net result is that the King has secured the election of a Parliament on which he can ring any Cabinet changes he pleases without a dissolution or inconvenience to himself. 5. I do not think, however, that His Majesty intends at present to dismiss Naji Beg Shauket and his colleagues, though it is impossible to be certain that events may not occur to change his mind. King Feisal may still have leanings towards Yasin Pasha as a Prime Minister, but I do not think that His Majesty would invite him to form a Cabinet, if he felt that this was likely to jeopardise his relations with His Majesty’s Government. Nor do I believe that Yasin Pasha would accept the premiership unless he was confident of obtaining a sufficiently free hand to carry out the main principles of his own programme, which have hitherto aimed at a drastic revision of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. 6 . Thirty-two of the Deputies in the last Chamber have been re-elected, but although Nuri Pasha’s newspaper claims that this is a mark of popular approval of the work of Nuri Pasha’s Cabinet, I do not myself think that these Deputies have this time returned as Nuri’s supporters. Of his Cabinet, only one has been re-elected, Jamal Baban, the Minister for Justice, with whom he quarrelled last year over the affair of the anonymous letters. Three members of the Executive Committee of the Nationalist party have been elected, including Abdul Ghafur-al-Badri, the editor of the Istiqlai news paper; the previous knowledge of their nomination was no doubt the reason for the refusal to boycott the elections to which I have referred above. Other Deputies whose election is noteworthy are Hamid-al-Wadi, brother of the present Minister of Justice, and until recently aide-de-camp to the Amir [711 dd—1]2 AMullah, ^Q^gjja^editor o^the oW-ertabli^hed^tnoderate n^wspape^*^'? A?o»l KiSWi. of the Zoba tribe, son of the late Sheikh ” Dha There^HMriang 0 e I 'in thT tribal “representatives, except in Diwaniyah, where a somewhat undesirable element has been introduced. where a som certain that when Kmg Feisal visited the Diwaniyah and Karbala liwas last November his chief ob.iect was to endeavour to obtain the Support o X Ulema and the tribal sheikhs for conscnptiom The Ulema are sridto have refused to take sides in a political question, but in return for undertakings touching their personal and material interests the King succeeded hi obtaining from a number of tribal leaders a promise that they would not oppose the introduction of a system of compulsory service m the army. Among these were several men including. Abdul Wahid-al-Haj, bikkar, of the powerful Fatlah tribe Muhammad-al-Abtan, of the Khazal, and Aua-al-Dalli, whose past record is by no means satisfactory. These three have now become Deputies for the Diwaniyah liwa, evidently on a pro-conscription coupon. 8 I have little doubt that the King hopes to see a JNational bervice Bill introduced into Parliament during the next session, and there is a danger that he may believe that the support of these sheikhs means that its application to the Euphrates area will excite no opposition. i • i o • t 9 I do not yet know precisely what form the proposed National bervice Law will take, but I fear that if the’ Government do not exercise great caution in applying’conscription to the tribes, particularly to those on the Euphrates and to the Kurds, future events are likely to prove that His Majesty is mistaken in believing that the tribesmen's deep-rooted dislike of military service can be overcome by winning over a few of the sheikhs. 10 . Parliament is expected to meet early in March and to sit for three months. I will address you separately on the subject of conscription, when I have ascertained further particulars of the King's plans, and I shall not fail to impress on His Majesty the necessity for proceeding very slowly and for avoiding a conflict with the tribes on this important issue.

E 1327/105/93] Sir F. Humphry* to Sir John Simon (No. 145.) Sir, Bagdad, March 2, 1933. AT an audience which I had with King Feisal on the 27th February, His Majesty again referred to his dissatisfaction with some of the members of the present Cabinet, and developed the views which I have already brought to your notice in my telegram No. 32 of the 27th February. He explained that, while the Ministers were all men of excellent character, and had, since they had been in office, done their best to discharge their difficult functions, he felt bound tu recognise that both individually and collectively they had not shown themselves really competent to deal with the many important problems with which the Government was at present confronted. They had come into office at a time when, for a variety of reasons, it had not been possible to call upon others with more experience who had previously shown greater efficiency and ability. Circum stances had now happily changed. The results of the elections had given complete satisfaction to all parties and groups, personal differences between public men had been settled, and better and more capable men would now be willing to take office if invited to do so. The Prime Minister had himself confessed that he felt that his Cabinet was weak, and had consulted His Majesty as to the steps which could be taken to strengthen it. What were my views'? Much work lay ahead in which I was closely interested; did I not think that it would be done better if some more experienced Ministers were introduced into the Cabinet? 2 I said that I assumed that His Majesty had in mind to bring into the Cabinet members of the Opposition who were believed to be hostile to the policy followed not only by the present Government but by the Government of Nuri Pasha. It seemed to me that what the country required above all things was a rest from political strife and leisure to pursue a sound economic policy for its internal development. I reminded His Majesty that his previous efforts to eradicate criticism by giving office to Opposition leaders had led to disastrous results. These mixed Cabinets had been torn by internal jealousies, and had never succeeded in producing any constructive programme for the benefit of the country. I feared that it was inevitable that a similar fate would overtake any so-called national Cabinet which might be formed at the present time, unless His Majesty was able to hold it together by his own unaided efforts. I could not conceive, for instance, that harmonious relations would long continue between Nuri Pasha and Yasin Pasha, or between either of them and the present Prime Minister, without some powerful overriding influence being continuously at work to bind them together. Moreover, the Opposition leaders had announced their uncompromising hostility to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, and were determined, so far as could be deduced from their public utterances, to agitate for the drastic amendment of its terms. I warned the King not to attempt such a dangerous experiment, unless he was assured of the genuine willingness of the political leaders to work together without jealousy to promote their country s interests and to observe loyally their treaty and other contractual obligations. 3 King Feisal agreed that the time for political agitation was definitely past. He said that the opposition of Yasin Pasha and his friends towards the treatv of 1930 had been based entirely on their personal hostility to Nuri Pasha.. , That hostility was now a thing of the past, and neither they, nor any other responsible Iraqi, wished to alter the terms of the existing alliance with Great Britain. He said that, when Parliament assembled on the 8 th March, the Prime Minister would make a statement on the Government s policy, and if, aftei this,. Yasin Pasha or anyone else joined the Cabinet, it would be cleai that they accepted the Prime Minister’s programme. 1 need have no misgiving whatever [739 n— 1 ] \-oonceiuiiu; the treaty. As regards the possibility^ fiction among the members Taxational Cabinet, His Majesty agreed .that this was a real danger against which he would have to take .every precaution. The polUca leaders, however, h- d all olaced themselves unreservedly in his hands, and had solemnly undertaken to be suided by his wishes. He felt convinced that the present political situation was sineularly favourable to the formation of a national Cabinet of all the talents ' and he believed that, having regard to the special economic problems which remained to be tackled, such a Government would be m the best interests of the country He did not, however, consider the matter to be of immediate urgency, and he would seek a further opportunity for consulting me before taking any acme st j P ® hanked jj ig Majesty for having spoken to me with such frankness about the position of the Government, and assured him that I should always welcome an opportunity for exchanging views on these important matters. His Maiestv would appreciate that I was not concerned with the personnel of the Cabinet so much as with the policy that it would be likely to adopt towards those questions in which my Government were particularly interested, and that, as a friend who had worked for the independence of Iraq, I was particularly anxious that the future recprd of the Government should be marked by sound constructive achievements. ' 5 . I said that the fate of Syria, in which His Majesty expressed so lively an interest, might well depend to a large extent on the success of the experiment in self-government which was now being carried out in Iraq.

But Sir Hubert Young's despatch of 3rd November (1060, on P.Z.7527) and the subsequent despatch of 17th November (1093, on P.Z.7454/32) from Sir Francis Humphrys are of considerable interest in connection with the general attitude of Faisal ana the policy he is likely to adopt now that Iraq has attained independent status. The King is anxious to remain in the centre of the stage 'and to assume the direction of affairs himself' and is impatient of the advice of his K ministers. Sir Hubert Young remarks at the same/, fU f r shades of political opinion and that “while the methods adopted may have 'been open to criticism the results achieved have certainly justified them. The only douht in my mind is whether he will he strong enough to resist the temptation of allowing the Treaty of 1930 to take the place of the Mandate Treaty of 1922 as a pawn in his own V- political game. Sir Francis Humphrys, however, sees “no indication.. .of his wishing to dispense with British help and guidance and I believe he is sincerely grateful for what we have done for his throne and his country. c. The general advice given by H.M. Ambassador to the King, as recorded in Bagdad despatch of 17th November, is of interest. The only point which much concerns us is the proposed arrangement for the future of the Shatt-el-Arab, discussed in paragraphs 12-15.

November 18, 1932. CONFIDENTIAL. *• Section 1. [E 6230/9/93] No _ \ s . Sir l. Humphrys to Sir John Simon.—(Received November 18.) (No. 1093. Confidential.) (j • ' , ieference to paragraph 5 of my despatch No. 1076, Confidential, of tne 10m November iast, reporting the presentation of my letter of credence to Iving leisal on the 9th November, I have the honour to submit the following account of the private talk wdiich I had with His Majesty on the same evening :— 2. The King received me at his country house at Harthiyah, and the interview lasted for nearly three hours. / 3. ^ He began by renewing, in the most lavish terms, his thanks to His Majesty King George and to His Majesty s Government for their unfailing help and' guidance during the past years, which alone, he said, had enabled Iraq to obtain her independence through admission to the League of Nations. After thanking His Majesty for his generous appreciation of my country’s help and referring to his own notable contribution to the work which had led to Iraq’s successful apotheosis at Geneva, I observed that the emancipation of Iraq from mandatory control had naturally attracted wide attention. There were many who still thought that this had been done prematurely, and events in Iraq would now be watched very closely to see whether the confidence of His Majesty’s Government in the fitness of the Iraqi nation for self-government was in fact well founded. I also pointed out that the future of Syria, in which I knew His Majesty was deeply interested, would depend in a large measure on events in Iraq. If all went well and Iraq justified the trust which had been placed in her, it would be much easier for Syria to make rapid progress along the road already traversed by Iraq. On the other hand, if the misgivings of the pessimists were realised and the termination of the mandate over Iraq were followed by disorders or serious deterioration in the administration of the country, then world opinion would certainly harden against an early termination of the mandate in Syria. 4. The King said that he fully realised the very heavy responsibilities which had devolved on Iraq, and he was determined that they should be creditably discharged. His Majesty’s Government need not fear that the confidence which they had shown in Iraq would prove to have been misplaced. He and his Govern ment would spare no effort to show the world that Iraq was worthy of the place which she had been given in the comity of nations. He also fully appreciated the influence which events in Iraq would have on the fate of Syria, and this fact would prove an additional incentive to the Iraqi people to safeguard the good name of their country and to prove the fitness of the Arabs to govern themselves in modern conditions. A 5. I then referred briefly to the Assyrian question and warned His Majesty that as the reply of the League to the Assyrian petition of last June would probably not be considered as satisfactory by most of the Assyrian leaders, it was likely that the Patriarch would return from Geneva in a very disgruntled frame of mind. I did not, I said, wish to alarm His Majesty, but I thought it necessary to warn him that there might be a recrudescence of Assyrian difficulties later in the year. He assured me that the Iraqi Government were fully alive to the necessity for adopting the most sympathetic policy in regard to the Assyrians, and were willing to do all in their power to make them contented citizens of the country. In this as in all other important matters he would always seek my advice. Generous treatment of the minorities was, he added, an essential feature of his policy. 6. His Majesty then reminded me that, as he had informed me before I left Iraq in the summer, it was his hope that now that Iraq had entered the League of Nations, and the question of her relations with Great Britain had been finally settled, the Government would concentrate on internal affairs and particularly on Sir, Bagdad, November 17, 1932 [627 s—1]2 economic development. He ZZtt subject of the development of railways and the raising of loans for productive 7 This gave me an opportunity to speak to His Majesty about recent nolit cal events in Bagdad. I said that I had had valuable consultations with financial and technical experts in London, and had returned with suggestion^ which I would offer to His Majesty in due course. It seemed to me, however, that as Parliament had been dissolved, practical progress with these schemes would he verv much delayed, particularly as the new Cabinet were not familiar with the preliminary work which had already been done. It was I went on to say a great disappointment to me on my return to Bagdad to find the Government which had done so much good work for the country, and the Chamber which had supported it in their task, both summarily dismissed. Apart from the difficulties and delays which would arise from these circumstances in legard to carrying out the schemes of development which we had mentioned, the change of Government and the dissolution of Parliament which had been suddenly effected that morning would, I feared, create new obstacles to the early settlement of a number of important matters, such as the conclusion of the Tripartite Agreement with Persia about the Shatt-al-Arab and the formation of the Railway Corporation, which I had hoped to take up immediately after my return. Moreover, I felt that it would be exceedingly difficult for me to explain to my Government how it came about that the Government and Parliament which had concluded and ratified the Treaty of Alliance of 1930 were dismissed immediately the treaty came into force. At Geneva, too, these events were likely to be regarded with misgiving, since they would quite probably lead to the general conclusion that the Government which had obtained Iraq's admission to the League and had given the undertakings required by the League enjoyed neither His Majesty’s confidence nor popular support, and that they had been removed to give place to others who would endeavour to modify or even to reverse the policy of their predecessors. 8. The King readily seized my point, but assured me most categorically that the change of Government had no connexion whatever with foreign policy. His dissatisfaction with Nuri Pasha had arisen entirely from the latter’s handling of internal affairs. He appreciated the great work which Nuri Pasha had done for Iraq during his period of office in the matter of the Treaty of Alliance with Great Britain and the admission of Iraq to membership of the League of Nations, but for a considerable time he had had serious differences with him in regard to his policy in home affairs. Nuri Pasha had, contrary to His Majesty’s advice, persistently promoted and appointed to posts of responsibility in the Administra- tion men without either ability or integrity; men whose sole claim to the Prime Minister s patronage had been that they were his personal supporters. This, although perhaps not known to me, was only too commonly known to the man in n S S eet ’ anC ^’ consec l uence ; Nuri Pasha’s Government had fallen into disrepute and the prestige of the Administration had suffered. In spite of His Majesty’s requent exhortations the Prime Minister had refused to change his tactics, and , e A, 1 e diveigence of their views over this question was the principal reason for e rune Minister s resignation. He was confident, however, that the new oyernmen , by their programme which would be published in a few days, and by ^/J U i bS T ent i a f tS ’i WOuld / a P idl y dis P el an y misgivings which I might feel in ^ th f R olltlcal significance of Nuri Pasha’s resignation. They had been nrevimiQ rwm and a none, excepting the Prime Minister, had had resnormiMp r&gt; m( f fP e y kad all proved their ability and honesty in emohasispH S fi! n - Administration. Moreover, and this, His Majesty allep-iance to anv virtue, none brought with him the contamination of anegiance to any political party or creed. referred. A HisTrS a ti he tdf!L ! ! 1 u d i ealin ?

Ihe King thanked me for my friendly advice and said that hK disagreement with Nuri Pasha in the realm of politics in no way affected his personal feelings towards him. He still regarded him as one of his oldest and dearest friends. The Government had under consideration the establishment of Legations at Rome and Berlin to be in charge of a single Minister. Possibly JNun Pasiia could for a time with advantage hold this post. He then said that he wished to tell me of a conversation which he had ad the previous morning with the Persian Minister, Saiyid Baqir Khan Kazemi. Ihe Minister had just returned from a hurried visit to Tehran and stated that he had been given authority to negotiate with the Iraqi Government the several treaties and agreements which had already been tentatively discussed. He had mentioned, in particular, the proposed treaty concerning the Shatt-al-Arab. His Governments he had said, were especially concerned to remove the disabilities from which their interests suffered at present in these waters, and were hopeful that the Iraqi Government, m view of their common interests and close friendly relations, would adopt a conciliatory attitude in the matter of the rectification of the frontiers in the Shatt-al-Arab sector. 13. His Majesty had replied that he had thought this issue had already been settled in principle when Nuri Pasha had discussed it with the Persian Minister of the Court during His Majesty’s visit to Tehran last spring, and he was surprised to learn that the Persian Government wished to reopen the question of the sovereignty of these waters. It was, however, not a matter which he could discuss himself and no doubt the Minister would take it up with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs if he had been instructed to do so. 14. He then expressed to me the most serious apprehensions concerning the intentions of the Persian Government. He feared that they would make their demands in the Shatt-al-Arab a major political question and might even try to refer it to the League for settlement. He instanced their obstinacy in the matter of Bahrein and said that he felt that they would prove to be proportionately more difficult to deal with in a matter in which far greater interests were involved. For his part he felt that any limitation of Iraq’s complete sovereignty over the waters of the Shatt-al-Arab was quite unthinkable and he hoped that His Majesty’s Government, in view of the Treaty of Alliance, would give their full support to Iraq in resisting all efforts of the Persian Government to seize part of this vital channel. He also informed me that Feroughi Khan, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, had intimated his desire for an audience in a few days’ time, when passing through Bagdad on his return from Geneva. He feared that Feroughi, too, would probably endeavour to discuss this issue. 15. I said that my advice to His Majesty was to hold the Persian Govern ment to the arrangement for a Conservancy Board, which had been provisionally agreed on last spring. I had myself discussed the Shatt-al-Arab question when I was in Tehran prior to His Majesty’s own visit, and the Minister of the Court, to whom I had explained the Conservancy Board proposals, had accepted the main principles of the scheme as satisfying the claims of the Persian Government. I assured His Majesty of my sympathy and support in safeguarding the vital interests of Iraq in any matter which concerned her strategic frontiers^ 16. I then referred to the future relations between the Embassy and the British advisers in the Iraqi Government. I said that I did not wish to convey the impression that I proposed to interfere in internal administrative matters, but in our common interest it seemed to me to be necessary that there should continue to be close liaison between the Iraqi Government and the Embassy. This could best be done through the advisers, and I hoped that His Majesty would agree that they should continue to keep me informed about all important events which might occur in their respective spheres. His Majesty said emphatically that he regarded it as most desirable that the closest touch should be maintained between ad risers and the Embassy, and that he considered it j I I4 J - t T i u u A ^ vpl1 the fullest information of all important develop- essential that I should beg should be given privately to advisers that ments.

Meanwhile, he is eager to assume the direction of aflairs himself, and is impatient of the advice of his Ministers. I see no indication, however, of his wishing to dispense with British help and guidance, and I believe he is sincerely grateful for what we have done for his throne and his coun ry.

On Thursday morning I received a telephone message from the palace that King Feisal was glad to hear that I was better and would like to see me. After a short conversation on matters of no importance, he surprised me by saving that Nuri Pasha, who had dined alone with him the previous night, had announced his intention of resigning, $nd that he wished to consult me on the position thus created. He repeated what he had already told me (see paragraph 7 of my despatch No. 1000 of the 13th October), that he had been for some time working for a coalition or National Government under the leadership of Yasin Pasha A1 Hashimi, but that he had been unable to induce him to make the public recantation of his opposition to the treaty of 1930, which was, of course, an essential preliminary to his being summoned to form a Government. He did not altogether like the idea of asking Nuri to form a new Government, partly because his health was uncertain, partly because he w r as inclined to interfere with the work of the Ministries, but chiefly because he differed from him fundamentally in his concep tion of the correct policy for an Iraqi Government to pursue. Nuri was always quoting the precedent o,f the Earl of Chatham (whom I had some difficulty in recognising under the pseudonym of Bitt) to justify the employment of persons of no reputation in order to defeat the equally disreputable manoeuvres of the Opposition. He was himself entirely opposed to this theory, the practical application of which would, in his opinion, lead to the ruin of the country. He felt that purity of public life, so far as this was attainable among his admittedly imperfect subjects, was the only true aim. For this reason he was anxious to entrust the task of government to some more scrupulous individual than Nuri-as- Said, whom he would prefer to retain as Minister for Foreign Affairs. 2. On my enquiring what had led to this, to me, unexpectedly rapid development, he said that it had always been understood that Nuri Pasha, whose sole task had been to carry through to their successful conclusion the negotiations for the treaty of 1930. and for the admission of Iraq to membership of the League of Nations, would tender his resignation as soon as he returned from Geneva. I replied that I was well aware that some reconstruction of the Cabinet was in contemplation, but that I had not anticipated that Nuri Pasha would actually resign, and that he should announce his intention of doing so within a few hours of his return to Bagdad, and only a week before the opening of Parliament, was- a great surprise to me. In any case, I assumed that King Feisal did not contemplate any immediate action, in view not only of his promise to Sir Francis Humphrys that he would await his return before making any change, but also off the obvious propriety, if only as a matter of courtesy, of allowing the Prime Minister to report to Parliament on the success of his mission. 3. To the first of these arguments His Majesty replied that his promise had been given at a time when he had expected Sir Francis Humphrys and Nuri Pasha to return to Bagdad together from Europe a fortnight before the date fixed for the opening of Parliament. His hand had now been forced by Nuri Pasha’s resignation, more especially as he understood that article 39 of the Constitution made it necessary that Senators and Deputies should receive their full salary of 4,000 rupees apiece, even if Parliament sat for only one day. He fully hoped that Nuri Pasha would form a new Government, but what was to- happen if this hope was falsified, and it proved impossible to find another PrimeMinister who was prepared to work with a Parliament which had been elected under Nun s auspices, and which consisted almost exclusively of his personal su orters ? He f u il y realised that it was desirable that the Prime Minister should have an opportunity of reporting to Parliament upon his mission, but was. this claim so vital that he could take upon himself the responsibility of committnff the Iraqi Treasury to an expenditure of 5 or 6 lakhs merely in order to satisfy it? He begged me to advise him. 4 I pointed out in reply that, even if he were unsuccessful m inducing Nuri Pasha either to withdraw his resignation or to form a new Cabinet, I saw no necessity whatever to dissolve a Parliament of whom the vast majority were committed to the policy for which the King himself stood, nor did I think that it would be difficult to find a Prime Minister who would be willing to assume office with its support. With regard to the constitutional point. I said that I would, if he desired it, take legal advice, but I could hardly believe that there was not some way out of the technical difficulty to which he referred. I then expressed the hope that he would find it possible to compose his differences with Nuri Pasha, which did not appear to me from what he said to be so grave that there was no hope. After promising to do his best, he asked me to consider the constitutional question, and to take tea with him at his farm on the following day. He gave me the impression that he would await the result of my enquiries before taking any action in the matter. 5. The same evening Nuri Pasha called upon me at my house and gave me a different version of what had happened. He told me that on his arrival at Alexandria the Iraqi consul-general, whose brother is King Feisal’s Chamberlain, had informed him that it was the King’s intention to form a new Government under Yasin Pasha, in which he was to be Minister for Foreign Affairs, and had asked him whether he would accept office. He had naturally declined to give any reply, or to discuss the question, but he had taken the first opportunity after his return to Bagdad of asking the King what his intentions really were. The King, while denying that he had arrived at any decision about who was to be Prime Minister, had admitted that he wished to make a change, and had called upon him to resign, which he had accordingly done, but he did not make it clear to me that he had resigned officially. He did not believe that the King had finally abandoned hope of employing Yasin Pasha, though he hoped that the publication in Bagdad next day of an interview which the latter had given to a Syrian journal would have this effect. I told him that I was to see King Feisal again next evening, and he suggested that I should ask to be received in the morning instead, as the King always became more difficult to deal with as the day wore on. I accordingly sent a message to the palace asking for my audience to take place in the morning, on the ground that the evening air would be bad for my rheumatism, which was always liable to be aggravated by chills. Io this I received a reply that the King much regretted that he was engaged all ay and would receive me on Saturday morning. It is clear to me from what subsequently transpired that he had purposely suggested an evening audience, and that, even if I nad seen him at the time originally fixed, it would have made no difference. 6^ Eaily on Saturday morning Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, who had untortunately been away from Bagdad until Fridav afternoon, called at my douse and we discussed the situation. He had had a long talk with Nuri Pasha ir °? aS ^ 6 burned, and had found him very sore at the way he had been treated and reluctant, m the circumstances, to take office again either as Prime that a fV mi ?T^ Foreign Affairs. Sir Kinahan fully shared my view ’ - ’ ^so u ion of Parliament was both unnecessary and highly undesirable, y Foreign Affairs. Sir Kinahan fully shared my view and fnit o 0; C* ar * iamen t was both unnecessary and highly undesirable, that an pffrfu v 1 ia consideration of prudence and policv demanded in some form S ° U Jif mac ^ e to se 'cure Nuri Pasha’s continued retention in office with Kino* Fpieaff 0 n er j at eaSt ^ 0r a ^ ecent period. My postponed audience Nuri p a JLg tW ° 0 f V - h ace ^nediately afterwards. On the assumption that hands and with th na K 0n ; w }* thev 0 ^ ial or unofficial, was still in the King’s nf pfliuA W1 ^ ^ object of domg what I could to of Parliament and it/ u / uoi ng wnat i could to avert a premature dissolution mv fears 5 wbohl y appointment of Yasin Pasha as Prime Minister, I 'wished the KinPd b t e T revl '' ed b y what Nuri Pasha had told me, I said that said anything to nfe of fN hitentions 1 ' 01 ' 18 ^ Seri ° US oonsideration before lle[627 o—2] B ^ 3 /. The first point was that the eyes of the world were upon Iraq at this- critical stage in the national fortunes. My conversations with my diplomatic colleagues had shown me that, while most of them hoped that Iraq was now fairly ^ the road to a prosperity which would rival, if indeed it did not surpass, the prosperity of Egypt, there was a general feeling of anxiety lest,those in authority should move too fast. There would be no doubt that they had expressed these views to their respective Governments, and it would be unfortunate if within a month of Iraq attaining her full independence they found themselves compelled to report that hasty or ill-considered action had been taken. In the second place, there were decencies to be observed; the Prime Minister had just returned from taking his seat with the representatives of the nations of the world in the Assembly of the League, and an unfortunate impression would be created in the capitals of Europe if on his return to Bagdad he did not present himself before Parliament, in accordance with universal precedent, to report upon his mission. 8. These were considerations of external policy upon which, apart from my own desire to help him, I felt it to be appropriate for me to utter a friendly word of warning as the representative of the Power which had introduced Iraq to membership of the League, and to which he had so solemnly assured me only three weeks before that he felt himself to be peculiarly responsible. There was a third point which I wished to lay before him as the representative of the Power with whom Iraq had now for one month been in special treaty relations. If the reins of government were at any time to be entrusted to an Iraqi statesman as to whose determination to abide by not only tfye letter but the spirit of the treaty of 1930 there was or could be the faintest suspicion or doubt, it would have a deplorable effect upon His Majesty’s Government. In conclusion, I advised him as a friend not to be hasty in entrusting too much authority to any individual of whose personal loyalty to himself he was not absolutely convinced. All men had enemies, and it would be only prudent for him to keep some power in reserve, at any rate for the present. 9. King Feisal thanked me warmly for my advice, which, he said, was very precious to him, and dealt briefly with my first three points in turn. He said that he was not familiar with European standards, but his Eastern friends were always blaming him, not for haste in action, but for excessive caution. This reputation he hoped he would continue to deserve. With regard to Nuri Pasha meeting Parliament, he had already decided that this must certainly be done. As to the treaty, he reminded me that he had always insisted that any individual who had publicly opposed it must equally publicly avow the error of his ways before he was offered any responsible position in the Iraqi Government. Up to a few days ago he had hoped that Yasin Pasha would be ready to do this, but from the interview which he had read in the Bagdad press the day before it was clear that he must abandon this hope. The fourth point he left unanswered. He then told me that he had been much offended by Nuri Pasha having called a meeting of the Council of Ministers on Thursday, at which they had passed a resolution resigning en masse. This resignation he had accepted on Friday, at the same time asking Nuri Pasha to continue to direct the Government until a new Cabinet had been formed. He had invited Nuri Pasha himself to undertake this, and expected to hear from him later in the morning whether he was prepared to do so, but he feared that it was impossible to bridge the gulf between them. 10. He then talked of Nuri Pasha's delinquencies for oyer an hour, actually referring at one stage to the personal advice I had given him not to put too much power in the hands of a possible enemy. I at once challenged this wilful misapplication of my advice, and said that he knew quite well that there wms not a man in the country who was, or would ever be, a more devoted and loyal supporter of himself and his policy than Nuri Pasha As Said. He admitted that this was true, but said that he and Nuri were like husband and wife : they had their occasional differences, and must from time to time see less of one another. I suggested that if this were so, it would be better for them to stay together at least long enough to avoid an open scandal, and in the end he promised once more to do his best, and I left him. . 11. I then called at Nuri Pasha’s house, and found that his attitude had hardened. He said that the root of his differences with King Feisal was that the latter was continually abusing his position to secure petty personal advantages for himself and his entourage, and regaled me with a numbei of instances ofevasion of taxes and customs duties, favouritism in diplomatic appointments, illegal granting of pensions and the like, the continuance of which no self-respecting Prime Minister could be expected to tolerate. On my remarking that the King had reached a somewhat different diagnosis, he said that he kn^w King Eeisal disagreed with his own theory of politics, which was, however, bad^ upon the high precedent set by the Earl of Chatham at a time when English standards approximated more closely than they did at present to those prevailiim in modern Iraq. I replied that I found it difficult to believe that agreement would not be reached if there was no other cause of difference between King Feisal and himself than those which had been explained to me, and pointed out the absurdity of two old friends separating at such a moment as this merely because neither was able to live up to the lofty ideals of the other. He admitted the paradox, but saw little prospect of reconciliation after what had happened, and thought the best solution would be for Naji Shaukat or some other individual to form a Ministry, and for him to stand aside. Difficulties would at once arise, the Cabinet would soon fall and he would be called in again on his own terms. ’ No great harm would result from this, and meanwhile he was prepared to serve as a Director in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in order that his experience mioffit still be available. His position, if he accepted the portfolio for Foreign Affair?in such a Ministry, would be impossible, as the King would suspect him of being behind the opposition which would undoubtedly be offered to his illegal proceedings. Only under Yasin Pasha, if his programme was acceptable, would he serve as Foreign Minister, not because he trusted him, but because he would tt ^ ^ position to defeat Yasin s schemes and save King Feisal from himself, le did not, however, see how Yasin Pasha could at this stage withdraw from the position he had taken up. Nuri Pasha then departed to see the King, and I returned to my house ™ e L J. wa s again visited by Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, who had meanwhile been with King Feisal. He told me that the King had assured him that Yasin Pasha was now completely out of court as a candidate for the premiership, and that ° f e C P T U .4 ^ the situation created by Nuri Pasha's resignation Z wh 2 nn P ^r % ^ a n tG f0rm a 1 Cabinet - While we still discussing the whoie question Nun Pasha appeared and told us that the King had received wKrfc? a ?'^ d hi “ first to form a CoaIitlon Gov g ern“rnd T .i • , declined to do this, to form a Government of his own supporters assured that 1 th/K- '‘'k 1 ^ h ? f ° rm a new Government if he could be tha^this was the fare 8 Th confidence m him, but that he was not satisfied all h(m „ J as „ the ca ® e ' t .

He then told us that he was summoning Nan Shaukat to form a Ministry, and I returned to my house and despatched my telegram No. 335 of the 29th October. It was clear to mv-that Kmo Feisal still contemplated the early dissolution of Parliament and this could only mean that he still hoped to bring in Yasin Pasha ^ 0l \w m f n V n § ° f Z 116 31st 0ctober ’ Sir Kinahan called at my house and told me that a fresh development had arisen. King Feisal had duly sent for ISaji Shaukat on Saturday evening, and invited him to form a Government, but while the latter was engaged m sounding his colleagues and supporters, he had again been summoned by the King, who had withdrawn his invitation on the ground that Nun Pasha had now agreed to accept the portfolio for Foreign Aftairs under Yasm Pasha. The unfortunate Naji, who had his list nearly ready had been very much taken aback, but had perforce submitted with as good a orace as possible to the caprice of his Royal master. Yasin Pasha had paid a formal Tm °q- Y'’ v were to open negotiations forthwith. Nuri Pasha had to d Sir Kinahan that the King had now come to the conclusion that it was unnecessary tor Yasm Pasha to disavow his recent utterances publicly, but that u b ™ se w °uld only join Yasin s Cabinet on two conditions : that Parliament should not be dissolved, and that Naji Shaukat should remain at the Interior. If agreement y as reached, Nuri Pasha was to be sent to me, in what capacity I was unable to discover, to sound me on the attitude which His Majesty's Government would adopt to the new proposal. This conversation led to the despatch of mv telegram No. 336 of the 31st October. 15 On the 1 st November Parliament was opened with the usual ceremony, and the resignation of Nuri Pasha was publicly announced in suitable terms! Both the King and the President of the Chamber referred appreciatively to his services, and he was given the correct opportunity to give a final account of his stewardship. On the following day, Sir Kinahan Cornwmllis informed me that Yasm and Nuri had failed to reach agreement, and that Naji Shaukat had again been summoned to form a Ministry. It is anticipated that Naji will himself retain the portfolio of the Interior, and that he will surround himself with colleagues who aye for the most part Government officials, and have had no ministerial experience. He is said to be in favour of a dissolution of Parliament, but up to the time of closing this despatch no decision has been taken on this point, and the new Ministry is not yet in being. If it is in fact formed on the above lines, it is unlikely to survive for long, and King Feisal will again be faced with the choice between his real friend and his secret enemy, unless, in the meantime, he succeeds in bringing them together. I believe that he honestly regards this as the wisest policy, and I do not agree with Nuri Pasha that his recent manoeuvres have been Hue solely to his tendency to change the howling whenever a member of his team has taken enough wickets to distract public attention from the captain of the side. It cannot be denied that he has been remarkably successful during the past ten years in maintaining connexion with all shades of political opinion, and, while the methods adopted may have been open to criticism, the results achieved have certainly justified them. The only doubt in my mind is whether he will be strong enough to resist the temptation of allowing the treaty of 1930 to take the place of the mandate-treaty of 1922 as a pawn in his own political game.

I am informed that the Government intend to proceed with the elections at once, but it is impossible, at present, to forecast how they will result. 4. In previous elections the Government in power have had little difficulty in securing the return of a majority of their candidates, but I think it probable that on this occasion the King intends to use his own influence to bring about the election of a Chamber which will include all the principal figures in public life, whether they are supporters of the present Government or not. With such a Parliament it would be possible for His Majesty to effect Cabinet changes without fresh elections. If this plan is carried out, I doubt whether the new Parliament will support Naji Beg for long. He will probably foresee this and may endeavour to resist the King s intention. In that event I fear that another ministerial crisis may develop even before the elections are completed. 6. On the other hand, the new Prime Minister and his colleagues have at present no organised public support and depend entirely on the King's favour. In these circumstances they may have no alternative but to fall in with His Majesty’s plans, even though these may be clearly inimical to their continuance in office. own I have, &amp;c. F. H.
