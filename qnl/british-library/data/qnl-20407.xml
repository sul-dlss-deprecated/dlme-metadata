The proposal to hold a conference at Kuwait in order to settle outstanding questions between Hejd and neighbouring territories is approved by H.MGovt. The main objects of the conference will be:- (a) The delimitation of the Hejd-Trans-Jordan frontier. (b) The solution of differences between Hejd and Iraq, arising out of the presence within Iraq borders of llejdi tribes (Shammar etc.). (c) Consideration of the desirability of amending the. Mohammerah Convention. i In addition to the above, the Colonial Office are suggesting to the Foreign Office that Hedjaz should participate in the conference with a view to the settle- -ment of the Kejd-Eedjaz frontier and other outstanding questions. Subject to the concurrence of the Government of India, which is being sought, the conference will be under the presidency of Colonel Knox, who will keep H.M. Government and the High Commissioners fully informed of all developements. The Sheikh of Mo hammerah has expressed his willingness to act as host to the delegates at his palace at Has Ajuza, and the concurrence of the Persian Govt, in this proposal is being sought. ^£0 You will have observed from Bushire telegram No.924 of October 21st that Bin Saud does not propose to attend the conference himself. There will therefore be no question of the personal attendance of Feisal or Abdullah,5^ 5*0 ii. You should inmediately invite Peisal to nominate a representative from the Iraq Government at the conference. The representative should reach. Kuwait no later than Hovemher 22nd ('before which date Knox reports that the conference cannot meet) and should be given full powers to negotiate any outstanding question, subject to ultimate ratification by his Government.

I venture to deprecate most strongly the xs ^ kx suggestion that the discussion as to the revision of the Mohammerah Convention should 'be given definite place on the Kuwait progranime. It is less than a year since the Convention and the Protocol were finally ratified by Feisal and Bin Saud. I can see no grounds for a revision which has certainly never 'been suggested by the Mesopot- -amian Government, nor, in so far as I am aware, by Bin Saud. It appears very dangerous^ deliberately to give Bin Saud an opening for the cancellation of an agreement, which we know he does not altogether like, and the removal of which would most likely lead to active trouble between the Akhwan and the Mesopotamian tribes and give Bin Saud , an opportunity to attempt to win the allegiance of the latter. Bushir.e will please inform Knox, and if possible withold communication to Bin Saud of the suggested item on the agenda of the conference, pending further orders from the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

Information reached King Feisal some days ago that Akhwan forces had penetrated into Hedjaz 'between Medina Sal eh and Medina, about 80 miles from Medini and had broken up some miles of Hedjaz railway. The dispos- -ition of these forces together with the rumours accompanying their march, seems to Peisal to show the design of Bin Saud to force hedja^ tribes between Mecca and Medina to accept allegiance to him, and thus prepare the way for early seizure of Medina. He anticipates that Bin Saud following his usual methods will disavow the raid, but wiil nevertheless secretly appoint one of the local chiefs to be Governor on his behalf, and that the latter having accepted the standard from Bin Saud ' will spread propaganda and seek to bring about a rebellion against King Hussein. Jerusalem telegraphs that the Hedjaz forces have defeated the Akhwan and taken many prisoners and much booty, but this, if true, will probably only stimulate Bin Saud to send fresh forces to take revenge for the defeat. Feisal and the Iraq Government have Written to me urgent letters representing in strong terms the disawt- -rous effect which the seizure of Medina by the Wahabis or serious attempt thereon would have on Moslem sentiment throughout the world, and urging that H.M.Government shall send an imperative message to Bin Saud to refrain from interference of all kinds in the directiop of Hedjaz. If Bin Saud*3 designs are correctly described above, it is obvious that ill-disposed Moslems everywhere especially in India, will lay the whole blaim on11. His Britannic Majesty's Government as being respoBsible • for the recent growth of Bin Baud's power through subsidies etc., and will seize the opportunity to oroduce another outburst of Moslem agitation agaanst Great Britain. I suggest that advantage might be taken of the complete dependency of Hejd upon India and Iraq for supplies of rice and wheat, as was made evident during the period of restrictions on export which followed the war, and that Bin Saud be categorically warned that any infringement of well-known Kedjaz boundaries by Akhwan tribes, whether under his avowed orders or not, will be followed by the immedmate cutting off of supplies. This warning should be especially effective at present, as famine conditions prevail in a great part of lejd. The question would, I presume, be discussed at the approaching conference, if Hussein sends a representative but the indignation produced by Akhwan raids towards Medina seems likely to prevent his sending one, and may even make it difficult to pErsuade the Government of Iraq to send a Representative. * .

It appears doubtful whether Hedjaz represent- -ative can attend the Kuwait Conference owing to the shortness of notice, but King Hussein is being urged to despatch one on the ground that he is more likely to secure a satisfactory frontier at the general discussion where concessions (?) elsewhere may induce Bin Saud to take a reasonable line. The following general policy of H.M. Government is communicated for your guidance and should he adhered to subject to comment to Baghdad or Jerusalem, which should 'be repeated to me. It should 'be kept strictly secret. The frontier of Trans -Jordamia being the front- .-ier of the mandated area of Palestine is the direct concern of H.M. Government. They are prepared to exclude the whole of Wadi Sarhan from Kaf inclusive, and to / allow Hedjaz to extend Northward along the railway as far as Madawwara, provided that Trans-Jordania ha^ access, to the Gulf of Akaba, that ITejd does not encroach upon the Hedjaz railway, and that± Khurma and Taraba are included in Hedjaz. 'hey would accordingly see no objection to the frontier being drawn from/the intersection of meridia . 39 with parallel 32 to the intersection of meridian ^7 with parallel 3li. Thence along meridian 37 to parallel 31. Thence to the intersection of the meridian 38 with parallel 30. Thence along meridian 38 to parallel 29 degrees 35 or point due West of Hefud salient. Thence crossing the Hedjaz railway in the neighbourhood of i— ■ ' '*1 I/udawwara to point on the Gulf South of Akaba. j Por practical purposes the line as ultimately delimited will no doubt follow the natural features, but the above gives, - mrni: 7^ the general direction. AMullah would thus give up Kaf for Akaha. Bin Saud would give up Khurma and Taraha for Kaf, and Hussein would give up any claim to territory ITorth of lludawwipra x for Khurma and Taraloa. You should leave the plenipotentiaries t6 open the discussion themselves, lach party will no doubt commence operations by making extreme demands, 'but I trust you may be able to guide them to the above conclusion. In the event of Hedjaz not being represented, H.M.Govt. will not discuss the Trans-Jordan boundary beyond the Nefud salient, which i^ the point at which they consider- that the Hejd-Hedjaz boundary should take off. The cession of Kaf must i$ this case be conditional majd&amp;m upon a written undertaking from Bin Saud agreeing to the subsequent inclusion of Khurma and Taraba in Hedjaz, if so desired by H.M.Government. xhe above should be communicated to Colonel Knox.

Though they are reluctant to believe such activities as those of Faisal Ibn Dawish have authority or countenance of Sultan if appears to them that the despatch of special mission of this kind to neighbourhood of frontier at present stage will almost in- evitablly lead to local friction which may imperil prospect of permanent settlement. They have been at considerable pains to arrange the meeting which was cordially Telcomed by Sultan in his letter reported by you in October. There are other indications that wishes of H.M. Government do not carry the weight with Ibn Saud that they have a rught to expect in view of the friendly relations which have subsisted for so many years between the two Governments. It would be grave disappointment to them if cause of events were to impair or weaken these relations bftthey cannot acquiesce in the con tinuance of the present state of uncertainty as to the frontiers of Nejd and sphere of activity ofits Ruler. They accordingly regret they are unable to concur in proposed postponment of Gcnference. Their representative will leave Bombay on 6th November and will reach Kuwait during the first weelj of December. They trust that on his arrival he will find Sultan^ representative ready to commence negotiations and that H.M.

In the event of the Nejd representativenot reaching Kuwait by the end of first week in December H^MaaOverrment will be reluctantly compelled to assume Sultan has decided to incur grave displeasure of H»M•Government.

Sven if AMullah's personal views were favourable, it would be difficult for him to agree to the surrender of Eaf in return for Akaba and the territory on the Eedjaz raiIway between Maan and Mudowwarra, as he would lay himself open to accusation of surrendering an important Sherifian post, and also of securing the inclusion in the British'Mandate of territory, which the Arabs consider to belong to Hedjaz.

This settlement is in fact the main ohject of the conference and Bin Saud may well reply that until, the frontier is fixed, it is not clear that any aggression has taken place. He would almost certainly allege counter aggression by the Hashimites and this would mean endless and fruitless controversy which would be more proper at the conference. I do not understand exactly what assurances are demanded against future aggression but idi Faisal means written* promise by Bin Saud I should regard it as useless until perhaps after the Conference. In regard to remaining points I see no objection at present to their discussion at the conference. I presume that Bin Saud's stipulation that each delegate confine his attention to matters concerning the territry of his principal has been accepted and that Faisal will instruct his representative to be careful and not weigh in with suggestions regarding the Hedjaz or Transjordan. If he has not I shall have no alternative but to call him to order. Knoxw 61/15 Telegram P JTrom Colonies To Resident Bushire ( Addressed to Col.

Mullah Hafiz, the second member of Bin Baud's delegation, is an Egyptian journalist notorious as a blackmailer and anti-British agitator and propagandist who has maden the Gulf his base of operations for the last three or four years. He became master of a school at Bahrain in 1921 and in this capacity became Sheifeh Abdullah's right hand man, egging him on to intrigue against his brother the present regent, and communicat- -ing anti-British and anti-Hamad articles to the Egyptian press, particularly to A1 Akhbar, of which paper he is the recognised agent in the Gulf. At the end of 1921 some correspondence passed between the Political Agent and myself regarding the feasibility of transferring him to some other field of activity^ he got wind of this and left hastily for Kuwait. On return -ing in 1922, he was not allowed to land at Bahrain at the special requesi of Sheikh Isa. Since then he has made Kuwait his headquarters, writing anti-British articles denouncing the A.P.O.C. etc. About August or September he applied to be allowed to return to Bahrain, ostensibly to collect debts; this was allowed on conditi -ion that he did not mix up in politics. He abused this concession and the Political Agent was contemplating indicating to him the advisability of quitting the island, when he suddenly left for Qatar, to agitate there in favour of Sheikh Isa, Receiving no encourage- -ment he left for Riyadh about November to try Bim Baud. Prom all sources, including Sheikh Hamad, I hear that firit this is his^visit to Riyadh,11. His sudden reappearance in Bahrain on the 7th December as one of Bijj Saud f s delegation naturally excited remark and very unfavourable comment, as everybody knows klvOkV his history and that he does not the first thine about A ITejd or its frontiers. I beg to surest therefore that His Majesty^ Govt, might object to his sitting in the conference; the ITejd delegation is amply sufficient without him. Further that I may be authorised to write to Bin Saud, saying that Mullah Hafiz has been known to me for some years, giving some particulars about him, expressing my astonishment at his selection and adding that I am sure that H.M.Goverment cannot possibly recognise him as representing His Highness, I could add that I feel sure that His Highness (possibly owing to short acquainance) could not have realised the sort of man lullah Hafiz is when appointing him, and express the hope that Bin Saud will see the propriety of removing him form the Hejd delegation. This has been delayed for days owing to my having to wait till I returned to Headquarters. I am forwarding a copy of this by post to Colonal Knox, who knows most of the above information.

Beyond general obstruction, of which we are sure to have plenty, he will hardly know what to oppose, as he v cannot possibly know anything of Government's policy in' matters in dispute, in which they are only concerned as general well -wishers, disposed to peace and quietness. To refuse to accept him would annoy the Sultan and probably arouse his suspicions. He does not strike me yet as an important member ofthe deputation, ana it is doubtful if he can,have any personal ascendency over Bin Saud, whom he can hardly have seen. Saiyid Eamzah and Ahdullah Effendi will he likely to keep him in order, and he can only he danger- -ous as a martyr to British suspicion. You may rely on me to keep Bahrain out of i-he discussion, and I think it would he hect to leave Hafiz alone. The above is with reference to your telegram Ho.1156 of 15th December.

It is a great nuisance about the Hedjaz delegates not coming. I am afraid it will make all my work rather useless but K-ing Husain seems from all accounts, even those of the Iraq ^nd Trans Jordan delegates^to be a perfectly hopeless person. Of course it has turned the heads of all these people to be suddenly elevated from a very obscure position as gh/rif\ and sons of the Sh^rif^ in Mecca to be Kings and Potentates and they ought to have been firmer in the very beginning and explained to them that they had no right whatever to speak in the name of tiie whole of that I agree with them, though I hold no brief for Zion, about the $ Palestine question in the Morning Post which More ha/ been kind enough to lend me. King Husain seems to have a good deal of backing among the conservative party and his envoy, Asil Beg,seems to have a good press in England. This probably helps on Husain* s aagl -omanla it just gives Die time to add my greetings for X'mas and the Hew Year to those ^ which my wife sent yesterday to Mrs. Trevor, I hope this letter will catch the mail to Bushire and Yours sincerely, P.T.O.To The Hon'ble Lieut :Col.A.P.Trevor,G.S.I.C.I.E, t Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.61/15.

' (l) I concur in the'proposal, that Sabih should pay a flying visit to Baghdad to consult Peisal. I trust, as your telegram suggests, that his visit may lead to a suitable arrangement in regard to the Shammar. Failing that i am inclined, having regard t ok . the written undertaking given by the Iraq Secretariat Council, (reported in Baghdad telegram ITo.719 of December 25th) that the Shammar would be expelled if they {mutilated)-ed, again to consider that the 'political arrangement' suggested by Peisal and reporte -ed in Baghdad telegram ITo. 720 should take the .form of a promise to (?fulfil) this undertaking in the event of a recurrence of large scale raiding. (2) In case of small raids' by irresponsible tribal elements, it is a matter for consideration whether the extradition of individual offenders would act as the best deterrent. x (3) With regard to the fifth Iraq point, I must leave you to make the best arrangements you can. I do not see how in practice it would be possible to secure attendant (?) families and cattle in the contingency of \ Hedjaz.

You should take-the opportmnity afforded 'by your visit to Amman to urge King Hussein to make immediate arrangements to send a representative to the Kuwait conference, in which case consideration of ITejd-Hedjaz affairs would be postponed as suggested by Peisal. You / should represent strongly to King Hussein the folly of let^ -ting slip the chance of settling outstanding differences with ITejd, and thus eliminating the risk of further mhabi aggression against Eedjaz. You should make it plain to him that H.M.Governm- —ent can accept no responsibility for anji untoward cohseQ.u— -ences that may result, for which he will have only himself t c thank. You should endeavour to enlist Abdullah^ support for the purpose in view, and should point out to King Hussein that Feisal favours Hedjaz participation in the conference, as shown in Baghdad telegram Ho.720.

For this reason His Grace is inclined to the vit that no specific action should ht taken by His Majesty's Government in the direction of limiting or discountenancing the pilgrimage -ontil they are in a 'position to publish, in answer to r)ossible criticism, irrefutable evidence that iiiej have done all in their mmr to secure an improvement in the conditions -which aro mr causing no -iuch distress and suffering to British ae well as to other pilgrims in the Hejes.

This decision is regretted by both the Najd and 'Iraq en voys, and they suggest the alternative of adjourning the Conference until 18th January, which will allow the 'Iraq authorities on points raised in the course of the discus sion, and to return to complete the agreement.

I am af aid that, unless the principle of extradition of individual raiders is accepted and less stress placed' on tribal hospitality by Iraq, there will be continued discontent and frivtion with Arab, rulers, such as the Sheikh of Mohammerah and Bin Baud. I would su&lt;^ est that the first steps in civilisation demand:- (a) Break up .such tribal hospitable customs, which only lead to friction, and (b) Cooper tion among rulers to coerce unruly refugee - subjects. It is too early yet to allow the lack of regular -ly constituted courts of Justice to obstruct the justness of unruly tribesmen, though I a^ree with Feisal^ point of view in para 4 as regards ordinary criminals, and endorde the proposal to drop the ordinary extradition treat ' Regarding para 2, I trust that it may. be'possible t secure the consent of Nejd and,, if so, 3 seems satis- -factory; so also is 5. 6 will, I think, meet Hejd views.

I have heard from certain sources that the sioverninent of % Hejaz has refused to send representatives to the Conference at Kuwait but I do not know whetner this is correct or not. What makes me to think tnat this news is correct is because the Government of He.jaz is mobilising and has sent out oi Medina an expedition' under the command of Sherif Bhahadh and according to tne lauest news which I have received tney are camping at Haraimal near the border. The Government of He.jaz continue to send reinforcements to them as also large number of Arabs of those parts are joining them. This matter has made me suspicious about the indent ions of the Government of He.jaz at this time when, at the request of H.M f s Bri^seeh Government, I have ceased hostilities and sent strict orders to all my subjects to refrain from transgressing the boundary of He.jaz and (aggressing) its subjects. If it be orue tnat the Government of He.jaz nas refused to send represenoatives to the Conference at Kuwait and is engaged in t / mobilization and hostile movements, she will oeruainly commit hostilities in my boundary and against my subjects w-hich. this nas caused me to bring tne maooer to the notice of the British Government and ask for a definite explanation and undertaking tnat the Government of Hejaz will not transgress (vn my boundary), Or I shdvlS not be responsible for anything which may happen. I request you to telegraph the substance of this to the — quarter concerned in London asking for a reply as soon as possible.

Dear Trevor, ^ecanber 19th, 1923. lu.j. &gt;V_ . r OilflfitlllA. ll-v-ROi Your telegram of December 18th (nmber indecypherable). fou must be thinking us very slack, to judge from your telegram, but I hope to show you that we are not guilty. There has never been the faintest chance of your getting a Hejaz representative at the Koweit Conference. Hussein twice refused, the second time on November 10th and the Foreign Office were duly informed. Apparently the Colonial Office failed to inform you. Later they asked me to make another try unless I thought it would mean another rebuff. I said it w ould mean another rebuff - in a telegram to Foreign Office dated December 8th (No.59), repeated to you. (You are on the list as having the cypher in which that message was sent). Finally, getting frantic at Knox's telegrams, which showed ignorance of the essential point weeks after he ought to have been informed, I wired to him in code to say there was no hope of a Hejaz representative going to Koweit. That was on December 17th. * As he must have got my telegram by now I am not answering you priority Lieut --Colonel A.P.Trevor, C.S. I., C. I .S., Political Resident, BUSHIRE.ni Kc. 27.

Bin^Saud, writing 3rd January, says that he hears that Hedjaz has declined to send delegates to the Kuwait conference. He says that he is inclined to think the news true, as Hedjaz are mobilising men under Sharif Shahadh at Haraimal. He protests against this at ar. time when at the urgent request of H.M.Government he has ordered his sub -jects not to cross the frontier or commit'acts of aggression against the Hddjaz. He demands an explanation and undertaking from Hedjaz not to cross his frontier or molest his subjects, or failing this, he disclaims all responsibility for results.

Najd tribes wishing to enter 'Iraq should only be allowed to do so on thsir giving a sub stantial guarantee In money or cattle that they will abstain from raiding.

Nejd envoys say that they are absolutely bound by their instructions and quite unable to sign anything, unless this point at issue, vital to them, is conceded or their instructions are modified. forward in your telegrajn No.25 dated i^th January, which the Iraq delegate accept®, (b) the suggestion that they record the measure of agreement arrived at, and a reasoned statement by both sides on the two points at issu», where agreement has been found impossible, and (c) I have even gone so far as to propose arbitration by H «M *Gr ©vernment. awkward position, as the Sultan of Nejd has drastic methods of dealing with delegates who exceed their instructions. me as President a joint letter in which they state that as preliminary agreement has been arrived at on all points except the return of the refugee tribesman and nothing more can be usefully discussed here unless and until their instructions are modified, they propose an adjourmment of the conference until March 5th to permit the envoys to explain the position fully to their principals. March 5th I have placed before them (a) the solution put They will sign nothing, and are indeed in an Both parties have however signed and submitted to11. March 5lh seems too long, February 2^th (? would be better). \ Further discussicn is really useless, and the representative of Iraq, is clamouring to go bac|: by the next mail. Until the delicate situation pending, as disclosed by Eushire telegram No.6 of January 12th, and with negot- -iations just commenced at Ammaja, I consider his immediate departure without agreement reached most' impolitic and dangerous, and am telling him I cannot ak take the respons- -ibility upon myself of permitting it. His presence here is necessary to keep the conference alive. When the Trans- Jordamia envoy returnsand the situation has further cleared, I concur that the Iraq envoy might be allowed to return and think that 1st February might be a suitable date. In the meantime, I shall endeavour to keep them occupied in preparing (b) above, whether they sign or not. I propose also to write to the sultan myself, giving! full explanation of the Iraq position regarding the fefugee tribesmen, and your solution of the difficulty.

I strongly support Feisal's proposal that the Sulatan of Nejd should be induced to send a representative to balance Zaid. I do so the more readily, as we had yesterday in full conference a second instance of bad breach of faith on the part of the Nejd representatives, who, although I have not yet communicated to them the substance of your telegram No.33 of January Igth, have completely resiled from their promise on the strength of which Subih Bey went and consulted the Government of Iraq as to whether they would be bound by the evidence of sir Percy Cox as to pre-Ojair plunder. They say now that, whatever the evidence of Cox may be, they cannot abandon their claim which is ■ based on other grounds than the promise of Cox alone. They had .already in the same connection gone back o# an undertaking that the matter should be decided by the proposed tribal tribunal, and I had considerable difficulty in psxsiuiilKg pacifying the Iraq envoy, who was prepared to say that nothing could be done With negotiators who said one thing today and another tomorrow. They have now played the same trick on me, and I think Bin Saud should be pressed to change them. The above is with reference to Baghdad telegram No.52 of January 2 i fth. Knox.61/15. Knox, Kuwait.

I repeat following telegram from Jerusalem for your inforiration:- 'King Hussein consents to senifi Amir Zeid now at Baghdad to the Kuwait conference as his representative, but with instructions to maintain the King^s previous position with regard to return to pre-war boundaries (?) of Arab States. This step was secured with much difficulty, and any modification of these instructions had better be propos ed at a later stage. The King undertakes not to attack Bin Saud unless first attacked by him. In that case he would defend himself. King Hussein will renain at Amman for some days and wishes to discuss other subjects later. He does not desire to visit Jerusalem.

My letters to Bin Saud regarding the present stage the matters in dispute have reached and regarding parallel 32 will go on January 3 1 «t. and copies will be sent to Bushire (despatch to which they form enclosures leaves me for Your Grace today). I could write a thttd letter explaining the difficulties in regard to the second breach of faith committed by the Nejd delegates, which Trevor could use at his discretion, as also the fact that Said Hsuuzah the President is a fugitive from justice in Eedjaz, has served Ibn Rashid if not others before Bin Saud. and commands the confidence of noone. He might facilitate matters, also usefully comment on the selection of Mullah Hafiz, welil known to be presona ingrata to the Britiwh, a fact of which he may be unaware.In any casa, Palcstin#, Baghdad and Trans- -JordaAia might tak« note that it is hardly likely that the presence of their representatives will be of any use until March Ist, as it is almost certain that it willi take all February to bring the- Sultan to the stage to which the High •Commissioner for Palestine contrived to bring King Hussein the other day.

I have seen Mullah HaflZ, who returned to Kuwait yesterday. In the prasence of Abdullah Effendl and the Secretary of the Nejd delegatloia. He Informed me that at first Bin s*ud asked why Hedjaz affairs should he confuted with those of Trans-Jordania. But in considerfctlon of the fact that the proposal came not from Trans-Jordania but from the British Representative, he replied as follows (1) He is in practical possession of the Wadi Sarhan, except the salt villages, which he has only deffer- -ed capturing because the British Government expressed the wish. (2) Therefore the price suggested for the abandonment of Khurma Turaba and Khaibar is insufficient, but he would be prepared to abandon Turaba Mi, or consent to Turaba and Khaibar being made independent buffer states , but in no case aan he give up Khurma. (3) This concession however would depend on King Hussein undertaking not to interfere in affaire of iUir, and to abandon Qunfldhah. He should further acknow ledge the territories of Nejd accordlngto the Mohammarah Convention as Iraq has done. (Note. I do not follow this exactly, but it probablymeans official recognition by Hussein of the Sultaiiate of Nejd and its dependencies.) in conclusion, Hafia said he was bearer of fuller powers for the Nejd delegation. I made no comment on the above merely saying that I would communicate the reply to my Government. The above refers to my telegram No.^-l 2Sth Deer, Knox.61/15. I Telegram P. From Reiident, Bushire. To Knox, Kuwait, No•172• Dated 3 let January 192^. Does the information givtn by Mullali Hafiz modify the views contained in your .telegram No.S^ Ha ® Bi]a Saud refused to send a representative to kalance Zaid? I should have thought it was in his own interest to do so. It seems to me that we should have objected to Bin Saud 1 s delegation at the start when it included such persons as said Hamzah and Mullah Hafis. I suppose the ©bjection to your going to Ojair is that meeting Bin Saud might be regarded by the other delegates as likely to impair your impartiality? Otherwise you are au fait with the whole question and I am Hot. This refers to your telegram No,57.

It is between the Political Residency at Bushire, the Political Agencies at Kuwait and Bahrain, the High Commissioners in Baghdad and Jerusalem, the Colonial Office in London, the British Agency at Jeddah, the Government of India, Sheikh Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, ruler of Kuwait, Ibn Sa'ud, Sultan of Najd, King Faisal of Iraq, and Amir Abdullah of Transjordan.The main aim of the conference was to settle issues of border delineation between Najd, Transjordan, the Hejaz, and Iraq. Other issues of negotiation were the return of Shammar refugees to Najd from Iraq and compensation for past raids. Much of the correspondence deals with this. The discussion focuses around the status of places that there is most disagreement on: Wadi Sirhan (Jauf [Jawf], Kaf [Kāf]), Akaba [al-‘Aqaba], and Maan [Ma‘ān]. Other more practical arragments are also discussed. Such as costs, accommodation, and attendees.Prominent in the volume are the following subjects:the involvement of Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah;rumours of Ikhwan raids into the Hejaz;King Hussein's refusal to attend or send a delegate;British dissaproval of Hafiz Wahba as a representative of Najd;the threat of Faisal al-Dawish attacking Medina.The volume covers up until the adjournment of the conference, including arrangements for the second phase of negotiations.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ikhwan, military and religious brotherhood</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Palestine and Transjordan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Hejaz Ḥusayn bin 'Alī al-Hāshimī</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Iraq Fayṣal I</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Stuart George Knox</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Hakim of Kuwait Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Emir of Mohammerah Khaz'al bin Jābir bin Mirdāw al-Ka'bī</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Fayṣal bin Sulṭān al-Dawīsh</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Jordan ʿAbdullāh I</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Hafiz Wahba</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Shammar (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Transjordan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kāf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Maan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Al Jawf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Al 'Aqaba</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000237#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
