On some requests the destination and consignee is not specified, and is marked instead as ‘sailing under sealed orders’. Included amongst the licence requests are some export licences which were cancelled and sent back to the Political Agency. These licences typically have the word ‘cancelled’ written across them in blue or red pen, or bear a stamp marking them as cancelled. The file also contains some letters from representatives of Gray, Mackenzie and Company, relating to requests made for licences by BAPCO.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company, Chief Local Representative</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Petroleum industry</topic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum products</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00004c#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00004c#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00004c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
