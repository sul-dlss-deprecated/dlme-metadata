Dated Simla, the 17th August 1911. Sir, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 25th June 1911, forwarding a draft revised Commercial Treaty, drawn tp by His Highness the Sultan of Kasfcat, with notes and comments thereon by the Political Agent, Maskat, 2. The alterations in the draft treaty are numerous. They extend to nearly all the articles of that instrument and in their combined effect seriously modify many provisions in the existing commercial treaty. 3. It is observed, however, from your telegram, dated the 28th July 1911, that the Sultan's proposals were framed before His Highness had received a translation of the revised draft as approved by His Majesty's Government,(a copy of which accompanied the letter from the Government of India in the Foreign Department H0.4464-E.3. (Confidential), dated the 6th December 19o5) ; and you have already instructed the Political Agent to resubmit proposals based on the British, revised draft, and you anticipate that many of the Sultan's suggestions will be eliminated by an exchnage of views. pending the result of these further negotiations, it may he well to indicate the ohanges essential to meet the objectionable alterations in the draft proposed by the sultan, and it is neces sary that the earliest opportunity should be taken by the Politi cal Agent to discuss them with the Sultan, unless His Highness is prepared to accept the British draft practically as it stands. In soso doing the Political Agent mast be guided in matters of detail by his own judgment; but the following statement of the views entertained by the Government of India on the wider issues will indicate the amendments to which his efftsfta should generally be directed* 4. As regards Article I, it is understood from the political Agent's observations, that no difficulty is anticipated in remedy ing the defects brought to Article H. The Government of India entertain serious objection to the use of the word 'kings' and to the omission of the protection clause. It is desirable to adhere to the phraseo logy 'subjects of His Britannic Majesty' x * x and 'subjects of native States in India under the protection of His Britannic Majesty'• The insertion of the words 'the subjects or c/itieens of Maskat or Oman' is held to be important, and should be pressed in order to ensure national as well as most favoured nation treat ment. His Highness's emendations of 'most tavoured nation treat ment in Articles II. Ill and VI are obscure, as observed by Major Enox. Every effort should be made to secure the adoption of the ordinary form of most favoured nation clause in commercial treaties. Article III* The words 'after permission and publication from either aide to the oth.r- ahoaia h. ..Itted, »o auoh ra.txiotioa eat,,. 1. the Fr»oh treat,. »a 1» re-adjaatin, Britiah r.l.ti.a, Madkat, Brltiah iatera.t. there oanr.t he plated oa a footing inferior/that of France* Article IV. The the additi ° n ' eX ° ePt Pla ° e8 x x x shall he after permission' should he urged. Failing this, the addition may be accepted, the reservation suggested by the Political Agent in note (1) to this article ling made* .he word. 'Under th. .... condition, in .U ** ihjeota of their re.p.otiw. .onntri..'. whloh haw. Bean onit- sl .nd which ar. r.f.rred to h, th. Balitioal auant in not.© (2) to this article, should he included in pursuance of the attempt to secure national as well as most favoured nation treatment. The Government of India approve the remarks and suggestions in note (4) that there should he separate articles dealing with intoxicants and warlike material, and that the maximum duty should he named. The precise phraseology of the article dealing with warlike material may, however, he appro priately reserved until the instructions of Hie Majesty's Government are received regarding the proposed negotiations with the Sultan for the general control of the arms traffic. Ihs Government of India attach importance to the sentence 'tka coasting trade of Easkat and Oman shall remain open to British vessel which has been omitted, and it should he pressed. The last clause of this article which is commented on hy the Political Agent in note (6) cannot he allowed to stand. Its retention would defeat the object of the treaty. Article T. in the interests of British trade, a time limit notion should he taken on the lines suggested is necessary, and action snouxu by the Political Agent in his notes to this article. Article YI. It is observed that in Article VI of the revised draft treaty approved hy His Majesty's Government, the word -custom- was omitted before -duties or taxes- in the second aentenoe of that draft. Apparently the intention of HI. -l. ,«■«• ‘ M .0, ««P« **&gt;*• ■«*• *&gt;» 1 ‘ &gt; “ 1 thi. 1 . oppo.4 to tt« intention ot the nevi.od 4 rn« .toeo to. If the Saif “ “ * * +. nraotical importance in the interests of trade matter of great practical mpo v ns ho specified in the treaty and action that the taxation should he specifies should he token as proposed hy Major Knox in note Article. The clmise suggested in note (IB) should likewise Be inserted. Bor the rest, the Government of India concur Knox's suggestions. in MajorArticle VII* This article is very obscure. The last sentenoe stultifies the first and must in any case he delted. It would also be desirable to omit the second sentence and to amend the first as proposed by Major Knox. Article VIII. The expression, 'His Majesty', as applica ble to the Sultan is open to serious objection in a treaty with the British Government . In various parts of this draft treaty, and in all earlier British and French treaties, the expression used is 'Eis Highness'. The Sultan should be advised to adhere to uniformity and to the style of 'His High ness', under which his independence has been guaranteed. The word 'approve' in this article is preferable to 'appoint' and should if possible be substituted. Article II. Frovision is made f*ee the payment of duty in cash, or in goods, or in produce should it be possible to levy the tax in this way. A reform of the Maskat currency has been recognized in the past as a measure of considerable importance. Something may be effected in this direction by rendering duty payable in coin which is legal tender in British India, unless payment is otherwise arranged by common consent of the trader and the customs authorities. This part of Article II should therefore be altered to corres pond with the wording of the draft revised treaty of 1905 already referred to. In view of Major Knox’s remarks, the last clause of this article should also be recast so as to agree with the revised draft treaty above referred to. Article I. The efficient execution of the provisions referred to in notes (1) and (2) of the Political Agent would depend entirely upon the good will with which Hie Highness might carry then, into effect. His Highness should be remind ed that the British Government are animated with a sincere desire to foster trade with Maskat, and that for this purpose the draft article ae accepted by Eis Majesty’s Government is most suitable. The provision regarding standard scales and weightsweights should also be inserted. The proviso proposed by Major Knox in note (4) of this article is mnsultablo for a treaty and might ; if you consider it desirable, form the subject of an exchange of notes. Article XI. It is very necessary that the provisos mentioned in note (2) by the Political Agent, should, as far as possible , be removed. The wording of the provision regarding salvage is obscure. The correct expression is rights of salvage” as in the existing treaty. Article JLII. The second clause is not at all clear* It apparently sets up a claim of reciprocity as to which there is nothing in the existing treaty or in the revised draft of 1905. The Government of India agree with Major Knox that the clause is thoroughly objectionable. Should, however, it be eventually considered desirable to grant reciprocity as to which your opinion is invited, I am to pointput that the general provisions of section 238 of the British Merchant Shipping Act, and section 63 of the Indian Ports Act, provide for surrender from British territory without distinction of country 'on proof of desertion', and an Order in Council would be necessary to apply the former section to Maskat. Before, however, ooming to a decision on this point, the obscurity of the article should be cleared up. Article XIII. The Government of India concur in the Political Agent*© remarks* Article XIT* The words 'in which the lex talionis x x x is necessary' should be deleted. They do not appear in the French Treaty. The provision made at the end of this article regarding protection to British subjects in the service of His Highness is impossible. Ho such provision exists in the French Treaty. Article XY. In the interests of Commerce, it is essential to maintain the provision in the revised draft of 19o5, that the English Bankruptcy Law should apply. Article XVI. The exception^as it stands, is undesirable. The substitution of a clause on the lines of clause 2 of ArticleXVI of the British revised draft would he useful* The government of India concur in Lajor Knox’s comments* Articles XVII to XXI and XXIII. Call for no remarks* Article XXII* The GrOvemment of India are unable to concur in the Political Agent's opinion that it is unnecessary to insist that, in case of doubt as to interpretation, the English text shall be decisive* It is a cardinal principle that, in dealing with oriential potentates, treaties and agreements must be executed in English and the English version must prevail. 5* The Government of India desire that every effort should be made to induce His Highness to accept, in its entirety, the British revised draft of 1905* Failing this negotiations may be continued with His Highness on the lines above indicated* I have, etc., Sd/- E.E.S.Clarke, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India*TELEGRAM P* From - The politioal Resident in the Persian Gulf, lo -— The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department* Demi-cffioial* Dated and Reed* 28th July 1911. Please refer to your demi-official telegram dated 24th inst* The Sultan’s draft treaty which I sent to you proved to have been written before he had received translation of our revised draft* His proposed modifications had not been subjected to digestion and discussion and alterations were uncertain in regard to many points both of object and language* I expect that many of his suggestions will be eliminated as result of of them, or because they will place us in a worse position than the French under corresponding articles of their treaty. I have been obliged to direct the politioal Agent to resubmit papers on basis of our revised draft, after reducing Sultan’s proposals » to more crystalised from by discussion with His Highness* It is difficult A to get access to the Sultan at this season and if pushed too much he beoomes intractable, so that time must be allowed* Does Secretary of State need urgently the complete draft of all articles or only Sultan*s ideas regarding certain particular articles ? In latter case, if I could be informed uhioih they were and what it la that H.M’s Gorerment desirejto effect. Saltan's final views on those items oould be axrlted at and submitted in advance of complete papers. It is probable that completion of papers mi^-t be expedited by my gping down to Muscat myself for some time, but in that case it would be difficult to avoid discussion with Eis Highness various arms traffic issues and I should prefer, if possible, to avoid that until I know the deoision of Government in connection with my recent proposals in this respect„ Others are inadmissible on the face\\ 1Q11 j 5_ I o « I [Demi-opficial, Dated the 25th June 1911. From— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—E. H. S. Clarke, Esq., C.I.E., Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. The post from Maskat brings me the enclosed papers in duplicate, demi- officially, from Knox—the Sultan’s primary ideas of what the new Treaty should be. I have not been able to assimilate the contents in time to make any comment by this mail, and indeed a superficial look through the papers makes me fear that the subject is not yet in a sufficiently advanced state to be dealt with satisfactorily. It may be useful, however, for you to have the Sultan’s draft ideas in advance, so that any particular subject can, if necessary, be commented upon by telegram. I fear the negotiations promise to take some time and the Sultan to be stupid over it, but I hesitate to comment seriously without studying the papers further.

His Highness has, so far, shown no sign of a desire to speed up negotiations.Translation (with notes) by Major Knox, Political Agent, Maskat, of draft Treaty, prepared by His Highness the Sultan of Maskat on tbe 15th May 1911, and handed over by him to Consular Dragoman to place before the Political Agent, Maskat. THE NEW TREATY. Article 1. The treaty concluded between The British Government (1) and Saijid Faisal bin Turki bin Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Maskat and Oman. And this treaty, now concluded in the year 1339-H ., Cancels all treaties that preceded it , (2) and at the time of exchange of ratifications, shall replace them. Note. —His Highness has here confused pre amble and nrst article. 1 anticipate no difficulty here in bringing him round to our point of view. As regards underlined portion (1) I pointed out to His Highness that the direct treaty with His Ma.jesty was an honour that he should not 1 ightl y forego and he seemed to accept my view. As regards underlined portion (2) I pointed out to His Highness that the wide terms of this cancella tion rendered it impossible to accept, and he said that the defect would be remedied. Article 2. That, in virtue of this treaty, the subjects of the Indian Kings, (1) who have treaty relations with the British Government, shall be considered as subjects of the aforesaid Great Government also. And all subjects of the British Government shall be permitted to enjoy, throughout all the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat with reference to commerce and navigation and the exercise of trades and professions, as in every other respect, all the rights, immunities and protection of eveiy nature which they possess, or enjoy, or which may be practised in future they shall en joy them, (2) or which may be granted in the future to the subjects of the great Govern ments and their subjects: and, especially, there shall not be upon them duties, taxes, or conditions, or responsibilities of whatsoever nature more than what may be upon others (3) or upon the subjects of the great glorious Governments (4) and their people now or in the future. Notes. —(1) I think the use of the word “ King s ” and the omission of the protection claus e will be considered decidedly objectionable . Sedi tious Indian advisers seem to have been at work here and it is a piece of gratuitous imperti nence on His Highness's part to criticize our relations w ith Native States in India which ia no wa y concern him. (2) Arabic here obscure, and neither my Dragoman nor myself could follow it so as to2 make an exactly logical English translation. If; should, however, present no difficulty in alteration and correction. It is proba bly careless drafting and nothing else. _ (3) Rather vague. I do not yet know what His Highness^ views may be on the interpolation &lt;f the subjects or citizens of Maskat or Oman.” It seems to me to have its inconveniences in c onjunction with the wide word ing from “ as, in every etc., whatsoever nature ”, andT should be glad to know if its retention is considered of serious importance. (4) His High ness's emendation of “most favoured nation ”, of which value is doubtful. I should propose to tell him that “ most favoured nation , and its translation, t are well known diplomatic phrases of which every diplomat thoroughly understands the signification, and that it would be dangerous to alter them. His Highness asked me the meaning thereof and seemed su s picious about it, thinkin g thatlt referred to Christian Governments and was a slur on non-Christian (iovernments. I ex plained to him that this was not the case an d think there will be no difficulty here. Article III. Each of the two High Contracting Parties acknowledges (1) the right of the other to appoint Consuls in its territories, after permission and publication from either side to the other, (2) wheT- ever the interests of commerce may require the presence of such officers, and the aforesaid Consuls shall be considered, in the country in which they reside, on the footing of the Consuls of all the glorious Governments (3) in their rank. Each of the High Contracting Parties further agree to permit his own subjects to be appointed to Consular offices by the other Contracting Party: provided always that the persons so appointed shall not begin to act without the previous approbation of the Sovereign whose subjects they may be. The public functionaries of either Government residing in the dominions of the other shall enjoy the same privileges, immunities, and exemptions which are enjoyed within the same dominions by similar public functionaries of other countries. (4) Note (1) “ reciprocally ” omitted, but practically allowed for, m the way Article is worded i n th' Arabic. I could probably arrange for a closer adap tation to the English. (2) Most objectionable interpolation. P rob ably introduced with the very object of defeaii~ when occasion offers, the privilege established b v the Article. * 1 1 ■■ (3j Fide note (4) to Article II. (4) From “ Each of the High Contracting Parties ^ to end of Article, 1 hava followed draft Antreaty as sense 1 b maintained thrmighoiit, though verbal adaptations bringing Arabic translation closer to English seem to me advisable. Article IV. There shall be perfect freedom of commerce and navigation between the two High Contracting Parties ; and each shall allow the subjects of the other to enter all ports, creeks, and rivers belong ing to the two Governments, with their vessels and carg oes except places in a state of war or in which there is danger to life or property on account of want of security in those parts. Then the entry to those part s shall be after permission. (1) And to the subjects of both parties there shall be license to travel, and pursue commerce and trade, whether wholesale or retail, in each others’ dominions, and therein to hire, purchase or possess houses, warehouses, and shops, and stores, and lands. (2) And also it shall be lawful for the subjects of the two High Parties (3) everywhere, that they shall buy, barter, sell—and that direct, or by means of agents—all kinds of merchandise, articles of import, or native production, for sale in th eir respective countries (3) or for transport to foreign countries, except intoxicants an d warlike m aterial. Then itls~ for the Sultan of Maskat or fo r his naib the license or prohibition of their import or of their sale throughout his dominions. (4) And it is lawful to them also that they should consult on the fixing of the price of all such goods and produce with their owner or his agent without the smallest interference on the part of the officials of the Highness of both Parties (5) and to His Highness the Sultan is reserved the privilege and mono poly in all that pertains to^commerce^and P rofits Native produce throughout his dominions. (6) taxes ^ ; Note (1). This gives a handle for constant int erference and though a natural enough pro vision. if we were sure that it would be reasonably used, mi ght be most embarrassing in practise. It would, if it was to be seriously considered, have to be coupled with a reservation making an excep- tion in favour of British_subjects^domio iled^in^£he place in a state ol: war or insecurity. Otherwise, at ever y Bedouin equable— and it is believed that half Oman is in a permanent state of insecurity Ignat, if not of war, ifritish subjects might be prevented from going to look after tbeir families prnpprtv when these were in the greatest danger. * No doubt the real object of the exce^T tion is to give His Highness a pretext to oppose all travelling by European travellers, and especially Government agents, which he regards with the greatest fear and suspicion. (21 The new additi on is naturally left out, as His High ness did not know of it, when this draft trea ty was prepared. I have so far had no oppor tunity of learning His Highness s views on this jiew proviso, I do not^aD^ticipatc^any^gr cat^diffi^~ culty.4 (3) The alteration here appears to be due to offended “amour propre ” and I see no great object ion to it. - f4) This is a move in the right direction, but the exception should not be pitchforked into the middle of Article IV, where it disturbs the sense of what follows. It should come in a separate article, and it would be better perhaps if one article ^[g£ g_jtegoted_to_jntoxicants and the maximum duty n amed. I woul d suggest that it might then ^£_ £^2^id£dj^pecjar*boarT , TF'the~*innT^onteri^ P |^t£d_Jn_ArticIes^ VIII and XIX would be the best arrangement to deal with the situation. The difficultiesjvould be great, but not insuperable. The question of warlike material wo uld require to be dealt with similarly. It seems to me that it would be advantageous to h ave an article denouncing the arms trade and expressing a hope that a board might be created to deal w ith this^difficu|t^8ituati() n^^The_objects_to_be pursued being a high increase of the duty and strict control oli both sale and ex port. (5) The paragra p h re co asting trade is omitted. Remarks in note (2) to this article ap ply. (6) His Highness probably does not understand the full significance of his alteration, and it may be difficult to get him to do so. He probablf misunderstood the paragraph in the old treaty of 1891 and thought it an encroachment op his sovereign rights. I presume that a clause so destructive of the entire treaty must be absolutely vetoed. ' Aeticle V. British subjects shall be permitted, throughout the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, to acquire land, houses and property of every descrip tion, whether moveable or immoveable, and that by way of gift, purchase, or intestate succession, or by will, or in other legal manner, but all that after information to His Highness th; Sultan, or his Naib, .and license from them both, m that, tney may enjoy it freely and at their own choice by way of sale, barter, gift or otherwise accordino- to their desire and, when they desire, in laying a foundation, that is, ip building on the roads and highways, except it may be an innovation or new. ^^£ bat_case^_before_laying out a foundation, it is necessary for them to give news to the Gove rn ment of the Sultan tor the sake of lookmg into the matter and fixing the limits. (2). (1) As worded seems impossible. Informatio n would be the limit. At present, British subjects are required to register all new acquisitions aii? transfers of landed property of which the info rm- ation is probably what is required by the Sul tan's officials. The utmost that would be expected would be that British subjects should pay tffie &lt;lgP y in g i ee3 lor a copy of each such registration, which His Britannic Majesty’s Consul would then furnish to His Highness.5 &amp; (2 ) This would be reasonable enough, if one could be sure oil being guarded against frivolous objections and delays. The danger presumably is British subje cts encroaching on public lands and it is likely enough that they dp. The concession might be made provided that^a^rinie^huu^i.,^ ^ 21 days, were fixed after notice given for the se ttlement ol the case by His Highness's court, at hearin g and decision of which Consul or his representative should attend! His Hignness the Sultan shall be permitted to levy a duty of entry, not exceeding 5 per cent on the value of all goods and merchandise (1), imported by sea from foreign countries into His Highness’s dominion s, except intoxicants in whic h he shall have liberty to take more than th e tax aforesaida£dtoprobibit_the_salethei£ofa^ to grant licenses. (2) This duty shall be paid at that port in H^s Highness’s dominions where the goods are first landed ; and, on payment thereof, such goods shall be exempt in the matter of thi s tax, but should such goods be transferred through* out all t he markets and towns, then they shall not be exe mpt from the warehouse taxes of those markets and towns. (3) And there shall not be demanded from British subjects any import ^ tax exceeding the tax that is levied on the subjects and citizens of the greatest nations’ countries (4). (5) and (6). As for the merchandise and goods, of which the desti nation is a foreign port, (7) and which are transhipped from one vesssl to another in any of the ports of His Highness the Sultan, or which have been for this purpose provisionally landed and deposited temporarily (i) in one of the Sultan’s custom houses to await the arrival of a vessel for reshipment to a foreign port; then, when the merc handise had been so landed , they shall not be exempt from duty, except when the consignee or his agent; shall have, on the arrival, of the vessel so statTd and deposited those goods aforesaid for safe enstody in the custom house and has given intimation that they are landed for transhipment to another ship, and of the name of the port to whi ch the merchandise is to be exported then they shall be exempt from the special tax, but not from the warehouse dues (9). And. hke- wise, those goods shall not be exempt, except when they are really removed for despatch to the aforesaid port, according to the original declaration, within a period which shall not exceed three (10) months from the time of their being landed, and on condition that there shall have teen no change of property therein. Sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) as per draft treaty. (4) All goods and merchandise transhipped or landed for the repair of damage caused by stress of weather or other disaster at eea, provided that cargo so landed he ie?hipped and exported to a foreign port and taken away on board of the same vessel or on annther yessel^lrij Tf if la rlpmdpH that their efforts are in vain, or its voyage in any way wiwevtu, Article VI. goods remain in the custom house by way in the custom house by way of6 transhipment, or in other ways, and the owner thereof, or his deputy, has not arrived to take delivery of them, their permission to remain in the custom house shall be for a period of six months, if they are of the nature of grain and perishable goods ; and, if they are of the nature of metals or woven goods which will admit of delay their permission to remain in the Custom house shall be for the period &lt;jf one year. Then, if the owner thereof, or his deputy, comes to take delivery thereof, he shall pay the warehouse tax of the custom house for this period; and, if the owner, or his deputy, does not come within the expiry of this period, the disposal thereof shall be, if he pleases, at discretion and choice of th e Superintendent of Customs (12). Notes—(1) “ of whatever description ” requires to be inserted. Slip of the pen probab le. (2) would have to be altered ; “ except intox i cants and arms and ammunition of which c ase is dealt with in Articles of this treaty ” would seem preferable. (3) This foreshadows an or ground rent which is perhaps poorly translated by warehouse— tax. It will be necessary to specify the amount of of such tax, it' it should be serion^ly considered&gt; and it would be better that the matter should be dealt with m a separate Article, in which case this clause would perhaps best be amended as follows ; “and, on payment thereof, such goods shall there after be exempt, within the Sultan's domin ions, from all other duties or taxes levied b y, or on be- half of, the Government of Mis Highness t he Sultan, by whatever names these may be d esignat ed except such taxes as -are specifically desc ribed hereafter in the subsequent Articles of this Treaty (4) Note (4) to Article II. Another rendering of “ most favoured nation (5) Fide note (2) to Article IV. (6) His Highness has been so anxious to ex plain that goods for transhipment must pay “ ground rent ” or “ warehouse tax ' J , that he has l eft put the clause that governs this Article fro m this point to the end and so makes nonsense of sub-paragraphs (2), (3) and (4). This, I feel' sure, is only careless drafting. The intention is clpa r. The amendment in uote (3) above will remov e this difficulty. (7) Verbal discrepancies of no importance . (8) Clumsy drafting which I trust to be ab le to remove as unnecessary in course of discussion . (9) “Warehouse dues” or “ground r ent ” again, which might, if at all likely to be approved, go io separate Article. (10) I cannot understand the object of this alteration if “ ground rent ” is approved, presum ably it would pay Customs Department to keep them. This should offer no difficulty.7 fll) I do not understand why His Highness offers this indulgence. If he approves of it, there seems no reason why we should object to it. (12) This is merely an amplification of the rest of the Tr eaty and it would seem only fair and practically is alread y understood. The Customs cannot be expected to keep unclaimed goods for ever. It would read better if the final clause said “ shall be forfeit to the Muskat Government ” but we coul d not prevent His Highness making them a perquisite of the Customs Superiutendent i f he chose. It would be advisable to put in a clause th at “ One month before such goods are de clared forfeit to the State in the case of perish- able good s and three months in the case of ordinary goods, the Customs Superintendent must give notice in writing of his intention to declare such go ods forfeit to the State and to the British Consul, stating nature of goods, quantity, weight, nu mber, marks and all information likely to lead to ide ntification of owner, and this irrespective of whether h e has reason to believe that the goods unclaimed ar e the property of other than British subjects or not/* Article VII. No article whatever shall be prohibited from bein' imported into, or exported from, the terri- tories of His Highness the Sulta n except intoxi . cants (1). Then the Sultan may decide on the ~^ b!bitIon or license thereof (2). And further, when the Sultan may see fit to prohibit the import or export of certain goods to prevent injury feared by him, then he may prohibit (3) (4). N OTR g.—(1) short like this, the exception might stand I t hink, it would be advisable if “arms and am munition }&gt; wer^sdsc^ad^ej^^^Add^alscT^^ ^ith reg ard to which two classes of articles, tbe provisions ar e laid down in articles respectively/' (2) C ould not, I think, be admitted without considerable reserve. (3) Far too wide and better omitted altogether (4) It will be noted that the Article, as amended, is silent on Export duties. This will have to be reinserted 1 presume. Article VIII. Bead right down to “ Special Board ” in 6th line and after insert ' such as His Majesty (1) . The Sultan shall appoint ” (2) and thence to end of Article. (1 ) Notes. The use of the word hitherto reserved for His Majesty the Hiug seems objec- tionable. I would request early instructions on this point. (2) Otherwise the proviso seems a harmless con cession to His Highness’s “ amour propre. ” Such b bo ard seems highly improbable and the nominal approval of His Highness would, I presume, be considered essential.8 Article IX It shall be left to the choice of British subjects whether they shall pay the duties, according to the percentage laid down iu the Vlth Article, either in cash or in goods or produce, should it be possible to levy the tax i n this way tl). If the payment of the duties shall be in cash, (2) the value of the merchandise and goods on which taxes are levied shall be calculated according to the local cash prices ruling at the date of levy. In the matter of merchandise imported from foreign ports, the value shall be reckon ed according to the price ruling in the Maskat baz ar. And in the matter of the goods and natural products of the country thpjr value shall be calculated accor ding to the local cash prices ruling in the place wh ere the merchant may elect to pay the duty (3). Then, in the event of any dispute arising between a British subject and the Custom House authorit ies regarding the value of goods the matter shall be placed before ar bitrators appointea and the price shall be as finally fixed by them. But should these two p arties (arbitrators meant) not asree. then it shall be on the two parties that the y should choose an umpire and his decision shall be final (4)\ Notes (1). A poor rendering of the neat draft ing of our draft treaty, but the only essent ial alteration is a concession to the Britis h subjeot. (2 ) Verbal discrepancy of no importa nce. (3) Superfluous, but unobjectionable, nrobablr. however, introduced as leading up to the very objectionable alteration which follows immediately, (4&gt;) Open to grievous abuses. Merchant s are quite enough under the thumb of the Customs * 2 3 * * * 7 ^pgriutendeiUas it is and such a pr ovision as this would lead to endless bickering and dela ys. The provision in the draft treaty is ordinary and fair! Article X. Then His Higness the Sultan of Mashat, accord ing to this treaty, engages that he will make an arrangement according to his power and ability (1) so that the movement of goodsTin transit shall not be hindered or delayed by irksome and unneces sary vexations and restrictions, etc.; And likewise His Highness promises that there shall be afforded to goods facili ti es for transport as far as possible (1) and His Highness the Sultan sha ll have authority as to whom he shall appoi nt as landing contractor (2) (3) (•4.). Notes (I). These provisions point to confession of weakn s^ d forediadow^n attempt t o evado ti.e treaty. I think they should be o pposed! (2). The new p-ovision is probably a r eply to our many remonstrances as to tiie scand alous non' duct of the ptvsent nominee of His H ighness Abdul Kadir, who, besid es being a notnrimi^ drunkard, is at the head of an organised gang of robbers and pilferers of cargo, wbo call themseUe s tally clerks, boatmen and coolies. I th ink, how ever. the phrase might stand qualified as follows&lt;e but, at the same time His Highness, looking to the interests of trade and the importance of the protection of eroods fr om pilfering between ship and shore, hereby promises to attach the greatest weight to the recommendations and re- monstrances of His Majesty^ Consul, when based on the proceedings o f a committee of British traders residing in Maskat/ *' (3) It will be noticed that the phrase &lt;e and that standard scales reside ” has been omitted , probably through inadvertence. (4) While we a re dealing wit h this matter, it would seem advisable to include thi s proviso “ whereas the attention of His Highness the Sultan has been drawn to the many complaints, alleging that cargo, especially rice, destined for o ther ports, has, in course of trans it, been pilfered by Maskat coolies and others, working o n board British steamers, His Hig hness hereby engages that, on the requisition of a British merchant, supported by His Majesty's Consul, he will provide a suitable guard of his own sepoys, under the command of a comp etent official, in the appoint ment of whom and in regard to the num ber of sepoys despatched on this duty, His H ighness will g ive due weight to the represe ntations of the British merchant and Consul. ThTduties of this guard will be to arrest and make over to His Highness, for prompt and condign punishment, at the infliction ot which the British merchan t or a representative from His Britannic Majesty's Con sulate shall be given the opportunity to a ttend, all vagabonds and unauthorised persons , Maskat subjects, found loitering on board a British mer chant steamer and especially all person s caught on board m the act of pilfering cargo. It is, however, understood that, in such a case, no arrests will b e made except at the instance of the Captain of the vessel or the British merchant or their ag ents. Such sepoys will be paid direct by the Agent or Captain of the steamer concerned a daily w age of Its. per di^m and t he otiicer in chartre a daily wage of H,s. 5 per diem, to be borne by the meronant making the requisition, so long as the aforesaid guard is employed on this duty. Article XL British vessels entering a port in the dominions of His Highness the Sultan in distress shall receive from the local authorities all (1) aid in their power (2 ) to enable them to revictual and relit so as to proceed on their voyage. Should a British vessel be wrecked off the coast of His Highness’s dominions, the authorities of His Highness shall render all assistance in their power to the distressed vessel in order to save the xessel, her cargo, and those on board ; they shall also give aid (3) to save persons and shall assist them in reaching the nearest British Consulate; they shall further take every possible care that the goods so recovered are safely stored, and kept for the purpose of being handed over to the owner, captain, agent of the vessel or British Consul10 subject always to rights of salvage. And they shall not be exempt from duties if destined for a port in His Highness's dominions ( 4.). His Highness's authorities shall further see that, as far as lies in their power, (2) the British Con sulate is at ouce informed of such a disaster having occurred. Should a British vessel, wrecked on the coast of His Highness's dominions, be plundered, the authorities of His Highness shall as soon as they come to know thereof make all possible efforts (2) to render prompt assistance and take measures to pursue and punish the robbers and recover the stolen property to the utmost of their abilit y (2) and those things shall likewise be sub ject to rights of restoration . (5) Likewise, should a vessel of Bis Highness, or of one of his subjects* enter a British port in distress or be wrecked off the coast of His Majesty’s dominions, the like help and assistance shall be rendered by the British authorities. Note (1) “necessary” omitted; probably slip of the pen. (2) The cumulative effect of all these provisoes looks ominous and, as if His Highness’s officials intend to plead inability in most cases and so evade their responsibilities under this Arti cle. (3) perhaps a slip of the pen caused the omis sion of the words “ and prote ction. ” (4) seems unnecessary but harmless. (5) No great objection to this proviso, as it would probnbly stir local authorities to greater LL_!X2Hld be necessary to s pecify the amount levied, but it seems in general accord ance with the Gulf custom and would probably run to JO per cent of value of goods restored . Article XII. Should sailors or others, belonging to a British ship of war or merchant vessel, desert and take refuge on shore or on board of any of His High ness s ships the authorities of His Highness shall, upon request of a Consular official, or in his absence, of the captain of the ship (1) take the necessary steps in order to have them arrested and delivered over to the Consular official or to the captain. ^ claim for t he expiry of the term of his service or other comp laint, according to the rule s of justice (2) and the Consular officials and the Captain (I) shall render every assistance in the pursuance of this order. (3) Likewise, shou ld sailors or others desert from one of the ships of the Sultan of Maskat, or from one of the ships of H ni .Majesty s subjects, (4) the authorities ot His Majesty the King shall likewise act as aforesaid and the dictum of the master of the ship shall be accepted after enquiry into the terms of service of the deserter, although he may not have with himl paper as to the duration of the term of service. (5).Note (1). No difficulty anticipated in inserting the words “or his representative ” (2) thoroughly objectionable, would ooly be made applicable to genuine Maskat subjeets, who declared themselves to be such at the time of their engagement, and the enquiry in such a case would he by His Hritannic Majesty's Consular Court, as a British subject wonl be def endant. (3) ambiguous and unnecessary. (4) obiectionable, alludes to His Highness, vide Note (l)to Article VIII. (5) this is not understood and in any ease is badly drafted as it does not state clearly, though it may mean “ take refuge on board a British ship or in British territory.’ Verbal discussion with His Highness might make this clear, but, in any case, I doubt if a British Court, could accept the startling attempt of the last clause to do away with the effects of the carelessness of the Maskat captain in not drawing up a proper written engagement with his crew . Article. XIII. British subjects shall, as regards their person and property enjoy, within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, the rights of exterritoriality. And, as a result of that, the authorities of His Highness the Sultan shall have no right to interfere in disputes with British subjects amongst them selves, or between them and members of other Christian nations; such questions, whether of a civil or criminal nature, shall be decided by the authorities of the British (1) Consulate. Except should there arise among them sedi tion from which injur y may be feared for others and there shall not be near at h and a British authority, then the authorities of His Highness the Sultan shall interfere i n the pacifying of that sedition for the removal of that injury (2). And (3) the punishment of all offences and crimes of which British subjects may be accused within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, and also the hearing and settlement of all civil questions, claims or dispute s between British sub - jects defandents, (4) is a right reserved to tue Consular authorities and their Courts and remov ed from the jurisdiction of His Highness. The proceedings and final decision in such claims , should the plaintiff be one of the subjects of His Majesty the Sultan shall not be considered legal, esce pFthat they notify~~His M aje sty or his naib that they may be informed as to the case and the fixing of the order therein (5). Should disputes arise between subjects of His Highness or of any non-Christian Power not re presented by a Consul at Maskat, and a British subject in which the British subject is the plaintiff or complainant, the matter shall be brought before and decided by the highest authority of the Sultan or some person, specially delegated by him (6),12 The proceedings and final decision i: for the British Consul or his su at the hearing and final decision. — Notes. (1) an obvious blunder, but on ly re- guires to ^c ^pointed^out^to^be^cor rected. _J2) I am inc lined to think that this shoul d not be entered m the treaty. Such a case musTl^ extremely rare and action by the local authodS could only be called for in some grave emergenc y, when 1 have no doubt the local officials could trus^ ted to take im mediate steps. If thov roally nnnfinad the_action proposed to friendly intervention in quarrels for the best interests of all, when no British authority could intervene, they might be confident that the British Government or officials would not complain of their conduct, and it wmi Td do no harm that they sliould know that the ir con duct was likely to be subject to careful scrutiny! — (3) slip of the pen probably, but mu st be correc- ted. (4) bad Arabic drafting but meaning clear and in accordance with Treaty requirements. Easily corrected . (5) unnecessary ; such cases are never taken u p except at the instance ot His Highness, who'cou I3 keep himself well informed ot all tha t goes on in our Courts, where proceedings and final Tir'ders are public. Objectionable only m so far as it meapl an increase in office work, which could hardlyTe dealt with by present vernacular staff, consisting of one roan whose time is fully occupied. Interpolation must be due entirely to “ am our propre * and, if the concession were granted, it is extremely doubtful, if advantage would be ake n o f it. In Bahrain, where a similar privile ge of j oint se ssion and attendance is permitted, my ex perience led me to the conclusion that attendan ce was regarded as a wearisome corvee. Such officials as His Highness could produce would understand little of ourjprocedure and~know perfectly well tha t justice is impartial and that, in ninety-nine case s out of a hundred, there is nothing to complain ofT ( 6 ) The omission is important and must be opposed. I understand that Consul seld om objects but think he should have the power to do s o in the case of a notoriously corrupt or incompetent judge Subjects of His Highness the Sultan, or of any non-Christian Power, not represented by a Consul at Maskat, who are in the regular service of British subjects within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, shall enjoy the same privi leges as British subjects themselves. Should they be charged with having committed a crime or serious offence, i n which the lex talioois, according t o the traditions of of S hara ; law is necessary ( 1 )^ they shall, on sufficient evidence being shown to Article XIV.13 justify further proceedings, be handed over by their British employers, or by order of the British Consul for trial and punishment, a ccording to lex taiionis. And, likewise, British subjects, when they shall be in the true service of His Highness the Sultan, shall enjoy the same protection which the subjects of His Highness the Sultan enjoy {'£) . Notes .

(•2) Unless we want to have Maskat made an Alsatia for fugitives from_j3ritishjus^ an d the rather shady characters who already sni&gt; roun d the Sultan grow bold in wickedness, imagin ing that they are protected by the Sultan against the sanc tions of British criminal jurisdiction, we mo st oppose this provision. It is a matter of com- mon knowledge wh y it is necessary to protect Britis h domestic servants against the local authorities in O riental countries, but a similar reproach has neve r been laid to the charge of British officials . Article XV. Should a British subject, residing in the do minions of His Highness, be adjudicated bankrupt, the British Consul shall take possession of, recover, and realise all available property ^ and assets of such bankrupt to be dealt with and distri buted according to the provisions of the customary (1) Bankruptcy Laws. Note (1). A very poor substitute. I do not ima gine that any one knows what the customary B ankruptcy laws ^of^Maskat are ; it is, ho wever, notorious that Maskat bankrupt subjects are famous for their ingenious devices for successfully ^^mgThejusTcIai^^^j^reditois^^^^^^^^^, Article XVI. Should a subject of His Highness the Sultan resist or evade payment of the just and rio-htful claims of a British subject, the authorities of His Highness shall afford to the British creditor every aid and facility in recover ' ing the amount due to him. Except that, should it be verified that he is in indigent circumstances and unable to pay the dues, then he sh all, in that case, be decreed in indigent circumstances (1) and his r elatives shall not be respon sible for hnn (2). In like manner, the British Consul shall afford every aid and facility to subjects of His Highness, in recovering debts, justly due to them from a British subject. Notes ( 11 and (2). The invariable replies given alread y to the .just demands ot British subjects. The office files are full ot such lying pretensions a nd 1 have two cases pending now be lore me, in one of which a man, possessing a date-garden, pleads inability to pay a~tnfl in g ^ebt not on e^enth d; its value and is consistently supported by His14 Highness and his officials.

THE NEW TREATY. Article 1. The treaty concluded between Th e British Government (1) and Saiyid Faisal bin Turki bin Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Maskat and Oman. And this treaty, now concluded in the year 1839-H m Cancels all treaties that preceded it, (2) and at the time of exchange of ratifications, shall replace them. Note.—H is Highness has here confused pre amble and first articl e. 1 anticipa te no d ifficulty here in bringing him round to our point of view. As regards underlined portion (1) 1 pointed out to His Highness that the direct treaty with His Majesty was an honour that he should not lightly forego and he seeme d to ac cept my view. As regards underlined portion (2) I pointed out to His Highness that the wide terms ot this cancell ation rendered it impossible to accept, and he said that t he def ect would be remedied. Article 2. That, in virtue of this treaty, the subjects of the Indian Kings, (1) who have treaty relations with the British Government, shall be considered as subjects of the aforesaid Great Government also. And all subjects of the British Government shall be permitted to enjoy, throughout all the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, with reference to commerce and navigation and the exercise of trades and professions, as in every other respect, all the rights, immunities and protection of every nature which they possess, or enjoy, or which may be practised in future they shall enjoy them, (2) or which may be granted Her Majesty the Queen of the United King dom of Great Britain and Ireland, Empress of India, and His Highness the Seyyid Feysal-bin- Turki bin Saeed, Sultan of Muskat and Oman, being desirous to confirm and strengthen the friendly relations which now subsist between the two countries and to promote and extend their commercial relations, have named as their Pleni potentiaries to conclude a treaty for this purpose, that is to say :— Her Majesty the Queen of the United King dom of Great Britain and Ireland, Empress of India, Colonel Edward Charles Ross, Companion of the Star of India, Her Britannic Majesty’s Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; and His Highness the Sultan of Muskat in person; who had agreed upon and concluded the following Articles:— Article 1. The Treaty concluded between the British Gov ernment and Sultan Seyyid-bin-Sultan of Muskat and Oman on the 31st May, 1839 (17 Rabia 1st, 1255), is hereby cancelled and declared void, and the present Treaty, when ratified, shall be substi tuted for it. Article 2. Subjects of Her Britannic Majesty shall, for the purposes of this Treaty, include subjects of Native States in India in alliance with Her Majesty. Such subject shall enjoy, immediately and unconditionally, throughout the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muskat, with respect to commerce, shipping and the exercise of trade, as in every other respect, all the rights, privileges, immunities, advantages, and protection of whatsoever nature, which are or hereafter may be, enjoyed by, or accorded to, the subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation.in the future to the subjects of the great Govern ments and their subjects and, especially, there shall not be upon them duties, taxes, or conditions, or responsibilities of whatsoever nature more what may be upon others (3) or upon the objects of the great glorious Governments (4&lt;) and their people now or in the future. j^ 0TESi —(1) I think the use of the word “ King s J&gt; and the omission of the protection clause will be considered decidedly objectionable' Seditious Indian advisers seem to have been at work here and it is a piece of gratuitous imperti nence o n His .Highness's part to criticize our relatio ns with Native States in India which in no wa y concern him . (2 ) Arabic here obscure, and neither my Dra goman nor myself could follow it so as to make an exactly logical English translation. It sho uld, however, present no difficulty in alteration an d correction. It is probably careless drafting and nothing else. (3) Rather vague. I do not yet know what His Highness's views may be on the interpolation “the s ubjects or citizens of Maskat or Oman.” IT seem s to me to have its inconveniences in coniunction with the wide wording from “ as, in -T every etc., whatsoever nature , and I should be glad to know if its retention is considered of serious importance. (4) His Highness's emendation of “ most favoured nationof which value is doubtful. I should propose to tell him that “ most favoured natiou ', and its translation, , are well known diplomatic phrases of which every diplomat thoroughly unaerstands the signification, and that i t would be dangerous to alter them. » His Hi ghness asked me the meaning thereof and seemed suspicious about it, thinking that it referred to Christian Governments and was a slur o n non-Christian (iovernments. I explained to him that this was not the case and think there wil l be no difficulty here. Article III. Each of the two High Contracting Parties acknowledges (1) the right of the other to appoint Consuls in its territories, after permission and publication from either side to the other, (2) wher ever the interests of commerce may require the presence of such officers, and the aforesaid Consuls shall be considered, in the country in which they reside, on the footing of the Consuls of all the glorious Governments (3) in their rank. Each of the High Contracting Parties further agree to permit his own subjects to be appointed to Consular offices by the other Contracting Party: provided always that the persons so appointed shall not begin to act without the previous approbation of the Sovereign whose subjects they may be. The public functionaries of either Government residing in the dominions of the other shall enjoy the same privileges, immunities, and exemptions They shall more especially not be liable to other or more onerous duties, imposts, restrictions, or obligation of whatever decription, than those to which subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation now are, or hereafter may be, subjected. Article 3. The two High Contracting Parties acknowledge reciprocally to each other the right of appointing Consuls to reside in each others dominions wherever the interests of commerce may require the presence of such officers; and such Consuls shall at all times be placed, in the country in which they reside, on the footing of the Consuls of the most favoured nations. Each of the High Contracting Parties further agrees to permit his own subjects to be appointed to Consular Offices by the other Contracting Party, provided always that the person so appointed shall not begin to act without the previous approbation of the Sovereign whose subjects they may be. The public functionaries of either Government residing in the dominions of the other, shall enjoy the same privileges, immunities, and expmptions which are enjoyed within the same dominions by similar public functionaries of other countries.which are enjoyed within the same dominions by similar public functionaries of other countries (4) N ote (1) ^ reciprocally ” omitted, but practically all owed for, in the way Article is worded in the Arabic. I could probably arrange for a closer adap tation to the English. (2) Most objeotionable interpolation.

There shall be perfect freedom of commerce and navigation between the two High Contracting Parties ; and each shall allow the subjects of the other to enter all ports, creeks, and rivers belong ing to the two Governments, with their vessels and cargoes except places in a s tate of war or in which there is danger to life or p roperty on a ccoun t of w T ant of secur ity in those parts. Then the entry to those parts shall be after perm ission. (1) And to the subjects of both parties there shall be license to travel, and pursue commerce and trade, whether wholesale or retail, in each others' dominions, and therein to hire, purchase or possess houses, warehouses, and shops, and stores, and lands. (2) And also it shall be lawful for the subjects of the two High Parties (3) everywhere, that they shall buy, barter, sell—and that direct, or by means of agents—all kinds of merchandise, articles of import, or native production, for sale in their respective countries (3) or for transport to foreign countries, except intoxicants an d warlike material. Then it is for the Sultan of Maskat or for his naib the license or prohibition of their import or of their sale throughout his domini ons. (4) And it is lawful to them also that they should consult on the fixing of the price of all such goods and produce with their owner or his agent without the smallest interference on the part of the officials of the Highness of both Parties (5) and to His Highness the Sultan is reserved the privilege and monopoly in all that pertains to commerce and Profits '~ Native produce throughout his dominions. (6) taxes — Note (1 ), This gives a handle for constant interfere nce and Hiough^a^na tural enough pro vision, if we were sure that it would be reasonably used, might be most embarrassing in practise. It would, if it was to be seriously considered, have to be coupled with a reservation makingjmjexcep- tion in favour of British subjects domiciled in the place in a state of war or insecurity. Otherwise, at^every Bedouin squabble—and it is believed t hat half Om an is in a permanent state of insecurity Article 4. There shall be perfect freedom of commerce and navigation between the High Contracting Parties; each shall allow the subjects of the other to enter all ports, creeks, and rivers with their vessels and cargoes, also to travel, reside, pursue commerce and trade, whether wholesale or retail, in each other’s dominions, and therein to hire, purchase, and possess houses, warehouses, shops, stores, and lands. British subjects shall everywhere be freely permitted, whether personally or by agent, to bargain for, buy, barter, and sell all kinds of goods, articles of import, or native production, whether intended fur sale within the dominions of His Highness or for export, and to arrange with the owner or his agent regarding the price of all such goods and produce without interference of any sort on the part of the authority of His Highness. His Highness the Sultan of Muskat binds himself not to allow or recognise the establish ment of any kind of monopoly or exclusive privi lege of trade within his dominions to any Govern ment, Association, or individual.4 a t lea st, if not of war, British subjects might be prevented from going 1 to look after tbeir families and property when these were in the greatest danger . INo doubt the real ohject of the excep tio n is to give His Highness a pretext to oppose all travelling b y European travellers, and esp ecially Go vernment agents, which he regards with the greatest fear and sus picion. (2) The new a ddittorfig nat urally left out, as Hi~PTig hness did not know of it, when this draft treaty was prepared. I have so far had no oppor* tnnity of learning His Highness's views on this new proviso. 1 do not anticipate any great diffi culty. /.e. ^ A tUjU, fj-Cx fu/u^ '■ ^ /(joC ' (3) The alteration here appears to be due to offended “ amour propre ” and I see no great objection to it. (4) This is a move in the right direction, but the exception should not be pitchforked into the middle of Article IV, where it disturbs the sense of what follows. It should come in a separate article, and it would be better perhaps if one article were devoted to intoxicants and the maximum duty named. I would suggest that it might then be provided a special board of the kind contem plated in Articles VIII and XIX would be the best arrangement, to deal with the situation. The difficulties would be great, but not insuperable. The question of warlike material would require to be dealt with similarly. It seems to me that it would be advantageous to have an article denouncing the arms trade and expressing a ho pe that a board might be created to deal with tins difficult situation. The objects to be pursued being a high increase of the duty and strict control of both sale and export. (5) The paragraph re coastin g trade is omitted. Remarks in note (2) to this article apply. (6) His Highness probably does not understand the full significance of his alteration, and it may be difficult to get him to do so. He probably misunderstood the paragraph in the old treaty of 1891 and thought it an encroachment on his sovereign rig hts. I presume that a clause so destructive of the entire treaty must he absolutely vetoed. it. ^ t UmA ' 6n t*rr~\/ Article Y. Article 5. British subjects shall be permitted, throughout the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, to acquire land, houses and property of every descrip tion, whether moveable or immoveable, and that by way of gift, purchase, or intestate succession, or by will, or in other legal manner, but all that after information to His Highness the Sultan, or his Naib, and license from them both, (1) that they may enjoy it freely and at their own choice by way of sale, barter, gift or otherwise according to their desire and, when they desire, in laying a foundation, th at is, in buildin g on the roads an3 highways, except it may be an iunovation or new. Sobjects of Her Britannic Majesty shall be permitted, throughout the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, to acquire by Gift, purchase, intestate succession, or under will, or any other legal manner, land, houses, and property of every description, whether moveable or immoveable, to possess the same; and freely to dispose thereof by sale, barter, donation, or otherwise.In that case, before laying out a foundation , it is necessary for them to give news to the Govern- ^ ment of the 6ultan for the sake of looking 1 in to the matter and fixing the limits (2). (1) As worded seems impossible. Information would be the limit. At present, British subiects are required to register all new acquisitions ana transfers of landed property ot which the mtorm~- ation is probably what is required by the Sultan’s officials The utmost that would be expected would be that British subjects should pay the copying fees for a copy of each such registration, which His Britannic Majesty's Consul would then furnish to His Highness. (2) This would be reasonable enough, if one could be sure of being guarded against frivolous ob jections and delays. The danger presumably is British subjects encroaching on public lands and it is likely enough that they dp. The concession might be made provided that a time limit, say 21 days, were fixed after notice given for the s ettlement of the case by His Highness's court, at hearing and decision of which Consul or his representative should attend. Article VI. His Hignness the Sultan shall be permitted to levy a duty of entry, not exceeding 5 per cent on the value of all goods and merchandise (1), imported by sea from foreign countries into His Highness's dominions, except intoxicants in which he shall have liberty to take more than the tax aforesaid and to prohibit the sale thereof and to grant licenses. (2) This duty shall be paid at that port in His Highness's dominions where the goods are first landed ; and, on payment thereof, such goods shall be exempt in the matter of this tax, but should such goods be transferred throug h out all t he markets and towns, then they shall not he exempt from the warehouse taxes of those markets and towns. (3) And there shall not be demanded from British subjects any import tax exceeding the tax that is levied on the subjects and citizens of the greatest nations' countries (4). (5) and (6). As for the merchandise and goods, of whic h the destination is a foreign port, (7) and which are transhipped from one vesssl to another in any of the ports of His Highness the Sultan, or which have been for this purpose provisionally landed and deposited temporarily (7) in one of the Sultan's custom houses to await the arrival of a vessel for reshipment to a foreign port ; then, when the merchandise h ad been so land ed they shall not be exempt from duty, except when the consignee or his agent shall nave, on the arrival, of tbe vessel so stated and deposited those goods aforesaid for safe enstody m the custom house and has given intimation that they are landed for transhipment to another ship, and of the name of the port to which th e merchandise is to be exporte d then they shall be exempt from the special tax, but not from the warehouse du es (9)* And like wise, those goods shall not be exempt, except when Article 6 His Highness the Sultan shall be permitted to levy a duty of entry not exceeding 5 per cent on the value of all goods and merchandise, of what ever description, imported by sea from foreign countries into His Highness's dominions. This duty shall be paid at that port in His Highness’s dominions where the goods are first landed, and, on payment thereof, such goods shall thereafter be exempt, within the Sultan's dominions, from all other custom duties or taxes, levied by, or on behalf of, the Government of His Highness the Sultan, by whatever names these may be desig nated, and no higher import duty shall be claimed from British subjects than that which is paid subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation. This duty, once paid, shall cover, from all other charges on the part of His Highness the Sultan, goods of whatever description coming from Foreign countries by sea, whether these are intend ed for local consumption or for transmission else where in bulk or otherwise, and whether they remain in the state in which they are imported or have been manufactured. There shall, however, be exempted from pay ment of all duty the following, namely (1) All goods and merchandise which, being destined for a foreign port, are tran shipped from one vessel to another in any of the ports of His Highness the Sultan of Muskat, or which have been for this purpose provisionally landed and deposited in any of the Sultan's Custom houses to await the arrival of a vessel in which to be re-shipped abroad. But goods and merchandise so landed shall be exempted only, provided that the consignee or his Agent shall have, on the arrival of the ship, handed overthey are really removed for despatch to the aforesaid port, according to the original declaration, within a period which shall not exceed three (10) months ^irom the time of their being landed, and on condition that there shall have teen no change of property therein. Sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) as per draft treaty. (4) All goods and merchandise transhipped or landed for the repair of damage caused by stress of weather or other disaster at sea, provided that cargo so landed be reshipped and exported to a foreign port and taken away on board of the same vessel or on another vessel (11). If it is decided that their efforts are m vain, or the loading of the merchandise is delayed from its voyage in any way whatever, then, if the goods remain in the custom house by way of transhipment, or in other ways, and the owner thereof, or his deputy, has not arrived to take deliv ery of them, their permission to remain in the custom house shall be for a period of six mon ths, if they are of the nature of grain and perishable goods ; and, if they are of the nature of metals or woven goods which will admit of delay the ir permission to remain in the Custom house shall be for the period of one year. Then, if the owner thereof, or his deputy, comes to take deliver y thereof, he shall pay the warehouse tax of the custom house for this period ; and, if the own er, or his deputy, does not come within the expiry of this period, the disposal thereof shall be, if be ple ases, at discretion and choice of the Superintendent of Customs (12). Notes (1) ^ of whatever description *' requires to be inserted. Slip of the pen probable . (2) would have to be altered ; “ except intoxi cants and arms and ammunition of which easels dealt with in Articles of this treaty* 77 would seem preferable. (3) This foreshadows an or ground rent which is perhaps poorly translated by warehouse- tax. It will be necessary to specify the amount of of such tax, if it should be seriously considered and it would be better that the matter should be dealt with in a separate Article, in which case this clause would perhaps best be amended as follows: “ and, on payment thereof, such goods shall there- after be exempt, within the Sultan's dominions, from all other duties or taxes levied by, or on be half of, tke Government of His Highness the Sultan, by whatever names these may be designat ed exce pt such taxes as are specifically describ ed hereafter in the subsequent Articles of this Treaty (4) Note (4) to Article II. Another rendering of 0 most favoured nation ( 5) Vide note (2) to Artble IV. (6) His Highness has been so anxious to ex plain that goods for transhipment must pay “ ground rent ” or “ warehouse tax ', that he has left put the cla use that governs this Article from this point to the end and so makes nonsense of sub-paragraphs (2), (3) and (4). This, I feel sure, the said goods to be kept under Customs seal, and declared them as landed for transhipment, designating at the same time the foreign port of destination, and also provided that the said goods are actually shipped for the said foreign port as originally declared, within a period not exceeding six months after their first landing, and without having, in the interval, changed owners. (2) All goods and merchandise which, not being consigned to a port within the dominions of the Sultan, have been in* advertently landed, provided that such goods are re-shipped within a month of being so landed and transported abroad. Should, however, such goods or mer chandise, here spoken of, be opened or removed from the custody of the Customs authorities, the full duty shall then be payable on the same. (3) Coals, naval provisions, stores, and fittings, the property of Her Majesty’s Gov ernment, landed in the dominions of His Highness for the use of the ships of Her Majesty's Navy. (4) All goods and merchandise transhipped or landed for the repair of damage caused b 7 stress of weather or orther disasters at sea, provided the cargo so discharged shall be re-shipped and taken away on board of the same vessel, or if the latter shall have been condemned, or her departure delayed, in any other manner.7 {LSo on ly careless drafting. The intention ia clpar. The am endment m note (3) above will remove this difficulty. (7) V erbal discrepancies of no importance. (8) Cl umsy drafting which I trust to be able to re move as unnecessary in course of discussion. (9) “Warehouse dues” or “ground rent” a gain, which might, if at all likely to be approved, go i n separate Article. (10 ) I cannot understand the object of this alter ation if “ ground rent ” ia approved, presum ably *t would pay Customs Department to keep them. This should offer no difficulty. (11) I do not understand why His Highness offers this indulgence. If he approves of it, there sepms no reason why we should object t o it. (12) This is merely an amplification of the rest of the Treaty and it would s eem only fair and practically is alread y un derstood. The~Customs cannot be expected to keep unclaimed g oods^for ever. It would read better if the final clau se said “shall !&gt;e forfeit to the Maskat Governm ent^ but we could not prevent His Highness m aking them a perquisite of the Cust oms Superintendent if he chose. It would be advisable to put in''a clause that “ One month before such goods are declared forfeit to the State i n the case of perish! aid e goods and three months in th e case of ordinary goods, the Customs Superintendent mu st give notice in writing of his intention to declar e such goods forfeit to the State and to the B ritish Consul, stating nature of goods, quantit y, Weight, number, marks and all information likely to lead to identification of own er, and this irrespective of whether he has reason to believe th~t~the~g oods unclaimed are the property of other than British subjects or not.” Article VII, No article whatever shall be prohibited from being imported^ into, or exported from, the terri tories of His Highness the Sulta n except intoxi cants (1). Then the Sultan may decide on the prohibition or license thereof (2). And further, when the Sultan may see fit to prohibit the impo rt or export, of certain goods to prevent injury feare d b y him, then he ma y prohibit (3) (4). _ Notes. (1) short like this, the exception might stand I think, it would be advisable if “ar ms and ammunition were also added. Add also “with regard to which two classes of ai tides, the provisions are laid down in Articles respect ively. (2) C ould not, I think^ Jbo admitted without considerable re serve. _ (3) Far too wide and better omitted altogether. ^^O^j^^bl^J ^djuteffithaVtlmArticle, as amended, is silent on Export duties. This will have to~be &lt; £gffiserted 1 presume. Article 7. No article whatever shall be prohibited from being imported into or exported from the terri tories of His Highness the Sultan of Muskat, and no export duties are to be levied on goods exported from those territories except with the consent of the Government of Her Britannic Majesty, such consent being subject to the conditions that may be laid down in the notifications intimating the same.Article VIII. Read right down to « Special Board ^ m 6th line and after insert “ jsuch as His Majesty (1) . /' be Sultan shall appoint ” (2) and thence to end of Article. Ti l Notes. The use of the word hitherto rpcp rved for His Ma,-|esty the JLiog seems ob]ec^ tin nahle. I would request early instructions on this point._ ( 2 ) Otherwise the proviso seems a harmless con- to His Highnoss's (&lt; amour propre. ” 8ueh a board seems highly improbable and rlie nominal approval of His Highness would, I presume, be considered essential. Article IX. I t shall he left to the choice of British subjects whether they shall pay the duties, according to the percentage l aid down in the V 1th Article, either u&gt; cash or in goods or produce, should it be possible to levy the tax in this way, yl) If the payment of the duties shall he in cash, (2) the value of the merchandise and goods on which taxes are levied shall be calculated according to the local cash prices ruling at the date of levy. In the mat ter of merchandise imported from foreign ports, the value shall be reckoned according to the price ruling in the M askat bazar. And in the matter of the goods and natural products of the co untry th^ir value shall_he^calculate^^ iCcording^to the local cash prices ruling m the place where the merchant may elect to pay the duty j3). Then, in the event of any dispute arising between a British subject and the Custom House authorit* ies regarding the value of goods the matter shall be placed before arbitrators appointeu and the price shall be as finally fixed by them. But should these two parties (arbitrators meant) not agree, then it shall be on the two parties that t hey should choose an umpire and his decision sha'd he final (4Q. Notes (l)^^Apoorr«nderipgof^the^iieat^draft- ing of pur draft _treaty 2 ^but^ the^onl 2 ^e 8 sential alteration is a concession to the British subject. (2 ) Verbal discrepancy of no importance. (3) Superfluous hut unobjectionable, probably, however, introduced as lead ing up to th e very objectionable alteration which follows immediately. (4) Open to grievous abuses. Merchants are quite enough under the thumb of the Customs* Superintendent as it is and such a provision as this would lead to endless bickering and delays. Th7 provision in the draft treaty is ordinary and fair. Article X. Then His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, accord ing to this treaty, engages that he will make an arrangement according to his power and abilit y (1) so that the movement of goods in transit shall not be hindered or delayed by irksome and unneces sary vexations and restrictions, etc.; And likewise Article 8. It is agreed and understood by the High Con tracting Parties that, in the event of an arrange ment being entered into hereafter between His Highness and the powers having Treaty relations with Muskat, and to which Great Britain shall be a consenting party, whereby vessels entering the port of Muskat shall be charged with shipping, tonnage, or harbour dues, such dues to be admi nistered under the control of a special Board for the improvement of the harbour and construction and maintenance of lighthouses, &amp;c.; nothing in the aforementioned provisions shall he con strued so as to exempt British vessels from payment of such shipping, harbour, or tonnage dues as may hereafter be agreed upon. Article 9. It shall be at the option of the British subject in each case to pay the percentage duties stipulated in Article 6, either in cash, or, if the nature of the goods allows of it, in kind, by giving up an equivalent amount of the goods or produce. In the event of payment being made in cash, the value of the merchandise, goods, or produce on which duty is to be levied, shall be fixed according to the ready money market price ruling at the time when the duty is levied. In the case of foreign imports, the value shall be fixed according to the market price at Muskat, and in that of native goods and produce by the market price at the place where the merchant shall choose to pay the duty. In the event of any dispute arising between a British subject and the Custom-house authorities regarding the value of such goods, this shall be determined by reference to two experts, each party nominating one, and the value so ascer tained shall be decisive. Should, however, these experts not be able to agree, they shall choose an umpire, whose decision is to be considered final. Article 10. His Highness the Sultan of Muskat engages by the present Treaty to provide and give orders to His officials that the movement of goods in transit shall not be obstructed or delayed in a vexatious manner by unnecessary Customs forma lities and Regulations, and that every facility will be given for their transport.His Highness promises that there shall be afforded to good s faciliti es for transport as far as possible (1) and His Highness the Sultan shall have authority as to whom he shall appoint aa ^anding contractor (2) (3) (4»). Notes (1) These provisions point to confessio n of weakness and foreshadow an attempt to e vade the treaty. I think they should be op posed. (2) The new provision is probably a reply to our many remonstrances as to the scandalous c on duct of the present nominee of His Highness, Abdul Ka dir, who, besides being a notoriou s drunkard, is at the head of an organised gang of robbers and pilferers of cargo, who call thems elves tally clerks, boatmen and coolies. I think, how ever, the phrase might stand qualified as follows “ but, at the same time His Highness, looking to the interests of trade and the importan ce of t he proteotion of goods from pilfering bet ween ship and shore, hereby promises to attach th e greatest weight to the recommendations an d re- monstrances of His Majesty’s Consul, when b asecl on the proceedings of a committee of British traders residing in Maskat.' ,, (3) It will be noticed that the phrase “ and that standard scales reside ” has been om itted probably through inadvertence. (4) While we a re dealing wit h this matter, it would seem advisable to include th is proviso whereas the attention of His Highness t he Sultan has been drawn to the many complaints, alleging that cargo, especially rice, destined for other ports, has, in course of transit, b een pilfered by Maskat coolies and others, working on b oard British steamers, His Highness hereby e ngages that, on the requisition of a British merchant, supported by His Majesty's Consul, he will p rovide a suitable guard of his own sepoys, under t he command of a competent official, in the app oint ment of whom and in regard to the numbe r of sepoys despatched on this duty, His Highn ess will give due w eight to the representations of the British merchant and Consul. The duties of this guard will be to arrest an d make over to His Highness, for prompt and condign punishment, at the infliction of which the British merc hant or a representative from His Britannic Majesty's Con sulate shall be given the opportunity to a t tend* all vagabonds and unauthorised persons, Ma skat subjects, found loitering on board a British m er chant steamer and especially all persons cau ght on board in the act of pilf ering cargo. It is, however, understood that, in such a case, no arrests wi ll be made except at the instance of the Captain of the vessel or the British merchant or t heir agents. Such sepoys will be paid direct by the Agent o r Captain of the steamer concerned a daily wag e of Bs. 2^ per diem and t he othcer in charge a daily wage of Rg. 5 per diem, to be borne by the merctiant making the r equisition, so long as the aforesaid guard is employed on this duty.Article XL British vessels entering a port in the dominions of His Highness the Sultan in distress shall receive from the local authorities all (1) aid their power (2) to enable them to re-victual and ictit so as to proceed on their voyage. Should a British vessel be wrecked off the coast of His Highness’s dominions, the authorities of His Highness shall render all assistance in their power to the distressed vessel in order to save the vessel, her cargo, and those on board ; they shall also give aid (3) to save persons and shall assist them in reaching the nearest British Consulate; they shall further take every possible care that the goods so recovered are safely stored, and kept for the purpose of being handed over to the owner, Captain, agent of the vessel or British Consul subject always to rights of salvage. And they shall not be exempt from duties if destined for a port in His Highness's dominions (4) . His Hisrhness’s authorities shall further see that, as far as lies in their power, (2) the British Con sulate is at ouce informed of such a disaster having occurred. Should a British vessel, wrecked on the coast of His Highness's dominions, be plundered, the authorities of His Highness shall as soon as they come to know thereof make all possible efforts (2) to render prompt assistance and take measures to pursue and punish the robbers and recover the stolen property to the utmost of their abilit y (2) and those things shall likew ise be subject to rights of restoration . (5) Likewise, should a vessel cf His Highness, or of one of his subjects* enter a British port in distress or be wrecked off the coast of His Majesty’s dominions, the like help and assistance shall be rendered by the British authorities. Note (1) “necessary” omitted; probably slip of the pen. (2) The cumulative effect of all these provisoes jooks^ominous and, as if His Highness’s officials intend to plead inability in most cases and so evade their responsibilities under this Article. ( , ‘ )&gt; ) perhaps a slip of the pen caused the omis sion of the words u and protection . ' w seems unnecessary but harmless. __(5) No great objection to this proviso, as it would probably stir local authorities to greater eflorts. It would be necessary to specify the amount levied, but it, seems in general accordance 2 )j^ _tb£_Gj£lf_custom and would probably run to jjl_per cent of value of goods restored. Article XII. Should sailors or others, belonging to a British ship of war or merchant vessel, desert, and take reiuge on shore or on board of any of His Hio-h- ness's ships the authorities of His Highness shall, upon request of a Consular official, or in his absence, of the Captain of the ship (1) take the necessary steps in order to have them arrested and delivered over to the Consular official or to the Captain. Article 11. British vessels entering a port in the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muskat, in distress, shall receive from the local authorities all necessary aid to enable them to re-victual and refit so as to proceed on their voyage. Should a British vessel be wrecked off the coast of His Highness’s dominions, the authorities of His Highness shall render all assistance in their power to the distressed vessel in cfrder to save the ship, her cargo and those on board; they shall also give aid and protection to persons saved, and shall assist them in reaching the nearest British Consulate ; they shall further take every possible care that the goods so recovered are safely stored, and kept for the purpose of being handed over to the owner, Captain, Agent of the ship, or British Consul, subject always to rights of salvage. His Highness’s authorities shall further see that the British Consulate is at once informed of such disaster having occurred. Should a British vessel, wrecked on the coast of His Highness’s dominion, be plundered, the authorities of His Highness shall, as soon as they come to know thereof, render prompt assistance and take measures to pursue and punish the robbers, and recover the stolen property. Like wise, should a vessel of His Highness the Sultan of Muskat, or of one of his subjects, enter a British port in distress, or be wrecked off the coast of Her Majesty’s dominions, the like help and assistance shall be rendered by the British authorities. Article 12. Should sailors or others belonging to a British ship of war, or merchant vessel, desert, and take refuge on shore or on board of any of His High ness’s ships, the authorities of His Highness the Sultan of Muskat shall, upon request of a Consular official, or, in his absence, of the Captain of the ship, take the necessary steps in order to have them arrested and delivered over to the Consular official or to the Captain.11 But, should the deserter have a claim for the expiry ot the term of his service or other complaint, t hen the claim shall be heard according to the rules of justice (2) and the Consular officials and the ^ Captain (1) shall render every assistance in the pursuance of this order, (3) Likewise, should Bailors or others desert from one of the ships of the Sultan of Maskat, or from one of the ships of His Majesty's subjects, (4) the authoritips of His Majesty the King shall likewise act as aforesaid a nd the dictum of the master of the ship shall be accepted after enquiry into the terms of service of t he deserter, although he may not have with him a paper as to the duration of the term of service (5 ). Note (1) No difficulty anticipated in inserting the words “or his represe ntative/' (2) thoroughly objectionable, would only be made ap plicable to g enuine Maskat subjects, who declared themselves to be such at~hTTiroe~of Their engagement, and the enquiry in such a case would be by His Britannic Majesty's Consular Court, as a British subject woul be defendan t. (3) ambiguous and unneces sary. (4) objectionable , alludes to His Highness, vide Note (1) to Article VIIL (5) this is not understood and in any c ase is badly drafted as it does not state cle arly, though it may mean u take refuge on board a British ship or in British territory.*' Verbal discussion with His Highness might make this clear, but, in any case, I doubt if a British Court could accept the startling attempt of the last clause to do away with the effects of t he carelessness of the Maskat Cap tain in not drawing up a proper written engagement with his crew . Aeticle. XIII. British subjects shall, as regards their person and property enjoy, within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, the rights of ex-territoriality. And, as a result of that, the authorities of His Highness the Sultan shall have no right to interfere in disputes with British subjects amongst them selves, or between them and members of other Christian nations; such questions, whether of a civil or criminal nature, shall be decided by the authorities of the British (1) Consulate. Except should there arise among them sedition from which i njury may be feared for others and tlmre shall not be near at hand a British authority, then th e authorities of His Highness the Sultan shall interfere in the pacifying of that sedition for th e removal of that injury (2). And (3) the punishment of all offences and crimes of which British subjects may be accused, within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, and also the hearing and settlement of all civil questions, claims or disputes between British sub- jects defendant s, (4) is a rignt reserved to tne Consular authorities and their Courts and removed from the jurisdiction of His Highness. In this, however, the Consular officer and Captain shall render every assistance. Article 13. Subjects of Her Britannic Majesty shall, as regards their person and property, enjoy within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muskat the rights of ex-territoriality. The authorities of His Highness the Sultan have no right to interfere in disputes with subjects of Her Britannic Majesty amongst themselves, or between them and members of other Christian nations; such questions, whether of a civil or criminal nature shall be decided by the competent Consular authorities. The trial and also the punishment of all offences and crimes of which British subjects may be accused within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, also the hearing and settlement of all civil questions, claims, or disputes in which they are the defen dants, is expressly reserved to the British Consular authorities and Courts, and removed from the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan. Should disputes arise between subjects of His Highness the Sultan or other non-Christian Power, not represented by Consuls at Muskat, and a subject of Her Britannic Majesty, in which the British subject is the plaintiff or complainant, the12 The proceedings and final decision in such claims should the plaintiff be one of the subjects of His Maj esty the Sultan shall not be considered legal, except ttiat they notify His Majesty or his naib ^at they may be informed as to the case and the fixin g of the order therein (5). Should disputes arise between subjects of His Highness or of any non*Christian Power not re presented by a Consul at Maskat, and a British subject in which the British subject is the plaintiff or complainant, the matter shall be brought before and decided by the highest authority of the Sultan or some person, specially delegated by him/(6). The proceedings and final decision in such a case shall not, however, be considered legal, unless notice has been given and an opportunity afforded for the British Consul or his substitute to attend at the hearing and final decision. Notes. (1) an o bviou s blunder , but only re quires to be pointed out to be corrected. (2) I am inclined to think that this should not be entered in the treaty. Such a case mu st be extremely rare and action by the local authorities could only be called for in some grave emergency, when i have no doubt the local officials could be trusted to take immediate steps. If they really con fined the action proposed to friendly intervention in quarrels for the best interests of all, when no British authority could intervene, they might be confident tbat the British Government or officials would not complain of their conduct, and it would do no harm that they should know that their con duct was likely to be subject to careful scrutiny. (3) slip of the pen probably, but must be correc ted. (4) bad Arabic drafting but meaning clear and in accordance with Treaty requirements. Easily corrected. (5) unnecessary ; such cases are never taken up exce pt at the instance ot His Highness, who could kee p himself well informed of all that goes on in our Courts, where proceedings and final order ar e public. Objectionable only in so far as it means an increase in office work, which could hardly be dealt with b y present vernacular staff, consisting of one man whose time is fully occupied. Interpolation must be due entirely to “ amour propre ” and, if the concession were granted, it is extremely doubtful, if advantage would be taken o f it. In Bahrain, where a similar privile ge of joint sess io n and attendance is permitted, my ex perience led me to the conclusion tbat attendance was regarded as a wearisome corvee. Such official s as His Hig hness could produce would understand l ittle of ou r procedure and know perfectly well that justice is impartial and that, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, there is nothing to complain of. (6) The omission is important and must be op posed. I understand that Consul seldom ob jects but think he should have the power to do so in the case of a notoriously corrupt or incompetent judge. matter shall be brought before and decided by the highest authority of the Sultan, or some person specially delegated by him for this purpose. The proceedings and final decision in such a case shall not, however, be considered legel unless notice has been given and an opportunity afforded for the British Consul or his substitute to attend at the hearing and final decision. l.C.Article XIY. Subjects of His Highness the Sultan, or of any non-Christian Power, not represented by a Consul at Maskat, who are in the regular service of British subjects within the dominions of His ^Highness the Sultan, shall enjoy the same privi leges as British subjects themselves. Should they be charged with having committed a crime or serious offence, in which the le x talionis, according t o the traditions of Shara’ law is necessary (1) , they shall, on sufficient evidence being shown to justify further proceedings, be handed over by their British employers, or by order of the British Consul for trial and punishment, a ccording to lex talio nis. And, likewise, British subjects, when they shall be in the true service of His Highness the Sultan, shall enjoy the same protection which the subjects of His Highness the Sultan enjoy (2) . Notes. (1) The alteration is a poor one for the si mple and salutary proviso of the draft Treaty . The use of the Arabic word , instead of the more usual and milder words for punishment looks to me ominous and we might find a useful British s ervant, caught in a petty theft, having his hand cut off, or mutilated, or subjected to some other barbarous form of tortur e. ('1) Unless we want to have Maskat made an Al satia for fugitives from British justice in India, and the rather shady characters who already snr - round the Sultan grow bold in wickedness, ima gin ing that they are protected by the Sultan against the sanctions of British criminal jurisdicti on, we most oppose this provision. It is a matter of oom- mon knowledge why it is necessary to protect British domestic servants against the local authorities in Oriental countries, but a similar rep roach has never been laid to the charge of British officials . Article XV. Should a British subject, residing in the do minions of His Highness, be adjudicated bankrupt, the British Consul shall take possession of, recover, and realise all available property and assets of such bankrupt, to be dealt with and distri buted according to the provisions of the customary (1) Bankruptcy Laws. Note (1). A very poor substitute. I do not imagine that any one knows what the customary Bankruptcy laws of Maskat are; it is, however, notorious that Maskat bankrupt subjects are famous for their ingenious devices for successfully evading the just claims of creditors. Article XVI. Should a subject of His Highness the Sultan resist or evade payment of the just and rightful claims of a British subject, the authorities of His Highness shall afford to the British creditor every aid and facility in recover ing the amount due to him. Except that, should ^ be verified that be is in indigent circumstances and unable to pay the dues, then he shall, in that case, be decreed in indigent circumstances (1) and his relatives shall not be responsible for him (2). Article 14 Subjects of His Highness the Sultan, or any non-Christian nation, not represented by Consuls at Muskat, who are in the regular service of British subjects within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muskat, shall enjoy the same protection as British subjects themselves. Should they be charged with having committed a crime or serious offence punishable by law, they shall, on sufficient evidence being shown to justify further proceedings, be handed over by British employers, or by order of the British Consul, to the authorities of His Highness the Sultan for trial and punishment. Article 15. Should a subject of Her Majesty residing in the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muskat be adjudicated bankrupt, the British Consul shall take possession of, recover, and realise all available property and assets of such bank rupt, to be dealt with and distributed according to the provisions of English Bankruptcy Law. Article 16. Should a subject of His Highness the Sultau of Muskat resist or evade payment of the just and rightful claims of a British subject, the autho rities of His Highness the Sultan shall afford to the British creditor every aid and facility in recovering the amount due to him. In like manner the British Consul shall afford every aid and facility to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muskat in recovering debts justly due to them from a British subject.In like manner, the British Consul shall afford every aid and facility to subjects of His Highness, in recovering debts, justly due to them from a British subject. ^ N otes (1) and (2). The invariable replies given alread y to the just demands of British subjects . Th e office files are full of such lying pretensions and 1 hav e two cases pending now before me, in one of which a man, possessing a date-garden, pleads inability to pay a trifling debt not one-tenth of its value and is consistently supported by His Highness and his officials. In the other, a debtor, possessed of similar valuable property at the time of a lo an not eighteen months old, has disposed of that property by a friendly family agreement ancL the creditor is apparently powerless against this palpably shady transaction. Cheating bankrupts are common everywhere, but this cynical support o f their fraudulent devices is most discreditable to His Highness. To legalise these flimsy excuses would be dan gerous in the extreme . (3) Tide note (2) to Article IV. Article XVII.

Should a British subject die within the domi nions of His Highness the Sultan of Muskat, or dying elsewhere leave property therein, moveable or immoveable, the British Consul shall be autho rised to collect, realise, and take possession of the estate of the deceased, to be disposed of according to the provisions of English law. Article 18. The houses, dwellings, warehouses, and other premises of British subjects, or ot persons actually in their regular service, within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muskat, shall not be entered, or searched under any pretext, by the officials of His Highness without the consent of the occupier, unless with the cognizance and assistance of the British Consul or his substitute. Article 19. It is hereby agreed between the two High Contracting Parties that, in the event of an agree ment being hereafter arrived at between His Highness the Sultan of Muskat and the various Powers with which His Highness shall be in Treaty relations, including Great Britain, which must be a consenting party, whereby the resi dents of a district or town shall, without distinc tion of nationality, be made subject to the pay ment of local taxes, for municipal and sanitary purposes, the same to be fixed and administered by or under the control of a special Board, nothing contained in this Treaty shall be understood so as to exempt British residents from the payment of such taxes. Article 20. Subjects of the two High Contracting Parties shall, within the dominions of each other, enjoy freedom of conscience and religious toleration, the free and public exercise of all forms of religion, and the right to build edifices for religious wor ship.15 Article XXI. As per commercial Treaty of 1891. No culty anticipated in necessary alterations. diffi- Article XXII. Omitted in His Highness’s draft. There may be some difficulty in getting him to accept from the semi-colon in 3rd line to full stop of 5th line, which, in present state of Eastern opinion, may be considered insulting. I presume this customary provision must be insisted upon ? though I am personally inclined to think this is unnecessary. No other difficulty should present itself over the acceptance of the rest of this purely formal Article. Article XXIII. Should also present no difficulty, though it has been omitted by His Highness from his draft. Article 21. The stipulations of the present treaty shall be applicable to all the Colonies and foreign posses sions of Her Britannic Majesty so far as the laws permit, excepting to those hereinafter named, that is to say, except to— The Dominion of Canada. Newfoundland. The Cape of Good Hope. Natal. New South Wales. Victoria. Queensland. Tasmania. South Australia. Western Australia. New Zealand. Provided always that the stipulations of the present Treaty shall be made applicable to any of the above-named Colonies or foreign possessions, on whose behalf notice to that effect shall have been given by Her Britannic Majesty’s Represent ative in Muskat to His Highness the Sultan within two years from the date of exchange of the ratifications of the Present Treaty. Article 22. The Present Treaty has been executed in quadruplicate, two copies being written in English and two in Arabic. These are understood to be of similar import and significations ; in the event, however, of doubt hereafter arising as to the proper interpretation of the English or Arabic text of one or other of the Treaty stipulations, the English text shall be considered decisive. The Treaty shall come into operation within one month after the date when the ratifications may take place. Article 23. After the lapse of twelve years from the date on which the Treaty shall come into force, and on twelve months’ notice given by either party, this Treaty shall be subject to revision by Pleni potentiaries appointed on both sides for this purpose, who shall be empowered to decide on and adopt such amendments as experience shall proved to be desirable.

McMahon, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending witl No. 903, dated 22nd April 1906, on the subject of the revision of 2. His Highness the Sultan was informed at the beginning of 1905 of his own position and ours with reference to the termination or revision of the treaty at 12 months’ notice by either side, and some informal communications were in progress between him and the Political Agent at the end of 1904 regarding items which might need modification ; hut these were dropped after receipt of Foreign Department telegram No. 493-E.B, dated 3rd February 1905, and have not since been resumed by either party^ We having remained silent, © firstly, because the progress of the Hague Arbitration in the French Flag Case made the juncture inconvenient for discussing anew Treaty, and, subsequently, because of the developments of the Arms Traffic difficulty and the hope of coming to some understanding with France, which would admit of the inclu sion of some provisions for prohibiting or regulating that traffic. 3. It transpired, however, in the course of an exchange of communications which the Political Agent recently had with the Sultan, in connection with a complaint regarding the levy of duty on the Batineh coast (which has been settled for the time being and with which it is not necessary to trouble Govern ment), that His Highness had been under the impression that the Treaty of 1891 had lapsed, and that, pending the execution of a new one, the terms of the old instrument were not strictly speaking binding on him. Major Trevor, however, explained to him that that was not the case, as neither party had given any formal notice in the direction of termination or revision. His Highness accepted that position, but at the same time gave formal notice of 1 • • . ^ /-'.n TTT-lI-Vnn fVl O I' TIT 01 IT Maskat letter No. 1541 , dated 27th November months ending 22nd November 1911. 1910, with enclosures. 4. From our own point of view, it would have been convenient if the &lt; discussions preliminary to revision could have been postponed for some time longer, in case any adjustment of the Arms Traffic question and understanding with France should be achieved in the next few months.^ As, however, the Sultan has now himself presented his formal request for rev ision, and promises to inform us of the changes he desires, I presume we must proceed with the 5. Judging from a rough memorandum of the points on which^ he was anxious for revision, which he gave the Political Agent informally in 1905, and which he now wishes to treat as a basis of discussion, it w T ould appear that many of His Highness’s provisional desiderata are either unsuitable lor inclu sion in a treaty or will prove possible of elimination after preliminary dis cussion. Subject, therefore, to the approval of the Government ol India, 1 am instructing the Political Agent to proceed to discuss these proposals with His Highness, and in due course to submit the residue m a suitable torm lor consideration by Government. p rom Major A.

This treaty, of which a copy 1 b annexed, has hitherto been kept out of 'State Papers' and 'Hertslet's Treaties' because it has not been published officially or laid before Parliament. The fact of its existence, and its purport, has now become public; and it is therefore submitted that the India Office should be asked if they have any ob jection to its publication in future volumes of 'State Papers' and 'Hertslet's Treaties', in which similar Treaties with the Trucial Chiefs of the Persian Gulf are included. It should appear in both these works un less there is some object in withholding it. It is referred to in the Despatch from the Govern ment of India, dated September 21st, 1899.

The exception referred to is in regard to Article III, respecting the appointment of Consuls. We consider that British Indian interests in this respect are adequately protected by the already existing limitation of Omani Consuls’ right of residence in India to “ wherever the interests of commerce may require the presence of such officers and we do not therefore think it necessary to risk exciting the Sultan’s suspicion by pro posing a change in the wording of the Article which might appear to His Highness to involve a diminution of his present rights.3 .

It is agreed and under&gt;tood by the High Contracting Parties that, in the event of an arrangement being entered into hereafter between His Highness the Sultan and the powers having treaty relations with Maskat, and to which Great Britain sh ill be a consenting party, whereby vessels entering the port of Maskat shall be charged with shipping, tonnage, harbour, or any other dues, such dues to be administered under the control of a special Board for the im provement of the harbour and the construction and maintenance of lighthouses, or other similar works ; nothing in the afore-mentioned provisions shall be con strued so as to exempt British vessels from payment of suek shipping, tonnage, harbour or other dues as may hereafter be agreed upon.. Aeticle IX. The duties leviable under Article VI of this treaty shall be payable in \ c un -which is legal tender in British India, unless, by common consent of the trader and of the authorities of His Highnes’s Customs House, it is agreed in / any case to satisfy all dues by delivery of one-twentieth part of the imported goods. The value of all goods on which duty is to he levied shall bo calculated according to the local cash prices ruling at the date of levy. In the event of any dispute arising between a British subject and the Custom House authorities regarding the value of goods imported, this shall be determined by the Custom House authorities purchasing the goods at the trader’s valuation plus ten per cent. Aeticle X. His Highness the Sultan engages by the present treaty to secure that the movement of goods in transit shall not be obstructed or delayed in a vexatious manner by unnecessary Customs formalities and regulations, cind that e\ery facility will he given for their transport, landing, and handling, and that standard scales and weights shall be provided Tor the weighment of merchandise at all Oman ports where British traders resiue. Article XI. British vessels entering a port in the dominions of His Highness the Sultan in distress shall receive from the local authorities all necessary aid to enable them to revictual and refit so as to procee 1 on their voyage.

Likewise, should a vessel of His Highness, or of one of his subjects, enter a British port in distress or be wrecked off the coast of His Majesty’s dominions, the like help and assistance shall be rendered by the British authorities. Article XII. Should sailors, or others, belonging to a British ship of war or merchant vessel, desert and take refuge on shore or on board of any of His Highness’s ships, the authorities of His Highness shall, upon request of a Consular official or in his absence, of the captain of the ship or his representative, take the necessary steps in order to have the m arrested and deliven d over to the Consular official or to the captain.

The trial and also the punishment of all offences and crimes of which British subjects may be accused within the dominions of His Highne. s, also the hearing and settlement of all civil questions, claims, or disputes in which they are the defendants, is expressly reserved to the British Consular authorities and Courts, and removed from the jurisdiction of His Highness. Should disputes arise between subjects of His Highness or any non-Chris tian Power not represented by a Consul at Maskat, and a British subject, in which the British subject is the plaintiff or complainant, the matter shall be brought before and decided by the highest authority of the Sultan, or some person specially delegated by him and approved by His Majesty’s Consul for this purpose. The proceedings and final decision in such a case shall not, however, be considered legal, unless notice has been given and an opportunity afforded for the British Consul or his substitute to attend at the hearing and final decision. Article XIV. Subjects of His Highness the Sultan, or of any non-Christian Power, not represented by a Consul at Maskat, who are in the regular service of British subjects within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, shall enjoy the same privileges as British subjects themselves. Should they be charged with having committed a crime or serious offence against the Sultan’s Government or subjects of His Highness not being in regular British employ, they shall, on sufficient evidence being shown to justifv further proceedings be handed over by their British employers, or by order of the British Consul, to the authorities‘of His Highness for trial and punishment.

In like manner the British Consul shall afford every aid and facility to subjects of His Highness, in recovering debts justly due to them from a British subject. In cases where defendants, subjects of either of the two High Contracting Parties, shall plead insolvency, a mixed committee, composed of not less than three and not more than five respectable merchants, to be agreed upon between His Highness and the British Consul, shall be appointed to verify and certify the bond fide of such insolvency before it is accepted as a fact by His Highness or the British Bepresentative. 1 Article XYII.

The houses, dwellings, warehouses, and other premises of British subjects, or of persons actually in tiieir regular service, withiu the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, shall not be entered, or searched under any pretext, by the officials of His Highness without the consent of the occupier, unless with the cognisance and assistance of the British Consul or his substitute. Article XIX. It is hereby agreed between the two High Contracting Parties that, in the event of an agreement being hereafter arrived at between His Highness the Sultan and the various Powers with which His Highness shall be in treaty relations, including Great Britain, which must be a consenting party, whereby the residents of a district or town shall, without distinction of nationality, be made subject to the payment of local taxes for municipal and sanitary purposes, the same to be fixed aud administered by, or under the control of, a special Board, nothing contained in this treaty shall be understood so as to exempt British residents from the payment of such taxes as may in like circumstances be payable by the subjects of His Highness.

It is understood that, under the provisions of this article. His Majesty’s Government can, in the same manner, give notice of adhesion on behalf of any | British Protectorate or sphere of influence, or on behalf of the Island of Cyprus in virtue of the Convention of the 4 th June 1878 , between Great Britain and Turkey. His Britannic Majesty’s Government shall have also the right to terminate j separately the present Treaty at any time on giving 12 months’ notice to that effect, on behalf of any British Colony, possession, or. dependency, as specified in this Article which may have acceded thereto.It is further agreed that during the existence of the present Commercial Treaty the goods produced or manufactured in, and vessels belonging to, any part of the British Empire shall enjoy in the Dominions of His Highness complete and unconditional most-favoured nation treatment so long as such possession, Colony or Protectorate shall accord to the goods and vessels of Maskat treatment as favourable as it gives to the goods, the produce or manu facture or the vessels of any other foreign country. Article XXII. The present treaty has been executed in quadruplicate, two copies being written in English and two in Arabic. These are understood to he of similar import and signification; in the event, however, of doubt hereafter arising as to the proper interpretation of the English or Arabic text of one or other of the treaty stipulations, the English text shall he considered decisive. The present Treaty shall he ratified and the ratifications shall be exchanged at Maskat within six months of this day of signature. The treaty shall come into operation within one month after the date when the ratifications may take place. Article XXITI. After the lapse of tgja years from the date on which this treaty shall come into force, and on 12 months notice given by either party, this treaty shall be subject to revision by Plenipotentiaries appointed on both sides for this purpose, who shall be empowered to decide on and adopt such amend ments as experience shall prove to be desirable.

I have the honour to forward a copy of Foreign Department letter No. 452 -E.B., dated 1st February 1905 , regarding jurisdiction at Maskat over the subjects of Christian Powers having no Consular representation in the Sultan’s territory, and to add the following remarks with reference thereto. 2 . On page 11 of the draft Maskat case for the Hague Arbitration, of which you have received a copy under this office endorsement No. 7 of 28 th January, it is stated, with myself as authority, that there have been up to the present very few French citizens in Maskat, and that at the time when the case for arbitration arose there was in Oman only one French citizen (Goguyer) outside the Consular Establishment aud “one citizen of a Christian State not having a Consul at Maskat who was treated as being under the French Consul.” The person referred to was the late Monsieur Bevidion, the Russian Armenian, and representative of the Odessa firm of Kover Rott &amp; Co. 3 . As far as I remember this individual, when he first came to open a branch in Maskat, brought credentials to the French Consulate and looked to that Consulate for protection in his business affairs. His title to protection by the French Consul, if he so desired, was not I think ever questioned by the Sultan j and while I was in Maskat never came into prominent issue. \V hen Bevidion was drowned last summer in Maskat harbour, I think I remember being informed that his effects were taken posses sion of and his estate wound up by the French Consul. In this the Sultan must, no doubt, have acquiesced. 4 . I would turn now to the clause on page 24 of the draft Maskat case wherein it is stated, though in brackets as if its inclusion was doubtful,^ that “the Sultan of Maskat has always been prepared to accept French jurisdic tion as attaching to subjects of a Christian Power not having a Consul at Maskat, who have registered themselves at the French Consulate there. The words “has always been” seems^little sweeping from the fact that cases in point have been so extremely rare. In my own experience I can only remember one other instance besides the case of Bevidion, of a foreign subject taking advantage of the good offices or protection of the French Consulate, namely, that of Count (or Major) Leontieff and a companion who paid a visit to Maskat about three years ago, and, if I remember right, approached the Sultan always through the French Consul. ^ # 5 . With regard to the concluding paragraph of the Foreign Department letter under reference, I have no knowledge of the Sultan ever having actively indicated his preparedness in the direction suggested.I take it, however, that unless h e special reasons for ohjectin? and resisting 1 in a particular case, he Would tacitly accept without question the protection or, at all events, the good offices of any of the Foreign Consuls at Maskat in favour of the subject of a Christian power not Consularly represented. 6 . The foregoing observations have been set down from memory, and can only be checked from the Maskat records. I have the honour to request that you will do this, and that after adding any further information which you may be in possession of, you will submit the result, together with your own views, direct to Government, sending a copy to me. As you will probably he absent for some time after this letter reaches Maskat, I am sending a copy of it to the Foreign Department as an ad interim reply to their reference.BsasOBMEISni No. 113, dated Maskat, the 27th February 1905 (Confidential). To-The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. Persian Gulf to my address, a copy of which he has forwarded to you. 2 . The case of Mr. Bedevian (not Bevidion) to which Major Cox refers TO T\ 1 Q 1T10/i I rA 1 Lr* Vv T-r 4-V\ /-v » i. I- • mm. - is explained, I think, by the fact that he was a Russian subject and the repre sentative of a Russian firm, and as such, rightly or wrongly, looked for protec tion to the Consul of the allied Power in the absence of a representative of his own Government. On Bedevian’s decease his affairs were wound up by the French Vice-Consul, and this course was accepted by the Sultan, who doubt less saw no reason to interfere so long as the debts of the deceased were duly paid. Bedevian s successor avails himself of the assistance of the French Consulate w r hen necessary. The case of this Russian firm is the only one in which subjects of Christian Powers resident in Maskat, other than Frenchmen, have been protected by the French Vice-Consulate. ^ 3. In regard to visitors, I find that the following Europeans, in addition to a few Frenchmen, have visited Maskat since the appointment of a French Vice-Consul:— (1) In September 1898 a Russian, name unknown, supposed to have been a spy. There is no record of his having visited either the Sultan or the French Consulate. (2) A German Muhammadan named Troeppen in March 1899, who does not appear to have employed the good offices of either of the European Consular officers. (3) Leontieff and his companion in March 1901. They were Russians who visited His Highness occasionally, and according to Major Cox were afforded good offices by the French Vice-Consul. (4) A Russian named Bagolochuski in July 1902. He stayed at the French Consulate for a week. (5) A German, Herr Burchardt, in March 1904, stayed for ten days at this Consulate. He did not visit the Sultan. It would appear then to be only in the case of Russians that any attempt has been made by the French Vice-Consul to protect or assist subjects of Christan Powers unrepresented at Maskat. The Sultan has never, so far as I know, indicated his preparedness to accept French jurisdiction over such subjects, and though I have never conversed with him on the point, I am nearly certain that he regards the protection of the Kevorkoff firm by the French Vice-Consulate with complacency on account of the Franco-Russian alliance. 4. ^ As the connection of France with Russia cannot contribute to her popularity among Muhammadans of the Sunni persuasion, I am of opinion that no harm would be done by allowing the representation of Russian interests in Maskat by the French Vice-Consul to remain uncontested; but, on the other hand, it would be prejudicial to our interests to allow him to pose as the champion of all Christian nations other than the English. This he has made no attempt to do up to the present time. 5. A copy of this letter will be forwarded to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

Sir:- I am directed by the Board of Trade to acknow ledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th ultimo (No.123) with its enclosures, relative to the revision of the Commercial Treaty between this country and Mus cat, and asking for the observations of the Board thereupon. In reply, I am to state that, in addition to the points to which the attention of the India Office has been called in Sir E. Gorst/s letter of the 11th ul timo, the Board consider that some modifications are required in respect of the following articles:- Article IV. The Board note that there is no pro vision in this article with regard to coasting trade, and they are of opinion that it is highly desirable, if possible, to keep open the coasting trade of the Muscat ^ ne Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.Muscat region and at the same time to reserve free dom of action as regards British coasting trade. They would therefore suggest t subject to Lord Lans- downe's approval, that the following words should be added at the end of the first clause of this ar ticle, namely:- •The coasting trade of Muscat and Oman shall remain open to British vessels Article VI. Clauses 1 and 2. The Board are also of opinion that some alterations should be made in the wording of the first 2 clauses of this arti cle, so as to remove any possible ambiguity as to the duties leviable on British goods. They would t suggest that these clauses should be modified to read as follows:- f His Highness the Sultan shall be permit ted to levy a duty of entry, not exceeding 5 per cent, on the value of all goods and mer chandise, of whatever description, imported by sea from foreign countries into His Highness's dominions. This duty shall be paid at that port in His Highness's dominions where the goods are first landed; and, on payment there of, such goods shall thereafter be exempt, within the Sultan's dominions, from all other duties(Signed) H. Llewellyn Smith duties ot* taxes, levied by, oi* on behalf of, the Government of His Highness the Sultan, by whatever names these may be designated; and no higher im port duties shall be levied on goods of British origin or claimed from British subjects than those which are levied on goods of other origin or paid by subjects or citizens of the most fa voured nation. The Customs duty, once paid, shall cover, from all other charges on the part of His High ness the Sultan, goods of whatever description coming from any part of His Majesty's dominions or the property of British subjects, whether these are intended for local consumption or for transmission elsewhere in bulk or otherwise, and whether they remain in the state in which they are imported or have been manufactured.'

I enclose for your Excellency’s information, copy of the papers* marginally noted, regarding a proposal to press on the acceptance of the Portu guese Government a draft commercial agreement between Great Britain and Portugal. 2 . I shall be glad to learn the views of your Excellency’s Government by telegraph on the question whether India should be a party to the proposed agreement. 3 . The considerations which have suggested themselves to me upon the subject are somewhat as follows:— India’s total direct trade with Portugal is small, only about 27,000/. (4,000/. imports and 23,000/. exports) on the average of the past five years ; As the draft stands it will apply to India, which may withdraw by giving notice within six months from date of ratification. If, however, India does not wish to accede, it will be advisable to say so at once rather than withdraw afterwards; The draft agreement will not affect Portuguese colonies ; In the case of the Belgian and German Draft Treaties I have found it necessary to require the addi tion to the treaties of certain declarations. Those declarations concern (1) the inclusion of Native States in British India; (2) power to control foreigners travelling or settling in India; (3) limitation of rights of foreigners in Native States, and (4) restriction on the appointment of Consuls. It seems to be advisable to require the addition of these declarations to all treaties to which India may hereafter be a party; but on this point I des*ire to receive an expression of the opinion of your Excellency’s Government. Article 5 bars the adoption of an alcoholic standard of duty on wine containing from 30 to 42 degrees of proof spirit. But that does not clash with the present Indian tariff, which imposes a uniform duty of one rupee per gallon on all wine 9577. I. 176. A(except champagne) under 42 degrees of proof spirit. Probably this plan of levying the Indian import duty is not likely to be changed. There seems to be nothing else in the draft agreement to which objection need be taken on behalf of India. The subject is not of great importance to India either way. But it is probably desirable that India should in a matter of this kind fall into line with the rest of His Majesty’s possessions, unless there be clear reasons for standing aloof. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) George Hamilton.ENCLOSURES. Enclosure No. 1. Eorei^u Office to India Office. Foreign Oflice, Sir, 21st January 1901. I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to transmit to you a copy of a Despatch from Her Majesty’s Minister at Lisbon, enclosing a memorandum by the Commercial Attache to the Legation on the subject of the projected reforms in the Portuguese Customs Tariff. Mr. Harrison observes in his memorandum that at the present time Spain, Holland, Norway, Sweden, Russia, Denmark, Belgium, and the United States have commercial conventions with Portugal, based on mutual concessions in favour of articles of special interest to those countries, hut that for Her Majesty’s Government there would he no object in entering into a convention on such lines. He suggests that the proposed convention, as drafted in May 1S9S, still remains suitable to British requirements, and he considers that as the projected minimum tariff is abandoned, there should he no serious objection in Portugal to an agreement on this basis. Lord Lansdowne would he glad to know whether the Secretary of State for India is of opinion that the draft convention, a copy of which is enclosed, might still he pressed on the acceptance of the Portuguese Government. The reference in Article II. of the draft to the treaties entered into by Portugal with the South African Republic and Orange Free State would, of course, now be omitted. I am to request an early reply. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State Martin Gosselin. for India. Annex 1. Her Majesty’s Minister at Lisbon to Foreign Office. No. 1 (Commercial). Lisbon, My Lord, 5th January 1901. With reference to my Despatch No. 13 (Commercial), of the 9th of October last, I have the honour to transmit herewith a memorandum by Mr. Harrison on the subject of the proposed reforms in the Portuguese Customs tariff. The Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. The question of reforming the Portuguese Customs Tariff and introducing a minimum tariff appears to have been abandoned. 9577. BAfter long discussion and the examination of reports from the 'Chambers of Commerce, it has become evident that the opinion of the influential commercial men of the country is strongly against any radical change in the tariff. The principal reason for this is that, in spite of the fact that the protectionist system was much exaggerated in framing the actual tariff, a steady improvement continues in foreign trade and the Portuguese home industries are still profitable to their owners, so that those interested prefer not to run any risks with new tariffs. It is probable, therefore, that no radical change will be made in the Portuguese tariff for the present. In these circumstances it becomes important that the most-favoured-nation treatment should he accorded to British trade. At the actual time, Spain, Holland, Norway and Sweden, Itussia, Denmark, Belgium, and the United States have commercial conventions with Portugal, based on mutual concessions in favour of articles of special interest to these countries. Although British trade with Portugal continues to be satisfactory, and the trade of Portugal with these treaty countries is not of primary importance to England, it is necessary that Great Britain should have the same trading facilities as other nations. With the large 'general trade bet’ween Great Britain and Portugal, it is undesirable to attempt to favour any special branch of trade at the expense of another, so that there would be no object in a commercial convention on the lines of those already entered into by Portugal with other countries. The proposed commercial convention, as drafted in A! ay 1898, still remains suitable to the requirements of British interests, and as the projected minimum tariff is abandoned, there should be no serious objection in Portugal to an agreement on this basis. The real difficulty appears to be the anxiety of the Portuguese Government to keep a free hand in the negotiation of commercial conventions with Germany and Erancc. These negotiations have long ago reached an advanced stage, but it appears that in Portuguese opinion the general progress made by the country in the last two years has altered the conditions under which they Avere being carried on. No immediate result can therefore he looked for. It is reported, however, that the German Go\'ernment is anxious to enter into a temporary commercial agreement for the next few years, and that the negotiations for this purpose, although approaching conclusion, aAvait certain modifications to be made in the Customs Tariff. The Portuguese Government may, therefore, be still unAvilling to conclude the proposed commercial convention with England. Under any circumstances, taking into consideration the present public feeling in Portugal towards England, and the fact that nearly one-third of the Avhole trade of Portugal is with Great Britain, it would be unfortunate to allow the settlement of the commercial relationship between the two countries to be indefinitely postponed. A commercial convention between England and Portugal is now the more urgent, as it Avould prepare the way for a favourable solution of the important tariff questions that must arise in the near future regarding ports, railways, and boundaries in the British and Portuguese colonies in South Africa. Lisbon, 5th January 1900.Z. ’ '■ ' The Marquess of Salisbury to Sir H. MacDonell. No. 11 (Commercial). Foreign Office, Sir, 7th May IBIS. I informed you in my Telegram No. 1 (Commercial), of the 6tli instant, on the subject of the commercial negotiations, that Her Majesty’s Government could not undertake to give an assurance that the duties at present levied on all Portuguese articles of import into the United Kingdom should remain unaltered during the continuance of the Agree ment, hut that they are prepared to assent to the exclusion of the Portuguese Colonies from its operation. With regard to the first point, you should explain to the Portuguese Government that, in agreeing to the terms of Article 5 respecting the duty on v ines from Oporto, Her Majesty’s Government have made a very large concession which, however, they are not in a position to extend to other imports. Their inability to meet the wishes of the Portuguese Government in this matter arises, less from the amount of duty at issue in the case of Portugal than from the consequences, involving the gravest incon venience, which the giving of such an undertaking would entail in dealing with other Powers under the most-favoured-nation clauses. Exclusive of wine, the total value of dutiable articles imported into this country from Portugal was (in 1896) under 112,000/., the duty on which was just over 31,000/. The value of dutiable articles, other than wine, imported from other countries than Portugal in 1896 was nearly 21,000,000/., the duty on which was over 20,300,000/. These figures are sufficient to show what a serious matter to the finance of this country would be an assurance such as is asked for by Portugal, which could and would be invoked by other countries in the same manner as Portugal has invoked the concession granted in 1893 to Spain. That concession, however, you should point out, was granted for a short period only, in a provisional agreement that lasted less than a year, and it found no place in the arrangement subsequently arrived at which is now in force. As reported in your Despatch No. 11 (Commercial), of the 7th instant, you have already explained to the Portuguese Minister lor Foreign A If airs that no hostile or differential legislation need he feared in the United Kingdom against the importation of cattle from Portugal, hut you may, if necessary, renew that undertaking officially, subject, of course, to the assurance Avhich was given to you by the Portuguese Prime Minister in August 1896, as reported in your Despatch Ao. 58 (Commercial), of the 3rd of that month. W ith regard to the second assurance desired by the Portuguese Government, Her Majesty’s Government would have preferred to see the Portuguese Colonies included in the Agreement, hut in deference to the wishes of Senhor Gomes, they are ready to consent to their exclusion. It would, however, hardly seem necessary to add a declaration to that effect to the proposed Convention, as the terms of Article 8 do not admit of the interpretation deprecated by the Portuguese Government. It is, as you are aware, the object of Her Majesty’s Government to secure, by agreement of the character contemplated, the stability of trade for as long a period as possible, and, for this reason, they would prefer that the instrument should remain in force for ten years instead of five. You should therefore endeavour to obtain the consent of Senhor Gomes to the last article of the draft enclosed herein. The other alterations which have been introduced are of a formal character and need not, I think, give occasion for objection on the partof the Portuguese Government, nor 'would it seem necessary to offer explanations on the subject, unless any questions are raised by Senhor Gomes. The word “ foreign ” has been inserted between the words “ favoured ” and “ nation''at the middle and at the end of Article d, in order to make it perfectly clear that the freedom of the Colonial Governments to make more favourable trade arrangements with the United Kingdom or amongst themselves than with foreign nations is not in any way fettered by the Agreement. The Lords Commissioners of the Treasury have slightly amended Article 5, with a view to giving better expression to its meaning, and the change proposed is merely for the purpose of making the meaning clear, without altering the sense. Article () has also been inserted in the shape in which it was last suggested by Her Majesty’s Government. The elfect of the Article, so far as Portugal is concerned, remains unchanged. You should communicate a copy of the draft agreement, as transmitted herewith, to the Portuguese Minister for Foreign Affairs and address a note to his Excellency, in the sense of this Despatch, adding the expression of my earnest hope that tho Portuguese Government will now no longer defer their consent to its signature. I am &amp;c., (Signed) Salisbury. Annex 1. Draft Agreement between Great Britain and Portugal. Article 1. The subjects of either of the High Contracting Parties Avill enjoy, immediately and unconditionally, in the territory of the other, the same rights and advantages as may be accorded to the subjects of the most favoured nation, as far as regards residence, whether temporary or permanent, trade, industrial pursuits, the exercise of any calling or profession, the acquiring, holding, and power of disposing of property, including the payment of general or local taxes.

Such subjects shall enjoy, immediately and unconditionally, throughout Die dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat and Oman, with respect to commerce, shipping, and the exercise of trade, as, in every other respect, all the rights, privileges, immunities, advantages, and protection whatsoever nature, which are, or hereafter may be, enjoyed by, or accorded to, the subjects or citizens of Maskat or Oman, or subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation. They shall more especially not be liable to other or more onerous duties, imposts, restrictions, or obligations of whatever description, than those to which subjects.or citizens of Maskat or Oman, or subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation now are, or hereafter may be, subjected. Article III. The two High Contracting Parties acknowledge reciprocally to each other the right of appointing Consuls to reside in each other’s dominions wherever the interests of commerce may require the presence of such officers ; and such Consuls shall at all times be placed, in the country in which they reside, on the footing of the Consuls of the most favoured nation. Each of the High Contracting Parties further agree to permit his own subjects to be appointed to Consular offices by the other Contraciing Party : provided always that the persons so appointed shall not begin to act without the previous approbation of the Sovereign whose subjects they may be. The public functionaries of either Government residing in the dominions of the other shall enjoy the same privileges, immunities, and exemptions which are enjoyed within the same dominions by similar public functionaries of other countries. Article IV. There shall be perfect freedom of commerce and navigation between the High Contracting Parties ; each shall allow the subjects of the other to enter all ports, creeks, and rivers with their vessels and cargoes, also to travel, reside, and pursue commerce and trade, whether wholesale or retail, in each other’s2 dominions, and therein to hire, purchase, and possess houses, warehouses, shops, stores, and lands, under the same conditions in all respects as subjects of their respective countries. British subjects shall everywhere be freely permitted, whether personally or by agent, to bargain for, buy, barter, and sell all kinds of goods, whether articles of import or of native production, and whether intended for sale within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat and Oman or for export, and to arrange with the owner or his agent regarding the price of all such goods and produce without interference of any sort on the part of the authorities of His Highness.

Article VI. His Highness the Sultan shall be permitted to levy a duty of entry, not exceeding 5 per cent, on the value of all goods and merchandise, of whatever description, imported by sea from foreign countries into His Hghness’s domi nions. This duty shall be paid at that port in His Highness’s dominions where the goods are first landed ; and, on payment thereof, such goods shall there after be exempt, whithin the Sultan’s dominions, from all other Customs duties or taxes, levied by, or on behalf of, the Government of His Highness the Sultan, by whatever names these may be designated; and no higher import duty shall be claimed from British subjects than that which is paid by subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation. This duty, once paid, shall cover, from all other charges on the part of His Highness the Sultan, goods of whatever description coming from any part of His Majesty’s dominions, whether these are intended for local consumption or for transmission elsewhere in bulk or otherwise, and whether they remain in the state in which they are imported or have been manufactured. There shall, however, be exempted from payment of all duty the following, namely:— (1) All goods and merchandise which are transhipped frorti one vessel to another in any of the ports of His Highness the Sultan, or which have been for this purpose provisionally landed and deposited in any of the Sultan’s Custom houses to await the arrival of a vessel for re-shipment to a foreign port. But goods and merchandise so landed shall be exempted only, if the consignee or his agent shall have, on the arrival of the vessel, handed over the said goods to be kept under Customs seal, and declared them as landed for transhipment, or re-exportation, designating at the same time the^ foreign port of destination, •and if the said goods are actually shipped for the said foreign port, as originally declared, within a period not exceeding six months after their first landing, and without having, in the interval, changed owners. (2) All goods and merchandise which, not being consigned to a port within the dominions of the Sultan, have been inadvertently lanoed, provided that such goods are within a month of being so landed re-shipped and trans ported abroad. Should, however, any such goods or merchandise, be opened or removed from the custody of the Customs authorities, the full duty shall then be payable on the same, (3) Coals, naval provisions, stores, and fittings, the property of His Majesty’s Government, landed in the dominions of His Highness for the use of ships of His Majesty’s navy.(4).

Article VIII. It is agreed and understood by the High Contracting Parties that, in the event of an arrangement being entered into hereafter between His Highness the Saltan and the Powers having treaty relations with Maskat, and to which Great Britain shall be a consenting party, whereby vessels entering the port of Maskat shall be charged with shipping, tonnage, harbour, or any other dues, such dues to be administered under the control of a special Board for the im provement of the harbour and the construction and maintenance of lighthouses, or other similar works; nothing in the afore-mentioned provisions shall be con strued so as to exempt British vessels from payment, of such shipping, tonnage, harbour, or other dues as may hereafter be agreed upon. Article IX. The duties leviable under Article VI of this treaty shall bo payable in coin which is legal tender in British India, unless, by common consent of the trader and of the authorities of His Highness’s Customs House, it is agreed in any case to satisfy all dues by delivery of one-twentieth part of the imported goods. The value of all goods on w hich duty is to be levied shall be calculated according to the local cash prices ruling at the date of levy. In the event of any dispute arising between a British subject and the Custom house authorities regarding the value of goods imported, this shall be determin ed by the Custom-house authorities purchasing the goods at the trader’s valuation plus ten per cent. Article X. His Highness the Sultan engages by the present treaty to secure that the movement of goods in transit shall not be obstructed or delayed in a vexatious manner by unnecessary Customs formalities and regulations, and that every facility will be given for their transport, landing, and handling, and that standard scales and weights shall be provided for the weighment of merchandise at all Oman ports where British traders reside. Article XL British vessels entering a port in the dominions of His Highness the Sultan in distress shall receive from the local authorities all necessary aid to enable them to revictual and refit so as to proceed on their voyage.

His Highness’s authorities shall further see that the British Consulate is at once informed of such disaster having occurred.4 Should a British vessel, wrecked on the coast of His Highness’s dominions, be plundered, the authorities of His Highness shall, as soon as they come to know theredT, render prompt assistance and take measures to pursue and punish the robbers, and recover the stolen property. Likewise, should a vessel of His Highness, or of one of his subjects, enter a British port in distress or be wrecked oif the coast of His Majesty’s dominions, the like help and assistance shall be rendered by the British authorities. Article XII. Should sailors or others, belonging to a British ship of war or merchant vessel, desert and take refuge on shore or on board of any of His Highness’s ships, the authorities of His Highness shall, upon request of a Consular^fficia), or, in his absence, of the captain of the ship or his representative, take the necessary steps in order to have them arrested and delivered over to the Consular official or to the captain.

British subjects shall, as regards their person and property, enjoy within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan the rights of exterritoriality.

The trial and also the punishment of all offences and crimes of which British subjects may be accused within the dominions of His Highness, also the bearing and settlement of all civil questions, claims, or disputes in which they are the defendants, is expressly reserved to the British Consular authorities and Courts, and removed from the jurisdiction of His Highness. Should disputes arise between subjects of His Highness or any non-Christian Power not represented by a Consul at Maskat, and a British subject, in which the British subject is the plaintiff or complainant, the matter shall be brought before and decided by the highest authority of the Sultan, or some person specially delegated by him and approved by His Majesty’s Consul for this purpose. The proceedings and final decision in such a case shall not, however, he considered legal, unless notice has been given and an opportunity afforded for the British Consul or his substitute to attend at the hearing and final deci sion. Article XIV. Subjects of his Highness the Sultan, or of any non-Christian Power, not represented by a Consul at Maskat, who are in the regular service of British subjects within the dommions of His Highness the Sultan, shall enjoy the same privileges as British subjects themselves.

Article XYI. Should a subject of His Highness the Saltan resist or evade payment of the just and rightful claims of a British subject, the authorities of HisHighness shall afford to the British creditor every aid and facility in recovering the amount d le to him. In like manner the British Consul shall afford every aid and facility to subjects of His Highness, in recovering debts justly due to them from a British subject.

O Article XIX.

Provided always that the stipulations of the present treaty shall be made applicable to any of the above-named Colonies or foreign possessions, on whose behalf notice to that eifect shall have been given by His Majesty s Represent- ative in Maskat to His Highness within two years from the date of exchange of the ratifications of the present treaty.6 Article XXII. The present treaty has been executed in quadruplicate, two copies being written in English and two in Arabic. These are understood to be of similar import and signification ; in the event, however, of doubt hereafter arising as to the proper interpretation of the English or Arabic text of one or other of the treaty stipulations, the English text shall be considered decisive. The treaty shall come into operation within one month after the date when the ratifications may take place. Article XXIII. After the lapse of ten years from the date on which this treaty shall come into force, and on 12 months* notice given by either party, this treaty shall be subject to revision by Plenipotentiaries appointed on both sides for this purpose, who shall be empowered to decide on and adopt such amend ments as experience shall prove to be desirable.

Maskat, 8 th (21st) February 1903. (From the correspondent of the “ Novoe Vremya ”.) The 20th February 1904 is a very important date in the history of the development of British power in Asia On that day expires the twelve years period named for the operation of the Treaty which was concluded on the 19th March 1891, between Colonel Ross, British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and Feysal-bin-Turki-bin-Saiyid, Sultan of Maskat, the ratification of which took place on the 20th February of the following year. The circumstances under which this Treaty was signed were as follows :— It is necessary, perhaps, to ascribe the termination of the absolute inde pendence of the Oman kingdom, with regard to the Anglo-Indian Government, to the 18th October 1856, when the great Iman Saiyid-bin-Sultan died after a reign of 50 years. Moreover, it should be remarked that for two years before his death he gave to his powerful ally a concession of no small importance, i.e., he ceded to them the island of Kuria Muria. On the death of Saiyid-bin-Sultan his dominions were shared by two of his sons, of which Thoweyni took the possessions in Asia, and Medjed those in Africa. Moreover, Thoweyni claimed suzerainty over the former African colonies of Oman. It was then that the Indian Government intervened in the relations between the rival brothers, supporting the younger Medjed in his resistance, and threatening the elder Thoweyni, so as to prevent his making the expedi tion which he was preparing to make against his younger brother. In the end the Anglo-Indian Government succeeded in pressing Lord Canning on the rival brothers as arbitrator in their dispute. On the 2nd April 1861, the decision was published, according to which the Zanzibar Sultanate was recognised as independent, but agreed to pay his former suzerain of Oman a yearly subsidy of 40,000 dollars. Thus England made a double step forward towards mastery of the most powerful of the kingdoms of Arabia and East Africa; on the one band, Oman, a country of poor soil with a trading and warlike population, though it received the subsidy (far from being assured for the future),—still lost the chief element of its power ; and, on the other hand, the newly constituted African Sultanate, rich, but with a slave population, while freed from one tutelage, was already doomed to fall under another and more strict one. The diplomacy of Napoleon III, who was then at the apogee of his power, began to look askance at England’s action, and less than a year later (10th March 1862) the French and English Governments signed a Declaration in which they mutually agreed to respect the independence of both States—Maskat and Zanzibar. However, not more than four years passed before the Negro State Zanzibar yielded to the necessity of becoming a vassal, and was under the thumb of the Anglo-Indian Government. Thoweyni, the Sultan of Maskat, died in 1866, and his African brother— Medjed—declined to pay the subsidy to his son and successor, - L ^ 0 y ears later Medjed yielded to the prudent and noble counsels of the Indian Govern ment, and admitted his liability to pay the subsidy; but in order to maintain his kindly dignity, expressed a wish—hardly on his own personal initiative—to pay this subsidy into the Anglo-Indian Government treasury in Bombay, which in May 1868, for the first time, paid the amount over to the Sultan of Maskat.This is the foundation on which, in “ Persia and the Persian Question ”, Volume II, page 413, the presumptuous publicist, who is now entitled “ His * English in the original. Excellency the Right Honourable Lord Curzon of Kedleston based his theory of the dependency of Oman. “ Oman may, indeed, be justifiably regarded as t Italics in original. a British dependency. We subsidised its ruler we dictate its policy, we shall tolerate no alien interference. I have little doubt myself that the time will some day come when, as these petty Native States crumble before the advance of a friendly civilisation, a more definite possession will he required, and the British flag will fly from the castles of IVIaskat ^ But we will not go further. Two years after 1868, occurred the eclipse of the Prench power, which lasted the third of a generation. Another 10 years, and on the 1st July 1890, England carried out a division of the Zanzibar territory with Germany. Such were the introductory events before the Treaty concluded on the 19th May {sic) 1891, between Saiyid Eeysal, Sultan of Maskat, and the agent of one of the successors of the Viceroy of India, who was the author of the award of 2nd April 1861, It only needed 30 years for this &lt;f high and righteous tribunal ” to appro priate not only the object of the litigation, but also the greater part of the belongings of the litigants. Pleased with this acquisition, it prepared to : English in original. acquire all that remained, basing its claims on inimitable “ bluff ”} {sic) expressed in the phrase quoted above—“We subsidise its rulers”! But the result, however, has not shown itself entirely such as was expected. As a matter of fact, with a boldness which is explained by their recent successes, the Indian Government originated a new Treaty, Articles of which release the Sultan of Maskat from his former obligations: in the 1st Article we read “ The Treaty concluded * * * 3i s t May 1839 is hereby annulled, and is no further in force, and the present Treaty, after ratification, shall take its place ’ \ But the Anglo-Oman Treaty of 1839, as also the Eranco-Oman Treaty of 1844, which still remains in full force, was concluded for an indefinite time. The new Treaty was concluded for a period of 12 years only, which expires next year. 1 The successor of Lord Canning, and predecessor of Lord Curzon, must have thought that he purchased at a cheap price the important privileges which this new Convention gave to the British Empire— viz., the admission of British goods in transit—an unusual concession on the part of the Sultan of Maskat, than whom no State in the world is more jealous with regard to his customs duties—and for the reason that these customs dues are the sole source of revenue apart from the Zanzibar subsidy, become a British “ subsidy ” by a stroke of the pen of an individual w T ho afterwards became Viceroy of India, and the master of this same subsidy, and always very prone to stop the payment, as was done in Eebruary 1899. In Article 23 of the new Treaty it says:—On the expiration of twelve years from the date of this Treaty’s coming into force, and on twelve months’ previous notice being given by one of the contracting parties, this Treaty shall be revised by representatives of both sides, with a view to such modifications as from experience may appear desirable. This point is still more clearly laid down in the Protocol of the exchange of ratifications, dated 20th Eebruary 1892. It is here stipulated that, in accordance with Article 23 of the Treaty referred to, each of the high contracting parties has the right, on the expiration of the twelve years, to terminate at any time the operation of this Treaty, on givin°* twelve months’ previous notice. It follows from this that, after the 21st Eebruary 1903 {sic), the Sultan of Maskat may, any day he likes, give notice of his wish to terminate the Anglo- Oman Ireaty, which in that case finally loses its effect 12 months after such notice.3 And the Sultan erf Maskat would not fail to take this step, were he well advised, and the following considerations laid before him :— “My revenue is approximately 500,000 francs a year—of which however, sometimes does not pay, often threatens not to pay, and always humbles me when it does pay. “ The other two-thirds of my revenue are received almost entirely from the Customs; but England and her colonies import almost exactly half of all the goods, paying, therefore, one of the two remaining thirds’’ (Administration Report on the Persian Gulf Political Residency and Maskat Political Agency for 1901-02, Calcutta, Thacker, Spink &amp; Co.). “ If I make English goods pay 10^ instead of 5^, then England will pay me two-thirds, and my Customs will yield the total amount of my present revenue (500,000 francs). Lord Curzon might then keep his ‘subsidy’ to himself, if he wishes. I shall be no worse off than I am now, and certainly in a prouder position. “ The French of Indo-China contemplate that their rice—I need 8,000 tons of rice a year—protected by such a differential tariff will easily set up a serious competition with the rice coming from Calcutta and Rangoon. A return freight is created for French merchant steamers, returning from the Ear East, calling in at my ports, where at present they are never seen. And even on their outward voyage to the Ear East, French ships would touch here, and bring manufactures which would also easily compete with similar English productions, which would have to pay double the duty. Then Indian rice merchants would soon give way before Annamese and Chinese dealers, w r ho are French subjects and who deal in French products. “ Thus there would be produced an entire change of influence. The more so, because Russia, w r ho spends a considerable sum in subsidising a steam-ship line from Odessa to the Persian Gulf, would not fail to find some means of benefiting by the privileged position of her allies, the French. “In this case, when once the English cease to import their wares, while the others continue to pay, as before, b% duty, it seems that my revenue will be diminished by one-third, i.e., by the sum equal to Lord Curzon’s subsidy. This will be unpleasant. “ But here is something which may get me out of my difficulties! I will ask my friends, the French and Russians, to agree to an increase of customs duties on their goods, up to 8^, which they pay in turkey, Egypt, and Tunis. I will, moreover, propose that they should make a treaty of alliance with me so as to guarantee the independence of my dominions. They cannot refuse to carry out my wish, because, if they did, I should be compelled to renew my treaty with the English ”. Many of the readers of this letter will doubtless be surprised that the French Consul in Maskat has not made efforts, in view of such manifest interests, which are even more serious than I can describe, to persuade the Sultan of Maskat to renounce, from this very day (20th February), the contract by which he is bound to the Anglo-Indian Government. My readers w^ould be still more surprised if I could write down how it is that the Sultan of Maskat has not himself, of his own initiative, even perhaps without the advice of a Consul, been able to make this easy calculation. But the reader hesitating between the suspicion of negligence or careless ness, and suspicions of a more serious character, may be reassured. There is some foundation for the hope that this mistake will be set right. • Rs. 86,UOO. £ j ,760 (sic). about one-third (146,000 francs*) is paid to me by the Indian Government, wLich, A. Goguyee.

I therefore request the favour of your enquiring from Government whether I should remind the Sultan on the subject, or wait till he moves in the matter himself.

The Sultan need not, however, he consulted at the present stage. 3. A copy of this letter has been forwarded to the Political Agent at Maskat to save time. Foreign Office Press—No, 923—26^*03—4ftNo. 198, daied Bushire, the 16th October 1903. From Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To L. W. Daxe, Fsq., I.C.S , Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. With reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No. 1874-E., dated 14th August 1903, on the subject of the Commercial Treaty with Muscat, I have the honour to forward copy of a letter submitted to me *by the Political Agent, Muscat, on the subject. 2. In paragraph 2 of his letter, Major Cox refers to certain minor altera tions in the existing treaty, the introduction of which appears to him to be desirable in the new Treaty. These alterations are set forth in the statement accompanying the Political Agent’s letter, and I beg to offer the following com ments upon them :— (1) My records do not show why no mention of Gwadur was made in the existing Treaty. I see that in the French Treaty of Commerce of 1846, the Sultan is styled in the Preamble as the Sultan of Muscat and other places, and that in Article I of the Treaty with the United States of America the words “of Muscat and his depen dencies ” are used with reference to the Sultan. In our Treaty of Commerce of 1839, the Sultan is styled, “ Sultan of Muscat and its dependencies.” The point, however, does not seem to he of any particular importance as in Article II of the existing Treaty and generally throughout the text, liberty of trade is ensured for our subjects throughout the dominions of His Highness. (2) With reference to Article 6, the spelling of the word f state ’ with a capital S in the copy of the Treaty which appears in Aitchison is .evidently due to a misprint which does not appear in the copy published by the Foreign Office. I see no objection to the altera tion suggested by Major Cox. (3) The suggested addition to Article 10 seems to be desirable from our point of view and the demand is a reasonable one. (4) I am not sure if the addition suggested in Article 14 can be approved. It seems to me to he hardly compatible with the independent status of the Sultan for a British Consular Court to claim juris diction over any of his subjects although they may be in the regu lar employ of British subjects. It appears to me that the Article, as it at present stands, is sufficient for its purpose and does not require alteration. (5) I am of opinion that the addition to Article 16 suggested by the Political Agent is very desirable. I do not see why the Sultan should object to the insertion of this clause which would certainly be in the interests of British subjects. 3. (1) With regard to paragraph 3 of the Political Agent’s letter, there is, I think, no doubt whatever that British subjects, although they may be in the service of His Highness the Sultan, are subject in all matters to the jurisdic tion of British Courts. The provisions of Articles XIII and XIV of the Treaty are sufficiently explicit on this point. (2) The question whether the declaration of 1891 should be included as an Article of the new Treaty does not appear to require any comment by me. It is a matter for the decision of the Government of India whether such a declaration can properly find a place in a Treaty of Commerce. (3) Alienation of the Mnsrat Customs. —I think that a declaration by the Sultan of the nature suggested by the Political Agent would be advantageous to our interests, hut I am doubtful whether such a declaration can suitably be included in the Treaty. It might, it seems to me, be made the subject of a separate Agreement to be executed at the same time as the Treaty of Commerce. 11(4) Major Cox refers to the question of introducing into the new Treaty some provision whereby our position with regard to the arms trade whould be improved, and he suggests that it shall he obligatory for all munitions of war in course of re-export by sea from Muscat or any Oman port to pass through the Customs House and to be covered by a pass setting forth in English and Arabic full details as to the brands, quantities and details of the arms shipped. I do not see why the Sultan should not introduce rules of the nature sug gested by the Political Agent if he is willing to do so, but I am again doubtful if such rules can fittingly find a place in a Commercial Treaty. I am also inclined to doubt whether any such rules will enable us to control the arms traffic in any way. The Sultan, too, if he anticipates any sensible reduction in the import of arms into Muscat, can hardly be expected to consent to a measure which will reduce his income unless we can promise him some quid pro quo. 4. Major Cox offers certain conjectures as to the nature of the modifica tions which the Sultan himself may desire. Firstly .—With regard to Article 9 of the existing Treaty, I am inclined to agree with Major Cox’s views on this subject, and I am of opinion that the provisions of Article 12 of the Erench Commercial Treaty (which by the way coincides with Article 11 of our Commercial Treaty of 1839) are both fairer and more practicable than the provisions of Article 9 of the existing Treaty. In the new Tariff with Persia no proof of value is demanded in the Customs Houses as regards articles which pay duty ad valorem and the Customs are not bound to accept the trader’s valuation, but if they do not accept it, their only course is to buy the goods from the trader at his valuation plus 10 per cent. This seems to me to be a very fair rule, and I mention it in case the Article which it is now proposed to substitute for Article 9 of the existing Treaty may be deemed to be somewhat cumbrous and old fashioned. Secondly. —With regard to the matter of “ Transhipment,” I think it is as advisable, from our point of view, as from that of the Sultan, that this ques tion should be put on a sound basis and that the wording of the Treaty should be relieved of all ambiguity. 1 think that the practice in force in British India, as explained in paragraph 3 of your letter No. 23b2-E.A., dated 21th December 1900, to my address, m’ght be introduced at Muscat, with such modifications as may be found to be necessary to meet local requirements. 5 . Major Cox next inquires whether it would not be possible for the Sultan to move for the abrogation of the Prench Treaty. He does this, I presume, with special reference to Article 11 of the French Treaty with a view to make the munitions of war illegal. I can offer no opinion on this point. I can think of no other remarks or suggestions to offer on the subject. No. 520, dated the 29th September 1903. From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul and Political Agent, Muscat, To— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to submit my views for your information on the subject of the renewal of the existing Commercial Treaty with Muscat in pursuance of Foreign Department letter No. 1874-E.A., of 14th August. I should have addressed you before, but that owing to frequent absences of late, I have had no opportunities of sounding local merchants or the Sultan. 2. The Treaty is generally complete and meets requirements but I attach a statement setting forth such minor alterations as occur to or have been sug gested to me, together with the considerations which have prompted them. 3. Apart from these suggestions there are one or two matters which it seems worth while bringing to notice at this juncture and with regard to which yourself and Government will be better judges as to whether it is expedient for, them to be dealt with by Treaty, and if so, in what terms. (I) The Sultan has a number of British subjects in his employ now-a- days, e.g.t in connection with the Customs Administration. 12If it goes without snying, as according to my interpretation it does, that sucli persons are in all matters subject to the jurisdiction of the British Consul just the same as British subjects not in His High ness’s employ then there is no need to include any provision in that direction in the new Treaty : and I may add that the ques tion has not been raised in any way during my term of service here, so that the insertion of any such provision now might seem to the present Sultan to be somewhat gratuitous. On the other hand, if it is not a well understood thing that we do not give reciprocity in this matter, and if from a legal point of vh-w, the absence of any special provision would enable the Sultan to claim reciprocity or to improperly protect any British subject in his employ against whom this Consulate had any Civil or Criminal claim, then it would be better to make the point clear by Treaty. (II) Beferring to the declaration of 1891, by which Seyyid Feisal engaged for himself and his heirs and successors not to alienate any portion of his territory except to the British Government, it will be observed in the correspondence preceding it that the late Marquis of Salisbury did not consider that such a course would he open to protest on the part of France as being a violation of the Declaration of 1862. It will be remembered, however, that at the time of the Bunder Jisseh incident, the French Consul did as a matter of fact impugn the validity of this declaration and was apparently supported by his Government. I am not aware what is the status of the said declaration at the present time, as between the French Government and ourselves, but it they'have had due notice of it and have not been able to establish any argument as to its invalidity, it might be considered desir able to° include the declaration as an article in the new Com mercial Treaty. (Ill) Alienation of the Muscat Customs.— It might also he possible to insert a declaration analogous to the foregoing by which the Sultan would undertake not to lease or mortgage his ( ustoms Bevenue to any one hut ourselves and not to employ in the direct or indirect administration thereof the subjects of any power save his own and those of the British Government. (IY) The question of the obligatory use of manifests for vessels exporting goods from Muskat has been mooted before {ride this office letter Nos 255 and 290 of 1887 to your address) and proved to he a failure, but it would he a pity that we should let the present occasion pass without devising some means by which our position in relation to the arras trade would he improved. If that is pos sible short of the abrogation of the French Treaty, I suggest some such’provision as the following : “ It shall be obligatory for all munitions of war in course of re-export by sea from Muscat or any Oman port at which Customs duties are or may in the future be collected by the Sultan or his Walis, to pass through^ the Cus toms House, and to he covered by a pass setting forth in English and Arabic full details as to the brands, quantities and details ot the arms shipped. The Sultan further agrees to cause to be kept up regular records and statistics of warlike stores so exported, and undertakes to place the information so obtained at the disposal of the Consular officials of Foreign powers accredited to him. I am doubtful whether the last condition would he feasible but it does not seem that the French could reasonably object to the rest. 4 I took a recent opportunity of referring incidentally to the Treaty course of conversation with the Sultan, and H,s Highness said there would one or two alterations which he would like made when the time came for \renewal, and when I asked in what direction, replied, “ Nothing particular or of importance ; only petty matters which we can discuss when the time comes.’* I can only offer conjectures as to the nature of the modifications he -con templates asking for, by attributing them to items which Uave from time to time in my experience been the cause of difficulty. Two such occur to me— Firstly .—Referring to Article 9 .—The option of paying in cash or in kind rests in our Treaty, with the British subject and the Sultan has from time to time complained that traders on occasion stand on their right of option and insist on paying in kind upon goods which cannot be divided without much waste of time, and for which, if the Sultan accepts the payment in kind, he has no ready means of disposal, or space for storage. The French Treaty of 1844-46 now in vogue leaves the option with the Customs Superintendent, and I think on the whole Articles 12 and 13 of that Treaty are of more practical expediency than Article 9 of ours, and that the adoption of similar terms might be considered if the Sultan raises the point. Secondly .—(Questions are from time to time being raised as to whether certain goods are in the status of “ under transhipment.’* Ote case you will remember was referred to Government (vide correspon dence ending with Foreign Department No. 2362-E.A., of 24th December 1900) and other cases have since arisen not quite analogous but in the same connection. His Highness will probably ask for some modification of the wording of the article in order to eliminate any ambiguity which may appear to him to exist. 5. I have the honour to enquire incidently whether it would not be possi ble for the Sultan to move for the abrogation of the existing French Treaty and substitution of a new one. So far as appears in the version of it in Aitchison’s Treaties, no limit of time is put on it, but surely it is understood that in the nature of things such Treaties become out of date, and it would seem to be a very reasonable thing for the Sultan to move for a revision of it on these grounds. 6 . In conclusion, I venture to express the opinion that the decision of the Hague Tribunal in the matter of the flag is likely to affect to some extent the attitude and temper of the Sultan in reference to any additions which we may want to insert in the new Treaty in the interests of British subjects, so that it might be well to adjust the date of the opening of negociations in connection with the Treaty with due regard to the probable date of the finding of the Tribunal ; that is to say, it would not be to our interests to discuss a new' Treaty just after the verdict of the Tribunal if that had gone against the Sultan ; and vice versa. Enclosure. Freatuble and Article I. —Was all mention of Gwadur purposely omitted in the existing Treaty. Article q .—The words : c&lt; * * and whether they remain in the State in which they “ have been imported or manufactured * are a little confused and ambiguous. The spelling of the word “ $tate *’ in the English version with a capital “ S ’* is misleading and I suggest that the sentence might preferably run thus : “ * * whether they remain in the condition in which they were imported or have since been subjected to local processes of manufacture.*’ 14■v r'' Article 10 —The following words might usefully be added after the word “ transport ” : — “ and that standard scales and weights shall be provided for the weigh* ment of merchandise at all Oman ports wherein British traders reside.’* Inconvenience is experienced by our subjects at some of tbe outlying ports owing to the absence of scales and consequent difficulty of arriving at the cor rect weight of goods liable to duty. Article 14.—The following words might be added after the word “ Them selves ” :— “ and shall be amenable to the British Consular Court in all matters in dispute between themselves and British subjects.” If that addition is approved, the ensuing paragraph of this Article might then run:— “ Should they be charged with having committed a serious offence against the Sultan’s Government or subjects, they shall * * etc. The position in this respect is not sufficiently defined at present. Article 16 .—It would be in the interests of British subjects if the follow ing clause could be added to this Article :— “ In cases where defendants, subjects of either of the contracting par ties, shall plead insolvency, a mixed committee, composed of not less than three and not more than five respectable merchants, shall be appointed to verify and certify the bond fides of such insolvency before it is accepted as a fact by the Sultan or the British representative.” It has been suggested by British subjects that there is a tendency with the local Government to accept without sufficient verification pleas of bank- rupty on the part of Arab debtors, who are sometimes believed, but can seldom be proved, to have hypothecated or transferred their property in order to be able to raise the plea and thus evade the claims of British creditors. 15 ^ J | * i i m. !No. 1885-E.

I am to enquire with reference to Article XXIII what period you would propose to fix as that after which it would be open to either of the contracting parties to claim revision of the Treaty, and if it would not be well to fix one period for the Treaty generally and another and perhaps a shorter period for the revision of the tariff.

They shall more especially not be liable to other or more onerous duties, imposts, restrictions, or obligations of whatever description, than those to which subjects.2 or citizens of Maskat or Oman, or of the most favoured nation now are, or hereafter may be, subjected. Article III. The two High Contracting Parties acknow ledge reciprocally to each other the right of appointing Consuls to reside in each other’s dominions wherever the interests of com merce may require the presence of such officers; and such Consuls shall at all times be placed, in the country in which they reside, on the footing of the Consuls of the most favoured nations. Each of the High Contracting Parties further agree to permit his own subjects to be appointed to Consular offices by the other Contracting Party provided always that' the persons so appointed shall not begin to act without the previous approbation of the Sovereign whose subjects they may be. The pub lic functionaries of either Government re siding in the dominions of the other shall enjoy the same privileges, immunities, and exemptions which are enjoyed within the same dominions by similar public function aries of other countries.

Article VI. His Highness the Sultan shall be per mitted to levy a duty of entry not exceed ing 5 per cent, on the value of all goods and merchandise, of whatever description, imported by sea from foreign countries into His Highness’s dominions. This duty shall be paid at that port in His Highness’s dominions w r here the goods are first landed, and, on payment thereof, such goods shall thereafter be exempt, within the Sultan’s dominions, from all other customs duties or taxes, levied by, or on behalf of, the Government of His Highness the Sultan, by whatever names these may be designated, and no higher import duty shall be claimed from British subjects than that which is paid by subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation. This duty, once paid, shall cover, from all other charges on the part of His High ness the Sultan, goods of whatever descrip tion coming from any part of His Majesty’s dominions, whether these are intended for local consumption or for transmission else where in bulk or otherwise, and whether they remain in the state in which they are imported or have been manufactured.

All goods and merchandize which are transhipped, from one vessel to another in any of the ports of His Highness the Sultan of Mask at, or which have been for this pur pose provisionally landed and deposited in any of the Sultan’s custom-houses to await the arrival of a vessel for re-shipment to any such foreign port. But goods and mer chandize so landed shall be exempted only, provided that the consignee or his agent shall have, on the arrival of the ship, handed over the said goods to be kept under Customs seal, and declared them as4 landed for transhipment, or re-exportation, designating at the same time the foreign port of destination, and also provided that the said goods are actually shipped for the said foreign ports as originally declared, within a period not exceeding six months after their first landing, and without hav ing, in the interval, changed owners. 2. All goods and merchandize which, not being consigned to a port within the dominions of the Sultan, have been inad vertently landed, provided that such goods are re-shipped within a month of being so landed and transported abroad. Should, however, such goods or merchandize, here spoken of, be opened or removed from the custody of the Customs authorities, the full duty shall then be payable on the same. 3. Coals, naval provisions, stores, and fittings, the property of His Majesty's Government, landed in the dominions of His Highness for the use of the ships of His Majesty’s navy. 4. All goods and merchandize tranship ped or landed for the repair of damage caused by stress of weather or other dis aster at sea, provided that the cargo so dis charged shall be re-shipped and exported to any foreign port and taken away on board of the same vessel.

Should a British vessel, wrecked on the coast of His Highness’s dominions, be plundered, the authorities of His High ness shall, as soon as they come to know thereof, render prompt assistance and take measures to pursue and punish the robbers, and recover the stolen property. Likewise, should a vessel of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, or of one of his subjects, enter a British port in distress or be wrecked off the coast of His Majes ty’s dominions, the like help and assist ance shall be rendered by the British authorities. Article XII. Should sailors or others belonging to a British ship of war or merchant vessel, desert and take refuge on shore or on hoard of any of His Highness’s ships, the authorities of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat shall, upon request of a Consular official, or, in his absence, of the captain of the ship or his representative take the necessary steps in order to have them arrested and delivered over to the Consular official or to the captain. In this, however, the Consular officer, captain or his representative, shall render every assistance. Article XIII.

The trial and also the punishment of all offences and crimes of which British subjects may be accused within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, also the hearing and settlement of all civil questions, claims, or disputes in which they are the defendants, is expresslyreserved to the British Consular authorities and Courts, and removed from the juris diction of His Highness the Sultan. Should disputes arise between subjects of His Highness the Sultan or other non- Christian Power not represented by Con suls at Maskat, and a subject of His Bri tannic Majesty, in which the British subject is the plaintiff or complainant, the matter shall be brought before and decided by the highest authority of the Sultan, or some person specially delegated by him and approved by His Majesty’s Consul for this purpose. The proceedings and final decision in such a case shall not, how ever, be considered legal unless notice has been given and an opportunity afforded for the British Consul or his substitute to attend at the hearing and final decision.

Article XX. Subjects of the two High Contracting Parties shall, within the dominions of each9 other, enjoy freedom of conscience and religious toleration, the free and public exercise of all forms of religion, and the right to build edifices for religious worship.

Newfoundland. The Cape of Good Hope. Natal. New South Wales. V ictoria. Queensland. Tasmania. South Australia. Western Australia. New Zealand. Provided always that the stipulations of the present Treaty shall be made applicable to any of the above-named Colonies or foreign possessions, on whose behalf notice to that effect shall have been given by His Britannic Majesty’s Bepresentative in Maskat to His Highness the Sultan within two years from the date of exchange of the ratifications of the present Treaty. Article XXII. The present Treaty has been executed in quadruplicate, two copies being written in English and two in Arabic. These are understood to be of similar import and signification; in the event, however, of doubt hereafter arising as to the proper interpretation of the English or Arabic text of one or other of the Treaty stipula tions, the English text shall be con sidered decisive. The Treaty shall come into operation within one month after the date when the ratifications may take place. Article XXIII. After the lapse of years from the date on which this Treaty shall come into force, and on 12 months’ notice given by either party, this Treaty shall be subject to revision by Plenipotentiaries appointed on both sides for this purpose, who shall be empowered to decide on and adopt such amendments as experience shall prove to be desirable.In witness whereof on behalf of His Majesty the King of Great Britain and Ireland and of British Dominions beyond the seas and Emperor of India, and His Highness Saiyid Sir Feysal-bin-Turki, G.C.I.E., Sultan of Maskat, on his own behalf, have signed the some and affixed thereto their respective seals.

With reference to yonr letter* No. 1885 E.-A., dated 14th June 1904, • pro. No. 122 in s&lt; cret e., July iao4, Nos. 118- before sending on the draft of the revised 12 treaty to Captain Grey, I venture to enquire whether, in view of the fact that His Excellency the Viceroy in his f Enclosure 1, Pro. No. 119, in Secret E., February replyf to the address of British Subjects 1901 , Nos. 33 - 127 . a t Maskat in November last mentioned that the Goanese community received protection in Maskat State—a fact which has not been since challenged—it would be possible to insert something to that effect in the treaty. Thus in Article II immediately before the first full stop, the following words might perhaps be interpolated—“ and as a matter of comity, Goanese subjects of Portugal (in the absence of any Consular representative of that Government) ”. In this connection I have the honour to refer you to Foreign j Pro. No. 87 in External a, August 1890 , Nos. Department letterJ No. 14G8 E., dated 84-88. 14th July 1890, to the address of Colonel Boss. The words in brackets might possibly be considered unnecessary. 2. Such a clause would form a useful piece of documentary support to claims on our part to protect Goanese in other parts of the Gulf. There are, I think, strong moral grounds why we should protect the Goanese as much as the inhabitants of the Native States of British India; but, as matters stand, the claim to do so is one which is always liable to be disputed, and in such cases the patent recognition at Maskat of their claim to British protection would conveniently strengthen our position in the matter. 3. In reply to the enquiry made in paragraph 2 of your letter, I have the honour to suggest that it would be convenient if the tariff were made subject to revision every five years, and the remaining provisions of the treaty after ten years. Having regard to the quickening pace and the present trend of Middle- Eastern politics, the fixture of a longer term than 10 years as qualification for revision would seem to be undesirable. 4. If the decision of the Government of India on the point raised con nected with the Goanese is in the negative, I request the favour of your tele graphing to me accordingly, so that I can send on the treaty to the Political Agent, Maskat, without further delay. If the insertion of the clause is at all within the bounds of possibility, I realise that it may take some little time before a decision can be passed.

Proposal to obtain from the TVith reference to my Secret Despatch’ Secretary of State for Eoreign Affairs has intimated to me that the ratification of the Commercial Treaty between Great Britain and Muscat would apparently offer an opportunity to propose to the Sultan a declaration in which His Highness should engage that neither he nor his heirs and successors would cede, mortgage, or otherwise give for occu pation any portion of his dominions, save to Her Britannic Majesty’s Government. 2. Lord Salisbury remarked that a precedent for such an undertaking is to be found in the case of Socotra,* and that he does not consider that such a course would be open to protest on the part of France, as being a violation of the Declaration of 3. Viewing this proposal as a step in the direction of the establishment of a British Pro tectorate over Muscat, I have informed Lord Salisbury that I concur in it, and I have to request that, when the ratification of the new Commercial Treaty entered into with the Sultan of Muscat is announced to your Government, the ncc^sary measures may loe taken for obtaining from the Ruler of Muscat a declaration in the sense desired.

With reference to my letter of the 16th instant, marked secret, I am directed by the Marquis of Salisbury to state to you, for the in formation of Viscount Cross, that the ratification of the Commercial Treaty between Great Britain and Muscat, which was enclosed in your letter of the 9th instant, would apparently offer an opportunity to pro pose to the Sultan a declaration, in which His Highness should engage that neither he nor his heirs and successors would cede, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation any portion of his dominions, save to Her Britannic Majesty’s Government. A precedent for such an undertaking is to he found in the case of Socotra (January 1876, «ee Hertslet’s Treaties, Vol. 14, p. 1002), and Lord Salisbury does not consider that such a course would be open to protest on the part of France, as being a violation of the Declaration of 1862. Detailed observations in regard to the ratification of the Commercial Treaty between Great Britain and Muscat will be continued in a letter which will shortly be addressed to you by Lord Salisbury’s direction, but in the meantime His Lordship would be glad to learn Viscount Cross’s opinion as to tbe expediency of the course suggested in the present letter.
