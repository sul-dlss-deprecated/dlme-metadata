Dear Colonel Fowle H A S A . (Aie have received Instructions from our London Principals to approach H.M.King Ibn tiaud for an option over territory similar in terms to that obtained by us (Vide our letter GM/811 of 1st Deptember 1932). the lias a in Qatar As this does not constitute a Concession, 1 trust we shall be in order in going ahead with whatever arrangements can be made to accomnlish this. Chisholm was here recently and returned to Kuwait yesterday. 1 have asked him to consult Col. Dickson as to whether Ibn baud's agent in Kuwait is a reliable and bona fide-s representative and if he is, to convey a message through him to Ibn Saud requesting the opportunity of an interview either with him personally or his accredited Representative. If this recuest met with a favourable reception we should send our small party (consisting probably of naj i Williamson and another) to the place nominated by Ibn ^aud. it has occurred to us that it might be as well to work through Ibn baud's Kuwait representative as we have reason to believe that his Bahrein Agent has already been approached by Major Holmes on behalf of his Syndicate. It may be, however, thatch is Agents in the two places are of the same family or trntifr and that our precautions will serve no useful purpose. •' .u;.! 1 should however be most grateful to your advice on our best means of approach to this problem and if you have any reason to consider some other initial moves would be more satisfactory perhaps kindly telegraph me on receipt of this letter. receive di fficuIt vou would Yours sincerely, Lt.
