They were prepared for me by Mr. Hemelik of International Aeradio Limited. I regret that it was not found possible to send them to you before the 15th November. Yours ever Political Agent, Bahrain The Civil Air Attache British Embassy, Be ghdad.Referring to paragraph 2 (Traffic Statistics), it is impossible to come to any accurate figure as the only records available are for passengers and freight of R.A.F. duty aircraft flying between Habbaniyeh, Bahrein and Sharjah-and B,0.A,C, scheduled aircraft on the U.K. to Bahrein route. As these movements are only an extremely small proportion of the total number per month, these figures would be of no use whatsoever. — —5 • Overflying aircraft. The following shows the number of aircraft per month which used Radio Facilities and Flight Information available at Bahrein : April ... 510 May ... 430 June ... ... 453 July ... 478 August ... 353 September ... ... 331 October ... ... 465 The facilities available are generally used by the vast o o majority of aircraft flying between 40 E and 60 E (Eastbound) o o and 60 E and 40 E (Westbound). The aircraft which over-fly are more or less equally divided between Charter and Scheduled services^although at night the WKtt majority is Scheduled. 6. Charter Companies.

The bulk of the file is a copy of the data subsequently sent to the Civil Air Attaché (ff 7-23). This information includes: total movements (landings and take-offs) by month (April to October 1948); numbers of passengers, aircraft type, air operator and country, and nature of flight (military, scheduled, private) for each month; airport revenue derived from landing, parking and hangar fees; and numbers of overflying aircraft using radio facilities at Bahrain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Civil Air Attaché, Baghdad</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000344#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
