Section 2 . [ 44632 ] No. 1. India Office to Foreign Office.—(Received December 9.) India Office, December 9, 1910. WITH reference to paragraph 5 of your letter of the 5th October last, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information o t e Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a telegram from the Government or India regarding the suggested conclusion of a treaty with the Sheikh or Sheikhs ot tea r. ^ With regard to the general question ot our relations with Turkey m those regions which this telegram raises, I am to say that the Earl of Crewe shares the views o is predecessor, as indicated in my letters of the 7th and 28th October last. , , . So far as the particular question of treaties with the Katr tribes is concerned his Lordship agrees with the Government of India that no advantage wou acciue r0 ^ n them (from the point of view of our relations with Turkey) unless the lurks can be induced to confine themselves to their recognised possessions m El Ratit. And as it would appear that if and when the Turks have been induced so to confine themselves the treaties will, from the international point of view, be no longer necessary, there seems to be no advantage in pursuing the discussion m the present connection. I am to take this opportunity of acknowledging the receipt of your letter of t 6th instant regarding Turkish aggression on British interests m Mesopotamia. In reply, I am to say that though Lord Crewe would prefer—for the reasol ? s , my letters above referred to-a eomprehensive settlement ol our dyerences w th TurW in the circumstances he readily assents to the proposal that His Majesty s ship “ Redbreast ” should visit the island of Zakhnuniyeh. He does not, however, imagine that the mere visit of the ship will restore British prestige in any appreciable measure and he would suggest that—if this result is thought necessary any furkisi Siers or flags that maf be found on the island should be removed , or that the “ Redbreast” should at least be accompanied by such other ships as can be spared fiom the blockade, and should cruise to the head of the Gulf and remain as long as possible “ ^in conclusion!Tam to say that Lord Crewe has learned with deep regret from the enclosures in your letter that'British Indian subjects have found it necessary to c ange their nationality in the circumstances described. This fact cannot fai o crea e a mos unfortunate impression in India, and constitutes a further ar ^ m ; ® nt gir I E'orey’s needed—for the firm and comprehensive policy that was ™ dlca H “ h ;„ office letter despatch of the 17th October, and advocated in the interests of India m this Office lett of the 28th October. j am £ c ’ R.

With the Young Turk regime the temporising policy which we have pursued for years past will not, it seems to be generally agreed, serve the purpose ; it is submitted that strong and imperative grounds for settling issues now are afforded us by assertive attitude of Turks and recent attempts to upset status quo. ^ a “ What is needed to clear the air is, from a local standpoint, as follows “ 1 . Our agreement with Koweit should cease to be kept secret, and our intention to make the agreement effective should be intimated to the Turkish Government. I strongly recommend that anomaly of Turkish flag at Koweit should simultaneously be eliminated, if this can be done. . . “ 2 . Turks should be induced to confine themselves to their recognised possessions at Katif and Ojair ; mudirates at Wakra, &amp;c., should be finally abolished ; and withdrawal of Turkish military posts from Jinnah, Um Kasr, Bubiyan, Zakhnuniyeh, and El Bidaa should be brought about by us. i j j i “ 3 . Item No. 2 having been achieved, treaties should be concluded by us with Bin Thani, and, if necessary, with other headmen on the west coast of Katr, on the lines of the trucial coast agreements. “It is beyond my purview to deal with question whether coercive measures will be necessary to achieve the above ends, or whether it is possible to achieve them by means of comprehensive reciprocal compromise. I beg to say, however, that there is no quid pvo quo in this sphere that I can conceive which could be offered to the Turkish Government in exchange for withdrawal of pretensions of Turkey. In some other sphere it might perhaps be possible to find such a quid pro quo. . ti • “ Should it be necessary to resort to measures of coercion, so favourable a juncture locally as now exists could not be expected ever to recur. Under scheme^ of Nazim Pasha for concentrating troops at Bagdad, the numerical strength of the military posts in question has just been reduced to a minimum; while it would be a simple matter for us to make a naval demonstration owing to the fact that we have a strong squadron m the Gulf in connection with the arms traffic. “ It seems essential that action should be taken now if achievement of above measures is ever to be brought about ; such achievement would completely consolidate our position on Arab coast and in the Gulf generally, especially in regard to the question of pearl fishery. Task may be rendered very difficult, it not impossible, m the event of action being delayed, by the suggested association of Turkey with the triple Alliance and increase of Turkish navy. In these circumstances, I respectfully urge the necessity in any case that, by one method or another, position with Turkey should forthwith be adjusted, and chronic elements of friction, which have now become dangerous, should be eliminated. I consider, on grounds explained above, that, unless we are prepared to conclude treaty openly, and to bring about, as suggested in item No. 2 above, the elimination of Turkish influence from Katr, the conclusion of a treaty with Bin Thani would now be useless. Existence of treaty would only be a source of danger to the Thani family from the present Turkish regime, and they themselves would fight shy of it, unless such action were taken simultaneously. We share the view of the resident that, unless Turks can be induced to confine themselves to their recognised possessions at Ojair and Katif, treaties with chiefs of Katr would lead to no advantage, and, moreover, that chiefs would probably not now agree to enter into treaties. 1 v ): Pu t f; If ♦ t r j %' ¥ M rB. 181. This Document is the property of the Secretary of State for India in Council. CONFIDENTIAL. British relations with Turkey in the Persian Gulf. Memorandum on Lieutenant-Colonel Cox’s telegram repeated in Government of India’s Telegram of 1 st December 1910 . The immediate question out of which this arises is the desirability of concluding a treaty with a Sheikh or Sheikhs of the El Katr peninsula as a bulwark against Turkish aggression. In a Despatch of 22nd August 1910 His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople had written: “ Should His “ Majesty’s Government and the Government of India now decide on the “ expediency of making such a treaty, there would seem to me no objection “ from the Constantinople point of view.” The Foreign Office referred to the India Office, the India Office to the Government of India, and the Government of India to Lieutenant-Colonel Cox. It will be convenient to take Lieutenant-Colonel Cox’s telegram piece meal :— 1 . “ At the present juncture f. find it difficult to discuss question apart from general Anglo-Turkish situation in the Gulf. In a letter just received Consul at Basrah writes that new Vali, when asked what action he had taken regarding Zakhnuniyeh, replied that the island is Turkish territory and challenged right of Consul to discuss it officially or privately. He added that he was astonished that Consul did not mind his own business which was trade. It is thus evident that communications made to Porte regarding^ recent incidents have had no effect, and it seems to me that position has become impossible and humiliating, and that unless atmosphere is quickly cleared frequent recurrence of unpleasant incidents is inevitable. It appears to be generally agreed that temporising policy, which we have pursued for years past, will not serve the purpose with the Young Turk regime, and Z submit that then assertive attitude and recent attempts^ to _ upset status quo give us strong and imperative grounds for settling issues nowT The general position is at present as follows. In then lettei of 4th October last the Foreign Office requested the observations of Viscount Morley on the terms of a draft despatch which it was proposed to address to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, “respecting the vexatious “ treatment of British subjects in Asiatic Turkey, and the number of “ incidents of political aggression which have lecently marked ^the conduct “ 0 f the Ottoman authorities in the region of the Persian Gulf.” The draft despatch, after enumerating the complaints of His Majesty’s Government, concluded as follows:— ... j* • c i “ These occurrences, which individually have been the cause oi pciiniui surprise to His Majesty’s Government, have produced in their cumu lative effect, an unfavourable impression as to the present attitude of the local Ottoman authorities,—an attitude which appears to be one of hostility and aggression. . , T . “ His Majesty’s Government cannot believe that this attitude has tiie approval of the Central Government, or is based upon their specific instructions I therefore have decided to instruct you to communicate a translation of this despatch to the Minister of Foreign Affairs in order that his Excellency may be fully apprised of the views of His Majesty’s Government and of their causes of complaint, in taking this step your Excellency should explain that His Majesty s Govern ment have decided to make friendly representations, believing that the Ottoman Government will redress the grievances referred to, for a situation of very considerable gravity would of couise arise if they proved to be the result of deliberate and unfriendly policy.” S. 41.Lord Morley concurred in the draft, remarking that he “ is in entire acord with Sir L. Grey in thinking that the time has come when it is necessary to “ give the Turkish Government a sharp reminder of the interests of Great “ Britain and India in those regions.” The despatch issued on 17th October IDJO. Then came the anti-British and pro-German explosion at Constantinople caused by the publication of a garbled version oC the British note to Persia regarding the restoration of order on the southern roads. The Ambassador took fright, and begged to be allowed to postpone communication of the despatch “until ill-feeling has died down” (Sir G. Lowther’s telegram No. 232 of 24th October); and the Foreign Office, without again consulting this Office, agreed (Sir E. Grey’s telegram No. 323 of 2(3th October). Lord Morley thereupon addressed a letter (28th October) to the Foreign Office, which was of the nature of a protest against this change of policy, observing that “ Sir G. Lowther’s telegram No. 232 of 24th October contains no “ considerations that could not have been foreseen when the despatch in ■“ question issued ” ; that the object of His Majesty’s Government is “less to secure an adjustment of the particular incidents, than to impress “ upon the Turkish Government, in a manner that shall preclude further “ misunderstanding, the importance which they attach to their interests in those regions, and their determination to see that they are respected ” ; and that the probability of attaining this object would be “ greatly “ diminished if the general protest is long deferred, and if His Majesty’s “ Ambassador proceeds by means of piece-meal representations in the “ meantime.” To this letter the Foreign Office have not thought it necessary to reply, and we are therefore entirely in the dark as to what their general policy is. II. “ From a local standpoint what is needed to clear the air is (1) that we should cease to make a secret of our Agreement with Koweit, and should inform Porte that we intend to make it effective. If we can simultaneously eliminate anomaly of Turkish flag at Koweit, I strongly recommend it.” The history of Turkish and British relations with Koweit will be found in pp. 155-160 of the Report and Proceedings of a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the Baghdad Railway, Southern Persia, and the Persian Gulf, dated 26th January 1909. We have two secret Agreements with the Sheikh. By the first, dated 23rd January 1899, he binds “ himself his heirs and successors not to receive the Agent or Repre- “ sentative of any Power or Government, without the previous sanction of “ the British Government,” and “ not to cede, sell, lease, mortgage, or give “ for occupation or for any other purpose any portion of his territory “ to the Government or subjects of any other Power without the previous “ consent of His Majesty’s Government for these purposes.” In return he is assured^of the “good offices of the British Government” towards himself, his heirs, and successors. The first of these conditions was inserted without the authority of His Majesty’s Government, and in approving it Lord G. Hamilton remarked that its “ operation, more especially with regard “ to the relations of the Sheikh to the Turkish Government, will require “ the careful attention of Your Excellency.” (Secret Despatch No. 11 of 30th March 1899). By the second agreement, dated 15th October 1907, we secured (a) the lease of a strip of land on the foreshore to the mouth of Bunder Shweikh ; (h) the right of pre-emption in sale or lease of certain other tracts, including “ the entire island of Warba, situated near Khor Abdullah and the surrounding foreshore.” The Sheikh in the same agreement confirmed the earlier one, and expressly included the Ottoman Government among the foreign Governments to whom he is not to alienate Koweit territory. For obvious reasons secrecy was necessary, but the German Government were informed confidentially of the second condition of the 1899 Agreement, and if they know of it the Turks certainly know of it also.It is not quite clear what Colonel Cox means by making the agreement effective. It is ineffective only in the sense that the circumstances have never arisen in which it would take effect. Presumably he means a making explicit of what is implicit in it, viz., a denial of Turkish sovereignty and an assertion of a British protectorate! This would have to be considered with reference to its effect on Germany as well as on Turkey. As regards the later agreement, there is the further difficulty that the Sheikh’s claim to the island of Warba is not indisputable, and as recently as March last Government of India, India Office, and Foreign Office were all agreed that it was inadvisable to take any steps to raise the question (S. 3130/10). As regards the Turkish flag, it should be explained that the Sheikh of ^Koweit has flown it certainly since 1871, and possibly since 1856. In 1901, when it was suggested by the Government of India that he should discontinue the use of it, Lord Lansdowne rejected the proposal, and was “ not prepared to support any action which could be interpreted as asserting the entire indepen- “ deuce of the Sheikh of Koweit ” (Foreign Office letter, 24th August 1901, S. 2251/01). The proposal was pressed later in the year, with the suggestion that the Sheikh should fly the plain red Arab flag instead, but the Foreign Office adhered to their objection (Foreign Office letter 24th September 1901, S. 2366/01). In 1901 the (government of India suggested that the Sheikh might retain the Turkish flag for use at Koweit and use a distinctive flag (he. a Turkish flag with the word “ Koweit ” written across it in Arabic) elsewhere (Secret letter No. 2247 of 8th December 1904), and this was agreed to by the Foreign Office (letter of 18th February 1905, S. 2653). The Sheikh concurred at first (S. 873/06), but later in the same year demurred, on the ground that it “ was sure to get him into trouble ” with the Turks, unless he was guaranteed by us against the consequences (S. 2010/06). The Government of India thought that this “might involve us in responsibilities of a somewhat extended character” (Secret Letter No. 193 of 27th December 1906, S. 2205). The Foreign Office were consulted (27th January 1907), and the Ambassador at Constantinople was not opposed to according this guarantee, thinking it “ very unlikely ” that the Turkish Government would interfere with the Sheikh’s action (Sir N. O’Oonor’s Despatch No. 105 of 18th February 1907); but the Foreign Office have never replied to our letter, and the question has remained in a state of suspended animation ever since. It will have been observed, from the passage referred to above in the Defence Committee’s proceedings, that the basis of our policy at Koweit has purported to be adherence to the status quo. This has been a convenient formula, but it is two-edged. The Turkish Government understand it in their own sense (and what that sense is is shown by the fact that they have made the Sheikh a Kaim-makam, and that they are applying the utmost pressure to induce him to register himself as a Turkish subject). We under stand it in our’s. One of the difficulties is to define our own meaning. Thus, the Foreign Office were parties to the agreement of 1899. Yet in September 1901 they declared that “ there does not appear to have been any “ period since [1871] when His Majesty’s Government have not been ready “ to admit at least the suzerainty, if not the actual sovereignty, of the Sultan.” (Foreign Office letter of 24th September 1901). For practical purposes the definition given by Sir T. Sanderson to Count Metternich a few days earlier seems sufficient, viz., that the status (quo is “ the Sultan’s authority as it exists in those parts.” Turkish authority “as it exists” is limited to the Turkish title conferred on the Sheikh (it may be noted that within the last few weeks the Sheikh has refused the offer of an allowance to accompany the title), the use by the Sheikh of the Turkish flag, and a Turkish guard sent to the island of Bubiyan, in violation of our definition of the status quo, in 1902. It would appear, therefore, that while there is nothing in the agreements that could not be made public without violating the status quo, we could not deny Turkish suzerainty if the Foreign Office view of 1901 is sound; nor could we assert a protectorate in view of Lord Lansdowne’s pledge to the Turkish Government in 1901 so long as the Turks themselves maintain the status quo (as we understand it), and do not send troops to Koweit. A further question is whether the despatch of the Turkish guard to Bubiyan Island does not absolve us from this pledge.4 So much for theory. In practice it will be observed that His Majesty’s Government have at times been inclined to go somewhat further. In January 1902 H.M.S. Pomone landed guns to protect the Sheikh against an attack threatened by the Amir of Nejd and the Turks, and His Majesty’s Government, in spite of Turkish protests, refused to remove them so ~ long as danger ol attack existed. And in October 1902 His Majesty’s Government, while refusing to give the Sheikh guns for his own use, under took to defend the Koweit district (understanding thereby the district adjoining or close to the bay) provided that he fulfilled his engagements and took their advice. Our definition of the status quo seems therefore in practice to receive this extension, viz., that we should deny to the Turks the means of asserting even such authority as they may possess. (2.) “ That we should (a) bring about withdrawal of Turkish military posts from El Bidaa, Babiy an, Urn Kasr, Zakhnuniyeh, and Jinnah, and (h) finally to abolish mudirates at Wakra, dee., and (c) induce Turks to confine themselves to their recognised possessions at Katif and U'jairT ( (a) As Bubiyan, Um Kasr, and Jinnah stand on a rather different footing from the rest of the places mentioned, they may be taken first. Bubiyan is an island immediately to the north of Koweit, between Koweit ba\T ancf the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab. It is claimed by the Sheikh of Koweit, mainly in virtue of the fact that some of his tribes (the Awazim) use it for fishing purposes. But in 19u2 the Turks sent a small guard there, and the Ambassador at, Constantinople was directed to protest. The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that he was not aware of the occupation of Bubiyan Island, though he knew that troops had been sent to Um Kasr; and he informed the Ambassador that the real motive of these proceedings was to keep a debouche for the Bagdad Railway under Turkish protection, as difficulties had been raised about extending it to Koweit (1912/02). In 1904 the Government of India recommended either that the Porte should be called upon to withdraw their post and that we should ourselves establish a post in behalf of the Sheikh at the northern end of the island, or that the Porte should be informed that w T e regard the island as belonging to the Sheikh, and that unless Turkish troops were withdrawn we should support him in establishing a post of his own (402/04). Sir N. O’Conor w ; as thereupon authorised to repeat his former protest, and, after an interval of some months, if the post had not been withdrawn, to inform the Porte in the sense of the Government of India’s second alternative (2065/04). The first part of these instructions was carried out, and as regards the action subsequently to be taken the Government of India made the following recommendations in their telegram of 20th June 1905:— “ Mnbarak welcomes idea of establishing post, on condition (Ij that British Government give him full moral support, inform Porte that they recognise his claim to Bubiyan, and support him in instituting post ; (2) Mubarak asks for following material support; (a) maintenance of Political Agent at Koweit as practically permanent; (6) occasional visit of man-of-war to Koweit and Khor Abdullah ; (c) contribution by British Government of Rs. 500 for erection of guard quarters, and Rs. 100 a month for guard maintenance. We regard these terms as fair, and advise full acceptance. Cost of (c) is less than subsidy sanctioned in your telegram of 17th January 1899. Sheikh suggests more than one post, and visit by Cox to Khor Abdullah should be sanctioned before number or location of posts is settled.” The Foreign Office thought that this went rather too far, and the question was held over for consideration by the Defence Committee in connection with that of the eventual terminus of the Bagdad Railway (3249/05). In September 1905 Sir N. O’Conor again spoke to the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, but without drawing a reply. In August 1900 the Govern ment of India returned to the charge (1372/00), and the whole question (which does not seem to have been considered by the Defence Committee) was referred to an inter-departmental committee (Foreign Office, Admiralty, and India Office), which, in its report dated 2nd October 1907, recom mended that “ if diplomatic considerations permit . . . the continued “ occupation of Bubiyan Island by a Turkish post, in derogation of the “ Sheikh’s territorial claims (which have been recognised and supported by5 | - I “ His Majesty’s Government), should he neutralised by the establishment “ forthwith of a Koweiti post, with the countenance of His Majesty’s Govern- “ ment, on Warba Island (immediately north of Bubiyan), or, if that should “ prove undesirable, on the northern shores of Bubiyan Island. If practi- “ cable we would even recommend the establishment of posts on both islands. We desire to emphasise the importance which we attach to the effective “ assertion of the Sheikh’s territorial claims to Bubiyan.” The Foreign Oilice accepted these conclusions (12th November 1907, 3903/07), and local enquiries were instituted as to the basis of the Sheikh’s claims to Warba. It appeared, that these were not very strong, historically ; but in view of the fact that it is separated only by a narrow channel from Bubiyan, it might fairly be argued on geographical grounds that the ownership of Warba followed from that of Bubiyan. The Government of India reported in September 1908 that the Sheikh was not at the time anxious to move in the matter of his claims to the latter, and His Majesty’s Government therefore decided to take no action (Secret Despatch No. 19, 30th October 1908), a decision which, as has already been mentioned, was reaffirmed in April last (Secret Despatch No. 9, 8th April 1910). To Um Easr the Sheikh’s claim appears to be much more shadowy than to Bubiyan. There is an old fort there, which is said to have been, built by his grandfather, but in 1904 it was uninhabited. On the other hand the Turks were reported to have little claim beyond that of actual occupation. The importance of these places is indicated by the following passage from the Government of India’s letter of 4th February 1904 : “ With the “ shores of the mainland and of Bubiyan Island in the possession of a single Power, the anchorages below Um Kasr and at Warba Island can at any “ time be converted into an impregnable harbour.” Jinnah has not hitherto figured in the correspondence, but it is an island lying alongside of the Island of Musallamiya, which is claimed by the Sheikh of Koweit. The Sheikh protested against the landing of Turkish troops on the latter island in 1902. It may be explained that the southern limits of his territory have never been defined, but the Government of India were of opinion that the Sheikh’s claim to Musallamiya could not be maintained, and that the island was clearly within the Turkish sphere of influence. (Telegram 10 th May 1902.) Of the other places mentioned as occupied by Turkish ^troops, El Bidaa and Zakhnuniyeh are south of the region known as El Katif, in wdiich His Majesty’s Government have recognised continuous Turkish influence. As will have been seen from paragraph 155 of the Defence Com mittee’s Proceedings, the southernmost point of that influence is Ujair. South of Ujair and on the El Katr Peninsula, His Majesty’s Government have declined to recognise Turkish sovereignty, but the Turks established a garrison at El Bidaa in 1872 and we have acquiesced in it. Zakhnuniyeh is 10 miles south of Ujair, and is claimed by the Sheikh of Bahrein. The Turks ran up their flag there m March 1909 and arianged to keep a guard there. The Government of India recommended that a protest should be made at Constantinople, and that the Sheikh of Bahrein should be allowed to fly his flag on the island (telegram of 23rd May 1909). Ihe protest w T as made and the Ambassador was informed in September that the guard had been withdrawn at the beginning of June. In these circumstances it was decided to drop the question of the Bahrein flag, the policy of His Majesty’s Government being to avoid disturbance of the status quo (telegram to Viceroy 13th October 1909) In November the Political Agent, Bahrein, reported that there were no Turkish soldiers on the island, but by April 1910 they had reappeared, and the Turkish flag was again being flown. Ihe Ambassador again protested, but received only evasive replies (telegiam o 16th August 1910). The subject was therefore included in Sir E. Grey's despatch of 17th October, to which reference has already been made, and the Ambassador was instructed “ to request that orders may be issued for t e immediate and permanent withdrawal oi the garrison. In a telegram dated 17th October 1910 Sir G. Eowther reported that the loite had instructed t le Mali of Basra that when the gendarmes left the island at the end of the fishing season they were not to return except under oiders fiom Constanti nople ; and on 14th November he reported that the gendarmes had deseited.and conjectured that tins was a Lurkish expedient for avoiding foimal with drawal. The Consul at Basra, however, reported on 27th October, that the \ 7 oli denied receiving such orders, and still maintained that the island belongs to Turkey. * El Bidaa is on the east coast of the Ivatr peninsula, and, as has already been mentioned, the Turks have maintained a garrison there since 18 1 2. Ihen nominal suzerainty has been tolerated, though no communication has been made to the Porte to this effect, but attempts to extend their control have been resisted. The garrison recently consisted of GO men and 4 guns. From all these facts may be gathered the degree of opposition to be expected if His Majesty’s Government announce at Constantinople their intention no longer to observe the status quo. (b) Wakra, Odeid, and Zobara are all on the coast of El Katr, a promontory south of the recognised Turkish sphere. In 1902 it was announced that all three were to be converted into administrative districts. The British Government had already forcibly dispersed a Turkish settlement at Zobara in 1895 as being dangerous to the safety of Bahrein ; and Odeid had been held for at least 30 years to be the property of the Chief of Abu Dhabi, with whom we have treaty relations. Accordingly m March 1903 Sir N.’ O’Conor warned the Turkish Government against making any admini strative changes affecting the status quo in El Katr, and reminded them of previous representations made by His Majesty s Government (e.&lt; 7 ., in 1883, 1893, and 1895). In reply he was informed that the question had been discussed at a Council of Ministers, and that there was no intention of sending mudirs to these places. Sir N. O’Conor had been unwilling to raise the whole question of Turkish sovereignty unless His Majesty’s Government were quite clear as to the policy to be pursued if the Turks—as he thought they probably would—merely reaffirmed their claims, and it was hoped that the incident was closed. But in the meantime a Turkish official had started for Wakra, and succeeded in establishing himself there, and His Majesty’s Government had to press for his withdrawal. The Turks dismissed him, but appointed a local sheikh (Abdur Rahman bin Thani) mudir in his place, and it was not till November 1904 that His Majesty’s Government succeeded in getting the post altogether abolished. In August last the Consul at Basra leported that a mudiv had again been appointed to Odeid, and Sir G. Lowther (Despatch No. 603 of 22nd August 1910) thought that this, along with their action at Zakhnuniya, pointed to “a determination to assert and extend Ottoman sovereignty m the neighbourhood of El Katr. He was instructed to hand in a written protest, “ pointing out that El Odeid is in the territory of one of “ the Trucial Chiefs wTio are under the protection of His Majesty’s Govern- “ ment ” and requesting that the appointment might be “immediately rescinded ” (Sir E. Grey’s telegram of 20th September). The Foreign Office at the same time consulted the Admiralty as to whether it w ould be^ possible to effect a landing at El Odeid for the purpose of expelling the mudir, if His Majesty’s Government should decide to resort to forciblme easures. The Admiralty in reply recommended that the necessary action should be taken by Indian troops, the part of the Navy being limited to assisting in the landing operations, and they pointed out that the employment of the Royal Indian Marine Steamer Hardinge in connection with the blockade should facilitate any action which might be _ necessary. The Turkish Government, however, replied that they knew nothing of any such appointment, and had telegraphed to the Yali of Basra not to make it, and to cancel it if it had been made. Local enquiry left little doubt that the appointments had been made both to Zobara and Odeid, although the new officials had not taken up their duties ; and on 21st October Sir G. Lowther was instructed to make a further protest, repeating that El Katr is “ outside Turkish jurisdiction.” (c) With regard to the limitation of Turkish authority to Katif and Ujair, Sir G. Lowther, in his despatch of 22nd August, wrote as follows : — “ As regards Zakhnuniyeh, El Katr, and Bahrein which in a way form one group, the active forward policy of the Young Turk Yali of Bussorah and the Mutessarif of El Hasa (Nejd) have already brought us into sharp .1 l KV V) conflict, and there seems no doubt that we should insist on Turkish ex | bn from the district south of Ujair. If the Minister for Foreign Allan , : '...er studying the question of Zakhnuniyeh and Odied and consul TVnihis colleagues, does not give categorical instructions for the non-interfq r ; of the Turkish local authorities, it would seem necessary, subject to y u ., uvs of His Majesty’s Government, to take a strong line. For, to th ash mind, Zakhnuniyeh is a sort of stepping stone to El Katr, and pe? ( y ‘wen to the Trucial coast. The Turks do not put forward any valk ‘ .s to justify their territorial acquisitions in those parts, but it is no ^ alt to glean that they base their claims on the fact that in the beg ; g of the 16th century a Turkish flotilla, under Piale Pasha, annexed .adur, in South Baluchistan, and sailed up the Gulf, compelling the . j Chiefs to acknowledge the sovereignty of the Ottoman Sultan and Ccdiph. They further feel that as the dominant Islamic power they have undefined right to bring under their allegiance and to protect the small Arab Moslem tribes, &amp;c., in the Arabian peninsula. Sir E. Grey’s despatch of 17th October contained the following passage :— “ I do not propose to enter upon a detailed review of British relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Trucial Chiefs, since the matter is one which in no wise concerns the Ottoman Government; I need simply observe that those relations have been the foundation of the maritime peace which has now been maintained in the Persian Gulf for well-nigh a century. “ Moreover, as Your Excellency is aware, in November and December 1871 the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs himself gave assurances that his Government had no intention of attacking or obtaining any supremacy over Bahrein or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf, and similar assurances had already repeatedly been given to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. “ But, apart altogether from the assurances of the Ottoman Government to which I have referred, Ujair, in the district of El Eatif, is the most southerly point which His Majesty’s Government have ever recognised as being under Turkish influence on the coast of the Persian Gulf. “In these circumstances Your Excellency was instructed to request the Ottoman Government to withdraw the garrison from Zakhnuniyeh on the ground of terminating a disturbance of the status quo; and'your repre sentations were to be based, not only on the title of the Sheikh of Bahrein to the island, but also on the fact that it is situated some distance to the south east of Ujair, the furthest limit of Ottoman jurisdiction.” m. j “ That having achieved second item, we should make treaties on lines of Trucial Coast agreements with Bin Thani, and, if necessary, with other headmen on the west coast of KatrT f The question of making an agreement was first raised by the Govern ment of India in 1902 in connection with the desire of Sheikh Ahmed bin Thani to be taken under our protection, being alarmed at an intimation which he had received from the Turkish authorities that they intended to send more troops to those regions. The Government of India were in favour of the conclusion of an agreement, but in 1903 the idea was shelved because the abandonment by the Turks of the contemplated mudirates above referred to made it impossible for His Majesty’s Government to do anything themselves inconsistent with the status quo. The Government of India, however, m 1904 suggested that without establishing a protectorate it might be justifiable to make such an agreement with the Sheikh as would ^ secure the maintenance of the status quo and the exclusion pf foreign interference, the Sheikh undertaking not to enter into relations with, receive the representative of, or cede territory to any foreign power. (Secret letter No 77 of 31st March 1904), His Majesty s Government had at the time a large number of questions outstanding with the Turkish Govern ment, and Sir N. 0 Conor was unwilling to add to them, being moieo\er c 1 \den 'd whether even the modified proposals of the Government of India cor e squared with the status quo. As a compromise the Government of Ind 4 ^p roposed the revival of an agreement of 1868 made with a former ShejJ 1 hut the Foreign Office (18th February 1905), thought that this would he i’ ; ' ‘tive, and the matter was reserved for consideration by the Defence Corn? 5 ur e along with the whole question of the Persian Gulf. It is not known jether it was so considered, and it has not been heard of since, until Six’ G. Lowther’s Despatch of 22nd August, from w r hich quotation has already been made, and the Foreign Office letter of 4th October, in which the views of the India Office were asked for. We have in the present telegram the views of Lieutenant-Colonel Cox and the Government of India. They are as follows :— (Colonel Cox) “I consider that it would be useless now to mak* treaty with Bin Thani, unless w*' are prepared to do so openly, and to briny about elimination of Turkish influence of Katr, as suggested in second item above. Without such simultaneous action existence of treaty would only be source of danger to the Thani family from the present Turkish regime, and they ivould themselves fight shy of it. (Government of India) :— “ We concur with Cox that no advantage ivould accrue from treaties with Katr Chiefs, and further that Chiefs would probably not now agree to enter into treaties, unless the Turks can be induced to confine themselves to their recognised possessions at Katif and UjairT It will be observed that in 1904, when the local situation was ripe, Constantinople was not ready; and that now, when Constantinople is ready, the local situation is not ripe. Sir G. Lowther in his despatch of 22nd August savs that “ the time may not be far distant when, as advocated by Lord “ Lansdowne in February 1905, a comprehensive, as opposed to piecemeal, “ treatment of outstanding questions in the Persian Gulf . . . may “ become imperative.” The nearest approach that has been made to anything comprehensive was Sir E. Grey’s Despatch of 17th October, the fate of whiefy has been described. If the settlement is to be friendly there must be some give and take. As to this Colonel Cox’s view is : — “ Whether achievement of above ends is possible by means of comprehensive reciprocal compromise, or whether coercive measures will be necessary, is a question beyond my purview, but I beg to say that I can conceive no quid pro quo which we coidd offer Porte in this sphere in exchange for withdrawal of her pretensions. It could perhaps be found in some other sphereT This will presumably be accepted. The only points of contact that we have with Turkey in the neighbourhood of the Gulf are things that both of us want and neither can afford to part with. “ Should coercive measures (Colonel Cox says) be necessary, ice can never expect the recurrence of such a. favourable junction locally as exists at present. The numerical strength of military posts in question has just been reduced to a minimum under Nazim Pasha's scheme for concen trating troops at Bagdad; while we have, strong squadron in the Persian Gulf in connection with Arms Traffic, which would make naval demonstration simple matter.' The Foreign Office, as has been mentioned above, have already contem plated resort to force in the case of the mudirates in Katr, with the result— not uncommon in such cases—that it was proposed that India should perform the task. If troops are to be employed, it is perhaps natural that they should be Indian troops. But their employment would probably come within the scope of 21 &amp; 22 Viet. c. 106, s. 55 : “ Except for preventing or repelling “ actual invasion of Her Majesty’s Indian possessions, or under other sudden “ and urgent necessity, the revenues of India shall not, without the consent “ of both Houses of Parliament, be applicable to defray the expenses of any “ military operation carried on beyond the external frontiers of such “ possessions by Her Majesty’s forces charged upon such revenues.” It isu true that the employment of Indian troops in the naval blockade has not been regarded as covered by the Act. But that can hardly be described as a military operation, whereas the ejection of Turkish garrisons could hardly be described otherwise. That, however, is perhaps a detail, since Parliamentary discussion might be inevitable in any case. As regard? the local situation, Colonel Cox’s views are borne out by recent- reports. The Consul-General at Bagdad has more than once called attention to the military weakness of the Province. In the August Summary (page 14) he noted that after denuding a large part of the country of troops Nazim Pasha had only been able to concentrate some 3,000 men at Bagdad, a number not more than a sufficient garrison for the capital. In order to effect this concentration the forces in Hasa have lately been considerably reduced ; in July 570 men were withdrawn (140 from El Bidaa), and 200 more were to follow. These were not to be replaced, but in cases of emergency troops would be sent from Basra (letter from Political Agent, Bahrein, 24th July 1910, S. 1317/10), the garrison of which the Consul-General, Bagdad, put at one battalion (September Summary, page 5). There remained 70 infantry (to be raised to 100 probably), 40 police, and 6 guns at Katif ; 60 infantry and 4 guns at El Bidaa ; 50 infantry and 2 guns at Ujair; and about 600 infantry, 35 cavalry, 130 police, and 12 guns at Hofuf (the capital of Hasa, 40 miles inland from Ujair). _ ^ It remains to consider the question of a treaty with the Katr Sheikh on its merits. Arguments in favour of it are given on page 4 of Sir R. Ritchie’s memorandum of 30th January 1905. Since that date the case for a treaty has become somewhat stronger. For example, the Katr peninsula is the only part of the coast of the Persian Gulf on which the arms traffic is not pro hibited, and it tends to be a dumping ground in consequence ; thus we heard on 5th December that a dhow under French colours had left Muscat in that direction. If we had a treaty our chain of defences would be complete. Again, with regard to the pearl fisheries, the Law Officers in answering the reference made to them had no doubt as to the rights of the tiibe&amp; in such waters as may justly be considered territorial. Outside these they were inclined to hold that the exclusive rights of the tribes might be maintained to banks in regard to which their exclusive possession is capable of historical proof ; but they considered that the point was not free from doubt. And as regards the deeper waters they were of opinion that there would be no reasonable chance of asserting with success the right of the tribes to debar other nations from dredging. In these circumstances, the Secretary of State agreed with the general conclusion of the Law Officers, viz that it was not expedient to raise the question internationally by iorciblv preventing vessels of foreign nationalties from fishing on the banks. And he added “ The object in view may probably be attainable by indirect methods.”’ (Secret Despatch No. 8, of 31st March 1905.) These indirect methods which would consist mainly in putting difficulties in the way o! interlopers, could probably only be successfully employed if our position vis-a-vis of the tribes were such as would be secured to us by the proposed trGcl^lGS -| -i With regard to the terms of such treaties, it has been suggested that they should follow the lines of the 1892 agreements with the 1 racial Uriels. These provide (1) that the Chiefs will on no account enter into any agreement or correspondence with any power other than the British Governnient; (-) that without the assent of the British Government they will not consent to the residence within their territory of the Agent of any other Government, (3) that they will on no account cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise gne lor occupation, 'any part of their territory, save to the British Government. b CONCLUSIONS. Achievement of above measure!, would completely consolidate our position o ArTcoasi and in Gulf generally, especially regard to pearl ' fisher,i question, and, if it is ever to be brought seems essential that action should be taken now. ,s delayed, the suggested association of Turkey ivith Triple Alliance and increasei 10 of her navy’may render task very difficult, if not impossible. Jn any case, therefore, by one method or another, I. respectfully urge necessity of adjusting position with Turkey forthwith, and eliminating chronic elements of friction which have now become dangerous.' The conclusions to which these considerations seem to point are as follows :— (1.) It is desirable to conclude treaties with the Katr tribes. (2.) It is not possible to do so unless we can guarantee them against Turkish aggression. (3.) There seem to be three ways of arriving at such a guarantee— (а) A comprehensive settlement by friendly agreement. The materials for this do not appear to be forthcoming. (б) A comprehensive settlement by announcement to the Turks that we do not recognise their position at Koweit and south of Ujair, and the translation of that announcement into action by the removal of all signs of Turkish authority. This would obviously be a serious measure, but it might perhaps be taken in reply to some particularly objectionable action on the part of the Turks, either in the Gulf or elsewhere, such as will doubtless be forthcoming before long. (c) A piecemeal settlement. We should make no announcement of policy ; but as each case arises, instead of protesting, remove the objectionable Turks. In the case of Koweit this would also, presumably, mean that we should support the Sheikh b}^ force in the question of the registration of his Turkish properties, i.e., guarantee him against the conse quences of forcibly ejecting any persons whom the Turks might send to take possession of those properties. (4.) When the Turkish difficulty has been finally removed by one or other of these means, the main reason for concluding the agreements will have disappeared. It is for the Foreign Office to decide. 7th December 1910. F. A. H. o *7 | 'ii w CONFIDENTIAL. NOVI 910 Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 15, 5 p.m.) (No. 249.)

September 1910. Sir G. Lowther, Memorandum by Mr. E. Parkes respecting No. 861, December is, 1908 the appointment of a Turkish Mudir at [44443]. IVakra, and the question of a Treaty with El Katr. WAKE A is a coast town between Odeid and El Bidaa in the El Katr Peninsula. Confidential Print, The British Government have refused to recognise Turkish authority in El Katr, although they have acquiesced in the continued presence of a Turkish post since 1S72 at El Bidaa. In 1895 a settlement of malcontents, who had established themselves under the Turkish flag at Z ohara, on the El Katr coast, was forcibly dispersed by Her Majesty’s Government. The Turks protested, but Her Majesty’s Government stated in reply that “ they did not recognise Turkish jurisdiction on the El Katr coast.” Sir N. O’Conor, In December 1902 our Ambassador at Con- December 3 10CO s^ntinople forwarded an extract from the Turkish semi-official paper, the c ‘ Ikdam,” respecting the proposed appointment of Turkish administrative posts (Mudirates) at Wakra, Odeid, Zobara, and Amair or Abu Ali Island, or Musalamiya Island, on the El Katr coast. India Office, The matter was referred to the India Office, February 4,1903. w j 10 were 0 f opinion that the Porte should be informed again that His Majesty’s Government did not recognise the Turkish claim to sovereignty over the El Katr Peninsula, and should be pressed to maintain the status quo in that region. The Indian Government, in order to prevent Turkish designs, were strongly in favour of concluding with Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani, de facto Chief of El Katr and heir of Sheikh Jasim (who was then over 80 years of age), an Agree ment on the lines of those existing with Bahrein and the Trucial Chiefs. Sir N. O’Conor, This view was communicated to Constanti- March 14 &gt; nople, but Sir N. O’Conor considered it advisable to avoid directly raising the question of Turkish sovereignty, and proposed to dissuade the Porte [748]Jr- from tlieir intended action, on the ground that it would be highly impolitic to disturb the status quo. In reply to his representations the Porte denied that there was any intention to send Mudirs to El Katr, and gave an assurance that they would not do so. This assurance was subsequently repeated, and Tewfik Pasha was given to understand by Sir N. O’Conor that the Mudirs would be turned out if they went to Zobara or Odeid. In the meantime information was received from India that the Mudirs of Zobara and Odeid had been appointed, and were on the w r ay to their posts. A British skip of war was accordingly sent to those places to prevent their landing. Further representations were made by Sir N. O’Conor, and he was then able to report that the Porte had sent orders to the Governor of El Hasa cancelling the appointment of Mudirs on the El Katr coast. The assurances given by the Porte were formally recorded and acknowledged in a note addressed to Musurus Pasha, the Turkish Ambassador here, on the 30th April, 1903. In spite of the Turkish assurances, Yusuf Ali, the Mudir-designate of Wakra, arrived at Bahrein en route for his post. Sir N. O’Conor was at once instructed to press for his recall, and steps were taken by the British authorities to detain him. He succeeded, however, in Sir N. OPonor, No. 146, March 23, 1903. Sir N.

O’Conor, but the luikish Government assured him that they had no knowledge of the appointment and that Y usuf Bey would be recalled. In reporting the Turkish assurance Sir K. O Conor stated that, if the Resident at Bushire considered it advisable, he saw no objection to Yusuf’s forcible removal under pressure exercised by a British war-ship. It was, however, subsequently reported that the officials designated as Mudirs at Zobara and Odeid had been provided for elsewhere, and had gone to other posts. As for Y r usuf, he had been removed from Wakra and was in residence at After Yusuf’s departure SirK O’Conor informed the Resident at Bushire that Abdul Rahman- Sir N. O’Conor. No. 261, May 12, 1903.and enquired if there was any objection to the appointment. Colonel Kemball considered that the appointment by the Turks of an administra tive official should he objected to, and that a British ship of war should visit Wakra to observe the situation. Sir N. O’Conor, Sir N. O’Conor accordingly made representa- September 8,1903. tions to the Porte, and was informed that instructions had been sent to the Yali of Bussorah to deprive Sheikh Abdul Bahman of Sir N. O’Conor, his character of Mudir of Wakra. The Yali subsequently informed the Acting Consul at Bussorah that he had instructed the Mutessarif No. 598, September 28, 1903. India Office, November 11, 1903. of El Hasa to revert to the status quo and to suppress the Mudirate. In September 1903, Mr. Gaskin, the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, proceeded to El Katr to interview Sheikh Jasim on the Wakra situa tion. He was informed that the Sheikh had, in 1898, abdicated in favour of his brother, Ahmed- bin-Thani, who was therefore in effect Sheikh of El Katr, and accepted as such by the people and the Turks. Mr. Gaskin afterwards had an inter view with Sheikh Ahmed, who stated that Abdul llahman (son of Sheikh Jasim) had been posted Sheikh of Wakra in 1898, and nominated in July 1903, by the Mutessarif of El-Hasa, as Mudir of Wakra, in place of Yusuf Bey, at a salary of £ T. 0 a-month. Sir X. O’Conor, Considerable delay occurred in the execution foo/ 35 ’ ^ ^ le ^ &gt;01 ^ e s f° suppress the Wakra Mudirate. Representations by Sir N. O’Conor on the subject were met by the Forte’s assurance that Sheikh Abdul Rahman was merely the head of his tribe, and did not hold the position or title of Mudir. India Office, The India Office, when consulted as to the May 18,1904. formal cancellation of Sheikh Abdul Rahman’s appointment as Mudir, held that the delay which had occurred would justify the conclusion of an agreement with Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani similar to those concluded with the Chiefs of the southern littoral. This view, however, did not meet with Sir N. O’Conor, No. 516, June 28, 1904. Mr. Townley, No. 863, November 8, 1904. the approval of Sir N. O’Conor, who pointed out that instructions had been given to the Yali of Bussorah to annul the appointment, and that they would ultimately be carried out. In October 1901 the Acting Consul at Bussorah, reported to Constantinople that, according to the Acting Yali, Sheikh Abdul Rahman had been finally and definitely deprived of the position of4 ^WpifW!fpiW^ ?l * |ai ' 1 ' Mudir of Wakra, but that be would continue to receive payment of the yearly salary or subsidy which he had for many years received from the Turkish Government as Sheikh of a tribe which is sometimes in the neighbourhood of Wakra. The Wakra question was thus settled; but the India Office, Indian Government made further proposals for 1 ^™ anc i the conclusion of a Protectorate Treaty with January 28, 190u. Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani of El Khtr. They recommended that an Agreement should be made with Sheikh Ahmed on the lines of that 4 r /L concluded in 1868 with Sheikh Mahomed-bin- Sanee. This Agreement of 1868 had not been renewed in 1882 when, after the death of Sheikh Mahomed, a request for its continuance, received from his son, Sheikh Jasim, was refused by the Government of India on the ground that Sheikh Jasim’s relations with the Turks were such as to render an Agreement with him inexpedient. Lord Lansdowne, however, was unwilling to sanction any new departure in regard to El Katr without further consideration, and suggested that the matter should be deferred until the whole question of the policy to be pursued in the Persian Gulf had been fully examined. Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani, it may be men tioned incidentally, was murdered towards the To India Office, February 18,1905.COPY.

(Signed) E.Pisani. H.Rumbold, Esq.[A] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. [October 17.] - CONFIDENTIAL. Section 4. [32854] No. 1. (No. 312.) Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Lowther. Sir, Foreign Office, October 17, 1910. I HAVE received your Excellency’s despatch No. 603 of the 22nd August and other reports, in which you enumerate repeated instances of the arbitrary and vexatious treatment of British subjects in Asiatic Turkey, and, further, draw my attention to the number of incidents of political aggression, all tending to a disturbance of the status quo, which have recently marked the conduct of the Ottoman authorities in the region of the Persian Gulf. It will be convenient to deal first with the injustice to which British commercial interests have been subjected. In July the representative of Messrs. Lynch and Co. at Bagdad was informed that certain property of his firm would, under a municipal regulation, be demolished as insecure and dangerous. The British Consul-General found that the property, which he took an early opportunity of inspecting, was perfectly safe. A few days later a notification was made to Messrs. Abdul Ali, a British-Indian firm, respecting the projected demolition, on similar grounds, of their principal shop and the arbitrary expropriation of the site, which is a valuable one. This property was likewise found, on inspection, to be in excellent condition and in no wise dangerous. The British Consul-General hereupon visited the President of the Municipality and protested vigorously against the wanton destruction of property on a false pretext of danger to the public. The conclusion drawn by His Majesty’s Consul-General was that, in the absence of funds to meet the cost of legal expropriation, the procedure complained of had been adopted. Notwithstanding that your Excellency had in the meantime made urgent representations through the Minister of the Interior, an extensive demolition of Messrs. Lynch’s property, including their chief office, was begun on the 7th August, and more recently His Majesty’s Consul-General has reported that the property of British subjects already demolished and threatened means a loss of some £ T. 5,000; while he learns that it is proposed to enforce further expropriations, at great loss to many British subjects resident in Bagdad. On the 29th September your Excellency reported that British-Indian property at Kazimia and Kerbela had likewise been demolished, and that the Vali had declined any indemnification on grounds which are wholly unconvincing. His Majesty’s Government must emphatically protest against this procedure ; they must further, in view of the fact that it has originated with the Vali, hold the Ottoman Government themselves responsible for the damage already inflicted, and, after receiving a report as to its precise extent from His Majesty’s Consul-General, your Excellency should present a detailed claim to the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs. Before leaving the question of these expropriations, I think it necessary to advert to the rumoured intention of the Vali of Bagdad to cause a new road to be constructed through the middle of the grounds of His Majesty’s Consulate-General, whereas by making a slight deviation it might be made to follow an existing road : it is true that after your Excellency had made representations to the Sublime Porte, the Vali asserted to His Majesty’s Consul-General that no interference with the Consulate buildings had been in contemplation: I feel constrained to observe that the local evidence to the contrary effect is of a conclusive character. Two further cases of unwarrantable interference with British interests have also recently occurred at Bagdad :— In the first of these cases Messrs. Abdul Ali, the British-Indian firm already referred to, were suddenly ordered to sell the ice manufactured by them at a reduced rate of 10 paras a kilogramme instead of 20 paras an oke, their usual charge: I understand that owing to non-compliance with this arbitrary order the local authorities have threatened to close by force two ice factories belonging to British Indian subjects. [2930 r —-4]V -— In the second case two British firms, Messrs. Blockey Cree and Co. and Messrs. Blanev and Solomon, were informed that they mnst transfer their factories to the outskirts of the town, on the pretext of a regulation 46 years old concerning steam- engines and boilers, whereas, as your Excellency has pointed out to me, the lactones m question are run by smokeless oil-engines, which are in ^ no respect dangerous.^ There is clearly, therefore, no ground whatever for the application of the regulation to these factories, and its enforcement would be wholly unreasonable and very burdensome to the owners. Your Excellency should insist upon satisfaction being accorded to all these British subjects and afford to them the full and effectual protection of His Majesty s Government, who cannot admit a continuance of the oppression to which they aie being subjected. You should add that His Majesty’s Government cannot be expected to acquiesce in the helplessness expressed by the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs with regard to the illegal proceedings of the Bagdad authorities, and that such helplessness on the part of the central authorities amounts to an abdication of Government. I have already furnished your Excellency with full instructions on the subject of the forcible and unjust intervention of the Ministry of Public Works in the dispute which has arisen between the Smyrna— Aidin Railway Company and the Societe des Qnais: it is matter for grave concern to His Majesty’s Government that, apart from this particular incident, the Board of this Company should be compelled to complain that “ for the past two years the attitude of the Ministry of Commerce and Public Works has been increasingly overbearing and harassing,” and that they should have claimed the active protection of His Majesty s Government not only on account of the important material interests involved in the present case, but also m view of the s 3 T stematic and continuous attempts which are now being made to encroach on the Company’s rights and ? privileges as laid down in its Conventions with the Imperial Ottoman Government.’ I pass now to the incidents of political aggression. On the 30th May, 1909, I informed your Excellency that the lurks had some time previously occupied the island of Zakhnuniyeh, which lies some 10 miles south-east o TJjair; that they had hoisted the Turkish flag on a fort, and had arranged to keep a guard there ; that the Sheikh of Bahrein had protested to His Majesty s Government against this occupation, his father having built the fort, where he used to keep a garrison, fifty years ago ; and that the island, which had no permanent inhabitants, had been regularly visited for purposes of fishing, by natives of Bahrein. I do not propose to enter upon a detailed review of British relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein amd the Trucial Chiefs, since the matter is one which in no wise concerns the Ottoman Government: I need simply observe that those relations have been the foundation of the maritime peace which has now been maintained in the Persian Gulf for well-nigh a century. Moreover, as your Excellency is aware, m November and December lo71 the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs himself gave assurances that his Government had no intention of attacking or obtaining any supremacy over Bahrein or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf, and similar assurances had already repeatedly been given to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. But apart altogether from the assurances of the Ottoman Government to which •I have referred, Ujair, in the district of El Katif, is the most southerly point which His Majesty’s Government have ever recognised as being under Turkish influence on the coast of the Persian Gulf. In these circumstances your Excellency was instructed to request the Ottoman Government to withdraw the garrison from Zakhnuniyeh on the ground of terminating a disturbance of the status quo ; and your representations were to be based not only on the title of the Sheikh of Bahrein to the island, but also on the fact that it is situated some distance to the south-east of ITjair, the furthest limit of Ottoman jurisdiction. Although the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs informed your Excellency that ^ the garrison had been withdrawn in June 1909, it has since been reinstated in the island, and, according to the latest reports, has quite recently been reinforced : and the Ottoman authorities in regard to this question seem set upon disregarding your Excellency’s repeated representations on the subject. I have accordingly to instruct your Excellency to request that orders may be issued for the immediate and permanent withdrawal of the garrison. The next point upon which I desire to address your Excellency is the treatment --til se en an the lad ent idy ilcli deli )nce man ling only it is jinan that a the and youi iy 1)6 tment to which the Sheikh of Koweit has been subjected by Suleiman Nazif Bey, the late Vali of Bussorah, with regard to the property which he purchased, in the' course of last year, from Ahmed Pasha-el-Zoheir at a price of £ T. 48,000 which was duly paid down. When, however, Sheikh Mubarek took steps to register the transfer at the ^Turkish Land Office he was informed that he must register himself as a Turkish subject : such a demand in reference to a transfer of land had never before been made. Your Excellency should inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Government regard the conduct of the late Yali in this matter as an attempt to modify the status quo with regard to Koweit, which is the basis of the understanding between His Majesty’s Government and the Ottoman Government in this important question. It appears, moreover, from reliable and circumstantial reports, that the late Vali tried by tortuous methods to instigate the vendor of the Fedaghia property to impugn Sheikh Mubarek’s title. The vendor remonstrated with the Yali, pointing out the absurdity of repudiating the sale in the face of the title-deeds held by the Sheikh, which, besides the signature of the vendor, bore those of all the Bussorah notables as well as that of the British consul. His Majesty’s Government rely upon the Ottoman Government to bring about a satisfactory settlement of the registration of this property; they have no wish to raise difficulties with regard to the past conduct of an official who has since been recalled ; but I must add that the incident is vexatious, and serves to deepen the impression entertained by His Majesty’s Government of ill-will on the part of the Turkish officials. In his recent dealings with the Sheikh of Mohammerah the conduct of the late Vali of Bussorah has been in the highest degree violent, vindictive, and unjust. It is known to His Majesty’s Government from reports received from His Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah that there were no disturbances of importance on the Shat-el-Arab during last winter, that the Sheikh recently exercised his good offices in the endeavour to promote a reconciliation between the Vali and an important Arab chief of Turkish nationality, and that the Sheikh has, in fact, carried his conciliatory attitude towards Nazif Bey so far as to acquiesce without complaint in the destruction of houses belonging to him at Bussorah. It is further known through His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah that Sheikh Khazal has endeavoured to promote friendly relations between Nazif Bey and the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh. Such was the situation at the end of March last when the Sheikh and the Vali appeared still to be on the best of terms. Shortly afterwards, however, the Vali brought against the Sheikh certain accusations into the nature of which it is unnecessary to enter in detail, since your Excellency is already familiar with it from the correspondence which has passed on the subject. No serious proof of the truth of these accusations was ever offered, nor was any opportunity ever given to the Sheikh to disprove the charges brought against him, which he was perfectly able and willing to do. On the contrary, the Vali totally ignored a friendly and conciliatory letter addressed to him by the Sheikh, expressing the intention of proceeding to Bussorah to discuss the matters in dispute, and, further, on the Sheikh’s arrival there on the 18th April, most unjustifiably and discourteously refused to receive him at all. The Sheikh had no alternative but to return to Mohammerah. ' On the 24th April the Vali issued circular instructions to the local officials under his jurisdiction summarily to remove all headmen dependent on the Sheikh, and on the 25th April, during the latter’s absence at Ahwaz, the Turkish gun-boat “ Marmaris,” acting on the orders of Nazif Bey, shelled the village of Zain belonging to the Sheikh, which was afterwards looted and destroyed by Turkish soldiers. In the course of this attack the house of the Sheikh’s mother was burnt, and one of his wives died from shock caused by the bombardment. On the 26th April the Vali, in two official letters addressed to the Persian Consul at Bussorah, went so far as to threaten action against Mohammerah itself in the event of failure to comply with his demands. In spite of the injury and provocation which he had received, Sheikh Khazal continued to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government by maintaining a conciliatory attitude, by restraining his agents and supporters from any aggressive action, and by adopting their suggestions with respect to the wording of his communications with the Vali. The latter, on the contrary, displayed strong resentment at the attempts made by His Majesty s Consul at Bussorah, under instructions from His Majesty’s Government, to promote an understanding between him and the Sheikh. -il4 -— &gt;»— ■ &lt; ,mm Nazif Bey, it is true, finally accepted Sheikh Khazal’s explanations and agreed to consider the incident closed, but he unconditionally refused to express regret for the death of the Sheikh’s wife and the destruction of his mother’s house, or to pay any compensation for the losses suffered by the Sheikh in consequence of the unjustifiable bombardment of Zain. Further, at the very moment when he wa^T considering the Sheikh’s explanations with which he owned himself satisfied, his agents were occupied in subjecting the Sheikh to further petty annoyances in the matter of the renewal, contrary to the \ all’s promise, of the lawsuit against the servant of Mirza Hamza, the Sheikh’s agent at Bussorah, of the unjustified destruction, for the third time since the dispute between the Sheikh and the Vali began, of the former’s house property on the Ashar Creek and of the raid on Mirza Hamza’s house and the seizure of his property, on the ground that he had disregarded a summons for debt which had been issued against him. There can be little doubt that Nazif Bey was the real instigator of these vexatious proceedings. A further injustice to the Sheikh has now been committed by the decree recently issued by the Sublime Porte forbidding the registratioD of land in the vilayet of Bussorah in the name of the Sheikh or his representatives, a measure which appears to be actually contrary to Ottoman law. Your Excellency should bring these facts to the notice of the Turkish Government, and inform them that His Majesty’s Government are bound, by agreement with the Sheikh, to use their good offices on his behalf in the event of a dispute with a foreign Power, that they have most carefully considered the circumstances of his recent dispute with the Vali of Bussorah, and can see no justification whatever for the harsh and aggressive action of the latter, especially in the matter of the attack^ on Zain, nor for the recent decree of the Porte regarding the registration of land in the vilayet of Bussorah. You should add that, in view of their obligations towards the Sheikh, they cannot allow the status quo on the Shat-el-Arab to be altered to his detriment, and you should express the hope that a satisfactory arrangement will be arrived at with the Sheikh, who has displayed anxiety to live on good terms with his neighbours, and has shown, throughout recent events, great self-restraint and patience, in marked contrast—as His Majesty’s Government observe with regret—with the attitude of the Turkish authorities. These occurrences, which individually have been the cause of painful surprise to His Majesty’s Government, have produced, in their cumulative effect, an unfavourable impression as to the present attitude of the local Ottoman authorities, an attitude which appears to be one of hostility and aggression. His Majesty’s Government cannot believe that this attitude has the approval of the Central Government, or is based upon their specific instructions. I therefore have decided to instruct you to communicate a translation of this despatch to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in order that his Excellency may be fully apprised of the views of His Majesty’s Government and of their causes of complaint: in taking this step your Excellency' should explain that His Majesty’s Government have decided to make friendly representations, believing that the Ottoman Government will redress the grievances referred to, for a situation of very considerable gravity would of course arise if they proved to be the result of deliberate and unfriendly policy.

Lov:ther to Sir Ediuard Grey. — (Received'August 29.) (No. 603.) . , gj r Therapia, August 22, 1910. ON the 5th July I received a telegram from His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah to the effect that, according to information from the resident at Bushire, Turkish soldiers had amain returned to the island of Zakhnuniyeh and that the Turkish flag was hoisted there on Fridays, and later received the despatch from Mr. Crow, copy of which is enclosed herewith. • . I immediately brought the matter to the notice of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and renewed mv representations of the spring of last year on the lines of the instructions conveyed in your telegram of the 30th May, 1909, pointing out that the island is situated some 10 miles to the south-east of Ojair, the point recognised by His Majesty’s Government as the furthest limit of Ottoman jurisdiction m El klassa, and that this violation of the status quo would only needlessly create a fresh incident. is Excellency promised to study the question and let me know the result later on, but from the evasive nature of his replies to my repeated representations of last summer I have some doubt about obtaining a definite settlement as desired by His v ajes y s Government, and suspect that the withdrawal of the military post, reporteu by me on the 27th September, 1909, was merely owing to the termination ol the_ fishing season, during which the Turks pretended the presence of their gendarmes to be necessary to maintain order among the Dowasir fishermen from Bahrein who frequent the is and In a report received by the Porte from the Mutessanf of El Hassa the latter, after giving the dimensions, &amp;c., of Zakhnuniyeh, maintained that it was practically part o fhe mainland, thus revealing the pretensions of the Turks not only to the island but to 1116 T. 4 Cri'TnAfs telegram of the 6th August, 1910, reported that the Vali of Bussorah has now appointed a mudir, or sub-governor, at Odeid. All this seems to point to a determination to assert and extend Ottoman sovereignty in the neighbour hood of El Katr and it seems to me only prudent that His Majesty s Government should make up its mind as to the attitude to be adopted towards loung Tin . } general forwafd policy in the regions of the Gulf. Under the old regime we femporised, but it seems that now a more definite and direct attitude may become expedient, if not necessary. The vigorous action of the , b® ' shlwecf a deter® with the Sheikh of Mohammerah and m the bombardment of Zein showed a deter m , atten to assert Turkish sovereign rights ; while Mr. Lonmer, m his telegram of the 16th Aucnist records his conviction that the high-handed methods employed by the authorities of Bagdad in the matter of the demolition of Messrs. Lynch s premises and the threatened encroachments on the residency were intended to demonstiate t at foreiffn subiects and interests are at their mercy. This policy, if not checked, may be fiZded to ?he sepoy guard of the residency and to the “ Comet ” the presence of both of which is highly distasteful to Turkish national sentiment, whilst it is not impossi e we mav eventually find a boycott, as in the case of the Greeks and Austrians started against Lynch’sfiteamers with the object of driving this foreign company w th its foreiln flag off Turkish internal waters. The old regime was economically old- fashioned and negative as regards the assertion of its sovereign rig 1 s - ,,,,1 ^Ster the change in July° 1908, and while the Cabinet was composed of the Elder committeemen t°pk mj P a U m machinery of Government, the them, and when m 1909 the com a.,,,,,-,,,oritnrs were put in the background, Elder Liberal statesmen and pro-Bntis f ■ thouoh the present rulers and their voices and sentiments silenced by the 'C^sed of younger have to reckon with them to a certain extent Jte ™ttee co p men is more modern and businesslike, while it is also more pu-n b [ 2853 /— 1 ]2 as regards tlie vindication of its “national” rights. It is not swayed by sentiment, but bas adopted the doctrine of “ Real-Politik,” and not unnaturally believes that Young Turkey has to play a prominent, if not the principal, part in the Asiatic revival, and work in sympathy with cognate forces in Persia, Egypt, and India. In its internal form the committee appears to be a Judseo-Turkish dual alliance, the Turks supplying a splendid military material and the Jews the brain, enterprise, money (e.g., Djavid Bey’s recent loan in Paris),fand a strong press influence in Europe; while, as shown by Sionist literature since the revolution, the J ewish world seems to have now turned its eyes towards Mesopotamia as the land best suited to Jewish colonisation and the ultimate formation of a Jewish autonomous State. The Jews, who now seem to inspire and control the inside machinery of the State, and are bent on the economic and industrial capture of Young Turkey, appear determined that no important enterprise shall be started in Mesopotamia without their participation, if not control, and it is perhaps significant that the attacks on Sir William Willcocks have been led by a Jew in a Jewish organ here, and the opposition to the Lynch scheme in Turkish circles w r as mainly the work of Sassoon Effendi, the Jewish deputy for Bagdad. The Jews, in order to maintain their position of influence in Toung Turkey circles, have to play up to, if not encourage, Turkish “nationalist” tendencies, and the two elements make a distinctly strong combination which has to be reckoned with, especially by those interested in Mesopotamia. It must, moreover, not be forgotten that the present form of constitutionalism in Turkey is not one w*hich the masses have risen up and demanded, but is rather a form which a freethinking oligarchy have imposed on the masses at the point of the bayonet. This minority, wdio are also in a sense anti-clerical, have felt the necessity of replacing the old theocratic conception of the deeply religious Mussulman by a new r Pan-Islamic and Pan-Asiatic creed. Again the purely Turkish element, inspired by its past traditions of conquest and its martial superiority, naturally arrogates to itself the role of protector of other Asiatic and Islamic peoples. The result is a strong anti-Russian current, as, in their phraseology, Russia “ has usurped and oppresses” Asiatic Mussulmans, and a similar, if less strong anti-British current, owing to our position in India, Aden, Egypt, the Persian Gulf, and especially owing to the Anglo-Russian entente regarding Persia and Afghanistan. Thus the natural corollary of this perfervid Asiatic-cum-Islamic sentiment is a community of interest between Russia and England, more particularly in Persia, while France, owing to her position in Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco also, though in a lesser degree, comes in for a share of Young Turkey’s resentment, Had Turkey’s “ constitutionalism ” been an approximation to real liberal and popular institutions, allowing a certain amount of free play to the different elements, she would, like Austria, have formed internally a natural equipoise of races, and would have felt no necessity to adopt a chauvinistic attitude in her foreign politics—an attitude which is, so to speak, potentially aggressive. The Turkish masses put up with thirty odd years of the despotism of Yildiz, and especially the severer form which obtained during the second half, he., since the Armenian massacres, practically without a murmur, and there is no reason why they should not similarly endure for a considerable period the more go-a-head despotism of the committee. But should the position of the latter be shaken owing to an explosion of internal disaffection or external shock, or a combination of both, we should almost certainly see a repetition of the pro-British demonstrations of 1908, somewhat embar rassing as they were. Y e must, however, take facts as they are, and, as far as Mesopotamia is concerned, Toung Turkey’s policy is to spare neither energy nor money to create a strong military force in those regions, to disarm the refractory tribes and bring them under effective control, and, in a word, to impress the Arabs and show them that the Turk is master against all comers, native or foreign. It must, too, be remembered that the present military Governor-General of Bagdad’s semi-viceregal powers run from Hekkiari in the north to Mohammerah and to El Katr in the Arabian peninsula, and the Turks have a natural desire and pretension to pose as the protectors of the weaker Asiatic Mussulman state in Persia. The committee has been compared to a steam-roller, which, in a semi-republican manner, is determined to level all privileges, starting with those of the palace. It has done so in Albania and Roumelia, and is now busy in Syria. It also, somewhat logically, feels a desire to apply the same levelling process to the privileged or predominant position of foreigners, e.g., of the British in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. Had they proceeded slowly and gradually their policy would have been more successful and encountered less objection and resistance. But what appears to natives and foreigners as undue haste and abruptness of method seems to be the prevailing characteristics ofthe new regime, and the recent action of the authorities at Bagdad in the matter of the arbitrary demolition of Lynch’s premises and their intention of unnecessarily running a road through the grounds of His Majesty’s consulate-general are only instances in point. One cannot help sympathising with the desire of a regained consciousness of national independence to assert itself, but the present mental attitude of the Young Turks is rather destructive and devoid of a feeling of give and take. Given this frame of mind it would seem only prudent of us not to remind them either in the public press or privately of our commercial or political predominance in Irak or the Gulf, as such assertions only nerve them to further attempts to diminish our prestige and undermine our predominance. The external manifestations of our special position in those regions which wound their susceptibilities are, apart from the general situation in the adjoining districts of South Persia, the size of our residency buildings and grounds at Bagdad, the sepoy guard, the R.I.M.S. “ Comet,” the British flag flown by two of Lynch’s steamers on Turkey’s internal waters, the status of the Sheikh of Ivoweit, and^ his influence and position as regards the Mumtefik, Ibn Saoud, &amp;c., Bahrein, and El Katr, if not, indeed, the Trucial Coast and Muscat. _ . The sepoy guard and the u Comet,” which are the survival of a state of things which is passing away in proportion as Bagdad becomes^ accessible to^tbe outside world, are in a wny incompatible with an effective assertion of turkeys territorial sovereignty, and give a certain legitimate ground for umbrage to the Turkish authorities ; but until the new regime is able to stand alone without the prop of martial law in the capital, if not, indeed, until the time comes to do away with the Capitula tions, it would seem premature to consider any suggestion towards abolishing them, except, perhaps, as part of a general bargain or liquidation of our position vis-a-vis of Turkey in the upper reaches of the Persian Gulf. - 4 ? After the revival of the constitution an attempt was made to settle tho question ox the British flag on Lynch’s steamers by fusing the latter with the Mehrieh Ottoman Company, and, had Kiamil Pasha or Hilmi Pasha retained power, the scheme would doubtless have been sanctioned; but, as will be remembered, a section of the committee took up an uncompromising attitude, the project fell through, and it only remains or the present to endeavour to protect Lynch’s acquired rights, but the possibility o± friction ending in an anti-Lynch boycott cannot be excluded. . As regards Koweit and Sheikh Mubarek’s sphere of _ influence, His Majesty s Government in 1902 contended that he had always been independent, and that his father had specially stipulated such independence when he allowed B'^sh Moops to cross liis territory during Midhat Pasha’s expeditions to El Hasa (called Nejd by the Turks) The Turks maintained that Koweit was an integral portion of the Ottoman Empire and pointed to the Turkish flag flown there, and the grade of pasha accepted bv the sheikh. To this latter argument my predecessor replied that these were mere y emblems of the sheikh’s spiritual dependence on the Caliph, and the status quo basis was agreed to, but the Turks interpreted it as meaning that Koweit was an Integra part of their territory. In their mind England’s interference there was^ due to our rivalrv with Germany over the terminal section of and point of the Bagdad Rai vwy, and they expect to get the question settled favourably to their contention when final arrangements are made for the completion of that enterprise. As regards Zakhnuniyeh, El Katr, and Bahrein which m a way form one group, the active forward policy of the Young Turk Yali of Bussorah and the Mutessarif of FI Hasa (Nejd) have already brought us into sharp conflict, and there seems no doub tharwe sS insist on Turkish exclusion from the district south of Omir If the Minister for Foreign Affairs, after studying the question of Zakhnuniyeh and Odied an consulting his colleagues, does not give categorical instructions for the non-mter eren ofX Turkish local authorities, it would seem necessary, subject to the views o£ His Matsty’s Government, to take a strong line. For, to the Turkish mind Zakhnuniyeh onnexed Gwadur, in South Baluchistan, and sailed up the Gulf, compe l ^ &lt; SSrt S»o,;iri f tie sovoreigiity o£ k ,,eo»J dttim i. Of eomse » kWpM g** and is a strange derogation from the much-vaunted principle of Ottomamsm,A opposed to Islamism, supposed to be the keystone of the new regime. The first claim is barred by the absence of effective occupation for close on three centuries, and^ is consequently inadmissible, as shown by the arrangements^ with Germany by which His Majesty’s Government acknowledged the latter s rights in the Cameroons, bouth- 'West Africa &amp;c. Should ’ the present Turkish Government prove obdurate in the matters of Zakhnuniyeh and the Mudir of Odeid, it would be well, I think, to remember that in applying the methods of coercion, employed under the old regime, it was a question of bringing pressure to bear on a Sultan who did not allow such incidents to be discussed ?n the native press; whereas the present rulers, who owing to youthful inexperience have perhaps less sense of caution and responsibility, nia}q through the native press—which is not allowed to criticise their acts—rouse public opinion by appeals to the fanaticism and ultra-national feelings of the ignorant masses, and by depicting England as aggressively hostile to Islam. I do not, however, think that we should be deterred by such methods. Young Turkey is now on fairly friendly terms with Austria, despite the amputation of Bosnia and Herzegovina,_ while, though the Russian Embassy have been extremely complacent and apparently in relations of most intimate friendship with the leading members of the committee, the at ter s organs have not refrained from fierce attacks on Russia and her policy. Again, during the last nine months the blandishments showered by the French Embassy and Government on the Young Turks have not deterred them fiom taking up a line of sharp antagonism to French semi-official finance in the matter of a recent loan, and courting the displeasure of French Government circles by rather violent criticisms in the Tamn ” &amp;c. On p. 22 of the Confidential memorandum of February 1908, respecting British interests in the Persian Gulf, the Trucial Coast is said to extend to El Odeid, and the Abu Dthabi are reckoned among the Trucial chiefs, while on p.^ 42 Colonel Belly is quoted as having in 1872 regarded El Odeid as properly belonging to Aber Dthabi. In 1904, after the appointment by the Turks of a mudir at Wakra had been cancelled, the Government of India expressed forcibly their view that a treaty should be negotiated with Sheikh Ahmed, but this course was deprecated by my predecessor, Sir N. R. O’Conor, who regarded the conclusion of the proposed treaty as then inopportune. Should His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India now decide on the expediency of making such a treaty, there would seem to me no objection from the Constantinople point of view, and the time may not be far distant when, as advocated by Lord Lansdowne in February 1905, a comprehensive, as opposed to piecemeal, treatment of outstanding questions in the Persian Gulf, including the withdrawal, absolute or against some quid pro quo, of the Turkish post at El Bidaia, may become imperative, if, indeed, it is not forced upon us. In their despatch of the 21st February, 1907, the Government of India expressed the view that the chances of Turkey re-establishing her authority in Eastern Arabia to be remote, and even contemplated the prospect of the Turks disappearing altogether from the whole of Arabia south of Zobehr. The revival of the Turkish constitution in 1908 and the events of the last two years have considerably, if not profoundly, modified the situation in the near East. The Turkish revolution was not merely a change of regime and reign, as it appeared to some, but meant the awakening of nevr and powerful forces on the lines of an Asiatic or Turkish revival. In 1903 our position in the Gulf seemed threatened by Russia, and Lord Lansdowne’s declaration in the House of Lords had in view the possible aggressive expansion of other Powers than Turkey ; but the latter is now bent on an active and forward policy there, and after the recent acquisition of money in Paris and additions to her fleet from Germany, we may soon see one or more Turkish naval units cruising in the Gulf. A ship flying the Turkish flag will certainly produce a greater effect on the Arabs than did the “ Variag,” while the meddlesome tactlessness of Turkish naval officers and their desire to have coaling stations, &amp;c., may give rise to troublesome incidents. I was recently confidentially informed of the drift of a report on the Persian Gulf and England’s position there compiled by Mahmoud Bey, the Ottoman consul-general at Bombay, and his subordinate Jelal Bey, both of whom seem to be keen and active officials. The report sketches the way in which Great Britain has built up her influence by generous pecuniary treatment of the Arab chiefs at Muscat and elsewhere, and urges that the Ottoman Government should employ similar methods, which, it says, ought to be more successful than those of England, owing to the Islamic tie between the Arabs and the Turks-. Some remarks in this despatch may sound like severe criticism of the policy of the present riders of Turkey, and I may perhaps point out that my official and privaterelations with those in power are quite cordial, while their professions of friendship for Great Britain are frequent and, I have no doubt, genuine ; but I feel that this should not blind us to the main trend of Young Turkey aspirations, and to the likelihood that the prosecution of their national programme will bring British and Ottoman real or fancied interests into conflict in several parts of the Arab world, and perhaps, especially, in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. Hussein Jahid Bey, deputy for Constantinople, the “ fidus Achates ” of Djavid Bey, the Minister of Finance, and the spokesman of the committee in the “Tanin,” has recently told us in a couple of signed articles that Young Turkey must strain every nerve to increase her land and naval forces, and that when the Minister of War can dispose of 1,500,000 bayonets, and the Minister of Marine of a considerable naval force, Turkey’s Minister for Foreign Affairs will be considered as one of the greatest of European statesmen, and Turkey will then “wreak vengeance on those who do not now treat her with proper regard. Some officers in high positions have been heard indulging in similar outbursts, and an aide-de-camp of the Minister of War recently declared to an Englishman here that Turkey would, if put to it, light the Islamic torch from Calcutta to Morocco. _ These and other such expressions of a crescentade spirit need not be taken too literally, but they cannot be entirely ignored, as they are indicative of strong undercurrents. In this connection, I have the honour to enclose copies of three articles vdiich have recently appeared in the “ Jeune Turc,” a committee-inspired paper, which, like the “ Neue Freie Presse ” of Vienna, is financed and directed by Jews. The latter’s detes tation of Russia, which is one of the features of Young Turkey, is frequently reflected in its columns, and in one of the enclosed articles A. A. Ahmed Agaie , a Mussulman from the Crimea) represents English statesmen as having of repent years adopted a policy inconsistent with British traditions by concluding certain ententes alludino- to the Anglo-Russian entente. The articles inveigh against what they erroneously call the Triple Entente, and try to make Young Turkey incline towards the Triple Alliance. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure 1 in No. 1.

The Mutasarrif replied that he was very glad to hear that the tribe had amicably settled with the bin Thani family and that the settlement was acceptable to him. He also informed them that henceforth the tribe was under Turkish protection and told them that if they are again oppressed by the bin Thani family they should at once report the matter to him in Hasa to enable him to take prompt action against the oppressors. He gave a letter to the visitors for their headman to the above effect. From the above interview it is generally inferred that the A1 bu Ainain are not now anxious for the establishment of a Turkish military post in Wakra and likewise that the Mutasarrif will not at present press the matter any further. v-* ? , !»i * • - » ,' i, ^ tjjL « i t i- Und Seci Cor Un( Seci &gt; j u l&gt;3'9C9 L/» 5 vvj. ■■-s&amp;S&gt; / No. 3460, dated Bushire, the 8th (received 22nd) December 1908 (Confidential), From— Major P.

OrV : FOREIGN OFFICE, Feb ruary 18 th, 1905 Sir :- I have laid before the Marquess of Lansdouuie your letters of December 30th and January 28th last relative to El Katr. The Government of India in their telegram Ox December 30th forward and recommend a suggestion by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that, in view of the objections raised by Sir N. O'Conor to the proposed Agreement with the Sheikh of El Katr on the lines of the Agreements with the Trucial Chiefs of 1892, recourse should, as an alternative, be had to the revival of an Agreement made witn Sheikh Mahomed bin Sanee of El Katr in 18o8. Lord Lansdowne does not think that there would be any advantage in adopting this course. ±he Agreement of 1368 with Sheikh Mahomed is practical ly identical with the Agreements of 1853 with the Trueial The Under Secretary of State, India Office.Truciol Chiefs and deals exclusively with the pre servation of maritime peace among the Arab rulers. Hie Agreements of 1855 were however found insuffi cient to guard against the growing danger of encroach ment or interference hy foreign Powers and it was considered necessary to supplement them hy the Agree ments of 1892 which are at present in force and are intended to guard against such an eventuality. It is to provide against similar encroachments or interference that an Agreement with the Sheikh of El Katr is now desired and if any such Agreement is to he concluded it seems clear that in order to he effective it should he modelled upon the Trucial Agreement of 1892 rather than upon Agreements which have been found in practice to he inadequate for present purposes. It might no douht he argued that the revival of the obsolete Agreement of 1868 with Sheikh Ja- sin does not in the letter constitute a disturb ance of tne Status quo inasmuch as that agreement has never been expressly abandoned or denounced. It could however he made thoroughly effective for thef .&amp; the purpose in view only hy giving it an interpreta tion considerably in excess of what its actual terms would bear. The objections to any course which would con stitute a departure from the status quo apply with even greater force than when they were stated in Mr. / ^ Villiers' letter of the 18th July last. For as a result of repeated representations on the part of His Majesty's Government the Turkish Government have formally suppressed the Mudirate of Wakra, and would now be justified in contending that they on their side have fully acted up to their engagements. Lord Lansdowne is unwilling to encourage any new departure in regard to El Katr without further con sideration. Such a change would be especis.lly inopportune at the present time when a general oen^e of insecurity and suspicion prevails in the neigh bourhood of the Persian Gulf where His Majesty's Government have already more than one embarrassing question to deal with. His Lordship would suggest that the matter should be deferred till the whole questionquestion of the policy to he pursued in the Persian Gulf has been fully examined by the Committ-ii - f Imperial Defence I am.

So far as the matter Gtnhe regarded as a local, one affecting only Indian interests in the Gulf, the balance of advantage seems to Mr. BrodriCh, for the reasons given in the Viceroy's telegram, to lie on the side of concluding an Agreement with Sheikh Ahmed. But if this view is accepted ar.d it is held that there is sufficient urgency to justify the conclusion of an Agreement, the question remains whether it would he better to sanction or. Agreement on the lines of those with the Trueial Oh iefs as recommended in the Government of Inu,ia letter of the 31st March last, or to effect a renewal of the Agreement entered into with Sheikh Ahmea's predecessor in 1868.Tne form of the Treaty of 1868 which the Government of India propose to revise has the disa&amp;vmtcjge of not, on the face of it, exclusing extraneous Ihough' i77terferenoe,J^y providing for the reference of the Chief Is quarrels to the Resident, it might he held indirect to effect that object, and it will he in the recollection of Lord Lansdowne that this was the one object which, in \ Sir IT. O'Conor’s opinion, justified our negotiating for a Treaty at all. On the other hand , the form of the Treaties with the Trucial Chiefs, while it effectually provides for the exclusion of all outside interference, involves the exclusion of Turkey as well as of other nations, and mould, therefore, be more likely to be strongly opposed by the Forte, and, for this reason, Ur. Brodrick inclinesto prefer the- renewal of the old Treaty Of 1868. Ur. BrodrioK, however, would not preen the question of an Agreement, if, in Lord Lansdoune's opinion, our general relations with the Turkish government mahe it distinctly undesirable to tahe such action at present.

My Lord, With reference to the letter from, the Government of India, subject of the proposal to conclude a protectorate treaty with Sheikh From ditto, dated 18th July 1904, and 2 . Your Excellency will observe r. rwnrps. ^ further question should be raised with the Turkish Government at the present moment, when there are already other matters of importance under discussion between the Porte and His Majesty’s Government, and that he does not consider that the conclusion of the proposed agreement with Sheikh Ahmed is warranted by the delay of the Turkish Govern ment in cancelling the Mudirate at Wakra. It appears, however, from his Excellency’s Despatch of 28th June 1904, that he considers that such an agreement might be justified to the Turkish Government on the ground that its object is to give His Majesty’s Government the right to restrain foreign interference in El Katr, without attempting in any other way to disturb the status quo so far as the Turkish Government is concerned. 3. The decision, therefore, depends upon the question whether the objects to be attained by the proposed agreement are of sufficient importance to counterbalance the suspicion and ill-will which it would be calculated to arouse in the minds of the Turkish Government. The El Katr coast at present constitutes a break in the continuity of our maritime influence along the shores of this pait of the Gulf, lying as it does between the island of Bahrein and the Pirate Coast. The absence of any agreement with the Sheikh may prove, in certain contingencies, a hindrance to the proper exercise by His Majesty’s ships of their duties in the suppression of piracy and the maintenance of the peace of the Gulf. It also presents a difficulty of considerable importance from the point of view of the protection of the pearl fisheries from outside interference, to which reference is made in your letter under reply.

Colonel Kemball is of opinion that it is probable that, if the Thani family were assured of support against Turkish encroachment. Sheikh Ahmed would be under no necessity to appeal to the British Government for assistance in exerting his authority over his own tribesmen. In this view the Government of India concur. They point out that there is nothing in the history of our relations with the Trucial Chiefs to justify the apprehension that by renewing the relations with the Thani family, which were established by the Agree ment of 1868 with Sheikh Muhammed-bin-Thani, we should incur inconvenient obligations. . . - • The Government of India also refer to the opinion expressed m the telegram from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople ot the 14th November last.

With reference to your letter of the 18th May, I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to transmit herewith, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, copies of correspondence with His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople relative to the proposal of the Govern ment of India for concluding an agreement with the Sheikh of El Katr, similar to the arrangements with the Trucial Chiefs. Sir N. O’Conor does not consider that it would be possible to justify a convention with the Sheikh of El Katr on the ground of the delay which has occurred in the cancelling of the appointment of the Mudir of Wakra, and His Excellency is justified in stating that he never went further than to express a somewhat hesitating opinion that such an arrangement might possibly be defended as not necessarily inconsistent with the maintenance of the status quo if it were directed solely to the exclusion of foreign interference. At the same time, Lord Lansdowne understands that Sir N. O’Conor does not absolutely oppose the conclusion of an arrangement, if, on general grounds, it is considered expedient. I am, however, to call special attention to his observations as to the cumulative effect of the numerous steps which are being taken in the Gulf in exciting suspicion in the minds of the Turkish Government, and to his recommendation that any steps which are finally decided upon should be carried out as quietly as possible, and should bear the appearance of being directed towards the virtual preservation of the status quo in the Gulf.

Your Excellency will observe that the Secretary of State for India reverts to the question, already discussed in November last, of con cluding an Agreement with Sheikh of El Katr. The arrangement proposed is one similar to that made with the Trucial Chiefs in 1892,| ^ (if copy of which is enclosed for convenience of reference, and the Govern ment of India express the opinion, in which Mr. Brodrick concurs, that the position of the Sheikh is sufficiently established to justify Hi* Majesty s Government in concluding an Agreement with him. Argu ments are also brought forward in connection with the subject of pearl fisheries in the Persian Gulf, to show rhe necessity of g tarJing against foreign interference in the El Katr Peninsula. In your telegram, No. 218 (Secret), of the 14th November last, you expressed your opinion that such an arrangement did not involve any departure from the policy of maintaining the political status quo in the Gulf to which His Majesty’s Government have declared that they adhere. I should wish to learn whether in your opinion His Majesty’s Government are not entitled to contend that the step has been rendered necessary, as a legitimate measure of protection for their interests, by the continued delay of the Turkish Government in suppressing the Mud irate of Wakra. I should also he glad to receive any general observations which you may have to offer on the questions raised in the correspondence. His Excellency, The Bight Hon. Sir N.

I have carefully considered the subject and correspondence in your Lordship’s Despatch No. 203 of the 7th instant, and beg to offer the following remarks : — In the first place, I do not think it is possible to justify a Convention with Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani, of El Katr, on the ground of the delay which has occurred in the cancelling of the appointment of the Mudir of Wakra. The Ottoman Government have agreed, although reluctantly, to annul the appointment, and Mr. Crow’s Despatch No. 25 of the 16th ultimo, shows that although action has been delayed the Yali does not deny that he has received instructions in the sense desiied by His Majesty’s Government, or that he will attempt ultimately to e\ade ^In m^telegram No. 218 (Secret), of the 14th November 1903, I carefully refrained from expressing the opinion, as your Lordship s Despatch under acknowledgment seems to infer, that an arrangement such as the Convention with the Trucial Chiefs did not involve any departure from the policy of maintaining the political status quo m thp Persian Gulf, to which His Majesty’s Government have declared their adhesion. The question seemed to be one essentially requiring careful consideration, setting its urgency and advantages against the ill-feeling which it will provoke in the minds of the Ottoman Government, and seein°* how far it could be justified as giving His Majesty s Government the right to restrain foreign interference in El Katr without attempting in anv other way to disturb, ms-a-vis to the Xurlish Government, the Jatus quo. This is the one argument that will be of much use m reconciling the Turkish Government to the bonvention, althoug X should also remind them that it was only a continuance of the Agree ment made in 1868 with Sheikh Mohammad-bm-Tham, referred to m India Office letter of the 18th May. In any cas^ I would suggest, should His Majesty’s Government decide in favour of concluding a Convention with Sheikh Ahmed on the huesof the Trucial Conventions, the expediency of doing so in as qme, ant secret a manner as possible, and basing their action upon the nocessi y of acquiring power to suppress piracy and to maintain intact the pea fishing rights of the Arab tribes on the coast. . T u m I do not consider that it is your Lordship s desire that I express my opinion on the merits and necessity of le po icy prompts the Government of India to advocate a Convention with the Sheikh of Katr, Ahmed-bin-Thani, as there are others far more competent to give a valuable opinion upon this subject. But I would venture to poiSt out to your Lordship that at the present moment we are threatening Turkey with an armed expedition, to be manned by Bahreinese and supported by England, to avenge the murder of Sheikh Selman, committed by the Almurrah tribe m revenge for tne mmder of some of their people; that it has been decided to establish a British post-office at Koweit and to attach a Resident to the Sheikh; and that we are at the same time insisting upon the removal of the lurivisn military post from Bubian Island, as also from Urn Kasr although not with quite the same pressure.

Your Excellency will observe that His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople regrets that a further question should be raised with the Turkish Government at the present moment, when there are already other matters of importance under discussion between the Porte and His Majesty’s Government, and that he does not consider that the conclusion of the proposed agreement with Sheikh Ahmed is warranted by the delay of the Turkish Govern ment in cancelling the Mudirate at Wakra. It appears, however, from ^his Excellency’s Despatch of 28th June 1904, that he considers that such an agreement might be justified to the Turkish Government on the ground that its object is to give His Majesty’s Government the right to restrain foreign interference in El Katr, without attempting in any other way to disturb the status quo so far as the Turkish Government is concerned. 3. The decision, therefore, depends upon the question whether the objects to be attained by the proposed agreement are of sufficient importance to counterbalance the suspicion and ill-will which it would be calculated to arouse in the minds of the Turkish Government. The El Katr coast at present constitutes a break in the continuity of our maritime influence along the shores of this part of the Gulf, lying as it does between the island of Bahrein and the Pirate Coast. The absence of any agreement with the Sheikh may prove, in centum contingencies, a hindrance to the proper exercise by His Majesty’s ships of their duties in the suppression of piracy and the maintenance of the peace of the Gulf. It also presents a difficulty of considerable importance from the point of view of the protection of the pearl fiisheries from outside interference, to which reference is made in your letter under reply, S. 35.

Kemball, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—L. W. Dane, Esq., I.C.S., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I liave the honour to report that Sheikh Zaid bin Khalifa, Chief of Abu Dhabi, has written to me requesting permission to reoccupy Odeid. 2. When I visited Abu Dhabi last October, the question of Odeid came up during my meeting with the Sheikh, who appeared to be somewhat anxious regarding the reported intention on the part of the Turks to send a Mudir to that place. 3. Early in January I received a letter from Sheikh Zaid on the subject, and the Assistant Political Agent also wrote to me forwarding copy of a letter addressed to him by the Sheikh. Copies of these letters are herewith submitted for your information. It may perhaps be thought on a perusal of the Chief’s letters that I had expressed a wish that he should rebuild Odeid. This is not the case. I merely asked the Chief in course of conversation, in which he laid stress on his right of ownership of Odeid, if he thought he was in a position to reoccupy the place. The Chief said that he would have to think the matter over. 4. On receipt of the Chief’s letter, I considered it advisable before sub- mitting the request for the consideration of the Government of India to enquire from the Chief if he thought he was strong enough to hold the place, as in 1892, when Colonel Talbot, then Resident, spoke to him on the subject he had said that he was not strong enough to hold his own against the Bedouins. I have now received the Chief’s reply which is to the effect that he cannot ^rebuild Odeid unless he is assured of the approval and support of His Majesty’s^ Gov ernment. He does not appear to anticipate any difficulty of holding his own against the Bedouins, but what he evidently desires is an assurance of our sup- port in case of interference by the Turks or by others instigated by them. 5 It is not necessary for me to enter here on any discussion regarding the \ ri^ht of the Chief of Abu Dhabi to occupy Odeid. His rights of ownership are undoubted, but the point for consideration is whether the reoccupation by him orthe place at the present time may not be a cause of inconvenience as impos- | in' upon Bis Majesty’s Government the obligation to protect the new settle- ^ ment from hostile attack by sea. I am not inclined to think that this is verv great On the other hand the occupation of Odeid by a Trucial ^hiei is likely to be advantageous from our point of view, as it would finally put a stop to the pretensions of the Turks, and, as pointed out by Mr. Gaskin, would probably promote our trade interests. There seems to me that therpis no sufficient reason why the place .should remain for ever unoccupied, and think that the Chief of Abu Dhabi might be given the permission for which he asks. 6. I have informed the Sheikh that his request has been referred for the consideration and orders of the Government of India and that meanwhile he should make no move in the matter. / C4 (j 0 I * ■'V- ' ■ . .

Calcoti Gaskin, Esq, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, To— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to forward in original with a translation for your in formation a letter, dated the 1st January 1901, I have received from Sheikh Zaid bin Khalifah, Chief of Abu Dhabi, on the subject of his rebuilding Odeid which matter was discussed by you with him on the occasion of your tour to the Arab Coast in October last. The rebuilding of Odeid will have a detrimental effect on A1 Bidda and Wakra, from which places it will draw some of their residents. Odeid possesses one of the most secure harbours for native craft on this side of the Persian Gulf. It will become a centre for the pearl trade in that region much to the disadv antage of A1 Bidda which now has a large share of the trade on account of its proximity to the central pearl banks. A new market will be opened for our enterprising British Indians w r ho wdll probably share in the Katr pearl trade which is now exclusively in the hands of Sheikh Ahmed bin Thani and his nephews. The port is situated about thirty miles nearer to Bahrein than to Abu Dhabi for sailing vessels, so that possibly it will draw some of its supplies from Bahrein. And finally it will put an effectual stop to Turkish pretensions to it. The extra responsibility devolving upon His Majesty’s Government by the venture may be described as nominal only. After the severe check received by the Turks in their attempt on Bahrein in 1895 they will hardly lay themselves open again to any similar demoralizing rebuff by instigating the Katr Arabs to attack Odeid by sea and should they be so ill-advised as to do so, the Arabs of that region are not likely to listen to them after what they experienced on the occasion referred to. The only other danger is that it may be open to attack from the land side by raiding Bedouins. The nearest water-supply accessible to an hostile party is in the vicinity of Wajba about fifty miles away, so that an attempt would be attended with serious risks, the contingency is therefore remote in the extreme. 6 I am sending a reply to Sheikh Zaid by the messenger who brought his letter, to the effect that the letter has been sent on to you and that you will probably communicate with him on the subject. Translation of a letter, dated the 1st January 1904, from Sheikh Zaid bin Kkalifah, Chief of Abu Dhabi, to J. Calcott Gaskin, Esquire, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein. Let it not be hidden from you that, with reference to the matter regarding the building of the town of Odeid mentioned by you at our parting when the Political Resident was present, I am obedient to carry out the same and now have resolved to rebuild the place. It is begged and hoped of God and the British Government to increase their splendour and extend their benevolence towards me. I wished to inform you of my resolve so that you may know of it as I am confident in God and then you for your gracious assistance. Please God.

Past experience, moreover, shows that the place has been a source of considerable trouble to the Sheikh, being used as a resort by seceders from his authority and _ . J , , , asa ref uge by pirates. If the Sheikh weie now again to people the place, it is probable that the settlers would again secede and would form a fresh cause of embarrassment to Sheikh Zaid Vide letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, No. 232, dated 30th October 1878, and No. 20 from ditto ditto to ditto ditto, dated the 14th January 1879. 3. Prom the point of view of British interests there appears at present to Fide despatch No. 77, Secret—External, dated 31st UO reason why the Government of fouthisday. 0 * which copy Las beea forwarded t0 India should lend their support to the n . enterprise. The sanction of His Maiestv’s Government has recently been asked to the conclusion of an agreement with the Sheikh of El Katr, and if this proposal be approved the chances of Turkish encroacaments in this quarter will in the future be much reduced. There will be no reason for wishing to establish a port to rival those of El Katr and indeed it will probably be inadvisable that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi should re-occupy a place which has been a cause of contention between himself and the Bin Thani family in the past, and the repopulation of which might easily become a source of fresh quarrels in the future. f For the above reasons the Government of India are inclined to think tha. m present circumstances the place should be left uninhabited and that, unless there are^ other strong reasons which have not been mentioned, there are, at the present time, no sufficient advantages in lending any encouragement to the re-occupation of the place by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. Before passing final orders in the matter, however, I am to enquire whether Colonel Kemball’s suggestion was actuated by any considerations other than those mentioned in his letter.(Copy) n Uo. 195 of 1904.

Tte decision, therefore, depends upon the question whether the objects to be attained by the proposed agreement are of sufficient importance to counter- balance the suspicion and ill-will which it would be calculated to arouse in the minds of the Turkish Govt. The El Kafr coast at present constitutes a break in the continuity of our maritime influence along the shores of this part of the Gulf, lying as it does between the island of Bahrein and the Pirate Coast. The absence of any agreement with the Sheikh iy J/a^ v_ - may prove, in certain oantingenoies, a hindtranoe to the proper exercise by H.U. ships of their duties in the suppression of piracy and the maintenance of the peace of the Gulf.

At the same time Lord Lansdowne understands that Sir N. 0*Conor does not absolutely oppose the con clusion of an arrangement if on general grounds it is considered expedient. I am, however, to call special attention to his observations as to the cumu lative effect of the numerous steps which are being taken in the Gulf in exciting suspicion in the minds of the Turkish Government and to his recommendation that any steps which are finally decided upon should be carried out as quietly as possible and should bear the appearance of being directed towards the virtual preservation of the status quo in the Gulf. I am. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,Copy. No.516. Secret. THERAPIA, June 28 tlx ; 1904. Ivly Lord: - I have carefully/ considered the subject and correspondence in Your Lordship*s despaben No.203 of the 7th instant and beg to offer the following renarns. In the first place I do not think it is possible to justify a convention with Sheikh Ah/ied Bin Than! of El Katr on the ground of the delay which Ms occurred in the cancelling of the appointment of the Mudir of Wakra. The Ottoman Government nave agreed although reluctantly to annul the appointment, and Mr. Crow's despatch No.25 of the 15th May shows that although action has been delayed the Vali does not deny that he has received instructions in the sense desired by His Majesty's Government or that he will attempt ultimately to evade their execution. In my telegram No.218 secret of the 14th of November 1903 I carefully refrained from express- ing The Marquess of Lonsdowns, K.G., n aexpressing the opinion^ as Your Lordship's despatch under acknowledgment seems to infer that an ar rangement such as the Convention with the Trucial Chiefs did not involve any departure from the policy of maintaining the political Status Quo in the Persian Culf, to which His Majesty's Gov ernment have declared their adhesion. The question seemed to he one essentially requiring careful consideration, setting its ur gency and advantages against the Ill-fe eling whlch ^ it will provoke in the minds of the Ottoman Gov ernment, and seeing how far it could he justified as giving His Majesty's Government the right to restrain foreign interference in El Katr without attempting in any other way to disturb vis h vis to the Turkish Government the Status Quo. This is the one argument that will he of much use in reconciling the Turkish Government to the Conven tion, although I should also remind them that it was oily a continuance of the Agreement made in 1858 with Sheikh Mohammad Bin Thani, referred to S3 in the India Office letter of the SQth May.In any case I would suggest should His Majesty’s Government decide in favour of concluding a Conven tion with Sheikh Ahmed on the lines of the Trucial Conventions, the expediency of doing so in as quiet and secret a manner as possible and h^lm^their ac tion upon the necessity of acquiring power to sup press piracy and to maintain intact the Pearl iisu ing rights of the Arab tribes on the Coast. I do not consider that it is Your Lordsnip 1 s desire that I should express my opinion on the mer its and necessity of the policy that prompts the Government of India to advocate a Convenuion wion the Sheikh of Katr, Ahmed Bin Thani, as there are others far more competent to give a valuaole opinion upon this .subject. But I would venture to point out to Your Lordship that at the present moineno we are j threatening Turkey with an armed expedition uo oe 1 manned by Bahrelnese and supported by England to ^ I avenge the murder of Sheikh Selnan committed by the lAlmurrah tribe in revenge for the murder of some of their people; a British Pos that it has been decided to establish t Office at Koweit and to a ttach a ResiResident to the Sheikh; and that we are at the sane time insisting upon the removal oi the Turk ish military Post from Buhl an Island as also from Un Kasr, although not with quite the same pressure.

Were it not that Abdul Rahman is a local Sheikh the best solution would be to deport him forcibly, but in view of the local position there would probably be objections to this course. I should like to The Mar que ss of Lan s down e .K.0., 4c., 4c., 4c.,to know whether the deni a] by the Minister of the In terior that he holds any official Turkish position such as Mudir, is considered satisfactory. I have communicated with His Majesty's Consul at Basrah, who enquires whether it would be necessary to move further in the matter if it were ascertained that Sheikh Abdul Rahman was not actually exercising any administrative functions.

O'Conor.To The Right Hon’ble St. JOHN BRODRICK, His Majesty 1 s Secretary of State for India. Fort William, the 31st March 1904. Sir, We have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with your Secret telegram No. 104 C., dated the 18th November 1903, on the subject of a Protectorate Treaty with Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani of El Katr. 2. The decision of His Majesty’s Government that no agreement should at present be concluded with this Chief appears to have been based on tw 7 o main considerations, first, that such a Convention would constitute a disturb ance of the status quo which, in view of the promise of the Turks to cancel the appointments of Mudirs in El Katr which they had made in violation of the understanding to respect the status quo, was held to be unjustifiable, and, secondly, that the influence of Sheikh Ahmed was on the wane, and that an arrangement with His Majesty’s Government would only be used by the Chief to retrieve his diminishing influence. 3. With reference to the former objection, we observe that His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople is of opinion that, though the formal declaration of a protectorate might be considered contrary to the spirit of our recent representations to the Porte, we might be justified in making an agreement with the Sheikh, wuth the object of securing the maintenance of the position which the remonstrances of His Majesty’s Government have so far partially preserved, and of excluding the possibility of foreign interference in the future. We concur in Sir Nicolas O’Conor’s view. We submit that the action of the Turkish Government and of their local officials has not been such as to require any excess of forbearance on our part: the more so in that, so far as we are aware, they have failed to carry out the undertaking given by the - f Grand Vizier more than six months ago that their recent nominee for the Mudirate at Wakra should fo rmally be deprived of his title; while we observe that so recently as the~-2St?n5ecember 1903 Mr. Crow reported to Sir Nicolas O’Conor the arrival at Basrah of a battalion intended for the El Katr Peninsula. At any rate the Turkish Government could hardly object to our entering into friendly relations with the successor of Sheikh Muhammad-bin-Tham, with whom Colonel Pelly concluded a treaty on 12th September 1868. 4 As will be seen from his letter * which we now enclose, we called for a • From 0%.

From—L ieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Officiting Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Depart ment. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 2042-E., dated 3rd October 1902, in which I was directed to furnish a report as to the actual position of Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani in El Katr. Erom the enclosed report submitted to me by the Assistant Political Agent No. 257. dried the 14th December 1902. f ? al '' ein ^ t W .° Uld aPPear Jasim-bm-Tham is the recognised Chief of Katr, and that he holds the title of Kaimmakam from the Turks. Sheikh Ahmed, however, appears to be the de facto Chief, and it is considered probable tteatTon Sheikh Jasim’s death he will succeed to the Chiefship. I may mention that the Chief of Bahrein is at present on friendly terms with Sheikh Ahmed and is in a position to know the actual state of affairs in Katr. 2. I find from the records of my office that, when Colonel Meade visited Al-Makra in 1899, in connection with the piracies which had recently been committed off the Katr Coast, he met Sheikh Ahmed, who then expressed a desire to enter into closer relations with the British Government, and asked if he and his people might be permitted to occupy Odeid. Colonel Meade informed the Sheikh that the matter would have to be referred to the Govern ment of India, and I understand that he was expecting a letter from Sheikh Ahmed before making an official reference to Government. Odeid as the Government of India is aware, is, although still unoccupied, considered to he an appanage of Abu Dhabi, and in any ease we could not allow it to he occupied except by a Chief who would be entirely under our protection. No. 257, dated Bahrein, the 14th December 1902. From - J. C. Gaskin, Esq., Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, rf 0 Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. With reference to the desire of the Government of India to know the a-tual position of Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani, I have Gie honour to report that I have made careful enquiries regarding this person from reliable sources, and have ascertained that on the demise of Sheikh Jasim he is likely to succeed to the Sheikhdom of Katr if the Turks do not interfere in the affairs of that district.5r^ I. f Sheikh Jasim is recognised by the tribesmen and Turks as the Chief, and from the latter he holds the title of Kaimmakam, but he repudiates the title and has for a number of years left his brother, Ahmed, to deal with the Turks at A1 Bidaa. All official correspondence, however, is addressed by the Turks to Sheikh Jasim, whom they hold responsible for the behaviour of the tribes. Sheikh Jasim has four grown-up sons and five young ones, but none of these appear to interest themselves in the affairs of the district, and due to the habit of Sheikh Ahmed assisting his brother in tribal affairs and being left to deal with the Turks stationed in Katr and share in the government of the district generally, he has acquired power and authority which the Turks and tribesmen respect, and which his nephews are not strong enough to wrest from him With a view to avoid disruption in the family, and rendering it weak to withstand further Turkish encroachment in Katr, Sheik Jasim recognises the position of his brother and has made no attempt to ensure the leadership to either of his sons on his death, and these facts are, in my opinion, sufficiently significant to inspire a strong belief in the probability of Sheikh Ahmed succeeding his brother. The Chief of Bahrein, whom I questioned on the sub ject, and who is well informed in the affairs of Katr, entertains the same views as regards the position of Sheikh Ahmed. Telegram, dated the 10th January 1903. From—The Foreign Secretary, His Excellency the Viceroy’s Camp, Rnra, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, My letter 2042 E. of 3rd October 1902. El Katr. Eollowing telegram from Secretary State, dated 22nd December:— Begins. O^onor reports announcement in semi-official newspaper “Ikdam” of 27 th November of intention of Turkish Government to establish small administrateve units at Zobara, at Dikchir, at Adide, which is presumably El Odeid, and at Jezireh-ul- Amair, which he identifies with Abuali island. O’Conor fears protest will be considerably resented, having regard to Turkish feeling about Koweit and Aden delimitation, and adds that, though it may be advisable to protest for political reasons, he does not expect any result unless we are prepared to go further. Please let me have your views. See my Secret despatch No. 37 of 5th Sep tember last. Ends. Please give your views with as little delay as possible. Abuali island is perhaps Jezirat Ali. Where is Dikchir? Telegram, dated the 14th January 1903. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To —The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. Your telegram of the 10th January. I cannot identify Zoheradikchir (sec). It may be Zobara, or else place on the opposite coast of Katr named Dhakira on the chart. If Zobara is meant, objections to its occupation by the Turks are strong and are well known to the Government of India. The same remark applies to Odeid. If another place in Katr is meant, objections might not be so strong as to Zobara, but it seems probable that extension of Turkish autho rity in Katr may adversely affect our interests hereafter. In any case, our relations with Bahrein and Abu Tkabi rendered it necessary to prevent the occupation of Zobara and Odeid. Amair must be island referred to in my letter No. 95, 2(ith April last. It is north of Katif, and its occupation does not concern us. Telegram, dated the 27th February 1903. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. To—Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. My telegram of the 14th January. El Katr. Reports from Bahrein con firm announcement made by “ Ikdam.” Private Secretary to Governor of Hassareeentiy visited Bahrein, and told Gaskin that the proposal had been contem- pmtea tor some time, and that he believed that the posts were to be at Odeid, Wakra, Zobara, and Musalamiya island. Officer for Wakra-named Yusuf .htiendi—has been appointed, but is apparently still at Hassa, waiting for fur ther orders from the Porte. Officers for the other places have notVet been appointed. No. 47, dated Bushire, the 23rd March 1903 (Confidential). From Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to report, with reference to my telegram dated 12th March, on the subject of El Katr, that, on the 16th instant, the mail steamer from Basrah arrived in Bushire. Abdul Karim Effendi, the Mudir-designate for Odeid, was on board en route to Bahrein. I had him interviewed, and he stated that his destination had been altered. He was to have gone to Odeid, but he knew what a desolate place Odeid was, and he had managed to arrange a transfer to another place called Alayun, which I am unable to locate, but which is, I believe, somewhere near Katif or Al Hasa, and he was on his way to Al Hasa to obtain orders from the Mutessarif. As regards Odeid he stated that another officer, whose name he did not know, had been appointed as Mudir. He was of Kurdish origin and was now in Basrah, and would probably come to Bahrein by the following mail. He stated that Sheikh Jasim-bin- Thani had asked the Porte to establish administrative units at Zobara, Wakra, and Odeid, and that Arabi Effendi, who had gone to Bahrien by the preceding mail steamer, was nominated to the Zobara Mudirich, and that Yusuf Beg, now at Al Hasa, was to go to Wakra. He did not know the number of soldiers to be stationed at the new posts. 2. It is, I think, very probable that Sheikh Jasim has recommended to the Porte the establishment of ^ these posts. The, Turkish authorities have, I believe, been for some time anxious to get hold of Sheikh Jasim, and I gather that they wish to hold him responsible for the recently disturbed state of the country between Ojair and Al Hasa. Sheikh Jasim has therefore, in order to absolve himself from responsibility, recommended ,the Turks to establish posts at several points on Katr, knowing that we should not view with equanimity any occupation of Zobara and Odeid, and wishing to embroil the Turks with us. 3. It is, in my opinion, absolutely essential for the security of the Bahrein islands that Zobara should not be occupied by the Turks. Apart from the fact that the occupation of Zobara would be viewed with the greatest concern by the Chief of Bahrein, who considers the place to be an appanage of his, and whose rights we are bound to maintain, the prestige which the Turks would gain throughout the countryside by the occupation of this place, in opposition to the well-known views of the British Government, would be so great that an attack on Bahrein from Katr could at any time be organised, and the continual presence of a ship of war in Bahrein waters, and perhaps even a military occupation of the islands, would be required. Regard ing the occupation by the Turks and other places on El Katr it is not, I think, necessary for me at the present time to add anything to what has already been said on the subject.

Probability is that, after the occupation of El Bidaa, Chief of Katr, was told (to) fly Turkish flag, and that it is hoisted when ships are seen. Sphinx reports no Sheikhs there, but headman of (one group missing) told Commander flag had no political significance. Chief of Katr has, as Government of India know, admitted Turkish sovereignty, but this has never been considered to affect our policy with regard to Katr. Gaskin reports, 24th April, Yusuf Beg still at Bahrein. He has eleven of the Hassa Governor’s men with him to assist him at Wakra, and he will probably take soldiers from Bidaa he withdrawn from {sic). Officials for the other place were at Hassa ■waiting for orders from Constantinople. I have little doubt that Katr Chief, if assured of our protection against Turks, would not allow Turkish officials at Wakra. Telegram, dated tlie 28th April 1903.

I have the honour to forward extract from a letter, dated 1st instant, addressed to me by the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, relative to the appointments of Turkish Mudirs to Zobara and Odeid. I will enquire from His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah if he has any confirmation of the report that Arabi Etfendi has returned to Basrah. cj &gt; i i T t y Extract from a demi-official letter from the Assistant Political Affent, Bahrein, to the Political Besident, Persian Gulf, dated the 1st June 1903. The Treasurer of the Ojair Customs, who passed through ^ yesterday on a visit to Katif, called on me yesterday. In the conversation with him I fathered that Arabi Effendi, who was appointed of Zobara, appears to have been a troublesome person and fell out with the Mutassanf of A1 Hassa, and left for Basrah by the Jdna from Katiff about the 10th May. I have no means of confirming this news, and I wonder whether it is true, and the reason for his departure is the right one. Such people do not draw pay until t ey take over their appointments, and it is quite possible that he was getting tired of waiting at Al Hassa and drawing no pay m the meantime made him des perate. Abdul Karim Effendi, the Mudir of Odeid, is still at Al Hassa. No. 107, duted Bushire, the 5th June 1903 (Confidential). From— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to your telegram dated the 31st ultimo, and tinn of mv telegram dated the 2nd instant, on the subiect of the lurkish Mudir Yusu Bel who recently arrived at Wakra, I have the honour to say that I am very doubtful if the man's removal could be effected under pressure of a British ship of war without raising local difiiculties. Yusuf Be-, it must be remembered, has gone to Wakra under orders of when the British ship had left. It is impossible to say that l°° al would not he raised if force had to be employed to remove Yusuf Be D 4762 F. D.6 i/f * Wakra ; and I am, therefore, of opinion that, as His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople is assured that the Porte will recall Yusuf Beg, no definite steps, such as those suggested in the telegram from the Secretary of State, should be taken at present. Ido not consider that the objection to Yusuf Beg’s remaining at Wakra for a short time longer is very great, so long as his ultimate recall is brought about, although I should regard in a different light any attempt to post Mudirs, at Zobara or Odeid 1 think, however, that, as sufficient time has elapsed for the orders which, it is alleged, the Wali at Basrah has transmitted to the Mutassarif at A1 Hassa to have reached Wakra, the Porte should be asked to issue fresh orders for Yusuf Beg’s immediate recall, these orders being of a nature so clear and definite that the Mutassarif will have no choice but to see that they are complied with at once.

In reply to your despatch No. 457 of 5th June, I have the honour to inform yon that Arabi Effendi, late Mudir of Zobara, has returned to Basrah. The Mutassarif of Hassa has, so the Wali informs me, written to His Excel lency urging the appointment of some one in bis place, but the Wali states that he has instructed him to appoint no more Mudirs till further orders.

In continuation of my letter No. 125, dated the 21st June 1903, I have the honour to report that Abdul Karim Effendi, hearing that the S.S. Henry Bolckow was to arrive here shortly and was going to Basrah, he postponed his departure with a view to proceed by that vessel. Immediately after the departure of the mail steamer for Bushire the S.S. Hoseinee arrived here, and it appears that Abdul Karim Effendi’s family joined some other passengers at Basrah and came by the latter vessel; and there being no further necessity for his proceeding to Basrah, Abdul Karim Effendi left Bahrein with family for Al Hassa via Ojair on Thursday afternoon. The Kaimmakam of Al Bidaa, Abdul Kadir Effendi, arrived here on the 25th instant on his way to Al Hassa. He informed my confidential agent that he received a letter from the Mutessarif about three weeks ago to the effect that he should proceed to Al Hassa, as he wished to discuss Katr affairs with him, and that, as Yusuf Beg had nothing to do at Wakra and was at El Bidaa, he appointed the latter to act for him during his absence from the post;. I have received a letter from a correspondent in Al Bidaa corroborating this information. No. 140, dated Bn shire, the 24th July 1903. Pj.qoj Captain V. deV.

This fact may be brought to the notice of His Excellency the Wali of Basra through his Britannic Majesty’s Consul. It would seem from this information that the Mutassarif has not entirely carried out the orders alleged to have been sent by the Turkish Government, and is temporizing until further correspondence on the subject passes between him and the Porte, and the withdrawal of Yusuf Beg to El Bidaa is only a temporary measure to make it appear that he has been removed.

Adverting to correspondence ending with this office letter No. 158, dated ihe 18th July 1903, I have the honour to report that, on the occasion of a visit paid to me by Sheik Muhammad Abdul Wahab Pasha on the 22nd instant, he stated in his conversation that His Excellency the Wali of Basrah sent a despatch by the Turkish transport Adana which reached Katif on the 3rd instant, to the Mutassarif of A1 Hassa, to the effect that Yusuf Beg should be dismissed from his post, and he is to be given no other Government employment. The Mutassarif has apparently carried out the orders sent him, and Yusuf Beg arrived hereon Friday evening in a sailing boat from Al Bidaa. He states that he has been directed by the MuPssarif to go and see him at Al Hassa, whence he will go back to Basrah, and that the Mutessarif has written officially to Abdul Rahman, son of Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani of Katr appointing him Mudir of Wakra on a salary of 62 Austrian dollars a month. A confiden tial agent, who came from El Bidaa by the same boat, states that Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani informed him of the appointment of his nephew to tbe Wakra post on the pay stated above, so there can be no doubt of the new appointment having been made.V. 9 Notwithstanding the explicit statement of His Excellency the Wali of .oasran to the effect that he has instructed him to appoint no more Mndirs till turther orders as communicated by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, in the confidential despatch No. 9, dated the 9r,h June 1903, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Mutassarif has made the new nomination a Ai ^i-o 81 ^ 1011 ln . conse q ue nce is in no way altered. The nomination of Abdul Rahman, I think, shows that the Turks do not intend to adhere to the declarations made to our Ambassador at Constantinople, and further represent ations to the Porte will be necessary for the abolishment of the post. I regret to state that I have been misinformed as regards the name of the Turkish official holding the post at El Bidaa mentioned in the last paraoraph of my letter No. 129, dated the 28th June 1903.

Abdur Rahman has for some time past been acting as Sheikh of Wakra as Deputy for his father, Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani, Chief of Katr; it is, therefore, not understood how the Turks can now have appointed him Sheikh of the place and assigned him a salary as such. Moreover, as the Katr peninsula is beyond the sphere in which the nominal suzerainty of the Porte has been recognised by His Majesty’s Government, it is not to be supposed that the latter will acquiesce in the appointment of any administrative official by the Turks in that region whether he be styled Sheikh or Mudir. 4762 F D. /A 1 ATelegram, No. 189C-E., dated the 16th August 1903.

The Turkish Government courier from A1 Hassa arriving at El Bidaa on the 24th August, brought a letter from the Mutassarif, in which he asks Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani to give a guarantee for the future good behaviour of Sheikh Abdul Rahman-bin-Jasim, Mudir of Wakra ; and that Sheikh Ahmed dictated to his scribe on the 26th August, in the presence of Abdul Rahman-al-W'azzan, a letter in reply to the effect that there is no need for a paid Mudir at Wakra,to whose appointment the local people object, and that Sheikh Abdul Rahman- bm-Jasim having already been placed at Wakra by his father to attend to the aftairs of the town, there is no occasion for giving him a monthly salary of o2 dollars, consequently the call for a guarantee was unnecessary. ^ rr seem that the Mutassarif is still endeavouring to establish a paid lurkish official at Wakra, and Sheikh Ahmad-bin-Thani now sees the danger threatening their independence, and is trying to prevent the appointment becoming an accomplished fact.

I am inclined to doubt if it is the case that the influence of the Thani family in Katr is rapidly waning. It may, however, be less than it was for the reasons explained by the Assistant Political Agent. What these people fear is the extension of Turkish rule over Katr, as they know that they could not resist the Turks for long; and it is for this reason that the arrangement with His Majesty’s Government is desired. If they were assured of the support of the British Government against Turkish encroachments, it is probable that the position of the family with regard to the tribes in Katr would be strengthened, and Sheikh Ahmed would have no necessity to appeal for support in asserting his authority over his own tribesmen.To—The Secretary to the Government o*£ India in the Foreign Department.

The Marquess of Lansdowne has given careful con sideration to your letters of the 11th and 12th in- . f / slants as to the expediency of concluding an agreement k M f i/ 1 with Sheikh Ahrned-bin-Thani described as the principal 2/T chief of the El Katr peninsula. /V / His Lordship thought it desirable to consult His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople as to the atti tude and probable intentions of the Turkish Government ijil '/* of k id k to ito and I am to enclose for Mr. Secretary Brodrick's in formation copies of the telegraphic correspondence which has passed. It will be seen that Sir N. O'Conor sees no ground for apprehending aggressive action on tne part of the Turkish Government in the near future. Lord Lansdowne concurs in Mr. Brodrick's view that the situation is still governed by the considerations stated he Under Secretary of state, India Office.stated in the last of February 4th last ragraph of Sir H. Walpole’s letter and that in view of the compliance inient with the status quo in in these regions by withdrawing tne Mudirs appo Mudirs appointed to Zobara and Wakra, His Majesty’s Government could not properly or consistently enter into any agreement with the Sheikh having the nature of a in itself clearly undesirable. On September 5th, 1302, after communication with this Department, Lord G.Hamilton authorized the Government of India to instruct the Poli tical Resident in the Persian Gulf to institute enquiries into the real position of Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani on the strict understanding that no further steps should be taken in the direction of the proposed agreement until His Majesty’s Government should have had an opportunity of reconsidering the situation in the light of the informa- Protectorate and obviously constituting a departure from the status quo on their part. Any unnecessary extension of the responsibilities of His Majesty’s Government in this respect is moreover tioniniorroation 'thus obtained. The despatch from the Assistant Political Resident at Bahrein, forwarded in your letter of the 11th instant shows that the in fluence of the Than! family is rapidly waning. There seems indeed ground for inferring from the facts stated hi. Gaskin that Sheikh Ahmed desires the arrangement with His Majesty*s Government primarily in order to secure his position and that he would probably at once make appeals for their support in asserting his diminish ing authority over the tribes in the peninsula. In these circumstances Lord Lansdowne is of opinion that any communications to the Sheikh should oe limited to assurances of the continued friendship of His Majesty s Government so 1ong as he abstains from entering into engagements with other Powers.

As regards his son, Abdul Rahman, he stated that he was made Sheikh of Wakra 5 years ago by Sheikh Ahmed; and though he heard of the recent action of the Mutassarif of Al Hassa, he paid no attention to it and left Ahmed to deal with the matter. I concluded from his manner that he disapproved of the Turks appointing his son Mudir of Wakra. Before leaving I requested him to send a messenger overland to Al Bidda with a letter, directing Sheikh Ahmed to meet me at Wakra. Sheikh Jassim has settled in Lusail with his own household and two or three families of his own followers only.

The Turkish Government courier from A1 Hassa arriving at A1 Bidda on the 24th August, brought a letter from the Mutassarif, in which he asks Sheikh Jasim-bin-Tham to give a guarantee for the future good behaviour of Sheikh Abdul Bahman-bin-Jasim, Mudir of Wakra; and that Sheikh Ahmed dictated to his scribe on the 26th August, in the presence of Abdul Rahman-al- Wazzan, a letter in reply to the effect that there is no need for a paid Mudir at Wakra, to whose appointment the local people object, and that Sheikh Abdul Rahman-bin-Jasim having already been placed at Wakra by his father to attend to the affairs of the town, there is no occasion for giving him a monthly salary of 52 dollars, consequently the call for a guarantee was unnecessary. It would seem that the Mutassarif is still endeavouring to establish a paid Turkish official at Wakra, and Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani now sees the danger threatening their independence, and is trying to prevent the appointment becoming an accomplished fact. i Foreign Office Press—No, 1166—29-9»03—40,Sir: FOREIGN OFFICE, September 22nd, I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant relative to piracy in the neighbourhood of Katlf, and to transmit to you, for the Information of the Secretary of State for India, copy of a despatch nopie on the subject.

Abdur Kahman has for some time past been acting as Sheikh of Wakra as Deputy for his father, Sheikh Jasim-hin-Thani, Chief of Katr; it is, therefore, not understood how the Turks can now have appointed him Sheikh of the place and assigned him a salary as such. Moreover, as the Katr peninsula is beyond the sphere in which the nominal suzerainty of the Porte has been recognised by His Majesty’s Government, it is not to be supposed that the latter will acquiesce in the appointment of any administrative official by the Turks in that region whether he be styled Sheikh or Mudir.Ho. 155 of 1903. \WJ British Residency and Consulate-General Bushire, 20th August 1903. ^ Captain Vere de Vere Hunt, I.A., for Offg: Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To L. ’,7.

The nomination ot Abdul Bahman, I think, shows that tbe Turks do not intend to adhere to the declarations made to our Ambassador at Constantinople, and further represent ations to the Porte will be necessary for tbe abolishment of the post.

The Vali stated yesterday that the Mutessarif of Hassa had written urging the appointment of some one in his place. fly dragoman, to whom he imparted this information, reminded His Excellency that he had already sent orders to recall all the Mudirs, in accordance with the Grand Vizier’s instructions. Whereupon the Vali appeared taken aback and summoned his Secretary, and, in my dragoman's presence, direct ed him to write again to the Mutessarif and instruct him 'on political grounds,' to appoint no more Mudirs till further orders. This letter was sent yesterday. It seems to me that Arab Effendi has not returned Iis Excellency The Right Honourable Sir N. R. O'conor, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., &amp;c ., &amp;c ., &amp;c ., toto Bussoran in consequence of the Grand Vizier's orders, as Talit Pasha, from his letter to the Vali in which he speaks of the Mudir as a truant, does not appear to have 'been cognisant of tnem, I learn that Arab Effcndi stayed a month at Hassa and quarrelled with the Mute ssarif, because the latter declined to have anything to do with him and gave orders that no one was to loo him a hoiioC, and, finally returned here on his own accord. The Vali's letter of June 8th will I presume, make it clear to the Mutessarif, that no more mu dir s are to be appointed. As regards the Mudir of Wakra I am inclined to think the Mutessarif has not been carrying out his orders. It takes about ten to fifteen days, by the Turks' own computation, for a letter to reach Hassa from Bussorah, and Talib Pasha has had anple time to recall the Mudir. On the other hand the Vali may have received some private intimation from Constantinople to 'hang on' instead of w i their awing the Mudirs at once. His attitude in the matter is not rnot reassuring and lie prevaricates; and I arn unable uo ascertain the exact wording of the orders he gave. I hear from Yusuf Effendi's family, who reside here, that their relative has been dismissed by the Vali's order at the instigation of the English, and is expected here shortly.

Extract from a demi-official letter from the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, dated the 1st June 1903. The Treasurer of the Ojair Customs, who passed through yesterday on a visit to Katif, called on me yesterday. In the conversation with him I gathered that Arabi Effendi, who was appointed to Zobara, appears to have been a troublesome person and fell out with the Mutassarif of A1 Hassa, and left for Basrah by the “ Adna ” from Katif about the 10th May. I have no means of confirming this news, and I wonder whether it is true, and the reason for his departure is the right one. Such people do not draw pay until they take oyer their appointments, and it is quite possible that he was getting tired of waiting at Al Hassa and drawing no pay in the meantime made him desperate.

Sir N. 0*Conor states that he will insist on the fulfilment of this promise, but that if it is thought that Yusuf should not be allowed to remain at Wakra even for a short time, and Colonel Kemball considers that his removal under pressure exercised by a British man of war could be carried out without giving The Under Secretary of State India Office.giving rise to local difficulties, he sees no objec tion to such a course being taken.

May 1903. vly Lord:- On hearing from the British Resident at Bu- shire on the 9th. instant that Yusuf Bey had not been intercepted at Bahrein by orders from the Vali and had proceeded to and taken up his post at Wakra as Turkish Mudir I made immediate representations to the J * r ^ f Lf 11 tm I i Grand Vizier. I reminded His Highness of the repeat ed assurances given to His Majesty's Government hy mn himself and the Minister for Foreign Affairs that mudirs would not he appointed to any of the places I had mentioned on the El Katr Coast and that there v/ould be no change in the status quo. I added that if he had accepted my proposal and authorised the Vali of Basra to send orders to Yusuf through the British Resident at Bushire not to proceed to Wakra this inci dent would not have happened and the Imperial Govern- 1 Ji inent The Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &amp;c., &amp;C., &amp;c. mGovernment were tiierefore entirely responsible for what might take place. His Highness again asserted that the Porte had no knowledge of the appointments, that they had sent positive instructions to the Vali of Basra that there should he no change in the existing state of tnings, and that the mute sari f of the Mjd who resides at El Hasa and who was an intriguing and wortnless individu al was probably the originator of this trouble. He had spoken to the Sultan on the subject and he would lay the matter before the Council of Ministers to morrow and insist upon the dismissal of Talib Pasha the mutesarif of the ^ejd. His Highness concluded by begging me to feel assured tnat uhe mudir would be recalled. I will insist upon the fulfilment of this pro mise but if Colonel Kemball considers that Yusuf ought not to be allowed to remain in possession of the post of mudir even for a s'aort. time and that t'aere would te no difficulty in removing him under the pressureexoi’C-Lsed oy a British war ship I seo no ohjoction to this course provided tne operation can he speedily and successfully perfornied without giving rise to lo cal diificulties.

Abdul Karim Eifendi, the Mudir-desicn^te ftJf 0 A e ^l v aS i °? b f. ard 1 ^, to -Bahrein. I had him interviewed, and he stated that his destination had been altered. He was to have gone to Odeid but he knew what a desolate place Odeid was, and he had managed to arrange a ransfer to another place called Alayun, which I am unable to locate, °but which is, I believe, somewhere near Katif or A1 Hassa, and he was on his way to A1 Hasa to obtain orders from the Mutessarif. As regards Odeid he stated that another officer, whose name he did not know, had been appointed as Mudir. He was of Kurdish origin and was now in Basrah, and would probably come to Bahrem by the following mail. He stated that Sheikh Jasim-bin- Iham bad asked the Porte to establish administrative units at Zobara, Wakra and Odeid, and that Arabi Effendi, who had gone to Bahrein by the preceding mail steamer, was nominated to the Zobara Mudirich, and that Yusuf Be&lt;? now at A1 Hasa, was to go to Wakra. He did not know the number of soldiers to be stationed at the new posts. 2. It is, I think, very probable that Sheikh Jasim has recommended to the^Porte the establishment of these posts. The Turkish authorities have, I believe, been for some time anxious to get hold of Sheikh Jasim, and I gather that they wish to hold him responsible for the recently disturbed state of the country between Ojair and A1 Hassa. Sheikh Jasim has therefore, in order to absolve himsell from responsibility, recommended the Turks to establish posts at several points on Katr, knowing that we should not view with equanimity any occupation of Zobara and Odeid, and wishing to embroil the Turks with us. 3. ^ It is, in my opinion, absolutely essential for the security of the Bahrein islands that Zobara should not be occupied by the Turks. Apart from the fact that the occupation of Zobara would be viewed with the greatest concern by the Chief of Bahrein, who considers the place to be an appanage of his, and whose rights we are hound to maintain, the prestige which the Turks would gain throughout the countryside by the occupation of this place, in opposition to the well-known views of the British Government, would be so great that an attack on Bahrein from Katr could at any time be organised, and the continual presence of a ship of war in Bahrein waters, and perhaps even a military occupation of the islands, would be required. Regard ing the occupation by the Turks of other places on El Katr it is not, I think, necessary for me at the present time to add anything to what has already been said on the subject.

On 21st, Yusuf Aliy Mudir designate for Wakra, arrived from El Hassa at Bahrein and intends leaving, which probably he will not be able to do for some days, to take up his post at Wakra. I would suggest that Forte should send orders to countermand his appointment, and should not send them through the Vali of Busra or through the Mutesarif at El Hassa, that course involving g7'eat delay, but personally to Yusuf Ali at Bahrein. If he establishes himself at Wakra, it will be difficult to remove him ; it is therefore imperative that suggested orders should be sent at once. There should be ample time for orders to reach him from Constantinople, as I have told Gaskin to try to arrange difficulties in the way of his obtaining his passage to Wakra, so that he will probably have to remain for the present at Bahrein. Wakra was recently visited by H.M.S. ‘ Sphinx,’ which found Turkish flag flying there, but no Turkish officials or soldiers. The Chief of Katr has, I understand, flown the Turkish flag at Wakra for some years, but the appointment of a Mudir is none the less objectionable.” We trust that Forte may be pressed to issue the proposed orders. Meanwhile, Colonel Kemball has been asked to report how Turkish flag has been flown at Wakra. ^ t. ^.. 4. ^ opy. CONSTANTINOPLE April 4th, 1903.

March 23rd 1903. ®'vly Lord, With reference to my tel No 51 of j^e I9th inst I havet the honour to report to Y.L. that Mr Block informed the M.P.A. ' that the attention of H.M.Govt had been called to a paragraph in the Ikdam of the 27th Nov last stafng that certain administrative changes and the appointment of Mudiis at Zohara , Wakra and El Odeid were in contempla tion and that he was instructed by me under orders from Y.L* to warn the Porte against any changes or disturbances of the status quo in those regions and to remind the Sublime Porte of t ne representatio ms and declarations wnich ~aa been made by the Embassy on the same subject since 1883'. In the course of conversation with the Minister Mr Block pointed out the strong objections of H.M.Govt to any interference on tnepart of Turkey in those pa ts and the danger of provoking by taking steps such as were indi cated in thelkdam an angry question with H.M.Govt. He fouad also an opportunity of acquainting the Minister of the visif* of a Russian ship of War to Koweit and the offer of aims etc m&amp;de to the Sheikh v§/hich seemed to impress H.E. a good deal. The Mini&amp; er who seemed anly imperfectly acquainted with the subject of ElKatr said that he i?ad not heard anything of the appointment of Mudirs to those places but that lie believed they had Mudirs there alreadyend he und4er the impression that Turkish sovereignty extended N fromirom the Muscat coast. ^ Mr Block expliained that he was altogether an eWous impression in this respect and that H.M.Govt had conven tions with the Tmicial Chiefs much more to the North than Muscat. H.E.was not however inclined to dis cuss the subject but he requested Mr Block to describe to his Secretary the exact representation's he had been in structed to make and promised to lay the matter at once before the Grand Vizier. On the 22nd inst Mr Block saw both the M.P.A and the Grand Vizierand learnt from H.H. th&amp;fc the statement in the Ikdam was erroneous and that the Porte did net contemplate xa aking any administrative changes or appointments in thoet regions.H.H. added however that he had applied to th/e jpni&amp;ier of th.3 Interior for fuller infomation and that &amp; A. submitting the question to the Council of MinisteB that day. I called upon Tewfik Pasha this afternoon at the Court and inquired whethre the matter had beeen considered by t the Council of Mini&amp;-&amp;rs yesterday and what decision had been come to. Prom my Tel No 55 of todays date y.L. has already learnt the Minister’s delaration to the effect that the Imperial Govt have no intention of appointing ZMudirs to Zobara Wakra and El Odeid and would not do so .1 told H.E. that it was very important Y.L# should he quite ac curately informed on tls subject and that I wished therefe fore to know whether he authorised me to report thd, the Imperial Govt would not send Mudirs to the places I had mentioned on the Katr Coast. TewKik Pasha replied that he had received his infoimation direct from the Grand Vizier and—* m&amp;rn and that he therefore authorised me toSi in the same sense to Y.L. Noov/ithstanding these stafenents I have veru little doubt that the Imperial Govt did contemplate sending Ad ministrative Crff^re officers to El Katr and that their plans are much disconcerted by the indiscreet disclosures of the Ikdam which have placed them in seriods emba^assn* ment. The representations we haveiy now made will probably suifice to deter them at all events at present from pro ceeding further in the matter and the presence of a British Man o4 wtr in those waters will probably be a stil stronger reason for not going back on the assurances now given* It would seem advisable however for H.M.

A further telegram dated zznd has now been received from him, as follows: „ ' Yesterday British Consul at Basra telegraphed that on the previous day the Turkish gunboat had left that place for Eatr. Senior Naval Officer has been informed. I think it most probable that Turkish officials designated for Eatr posts will get their orders and escort from El Rasa and then proceed by land, the gunboat being probably bound for El Bidaa, possibly with the intention of subsequently assisting in the occupation of Zobara and other places As 1 have just heard that she is still anchored at Fao, it may be possible to obtain information as to her destination from the Turkish Government. I think that pending a settlement of the questions British ship of war should be stationed at Bahrein with orders that if information is received of the occupation by the Turks of any of the places in question, she should go there and enforce its abandonment, and, if necessary, bring the Turkish officials to Bahrein. I presume that orders refer to the three places named on Eatr. r If you approve, the instructions proposed by Colonel Kemball, in respect of Zobara, Odeid, and Wakra,will be issued on arrival of (t Berseus” at Atuscat, whither we are arranging for her to proceed. ill if 5 ff* 'm u f c 1 r /13&gt;(?3 h'- 1 13 rx-y &lt;&gt; Confidential. *UM MAK^U: vO.\ a3i3.

Sir N. O’Conor to the Marquess of Lansdoivne.—[Received March 20.) (No. 135.) My Lord, Constantinople, March 14, 1903. SINCE the receipt of your Lordship’s despatch No. 54 of the 20th ultimo I have learnt from Mr. Wratislaw, in answer to my inquiries, that Mudirs, or Sub-Governors, have been sent to Zobara, Odeid, Wakra, and Amair, or Abu Ali Island. This information is partly confirmed by your Lordship’s telegram No. 53 of yesterday, which, moreover, authorizes me to make a communication to the Sublime Porte in the sense of the instructions contained in your above-mentioned despatch. I trust 1 shall have your Lordship’s approval in refraining from raising a fresh contentious discussion on the eve of a Ministerial Council, which there is reason to expect will come to a favourable decision in regard to the Aden frontier; and also in confining my representations for the moment, and until your Lordship has received this despatch and considered the remarks which I feel bound to offer, to warning the Sublime Porte against any administrative or other measures affecting the status quo. The question of Turkish sovereignty over the hi Kabi promontory has, as your Lordship is aware and will see from the accompanying Memorandum, been repeatedly the subject of discussion with the Porte, and I am not without hope of succeeding in dissuading them from proceeding with the appointments of Sub-Governors, on the ground that any disturbance of the status quo is impolitic, without having to do more than to remind them of the declarations made by His Majesty’s Government on this subject on previous occasions. I confess I see strong objections to basing our representations on the fact that we do not recognize Turkish sovereignty over this coast, as its immediate result will be to provoke the Ottoman Government to reassert, in the most formal and official manner, their claim, as happened in 1891-92 (see Memorandum) ; and if we allow their pieten- sions to pass with nothing more than a verbal or WTitten contradiction, we shall lather have weakened than strengthened our present position. If, on the other hand, we are not satisfied with merely disclaiming their pretended rights, and the Poite persist in their intentions, we shall be forced to take some definite action which may lead His Majesty’s Government further than they intend, or further than it is necessary or politic to go at present. Ac any rate, before taking a step which may raise a very vexed and complicated question, it will, I venture to think, obviously be advisable to decide befoie- hand whether His Majesty’s Government will forcibly prevent the Ottoman Government from establishing anv new outward symbols of Turkish sovereignty along the whole west coast of the Persian*Gulf to El Katif, and, if so, what will be their policy and action m regard to the Turkish military station at El Bidaa, which undoubtedly exists and has existed for many years. . , , u • It may safely be said that at the present moment Ottoman sovereignty over the whole of Arabia is, at the best, a very slender one, and that, in the gradual process of disintegration, which is proceeding pretty rapidly, it will become less and less. s it, under these circumstances, in accordance with British interests to hasten this disiuption, or even to over-weaken Turkish rule until we have some other put in its place ? It may be that, in the present instance, His Majesty’s Government is prepared, atter the death of the ruling Chief of Katr, to recognize his brother, Ahmed-bm-Iham, amt profit by his friendly disposition to conclude with him some Agreement on the lines of those with the Trucial Chiefs, which, will give us a sort of Protectorate or lien over the promontory ; but until this day arrives it is not clear to me that we gam anything by formally raising, without absolute necessity, the question of Iurkish-sovereignty, such as it is I do, however, think it very possible that, by doing so, and by overtly pursuing a policy which, rightly or wrongly, is considered as directed against the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, we encourage another Power to some act of rank aggression which will precipitate developments, and possibly place us before very long in a serious and grave predicament. t , „ t o - c i There is no doubt that our action m regard to Ivoweit has made a very painful impression upon not only the Sultan, but upon many of his Anglophil subjects, whose [1863 u—l]2 r eign Office, 173, May 11, 3.

Besides these few remarks which I have made bold to lay before your Lordship, 1 beg leave to say that I find some difficulty in clearly understanding the policy proposed by the Government of India in regard to El Odeid. On the one hand, it is suggested that our warning to the Porte should be based on the fact that we consider El Odeid as an appanage of the Chief of Abu Dhabi, an independent Ruler with whom we have Treaty relations—that is to say, that we consider El Odeid as independent of the Chief ofKatr; while, on the other hand, we appear to be contemplating the contingency of counteracting Turkish designs in El Katr by countenancing the absorption of El Odeid by Ahmed-bin-Thani. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R. O’CONOR. In closure in No. 1. Memorandum by Mr. Blech. THE Turks claim the Katr coast as part of the Nejd, to which in 1871 they sent a military expedition to assimilate it to the other provinces of the Empire. We have never admitted the validity of this claim, and we have treated misbehaviour on the part of the local Chiefs without much regard to Turkish pretensions, though the Turks have, at the invitation or with the connivance of those Chiefs, established small military posts at Ojeir, Zohara, and El Bidaa. It does not appear that any remon strance was addressed to the Turkish Government against the establishment of the post at El Bidaa, the date of which is not mentioned, but to which Colonel Talbot alludes in his No. 76 of the 7th May, 1893, as having existed, though unrecognized, for twenty years or so. In 1881 British naval officers were instructed not to allow themselves for the future to be too much hampered by the 3-mile limit in pursuing and capturing pirates, especially as the Turkish authority on the coast is at many points of a very shadowy description. The Porte was informed that as our remonstrances against unrestrained piracy in Turkish waters had produced no result, the British naval officers in the Persian Gulf would be authorized, when necessary, to take such measures as they may think fit for the protection of British commerce without reference to the claims of the Sultan to territorial jurisdiction in those waters. In reply to a complaint respecting the action of British Consular authorities in regard to the Chief of El Bidaa, Lord Granville stated to the Turkish Ambassador on the 7th May, 1883 : “ I beg leave to remind your Excellency that the claim of the Porte to rights of sovereignty over the Katr coast has never been admitted by Her Majesty’s Government.” In 1889 Her Majesty s Embassy represented to the then Grand Yizier the various considerations which made it very desirable for the Turkish Government not to extend its military action south of Katif. Whether in respect of these considerations or for other reasons the Turks apparently took no action. Under instructions from Her Majesty’s Government, Her Majesty’s Embassy asked the Sublime Porte to inform it as to the truth of a report which had reached Her Majesty’s Government, to the effect that the Imperial Ottoman Government intend to establish posts at Zobara and Odeid on the Katr coast, and that Mudirs have been appointed thereto. No reply having been received, a further inquiry is made. Her Majesty’s Government could not acquiesce in the occupation by Turkey of a port which is regarded by them as a dependency of Ahou Dthabi, the Chief of which is one of the parties to the Maritime Truce. • Zohara and Odeid are within the Vilayet of Bussorah, and have long since been administered by Kaimakams and Mudirs. The Imperial Government has no knowledge of the Maritime Truce, and cannot recognize it. Transmits a copy of the Maritime Truce, signed by the Chiefs of Raz-ul-Khaima, Ahou Dthabi, Debay, Ejman, and Umalgawin. Odeid being a dependency of Abou Dthabi, the Chief of Avhich is a party to the Maritime Truce, Her Majesty’s Govern ment cannot acquiesce in a Turkish occupation of that port.Zobara :ams and and arG ^ ie * Vila y et Bnssorah, and long administered by Mudirs. Ihe British Besident could not be ignorant of the fact Kairmh thaf^v sovereignty of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan extended over the countries m question, and he should have abstained from exercising the role of mediator between the Arab Sheikhs without the previous assent of the Porte. In any case, the Ottoman Government having been left in ignorance of this act, it can have no influence on its sovereign rights. Moreover, it is merely an armistice between Sheikhs, and could in no case be invoked against the establishment of Turkish military posts at Zobara and The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reports that there are no Turkish troops at Zobara, and that Odeid is unoccupied. Reports are prevalent that the Turks intend to send troops to Katr to attack Jasim. The Resident suggests that he would be justified in preventing the Turks from occupying either Zobara or Odeid, and compelling their evacuation if suddenly seized. He has been instructed in reply by Lord Lansdowne to report any movements of the Turks on Zobara or Odeid, but to take no measures of forcible opposition without orders. In 1893 the question of the Katr coast came to the fore, and the Porte informed Sir C. Lord that the Sultan contemplated sending troops to the Katr coast as a dependency of the Nejd. His Majesty’s Government instructed the Resident in the Persian Gulf to proceed in a ship of war to inquire into the disturbance. The Turkish Government deprecated the dispatch of a British ship, and stated that the place formed an integral part of the Ottoman dominions ; a telegram was communicated by them from the Governor and inhabitants of Katr, acknowledging the Sultan’s sovereignty. Colonel Talbot, who did proceed to El Bidaa, recommended that an effort should be made to procure the withdrawal of the Turks from the Katr peninsula. A proposal was made to negotiate with the Sultan to resign his supposed rights over the Katr peninsula to Jasim and Ahmed his brother, hut Lord Rosebery thought that nothing would come of it. Lord Kimberley subsequently proposed that Her Majesty’s Government should continue the policy laid down in 1883 of denying Turkish jurisdiction over El Katr. Lord Rosebery assented, but did not think it necessary to make any official communi cation on the subject to the Turkish Government unless they raised the question officially. Rustem Pasha was reminded unofficially of Lord Granville’s Declaration of the 7th May, 1883. (See above. Minute on India Office 10th August, 1893, in Confidential Paper 6410.) The Government of India have directed that the Commandant and Senior Naval Officer may be informed that His Majesty’s ships are not to recognize Turkish rule at El Bidaa, but that British Naval officers should avoid giving Turkish officials any opportunity of asserting by overt action such nominal authority as the Porte possesses in that locality, and to this end His Majesty’s ships should refrain from visiting the harbour of El'Bidaa except when special occasion for doing so arises. The India Office drew attention to the discrepancy in the suggestion contained in the Foreign Office letter to the India Office of the 26th August, 1893, of recognizing the nominal suzerainty of the Porte at El Bidaa so long as the Turkish authorities do not move bevond the limits of the town. It was pointed out that this was incom patible with the instructions of the Government of India that Her Majesty’s ships should not recognize Turkish rule at El Bidaa. In reply, the Foreign Office concurred in the instruction to the Naval Commander. A complaint being made by the “Nakhoda” (master) of a British boat against the Turkish Commander at El Bidaa, the Government of India instructed the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to take no further action in the matter, as the result of pursuing it further would probably have been to elicit from the Commandant’s superiors an assertion of the Porte’s jurisdiction at El Bidaa.

In 1879 lord C rant rook expressed the view that 'provide no Obstacles are interposed to any operations •which may be necessary to preserve the Peace of the seas •ana to punish marauders, and that no interference is 'attampted either with Bahrein or the Trucial Chiefs from •Odeid to Ras el Khymah, or with Muscat” no exception need • be taken to the proceedings of the Tuifcs at any point of the coast north of Odeid* The result of correspondence with the foreign Office was the issue of two sets of instr uctions. Pi rst, Sir II.Layard was instructed to propose to the Porte an arrangement, whereby H.y.cruisers should oe authorised to pursue and capture pirates witliin the 3 mile limit off the Arabian Coast North of O&amp;eid. Second, Sir H.Layard was infomed that it was useless to attempt an explicit settlement of the question, in view of the exagger ated claims to sovereignty which the Porte is always prepared to advance; but that Hts Majesty^ Govenrtcjnt held a decided view that W wherever the Tuifcish sovereignty is at •the present time fimly established upon the coast, they •are ready to recognise it, and would gladly see it •accompanied by a regular and civilized administration.• In short, the objection was not to Turicish rule to the north of'&amp;Mfed, but to anarchy. The substf.nce of the first set of instructions was conveyed to the Porte by Mr.Goschen in his Note of the 7th July 1880. The Tiuftish Government replied 8 February 1881 that they were informed that no such tiling as piracy existed in the Persian Gulf; that nevertheless a vessel of war had been sent to the Kejd coast as a precaiitionary measure and that in the circum stances there was no occasion for the proposed arrangement.The final result was that British naval officers were Given a certain liberty of action in regard to the Arab coast, (F.O. to Admiralty dated 11 July 1881). In 1881 trouble arose with Sheikh Jasiia of El Bidaa, Chief of El Katr. There has been a Turkish garilson (350 non) at El Bidaa since 1872. (The position of the Tux&amp;s at El Bidaa f *Qn our point of view is thus described in the ^.O. letter of 2d August 1893 - tt so long as the 'Tuxfcish m thorites do not move beyond the limits of the “town, the nominal suzerainty of the Porte is recognised; tt bu t any a 11 emp t to ext end Tu Hci sh an the ri ty i s r esi s t ed*). Sheikh Jasim who is still the de jure » if Sheikh Almad is the de facto , ruler of El Katr, formerly (3 May 1881) regarded himself^belng Am Wahabi^ as a Turkish subject on land, adding “the seas and what is connected with it are tmder the British Govemment tt . In point of fact, his father had entered into an agreement Y/ith Colonel Felly in 1868, binding himself “on no pretence whatsoever at emy time to “put to sea with ho a tile intentions® and invariably to refer disputes to the Resident. Some doubt, however, existed as to whether this agre^nent was not personal to Sheikh Jasim 1 k father; and, though Sheikh Jasim, on being informed that he would be held responsible to the British Government for his conduct, expressed a desire to renew it, the Government of India considered it undesirable owing to his relations with the Turks (28 April 1882). Irritated pi^bably at this rejection of his overtures, the Sheikh, who had previously under pressure from the Resident given up a maritime expedition he had contemplated against Kutif, proceeded to illtreat British Indian merchants resident at El Bidaa: and itltimately the Resident had to proceed to the , spotspot With two ships Of war. ^rtunat^y, th , sheikh then eano to tarns, so that possibla collision with the Turkish garrison was averted. The Porte protested: and was infonaed that H.M.GovsmaaKt had nev r admitted the claim to Turkish sovoroignty over El Katr. In 1893 Sir Clare Eord informed the Porte that i T .. .Government, while admitting that the sovereignty of the Sultan extended from Bus so rah to Kutif, considered that the coast soxith of that place was H debateable lrnd», and the Govenrnent o ’ India were instructed that K.K.Oovemment continue to deny the cl dms of the Tiuicish Governmtiit to exercise save reignty over El Katr peninsula: that Turkish pretensions nee4 not interfere with our liberty of action, or prev-ait our making such treaties with El Katr Chiefs as might be considered desirable. (Ko.35, dated 8 Sept.1893). In 1894 the Turkish Mutessarlf of El Hasa went to 3obara, and, in concert with Sheikh Jasin took stepS!to tom a settlenenfc of Bahreinese malcontents at that place under the Turk!This step was regarded by the yy^utx^ Bidtish Govemient as a 4»eginure to Bahrein, and, an Ineffectual protest having besn made to the Porte, H.tl.S. 'Sphinx* proceeded to the spot and took forcible measures. The Porte^pJX)tested; and Lord Salisbury one- more declined to recognise Turkish jurisdiction over El Katr (August 1895 and December 1896). At this time Sheikh Jasim announced that h«JWf' i*esigned his position as Turkish Kainakam of El Katr. It appears, however, that the Turks regarded him or Ms brother Ahmad as nominal R aimak am as recently as 1899; and that they had also in Si Katr an Assistant Kaimakam, who was practically their w Resid nt'. (1663/1900) Subsequently (1398) his rel tions with the Turks became much strained owing to their support of Koweit, which had raided a tribe professing allegiance to Sheikh Jasim, LastJl&amp;tJtts 1 Pf£. |&gt; s i i ,, W’ 1 ' i»7&lt;j /O P 7 ^ 3ia8t year, the Ck&gt;vei^«neyit of India proposed to mafce ft Protectorate Treaty with Ahmad bin Than!, who is described as the d? facto ruler. Sheikh Jasim being now superannuated* in reply the Government of India were instructed not to allow the Resident to do more that make preliminary enquiries or to commit the Indian Government to any obligations p^ding the result of further discussion* (Ho.37, dated 5 September 1902.) Then otm* from Constantinople a report that the Turkish Government proposed sending garrisons to Certain places on the Arabian coast, including Q&amp;eid and Zob&amp;ra. Tlie Govemnant of In&lt;lia propose that we should prevent the occupation of Zobara and Oddd, on the saone grounds as in 1895 viss. on the ground that it would be a menace to Bahrein. They also renew their suggestion about an agreement with Ahmad bin Thani, but do not press it. The position at Zobara was held so recently as 1896 to be sufficiently important to Bahrein to justify Its in forcibly turning out the settl ^nent fostered there by the Tusk s* A s to O&amp;sid, its status was determined by thQ Goveiument of India in their despatch No. 127 of 1879. »0&amp;ei&amp; belongs to •the Chief of Ahoothabee, with whom the- British Government •has m^iintfiined direct tr^ity relations formally years, and •that the pretensions of Turkey to claim the settlement as •a dependency of a Turkish district are vague and without •foundation. It may be true that Sheikh Batay ®f Odoid has •occasionally hoisted the Turkish flag, that he has claimed •Turkish protection, find that he has latterly paid a small •tribute to El Bidaa. But the existence oi a separate cJi ^ •independent Chiefship at Odeid has never been recognised, •and the act of Sheikh Butay in establishing a settlement •there was an infraction of the prescriptive territorial •rights of Aboothabee. The declaration of the Odeld Sheikli, •and of hie colony, that they put themselves unde*’ Torkisn protection•protection, would not in any way, of itself. Justify the •Tuyfcs in asserting their Jurisdiction ower the place. M If such a plcfl were adrdtted, it would be set up by every •petty Chief along the coast who night have good reasons for •desiring to evade control or chastisement. tt There seems, therefore, to be nothing in our previous dealings with the Turks inconsistent with our Tight to protest against an occupation of Zobara,,whilst w© have over and over again refused to admit their claim to interfere with the Truci&amp;l Chiefs, and therefore with Odeid. The TuHdsh Ambassador in 1893 asked for the text of our treaties with the Trucial Chiefs, and we consented. Presumably, therefore, th &gt; Turkish Government are quits aware of the limits which we claim for our own.Departments are reqvestcd, if they suspect that there is any mistake in this telegram, to ccmmunicate immediately with the Private Secretary to the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State. COPY OF TELEGRAM FROM t/.; € r HT~e 11 ^ | l Dated Keceiyed at London Office 1*1 0*5 (pix~ . From Viceroy, \Qth January 1903. P. —FI Katr. In continuation of my telegram of \0th instant. Kemball, with whose opinion I concur, considers it necessary in view of our relations with Bahrein and Abu Uthabi to prevent the Turks occupying Zobara and Odeid. As to former place, see letter from Foreign Office to India Office, of Fist November 1896, enclosmg draft Note to Turkish Ambassador. Latter place is regarded as appanage of Abu Uthabi. From India Office letter to Foreign Office, dated 2%th March 1893, I understand that the text of our agreement o/*1892 with the Trucial Chiefs was communicated to the Fo?'te. Kemball cannot identify Dikre. With regard to Amair island, which is north of Katif , roe are not concerned with its occupation by the Turks. Their occu pation of Zobara and FI Odeid would deal serious blow to our whole position in the Gtdf and would gravely compromise the states of Bahrein, and I sincerely trust that it will be prevented by His Majesty's Government. With reference to your Despatch of 5th September last, No. 37, Sheikh Jassim-bin- thani is reported by Kemball to be the recognised Chief of Katr. He is styled Kaimakan by the Turks, but he repudiates the title. His brother, Ahmed-bin-thani, is however the de facto Chief and is regarded as heir to Sheikh Jassim, who is over eighty years of age. In November 1899 Ahmed approached Colonel Meade on the subject of British protection and asked for permission to occupy Odeid. I think it will be wise to enter into an agree ment with him in order to prevent Turkish designs, but should His Majesty's Government not be prepared to take this step at once, which will perhaps depend on attitude of the Turks, he might be told that we prefer to wait until he succeeds to the chief ship on the demise of his brother.

Her Majesty’s Embassy regrets that it is not possible to comply with the requests of the Sublime Porte in the matter. It will be in the recollection of the Imperial Government that, on the 10th December 1871, Server Pasha, then Minister for Eoreign Affairs, formally assured Count Pisani, Dragoman of Her Majesty’s Embassy, that the Sublime Porte entertained not the least intention to attack or obtain any supremacy over the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf. Bahrein being now under the protection of Her Majesty the Queen of England, Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Eoreign Affairs has instructed the Embassy to inform, the Imperial Government that no interference by the Ottoman authorities with natives of that island can be admitted.

They have accordingly to request that immediate instructions be sent to the Vali of Bussorah to recognise the right of Her Majesty’s Consul to intervene in cases in which natives of Bahrein are concerned.

Her Majesty’s Embassy have now received further details respecting the case of a Bahreinese subject to whom allusion was made in their Note Yerbale, No. 16, of 8th February. Abdul Aziz bin Ali, a subject of the Sheikh of Bahrein, and con sequently under the protection of Her Britannic Majesty, has preferred a complaint to Her Majesty’s Consul at Busrah, stating that a Koweit baghla in which he was a passenger was, on the night of 1st December, stopped by a boat containing seven men at a place between Abunghua and Sibiliat on the Shat ul Arab. The occupants of the boat, who stated that they were employes of the Begie Department, and who were all armed, boarded the baghla and compelled the crew and passengers to deliver up all their valuables. Three hundred dollars and 400 rupees in cash and some clothes were taken from Abdul Aziz. The correspondence which ensued on the subject between Her Majesty’s Consul and His Excellency the Yali has already been brought to the notice of the Sublime Porte in the above-mentioned Note Yerbale. Her Majesty’s Embassy have now the honour to request that instructions may be sent to the Yali to comply with the desire of Her Majesty’s Consul that effectual measures may be taken in order to obtain the restitution of the stolen property, failing which Her Majesty’s Embassy trust that adequate compensation may be granted to the aforesaid Abdul Aziz bin Ali.

Majesty’s Government a copy of a letter* (Enclosure No. 4 .) from our Political Resident m the Persian Gulf regarding the wish of Sheikh Ahmed-hin-Thani, who appears to be now the principal Chief in El Katr, to he taken under British protection. He undertakes in this case to reside at any place in El Katr that we may approve, to hold himself responsible for keeping the adjacent waters free from pirates, and to co-operate with our officers and with the Chief of Bahrein m any matters ^ of common interest on the mainland. Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball, m c - municating the Sheikh’s message, expresses the opinion ^“ent of the nature indicated may he expected to produce most satisfactory results. VVe entirely concur in this view. 2. As Your Lordship is aware, the Turks have maintained a garrison at El Bidaa on the El Katr coast for over 30 years.

Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gult, To—-The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to invite a reference to your telegram, dated 4th Febru ary, m which you refer to my letter No. 12, dated 18th January, regarding the arrival m Bahrein of Saad-ul-Hazemi, the commissary of the Amir of Neid with letters from that Chieftain and the Wali of Bussorah addressed to Sheikh Jasim bin Tham of Katr. I regret to say that it has not been found possible to procure copies of the letters entrusted to the commissery. Sheikh Jasim lives in the interior of Katr and cannot easily be approached, nor is it at all likely that he could be induced to show the letters whicli he has received. It would be possible to arrange an interview with his brother Sheikh Ahmad at El Wakra, hut I am doubtful if such an interview would be productive of the desired result, as Sheikh Ahmad does not usually concern himself with matters outside Katr and is left to deal with the local Turks. Moreover, a visit to El Wakra might be incon venient, as the Turks are at El Bidaa which is only 8 miles distant and a Turkish officer would probably be present at the interview. 3. I submit a copy of a further report * to me from the Assistant Political * No. 33 , dated 23 rd February 1902 . Agent at Bahrein on the subject of the movements of Saad-ul-Hazemi. There is, I believe, little doubt that his deputation was connected with the desire of the Amir of Nejd to win over to his side the tribes residing on the borders of Nejd, and the letter addressed by the Wali of Bussorah to Shaikh Jasim was, I think, intended to give strength to the Amir’s representations on the subject. It would he possible to arrange that Sheikh Ahmad should be interviewed at some other place in Katr, say, at Zobara, where an interview could he held without interference; but I am doubtful as to the advisability of this course, more specially as I believe that the object of the commissary’s visit and the extent to which the Turks are concerned in the mission are sufficiently known. 4. I have lately received information that the Turks intend to reinforce f She left on 6th instant with 320 soldiers and theil gctrilSOnS at Katif and El fiasSB, two small guns on board. ^ and that the Turkish gun-boat Zohaf^ c. a. k. was to leave Bussorah immediately for Katif with troops on hoard, whilst a squadron of cavalry had already left Busso rah by land, presumably for El Hassa. These movements are presumably on account of the disturbed state of the interior and are intended to restrain the tribes from throwing in their lot with Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Rahman bin Eeysal, whose recent success at Riadh would appear to be, as Mr. Gaskin says, contrary to the interests of the Turks. I have instructed Mr. Gaskin to keep a careful watch on the possible further movements of the Turks in the direction of Katr. No. 33, dated Bahrein, the 2‘3rd February 1902. From—J. C. Gaskint, Esq., Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your confidential letter No. 104, dated the 13th February 1902, on the subject of the commissary, named Saad-ul-Hazemi, sent by the Amir of Nejd to Katr.16 I regret to report that it is not possible to procure copies of the letters entrusted to the commissary by the Amir and Wali of Bussorah to Sheikh Jassim bin Thani, who resides in the interior of Katr and consequently cannot he approached. Saad-ul-Hazemi was entertained by Haji Mukbil-ul-Thakair before his departure for Katr, and the information reported in my letter No. 7, dated the 13th January 1902, was obtained from that source as well as the Chief of Bahrein. Further confidential reports have been received to the effect that the commissary on behalf of the Amir asked Sheikh Jassim to take measures towards expelling Abdul Aziz Shin Abdul Rahman bin Faisal from the environs of El Hassa, and before he gave a definite reply the news of the taking of Riadh reached them, when Sheikh Jassim was able to state that under the circum stances his help was unnecessary. It appears also that Sheikh Jassim discouraged the idea of making overtures to the tribes in Katr, and the com missary’s endeavours in that direction seems to have met with no success. Sheikh Jassim is a Wahabi of the same creed as Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman, and while professing friendship with the Amir of Nejd, he is at heart with Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman. Though Sheikh Jassim could have furnished ample escort to take Saad-ul- Hazemi to El Hassa, he dissuaded him from going direct on the ground of the insecurity of the route and consequently he returned to Bahrein on the 3 rd instant. * With a;view to delude the adherents of Abdur Rahman bin Faisal and the Sheikh of Koweit, who may have entertained the intention of way laying him on the way to Ojair, he gave out that he intended to proceed to Bussorah by the S. S. Crescent which was at anchor in the harbour at the time, and subsequently left secretly on the 6th instant in the evening with Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab of Darein, who had ordered forty of his followers to proceed in advance to Ojair for their escort to El Hassa, Finding the road between Ojair and El Hassa infested with marauding Bedouins, they applied to El Hassa for reinforcements, on the arrival of which they continued their journey. It is stated that Saad-ul-Hazemi took up his quarters at a suburb, but the inhabitants fearing that some morning he might be found murdered by adherents of the Saud family, and of which tney may he accusedj refused to have in their midst and he had to remove into the fort of El Hassa. The general opinion in Bahrein is that his going to El Hassa is for the purpose of gaining over the tribes on the border of Nejd to the interest of the Amir, and to watch the movements of Abdur Rahman bin Faisal, and keep the Amir informed of what may be going on in the district. 1 have to-day received a confidential report as emanating from Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab to the efiect that the Turks have entrusted the entire control of all the Arab tribes in Nejd, Koweit, El Hassa and Katr districts to the Amir and have given him a free hand to organize within those regions expeditions against refractory tribes, and the Turkish officials in El Hassa and Katr are to give him their support and have no authority beyond the walls of the towns in which they reside. This arrangement has been adopted with a view to strengthen the hands of the Amir, as well as to ensure the security of the roads and Saad-ul-Hazemi has been nominated by the Amir for the above purpose to reside in El Hassa. It is difficult to obtain direct evidence as regards the extent to which the Turks are concerned in the mission of Saad-ul-Hazemi. The information which reaches me is second-hand and consequently not always reliable; and if our Government desire to obtain definite information, it will be necessary to secure an astute and reliable person to proceed to El Hassa for the purpose of watch ing the commissary and the Turks. It is, however, well known that he carried letters from the Wali of Bussorah for Sheikh Jassim and the Mutassarif of A1 Hassa, and from this fact it may be safely concluded that the mission has the approbation of the Turks. Abdul Aziz’s recent success at Riadh is an element of danger to the Turks, and if he is left unmolested by the Amir of Nejd for any length of time the chances are great that he will succeed to win over a considerable force from the tribes in southern Nejd, in which case he may be able to hold his own against the Amir; and Abdul Aziz once established in that part of his ancestors’No. 70, dated Busliire, the 31st March 1902 (Confidential).

From— J. C. Gaskin, Esq., Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, To— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your confidential letter No. 173, dated the 7th March 1902, and to report that the Turkish corvette “ Zuhaf ” reached Ras Tanura on Monday, the 10th instant. Authentic information has been received that the vessel has brought about 350 Turkish infantry and two small guns from Basrah. The troops and guns were landed at Anich, a dilapidated fort about two miles south of Katif. One hundred of the infantry have been sent to form a garrision at Ojair, and the two guns were despatched to El Hassa. Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab Pasha, who accompanied Saad-al-Hazemi to El Hassa, returned to Bahrein on the 9th instant. He called at the Agency subsequent to his return, and amongst other information I learnt from him that Yakub Beg, the ex-Kaimakam of Katif, wrote to the Government, as far back as December, regarding the advisability of having a small guard at either of the islands of Musalamiya or Janna, some 68 miles to the north of Katif and the Motasarif of El Hassa has been instructed by the Minister of the Interior through the Vali of Basrah to carry out the suggestion and arrange for a guard of 25 soldiers there. These two islands are small, about a square mile each, and are situated in a shallow bay and connected by fords with the mainland. They are inhabited by the Amair tribe, and in recent years have become important owing to the nomad tribes in Aden and adjacent territory, making them a market for the sale of clarified butter and other produce!U1 Kecently a fight took place between two factions of the Amairs and some blood was shed on each side. This occurrence will afford the Turks sufficient excuse for placing a guard in the islands. Sheikh Muhammad also stated that the reinforcements made to the Katif _ and Ojair garrisons are due to repeated petitions submitted by the residents of * Katif to the Porte, asking for an increase in the garrisons as a safeguard against Bedouin incursions, and to the Turks fearing His Majesty’s Government entertain sinister designs against their territories in those regions.

In continuation of this office confidential letter No. 55, dated the 22nd March 1902, I have the honour to report that a confidential Agent, who returned from Katr on the 27th instant, informs me that the Commandant of the Turkish garrison at El Bidaa stated, at a gathering at which he was present, that the Turkish authorities intend to increase the garrison there shortly. My informant further states that the Commandant’s appeals at Basrah and El Hasa for funds for the pay and rations of the troops in his charge have met with no response, and he has been obliged to take a loan of 4,000 Austrian dollars from Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani with which to appease the troops, and has, as a last resource, sent the Paymaster of the garrison to El Hasa to procure funds. Beports have been received from El Hasa to the effect that Saad-el-Hazemi, on his arrival at El Hasa, notified to the Amir of Nejd the desirability of taking into custody Muhammad-bin-Abdulla Hussein, Ibrahim- bin-Toog, Musaad-bin-Abdulmehsin-al-Swelim and Ibrahim-bin-Saif, natives of Eiadh residing in El Hasa and staunch adherents of the Saud family; and the Amir wrote to the Wali of Basrah on the subject, and the latter accordingly directed the Mutassarif to carry out Saad’s wishes. Three of the men were recently seized, and Ibrahim-bin-Saif with the aid of Ahmed-biu-Abdulla-bin- Milhim, a native of El Hasa, managed to make his escape, and was escorted safely by a party of about 16 Al Murra tribesmen to A1 Hussein, 8 miles south of Katif, whence he came to Bahrein on the 28th instant in a boat sent for him by Sheikh Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab, who was notified of his approach, and requested to make arrangements for his safe conveyance to Bahrein by Ahmed-bin-Abdulla-bin-Milhim. Ibrahim-bin-Saif states that Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdul Bahman-bin-Eaisal has received the allegiance of the whole of Southern Nejd, and the tithes of the districts have been paid over to him, and that the majority of the nomad tribes have also thrown in their lot with him, owing to the Amir having taken no step, so far, to recover Riadh which is considered to be due to weakness. At the request of Abdul Aziz the Bedouins have assassinated Abdulla-bin-lbrahim- bin-Abdul Rahman whose father was one of the officers of the Amir while he was amongst them for the purpose of buying sheep and cattle. It is generally thought that Abdul Aziz is now capable of holding his own against the Amir.4rjf| No. 93, dated Bush,'re, the 28th April 1902 (Confideutial).

I am, therefore, of opinion that, if I may be authorised to enter into an arrangement with the Chief of Katr whereby his independence is recognised and a promise of protection from interference by other Powers given to him on the condition that he is responsible for the maintenance of order in Katr and for the prevention of piracies by sea, most satisfactory results may be expected to follow. His Majesty’s Government would not, I believe, be prepared to allow the Turks to extend their authority to any other place on Katr besides El-Bida which is already occupied by them, and, indeed, any such extension of authority by the Turks would be greatly to be deplored, as disturbances both on land and sea would surely follow, experience having shown that Turkish control is never sufficiently effective to ensure the maintenance of order and to suppress piracies. Undoubtedly the best arrangement would be to obtain the consent of the Turkish Government to withdraw their garrison from El-Bida where they are in reality only on sufferance, and which cannot be of any real importance to them, but I fear that this is out of the question.

Again, the question “ eh^e o lesiCce on Karr by the Chief with whom we enter into the arrangement will have to be considered. The probability is that some other place than Zobava on the opposite coast of Katr will be found to be more suitable, on account of the proximity of the pearling banks I would, therefore ask tlv.t tMs letter may be considered merely as an ad report submitted for^the purpose 'of^informing the Government of India of the wish expressed by Sheikh Ahmed to enter mto relations with the British Governmen , and I wonld solicit the instructions of Government as to what action I should take.

In conclusion, I would beg to remark that the reference made hv Sheikh Ahmed in his message to/fr. Gaskin regarding his readiness to co-operate in matters on the mainland probably refers to the murder of Sheikh Salman-bin-Diaij, the cousin of%lie Sheikh of Bahrein and his followers. There is little doubt that, if Sheikh Ahmed were assured of our proteciion, he could arrange to bring to justice the perpetrators of this crime. r 0 No. 56, dated Bahrein, the 22nd March 1902 (Confidential). From—J. C. Gaskin, Esq., Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, To—L ieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to report that Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Muhammad Thani of Katr is anxious to come under the protection of His‘Majesty s Government. Eor the last two years he has been periodically sending me messages to the effect that he is desirous of meeting me privately, and on each occasion hinted that he wished to obtain onr protection. He recently sent a more urgent message with one named Abdur Rahman Wazzan to the effect that, it His Majesty’s Government will extend their protection to him and his follow ing he will be glad to reside at any place in Katr which the Government may think fit, that he will hold himself responsible to keep the seas round Katr free from pirates, and that he will co-operate with the Government and the Ghiet of Bahrein in any matters which may concern them on the mamiand. Sheikh Ahmed is a wealthy Chief and consequently is influential with the nomad tribes, and his influence and prestige would rapidly increase direct y it is known that he enjoys our protection. Also, any settlement in Kati un onr protection will quickly expand and draw away most of the inhabitants oi El-Bida. The piracy question is an important one, and I need hardly pomi* out the desirability of having a responsible Chief to keep the Katr coast c ear, and I am inclined to think that Sheikh Ahmed could keep the Bedoums m check in this as well as other respects. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the history of Katr to offer any definite opinion as regards the rights of the Chief of Bahrein to that district, hut I understand from the Chief that Zobara is the only place m Katr to whic he can lay claim. Should His Majesty’s Government decide to entertain Sheikh Ahmed’s proposal, I am of opinion that it may he arranged wi Chief of Bahrein to permit him to occupy Zobara on terms to be se vimutually. The occupation of Zobara by an hostile Sheikh would, of course, be a menace to Bahrein; but if a treaty of alliance is concluded by the two parties, the enforcement of which is guaranteed by the Government, no doubt all apprehension of danger will disappear, especially as I understand that some old Bahrein families who many years ago left the islands and settled near Bingah intend to return and occupy Jan which is due west of Zobara. Bringing Sheikh Ahmed under our protection at Zobara Would be an effectual step towards establishing our policy of not recognising the claims of Turkey to Katr, at the same time diminish the number of places on the main land from which Bahrein can be threatened, and draw a line across Katr to prevent Turkish encroachment towards the northern end of the peninsula. I would strongly urge the careful ^ consideration of the question now that the opportunity offers itself.^ Turkey is now turning her attention to strengthening her position in these regions, and she may go so far as to establish herself in a manner from which it may be difficult to dislodge her hereafter. i Vortign Office Press—-No. 292—21-5 •02—49.Enclosure No. 5.

In supersession of this office letter No. 104, dated 31st ultimo, I have the honour to report, for the information of the Government of India, that His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, from whom I had made enquiries, has informed me that there are not four regiments of infantry there to send to El-Hasa, and that the Wali and the Mushir are not likely to go there at this time of the year. Mr. Wratislaw further explains that what really happened was this that, after the disaster to the Ojair-Hasa caravan mentioned in this office diary entry No. 2, dated 8th May last, the Turkish authorities decided to send one battalion—about 400 men—to El-Hasa; that they wanted the Anglo-Arabian and Persian Steam Ship Company’s lightering steamer the “ Dwina ” to take the men, hut failed to come to terms, and that it is now said that the Mahsousse Company’s steamer “ Adana ”, which recently took troops from Constantinople to the Yemen, is to go to Basrah for them and will probably be accompanied by the gun-boat “ Kilid-el-Bahr ”, which was despatched from Constantinople last year for the Persian Gulf, but which has not yet come out of the Bed Sea.

Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, r ^'° The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to report that the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein has recently received a message from Sheikh Ahmed-hin-Thani, brother of Sheikh Jasim-hin-Thani of El-Katr, to the effect that, if he is taken under the protection of His Majesty’s Government, he will reside at any place in Katr approved of by the Government, and further that he will hold himself re sponsible to keep the seas round Katr free from pirates, and will co-operate with His Majesty’s Government and the Chief of Bahrein in any matters which may concern them on the mainland. Mr. Gaskin’s letter to me on the subject is forwarded herewith. 2. It is not necessary for me to discuss the status of El-Katr which is well known to the Government of India, hut I would invite a reference to the letter (Secret) No. 35, dated 8th September 1893, from Lord Kimberley to the Government of India, which was forwarded under Foreign Department endorse ment No. 2146 E., dated 12th October 1893. The policy of His Majesty’s Government with regard to the El-Katr coast is here clearly enunciated, and liberty of action prescribed in the matter of “ making such treaties with the Chiefs of El-Katr as may be considered desirable ”. 3. The Government of India will be aware that for many years past the state of affairs in El-Katr has not been satisfactory. Inland disorders and piracies at sea have been of frequent occurrence, and a constant menace exists to the peace of Bahrein, in the maintenance of which His Majesty’s Govern ment is so intimately concerned. The prosperity of Bahrein is now on the increase, and I am confident that, if some arrangement can be made whereby the tribes inhabiting El-Katr may be brought under efficient control and the adjoining seas rendered safe, the effect on the prosperity and trade of Bahrein will be beneficial. Under existing conditions, all we can do towards obtaining redress for our subjects or Bahreinis who may suffer loss by piracies, is to attach such property of the Katr Chief as we may be able to lay our hands on in Bahrein. This arrangement can never, in my opinion, be satisfactory and may not always be feasible. Boat expeditions are rarely possible in the case of piracies which occur off Katr, as it is often impossible to obtain full and satisfactory information as to whence the pirates emanate. Moreover, in many cases, it is believed that the crimes are committed by the Beni Hajirs who have no fixed place of residence and who cannot be dealt with by a boat expedition. 4. I am, therefore, of opinion that, if I may be authorised to enter into an arrangement with the Chief of Katr whereby his independence is recognised and a promise of protection from interference by other Bowers given to him, on the condition that he is responsible for the maintenance of order in Katr and for the prevention of piracies by sea, most satisfactory results may be expected to follow. His Majesty’s Government would not, I believe, be prepared to allow the Turks to extend their authority to any other place on Katr besides El-Bida which is already occupied by them, and, indeed, any such extension of authority by the Turks would be greatly to be deplored, as disturbances both on land and sea would surely follow, experience having shown that Turkish control is never sufficiently effective to ensure the maintenance of order and to suppress piracies.
