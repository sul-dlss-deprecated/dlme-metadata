The Expression of Time and Date in Signal Messages. 1 • The following rules have been agreed to by all British and American Services for the expression of times and dates in signals. They become effective on 1st April, 1943, and may be summarised as under i. The Time of Origin of all signals will be expressed as 6 figures followed by the appropriate zone suffix letter (see table at foot). The first two figures will signify the date, the second two the hours, and the third two the minutes, i.e. 1st April at 2340 hours in ’IRAQ - 01/2340/C. 12th April at 0430 hours in PERSIA - 12/0430/CD. ii. All times detailed in the text of a message are to be followed by the zone suffix letter appropriate to the locations under discussion, except that, in messages involving a large number of times a covering expression such as All times Zone C ” may be used instead of appending a zone suffix to each individual time. iii. When reference is made to a message by its Time of Origin, the method of expressing that Time of Origin will be preserved in its original form. The month and/or year may be added when necessarv e.g. “ Your 28/1513/Z April 43.” iv. The Time of Origin used in messages which cross a time zone will be G.M.T. unless considerations of security and/or expediency require otherwise. BY AIR VICE-MARSHAL H. V.

Oq this the 2Jth anniversary of its formation, I send my heartfelt congratulations to the Boyal Air Force at home and overseas. To me personally it is an anniversary of deep significance: for it was on the day of the year 1918 that I was first absorbed into the Force, and there began for me an association of which I have never been prouder than I am today. The quarter of a century which has passed since the Royal Air Force has assumed its present name, it has won and daily continues to win imperishable renown. It is not so long ago that, greatly outnumbered, it hurled back the mighty armadas launched against these islands as preliminary to invasion and our destruction. Now powerful and well armed, its Squadrons are everywhere deployed for the attack. Across the high seas in collaboration with the Royal Navy, it strikes relentlessly at hostile shipping. In proud partnership, it shared the triumphs of our Armies in the field, and in its own sphere it penetrates bv day apd night the enemy’s most formidable defences to aim crippling blows at his bases and arsenals at the nerve centres of his resistance. Fighting side by side with the gallant Air Forces of the Dominions and of our Allies, it has indeed established a clear ascendancy over our enemies. This supremacy of the air is due in part to the fighting qualities of the operational Squadrons, in part to the devoted skill of the ground stalls, both men and women: and in part to the magnificent training organisation built up throughout the Empire. But its prime cause beyond question is the spirit that which inspires each and every member of the Force, the spirit that attains the stars, however hard the way may be, it is my constant prayer that good fortune and success may ever be vouchsafed to the Royal Air Force and to all who serve in it.

All ranks of the Royal Air Force in ’Iraq and Persia thank you for your telegram of good wishes on this our 25th anniversary. We especially value your message as coming from the Polish Army, for whom we have the deepest regard. From Air Ministry. A.679. 31st March. Please circulate to all Royal Air Force Units following message dated 1st April from Chief of the Air Staff to all ranks of the Royal Air Force. Begins. Today we celebrate the 25th birthday of the Royal Air Force. Looking back over these twenty-five years, we can look with pride that the splendid traditions handed over to us in the late war by the flying services of the Army and of the Royal Navy have been safe in our keeping. Starting the present war with small numbers but with high intentions, our Service has already done great deeds. One of its first tasks was to command the air over our islands to preserve them from invasion, and the battle in which this was done will never be forgotten. Now, thanks to the help of scientists and engineers and many public servants, thanks to the efforts of the aircraft industry, thanks above all to the support of our people both here and beyond the seas who have given so many of their sons and daughters to serve in our ranks, we have forged the mighty weapon which the Royal Air Force is today. While sharing ever more closely the fortunes of the Navy and Army in the war over sea and land, our own Service is now striking with great and growing strength at the heart of the enemy. As we look forward over an ever widening horizon where fresh opportunities await us for the Service of our King and Country, let us dedicate ourselves anew to our great task, so that, in company with the Air Forces of the Dominions and of our Allies, we may play our part worthily in the winning of Victory. Ends.From Air Ministry. 31st March. Sec 692. Please circulate to all Royal Air Force Units following message to the Royal Air Force from the Secretray of State for Air. Begins. The creation of the Royal Air Force in 1918 was a revolutionary experiment in war organisation. Its makers were hopeful, the public were benevolent, and the officers and men of the new Service were determined to justify its existence. In twenty-five years of hard work and hard fighting all hopes have been fulfilled, and high purpose and determination have ripened into achievements. And in the hearts of the people benevolence has turned into deep gratitude and admiration towards the youngest of the three Services. Unflinching and disciplined devotion to duty and the spirit of daring and challenge have led you to conquest in the field, both of ideas and of arms. You have inherited proud traditions. You have enriched them. May Victory crown your heroic deeds in this war, and may peace bring you fresh opportunities of service to your country and to mankind. Ends. From H.Q., R.A.F., M E. P.482. April 1. Secret. Following message from Air Commander in Chief, Mediterranean Air Command, to all ranks. Begins. To all R.A.F. personnel in Mediterranean Air Command I send my greetings on this 25th anniversary of the birth of our Service. You have made, and are making our history, not only in battle against the enemy in the air, on land, and at sea, but also in supply, repair, and maintenance in many climes and over thousands of miles you have shown the real power of an Air Force. In this anniversary year, I am sure we will prove to the enemy and the world even more decisively the real meaning of Air Power. Ends. From M.E. Command H.Q. P.113. 31 March. Chief to all ranks. Begins. Today the R.A.F. is 25 years old. On this historic birthday I send greetings to all ranks of the Allied Air Forces in the Middle East and express my appreciation of the great page which you have written and are still writing in the history of the air. The world rings today with the epic of the battle of the Middle East as it rang before with the epic of the Battle of Britain. In the years between the R.A.F. has grown from a few gallant Squadrons into a mighty fighting force. Ere long, this force, in co-operation with our land and sea forces, and aided by your whole-hearted efforts, will accomplish the complete defeat of our enemies and the liberation of occupied Europe. Ends. To all Formations and Units of the R.A.F. in ’Iraq and Persia. From R.A.H.Q. P.546. 31 March.

AIR OFFICER COMMANDING, ROYAL AIR FORCE ’IRAQ AND PERSIA Part 1 ■ AIR STAFF. East Command Armament Staff Protection of Ammunition from Excessive 266. Protection of Ammunition from Excessive Temperatures. Attention of all Units holding S.A.A. is directed to Middle Instructions, Part 2, Section 11, Leaflet No. 21, Issue No. 1 - Temperatures.” 2. The critical temperature for S.A.A., including 20 mm. ammunition, is 130 degrees F.. and the types of ammunition particularly affected are 20 mm. (S.A.P.I. and H.E.I.), S.A.A^Incendiary and 'tracer. 3. The main provision of these instructions are reproduced hereunder for the benefit of any Units not in possession of Middle East Command Armament Staff Instructions. a. All stocks of ammunition must be kept under shade Snd not merely under cover, i.e., an airspace must be left between the cover and the ammunition. In order to protect ammunition in aircraft, the gun bays must he covered by Wing Tread Mats laid on I inch battens, to allow a free flow of air over the shaded area so found, or if these are not available, any pieces of unserviceable tentage, * M.T. covers or other material which will give the same protection may be used. b. Units not already in possession of these items should take immediate steps to demand the necessary equipment. c. All cases of spontaneous combustion or stoppages due to tight extraction resulting from high pressures must he reported immediately to this Headquarters giving lull particulars of ammunition, type, lot number, etc., and the conditions under .which the failure occurred.

Report of Accidental or Self-Inflicted Injuries on Forms 551. In cases in which it is not proposed to hold a Court of Inquiry or Formal Investigation and the relative Form d:&gt;l contains a statement to this effect, Form 551 is invariably to bear an endorsement signed by the Commanding Officer personally stating that he is satisfied that an investigation would add nothing to the information contained on Form 551. 268. Selection of Serving Airmen for Aircrew Training—A.M.O. A.373/42. It is the responsibility of a Commanding Officer when he is notified of the withdrawal for aircrew training of airmen serving under his command to ensure, on the advice of the Unit Medical Officer, that the medical categories of the airmen concerned have not deteriorated since their last Medical Board. No airman is to proceed for training until the Medical Officer has satisfied himself that he is fit to carry out the full duties of the aircrew category for which he is to undergo training. C. 2502/P.3. 2316/P.I. / /■V \ *x, 269. Appointment to Commissioned Rank : A. &amp; S. D. (Armament, Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Signals) Branch. There appears to be some confusion relative to A M.O. A. 43 /42 which concerns the appointment of airmen to commissioned rank in the A. &amp; S. 14. Branch for Armament, Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Signals duties ; in order to assist Commanding Officers the following is promulgated : 2. Appointment to commissioned rank for those duties referred to in the abovementioned A.M.O. relates to those candidates who are considered suitable in all respects and conform to the required standards issued from time to time by this Headquarters, but who do not possess the necessary technical qualifications as would merit a direct recommendation for the appropriate Technical Branch. 3. It is emphasised that the semi-technical qualifications of any airman, whom it is desired so to recommend, are to be of the highest standard having due regard to his limited experience. 4. It is to be noted however, that A.M.O. A. 430/42 has in no way lowered the general standard required but merely introduces sub-divisions of the A. &amp; S. D. Branch. C.2502/P.3. 270. Appointments to Commissioned Rank - Filter Officers. An examination of results obtained by candidates at the Middle East b’dter Training School reveals that insufficient consideration has been given to the qualifications required of potential Filter Officers, and the following extract is promulgated ior the guidance of ail Commanding Officers when interviewing candidates :- “ i Speed and Alertness. Accuracy in visual perception, good memory and capable of making rapid decisions. ii. Intelligence. A high standard of intelligence is required, since the work involves continual thinking in the sense of ‘ reasoning ’. iii. Mathematical knowledge. A good knowledge of mathematics, especially as applied to Physics and Electrical Theory, is essential. iv. Social Qualities. ^ He must be able to get the best out of his crew and work harmoniously with the Filter Officer and with airmen under his command, both in times of inactivity and times of stress. The whole efficiency of the filter room depends to a great extent on the general spirit of co-operation. v. Keenness. It is very necessary that the Filterer should be keen on his work and realise its importance in order to instil this keenness into his crew.” 2. It is desirable hut not necessary for candidates to possess a knowledge of R.D.F. or Filter and Operations Room procedure, and they should, if possible, be selected from the three following trades Clerks S.D. (O) # Clerks S.D. (F 1 R. 1&gt;.F. Trades. 3. All Station and Unit Commanders are requested to en-ure, in future, that the foregoing details are borne in mind before an airman is recommended for appointment to commissioned rank in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch for Filter Duties. C.2502/P.3. ^ 271. MICROGRAM SERVICE—OFFICIAL MAIL FOR UNITED KINGDOM. All correspondence between this command and the United Kingdom will henceforth be Microfilmed and despatched by Special Fast Air Route without reference to the originators, but with the following exceptions. i. Most Secret Documents. ii. Any correspondence deemed unsuitable. 2. The following instructions are to be observed : i. To ensure perfect reproduction at destination, care should be taken to avoid the following faults when typing correspondence. Fault - a. Use of semi transparent paper. An opaque WHITE paper should be used. Fault - b. Typed with too light a touch. Some pressure should be applied. Use a machine with large type. Fault - c. Typed with grey or old ribbon. A black or new ribbon should be used or the first carbon copy should be sent. ii. Originators are warned that documents may he returned for retyping if there is a risk of filming being unsatisfactory due to indifferent typing resulting in illegibility. iii. Correspondence is not to be stapled together. iv. When documents are microfilmed only OiN’E-fR) ONE copy is xequired and this copy is promptly returned to the originator marked to the effect that it has been microfilmed and despatched. Each document is therefore to be clearly marked in the right hand top corner with the number of repro ductions required in the United Kingdom including the first copy. v. The recipient is to be shown on the letter or form as well as on the cover. 3. On receipt at H.Q., R. A.F., M.E., all correspondence for the United Kingdom will be handled and disposed of in the Headquarters Registries and Microgram Section in accordance with the instructions and under conditions of security as laid down by the Camp Commandant. Letters marked “ Most Secret ” will be despatched in the normal manner. The remaining corres pondence will be opened and examined. Items regarded as unsuitable for the Microgram Service, except those returned to the originator for retyping, will be despatched unprocessed in the usual manner according to the priorities marked on their cover. 1614/Photos.272. Armament and Maintenance Assistants. There are big deficiencies in the above-mentioned trades which, it would appear, are largely due to the lack of proper attention to the instructions contained in Air Ministry Orders A.715/41 and A.482/42. furthermore, it is believed that in some Units flight mechanics are being misemployed as maintenance assistants. 2- It is most important that this should be rectified as soon as possible, and it is requested that the position in these trades mav be carefully reviewed and all aircrafthands employed as armament assistants and maintenance assistants remustered to those trades, if considered suitable. This is a matter which requires constant attention, not only to make good the existing deficiencies, but also to replace losses in the trades arising from airmen bein^ remustered to aircrafthand on promotion and other casualties. When an aircrafthand is detailed tor this employment against an establishment vacancy, remusterinc action should be taken in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of Air Ministry Order A.3'.*8/42 immediately he is considered suitable.

In this accident two members of the crew and one passenger lost their lives. 2. Although he was injured, A.C.2 CROOK attended to the surviving member of the crew, who was seriously injured, and on the following morning started to walk with him towards the nearest town. He finally arranged for a Bedouin to take a message to the nearest Royal Air Force Station, and to shelter him self and his companion until the rescue party arrived. This action probably resulted in the life of the third member of the crew being saved. 3.

Recently there has been an increase in the number of urgent postings necessitating air travel, and the personnel concerned normally request that they may be allowed to take full kit. 2. The allowance of kit for an air passage is 40 lbs and whilst every effort is made to increase this in the case o' postings in order that the officer or airman may not be parted from his heavy kit with consequent risk of loss, it must be emphasised that excess kit can only be carried if there is room on the aircraft without displacing other passengers, mail, or freight. H. In view of the great pressure on aircraft space, baggage allowance for air passages will in future not exceed -10 lbs other than in the most exceptional circumstances. S.2207/MOV. 308.

The attention of all ranks is to be drawn to the following points which are suggested for incorporation in Unit orders. a. No naked lights in tents will be allowed. b. No smoking will be allowed after “ Lights Out.” c. The throwing away of unextinguished cigarettes, matches, pipe ashes or other smouldering material in or near buildings or tents is strictly forbidden. d.

During the next few months, concentrated Orange Juice will be issued in most areas as a substitute for the Fresh Fruit item of the ration when the latter is not available. 2. In order to preserve the Vitamin ‘ C’ content, this Orange Juice contains a proportion of Sulphur Dioxide and therefore requires dilution before consumption. 3. Orange Juice will always be consumed diluted in a proportion of 1 part of concentrated Orange Juice to 5 or more parts of water or Mineral w ater. 4. The scale of issue will be two thirds of an ounce (weight) of concentrated Orange Juice per man per issue. 3541/EQ. 323. Four-Gallon Tins made of Terneplate. Ow ing to the shortage of tinplate, square four-gallon tins, as P.O.L. containers are now liable to be made from terneplate as well as from tinplate. As terneplate, which is steel plate coated with lead, has poison ous properties, any tin made of this material must on no account be used for water or any kind of foodstuffs. 2. All tins made from terneplate will be embossed with the letter “L” (L for Lead). As some thousands, already in circulation, have not been embossed, every’ care must be taken to differentiate between them and ordinary tin plate tins which may continue to be used as containers for water or foodstuffs. An unpainted terneplate tin can easily be identified by its dull colour and by the blackness which will appear on the fingers when rubbed on the tin. A painted tin can easily he identified by rubbing the tin inside the aperture. 3. Used terneplate tins are to be destroyed. This can be done by puncturing them, or by any other means to make them unfit as containers, and then returned to the nearest Army salvage depot. To economise space on a vehicle returning terueplate tins to salvage, the tins should he collapsed where possible. 4. G.R.O. No. 107, Serial No. 7, dated l.'th February 1943 is cancelled.

Any officer or airman not complying with these orders will be liable to disciplinary action. It should be understood that these orders are intended to safeguard health, as malaria is pdways a serious and may be a most dangerous disease. 2 . Officers Commanding Stations and Units will be responsible for all anti-malarial precautions within their units and will be assisted in this work by unit Medical Officers. 3. Station and Unit Commanders will ensure that the following personal preventive measures are enforced: i. After sundown, all ranks will wear slacks and jackets or shirts with long sleeves, buttoned at the wrist. Personnel on duty will ensure that they are in possession of slacks and long sleeved shirts or jackets when the tour of duty is likely to last after dark. ii. Every officer and airman will be in possession of anti-mosquito cream in a suitable container. Anti- mosquito cream will be issued regularly to and used by all ranks. iii. Each officer and airman will be provided with a mosquito or sandfly net. Nets will be inspected regularly to ensure that they are in good repair. iv.

Middle East Command Financial Instructions, Dealing in Currencies, will be issued in due course. TRAQ/2901/1/2/ACCT. « 340. Airmen’s Pay Books - Forms 64, Part II. It has come to notice that, at some Units, Forms 64, Part II, are being handed in to Accounting Sections and retained for too long a period (e.g. 5 days). Attention is therefore drawn to the fact that this procedure is not only unnecessary, but is entirely contrary to regulations. 2 . M.E.W.A.Is. (Cash Services), para. 135 (b), provides for the action to be taken when coining for pay parades, and para. 138 states that Forms 64, Part II, are to be completed when airmen are paid. It is there fore unnecessary for a Form 64 to be out of an airman’s possession for a longer period than is essential at the pay table (or in the pay office when a casual payment is made) to record the payment and for the paying officer or a witnessing officer to sign. Action is therefore to be taken to ensure that regulations are observed in future. TRAQ/2940/ACCT. 341. R.A.F. Officers’ Pay and Allowances Books—Guide to Cash Issues.

Where a fraction of a penny occurs in the sterling equivalent, the fraction will be ignored (e.g. hils 113 will be 2s. 3d., and Fils 60 will be Is. 2d.) 3 . Accountant Officers and Imprest Holders are to take action accordingly. IRAQ/2923/1/ACCT. 342. Allowances - Officers Serving in PERSIA.

Current rates will be promulgated in General Routine Orders in future. ’IRAQ/*925/ACCT.70j 343. Amendments - A.P. 1086. Part 3A - Section 10A.

Applications may therefore be received at Rear Air Headquarters from all airmen qualified in accordance with para. 2 of the above quoted A.M.O. All applications should be submitted on Form 1739 (amended where necessary to read “ recommended for air-bomber training”). It should be noted that Forms 1739 must in every case bear the x-ecommendation of the airman’s Commanding Officer as to the suitability for subsequent commissioned rank, and that they must always be accompanied by Education Certificates. The relevant medical category for airmen applying for Air Bomber Training is ‘‘A.3.B. (Turret) (N.V.C.-).” 3. Attention is directed to the fact that candidates are to be interviewed by an officer not below the rank of Group Captain, unless for reasons outlined in this Headquarters letter,.250l/P3, dated 23rd April 1943, this is impossible.

It must be assumed by Movements Branch that, when an application for movement has been received by them, the personnel concerned are available for movement at short notice. It therefore follows that a. Applications should not be made for personnel who are detached until they have returned to their Unit. b. Application should not be made until personnel are cleared and ready t© move at short notice c. Any casualties affecting mobility should be notified immediately, and a fresh application made when personnel are again readj to move. Last minute substitutions cause considerable trouble. Any substitutions that are necessary must be notified in writing immediately, giving reasons, and also full details of the substitute, exactly as if the latter were a completely new movement. Deletion of one name and substitution of another is not sufficient Jn future, incomplete applications will be returned to Units, who will then be responsible for any consequent delays in movements. ^ ©lOl/MOV 371.

Unnecessary Signalling and Method of Indication of Subject Matter of Signals. 1 The Air Ministry has observed that a great deal of unnecessary signalling is being caused by “ reminder - ’ signals which bear no indication as to the subject matter of the original communication. 2. The attention of all potential originators of signals is, therefore, to be drawn to the fact that when sending “ reminders,” in addition to the reference number and date of the original communication, sufficient information in regard to the previous correspondence must be given to give the recipient all possible assistance in tracing the original signal or letter. 3. “ Reminders ” should, however, rarely be necessary if definite time limits are laid down and interim replies are judiciously used. 4.

Promotions—Officers. Promotions, Officers, are shown at Appendix “ B.” Units are to make necessary promulgations in next issue of Personnel Occurrence Reports. 2441/P2. Fire Fighting Courses. 1. A report has been received from the Officer Commanding, RAF Station, Amman, to the effect that the standard of pupils nominated for the above courses is deplorable. This is borne out by the fact that of the 21 pupils in Course No 15, eight pupils failed to pass. 2. It is emphasised that no useful purpose is served by airmen with insufficient intelligence or interest in the subject attending these courses and in future Commanding Officers are to ensure that airmen detailed are not lacking in these respects. 2524/5/P3. 38.

BPO/58 (6a) 40. Airmen Reporting to tiie Station Education Ofticer on Joining a New Station. It has been brought to notice that many airmen appear to be unaware of the education facilities available on KAb’ Stations, and do not realise that there is a station education officer responsible for the provision of these facilities. One result is that many queries which could be answered on the station are referred directly by the airmen concerned to various academic and professional bodies. Every airman arriving at a station should therefore be instructed to report to the station education officer, as soon as possible, in order that he may be informed of the facilities available under the General Education Scheme. (To be repeated in all Station and Unit Routine Orders.) AHQ/4628/1/ED. 41. External Examinations—Institute of Chartered Accountants. 1 The Council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants is prepared to allow Articled Clerks serving in the Middle East Command, who are qualified to do so, to sit for the Intermediate or Final Examination of this Institute during the month of August, 1944. No arrangements are being made for students serving overseas to take the Preliminary Examination. 2. The fee for each examination is two guineas, which must be paid into the Imprest or Cash Account of the candidate’s unit. The Imprest Holder or Accountant Officer will raise Form I' SU in triplicate therefor. One copy will be used to support the debit in the Cash Book under the heading “ Examination Fees.’ The second receipted copy is to be attached to the application form (see para. 3) and forwarded to the Area Educa tion Officer, Air Headquarters, ’Iraq and Persia, Royal Air Force, Paiforce. It is essential that this second copy of Form 1680 shows clearly the name of the unit and the month of the account. The triplicate is to be given to the candidate as his receipt. 3. The form of application, which is to be raised locally, must quote the following particulars of each candidate Number, Rank, Surname, other names in full, Unit, Trade, Date of Birth, Date of Enlistment, whether intermediate or Final Examination, and the amount of Fee paid. It is to be signed by the candidate, counter signed by the Commanding Officer of the Unit, and is to reach the Area Education Officer by 15th February, 1944.

Iraq/2914/Acct 43. Non-Public Accounts—RAF Levies (’Iraq). 1. The instructions detailed below are issued for compliance regarding the audit of RAF Levies (’Iraq) non-public accounts. 2. a. Wherever possible (e.g. in respect of Levy Companies, etc. located at RAF Stations), audit is to be carried out by the normal RAF Audit Board, and a copy of the balance sheet (but see para. 3 belowi is to be included with other balance sheets supporting the RAF Station Form 2. b. For Levy Companies (and detachments) not situated at a RAF Station, Battalion Commanders are rpponsible for convening Audit Boards and for submitting proceedings, through Headquarters, RAF Levies (’Iraq), to Air Headquarters, ’Iraq and Persia, RAF, Paiforce. c. In respect of Units of the Levies located at RAF Stations under the control of other Formations (e.g. Levant and Aden) arrangements for audit are made by Air Headquarters in conjunction with the Headquarters of the other Formation 3. As regards Company PRI accounts only, a “ Statement of Receipts and Payments,” with information as to Sundry Debtors and Sundry Creditors at the end of the accounting period, may be submitted in lieu of a balance sheet, provided that the necessary certificates of correctness and audit, etc. are inserted ; see GRO No. 573/43. 4. These instructions are to be put into effect as from the four-monthly audit period ended 31st Decem ber, 1943. Iraq/330l/Acct. 44. Salvage—Self-Sealing Tank Materials. Considerable quantities of self-sealing tank materials are lying at Maintenance Units on tanks that have been removed from aircraft. This material is very valuable and is almost all capable of being salvaged. In future, therefore, it is to be removed from all tanks which are being reduced to produce, and returned to No. 107 Maintenance Unit. S.3551/EQ.4 45. Flit Guns. 1. Approximately 90 per cent of the Flit Guns returned to stores as “ unserviceable ” are found on inspection to require very slight attention to restore them to a serviceable condition, the main trouble being shrinkage of the leather washer due to excessive heat. The trouble can be overcome by soaking the w’asher in oil and kneading it with the fingers. Unit Commanders will, therefore, ensure that 100 per cent inspection is carried out and all washers greased and softened and the Flit Guns maintained in a serviceable condition. ■U After inspection as above, all Flit Guns which are found to be unserviceable or requiring major repairs will be returned to stores. 3549/FiQ.g.
