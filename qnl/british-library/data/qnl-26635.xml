Section 1. [E 1529/1529/25] (No. 52.) Sir, Si?' A. Ryrm to Mr. Eden.—(Received March 21.) Jedda, February 26, 1936. WITH reference to Mr. Calvert’s despatch No. 337 o f the 26th November, I have the honour to state that the Mecca newspaper Umm-al-Q.ura announced on the 21 st February the completion of the work of the commissions appointed for the delimitation of the Saudi-Yemen frontier in pursuance of article 4 of the Treaty of Taif of May 1934. The announcement is in the form of a news item, but is doubtless inspired by the Government. As it refers both to the Tihama and the mountains, it presumably relates to both pairs of commissions, each of which was described as a joint Saudi-Yemeni commission in the enclosure in Mr. Calvert’s despatch. 2 . After Mr. Calvert’s despatch was written, the Legation had heard nothing about the delimitation in the Tihama. As regards the inland area, you will have seen by paragraph 393 of the Jedda report for December that two Saiidi commissioners, Sheikh Muhammad Suleyman, who is related to the Minister of Finance, and an officer named Talaat Wafa, were believed to have been in Najran on the 27th December. My Indian vice-consul, who is a friend of Talaat Wafa, subsequently received a letter from him dated from Dhahran on the 17th December. It would therefore appear that the commissioners inland worked both in the mountains and in Najran, but no separate reference is made to the latter area in the recent announcement in the Umrn-al-Qura. 3. The recent announcement states that the delimitation was effected in the most friendly manner, and that no disputes arose. It adds that the members of the commissions have now returned and submitted the result of their labours to their Governments, who have approved of the delimitation agreed upon by the commissions. 4. I hope for an opportunity of obtaining confirmation and any further information from Fuad Bey Hamza, but, as this may not arise until after the approaching Moslem festival, which should end on the 7th March, I prefer not to delay this report. 5.

The commissions, he said, had not worked further to the east. 2. Talaat Wafa, the Saudi commissioner mentioned in my despatch under reference, is now back in Mecca and has given my Indian vice-consul some interesting particulars of his impressions. He had been employed on a commission of reorganisation in Najran and Asir before serving on the Delimitation Commission. He gave a glowing account of the fertility of Najran, saying that he had ridden for a full half-day on camel back through long lines of palm trees. He deplored, however, the sloth of the local inhabitants. 3. Talaat Wafa described the state of the area as peaceful, but said that the commissioners had encountered much difficulty in settling claims and counter claims between the inhabitants of the frontier district. He showed to Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah maps indicating the boundary, but was not parting with any of them. 4. It may be of interest to add that Talaat Wafa, who had taken numerous photographs, showed the vice-consul one of a brass lion, said to date from the EASTERN (Arabia). March 21, 1936. CONFIDENTIAL.

Extract from the Umm-al-Qura of November 22, 1935. Committees for the Delimitation of the Frontiers between the Kingdoms of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. (Translation.) IN accordance with article 4 of the Taif Treaty, in which the frontiers between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen have been fixed, and the provision in the last paragraph of the said article that the delimitation of the frontiers shall be effected on the ground by a committee formed by the two Governments, communications have recently passed between His Majesty the King Abdul Aziz and His Majesty the King Yahya for the appointment of a joint committee from the two parties for the delimitation of the frontier. Iwo committees have, in fact, been appointed, one of which joint committees will undertake to fix the frontiers in the Tihama, and the other to fix the frontiers in the mountains. The first committee met at Jizan, and left for Musim on Wednesday, and will start with the delimitation and determination of the frontier on the basis of the terms of article 4. The second committee will meet at Dhahan (or Dhihan) for the delimitation of the frontiers in the mountains. The proceedings of the two committees will be carried out for the settlement of the matter in the spirit of friendship existing between the two kingdoms. Praise be to God! [581 q—1]My dear Gilbert, You vail remember that we sent you under cover of our official letter No. E 1608/79/25 of the loth April a copy of a sketch-map of the then Saudi-Yemeni frontier, prepared by the Legation at jedda. 2. The Legation have since considered this question further in the light of the Saudi-Yemeni peace treaty and with some help from Euad Bey Hamza, and have now suggested certain amendments. I enclose copies of our correspondence with them. I also enclose a revised copy of the map, which we have had made here in the light of the Chancery letters. Although in sending us the map the Chancery have reminded us that it is M still largely 'guesswork 1 ', you may nevertheless be glad to have a copy of it. enclosures to Blaster _^,t the Colonial office. Fryer at the(E 4151/79/25) No. 1742/209/19) British Legation, Jedda. 12th June 1934. Dear Department, ^4^3 We sent you in our letter No. 550/18/11 of* March 1st, a highly conjectural sketch map attempting to show the possible lie of the de facto frontier between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen and the approximate location of the tribes in the high mountain area, which has figured so largely in recent quarrels. The map was produced very hurriedly from a rough sketch which the Minister had made out and, after the bag had gone, it was found that certain slight mistakes had been made in the process of reproduction. The subsequent rush made it impossible to straighten out the mistakes, which were not very important in view of the conjectural nature of the whole thing. On June 5 the Minister showed his sketch to Fuad, whose previous information was given extempore and may have been misunderstood. In any case he has since picked up additional facts. We now enclose a further sketch, which, though still largely guesswork, is a better attempt to combine certain indications in existing maps with Fuad’s data. It is on the scale originally used by the Minister, 1 inch equals 12 miles and the outlines of the corresponding 1/253,440 sheets of South West Arabia are shown with approximate accuracy, though these go a bit wrong owing to the curvature of the earth and defects of instruments. The main differences are as follows: (a) Fuad is positive that the frontier runs at first pretty Eastern Department, Foreign Office.pretty well due east from the sea. (h) The order of the highland tribes on the Saudi side is now given in block letters as corrected by Fuad. (c) Fuad thinks that the existing maps put the Nazran system as a whole too far north. Thus he locates Badr due east of Dhahran and identifies 'Waila” with the Beni Wail tribe, shown well to the south in the 1/253,440 map. As regards (c), Fuad may well be right. What he says fits in with Philby f s view that the country from Jebel Razih to Najran forms a well marked salient in the frontier. Incidentally, the placing of Baqim is very uncertain, being based on the assumption that it is on one particular road and the statement that it is eleven hours walk from Sa f ada. Fuad r s information shows how much the Imam’s claims to several tribes rests on real or alleged ancestry rather than on geography. The three great names of original stocks appear to be Khaulan, Hamdan, and Qahtan. It appears to be held that the frontier tribes from the Bil Earth to the Beni Malik are of the Khaulan stock; that the tribes whose administrative centre was Haraja are of Qahtan (Of Handbook of Arabia Volume I page 441); but thai: the Beni Wada’a are, like many admittedly Yemeni tribes, of Hamdan. The Imam no doubt claims all ’As£r in principle, but he seems to have made a more particular claim to all tribes of the three stocks named. The conclusion of peace may make all this unimportant for some time to come but (a) we want to give you the best sketch we can in substitution for that sent in our letter of the first March and (b) it is only too possible that the parties will fight another day, perhaps when the heirs of the present rulers come into their own. Yours ever, CHANCERY.(E 4151/79/25) FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 5th July, 1934. Dear Chancery, Many thanks for your letter of the 12th June (No. 1742/209/19) enclosing, with comments, a revised sketch of the Saudi-Yemeni frontier. We are most grateful to you for all the trouble you have taken to make it accurate. Before having it copied and distributed to other departments (as we did with the sketch contained in your letter No. 550/18/11 of the 1st March) we propose to wait and see whether you wish to confirm, correct, or amplify anything in the sketch in the light of the detailed definition of the frontier which, we understand, the treaty gives.

As we stated in our despatch No. 240 of the 30th July, the article is, to the individual unacquainted with the terrain, an almost unintelligible string of place and tribal names. (a) A1 Musim, given in our sketch as ?Muwassim, and its position north of the point where the frontier meets the coast. We are unable to identify this place on the map (though we see a place Al Washim at the mouth of the Wadi Ta'ashar, but that scarcely seems an incorrect rendering of Al M&amp;sim), and so cannot say how far north of the frontier it lies. (b) Wa’alan, on the Saudi side of the frontier. It is both mentioned in Article 4 and shown on the Ordnance Survey Map, so may as well go into our sketch. (c) The two tribal names of Bil Harth and Abadil, shown in our sketch as lying wholly on the Saudi side of the frontier are both, according to Article 4, partly in the We have again studied the sketch in the light of the The results, however, relate chiefly to:- Yemen Eastern Department, Foreign Office.Yemen, though largely in Saudi Arabia. This, it is sug gested, might he shown in the sketch. The general trend of the frontier is fairly clear, with such names as Medi, Haradh, part of the Earth, part of the Abadil, Razih and Beni Jama r a falling to the Yemeni side, whilst on the Saudi side Wa f alan, Faifa, Beni Malik and Dhahran are confirmed, even if they are only very approximately located. The changes are so few that we venture to think it unnecessary for us to reproduce the sketch-map to embody them.

Extract f r om .Despatch jso.340 dated Jedda, July 30, 1934. 2. Further study has served little to elucidate the obscurities of article 4 of this document. These arise partly from the absence of any trustworthy and sufficiently detailed map of the area, but more especially from the rather confusing use of the same word to denote the name of a tribe and at the same time to describe its tribal grazing-ground or dira. These latter are, moreover, known accurately probably only to the tribes owning them and to neighbouring tribes, who may or may not be in entire agreement as to their boundaries. Until the terrain through which this frontier runs is accurately mapped and surveyed, article 4 will, it is believed, continue to be a somewhat unintelligible concatenation of place and tribal names. \ \P.Z. 6623 7 34. Confidential. ■Extract from the Treaty of Taif. ARTICLE 4. The frontier line which divides the countries of the two high contracting parties is explained in sufficient detail hereunder. This line is considered as a fixed dividing boundary between the territories subject to each. The frontier line between the two kingdoms begins at a point half way between Medi and A1 Musim on the coast of the Red ^ea, and (runs) up to the mountains of the Tihama in an easterly direction. It then turns northwards until it ends on the north-west boundary between the Beni Jama’a and (the tribes) adjacent to them on the north and west. It then bends east until it ends at a point between the limits of baqa’a and Wa’ar, which belong to the Waila tribe, and the limits of the Yam. It then bends until it reaches the pass of Marwan and Aqaba Rifada. It then bends eastwards until it ends, on the east, on the edge of the boundary between those of the Hsmdan-bin-Zaid, Waila, &amp;c., who are outside Yam, and Yam. Everything on the right hand side of the above-mentioned line, which runs from the point mentioned on the sea shore up to the end of the borders on all sides of the mountains mentioned, shall belong to the Yemen, and everything on the left of the above-mentioned line shall belong to the Saudi Arab Kingdom. On the Yemen side are Medi, Haradh, part of the Harth tribe, Mir, the Dhahir Mountains, Shada, Bhay’a, part of the Abadil, all the country and the mountains of Razih, Manbah, with Arwa-al-Amshaykk, all the country and the mountains of Beni Jama’a, Sahar-ash-Sham, Yabad and its neighbourhood, the Maraisagha area of the Sahar-ash-Sham, the whole of Sahar, JNaqa’a, Wa’ar, the whole of Waila, and also Ear with Aqabat Bahuqa, the whole of Hamdam-bin-Zaid, which is outside Yam and Wad’a Dhahran. These mentioned, and their//6 © 2 . their territories within their known limits, and all 'between the said directions and their vicinities, the names of which are not mentioned and which were actually subject to or under the control of the Yemeni Kingdom before the year 1352, are on the Yemeni side and belong to the Yemen. On the left hand side are Musam, Wa’lan, most of the narth, the Khuba, the Jabri, most of the Abadil, all Faifa, beni Malik, Beni Haris, the Al Talid, Q,ahtan, Dhahran, Wadi'a, all the Wadi*a Dhahran, together with the pass of Marwan, and Aqaba Rifada, and the area lying beyond on the east and north of Yam and Najran, Hadhim, Zur Wada, all the Waila in Hajran, and all below Aqaba buhuqa, up to the edges of iMajran and Yam on the east, all these, and their territories within their known limits, and all between the named directions and their vicinities which have not been mentioned by name, and which were actually subject to or under the control of the Saudi Arab Kingdom before the year 1352, are on the left of the said line and belong to the Saudi Arab Kingdom. Everything mentioned regarding Yam, Bajran, Hadan, Zur Wad 1 a, and all the Waila in Bajran, is in accordance with the decision (Tahkim) of His Majesty the Imam Yahya to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz as regards Yam, and the judgment (Hukm) of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz that all of it should belong to the Saudi Arab Kingdom; a.nd while the Hadan and Zur Wad’a and the Waila in Bajran belong to Waila and except in so far as has been mentioned, do not come within the Saudi Arab Kingdom, this shall not prevent them nor tneir brothers of Waila from enjoying mutual relations and intercourse and the usual and customary co-operation. This line then extends from the end of the above-mentioned limits between the edges of the Saudi Arab trioes and of those of the Hamdam-bin-Zaid, and all the Yemeni tribes who are outside Yam. All the borders and the Yemeni territories up to the end of the Yemeni frontier in/3. in all directions belong to the Yemeni Kingdom; and all the borders and territories up to the end of their boundaries, in all directions, belong to the Saudi Arab Kingdom. All points mentioned in this article, whether north, south, east or west, are to be considered in accordance with the general trend of the frontier line in the directions indicated; often obstacles cause it to bend into the country of one or other kingdom. As regards the determination and fixing of the said line, the separating out of the tribes and the settlement of their diras in the best manner, these shall be effected by a committee formed of an equal number of persons from the two parties, in a friendly and brotherly way and without prejudice, according to tribal usage and custom.No. E.1608/79/25.

Dear Department, Your letter E 716/79/25 of February Bi as we intimated in our telegram No. 7 of January 19 and despatch No. 15 of January 23, paragraph 2, we share your difficulty in determining the position of the Beni Malik and ’Abadil. We have assumed that the Ahl Faifa could be identified with the Jebel Faifa, which is shown, though not necessarily correctly any more than any other inland point, in the maps. You have doubtless consulted the Handbook of Arabia and seen how impossible it is to reconcile the information given about the two Beni Malik tribes described at Vol.I.pp.430 and 495 with our recent indications. One of these which you may not have on record is that there is a definite region called Jebel Beni Malik close to the presumed frontier. You will by now have received our despatch No. 22 of January 27 enclosing an account of the Minister's conversation with Fuad on January 24, in the course of which Fuad illustrated his remarks by a rough sketch. This was in itself of toolittle value to send home but Sir Andrew has now prepared from it and from existing maps the enclosed sketch. You will realise that it is i^uite conjectural and is merely intended to give a rough idea of how the land may lie and how the tribes may be disposed along the frontier. It/ Eastern Department, Foreign Office.It has been necessary for one thing to adopt Fuad’s data, e.g., he shows the lower arm of his 3 as running east from the sea but he placed Wa’lan on it, whereas Wa’lan is shown in Sheet 3 of the 1/253440 map very much further north. The map indeed puts it still further north than the dotted line in the sketch, but if full account had been taken of this the sketch would have become quite impossible. We enclose a portion of another document, which has gained in interest since we contented ourselves with a general account of it in our aespatch No. 186 of June 18 last. This is an extract from the article on ’Asir in the ’’Umm-al-Qura” of June 9, 1933. You will observe that the ”Umm-al-Q,ura” article does not mention the Beni Malik. The explanation almost certainly is that they and their mountain are just across the boundary between the Tihama province and ’Asir Surat, the distinction between which the Saudi Government were very keen to emphasise at that time. The Aden telegram to which you refer is doubtless one which reached us in so corrupt a form on January 31 that we could not decypher the name of the attacking tribe. If it was Benghazi, they are doubtless identical with the Bil Ghazi, who have been mentioned on various occasions, e.g., in the enclosed extract and the communique enclosed in our despatch No. 71 of March 3, 1933. The one thing clear is that all these tribes, who lie on a sort of crescent over against Sa’ada, are exceedingly marginal and have no loyalty to Ibn Saud. They have probably very little love of the Imam either but they seem to cling to the Idrisi. Some or all of them took part in the 1932 rebellion. It was in the Faifa/Paifa area that Hasan took refuge when it petered, out, skipping tron there into definitely Yeaeni territory* And it is now in the same region that 'Abdul Wahhab al Idrisi has joined in or created a fresh revolt, which may be only a stirring up of the embers of the old. We have been tempted to think that the area now in question was that claimed by the Imam under the name ol Hamazan or Hamdan, when the Saudi delegation were at San'a. This would make his claim intelligible, i.e., he would have been asking for the Tihama, the area now in question and the yahtan country, that of the tribes whose overlord was Ibn Dhulaym; the whole frontier area in fact as far as Najran, which he regarded as his own in any case. This has some value as a working theory but we must coni ess that all attempts to associate the very common name Hamdan with the particular area have broken down* One more point:- The Minister, when at home, told Johnstone that he though 'Asir Tihama was the approved Saudi name for the province formed out of the former Idrisi territory* He now thinks that the more approved form is Tihamat 'Asir. You may find us using both, as Asir Tihama is more euphonious and a nicer contrast to Asir Surat, but the meaning is clear whatever order is used, i.e., the conjunction of Tihama and 'Asir indicates the littoral and that part of the highlands of which the Idrisi was still the ruler in 1926.
