D&amp;t®d th© 2nd August, 1920. , Bin S&amp;iuci. After oomplinisnts. Before Syed Siddiq Hasan loft Bahrain, 1 gave him order to Inform 'Your Excellency verbally regarding the situation in Iraq, and eapeoially with regard to the trouble which the Govt was having with the 'Ashaiyir' in the vicinity of Nejef and Kerbela. I am now in position to gxve you fuller details regarding these troubles, as I have recently received several letters from Colonel Wilson on the subject. Knowing that 'Your Excel lency is always anxious to receive true news of affairs in IHA*, I hasten to inform you. As Your Exceli.ncy knows Great Britain has been given the mandate of governing Iraq, and has undertaken to manage affaiis there until such time as the people of Iraq are in a position to govern themselves. In th® meantime His Majesty's Government has given out that she intends t© start an Arab form of Govt, under her protecting hand, aa soon as -she can conveniently do so. Certain people in Iraq, howevar, more especially the Shiahs of Kerbela and Nejef, led by the very well known Allm Mirza Muhd. Taqi Shirazi, and his son Mirza Muhd. Reza, not content to let things quietly, started a strong agitation and demanded self-Government for Iraq atonce. Like children who attempted to run before they could walk, they fell. It is be lieved also, but this has not yet besjn proved, that the Shiah Ulama of Nejef were themselves instigated by agents of Shareef Faisal. The latter, aa you know, is anxious for his brother Abdullah to be nominated King of Iraq, and has many secret agents today working throughout the country for this purpose. Naturally the High Government could not tolerate that the Ulama of Najaf should dictate terms to i't, and contented itself by giving answer that everything would come in God'sgood time, and ra-it©rat©d G®vt f s promis©s and intentions of eventually granting IHAQ a form of Self-Govt. under British management. This reply angered the Nejef Ulama, who did their best to stir up the tribes of IkAQ against the High Government. God brought to naught their evil in tentions, and they were completely unsuooesaful except in the vicinity of Kerbela and Na jefIn these districts, the tribes,mostly consisting of th© Al-Hasan, taking as a pre text the fact that one of their Shaikhs had b^en imprisoned rose and cut th© Railway in several places n©ar the small town called Rumaitha. They then besieged Rumaitha and its i small garrison. Various other small villages near Kejef also fell into their hands, there being no troops nearer than at Baghdad. The High Govt, acted quickly. It sent a force of troops and aeroplanes, and after dispersing a force of 2000 Arabs of the A1 Hasan, and inflicting very loss on them, they relieved RUilAITHA and rescued the Pelitical Officer who was there. Having inflicted this' defeat on the Al-Hasan the Govt, has turned its attention to crushing the trouble round Nejef and has brought large numbers of troops into the Hillah District. Operations are now proceeding systsmati- cally and the tribe of Al-Hasan are being gradually huntsd dswn. The Railway today as I writs has not yet been monded because of the flooded nature of the country through which it passes. V.'ork however is proceeding on its repair rapidly. Regard ing Hejef itself and Kerbela l?hich are the heart ®f the trouble Govt, has arrested 40 of the ring-leaders, and deported them t© Henjam Island tear bandar Abbas, included among the dsporteed id by nama the son of Mirza Muhammad Taqi, iJsaxatsi Muhd. Reza. He is un doubtedly the most dangerous agitator in IRAQ. This mad young man according to the latest news, has been sent off to Tehran to be guarded by the Persian Government. In the meantime,though th© Shiahs ©f Nejef and Kerbela show hostility towRrds Govt., it is pleasing to relate that th® important Sunniea of Baghdad and Basrah have rallied r®und t® Govt. Men like the^ Naqib of Baghdad, Syed Talib Pasha of Busrah, and Ahmad Pasha Banna, and many others are strongly supporting Government today. Syed Talib himself is now at Baghdad,working hand in glove with the Government.-i m y © Both baarLih and Mosul Vilayats are entirely quiet by God's grao©. In It is only round about Kerbela, Najaf and KUFA that the rebellion exists, as lour SxcellBncy knows from h i^st^r y^a r e' ^living up to their reputation as being M KUFiiAN WA NIFAQ' . Govt, oould not have f done more for the peopie of these two towns than it has, yet their conduct is ungrateful and resembles that of the ill-bred dog which bites the hand @f' the master who gives it bread. It was similar con duct, you will rememberthat compelid your ancestor, the Gr®4t Saud, to destroy Nojef as punishment. In the meantime all goes well.Govt, has the situation well in hand and a frssh Division of troops has been despatched to IRAQ from India. There is no cause for anxiety.

A«0« As you are probably aware ,and as I have before informed icour Honour,the present state of Arabia is due to the unsettled state of the world and the machinations of evil-doers,consisting mainly of Turkish Agents and their friends. Tp-day they are interferring with Syria and the people of , Iraq and are simply playing fast and loose with its people by means of their tools the Sharif and his sons. Long ago I pointed ail this out to you* Further the Sharif and his sons have without ceasing been instigating His Majesty's officials against me out of sheer hatred for myself and in prder to aggrandize himself at my expense; their object being either to keep me busy or force me to join their party(the Nationalists). God willing they will fail. Regarding Bin Rashid. For long I have been trying to win his good willj but he avoids my advances;because of the false hopea, held out to him by the Sharif. Recently Bin Rashid^ party showed their hand,coolness having arisen between us. The Sharif has n@w V promised his support in money and arms. Munition and supplies have already reached Hail more are about to leave from Madina. I have absolutely correct knowledge of this. 3yed Siddiq. Hasan himself has been shown my agent's letters to this effect.(Oorroborated by Syed Siddiq Hasan in his recent reports from Riyadh). Regarding Bin Sabah,outwardly he is apparently negotiating in a friendly manner,but secretly he is working against me. Outwardly all the above mentioned individuals pretend friend ship with England but behind her back they are intriguing her interests,and are benefitting themselves from external aourcea. They are thus making friends wi|r the enemy, in case things go wrong.

All the notables of Kuwait used ahusive language openly ,mentioning my name in coffee shops Kiiere the Sheikh of Kuwait spread out false rumours in the presence o my cousin,and ray servants and collected man to fire $hots in the air and to make an exhibition of joy pretending that Bin Bashid had defeated iae and killed c # and thus great disrespect and insult was show towards me and my ambassador v&gt;o great was this 1-hat t as unabl@ to descri*b© it.Further inor® when asir as oaud wanted to go and pay his respects to the Political Agent fch® 3h«jJch Ox Kuwait frhade him from doing so at first and thus Jiaad. iaslr was unalil 9 to 8®e th® Political Agent for laany days.» Finally Shsikli Jalin himself went and took Nasir hin .!aud to the Political Agent where also much dis- plsasing talk .as listened to. Later Nasir left Kuwait and came hack to me with a ues sage ■* cm Sheikh Salto , th® absurd contents of which as yon ;ill see from the copy sent you .have no origin ; It is only out of my own decency and for the satisfaction of His Majesty's Govem- iientthat I ai» overlooking y rights, y relations with him have now been severed and if the matter is referable to His ajesty's Government they may kindly decide the boundaries, between us and lay down new terms for the assur ice and case of both sides. And whatever will be proved to have been avoided by my fore-fathers I shall do the same,and the surety for this in His Majesty's Govern ment, and tills is what I want . If the matter is merely to be left again between me and Sheikh Jalem.and if Govern ment do not wish to interfere with us,I anticipate good in what happens;! now request you to decide the question as soon as possible .as to whether I or I or His Majesty Government to settle the matter,If I am again to be asked to settle in peaceable manner with Jalem ,1 pray to be ranee ;surely,his character is well known to your Honour. y whole object is to settle the matter before anything serious happens. From ray side God willing there will not be the least momeraent .except if he makes, a move himself and attacks my tribesmen,in which case I am not responsible. tj _» has wind in his head,and is overcome by igno-Translation of a letter dated 20th Dhill Qaad 1538,(6th August 1920) from Bin Saud to Political Agent,Bahrain. A.G, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your cordial letter dated 11th Dhill ftaad 1338,(26th July 1920) containing a telegraphic message from the Hon'hle Sir Arnold Wilson K.C.I .E. which I fully noted,and I would reauest you kindly to telegraph to His Honour that I am highly grateful to H .M, *3 Government for their kind consideration. I may further state that it is my constant aim and object to acquire their approbation ,and to consider the common interests of hoth sides . On receipt of H.M,Govern- mentis message I at once complied with instructions con- tnttivriiitfii'tlirrrlri and sent off to Mecca my cousin Ahmad hin Thenyan As-Saud;I also permitted any person who wished to pay a visit to the Holy house of God to accompany him,their number is very small ,as I informed your Honour in my pre vious letter . This you have already read and must not have found very satisfactory . Left to myself I do not think I would have sent any one ;but I decided that Ahmad 'bin Thenyan should go out of consideration or my friends the High British Government. This in compliance with their instructions as I have said ahove. Kindly convey my hest respects to the afore said Hon'Ble gentleman{Sir Arnold Wilson). My respected father and sons Saud and Faisal and their brothers send you their best salams. Ahmad bin Thanaiyan with K.S.Saiyed Siddiq, Hassan and Farhan beg Al- Eahamah have on this day left for Holy Mecca. U.B,I Copy of a letter Mo. 9 dated 29tli July 1920 from Khan Baheb Sayyad Siddlq Hasan, Indian Assistant, Bahrain, ( on at deputation / RiyadhJ,to the Political Agent, Bahrain. I beg to report below the gist of Bin Baud's long conversation with me last evening in his private Majlis. Farhan Beg was also present. Bin Baud started b^ saying that the world was still very much disturbed ,, Iausharbak ,, and that the British Govern ment had a very difficult task to perform to rest/ore peace and tranquility etc. There were troubles everywhere, India, Egypt, Iraq, Syria and even England itself. The Government were not following a strong or correct policy such as is most essential for the peace and order especially of Arabia and Arab countries. The Government were too lenient and consider ate to ensure respect and fear on Arabs* ^art. Their worst blunder was that really good, respectable and useful men were ignored and cast away while upstarts and mean whirming impostors 'Aradhil wa mutamalliqin ,, were advanced, favoured and pampered. This was what the Turk did and ruined himself for ever. He often pondered over things and events and did not see that Government knew exactly who was their friend and who i was an enemy. He went on to say that as he explained to you at length, it was not good policy on Government's part to seek to conciliate Arabs by heaping favours and gifts upon them especially when Government saw that they only got in return contumacy, intrigue and rebellion. Arabs could not be well governed except by force mixed with Justice. Constitutional Government such as was being thought of for Iraq will only bring more trouble ans unrest and entail serious consequences which were nor dreamed of at present.hese he ent to nment fh P»A» in. ;f ■ I here tried to put in a few words about the Britieh having aooepted a moral responsibility, as a Mandatory Power, of administering the country with the help and co-operation of the natives and gradually training them to Idok after their own affairs and that this was the matured judgement of the League of Mations and Peace Conference etc* etc. Bin Baud, however, went on with his usual flow of * eloquence.^Look at the Sharif* he said n and his sons Faisal and Abdullah, what are they doing now? I know for certain that M they are ^extremely pampered ^as they are, by the British Government^ are actually intriguing against and vilifying the Knglish in Hejaz, in Syria and Palestine and in Iraq?. any of So one, he said, cared for or wanted either the Sharif or/his sons; still Government made so much of them and would go on xx supporting them. He had himself received letters and secret xx pamphlets from Faisal tempting and cajoling him to Join them; but he could not possibly do so. He could not afford to be unfaithful to his pledges or be disloyal to the British Government as long as they did not break their treaty with him. He has been always true to his w rd and will always be ao , because his religion enforces loyalty to treaty obligations. He quoted from Quran 'Fastaqimu lahmm mastaqamu lakum ,, { Be faithful to them ( who are in treaty with you ) as long as they are faithful to you ). tiehimself,on the contrary, was not cared for by Government. Even his subsidy was stopped for two months which act of Government gave him the greatest chagrin tL e had been granted this comparatively little monetary help ( X^nah Maliyah ) that is the subsidy in return for great sacrifices he had made for Government. He had only for their sake given up for ever the rich teritories of Koweit, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman all of which were his as having been conquered by his grand-father Faisal. He could take possession of these landslande at anv time in the paet and in t&amp;a future but he must ref^rain from any ouch action which is contrary to treaty and opposed to the interests of nis friend, the British Government. He has ewen now received letters from Syria, from Mesul and from %ghdad itself begging him to take over these places and rahe over them or help them in establishing their own Governmecfct* He refused to listen to these appeals and temptations tmm for Government's sake. Even at the present moment he has delegates here from Syria. He is best with these difficulties a^d is doing hie best; but he is disregarded by Government who bI do not help him, and at the same time he is calledupon to perfor: \* an almost impossible task of teH: holding in check a most turbulen mass of men the *sa2tadayineh ,, ( Akhwan ) whose numbers now come to no less than 100,000 men. The whole of Sejd is now by virtue of the religious awakening, 'Bar ale a t-aly Din' so closely united as if all were one heart and soul and, as is too well known, they regard every other people as 'Kafir wa Mushrik'(heretics/ and polytheiits or idolaterous ) whose livee and properties were 'Halal' ( allowable ) to them. Who could check these fiery warriors in their burning religious zeal to spread their creed and conquer all who are near and around them? Who can check them except God and Abdul-Aziz? They are all hungry ( jua'nin ) in want of food and clothing and money and he is at his wits' ends how to supply their wants. It is with the greatest difficul ty that he has bee doing so far without any outside means or knX help from Government in whose interests, as well as his own, he was striving every nerve to work succesfUlly and satiefactorily 'ashar al lail wa ajua bil nahar' i.e. passing sleepless nights and remaining hungry and abstaining from food by day/ And what did His Majesty's Government dot They put him down as a comrson, almost insignificant little chief, a Badu in Central Arabia who knwo nothing of the worid5 They regarded him as a junior, even a vassal to the Sharif whom they have made into 'Malik Husain ' and yet this -Hng was till yesterday3 yesterday a subject of the Turks, called only^Sharif-Mecca*, nominally 11 Amir ^ejaz w with a Qaim-Muqam f s rank/ He Sharif is being lavishly supplied with inoney and given all material help to an extent that he is not only himself living in comfort and luxury, but has enough to spare on outside intrigues in all the countries bordering on or in any way connected with the Hejaz. Large sums ae bribes were being sent to Syria, to Iraq and lejd, •Assir Bajran etc. Even Igypt had the advantage of this overflow of gold from Mecca# Difficulties were thus created for and extra expense caused to him. Bin Saud, It was as the result of the Sharif's intrigue, for instance, that he Bin Baud had to send a big expedition of 30,000 men to Majran and •Assir under his cousin Abdul Aziz bin Mus^id who went out in Hamazan ( 2 months ago ) and was still in 'Assir. The Sharif had incited Ibn Marai with bribes and letters and emissaries to commit several acta of hostility and high handed ness aganist the Imam Idrisi and also ill-treated Sin Baud's border tribes# Imam Idrisi had written to him ( Bin Saud ) for help and hence the expedition,,both to help defending his distanttribes and his good friend the Idrisi* This expedition alone had cost him a large sum, the last amount x&amp;mp despatched to Bin Mus'aid in 'Assir one day before my arrival in Riyadh, was £T 4,COO/- which, he called God to witness, was obtained on loan# He was heavily in debt and would have to seek mors iasc loans although there was no prospect of easy borrowing in Hejd# Ciusaibi { Abdul Aziz bin Hasan ) alone was due Es. 90,000/- which figure was conveyed to Bin Baud in a letter brought by the man who escorted me frote Hoffuf to Riyadh. Q.atif ( Ali bin Fairs probably claimed a debt of Rs. 50,000/-. If His Majesty's Government had any regard for him, their Sincere add loyal friend, it was time they helped him as he had already submitted matter to Government through the Political Agent, Bahrain* It was British Government who had tied his hands and his own nature and religion 'tabai' wa dini*, was forcing him to abide by his pledges; otherwise his sheer needs and circumstances would rather have him break off and strike right and left nearand far* He neod only give the word *01^ and the whole of Jazirat-al-Arab would be overrun. Hie power could be fair ly estimated from the fact that the three recent gazus ( expeditions ) of Ad-Darwish against Koweit, of Saud against Shaimnar and Bin Mus'aid against 'Assir consisted of 7,000A, 15,000/- and 10,000/- men respectively, going almost stmmltaneously and each of these was thoroughly successful. On my expressing a doubt as to whether these and similar gazus were justifiable according to the tenets of Islam and general principles of humanity , Bin Baud said that they wmw were Justifiable# necessary and desirablej firstly, they were sent out in self defence# he said to safeguard essential interests and to avenge wrong done to him and his people. Secondly his creed tells him to regard those Musalmans who do not follow the real comTnandments ( as the Wahabi does, he evidently meant to say ) as 'Murtad', apostates, deserving a worse treatment than that meted out to • Ahl-al-Kitab 1 * ( people of the book, namely followers of other revealed religions than Islam ). The Muslims (Wahabis were meant of course ) were at liberty, nay commanded to fight such pseudo-Mussalmans whom Quran called the^Murtad? apostates, and take their lives and property unless they became Muslims ( rather Wahabis )• The Sharif and the Hejazis were the worst of all these pseudo-Mussalmans, as they had all evils, smoking,dunking, debauchery and Lawatah ( unnatural crime ) prevailing among them and they had nothing of religion except name. Bin Saud then passed on the Sharif f B incessant use oC spies and ,l Muharril^in ,, who were employed against Bin Saud. There were many of these in Hejd and Iraq, Jebel Shammar,smii Yemen etc. Muhaisnad Al-Osaimi, Sayyad J-alib, Sal eh ad-Daghis- tani were the chief of them. He once warned Sir Percy Cox against Sayyad Talib whom he described as ^Mai-Wabrah*, water of Wabrah ( fen the route from Iraq to $a!|l according to . Farhan Beg ), clear, bright, sweet to drink, but as soon as it goes into the stomach it causes a griping pain amd motion.Sucb was the notorlQus Talib whom Government had now again allowed to return to Iraq* He also said that he had reason to suspect that Shaikh Sallm was instigated by Talib and Kha2 f al, both of whom were his old friends^ but were by nature inclined to to get mischief. If nothing else Talib would love/a chance fof coming forward as an intermediary professing friendship and goodwill for both sides. Bin Saud wondered how and why this worhty was allowed to return to ts Iraq at all in these days when there were other disturbing factors in Iraq. Tries e were the topics Bin Saud spoke about to his heart's content, saying that he loved outspokenness or plain talk and that we were the persons he could beet talk to, there being none in his own 'Hashiyah 1 ', circle, with whom he could discuss such matters and unburden his mind. He concluded by saying that his patience had nearly been exhausted as all his long representations which he had been making to Government from time to time about the Sharif and about hie own condition and requirements and aspirations had apparently passed gwnjcx away into oblivion, even the full and clear verbal communications he made to you in Hassa in last winter did not bear fruit. I could only say that you had submittedevery thing perfectly clearly and fully to H.B.M's Government, and that they will doubtless give these matters their best considerations with, it may be hoped, good results in future.Copy of a Maaorandum No. 10, dated 30fch July 19E0, from Khan Sahib ayed Siddlq. Hasan Indian Assist ant Bahrein( on deputation at Riyadh), to the Politi cal Agant, Bahrein, I heg to report that Bin Saud today showed me two letters shewing that the Shareef has sent Bin Baschid a 'big supply of anas and aamunition for fight ing Bin Saud. One of the letters is anonymous which is writ ten, Bin Saud says, 'by a secret informer of his,liming near Medina. It states that on Sunday the 3rd Dhil- Qaadah (20th July) the Shareef sent from Medinah, an emissary called Daghistani, with a message to Bin Bash only id that his request could he met/as far as ammuni tion, arms and supplies went, and those would Ije sup plied when wanted; hut that no force could he se t from Hejaa to help Bin Baschid to fight against Bin Saud in any case (letter undated and unsigned). The second letter dated 6th Dhil-Q,aadah(23rd July) from one Ibrahim hin Sakhaibar who. Bin Saud says, is a native of Riyadh sent secretly on pretence of heing deported from Hejd having incurred Bin Saud's wrath. In this it is stated that writer had returned to Qassim leaving Medinah on 2nd Dhil-Qaadah (19th July). Two days before he left Medinah, Bin Baschid's emissaries had arrived there and were accorded a cordial reception and given valuable gifts and present The Shareef had set apart 7 camel-loads of gun(artil- lery) ammunition for sending to Bin Raschid. The day writer was leaving one Aamir,servant of Bin Baschid, also arrived at edina$,and he,too,was very well re ceived. He had brought letters from Bin Raschid and the Shareof promised to give him 6,000 hexes of arms anii amunition for Bin Raschid, also 6,000 boxes of&amp; &amp;&gt; ir gun powder. Oaiaels were 'being ordered Tor carrying t these to HAH. when writer left Medina (on 19th July). On my expressing some doubt on the truth of the story, and the reliahillty of the writer of the letter in question, rbrahim hin Sakhaibay StasScfasxx Bin Saud stated that the story sight he a little hit exaggerat ed and in reality lesser quantities than those mention ed ahove might he given; hut that the man was reliable and is employed especially for secret information. Bin Saud added there were other news to hand from Qassim and elsewhere that Bin Raschid had re ceived arms ammunition and supplies from the Hejaz Government for fighting Bin Saud, and that he expect ed more definite information regarding the relations of the Shareef and Bin Rasohid, and latter's intended move on Nejd, Bin Saud said this was the Shareef with whom His ajesty's Govern;;ent wanted him, .Bin Saud, to meet and discuss matters in a friendly way, and arrive at an amicable settlement of outstanding questions, which he knew was next to impossible as long as the Government allowed the Shareef to commit such acts of open hostility unchecked and unpunished. I I |m ivCopy of a D.O. letter dated Slst July 19S0 from Khan Saheb Bayyad Biddiq ^asan, Indian Assistant, ^ahrain, { on deputa tion, Riyadh ) to Major H .R # P. Dickson, C.I»E., Political Agent, Bahrain# We are still lying here in a terrible suspense as Bin Saud would not 'budge kk without a final reply to his last h letter to you which is expected every hour,He talks a lot as you will see froia two long reports I am sending you today ( my los. 9 and 30 ), He is not at all in good spirits though very kind to us« • Yesterday i had a little brush up with our friend | Ahmad Thaniyan whom you know very well. In talking of Bin Saudis affairs and Governments inattention (so called ) he said^Major Dickson only forwards letters, he has no power etc# Both Farhan Beg and myself naturally felt annoyed as it was not only impertinence but wrong and mischievous remark# On our talking rather sharply and telling him howrauch you had L'l done for Bin Saud whose interests you had made as your own, the gentleman changed at once and started to speak in a differs ent strain - appreciation, gratitude and the like. To my amazement Bin Saud himself said in the course of conversation in the evening ( probably an echo of Ahmad If Thaniyan f s talk of the noon ) that his agents in Bahrain, wWukalai fil Bahrain ' had written to say that Major Dickson did not take as much interest in his ( Bin Baud's ) affairs y as formerly. Vie both argued the point and Bin Saud was evidentl satisfied with our explanations. Farhan is positive r that it is worthy Yusuf Kanoo doing petty mischief. He it is and not Qusaibi ( as I thought ) who must have written some txa trash to the Imam, who you know is so fond of getting news from any place or person. The truth of the matter is that poor Bin Saud is extremly bored and worried now-a-days as you will see from my reports and his own letter to you which he sent me to glane at just nowIT® I Just now. His indebtedness, increasing expenditure, the, actions of Sharifs,Bin Raschid and Bin Sabah have all joined together to make Abdul-Aziz unhappy as he / appears to me. He is even a bit nervous. In talking to the Kuwait deputa tion yesterday morning he blushed red all of a sudden and spoke in greatly irritated, almost undignified tone •'Take your camels away, there they are, as many as I could collect, I cannot keep them as Shariah makes it Haram for me to do so. of Let Salim expect no good txam me, no^ friendship or ralations, all is over. As to Bin Raschid, before the month is out I shall be on his head in Hail*. Still Bin Saud is very kind and coirteous to us. He sends for us daily about twice a day and also came and saw us in our room today. H@ took me round to his Mudhif ( guest house ), his big toshakhana and the guests' dining &amp;a: hall# All these point out to a very iarge expenditure. I saw some dozen big degs each said to hold five Zabihahs ehteep with rice, some scores of Badus dining and an equal number receiving the Kiswah and busy putting the robes on as soon as handed to them by Ibn Shalhub and his lieutentants. The Imam looked at all this with much self satisfaction saying *Hadha Shughl Badu wa 'atao hum etc. 11 He would repeatedly say that this entertainment and presents of cloth and money went on daily and emptied his coffers. It is very interesting to note that in talking about general health and Doctor for Riyadh Bin Saud said he was very anxious to have a doctor as soon as may be, be it an Indian or an Englishman, he only wanted a good man professionally and morally. I said an English doctor would be better, especially as a surgeon. I did not say but I know from experience that an Indian Muslim Doctor ( unless he is a Wahabi and regular in prayers, fasting etc. briefly actively religious ) will be more hated than an Englishman, who will only have to avoid drinking to be tolerably liked here. ExceptExcept for the heat Riyadh is a very good place, only too much of the religious mania, a stranger must expett to hear or overhear curses even in reply to salitam# My habit of prayer saying has stood in good stead and I have perforce mad© a^Muealman* of Farhan Beg wh® was less regular before. The heat and flies by day make it very unpleasant, lights are ideal, nice and cool and calm. Water is good and becomes icy cool in the skins covered with goony bags - a great relief indded. There fk are very good xsrtR. gardens, we have been inside of two of both the Imams. Grapes, dates, figs, water melond, Khokhs are all very good and we, at least, get a plenty of them. The town is less dirty than Manamah but just under the soor there are heaps of filth and rubbish. All is well except that we are rather sorry over the prospect of HaJJ* perhaps we may not get a chance at all which will be very bad indeed, from All points of view. I hope all is well in Bahrain and that you are enjoying the best of health, by grace of God. Your orders are every moment awaited. I send this with two olbher covers and Bin Saud^ letter at 4 P.M. to-day, Saturday, Slst July 1920. Farhan Beg is doing splendidly and sends you his regards. With best wishes. As I am closing news is received from l Assir that -^in Saud^ cousin Abdul Aziz bin Mua'aid has captured Ubbaha or Ibbaha the chief town of 'Assir, and that Bin Marai has, after a severe defeat, fled to the hills. The report says that the number of garrison etc. killed is greater than that at Tarabah last year and the town is now in AJdiwans 1 hands. The ruler is a friend of the Eharif who will no doubt complain to Jeddah and Cairo although he is allegedalleged to have started the quarrel by Instigating Bin Marai, the ruler of 'Assir against the Idrisl and Bin Baud* Bin Saud is very glad of this.

Hasan, Indian Assistant Bahrein (on Deputation, Blyadh), to th® Political Ag@nt, Bahrein, I 'beg to report that just now, 6 A.M. a 'Bashir' carrier of good news arrived and is received,as usual, with firing of rifles (aT&gt;out 20 shots). His good news is, I gather, that the Ikhwan of the villages of SUIAINAH and Suwairiqiyah, * who had been sent out on a ghazu 'by the Imam ,, Bin Saud { my informer 1 s words g.uoted)against Bani AMullah,a section of Mutair, have gained a victory. The Ikhwan have captured the town, or village, of Bani Abdul lah (Mutair) called Al-Harrah, which is said to be near Medina, to the West of Medina, Purth^r particulars will be reported if given me 'by Bin Saud, P-S . From this and previous reports I have submitted, it will be seen tljfe Bin Saud has At the present moment no less than three ghazus, expeditions, out against Hejaa and Assir, I will submit fuller report as soon as I get sufficiently clear and reliable inforiiiation, which is by no means easy, as I notice every one is so reticent and few are allowed near us.V Copy of a mesBorandum He. t4-g, dated 1st August 1920, from Syed Slddlq. Hasan, K .3. , Indian Assistant, Bahrtln { on Deputation to Riyadh), to the Political Agent, Bahrein. I 'beg to report the following few facts which I hope will be found interesting On the afternoon of 1st August, when I was calling with Parhan on Bin Saud, I noticed unusual hustle in his naktah, office, where there were three clerks writing what seemed lists of things, and several persons coming in and, going out again and again, soiae coming up to Bin Saud and whispering something into his ear and rsceiving replies and orders in the same fashion - in whisper. I said { getting opportunity of one quiet moment which is, as you know, so rare when you are sitting with Bin Gaud who goes on rattling one thing or another withour stop ping to breathe, so to say) I said that I hoped he had received a reply, made up his mind and was ordering pre parations for HaJJ, Bin Baud replied that he was letting some of his men to prepare to go out and was ordering necessary supplies for them as he had received news that hah# Bin Haschid had already left/for the South. Briefly this means that Bin Saud is now preparing to send another ghaau, expedition, against ihn Baschid. it will prohahly he lead by faisal-ad^Dawaish. The previous evening i'arha Beg was present when Bin Saud called up a Badu and gave 11 - . . and the like aim a letter, spoke some words of oncouraganient/ and told with the letter hm to start ott tonedlately and deliver it to Ad-Dawaish with salaams. Bin &gt;aud was rather reserved this afternoon, but a few appropriate querries by me elicited this much more : Ibn Raschid had come down to a place (I forget name) whore there is good „ water and grassing for caaela, and shammer Badu a usually congregate in sum or ; it is situated on the borders of Bin Saud•s and Koweit territory ; the object is obviuosly4 ^meaning dou*bly naughty. He himself tells me he borrowed this name from a slave of theirs who was very naughty. As a 'boy he adopted this epi thet out of pride.ft ^meaning doubly naughty. He himself tells me he 'borrowed this name from a slave of theirs who was very naughty. As a boy he adopted this epi thet out of pride. * to try and retaliate the recent ghaau of 3aud Bu-Sharrain Bin 3aud f s son at 3huaibah t and also in response to Salem As»3abah f s requests and appeals for help : both were bent upon mischief, ^Sharr* t he knew positively, and being fore warned, he ou :ht to become fore-armed. Bin Baud went on to say that it was Aqab bin Ajil t the maternal uncle of Saud the late Emir of HAIL, who had usurped all authority at Hail f and who was following this hostile policy to wards him, Bin Baud, failing to realise that it would onl only be suicidal to them, as he was more than a match for them all put together, etc, etc. At this juncture Bin Saud showed me an annonymous letter (written in a good literary style, so rare now»a» days in these parts) infoming Bin Saud (with the highest imaginable compliments and many prayers quoted from the Quran) that both Bin Baschid and Bin Babah had Just sent letters to the Shareef ( King Hussein) through Salim 3ade ravi, a big Arab merchant of Bombay, bitterly complaining of Bin Saud^ acts etc. and asking for alliance and help. The writer wondered what the Shareef oould do at all for these 'poor heggers' and cursed them for their folly in making the request or appeal{ the anonymous writer must he some well-read person or Alim in Koweit, I think). I expressed surprise and said that such a thing request, if made, could he of little avail, but was futile. Bin iaud, who had hy this time returned to his usual flow or volubility of speech, went on to say that such were the habits of Arah Chiefs who would never rest or let their neighbours rest, but must go on quarreling a#d fighting robbing and killing. It was the duty of the British Government as a friendly protecting power to give serious attention to Arab affairs. He had expressed his views at great length in the course of his meeting with you ( Major Dick3on)and to late Captain Uhakespear and Mr. P hiT hy previously, also to 3ir Percy Cox himself. He had since been writing drawing His ajesty's Govern ment's attention from time to time to the unsatisfactoryu ' ' ■ ,11 (S&gt; * condition of the Jaairat-al-Arab; Taut nothing came out or it all. His representations */ere disregarded, his .tri end ship and goodwill, which prompted those sincere expressions of wishes, and true faithful advice, were all set at naught. He was now feeling disappointed, nay al most afferonted, as if he was put down as 'khafif'(lit, irresponsible) of little ii-portance, or 'Jahil', ignorant. It was quite clear to him that Govt failed to appreciate him, and to realize his position, while they liad mads Hussein 'bin Ali, that poor hegger with no qualities of the head or heart,'Kiskin, faqir, darwesh allazi ma induh aq,al, wa la induh aalh', the king and were trumpet- ting him all over the world as Al-Malik, Al-Kalik',the king, the king. Why did the English not see, he wondered that if there was any one in Jazir at al Arah fit to he styled. 'King', it was he himself, although within himself he was proud of being called Mn Saud, He could, if he wished, hecome the virtual king of whole Arabia, he who took his forefather's capital, Riyadh, hack from Bin teal Raschid, attacking it with only a handful of bhI forty camel-riders, 'Ttai arhain dhalul', and drove the lUrk from Hassa in circumstances which were known to the whole world. Perhaps he had been writing too much and too often, but he was forced by circumstances to do so. He knew (Jovem ent was very busy, but it could not be so busy aa not to return him one clear satisfactory reply to all his propositions. Here I interposed saying, I knew the wftole corres pondence and did not see what letters or communications of his remained un-answered ; everything was given immedi ate attention and passed on to higher authorities and back etc. etc. He said that as long as affairs were subject to refer ence between Bahrain and Baghdad and Cairo and London and Simla and London, mistakes are bound to occur, and reality of matters cannot be understood. Those authorities sit- ting at a great distance could not k&gt;ow the exact nature{£?) x or real Importance ot his or other Arabs' affairs. He would rather have Government appoint a sort of Arab Board or Oomittee of two or three High, impartial officials who should know all about Arabs and Arabia. They should o per ..nentiy stationed at a Central place, say, Bu shirs or aghdad, and fully anpowared to axaaine and decide all questions or disputes now existing or in future aris- ing between Arab Rulers, and their decisions should be accepted and enforced as final, allowing appeal to London in rare eases only. He concluded by saying that his was a fer cry which Government did not hear, but that he had nearly lost pati^oe, and only .n. saying that he would not tresspass upon British rights or interests, nor would he trouble thoae who are in treaty alliance with Oovemaant but short of this he must do as he might like to support Maaif and toe masses dependant upon him for full maintenance. To my mind he mmaInpatient of the control on him burning to expand and conquer for which he is fully equipped cing able to throw a mass of fiery zealots (his own creation* Ikhwans) on to any part of the country. As be says, he need not to move even an inch himself, b*t give the word, and Arabia will be ablaze, if there is a r«a*y, I believe it is only a suffioiantly enhanced sub- S iay for Bin sand, who is. in ^ humble opinion, worth anything.Oopy of a memo Ho» 15-C, dated th.a 2nd Au;^uot, 1920, from Khan Sahib 3yed Si&amp;dig.

I, accompanied by /arhan Beg, went to Bin 3aud imrasdiately on reading your letter and found Bin laud pleased with your reply accepting his proposal. Ho said I was fortunate to go to HaJJ, and that al though much time had Been lost in receiving the Rovt s approval, yet he felt very much relieved and ohliged to Govern ont, to Oolo el 3ir Arnold Wilson and yourself for this favourable answerto his late proposal. He then apoke abotit the general condition ofthe way the difficulty of travelling in this hot season and the general unfriendly attitude of the king of Hejaz towards himself and the people of i 'ejd. He said that the party would he quite safe up to Asherah on the border of ejd, but that farther than that we should have to rely on God and the Shareef. He remarked laughingly that we doubtless valued our lives sufficiently to care about the matter and ask Govsmment to persuade the Bhareef to provide escort from Asherah to Mecca. I would, therefore, request that if you agree with Bin Saud in thinking that an escort is necessary to take us further, you will kindly refer to the Oivll Com isslon- ; er, Baghdad telegraphically, and have necessary arrange ments isiade in this behalf. Bin Saud has fixed Thursday, the 19 th Ohil-Q.aadah {5th KKlalo?:cl920) for the departure of the ejd mission to Mecca. Further particulars, as to who will be in charge I^amber of* men etc. will 'be reported as soon as .fixed t In any ease ibefore I leave Tiiyadh, Wa will have to travel very fast to reach in time for the Hajj, It la gratifying to note tlmt Bin Saud told me definitely tlmt he will send the most concilliatory and respectful letters, with us, to King Hussein and Jhareef Abdullah, and will also send ;&gt;ome suitable prosenta, prohahly two thoroughbred mares t rfven in this interview, although he was in very good spirits and Jovial mood. Bin Saud made a few remarks of the nature already reported at length. He said he was doing all this for Govt♦ s sale©, and only to please His Majesty*s O-ovem ant. lie did not see nuch use in doing tMM this, hut he clung to hope that the lhareef would perhaps see the futility of continuing the quarrel. It was a pity the Govt, did not fully appreciate hi, or realise his position* He was not only belittled, but tied hand and foot and let to lie down. By their present policy G-overn- Bient caused a loss to theMoelves, to hiin and to Arabs. Syria and Iraq were up struggling to oust the English, ho on the contrary, only allowed more and raore rope to Arabs. They will soon become uncontrolable when Govt will see too late that not only (the British Govt), but Bin Saud is a great loser. Indepandant strength and power of lyria ad and Iraq, would only oan proportionate weakness of him,Bin Saud. If let alone ha could control them to the advantage of the British Govern ent, but if she does it herself, so mucli the better. Although he would not say in plain word;], it is . clear from these remarks as well as those already re ported that Bin Baud * 3 mind is exercised by the idea of bidding for the headship of Arab Bui rs, and more especial ly of being constituted or appointed something like a Bais or President of the newly bom Arab States of Jyria and Mesopotamia. He has not yet uttered the word Palastine as yet, as far as I can remember, in his half a do&amp;en long conversations of this kind with me.Ho hi; self gays that It la inponallila i'or Mri to rul® over the Araha of eaopotania, Syrin, etc, as he cannot tolerate their religious or social cuatoma or hahits for one nomont: nor can ho poasihly convorl. aXl. his ovn crest, unless it ware 'by general massacres of thousands of them, which ho declares to he unthinkable for him.

He expresses liveliest satisfaction at Faisal's discomfiture. His only regret ia that Syria is not coining under hands of British. He long ago expected Faisal would come to a'bad. end owing to his Anti-English intrigues, and his total unfitness to be a ruler. The Allies are lucky Faisal fell before he was able to do the full mischief he intended. He trusts.the allies will now pay the fullest attention towards Arab affairs in order that peace and quiet may once more prevail.

All the ohoioest requisitioned have, I am told, arrived today and all is ready for the journey which for want of time has evidently become still more arduous in itself. 'Tawakkalna ala Allah ,, , as the Arab says, we trust in God. The mere fact that we are going, a mission from Bin Saud to Bin Shareef,gives one immense satisfaction. To tell you the truth there was little hope of it as you will see from my last report of yes terday's date. It is also satisfactory to note that the Ifaib, Ahmad Thaniyan, is now distinctly better or more sober in his talk or opinions about the Shareef. He is, if I am not mis taken fairly promising and reasonable and will, it is hoped, make matters smooth. The schism or gulf between the two sides is terribly wide, perhaps too wide to be bridged. One can only hope for the best. As Bin Saud is not with us and it is only a Naib in the person of Ahmad Thaniyan, I have adopted Farhan Beg^ proposi tion of our own separate mess etc. The Imam is said to have ordered the general stores supplies etc for the party but I am buying some provisions and sundries, also a few abbaa. It will all help to give us a sort of independent character in the eyes of the Arabs and also be useful to draw ^en and get in formation. That interesting individual Ibn Shalhoob (who by the way is the son of a settlet in Riyadh from HALSB, Syria) comes and tells us just now that the Imam will 11 Send us armed 11 • This will be irony of fate; instead of having the whole Hejd pilgrim party un-armed for the satisfaction of the Shareef, we ourselves are to go armed• Of course any arms that Bin SaudSaud might give us will b© for the journey and intended for show, as usual* I have seen old Imam, Abdur Rahman, who, somehow, suooeed ed in shaking off his^piety and condescended to receive us both with more than expected courtsey. He talked of old Indi an Ulema, one (last and best known) of them being Faulvi Sid- diq Hasan Khan, who rose from the modest position of an ordi nary Aalim to be Chief Secretary of the last Begum of Bhopal, and laterly married the Begum, receiving as a necessary ad junct the title of Nawwab# perhaps the mere chance that I pos sess the same name as the late Nawwab Siddiq Hasan Khan of Bhopal, ensured a kind reception for me from this old Imam, who is, naturally a bigotted Wahhabi* Saud, the ledest son, favourite and heir-apparent of Abdul Aziz is a charming youth of 19 or 20 years. He is very affable and may be a near approach to his eminent father later on. He said, he would some day like to go to Wilayah (England) for a tour. Faisal is rather backward or too young to show any marked souls qualities. The rest are all poor desolate kmk - hopeless bigots, and foolishly disgustingly anti-foreign. Bin Saud is writing to Qusaibi to be quick with the light- said he had buoy in Ojair harbour. When I spoke to him he/ordered it long ago, and he was glad to learn that p.W.D.man was sent by you to survey. He will write to you on the subject. About our return Bin Saud has repeated -ly expressed the desire that we should come back via Riyadh; but I cannot say nor have I promised him. It will depend on circumstances. As it is the Journey to Mecca in this hot season and with so deadly a haste is as much as one can bear. Thank Ood, we are both keep ing fairly fit. Hope you are enjoying good health, ^e both very much wish to see you in Bahrein on our return.

The letter stated that, the Ikhwan killed 400 of the inhabitants and did not snare women and children. On reading this, Abdullah 1« said to have spoken to those present, expressing his disgust and horror sayinp* that this was not in Islam, that such brutality was not permitted in any religion, and that he feared the llrbwan will sooner or late ^ incur God's wrath. When visiting Bin Saud the?^ same afternoon, I waited to hear something of it, but when nothing was menticss ed. by him, I said I had heard firing of some BO shots early in the morning and wondered what was the matter. Bin Saud said, Oh, it was a trifling thing. A man has come with news of some Ikhwah Ghazu and auccesu over Ban!

Government would find to be a true prophecy sooner or later* I ao afraid that I a® becoming rather p^Mftaiao in report ing these remarks and the like; but I prefer to try and let you know all I hear, rather as much of the interesting talks of this interesting gentleman, as I can remember, and be reminded of by my companion, Farhan Beg, who is very helpful to me.Copy of a memo No. 18-0, dated 5/6th August,1920,from K.S.Syed Siddiq Ha.mn, Indian Assistant, Bahrein ( On Deputaita atlon with the Nejd pllgrlrrage, oaiap Riyadh), to the Political Agent, Bahrein# I beg to report that since the receipt of your letter of 27th July 1920 embodying Government's apnroval of Bin 3aud's proposal to send a mission to Mecca, although Bin Saud had expressed his satisfaction and pleasure on the Civil Oom- missioner's answer yet a tendency was noticed on his part to minimize the advantage of the proposed mission and for the great er part of severely criticizing and blaming (if I amy say abusing) King Hussein. The curious part of it was that Bin Saud did so in his private conversation with Farhan Beg and myself and at the same time repeatedly said that he had been telling hie people quite different tbat is wod things about the Shareef so that their feeling might be softened and the Hajj and a reapproachment made easier etc. He would not for two days (during 4 interviews) after receipt of the above reply of Olvil Oommlssloner appoint or declare uhom he was going to depute, nor the number of men he would send to Mecca. Under these circumstances I asked for a special inter view In the evening and accompanied by Farhan Beg eaw Bin .&gt;aud alone on 3rd instant. After ordlnanry exchange of inquiries afr,er health and comfort and usual olvllitlea, I said that I had teeen waiting to hear his orders and decision about the mission which he had himself proposed as the last resort and which on reoeiptr pf your letter on lat instant, he hai promis ed to despatch with us on Thursday the 5th Instant and that I should like to write and inform you of the definite decision etc. in good time. Bin Baud replied that he hadthe matter In view but that as he had bean telling us he did not see much use eto* I then asked for his kindness and courtsey to let me speak about the matter and he said 'Saram' that is -Bismillah' do so. I than slowly and cautiously reviewed the wholehistory in brisf of the differenoaa and deaputsa between him and the Shareef as x had seen the correapondenoe going on on this. Bin saud - King Huasein, aubjeot for the last 2 years own especially reminding him of his Jettera and communica tions submitted to Government through Bahrain pointing out that he himself had been inoe^sently and bitterly complain ing againet various alleged aggressive acts of the King of Hejaz who in turn had been squally frequently complaining of similar hostile acts of his. Bin Baud's, both had sought a remedy and he himself had submitted definite proposals} his proposals had from time to time been fully considered by His X0&amp;8 t Majesty's Government and at iaas three different courses seriously adopted or decided upon and then altered and modi fied only to meet his own wishes and convenience. ( 1 was,of course referring to (1) the meeting at Aden, (2) Bin Saud going at the head of hio people by land Jixd and nesting King Hussein personally at or near Mecca (3) Bin Saud sending a representative with a friendly mission to Mecca). I also pointed out that you (Major Dickson) and the Civil Commissioner Colonel Sir Arnold Wilson K.O.I.B., C.S.I., C.M.G., D.S.O.,&amp;c. had taken so much trouble in explaining matters to H.B.M.'s Qovsrnnsnt, making favourable recommsndations and generally furthering his interests in every way, practically making his cause their own, and that it would bo a great pity indeed if this latest proposal proved a failure. I must say that in this conversation my companion, Pai-han Beg A1 Rahmah, whom I m l instruited befors hand, took a very active and useful part In as much as he in his own rough and ready Arab way, practi cally convoyed the opportune threat ( in an affectionate man ner, using the words - la Mahfuz, Ta tawil al Omr, which so much appeal to an Arab mind) that if he dilly-dalayed at this last moment and the chance of Hajj for Najdis and of attempting a friendly settlement or negotiations with the Shareef was lost only then he. Bin Saud, will not/loss the sympathies of his power ful friends Col. Wilson and Major Dickson, but would seriouslyK offend His Majesty's Government, who had already exercised too muoh patienoe with hira, and pressed the Shareef to acquiesce etc. To this I signified ray agreeroent in suitable words say ing this was the time for hiis to prove to Government the bona fide of his intentions towards King Hussein and requests to Government• In short, the result was very favourable and Bin Baud declared that he had, as already promised to me on receipt of your letter on 1st instant definitely decided to send a friendly mission headed by one of the Saud (ruling) family. After a little more talking, he declared he would send Ahmad Thaniyan with a very small number of men and will, for the sake of Government, ¥7rite extremely conciliatory letters and send presents to King Hussein and Shareef Abdullah and that he could only hope that good will come of all this and he, more than any one else, loved peace and tranquility etc. He has ordered Ahmad Thaniyan to be ready to start atonce and make all necessary preparations. On the whole, I thinlr, this is a good selection as this gentleman is fairly well read and amenable to reason. He has been to see me twice and we have talked of our business. I think he will do well. The number going from Riyadh is now practically fixed up and comes to about 150 men, all Hadhar, the delegate being only Ahmad Thani yan, the others are only Hajis, We may be expected to be joined by about so many, possibly more, as we proceed. Neither Bin Saud, nor Ahmad Thaniyan, can tell how many will Hajj, but I gather the impression that the aggregate will not exceed a few hundreds, it may only be 300 to 400 men, as there is very short time left and only the hapny owner of a first rate riding camel can reach in time for the Ha,1j. It is the selec tion of best dromedaries that has delayed us« We are now timed to start on Saturday morning 7th August 1920 -21st Dhil Qaadah 1338, expecting to arrive in Mecca on 2ist August = 4th Dhil Hajj. The journey has, thus to be performed in great haste in the shortest possible time.I trust you will kindly inform the Civil OoroiniB- aioner, Baghdad to have necessary warning sent telegraphio- ally to Kis Britanio Majesty's Agent at Jeddah, Indian Poli tioal Officer, Jeddah, and His Majesty King Hussein in order to have the mis ion met at ASHERAH, as Bin Saud has desired.Copy of a D.o.Tjettar dated 7th August,1930, fron K• 3• ayed oiddiq Hatian, Indian Assistant, Bahrein { On Deputation with riejd Pilgrimage, caisp Daraiyah), to Mbjor H .H.P.

Although Huagain at variance attitude may be partly attri buted. to disinclination to take our advice he is 2 ! undoubtedly frightened by both HejdiB and his own Bedouins over which he haB little control. Tn view of bitter feelings between the two parties T think that he has every reason to be nervous. Chances of peaceful pilgrimage depends on to a consi- t» derable degree on his ability to buy off tribee and he canno do this unless he receives his subsidy. He has just telegraphed to me that his financial situation is various and a^ked for immediate advance of £.30,000. After consideration I consider eubfndy should be i granted but that it should be made his undertaking to fulfil guarantee demanded in your telegram regarding permission for , pil grime to buy food stuff tar return journey. I understand that there is a precedent for pilgrims from -lejd leaving their armn at Taif during pilgrimage and I think that this suggestion might be made to Bin ^aud. It would lessen the chance of trouble at Arafat. Native Arabs opinion appears unanimous in thinking Ibn Saud and the King will not compose their difference unless a High British official is present at their meeting. Both principals have asked for this and in view of their acute mutual antipathy it would be better if(? Tbn f^aud) came immediately after the pilgrimage and meet the King (?at) Taif under British auspioBS. If pilgrimage had (Tin the meantime) passed offB^cessfully it would be taken as a good omen for a settle- .cient.

He gives aome shrewd adviQe,and his ideas on events in Syria and of the people of Iraq oould, with profit,be passed on to our little Englanders in parliament, I think. I have not wired on the precis of this letter, as it con tains nothing of urgency. From my knowledge of Bin Saud, he, of course,i5 all in favour of England taking over the protection of Arabia as a whole, whilst such places as Mesopotamia and Syria he would like t/o see under a strong British Government. He has no use,whatso ever,for the present idea of gradually educating ur&gt; the inhabi- tants to rule themselves. According to Al-Qusaibi,Bin Saud looks upon such ideas with scorn, as being effiminate and unworthy of a nation like Great Britain. He entirely believes in the rule of forc e tempered with justice in dealing with the Arabs/. By nature the Arab,according to Bin Saud,be he Bedouin or'Hathar' requires always a big stick over his head,otherwise,he will, like the wolf,turn on you and endeavour to pull you down. The predatory and roving instinct of his fore-fathers is in the Arab blood,and he cannot get rid of it. With him life consists of swallowing up your weaker neighbour - in other ^ords,the theory of 'Survival of the fittest' is a creed not to be eradicat from the Arab mind,and the only antidote to it is the strong arm of a strong government (like the English),or of a tyrany from among themselves. Bin Saud entirely rejects the idea of repre sentative government in the case of Arabs. There is a lot to be said for Bin Saud'a ideas. Kours sinosrely, Sd/ H.R.P.Dickson. Bt. Lt.-Col.

MKMQHANDUlf I bog to forward, herewith enclosed, translation of a letter dated 15th Dhll Hajj (= 50th August, 19S0) to ray address. The contents being of ordinary nature, I have not telegraphed them to you. with compliments to the Deputy political Resident, Bushire ; /; J. ? f ajor, Political Agent, Bahrein. ■ * Gbpy, together with a copy of the enclosure, forwardedTranslation of a letter dated 15th Dhil Hajj,1358 (= 30th Auguat, 1920) from Bin Saud to the Politioal Agent i3ahrein After complimenta I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 50th Dhil Hajj, the contents of which' 'T have fully noted, especially that part in which you tell me the Turks have signed the Peace Treaty, and the Tfationalista have followed suit* This may be considered a piece of good luck for them, unless they are followed by misfortune once more. UtvJU As you are well^ware, I always invite and pive my views in letters, as I have also done with your predeessors. And I have also given you personally my ideas regarding the condition of the Arabs of the penensula, and the plans of their rulers. I also fore-told you all about events that have happened in Syria and Iraq (last February). Today I wish to add to what I told you before, and my ideas on same. Firstly. You have brought pressure on me to mal'-e peace with the Ihareef. This is, in point of fact, the worst possible thing that you could do (Akbar ghash li wa lakum), and I would like to emphasise that 3atan, who always deceives people takes lessons from the Shareef (in matters evil). Donot overlook or be deceived^ by the clever machinations of the Shareef. I ; tell you, he would not have been checked in I his methods, as he has been, had it not been for tte® things ;- (1) The mercy of God; (2) His dishonest intentions. Secondly, in the past I have onnosed him, and I tell you that if now I make peace with Sh^reef, not only will he have no confidence in my word, but I will have no trust in him, except it be under theatriotast (signed) treatiaa and agreeiaants* Should, again, I to the latter (i.e# draw up atriot treaties with him) and should he, at a later date, start anythinpr contrary to good relations (between the Govt, on one side, and myself and hira on the other side ) how can I be expected to betray his confidence. I will have to be silent, as neither ray reli gion nor ray honour will permit me to speak or act contrary to his plans. Such action on ray part would be pure disloyalty to Govt. Again, if he and I corae to terras, the road will be onened between our respective countries, and you are well aware that all important men throughout the Arabian world visit Mecca, the dhareef, continually interviews such, and fills their minds with wonderful ideas,about their religion and nationality which donot fit in with Govt's policy (i.e. he teaches them to be discontented against their rulers and would effect ray peonle apainst me). In fact, as I have stated above the 'hareef 1 s machinatforfatione ir are fajf reaching. There are sure to arise occasions when he and his 30ns will ask my help, and that of my people. If I,| then warn my peonle against him and donot help^ I shall be told by my subjects^How (fcs it that you first tell us you have become friends with the Shareef, and now refuse to help hlm ,, . Again, should he (3hareef) ever raisV a ques- /tion of 'DIN 1 ' (Jehad), there is sure to be a / cllfifsranoe of opinion between ua. Should I help him, I should be failing in ny duty to Hie Jfajee- tjr's Government, and to myself, i have na aonfid- enoe in the man at all. You (His Kajeaty's Govt) are now the cause of the state of affairs thatr l &gt;* . tr exists bstwesn us two. Now, thsrsforef, examine matters and consider what is best for yourselves. I have explained thinprs fully; I Ceel free of responsibility. Thirdly. Regarding the Shareef, and his allied Arab rul ers, namely Bin Rasohid, Bin Sabah (Sheikh of Koweit) etc., also their Bhiah friends and Alims, none, I warn you, will desist, in the the end, from fighting/British Government and her allies. Even should they keep up a peacable dis guise now-a-days, they are bound in the end to seize hold upon the first oTmortunity, however small of raisinp- trouble. For their belief is, that 'He who dips his pen even in an inkstand on behalf of Christian, that man becomes a Kafir 11 . T 7hat they believe is even greater than this, though they themselves are reality infi dels (Kafirs) of the first water (in the T * f ahhabi eyes). Fourthly. You, English, protect and ?ro about explaining to the Arabs that you are out to improve their condition in matters generally. If you are sin cere, the matter is a hopeless one (mushkil) (as you don't know any thing of Arabs Ken the other hand if you are acting for diplomatic reasons, I can assure you that these ideas of yours( will have no good result. No one knows what happens in this world. 'You must think of i some other plan if you wish to bring ease and ■ res^ to Arabs. Further, those people whom you talk about *as Arabs, namely the people of Syria, Iraq and others, all their affairs and doings are contrary to those of Arabs. The^' are neither Arabs by religion, nor Arabs by their acts. They have all that is evil and little of geed in theirnatures (Kathirin al harakah wa qalilin al barakah). These people have neither adopted the Divine Law (Shara) for themselves, nor that of a regularized Government. My object in stating the above is only by way of giving advice for the common good of all. Also I wish to throw responsibility off my shoulders* I desired, therefore, to speak, as I have done.Prom political Bahrein, To Civ3on Baghdad Politioal Bushira No. 1071 Dated 16th September, 19So. % * Bin 3a ud* writing on 4th Sent ember than Irs His Majesty* s Government for gift of o 5,000 / '- which he grate fully accepts.

Owing to the impossibility of getting them to England during the war and for severaJ. months afterwards, Colonel Hamilton had to deposit them in the -Zoological Gardens at Bombay* One of them, the male unfortunately died there* At the end of May last a passage was finally secured for the female and Mr # Millard of the Bombay Hatural History Society brought her home with him and deposited her in the Zoological Gardens, Regents Park* Both specimens were captured young and brought up in Ibn Saud 1 s garden at Riyadh. The habitat of the Oryx is the Great ITefud, on broad belt of red sandy desert which surrounds the Oases of Central Arabia* These animals are very shy and are rarely seen and are said by the Arabs to be 11 drinkless cattle'. Doughty, the great Arabian Explorer, had only heard of them* Sir Wilfred and Lady Anne Blunt were the first Europeans to see them in their natural home near Hail nearly forty years ago* It is alleged that an Arabian Oryx was brought to Europe in 1857 by Captain John Shepherd of the India House who presented it to the London Zoological Society* The Arabs call the Oryx 'Al Wathaihi', or wild ox, and all sorts of legends have grown up about them in Arabia and Europe. That| low e^a^ly like a cow and this may be the connection with the 'reem' of the Bible, translated variously as wild ox and unicorn - see Deutoronomy XXXIII-17 and Job XXXIX - 9 et seq # The Oryx is supposed to be the original unicorn as seen broadside it appears to have only one horn. If this is the case this is a living specimen of one of the(%^ heraldic supporters of the Hoyal Arms inroduoed hy King James I in substitute for the Red Dragon of Wales* The specimen now in London has a fine pa.ir of horns. Its 'body is white, the whole of the forelegs and the lower pa.rt of the hind legs are 'brown with white fetlocks.

You may certainly enquire from your friend ^hdul Aziz Al-^asaibi regarding the deht due to him and others from me. However, I have great hopes, in my friends the High British Government. Furthermore regarding the question of Bin 3ubah. If I heglect him, dist^yftance is sure to take place in territo ries Ha3a and ^alif and amongst other tribesmen, as you are ^ell aware they are &lt;jf different elements and the longer question is dela3/'ed the worse it will be for me. It has also been mentioned to me that he has approached the Tuwalah of Shammar and tribesmen of others of Shammar and others with the ytrtt evil intention of stirring up a moment. I am also preparing in like manner for a move from ray side to resist any aggression. I would now therefore request you to inform your Government of this. If any is u going to «•£ as a medium and settle the matter which is pending between me and Bin Subah then we should put aside all ideas of aggression and wait; if the matter is to be settled between me and Bin Subah direct, and the high Government does not wish to interfere, then I will have to decide how I shall T I act. 1 may however mention that neither/wish to fight Bin Subah nor his people but he on the contrary seems to wish to quarrel. My object is only to avoid the occurance of an evil and see to the comfort and tranquility of my subjects. I request you will kindly expedite the question in order that nothing serious may happen.

'Se ^rohuQ which .;ould have to be done every six nonths, and the buoy would also have to be visited monthly. The R.I.lI.Se »*Hearchus tf could not spare time for such visits as Q-jair is an out of thv way place and difficult of access. (2) Until the waters round Ojair have been charted , no vessels are likely to go there, so the Government of India would be very unjikely to sanction the '^earchus' takinn; on the Upkeep of a buoy rhic was serving no useful purpose. . ('') No Arab could tend such a buoy rs it is a highly specialised work, v (4) if despite these reasons you should still r/ish to pursue the subject of a gas buoy at Ojair, I will ascertain the views oi the Director, Royal Indian -arine on ,the subject. 4 No. J 7 g X O. 6 i he Residency, Bushire, 23rd September 20i A copy of the foregoing is forwarded to the Political Agent Bahrain Tith reference to his communic tion dated 4th June 1920 The delay in replying is due to the fact that the 'Nearchus' • went to Bombay and my memo no.982 dated 12th June took a long time to reach the Officer Oommanding. Please communicate the aist to Bin Saud. It looks as if a light buoy is impracticable at present moment, but you could liuorm Bin^ aud that in any case he can be quite sure that no \ steamer would approach Ojairat night.

He mentions having met Farhan A1 Rahmah and Ahmad bin Thanaiyan. actually these individuals reached jRiyadh Just about the time you, Philby and myself arrived at OJair; they started out for Hassa atonce, but were turned bacl r on receiv ing a message from din 5aud to await him at Riyadh. v (2) I am enclosing with this English translations of the three letters mentioned, sent to 3in Saud by Ahmad bin Thanai- ^ 0 yan from Mecca describing experiences I'wo addressed to Bin} Saud 0 of the Mission at Mecca and riving One addressed to me.} the personal ideas and views of King Hussein and his policy. .The letters are of interest. (3) It will be noticed that Ahmad Al Thanaiyan states that the Mission received no help in the way of rations for their camels all the time they were in Mecca. This is not quite correct aa according to Khan Sahib Byed Siddiq Hasan and Farhan Al Rahmah, the party did receive rations etc, though rather irregularly and after a rrood deal of delay and worry. (4) ain Jaud's idea in sending you a copy of the 'AL FALAH 11 is to show you that King Hussein mear\3 no good by His Majesty's Government. -All along, and especially in recent correspondence connected with the Jfe f jd Mission, Bin baud has taken the view that if he did patch up his quarrel with Sharif, he would only find himself faced with the pros pect of shortly breaking with him again (which it would be fe&gt; d*afl&amp;t fa {tad- ^! rvl Translation of a latter dated .'50th Muharrum 13^9 (=15th October 19*30) fron Din Baud to Political , Agent, iiahra in.

After a representative of the Sharif Husain bin Ali had invited me to be present to tall% I met the Sharif at his private or confidential room, where he started to talk to me after inquiring after our health and told me that we Arabs and our condition generally were in much trouble. 7e were now surrounded by 'Kafirs** (infidels)from every direction quite contrary to what the British- Govern ment and their allies had promised in their astreements which were made at 'San Remo'. You will see clearly also their double flealings in Iraq, and also in Syria and other places. I really found the old man's attitude quite contrary to what we and His Majesty's representatives had tauprht us was the case. In other words he was very anti-English, and I was greatly astonished to hear the things that passed at our meetings. I myself continued to reply ** Tea^s, yes** to his talk in order that he might continue what he was saying, and I found out what was in his heart. Among other things he said to me, 'I urge upon you immediately on your arrival back at Riyadh when you meet His Excellency Bin Saud to tell him to make an agreement with me and to act in the manner4*o- V I am acting with the powers and other Arab rulers apalnet thoee Engllah. Tell him I ahall help him financially and I ahall carry out all hia wiahea and deairea oonmletely.' I told him in reply that thia waa an affair which will bring about aerioua raaulta for the Arab peoplea and tor Your iSxcellency and furthermore my Hakin could not act against the wishes of Hia Majeaty'a Government on account of agreements and Treatiea concluded between the aaid Government and Your Excellency. These airreemsnta had to bo kent as long aa they were,firm to their word. He then became anrry and atarted ahakinp his head. I toll you the truth that he did not acrae with me, and I ahall not make peace with him. I told him thia waa an affair which was impossible and I then left him, although I waa still greatly astonished I wish to acquaint Your Excellency with thia conversation which took place between me and the Sharif in a nrivate and confidential manner for Your Excellency's information in order that you may know his real attitude.

After compliments. The object in writing this cordial letter is to enquire after your Honour's health. My condition will please you in every respect and nothing important has occurred which may be worthy of mention. As it is not hidden from your Honour I started from the capital Riadh accompanied by my honour able friendfc Khan Sahib Saiyed Siddiq Hasan and Farhan t Beg Al-Hahma and arrived at Holy Mecca safely and we performed our religious duties and observed nothing but good. After a few days when we finished our Httjj^we proceeded with our work. We had several meetings - twice with His Highness Husain bin Ali King of Hidjaz and seven timas with the representative body deputed by him and we arrived at last at an agreement ,which you will peruse from the copy which was given to the representatives of His Majesty's Governmentfi,e.Khan Sahib Siddiq Hasan and Sheikh Farhan Al-Rahma)latterly I became ill ,and ,as I ¥/anted help to return to Tfejd, I took Farhan with me . We could not start before to day .Whilst in Mecca several questions came up regarding supplies and stores etc.^and had to spend every day about £ 13/- to £ 15/- for fodder for our camels.This was on account of dearness and scarcity of same. We were expecting to get all this from His Majesty's Government according to arrangements which they made beforehandwe hov^ver had nothing done for us,firstly because of the absence of Khan Bahib 'Ajab Khan,secondly because of what Khalifa^ asiruidin said on the statement-of His Majesty's representativeat Jaddab Major flatton. The repraaentatl^ea of Hla Majaaty'a Govarnmant aont out by tha Govarn- mant of 'Iraq by order of its Civil OoromiBaloner who aooonmaniad na (K.a.giddiq Haaan and Shailcb Parhan) did not apara tharaaalvaa In trying \o gat things righted,hut Inanlta of all their offorta we got nothing axoept plain exouaea . On account of thaaa dlffloultlea I had to find a sum of about C 300/- although our stay at fToly Mecca ought to hava b-jman econonlcal one. Prom the above It would appear aa If the Government of Jeddah had no connec tion whatever with the Govamroant of 'Iraq . The object la not to ralaa a coraplalnt ;but to bring to notice a fact which la not good for the Honour of Hla Majesty's Government. I therefore conalder It neoaaaary according to our frlendahlp to bring thli to your Honour's notice aa the occasion waa a very Imnortant one before the ey»a of foreigners and to have a thing Ilka thla take place between the offl- clala of two Governraenta la not right( I tha Government of Egypt and India) at thla time of trouble. I,of oouraa ,did every thlnpr to afford eaaa and faollitiaa in tha praaenoa of your rapraaantativea who will certainly inforra you in datail.

Political Agemt,Bahrain.CQNFIDEHTiAL political Agenoy, Bahrein. No. 358-0• Dated 18th October, 1920 . To Bin Baud After complimen ts I have not written before to Your Excellency because there has been no news of importance to impart to you. I, however, now send you, a short summary of events according to latest telegrams* as you know Sir Percy Oox, Mr. Philby and I arrived back in Bahrein after a most adventurous journey in a rough sea. By God*a help all went well with us.As I expected. Sir Percy Oox^ arrival in Iraq has had the greatest effect for goo^ throughout the land. The news, of his arrival has spread abroad far and wide and has acted like water on fire.On all sides, I hear, the tribesmen are submitting. 1# The very latest news received yesterday was to the effect that bamawah had been relieved by a strong force from Nasiriyeh A1 Muntafik, and the small party of British troops which had been beseiged there since two months had been relieved. The Arab forces which tried to prevent them from doing so were defeated and scattered just outside the walls of Samawah. 2. From the direction of Karbala comes still better news. The Provisional Government which the Arab rebels had set up there surrendered in a body to the General Officer Commanding the troo-os which were marching against the city, xhe surrendered prisoners have been sent off to Baghdad to Sir Percy Oox. Doubtless he will know how to deal with them. 3. From the direction of Syria comes very little news indeed. The French are keeping their own council and donot allow much to get out. One thing is certain howev'er,The French have separated the province of Lebanon from that of * Damascue and have set up a special Government for the Lebanese, ^ with Beyrout as its capital. This has been done at the express desire of the people of Lebanon # In Damascus all the people have been systematically dis armed by the French authorities. 4. In Egypt. The High Government has been pleased to grant the Egyptians'entire control of their own internal affairs. The Sudan and Palestine which lie to the South and East of Egypt remain under British control. The Suez Canal Zone remains in y the hand of the High Government and a large force of troops will be quartered at Kantara and at Tel El Kabir. Troops actually in Egypt .?/ill be withdrawn to these places. Of Course the British High Commissioner, Lord Allenby, Wxll remain in Egypt to advise the Sultan and generally supervise matters. A British Officer will also remain in charge of the public Debt Department. All other British officials will be withdrawn from the public services unless the Egyptian Government express a desire to retain them. The general meaning of the reforms is that the High Government remains the protecting power, but allows the Egyptians to entirely ^ manage their internal affairs without interference. Zaghlul pasha is shortly returning to Egypt. 5. Regarding European affairs generally all is well. The outstanding feature is the wonderfull recovery of trade in England. On all sides one hears vastly of increased|^rosperity[arid^^a^^ 6. Regarding the Bolshevicks v It is definitely ascertained that Snver Pasha and Jemal pasha are in Moscow, each having been given a post under the Soviet or Bolshevick Government. Regarding Koweit events I am writing under, separate letter.

I have received reliable information that he has nroceeded to HAIL. There are many reports and ¥/ild rumours in this connexion but I donot liketo mention those until they are fully confirmed. However, I wish to know about his visit to HAIL, whether Govt. / have any information about it, or whether he has p^one by Govt's orders prenaratory to proceed to llesopotamia or to an^ other direction. Possibly, he has himself of his own accord proceed- \ ed in that direction, with the evil intent to stir up trouble, in which case i should know for certain, and be able to take necessary counter-measures. 1 like this information to be conveyed to the Hi^h Oo^- missioner only and donot wish it to be passed on to His Malesty'e Government at this stage, till I have fully ascertained its truth» The object of asking that this should be done with utmost possible haste is that I am afraid lest any thing serious should happen without my havinr informed you beforehand. But if you have the correct information about the visit then I placemy reliance firstly in God and then in His Britannic Majesty's Government. But if you have no information whatsoever then there is not the leastMoubt that he has evil intentions. The Second question is the financial aid*, ^ou are well aware that I have been repeatedly urging this matter uponyou for a long time, arrl at my Intarviow with my frlervt fUr Percy Oox, tha High OOBnlaaloner, I waa nror-ioeH that it should be settled soon, and that it should be sanctioned to my satis faction. This matter la of a very urgent nature, as my needs are very pressing. I would request your honour,therefore,to ascertain the real position, and whether the question is going to be settled now, and, if there is no confirmation of any eort, I beg you to inform me definitely, m order that I may know and make some other arrangements to meet my rresent urgent naQds.
