Jn the name of my King, and in the name of the peoples over whom he rules, 1 address you as follows :— • 2. Our military operations have as their objoyt the defeat of the enemy, and the driving of him from these territories. In order to complete this task, 1 am charged with absolute and supreme control of all regions in which British troops operate; but our armies do not come into your cities and lands as conquerors or enemies, but as liberators. n't* . , 3. Since the days of ll^lak^ your city and your lands have been subject to the tyranny of strangers, your palaces have fallen into ruins, your gardens have sunk in desolation, and your lorefathers and yourselves have groaned in bondage. Your sons have been carried oh to wars not of your seeking, your wealth has been stripped from you by unjust men and squandered in distant places. 4. Since the days of Midhat, the lurks have talked of reforms, yet do not the ruins and wastes of to-day testify the vanity of those promises ? 5. It is the wish not only ol my King and his peoples, but it is also the wish ol the great nations with whom he is in alliance, that you should prosper even as in the past, when your lands were fertile, when your ancestors gave to the world literature, science, and art, and when Baghdad city was one of the wonders of the world. 6. Between your people and the dominions of mv King there has been a close bond of interest. Kor 200 vears have the merchants of Baghdad and Great Britain traded together in mutual profit and friendship. On the other hand, the Getmans and Turks who have despoiled you and yours, have for 20 years made Baghdad a centre of power from which to assail the power of the British and the Allies of the British in Persia and Arabia. Therefore the British Government cannot remain indifferent as to what takes place in your country now or in the future, for m duty to the interests of the British people and their Allies, the British Government cannot risk that being done in Baghdad aff ain which has been done by the Turks and7. But you people of Baghdad, whose commercial prosperity‘ and whose safety from oppression and invasion must ever be a matter of the closest concern to the British Government, are not to understand that it is the wish of the British Government to impose upon you alien institutions. It is the hope ol' the British Government that the aspirations of your phdosophers and writers shall he icalised and that once again the people of Baghdad shall flourish, enjoying their wealth and substance under insti tutions which are in consonance with their sacred laws and their racial ideals. In llejaz the Arabs have expelled the Turks and Germans who oppressed them and proclaimed the Sherif Hussein as their King, and his Lordship rules in inde pendence and freedom, and is the ally of the nations who are fighting against the power of Turkey and Germany; so, indeed, are the noble Arabs, the Lords of Koweyt, Nejd, and Asir. 8. Many noble Arabs have perished in the cause of Arab freedom, at the hands of those alien rulers, the Turks, who oppressed them. It is the determination of the Government of Great Britain and the great Powers allied to Great Britain, that these noble Arabs shall not have suffered in vain. It is the hope and desire of the British people and the nations in alliance with them, that the Arab race may rise once more to greatness and renown among the peoples of the earth, and that it shall bind itself together to this end in unity and coneord. 9. 0 people of Baghdad remember that for 2C) generations you have suffered under strange tyrants who have ever endeavoured to set one Arab house against another in order that they might profit by your dissensions. This policy is abhorrent to Great Britain and her Allies, for there can be neither peace nor prosperity where there is enmity and misgovernment. Therefore I am commanded to invite vote, through your nobles and elders and representatives, to participate in the management of your civil affairs in collaboration with the political representatives of Great Britain who accompany the British Army, so that you may be united with your kinsmen in North, East, South, and West in realising the aspirations of your race.”</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000291_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B253</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000291</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B253</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Baghdad'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1917/1917</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-03-31T18:21:45</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (1 folio)</extent><extent>This file consists of a single document.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at f 122, and terminates at f 122, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
