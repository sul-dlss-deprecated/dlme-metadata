J Printed for the use of the Foreign Office. November 1905. d/3 CONFIDENTIAL. 8525.) Memorandum respecting Expeu British Consulates in Pers. THE Chancellor of the Exchequer has for warded to Lord Lansdowne a Memorandum on the expenditure on Consulates in Persia. In this Memorandum it is stated that, according to the settlement ar^V^d at with the Government of India in ont of G,000Z. per annum was to die Government of Lidia towards . and Consular expenditure in sia a^ j ; that this sum was ap propriated in ' 'matic and Consular Vote from 1901-1902 om ai is, and, if th ug, had remained in statu quo } would continue to ho so appropriated now ; but that, as a result of the changes in the Consular establishment in Persia which have been made in the interval, the 6,000Z. originally receivable irom liiu' 1 h;^ o ^fen converted in 1905-1906 \ n to a payment to India of 1,/06Z., and tha? U) besides this, we have now before us proposals which may involve a further payment to India of about 3,000Z, This result, is said tq 1 oe due partly— 1. To the fact that the Indian scale of expendi ture on salaries, allowances, &amp;c., is more liberal than ours ; and 2. To the increased interest which the Govern ment of Lidia have taken of late years in Persia and the Persian Gulf, and which has led to the establishment of new Consulates or increased expenditure on old ones. Ihe Memorandum has been forwarded to the Government of India by the India Office for their observations, and we may expect to have their criticisms of the figures as well as of the deduc tions which are drawn from them. But it may be useful to examine ourselves, [1123] (2 r:from the materials at our disposal, how far the statement of account may be considered to be correct. The account current between the Foreign^ Office and the 0 o.rernment of India for l o 605- 1900 shows a balance due to India of 1,7057 £ 18s. Gd. But this is not an indication of the actaial balance of credit and debit for the current year, because it is made up of payments Tme from and to India on account of expenditure in 1902—1903. More over, a sum of ab-^ut 3,5007., previously charged to the Governr nen f °f India in com otion with the Shah’s v^sit to Eng^'nd, and subsequently disallowed % ^em, is • * VA ucted from the sum due from Ttri dia. The I-ndian contributio i. 6,0007. is, further, subject a deductic i of 1,9007., in consequence of uie Government c India naving taken over the payment of all e oenditure connected with the Kerman Consulate but this reduction is due simply to a change o nanmal arrange uents, and not to increased e: diture. Leaving out of account the deductic ) for the Kerman Consulate and (b) for dii -ance o e certain adventitious expenditure, L ie ;unt fc * 1905- 1900 would show an amot i ol about 3,7007. payable by India, 1 t resulting froi . the expendi ture of 1902-1903 d not that of any subsequent year. In order to arriv a trustworthy estimate of the actual state of account between India and the Imperial Exchequer for Consular expenditure in Persia during the current year, the matter must oP exhimilbu by a different method, and the actual increases in the yE? r ly expenditure for the Consulates paid by the two Exchequers respec tively must be compared. The result appears to be as follows :- - £ Increased expenditure on Consulates paid by Imperial Government .. .. 3,815 Increased expenditure on Consulates paid by Government of India .. .. 15,143 Balance .. .. 11,328 of which half will be borne by the Imperial Exchequer .. .. 5,664 This will leave only a sum of, say, 3407. pay able by India. The payment for the Kerman Consulate will convert this debit balance info a credit of 1,5607. claimable by India, but this, asalready explained, is a mere question of transfer not of increase, and does not add to our Consular expenditure. The balance of account has, however, been further affected by initial expenses in the estab- 'lishmefit of new posts, such as the construction of the necessary buildings, and this cause must continue to operate, though to a less extent, in regard to expenses pf upkeep. Although, therefore, the statement of facts made in the Treasury Memorandum are, strictly speaking, inaccurate in detail, it is undeniable that the Indian contribution towards Diplomatic and Consular expenditure is rapidly disappearing in consequence of the increased charge for the Consular establishment in Persia. The assertion that this growing charge is due to the increased interest taken in that country by the Government of India, as distinguished fiNpra the Imperial Government, is scarcely sustainable, but is discussed in a separate Memorandum.
