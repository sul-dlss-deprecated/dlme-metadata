Its language is delibe rately insulting to Ills Highness the Amir 9 Abdullah and it indulges in sabre rattling - 'if we only had him to deal with, we should have settled accounts long ago'. 5. Before making representations to the Hejasi Government, X compared this article with the Arabic text and style of previous lf 0mia-al—4ura w publications and also made such local enquiries as were possible. As a result I came to the definite conclusion that both articles were written by Sheykh Yusuf Yaaln. My c cm elusion was confirmed by Mr. Hiilby, who has further informed me in confidence that he knows that they were written with Ibn 3a*(Id’s full knowledge* SO'me days before the publication of the second article, Mr. Philby was told by Fuad Bey Hamza of the intention to publish a reply to r-.eent defamatory statements made recently In r the press' - whether Trans-Jordanian, Palestinian, Syrian or Egyptian, Mr.Philby could not say - and attributed to the Amir ’Abdullah. hr.Philby was aS'ked to co-operate with messages to 111 © own papers. He refused, saying that he knew Hi© Majesty 1 © Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.'I knew nothing of the facta of the matter and that in any case iiC 1 ' or ion ^ decided to write nothing to the press about the HeJaz^Ilejd # since he had only severe criticiata to offer* As soon as he saw the article in question, he was the more * determined to have nothing to do with it* He was neverthe less summoned to Mecca on the mh October and again pressed strongly, this time by Sheykh 1 Abdullah Suleyman 1 © brother and a© a result, he was told, of a telegram from the King himself, to write a similar article for the European press* Ue again refused , giving his reasons, and took the precaut ion of telegraphing them himself to Ibn oa 1 dd* He received a reply accepting his reasons* I was not surprised, therefore, when I made formal representations yesterday to the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, to find that he viewed the articles with equanimity, even with satisfaction. I informed him of the strong exception taken to the first article in Trans-Jordan (Mr.Young'a despatch Ho.805 U of the i§th October, a copy of which was sent to the Colonial Office), and requested an ex planation of it and of the second article, which I was brings ing to the notice of His Majesty’s Clovernment* A serious view would, I thought, be taken of these outbursts in a semi-official organ. Fuad Bey denied that the ^mm-al-qura’ 1 was even semi-official or that its articles required official sanction before publication* When pressed, he admitted that he had seen the second article before it was published but he refused to take any official responsibility for it and refused to admit, though he was careful not to deny, that it was written by Hheykh Yusuf Yasin. He Justified the article as a proper reply to unwarranted attacks on the Hejas-Hejdi«-raMc press which were clearly inspired by the Jmtr 'hhduXlfth# Xf exception were tu&amp;en to the article, the editor of the * , Uiaia«-al-, v ura t ’ was the responsible person and could be sued under the Hejazi press, law* (a translation of this law was annexed to the Jedda Aeport for April 1929). ^fhile taking exception to this attitude, I did not ask for details of the alleged attacks, since I wanted to prevent the question from being drawn on to the plane of mutual press recrimination# Moreover, if the frans-ATordunlan or Palestinian press has contained such matter, it will no doxubt already have been noted in those countries. I there fore concluded by informing Fuad Bey that, in bringing the second article to Your Lordship's notice, I would report his attitude and state my conviction that both articles were the work of Bheykh Yusuf Yasin and had been published officially. He remained unmoved. 6* Fuad Bey is not normally so thick-skinned. I attribute his attitude to his knowledge that the king and Yustd Yasln are responsible and to his determination not to be drawn into representations which might prejudice his own position with the King in the present circumstances* these I have I already described in zay immediately preceding despatch. 7. On the other hand, I could not carry my repre sentations further without disclosing the information given to me in confidence by Mr#Philby* Nor do I know what the degree of provocation ha© been. I have the honour to request inst ructions a© to the form which the further representations which I judge to be necessary should take.
