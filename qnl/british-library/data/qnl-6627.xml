Translation of an Agreement with the Jam of Beyla, dated the 2Lst December 1861. \\ hereas it is in contemplation to carry on as far as India the communication now opened between Great Britain and other high States of Europe and Asia bv continuing the Line of Electric Telegraph from Constantinople and Bagdad through Persia and Beluchistan to Karachi, and whereas, in the prosecution of this scheme of universal benefit, it lias become necessary to take measures for the security and protection of the said contemplated line, the high Government of Bombay have deputed Major F. J. Goldsmid, for the special purpose of entering into such negotiations with the several Chiefs, holding territory between Karachi and Guadur, as may be deemed necessary for the due furtherance of the aforesaid undertaking. Now the line of coast from the Hubb River to Khos Kulmut or its vicinity, a distance of 240 measured miles, being within the Territory of Jam Meer Khan, Chief of‘Lus Beyla, the undersigned, Major F. J. Goldsmid, on the part of the British Government and with the knowledge and consent of its firm ally, Khodadad Khan, Ruler of the Sovereign State of Khelat, hereb} makes agreement with Jam Meer Khan aforesaid, for the construction, maintenance and protection of the Line of lelegraph between the above-mentioned places. The detailed agreement is as follows :— I. The materials for the line may be landed on any part of the coast between the Hubb River and Khos Kulmut, and all reasonable assistance will be rendered by the local authorities in ensuring its security and facilitating its construction, due payment being made for labour or articles supplied. IL There will be two telegraph stations erected for the residence and office of Signallers, one at Sonmeanee and one at Ormara. III. All individuals authoritatively employed in the construction, maintenance or use of the line aforesaid shall receive such protection and assistance from the local authorities as Avill enable them to prosecute their work without let or hindrance, due payment to be made for labour or articles supplied. IV. A sum of rupees 10,000 :: yearly shall be paid by the Political Agent at Kholat to the Jam of Beyla, on the understanding that he keeps up an establishment of not less than men, on salaries of rupees per mensem in the aggregate, for the due protection of the line, and rendering such assistance as from time to time may be required by the telegraph employes stationei on the coast. * The amount of yearly payment must depend on further reference as to the actual work required. But the undersigned is of opinion that the full sum may be double that fixed for the pay of a watching establishment here entered. For instance, supposing such establishment to be Rs. 330 per mensem, the yearly amount would be Rs. 3,960, of which the double would be Rs. 7,920. This would be estimated in round numbers at Rs. 8,000. A 24 Y Should it be authoritatively reported at any time that the said establishment is insufficient and such injury be done to the Line as would lead to the belief that due care was not exercised in its protection, the Political Agent, Khelat, will be empowered to call upon the Jam of Beyla to make such additional payment as will not exceed in the whole the amount of VI The annual payment to the Jam will commence from the date that five miles of Telegraph wire may be reported set up, all intermediate payment being made according to labour or articles supplied, as previously provided. YU Complaints against individuals in the employ oi the Lelegraph Department, not capable of satisfactory adjustment, will be referred to the Political Agent at Khelat; any cases of urgency, whether in the nature of a complaint or otherwise, affecting such persons may be referred to the Magistrate or Commandant of Police at Karachi as exceptional, should occasion require. . . . T • . „ , . VIII. Continued obstruction or injury to the Line may cause revocation of this agreement on the part of Government at any time. The agreement made between the parties hereto, as above defined, is to be considered dependent, for completion and effect, upon the approval of the Bombay Government. Sonmeanee ; &lt;Sd.) F. J.

In that case private Indo-European despatches _ shall be forwarded, together with private messages already deposited at the office, and in alternative order with those messages, whatever mav have been the hour at which the latter may have been deposited. VUI. The Convention of Brussels, of 30th June 1858, in all that relates to the details of the telegraphic service shall be mutually observed by the two contracting Governments, in so far as it is not opposed to the terms of the present Convention. IX. It is agreed between the High Contracting Parties that the rates for Indo-European messages sent by the Ottoman lines in Asia throughout their whole extent from Constantinople to Fao, or to the Persian frontier in the direction of Khanakain and vice versa, shall not exceed tire limit of '21 \ francs for a single message sent from Constantinople to Fao or vice versa, and of 22\ francs for a single message sent from Constantinople to Khanakain or vice versa, as also that the rates for messages traversing the whole submarine line from India to Fao, or to Busliire and vice versa, shall not exceed the limit for the former of 62| francs for each single despatch and for the latter of 50 francs. X. The administrations of the two contracting Governments will communicate to each other ■with the least possible delay the tariff of their stations and frontiers, in so far as they may have reference to the Indo-Ottoman frontier of Fao. According to that tariff the rates shall be mutually accounted for in the monthly accounts of messages exchanged between the two administrations at the aforesaid frontier of Fao. XI. The mutual account for telegraphic rates, expenses of postage, and of expresses. &amp;c. shall be checked at the expiration of every month and settled quarterly. The liquidation and payment of the surplus which may be due to either administration shall take place at the close of each quarter. The accounts of each administration shall enumerate only the rates in debit: they shall be drawn up by the Ottoman Administration in francs and centimes, the total beingreduced to shillings and pence; and by the British Administration in shillings and pence, the total being reduced to francs and centimes. The reduction of these sums shall be calculated at the rate of— 1 Pound sterling =■ 25 francs. 1 Shilling = 1 franc 25 centimes. 1 Penny = 10 centimes. XXL The balance which may accrue from the quarterly liquidation, in favour of one or other of the administrations, may be paid either in Turkish pounds, in pounds sterling, or in 20 -franc pieces.

All messages to or from India may be forwarded indifferently, as may be most convenient for the service, either by the line of Bussorah or by that of Khanakain. XV. It is well understood that the Ottoman Government shall be in account-current, and shall have direct administrative relations with the Government of India in respect to all messages, whether sent by the frontier of Fao or by the Persian route of Khanakain. Thus the two contracting Governments shall not be in account-current, and shall not have direct administrative relations with Persia except in respect to payment for those messages only which shall have traversed the Persian lines ; so that as regards Indo-European messages, the two High Contracting Parties shall only account to the Persian Government for the amount due to it for their transit along the Persian lines between Khanakain and Bushire. XVI. The present Convention shall come into operation as soon as the submarine cable shall be in communication with the land lines of Turkey and of India, and shall remain in force for three years from the day on which the ratifications are exchanged. Nevertheless, the High Contracting Parties may introduce into it, according as necessity may require, such modifications as may be considered by common agreement to be useful and indispensable. At the end of three years the present Convention shall be deemed to be in force for an indefinite term, and until the expiration of six months, reckoning from the date on which either of the parties shall have made known to the other its intention to put an end to the same. XVII. The present Convention shall be ratified, and the ratifications shall be exchanged at Constantinople as soon as possible. Done at Constantinople on the 3rd day of September 1864. (L.S.)

In case of insubordination or misconduct on the part of the Persian Signallers, His Royal Highness the Itizad-es-Sultaneh engages to use his best endeavours in lawfully supporting the authority of the English Superintending Officer, exercised under the last rule. On the other hand, the English officer engages that the bounds of that authority shall in no way be exceeded. 6 . The English officer shall have nothing whatever to do with receipts of money. AMirza will be appointed at each station, who will be directly responsible for the accounts to the Itizad-es-Sultaneh. But the English Superintending Officer shall render to his Royal Highness, or any person who may be appointed by the Persian Government, such account of the telegrams despatched under his authority as may be sufficient of full information. These rules, however general in some sense, are understood to have special application to the second wire. VI. In filling up vacancies, which may occur among the signallers employed under Article IV, the English Telegraph Officer shall give the preference to natives of Persia, provided they be qualified, in his estimation, by knowledge of the English language, and other attainments necessary for this service, to perform the duties required. VII. As the Telegraph Offices of these two wires ought to be distinct, the Persian Government shall build a new office adjoining the existing one, wherever there are not separate rooms. VIIL If any injury befall the second wire, or delay occur through press of traffic, the first wire, which is specially used for internal communication in Persia, shall give assistance to the second wire and vice versa. IX. For every message of twenty words or less from Khanakain to Bushire, or vice versa, one toman, five krans and eight shahis in Persian money, or 14 shillings in English money, 21220 Bshall be charged, with proportionate rates for the intervening towns. The Persian Govern ment accepts the tariff laid down in the last convention between Turkey and England so far as regards the rates of messages sent by the two Go\einments from Bushire to India and from Khanakain to Constantinople or Europe. X. The yearly receipts will be credited to the Persian Treasury, but should they reach a higher sum than thirty thousand tomans, the surplus will be made over to the otficeVs of the English Government for the cost of their establishment. XI. All Indian messages at whatever part of the line or from whatever place received shall be given over to the second wire, and the accounts regularly kept. XII. Should the traffic so continuously increase as to demand more than is in one day the fair day’s work on the second wire, the excess of telegrams shall be handed over for despatch to the first wire, the money received on them being separately credited to the Persian Government. The adjustment of this matter shall rest with the Itizad-es-Sultaneh and the English Superintending officer. This article is quite irrespective of the provision for mutual assistance in the event of a slight and temporary delay. XIII. The cost of all other than Indian or submarine cable messages shall be separately credited to the Persian Treasury, although conveyed by the second wire. XIV. The relative value of coin shall be calculated for purposes of account at the following rates:— ^ j • The telegraph accounts shall be made up by the English Superintending Officer ly and sent to Constantinople where, by comparison with the Cable and ^Turkish une pound sterling = jo rrancs = J'J krans. One shilling = 1 franc = '25 centimes = 1 kran = 2 shahis. One penny = 10 centimes = 2 shahis. As a rule accounts should be kept in English and payments made in Teheran in Persian currency. XV monthly v # l 7 ' r ~~ - ~ w v .» &lt;1IIVI x UJ accounts, they will be checked by the British Commissioner appointed for that purpose. On the return to Teheran of the audited accounts from Constantinople, the amount due to the Persian Government will be certified by the English Officer and speedily paid every six months,^ as stated in the last article. The above account shall always be open to the inspection of the Telegraph Agent of the Persian Government at Constantinople, or any person recognised by the Persian Minister at the Ottoman Court for the settlement of accounts of international traffic on the Persian-Turkish line. XVI. The Telegraphic Regulations drawn up at Paris on the thirteenth of April Anno Domini, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five shall be carried out under the superintendence of the Persian Government so far as not opposed to the terms of the present convention or the institutions of Persia. 1 XV1 l L ^ n y disagreement arising between the Telegraphic employes of the two Govern- ments shall be referred to their Excellencies the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the ] rQnou ii 8ter at ^ ieran ’ or ^ er ^ Ia f after necessary investigation, a just decision may be X\ 111. lids convention shall take effect from the opening of correspondence on the second W. re and remain m force for five years from the day that a telegram is first despatched ereby.

(Sd.) R. F. Thomson. XIII. Convention between Great Britain and Persia for the Supervision and Construction of a Third Wire from Teheran to Bushire, dated the 2nd December 1872. (Signed in the English and Persian Languages.) Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and His Majesty the King of all the Kingdoms of Persia, being desirous to continue the system of telegraphic communication between Europe and India, through Persia already established in virtue of previous Treaties, have resolved that a convention for that purpose shall be concluded, wherefore their Majesties have named as their Plenipotentiaries— Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Ronald Fergusson Thomson, Esq., Her Charge d’Affaires at the Court of Persia, and His Majesty the King of all the Kingdoms of Persia, His Excellency Mirza Syud Khan, His Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ac., Ac. And the aforesaid distinguished representatives after meeting in the Capital of Teheran and perusing and exchanging their full powers which were found in good and due form, have agreed upon and concluded the following articles:— Article I. lo expedite and facilitate the transmission of international messages, the English (lovernment will at its own expense and under the superintendence of its own officers erect a third wire, in addition to the two already in operation between Teheran and Bushire, and will also substitute iron standards for the existing wooden poles. The English Govern ment agrees to substitute the above iron standards at the rate of 5(X) annually ; and the Persian Government engages to pay in ten annual instalments the sum of 10,000 tomans to the English Ciovernment towards defraying the expenditure incurred on these iron posts. During this work the I ersian (lovernment engages itself to render the Superintending officers every assistance in its power of which they may stand in need. II. \\ hereas all British subjects in Persia are entitled to the protection of the Persian Go\ernment under the operation of Article XII. of the Treaty of Paris of 4th March 1857, it is2? 13 pul'nrdutles j!‘,in the Bnti v h era ? loy ? of , the ^^egrapli Department being charged with pubhc duties shall be everywhere placed under the special protection of Hie local authorises who shall furnish guards when necessary, and otherwise assure their personal ^tj' 111 , ' ntl1 t l(&gt; , com P letlon « f the third wire provided for bv the above \rt cle I the appropriation of the ex.stmg first and second wires for local and international n e ages ’shaU remam as at present, v.z., as regulated by Article VIII. of the Convention of the SXember IV. After the completion of the third wire, notice of which will be given to the Persian ^ folio' 3 ' Ct0r ° £ the English staff - the appropriation of thefhree wires shall be The first wire viz., the one set up originally in 1864, shall be used for local traffic while he fOT ^ exceptions herein- Administrations. i XJ* Should the first wire be broken at any time, one of the others shall be temporarily lent tor I ersian correspondence, until communication by the first wire is restored, provided always that both the second and third wires are at the time in good working order throughout their length, and free from contact. Should the first wire be in contact with either the second or third wire while the remaining wire is clear, the wire in contact with the first wire shall be insulated to allow Irc w oi king bv the I ersian employes on the first wire until the contact is removed. &lt;ci Should the fiist wiie be in contact with the second or third while the remaining one is interrupted, or should both second and third wires be interrupted ; or should all three wires at any time be in contact the resultant single line shall be used by the English and Persian Administrations in the respective proportions of two-thirds to one-third of the day, the exact hours to be fixed by mutual agreement between the English and Persian Directors. AIL Lhe revenue derived from the local traffic on the Persian wire shall belong entirely to the Persian Government. By local traffic are meant messages originating at one Persian station and terminating at another Persian station. \1II. I he Persian Government having already made an arrangement with the Indo- European Telegraph Company, regarding the revenue derived from the Indo-European traffic, the English Government will abide by that agreement so far as they are concerned ; that is to say, the Persian Government, in consideration of a fixed annual payment by the said Company of either 12,000 tomans or of two francs per message of 20 vrords, renounces all claims to any portion of the revenue from transit traffic over the line from Julfa (on the Russian frontier) to Bushire. This revenue shall therefore be divided between the English Government and the Indo-European Company in such manner as they themselves may decide, and the accounts between them shall be settled without the intervention of the Persian Government. As regards international messages originating or terminating in Persia, the Persian Government agrees to cede to the English Government, for a term of three years, the entire Persian terminal tax on such messages in consideration of a fixed annual payment of 2,000 tomans to be paid to Persia by the English Government. After the three years the Persian Government shall be free, either to accept an annual payment calculated on the basis of two-thirds of the average terminal receipts, or to claim two-thirds of the receipts from all bond fide terminal messages. The Persian Government agrees to leave it to the sense of justice of the English Government to decide which are bond fide terminal messages, and which are to considered as transit messages, being forwarded to Persia evidently for the purposes of being re-transmitted to other countries. During the time this Treaty remains in force, the Persian Government engages itself to oppose at the International Telegraph conferences any alteration in the present transit and terminal rates, unless a previous agreement with the English Government shall have been made. IX. The English administration being responsible for the correct transmission of all international messages and for the adjustment of the accounts, will collect the payments for these messages according to the rates of the prevailing International Telegraph Convention. All international messages originating in Persia shall, before transmission, be registered and sealed by officials appointed by the Persian Government. International messages terminating in Persia shall be delivered to tiie addressees through the agency of the same officials, who shall be bound to give receipts for such messages to the English Administration. The Persian Administration shall at all times have free access to the English offices and to all records connected with international traffic. International messages are those which pass over the wires of more than one State.x The maintenance of the line including repairs and the appointment, control and , nf t , ip line-cruards shall remain in the hands of the English Director and staff. As a contribution touards'the expenditure under this head the Persian Government will pay to the English Director the sum of 1,000 tomans annually this amount being deducted from the royalty due to Persia by the Indo-European Telegraph Company as hereinbefore described in ^tirle UIL the Telegraph Inspectors and Line-guards are strictly confined to repairing and maintaining the line. , , -n . i , If the line be wilfullv damaged, the Persian Government will take the most stringent measures to oblige the local authorities to apprehend and punish the offenders. The Governors of districts will be accordingly instructed to pay prompt attention to all complaints and communications made to them by the English officers. defraved by the Persian Government. „ , + , , ,, XIII To enable the English Director to have a perfect knowledge ot the state ot the wires and offices and thereby to provide for their general efficiency and the rapid removal of any impediment to telegraphic communication, the orders and regulations issued by him regarding the connections within the offices and tlm times and manner of testing the lines shall be strictly obeyed bv the Persian Telegraph officers and signalleis. XIV. It having been ascertained that the debt owed by the Persian Government to the English Government on account of materials and erection of the second wire, together with some items connected with the erection of the first wire and the payment of line-guards amounted on the 31st December I860 to tomans 115,079 krans 8, or 47,217 pounds sterling, the English Government agrees to accept payment without interest in the course of twenty- four years, in twenty-four equal instalments of the same from the Indo-European Telegraph Company. Should the aforesaid Indo-European Telegraph Company wish to pay the amount in question sooner, it is at liberty to do so. The English Government shall notify without delay to the Persian Government any instance of°failure on the part of the Indo-European Telegraph Company in paying the periodical instalments, and will then hold the Persian Government responsible for any portion of the debt remaining unpaid. Nothing in this article is to be considered to invalidate any claim on the Indo-European Telegraph Company, which the Persian Government holds in virtue of the concessions granted to the said Company. XV. All articles required by the English staff from abroad, for the service of the line, shall be exempt from customs or other duties in Persia. XVI. This convention applies specially to the Teheran-Bushire Section, but shall apply equally to the Tekeran-Khanakain Section, should the English Director, at any time, deem it expedient to resume charge of that portion of the Persian Telegraph. In such a case the tariff of the Tekeran-Khanakain Section, and the method of account shall be settled by a special arrangement between the English and Persian Administrations. XVII. Any disagreement arising between the Telegraph employes of the two Govern ments shall be referred for decision to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the British Representative at Teheran. XVI]I. This convention shall take effect from the day on which its ratifications are exchanged, and shall remain in force until the first day of January one thousand eight hundred and ninety-five, on which date the English staff shall make over the whole line, in whatever condition it may be at the time, including iron posts and third wire, to the Persian Government, and shall then cease to have any further connection with the Persian Telegraph. XIX. After the erection of the third wire, it shall be competent for the English Govern ment, at any time before the expiry of this convention, on giving six months’ notice, to hand over the line, in its existing condition, to the Persian Government, and to withdraw itsofficerb and employes from the country, ceasing from that date to have any further connection with the Persian Telegraph. NX. The ratifications of the present convention shall be exchanged at Teheran within five months, or sooner if practicable.

The Government of His Imperial Majesty of all the Russians having determined to connect their military commands across the Caspian with those in Russia by a telegraph line in conjunction with telegraph wire now existing in Persia, is desirous to construct a line for this object from Chekishler to Astrabad ; therefore the undersigned have agreed upon the following articles. Article I. The Government of His Imperial Majesty of Russia will at their own cost construct a telegraph line from Chekishler to the town of Astrabad, so that it may be there connected with the Persian Telegraph lines. II. The Government of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia sanctions the construction of that part of the line which may be in Persian territory between Chekishler and Astrabad. The Russian Government will previously inform that of Persia which route maybe chosen for that part of the line, and the Persian Ministers will then immediatelv grant leave for its construction. HI. I he Persian Ministers will not consider themselves entitled to anv recompense or compensation for the construction of that part of the line between Chekishler and Astrabad which may be in I ersian territory, and they also engage hot to claim custom duty for anv matenal or implements which may be necessary for the construction and keeping in repair of th is part of the line to be constructed between Chekishler and Astrabad. i ’ f ^ !l IUSle !

X. rhis Convention will be in force for a year from the day of its signature : after the lapse of this one year should the Ministers of the Persian ami Russian Governments both deem it suitable to maintain it or to make any changes in it this will be done. XI. After the completion of the telegraph line from Chekishler to Astrabad, the Russian Government will make over to that of Persia that part of the said line which shall have been constructed in Persian territory to be its own property. XVIII. Translation of a Telegraph Convention between Russia and Persia, dated 30th Safar 1298/31 st January 1881. As the Telegraph Convention of the 12/24th May 1879 contracted between the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Russian Legation at Teheran has expired, and the Ministers of the Russian Government wish to keep up communications with their military authorities on the East Coast of the Caspian Sea, the undersigned have agreed upon the following Article I. In order that the aforesaid communications may pass through without loss of time, the Persian Government engage to protect, as far as in their power, such telegraph wires of^ the Chekishler-Astrabad line as pass through Persian territory. In virtue of Article XI. of the Convention of the 12th May 1879, the lines which have been constructed on Persian territory have become the property of the Persian Government, who now engage to protect them and keep them in working order ; that is to say their “ exploitation, and horsemen who are employed to protect the telegraph lines will accompany the Russian telegraph employes on their inspection of these lines.” If. The Russian Government on their side engage to pay all expenses of repairs to the wires from Chekishler to Astrabad during the time that this convention is in force. The Persian Government also engage not to claim customs duty for any material and implements which may be necessary for the construction and keeping in repair of the said line. III. The Persian Government will give permission for stationing Russian telegraph officers at Persian stations from Julfa to Chekishler, wherever they may be deemed requisite for the transmission of messages in due order and without delay, and their duties and rights will be the same as those enacted in the Convention of the 12th May 1879. IV. For messages in transit between Julfa and Astrabad, and also between Russian stations on the eastern side of the Caspian and Teheran with the Persian Telegraph stations to the north of that place, in conformity with the arrangement of the 2nd April 1880, between the Governments of Russia and Persia, which is known in French as the “ Declaration,” the Persian Government is to receive 30 centimes a word, between Russian stations on the east of the Caspian, and the south of Teheran 60 centimes will be paid to the Persian Government. V. The transmission of all Government messages passing over Persian lines between Astrabad and Julfa will take precedence of all private messages from Persian telegraph stations, but not the official messages of the Persian Government. VI. In order that no delay should take place in the transmission of messages between Julfa and Astrabad the lines must be inspected and repaired, therefore the Persian Govern ment engage to set aside one-tenth of the amount received by Persia for messages in virtue of this convention, for the necessary repairs, and the Persian Telegraph Department shall expend that sum in making the said repairs, unless in the case of its being found that so large a sum is not required for the purpose. VII. This convention will be in force so long as the Russian Government requires to keep up telegraphic communication with its military authorities on the eastern coast of the Caspian and, when no longer necessary for such communication, the Russian Government will without delay inform the Persian Government of the fact.

English Translation of the Persian Concession of the 24tii May 1869. The conclusions accepted by the Congress of Vienna having changed the basis of the Concession of the 11th January 1868, granted to Messrs. Siemens and Halske and Siemens Brothers, in forcing the actual Concessionnaires to fix a tariff which is under the minimum of 100 francs, stipulated in Article VJH of the said Concession, the Persian Government and the Concessionnaires having agreed to the following articles :— I. The Persian Government concedes to the actual Concessionnaires for the period since the 1st January 1870 up to the expiration of the Treaty of the 23rd October 1865, all the rights that that Treaty gives them on the receipts accruing from international messages transmitted over the Teheran-Bushire line. After the expiration of that Treaty the Teheran-Bushire line will be made over to the Concessionnaires, unless the Persian Government has made, meanwhile, a new convention on the same financial basis with the English Government concerning this line. In case the treaty should be renewed, the Persian Government concedes to the Concessionnaires for the period up to the 1st January 1895, the date of the expiration of the C oncession of the 11th February 1868, all the rights which Avould have accrued to the Persian Government, and that the renewal of the Anglo-Persian Convention would have still given them on the two-thirds of the receipts accruing from international messages transmitted over the line between Djulfa and Bushire, the third part alreadv belonging to the grantees, as it is stipulated in Article IX of the Concession of the 11th January 1868. 1 he ( oncessionnaires will themselves collect the above-mentioned receipts and to that effect will arrange with the English Government. In return, the Concessionnaires will pay to the Persian Government during 25 years from the 1st february 1870 to the 1st January i895, at their option either a duty of 2 francs for each transit message which passes over the Djulfa-Bushire line, excepting service messages oi an annual rent of 12,000 tomans. They shall pay this duty or the fixed rent in the two cases, whether the Teheran-Bushire line be made over to them, or whether it remains under the existing administrative eonditions, the Concessionnaires then enjoying the revenue only which may accrue to the Persian Government and to themselves. Moreover, the grantees are prepared at the request of the Persian Government to pay all tie debts which that Government has contracted up to the present with the English21 The amount of these debts should be determined before the 1 st January 1871 hv Persian'Government' af&lt;&gt;re8a,&lt;1 Governments frum rent or the duties payable to In case the settlement of the account between the said Governments lias not mW,,, , at the date mentioned, then another term shall be fixed for this settlement-a te™ which k not to exceed one year.

The Concessionnaires are obliged to advise the Persian Government as to the direction of the line before proceeding to construct it. r 6 2. The Concessionnaires bind themselves to complete the construction of this line as soon as possible. 3. The Concessionnaires bind themselves to construct the line and to maintain it in good state of preservation during the whole period of their administration. The telegraphic wire shall be made of iron of the best quality, and shall be six millimetres at least in diameter. The supports shall be of iron ; the apparatus shall be of the best quality. \\ henever possible the stations shall be located at Shiraz in the offices of the Persian Telegraph ; m other places in such sites as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Conces sionnaires shall deem suitable, and which shall be gratuitously granted to the latter from land belonging to the Persian Government. 4. Like the lines already existing, the new line is equally destined for the despatch of international messages, which shall pass over the line of the Concessionnaires between London and Teheran. o. I he line 'will be considered as if it tvas an institution of the Government and will participate, under the relations of its organisation and of its security, in all the rights granted to the lines of the Persian Government. 6 . The Concessionnaires are exempted by the Persian Government from the payment of customs duty on the importation of materials for the establishment and maintenance of this line and of its offices, and they are freed from all local duties. The customs authorities shall however, have the right of inspecting the consignments belonging to the Concessionnaires on the frontier. 7.

The duration of the Concession is fixed at 25 years, to reckon from the day when the working of Shiraz-Bunder Abbas line shall have commenced. After the expiration of this period the privilege shall cease; and the Concessionnaires should come to an understanding with the Persian Government on the subject of the continuation of their possession of this line. In the case of no arrangement having been concluded on this subject, all the line constructed by virtue of this Concession, as well as the buildings of the stations, shall be given up to the Persian Government without any indemnity. 9. The duration of the Shiraz-Bunder Abbas Concession expiring after the 1st January 1895, the precision and rapidity of the international traffic which depends on the uniformity of administration might be threatened if the Government should take back, at this date, the Djoulfa-Teheran and Teheran-Bushire lines while the Shiraz-Bunder Abbas still remained, for some time in the hands of the Concessionnaires. • Paragraphs 1 to 10 of Article II. were subsequently annulled by the Concession of 1882. See Nos. XXI. and XXII.22 The Persian Government wishing to avoid this inconvenience, and being unwilling to take back the Shiraz-Bunder Abbas line before the expiration of this Concession so as not to be obliged to compensate the Concessionnaires lor the expenses ol constiuction lor which thev would no longer have any income, it consents to this that the Concession for the Djoulfa- Teheran line and the arrangement on the subject of the Teheran-Bunder-Bushire line be prolonged to the date of the expiration of the Shiraz-Bunder-Abbas line. 10. In return, the Concessionnaires shall pay to the Persian Government for the working of this Concession from the date of the opening of the line for international traffic during the first half of the 25 years 1,000 tomans annually and during the second half 2,000 tomans annually. If the Djoulfa-Teheran Concession and the arrangement on the subject of the Teheran- Bushire line are prolonged beyond the 1st January 1895, they shall pay, from that date to the expiration of the Shiraz-Bunder-Abbas Concession an annual fine of 15,000 tomans, instead of the 12,000 tomans fixed by Article I. of the present arrangement. 11 . If during the duration of the Concession the Concessionnaires put up extra wires to increase the means of communication, the Persian Government binds itself to pay to the Concessionnaires, when the line is given up, an indemnity for these extra wires based on an estimate made by a Commissioner of the Government and an Attorney of the Con^es- sionnaires. 12 . It shall be lawful at all times for the Concessionnaires to transfer the rights granted to them by the present Concession, with the obligations assumed by them, to another Company whose statutes shall have been sanctioned by the Government. It is agreed that the number of foreign employes along the whole Shiraz-Bunder-Abbas line shall not exceed 50 in number. III. The clauses of the former Concession of the 11th January 1868 remain in force so far as they are not modied by the provisions made above. IV.

XXIII. Agreement between Great Britain and Persia regarding the Limits of the British Telegraph Station at Jask (1887). (Translation.) With regard to the boundaries of the Telegraph Establishment at Jask, in accordance with the information received by the Persian Government and the British Legation, it has been decided as follows under date of the month of Jamadi A. H. 1304 (25th Februarv 1887). * That the Telegraph Establishment, which is situated at a distance of 300 yards from the point take possession of 600 yards more to the north of the Telegraph Establishment, i.e., 400 yards from the present boundary fence between which and the Telegraph Establish ment is a distance of 200 yards, making a total from the end of the promontory to the limits of 900 yards ; at the end of these 900 yards a wire boundary will be drawn and the Government of Jask shall have no right whatsoever on any account whatever to interfere in the interior of those limits. As the Telegraph Establishment well is about 1,000 yards distant from the boundary agreed upon, it is decided that the road and water-way from the well to the place where they meet the limits be protected and no one shall build upon, destroy or interfere with them; and for the preservation of the well itself it is agreed to set aside a space around the well to be walled in at a distance all round of 100 yards from the well. The customs and other buildings of the Persian Government Agent must be without the limits above agreed upon and be built on the place agreed upon between Mr. Ffinch 21220 D26 and the Malek-i-Tajjar. It is agreed that the Telegraph officials and their true, positive and salaried servants be exempted from Customs dues. It is agreed that stores for provisions and the necessaries of existence which are brought from the interior for the Telegraph Establishment, such as rice, ghee, wood, dec., and such like be exempHrom taxatmn.^v ^ dependents 0 f Jask, other than the true, positive and salaried servants of the Telegraph Establishment, in order to take sanctuary or protection penetrate within the limits, the Telegraph officials shall have no right to protect them ; on the contrary they should place them without their boundary and hand them over to the Government ° f ^Any merchant, native or foreign, who may have shops within the limits must pay the 1 A 1 ’ 1,/a Inaranrts: in nrflpr to tmdp 1)11 V OV Spll Any mercnani, nauve ui ^ *•* usual Customs dues on that which he imports in order to trade, buy 01 sell. ^ ' - Sd.) 1 That which His Excellency the Ameen-es-Sultan, Minister of Finance and of the Palace, has written is correct and is registered in the horeign (Mlice of the I ersian Cioveriinient.
