K.A. F.Expenditure in the Persian Gulf . I have the honour to refer to the arrangements which were made in 1930 in connection with the supply of funds for R.A.F. expenditure in the Persian Gulf under which you kindly allowed your Political Agents to provide funds for expenditure incurred by personnel of No. 203 (FB) Squadron, Basrah, when visiting the various W/T Stations. 2. You are no doubt aware that it has been necessary to reduce the personnel at Basrah and that the various duties have for the time being been transferred to No. 84 (B) Squad- f ron, Shaibah, and it is hoped that you will be able to con tinue the same arrangements for that Squadron. 3. It is however necessary for definite instructions to be issued to this squadron with regard to the financial arrange ments in the Persian Gulf and attached is a copy of the ins tructions it is proposed to issue regarding the control of finances at Bahrain and Muscat. A copy of the instructions have been forwarded to the respective Political Agents asking them if they would inform Air Headquarters if they have any comments to make thereon which would be to our mutual benefit before they were finally issued to the unit. 4. In addition to the procedure covered by the instruc tions drafted for No. 84 (B) Squadron, it would be much appre ciated if you could see your way to allow your Political Agents to make advances to officers passing througi in order that the bare minimum of cash may be carried. Unfortunately several thefts have taken place at the Bahrain Rest House and it is essential that whatever action is possible should be taken to avoid any loss of public money. It is of course unnecessaryfor me to say that such advances will be accepted by me and a remittance made immediately to the Accountant General, Central Revenues, Delhi for credit. 5. In this connection it may be stated that arrangements have been made with Messrs. Imperial Airways Ltd. to allow credit for the cost of accommodation and food at their rest houses in the Persian Gulf and all adjustments are made by me with their Baghdad Office. This of course will reduce the advances necessary to a minimum. 6. To enable you to review tne position, I am attaching a draft of the instructions it is proposed to issue to all units in this Command, if there are no objections from your side.Reference c 57B7 /4/32//I /bA.
