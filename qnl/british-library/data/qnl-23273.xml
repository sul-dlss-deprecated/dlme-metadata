D.0.i5o:G/503. Political Agency, Bahrain,the 11th November 1933• Mr dear G-astrell, Would you kindly let me have a note saying exactly what took place between you and the Steeles 1 or Ham over arrangements for the Ham-Savidge marriage# 2. I received an invitation in the name of Mr and Mrs. ?iLB.Steele to the wedding which closed 'and afterwards at The Agency',though no invitation can properly be issued to a reception at a Residency or Agency except in the name of the Resident or the Political Agent. Did the Steeles T receive any authority from you to issue the invitation in their own names to the reception in ?he Agency? 3. I found also that it was apparently intended that Mr.Van Peursem should hold a marriage service m the Agency, although he has no powers of marrying a British subject in Bahrain,and that he should sign the register as 'Officiating Minister' (which Prior had let Mr.Pennings do,though I cannot think why). 4. There seems to be an idea that he has some powers of marriage (to which his conducting a service m The Agency would have lent additional colour),and 1 had to make it perfectly clear to all concerned that,in the case of British subjects,he had no powers of marriage whatsoever. b. Neither ^estion was pressed to an acute stage as fortunately the repairs to the Court Room made the Drawing Room unsafe,so the reception was given in the Steeles* house and Captain E.H.&amp;astrell,I.A, Secretary to the Honourable The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.2. r and the service was held in the Church. Mr.Van Peursem did not come to The Agency for the marriage. 6. Ham told me that you had informed him that the Political Agent could not perform the marriage (as Registrar) outside fhe Agency. He may have been mistaken,but if not, was there any reason for your saying so,as the Act and the Bahrain Order-in-Gouncil do not seem to limit the Political Agent so long as he is within his jurisdiction as Political Agent^. Possibly,however,you said so because Ham had notified 'The Agency' as the place of the marriage. ?. I am sorry to worry you,but I wpuld like the record to be clear. Yours sincerely, ID. 0.

This arrangement was naturally with my permission as it was at my invitation. At that time it was not certain whether Miss Savidge,as she was then,wished to have a religious ceremony or not,and i§ so, whether she would prefer it at the Church or at the Agency. I was not consulted as to the wording of the invitation which i received about a fortnight before the date contemplated for the wedding. It was then too late to bring the omission or error to the notice of the Steeles even if we had considered it important to do so. 5. It was fmlly intended thet Mr.¥an Peursem should conduct a marriage service in the normal Church of England form at the Agency. The form in which he was going to sign the Register was not discussed with me. It was understood that he would sign as one of the witnesses and there is no limit to their number that I know of. if. The fact that this ceremony by Mr.Van Peursem was insufficient in itself v/as well understood by all, for had he the authority to marry a British Subject,the Civil ceremony before the Marriage Registrar would surely not be heeded. 5. I am sorry your drawing-room floor was unsafe as that must have made the entertainment of the Admiral and the Political Resident quite a problem.page 2 . 7 6. As at no time was it contemplated that the 0TVIL marriage would take place except at the Agency,the question of the Marriage Registrar 1 s jurisdiction did not arise. During the many talks over the arrangements it is very prohahle that I Bsntioned the Consular rules regarding marriages and how they fiiffered in certain points from the Indian Act. A Consular marriage has to 'be performed in the Consulate mentioned in the marriage Warrant and 'between certain hours and with 15 open doors'!. The Indian Act has no such restrictions as far as I remember,and the whole affair is much simpler than the Consular one. It is quite possible that the jurisdiction (bf the Registrar is that of the Political Agent. Jc 9 lit. Col. G*. Loch, I. A*. The Agency, BAHRAIN./(iv) .

S# The circumstances of the case are briefly! as follows:- (i) . On the 6th January 1j36 Mr# Caetan Francis Tellis, a Portuguese clerk in the employ of the Bpyal Navy, who had been in Bahrain for about nine months, gave notice at the Agency that he wished to marry Miss Bridget Mary Fernandes, a British subject, who had just arrived from Bombay to marry him,' Both parties were of full age and there was no impediment to their marriage. Both were members of the Church of Rome, til). It transpired, however, that Miss Fernandes had not obtained from the Registrar in Bombay the certificate required under Section S8 of the Act. Jae had, there fore, either to obtain the certificate, which would have taken some time or to reside at Bahrain for one month to bring her within the district of the Registrar of Bahrain, that is to say, the Political Agent* She decided to adopt the latter course, (iii), In the meantime the Senior Heval Officer in the Persian Gulf had given a passage to Bahrain in H,M*S Shoreham to the Reverend Father Lawrence L&amp;«|), Order of the Disca-ced Carmelites, in order that he should perform the marriage,2. (iv). B&amp;hrain has alv.ays been regarded for the purpose of the Indian Christian Mg^riage Act as analogous to an Indian State under Section 6, so that no Minister of any denomination can solemnize a marriage of a British subject unless he holds a license from the Governor General-in-Gouncil. Ho such licenses have been issued and, therefore, no one can solemnise the marriage of a .British subject in Bahrain except the Registrar of Marriages, that is to say, the Political Agent♦ there is, hov/ever, local precedent for an ecclesiastical service being performed after the formal marriage by the Registrar. (v). The Heverend father ^amb held that from the religious point of view the marriage of any two members of the Church of Rome by a Priest of that ^nurch was a valid marriage, and in due course on the 11th January 1936 (before the njarriage had been performed by the Registrar) he proceeded to carry out the wedding ceremony of Mr, fellis and Miss Fernandes according to the rites of his Church# (vi)• In due course, after Miss Fernandes had become resident in the district of the Registrar of ferriages in Bahrain, Mr. Tellis and Miss. Fernandes were married by the Registrar, that is to say, the Political Agent, on the 6th February 1236• S, The situation thus arose of Mr, Tellis and Miss Fernandes having been married in the view of their iriest, though according to the Civil Law as interpreted in Bahrain, they could only be married by the Registrar• I had previously explained the local position to the Heverend Father Lamb, v*ho thus performed the ceremony knowing that he was committing an offence against the Indian Christian Marriage Act. 4* Had X been sure that our interpretation in Bahrain of the Indian Christian Marriage Act was correct, I might have pointed out to the Reverend Father IiaiBb the penalties in^osed for infringing the Act# But apart from this doubt, I cannot find any penalty laid down for a Minister of Religion who solemnises a marriage in spite of not having the license re aired by Article 6 of the Indian Christian Marriage Act. In all the circumstances, therefore, I contented a^self with drawing the Reverend Father uamb 1 s attention to the fact that, for exaaple, should he carry out his ceremony and Mr. Tellis /diedie before the Registrars ceresDny could be perforised, any child born of the marriage would suffer in the British Earire the disability of bastardy. The Reverend Father Lamb, however, regarded his cereioony as constituting a iaT/fui marriage and lr. Tellis held the view that as he 'was a Portguese subject and proposed eventually to reside in Goa, the legal bastardy in the British Ismyire of his possible child would be of little consequence* The Heverend Father ^amb, however, promised to advise these aeabers of his flock to conform to the require ments of the Civil La. , I, therefore, resigned siyself to seeing Hr. lellis and his fianc4e living in a state of civil sin for some weeks. Indeed, as I did not wish (a) that there should be any appearance of a Church-State conflict, (b) to disclose. lay doubts about the interpretation of the Indian CTarittian Marriage Act, or (c) that there should seem to be any prejudice in my aUnd against Hr. Tellis, who had recently been convicted of assault in the Agency Courts, I attended inforaially the cereisony performed by the Reverend Father Lamb, 5. The first oint on which a decision is required is whether Bahrain has properly been regarded as falling, for the purpose of the Indian Christian Marriage Act, under Section 6 of that Act which ?/ouid require the Minister of Religion to have a license granted by the Governor General-in-Council. 6. If our interpretation is correct, the Reverend Father Lamb transgressed the La?/. In that case, he should be liable to a penalty, but, as stated in paragraph ^ above, it does not appear that the penalties laid down in Section 68 of the Act would apply to a transgression against Section 6 of the Act. 7. If our interpretation is not correct, and if Bahrain is to be regarded as British India, it a pears that any person /mentioned// 4. mentioned in Section 5 of the ^ct may solemnize marriages of British subjects in Bahrain, but I venture to think that such a position in Bahrain is open to some objection as Bahrain is an independent MuhamiBedan State and it is particularly desir able, in Tiew of our special position here, that no difficulty should arise over the marriage of a British subject, such as, for example, that quoted in the next paragraph* I would add that the Arabian Mission (Dutch Reformed ^hurch) have always accepted our claim that only the Registrar of Carriages (!•©., the Political Agent) can perform the actual marriage of British subjects in Bahrain, though they have also performed a service in their Church afterwards on a number of occasions# In any case they would e pear to require a license under Section 5(s) of the Indian Christian Marriage Act as they do not receive episcopal ordination# 8. A possible solution of the difficulty in the seventh paragraph above would be for the Governor General-in-Comicil to give a license to the Heverend Father ^amb under Section 6 of the Indian Christian Marriage Act* But if this were to be done in his ease, it would be difficult to refuse to grant similar licenses in other cases# The Clergy of the A r abian Mission might ask for a license, but I should prefer that they should not have licenses, as in such matters their evangflcal zeal is apt to outrun their discretion, -^'or example, they recently urged upon me the marriage of a young Arab woman with a British Indian subject, but did not te.1.1 we that she had recently got into trouble in her village# I naturally made enciuiries before solemnising such a marriage and, as it happened, discovered the truth# fortunately, however, the Bahrain Government were able to inform me that the relations of the girl would not make trouble# /Licenses5. licenses might also be asked for by the Eevereiid Father iamb's colleagues in Basrah, one Spanish and tv/o * Iraqi Priests, whose coming to Bahrain might not always be desirable. 0. If our interpretation of the Act is correct, it seems hardly possible to let the matter pass, as if this lapse is overlooked it will be impossible to prevent other marriages, in some of which the parties may not also conform to the Civil Law, by Ministers of the Church of ^me, and it follows of other denominations. X should be grateful for orders as to what penalty can be enforced in such cases. 10. If no other suitable penalty can be invoked and if a warning does not suffice, I would suggest that the %nister, who proposes to offend against the 0 ivii Law might be pro hibited from being within the limits of the Bahrain Order-in- Council under Section 31Ci) or (if the circumstances so developed) deported under Section Ci)• I have the honour to be ^ir. lour most obedient servant.

Sir, / I ^have the honour to enclose herewith copy of a letter Ho• 0/139-13/2 dated the 28th March 1936, from the Political Agent, Bahrain. £• Since Bahrain is not an Indian State and since under King f s Hegulation No. 3 of 1922 the Indian Chris tian Marriage Act (XV of 1872) has heen made applicable to Bahrain it would appear that it is Section 5 of this Act and not section 6 which is relevant to the case under consideration (see paragraph 5 of Colonel Loch's letter). 3. If this view is correct then there was no need under Section 6 (l) for the Bevereod Father Lamh to hold a licence in order to perform the marriage in question, since he is an episcopally ordained memher of the Church of Kome, 'both parties were Homan Catholics and one of them was a British Bubjectt the Act was made applicable in Bahrain to British subjects only. the carriage was, therefore......* x therefore^ in my opinloc, valid and s'aould be registered at the Agency, if this has not already tieen done.
