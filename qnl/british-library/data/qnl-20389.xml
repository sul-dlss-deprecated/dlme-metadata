(2) Am for the e-ueetion of the forte, our position in thie matter is well known to you and to the British \ CovemMent, Bince theae forte are the original cause of wo at or the rerrettnble incidente which have taken place on the frontiers. An for Your Excellency 1 ® statement that the use of the forte h&amp;o been clear Xy shewn, in that they were the eane of preventing attacks in their neighbourhood, it im true in one een^e, but not in another. that no attack has happened in their vicinity* 2 » vicinity is ocrroct, but that they were the means of preventing the attacks &amp; net correct* ^or you doubtless knew that when fereee niarehed laet year te attack the forte mod thm frontiers, we rsent certain people after then who broui^t them back, in the hope that the problem would he solved in the course of th® conversations which it vm» expected to hold ith ¥our Excellency, -hen they eat out this year for the frontiere with the eajaie Intention we ourselves went after the aggressors and dealt then a decisive blow w^ich prevented thc-^i frets reaching the »Iraq frontiers. But, as we have already verb liy informed Tour .xcallency t if the ♦Iraq Government believe that such forte will protect them against tie Arabs of Bajd f we can decline all responsibility regarding any aggressiejt that my occur against 1 Iraq on account of these forts or others, and then the 1 Iraq Government will defend themselves with their forts, We believe that an expert would not consider such forts as conferring rm advantage so much as li ving brought harm, and. likely to do still more ham to iiajd and ♦ Irat, This ie the point we wish to explain, just as we expect our friend the General to do his beat to put an end to ny harm that my arise because of them. (5) As regards Captain Glubb and his activities, we have always believed that the bo activities on the frontiers, with the harm that has rami ted and will still result, to aajd and * Iraq, were not carried on with the knowledge of the British Dovernment, If sueh activities have been carried on with the knowledge and conaent of the British Government, this is a matter for much regret • o us ana we are convinced that the British Government does not fully appreciate the consequences of such activities and conduct.

It would appear that it would be more satisfactory if the cars were purchased in BAGHDAD and the Guns fitted by us as arranged with the Shaikh at the Conference held at KUWAIT on 23rd June. As His Excellency is no doubt aware, Sir Robert Brooke Popham was anxious that a condition of supplying Guns should be that the Shaikh should send a few men for training by the Royal Air Force free of charge. Although this condition was not agreed to at the conference on 23rd June, I am of the opinion that it should be strongly pressed for. I consider it most unlikely that there are any men in the Shaikh's Entourage who sufficiently understand the mechanicism of a Lewis Gun to correct any failures that may take take place. Lewis Guns and MountaiS® are available for issue as soon as authority is obtained. Sd. C.S. Burnett, Air Commodore, Air Officer Commanding,, 'Iraq Command# M. I.p Secret.

I agree that the procedure proposed by you is the best for bringing the Royal Air Force promptly to the help of the Shaikh of Kuwait if he should need it to expel Najdi insurgents who come v without his consent^into his territory. 3* It is possible however, when the * Iraq desert tribes next move into Kuwait for grazing, that raiders from Na.jd may attack them as they did during the early months of this year, thus necessitating once again taking advantage of the authorization given by the j)~S/ Shaikh of Kuwait (vide Kuwait's telegram ITo.459/S dated the 30th of September, 1928, to you). In such circum stances intelligence of the raiders movements might reach Zubair or Sufwan before Kuwait and unless action was taken at once it would be difficult to protect the threatened 'Iraqi tribes or punish the raiders# Await ou fopreference to Kuwait would probably rob the Royal Air Force of their opportunity.

Subject a - irahib ibn Shuoiairletter to Bin gaud on subject of raid on « Iraq shepherds (Bani Malik) outside Kuwait in March 1929c in reply to your No.278-S dated 15th July 1929, I have the honour to report that I called on His Excellency the sheiMi this morning and after doing my best to translate the garbled Ibn Shuqair's letter back into Arabic for him, asked him what he thought about it. 2, I might mention that the English translation of the letter as forwarded is not easy to follow, whilst most of the names mentioned are not recognizable. 3 C g?he point of the letter,however, was clear and I explained ttat Ibn Shuqair had made out that firstly he the Sheikh of Kuwait had informed the Akhwan that the Khirsan section of the Bani Malik camped near Kuwait was fair gp.me and could be raided^ and secondly that after it had been raided^ he the Shaikh of Kuwait warned the A^wan to get away with all speed., as Colonel More the political Agent had telegraphed for aeroplanes to bomb them. 4, sheikh Ahmad,who expressed a desire to see the original,was very indignant at tbe contents of the letter and angrily re marked 'This is one more instance of Bin gaud's hostility and determination to do everything in his power to discredit me the Ruler of KU-wait. quite recently we have had him sending to the British Government paisal ad-DUwish's letter to the Amir saud accusing me of supplying money and arms to the rebels; on this Sir,-2' g) occasion the attack: is more subtle. I am now supposed to be 'shown up 'as a person who has dealt crookedly with you English,, as well as having played the traitor to a poor little Arab tribe which sought toy protection. She last accusation is especially unworthy, as Bin Saud above all men should knew that the greatest slur and disgrace known to an Arab is to 'let down 11 a man who has made 'dakhala', or camped next door to him with the special object of getting protection. JX Bin gaud has any feelings of respect for me, how is it he did not send ad-DUwish 8 ! letter direct to me and ask: me for my comments o How is it the letter of Ibn Shuqair is served up in June to the consul in jeddah, and to me in July when the incident in question happened j in March 3rd, 1929. How is it you English keep on accepting these deliberate attempts of Bin Saud to discredit me iwhen all^&gt; Arabian world knows he has sworn to g*in control of Kuwait and turn me into a of his. Surely more direct and concrete j accusations against me would be more honourable. But these attacks, I fear, are part of the man's nature, and will not cease. Believe me, Colonel Dickson, I know Abdul Aziz better than you do, he is preparing Sw another campaign against Kuwait and more and more letters similar to the above will be produced ; some real some forged. l'ask you not to forget what I my and I ask you to warn His Majesty's abvernment what to expect' * I have tried to reproduce the Shaikhs own words to show how strongly he felt on the subject. 5. His Excellency next proceeded to narrate the following version of the story which he assured me ( H bil Koran al-Sharee# were the ti* true facts. 1 give his story in the first person for conveni en ce. (a) Howards ti® middle of February 1929 both Ibn Shuqair and ibn Hathlain acting under direct orders from b ^ 11 Saud entered Kuwait territory and hiding themselves in the 'Dibdiba* 1 south west of jahara commenced a game of pouncing on any stray shepherd tribe, both of 9 Iraq and Kuwait, whom they could conveniently mop3 ' j up. ^hey resembled a paok of wolves working from rather inaccessible bad lands and cut is ing off sheep that strayed from their flock. (b) Both my scouts at jahara and Captain alubb., who with the main body of the 'Iraq she pherds was some 4 hours North West of jahara, were aware of the existence of the raiders &gt; but their actual whereabouts was hard to determine owing ^to its being winter. (c) About this time the Khirsan section of the Bani Malik (suq esh ghuyeikh area) comprising 4o tents were grazing round jahara with the flocks of the jahara villagers. Fearing lest these and the outpost troops of 70 men whom I kept there should tempt the Akhwan, I sent stringent orders by my cousin Abdullah bin jabir to prevait anyone grazing out of range of the jahara fort* I also arranged for 3 groups of scouts to be sent out daily 8 miles in the direction of the Dibdiba* (d) Hext came the request from the Kirsan lead ers to the Political Agent and me that they should be allowed to come to Kuwait, as they felt they were unsafe at jahara. By coming to Kuwait, it must not be thought that they desired to camp inside the city walls, for this would have been impossible with their large flocks of sheep who had to find graz ing. gphey wished to camp 3 or 4 miles west &lt; of the city where the grazing area begins , and at the same time be under Kuwaitis pro tection. (e) Khowing that the Kirsan* s sheep would be a particular attraction for the raiders, I sent back a special messenger (after dis cussing the matter with the political Agent) that they, the Kirsan would be far safer with the remainder of the •Iraq shepherdsi and under the direct protection ot captain (Eubb., and I warned them that they should move at once,and ordered my jahara contingent to see them safely as far as Captain Qlubb # s camp .o (t) About this time my jahara scouts reported the raiders presence close to jahara fort waiting an opportunity so to speak to pounce. Feel ing anxious and remembering the sudden blow at jahara by the Akhwan in shaikh Salem's day, I ordered my Amir at jahara to collect all the villagers into the Port, including the Kirsan, the sheep remaining under close guard in the vicinity. (g) 2he Kirsan however chose to take the view that their flocks would be sacrificed on the first alarm and to everyones dismay left for iCiwait 18 miles away, a slow mass of sheep donkeys, women,impedimenta etc., an entirely s vulnerable mob. Having arrived within 4i mile of Kuwait they solemnly camped, there being \ e no more grazing closer into th^s city. Here they remained in spite of several urgent warnings from me about their extreme danger« One may here ask how it was I the Shaikh of Kuwait could not provide a sufficient cover ing force from the fown to protect these people.c My reply is that 1 could only muster 60 armed personal guards (fidawis) in the city and these could not hope to compete witl5 a strong raiding party of Akhwan^ It should | be clearly realized that today one Bedouin Akhwan is a match for 20 townsmen (Hathar) , at any time and at any place - this is a yyvA^- sad but true fact, as far as we Kuwait subjects are concerned. 3?he enormous pres- i tige and morale possessed by the Akhwan has only to be seen to be understood. My ,l HathaI' ,townsmen would have been quite useless for #uoh work as protecting anyone, outside their walls, muoh less guarding a small shepherd encampment 4 or 5 miles away. Remember my townsmen are shopkeepers, who can be trusted to turn out on an alarm and maga the walls nothing more. So ask such men to leave the protection of their walls and move out of the city would be asking too much, they simply would not obey c (h) ou the 3rd March and whilst I was still hoping t o get the Kirsan back to Jahara and on to Cap tain c ^Lubb before disaster overtook them, the blow fell in the shape of a dawn attacks She political Agent and I- did our best and we perso nally with other prominent citizens went out in cars and brought in the survivors., women-j child ren and wounded; much has been written on the subject-, so there is no need to describe the fight. Sufficient to say that the Kirsan, saS fought stubbornly and gave as good as they got, but they lost pretty nearly everything. (i) As the raiders retired south I sent my chief scout and shikari Qharib bin jasar with seven other fidawis in two cars to follow their tracks. Shis was not difficult as the captured sheep moved slowly. Oharib who is a Rashidi (Rashaida tribe), exchanged shots on three occasions with the party in charge of the stolen sheep. On the third occasion he recognized one of the men who was firing at him as a Rashidi. He called him to come and talk.

'j #' &lt;f74 cie^4s f Thank you for your letter of the 4th of July enclosing an interesting summary of Dickson*s views on the complaint made 'by the ^Iraq Government of the seducing of ^Iraq tribes by Ibn Sa^ud. I cannot admit his contention that Glubb is the author of the trouble, more especially as the Dahamshah and Dhafir had begun to go over to Nejd before he was appointed to his present duties. Further, I find that the case against Ibn Sa'ud is clear and that he has undoubtedly been acting against the spirit - if not the letter - of Article 4 of the Eahra Agreement, to be said for Dickson's general contention that the advance of regular government into the desert areas is viewed with apprehension by the shaikhs of the big nomad tribes, as leading to inevitable changes in their traditional mode of life and endangering their personal power and prestige. There is a school, to which I fancy Dickson belongs, which holds that the 'desert' should remain the 'desert' for all time. I am afraid I do not hold this view. It is true that there has been no change for many hundreds of years, owing to Turkish and other lack of administrative On,the other hand, there is no doubt much ability- 2 - ability or inclination, 'but times are changing and the steady march of regular government must in the end 'break down the old order. Itn Sa'ud himself is statesman enough to see this too and, although he protests that the desert posts and other admin istrative measures in 'Iraq are contrary to all the traditions of desert life and can only lead to disaster, he is all the time pursuing himself the policy of endeavouring to settle his Bedu in colonies and townships and thus secure an admin istrative hold over them. He is handicapped by lack of funds and an unproductive country but, nevertheless, his policy - as more than once explained to me personally, in moments of confidence is to try and control the nomads the establishment throughout his dominions of strong and prosperous centres of sedentary life.

Sir, I have the honour to report the following incidents which go far to show that Shaikh Ahmad is doing his utmost to carry out HiB Majesty^ Government's policy where the insurgents are concerned:^ (a) on the 2oth July Shaildi Naif ihn Hathlain (AlD^ul Kilab) Shaikh of all the Ajman, came to the Southernmost village of the ^usur (about 17 miles away) with a couple of servants. He wrote in and asked if he could come into Kuwait on private business. Shaikh Ahmad did not reply but sent a verbal message that he should make himself scarce on pain of arrest. 2?his he dido (b) on the evening of the 28th Jjily, naif al Fuqm brother of the ''al-puqm' 1 with 3 men, appeared outside the city of Kuwait, and sent in to say he was sick and wished to see the Doctor (a lie no doubt), shaikh Ahmad refused him permission to enter the city and ordered him to leave. Baif instead of doing so^removed his head-dress, put on common garments, and as an ordinary foot-passenger entered by the w Braisi ,r gate near the Shaikh's palace, and made his way to Hilal al-Mutairi's house. Hearing he was there Shaikh Ahmad who was at the time entertaining al-Qosaibi to dinner, flew into a rage and sent and ordered him out of the Down and across the border immediatelyo Shis in spite of the fact that Hilal had prepared a feast for him'.Regarding (b) above., HUlal alr-Mutairi is laiown to you welland. of course his sympathies ctre with the insurgents. He arrived in Kuwait about 15 days ago., in my opinion to pro- pagand in favour of the Rebels* Though I have no proof whatso ever of what I say., I should not be surprised if Hilal was not a ohief supplier to the rebels of dates and rioe. These he would send from his property near Fao by dhow^ not from KUwait city, and this incidentally show another method whereby the rebels can get supplies. Shaikh Ahmad has ordered that any more rebel leaders who turn up in KUwait, are to be arrested and sent to the Agency* I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant, political Agent, KuwaitGQNFIDMTIAL .

He is now engaged in formulating proposals that will he acceptable to him, vis^a-vis Bin gaud, and these when ready will he submitted to you by post. Needless to say His Excel lency reiterates his earnest desire and willingness to co-ope rate loyally with His Majesty^ Government at the present juncture and in particular to do all in his power to deny supplies to the Hassa insurgents. 3 # jn the meantime-, as I have had the opportunity of discussing the question of the relations between Kuwait and Nejd with His Excellency on many occasions lately, and from all angles, I venture to submit below some of the conclusions I have arrived at, as well as some of the principii causes which have led to the estrangement of relations between these two states, in doing this I realize that I am largely giving the Kuwait point of view, as explained to me by the Shaikh, but then I presume this is what is required if we are to get at the root of the trouble. ^ J desire especially to lay stress on the fact that both the Ruler of Kuwait and his people honestly believe they have been unjustly treated by both His Majesty^ Government and *mm\by Bin saudc They have got it firmly fixed in their heads that because Bin gaud was a big and strong person and one likely to give trouble,. His Majesty ! s Government sacrificed the interests of their small principality on more than one occasion., by fa vouring sin Saud to the detriment of Kuwait, in particular they believe that in order to get Bin gaud to agree to the present r iraq-NeJd boundary line at the ojair conference of 1922, His Majesty^s Government unbeknown to the Shaikh of Kuwait presented Bin Saud with a large slice of Kuwait *s southern territoiy.,thus depriving them, the Ruler and people of Kuwait, at one blow^not only of that portion of Hassa and north-east Nejd territory which shaikh Mubarak had acquired and consolidated in agreement with the Turks and Bin Raschid-, but also depriving them of their sole line of defence, the powerful tribes of Mutair^Alwa, (al-»Dooshan), Ajman and Awazim, whose habitat lay in the ter ritory in question,, and who had to go with the 'lopped off territory'. 5 e ijhe above point of view, and the fact that the Shaikh of Kuwait ia no way desires to take up an aggressive attitude but rather takes up the attitude of one fighting for his very existence, may be of assistance to you in putting the matter before His Majesty*s Government. gphe actual causes of the dispute between Mejd and Kuwait, may be divided under two heads. (a) The arbitrary fixing of the present Kuwait southern boundary at the Ojair Conference of 1922 as mentioned in paragraph 4 above when the Ruler of Kuwait was not present A. to fight his own battles, even though his adversary Bin Saud was there; the natural result being the present emasculated con dition of Kuwait state. (b) The Blockage of Kuwait by Bin gaud and the consequent present state of ruin which Kuwait finds herself in. 7 # as regards (a) I do not propose saying much, beyond the fact that His Excellency the Ruler and all persons of any standing in Kuwait stoutly maintain that the southern boundaryof Kuwait, in shai&amp;h. Mutoarak^s time started from Dohat Balbul on the sea (80 miles south of the present boundaiy, and passing through Hta, jariya al-sifla (included), jariya al-ilya (include ed) , Wabra (included), Safa (included), met the satin at Hafar (excluded). From this point the line turned North-East and joined the present South-west corner of Kuwait boundary at Um el-Bamir. This southern area enclosed the whole of the Ajman tribal area and that of the Mutair Aiwa (Dooshan) . in this connection it may not be amiss to mention that Safwan, jahara and Subaihiyah are all considered to belong to the Mutair Aiwa still. As regards the Awazim, their habitat was further north from (^usur to al-gooda (al-Makiita) i.e. the strip along the sea to East of Subahiyah, wafra and Hamadh. She contention also of the Ruler of Kuwait is that this southern boundary line was approved of by the Q?urkish authorities when they were masters of Hassa and it was only in Shaikh Salinas day that Bin saud started making claims against Kuwait^ and then only because of a personal feud between the two men, which ended in Shaikh Salim building a fort at Balbul which threatened jubaii (ainain). 8. it is interesting to recall that Bin Saud at the Ojair Conference never laid claim to any part of Kuwait ter ritory as far as I recollect (I was present on the occasion) , he claimed instead to be the chief of all the 'Badia' i.e. bedouin tribes of Arabia, and as such,where Kuwait was con cerned^ he demanded that the Ajman, Mutair and Awazim should be considered to come under his control. g?he first two of these tribes had already been pursuaded to Join him through the Akhwan movement, so, as Bin saud said, they were his alreadyc AS for the Awazim, these had been forced to go down to Hassa Just before Shaikh Salinas death, by Bin Baud's threat of attack and destruction^ but had not become Akhwan and if allowed would return to their Kuwait allegiance. Over the question of this tribe much heated argument took place, and speaking from memory I think that Hin saud agreed to allow it to return to Kuwait if it chose to do so of its own free will, it never did; Bin Saud saw to that. 9. According to His Excellency the Shaikh, he was faced■* 4 - Ivy- with 'a fait aooompli ,r on the return of Sir peroy Cox from Ojair, the latter only then informing him that his Southern province had gone to sin Saud together with the Mutair and Ajman, and that his 'boundaries for the future were to be as they exist today. []?he Shaikh relates how he protested to Sir peroy Cox, and getting no change remarked 'I suppose you have given my territories to Bin Saud because he is the stronger and has the big sword'. Sir Percy Cox laughed and replied,'Yes, but someday things may change and then you will be able to regain what you have lost and more',. Uhis is of course Shaikh Ahmad r s story, and he tells it as an amusing reminicence and adds 'the sword conquers today in spite of anything you English say'. leu I trust it will be realized that i am quoting shaikh Ahmad^s point of view above entirely and have consulted no files or books of reference-* fhe point I wish to make is that with the transfer of the Awazim, Mutair and A J man, Kuwait has been rendered absolutely defencelessc Shese tribes know her every weakness and her well, and as Akhwan under Bin s^ud have grown to look upon the A walls of Kuwait as the lilnit of their sway, (and Bin saud has encouraged and fostered this idea to the best of his power). lie Ehis brings one to a still more interesting point and one which concerns us closely at the present moments I refer to the policy of getting the Shaikh of Kuwait to invest in a fleet of light lorries armed with Lewis Guns for his defence. Though the shaikh has expressed his readiness to do the needful, he has confided to me that he has no faith at all in the scheme, for he knows that his own Kuwait townsmen who will have to man the cars will never make fighters, and as he admitted sadly to me recently, 'not 50 cars manned by my townsmen will be of the slightest use if attacked by the Akhwans* All they will be able to do will be to police my territories and deal with petty raids' ..personally I fear Shaikh Ahmad is not far wrong in his estimate of the 'riffraff' whom he calls his 'fidawi' 1 forces. I cannot see the car scheme becoming a success until he either gets one of the above tribes back, or imports European or Indian mercenaries to man his armed cars* The immense prestige which the desert Akhwan have today vis-a-vis the townsmen of Arabia has only to be seen to be understood. It can only be compared to the Afridi of theI -6- frontier and the Calcutta Babu. 12. As regards (b) the Blockade. Eight years ago the Customs receipts for the port of Kuwait amounted to over Ea 6 lacs per annum, this with an uniform charge of 4 ^ ad valorem custom (iity to loday these have dropped to Bi li lacs, and Kuwait is on the verge of ruin, with empty bazaars and shops, and an air of desolation everywhere c What has saved the town from going under altogether, has been the pearl trade, thoughliiis is far from being in a healthy condition. Bin Saudis policy of Blockade, a seemingly cruel and unnecessary act, which Kuwait has been too weak to resist has been and is the cause of this state of affairs« 13« The story is as follows;- After his success at Bahrain, when Bin gaud won his victory seven years ago in the matter of transit dues, he turn ed his attention to Kuwait, and in the reign of the present Ruler wrote him a letter and pointed out that he was in need of more money and had decided it was time to tax goods going into Nejd from Kuwait« He therefore proposed to the Ruler three alternatives to enable him to accomplish this endc .!I?hese were either (a) that a custom official of his be allowed to open an office at the exit gate of the city and collect revenue from cara vans leaving for Nejd (whether tribal or ''Hathar') or (b)that Shaikh Ahmad should appoint such official, and send the takings to Riath. or (o )that Shaikh Ahmad should send him Bin Saud a lump sum annually^ equivalent to what was considered a fair revenue (sum not fixed). 14. shaikh Ahmad declined to entertain any of the three above alterant ives on the grounds that in the eyes of the Arab world, it would be tantamount of his becoming a 'vassal' of Bin Sauds. He maintained the attitude that Bin Saud should adopt the ordinary methods as understood by the nations of the world and place Customs posts on the frontier line. He there-fore made the following oounter proposals to assist Bin Saud, though as he says he felt in no way bound to do thisiflfc i — (a) Bin Saud to build a line of customs posts anywhere along the frontier he pleased, and if these was a question of water difficulty^ such posts could be erected a short distance inside the frontier line, e.g. Subahiyah. He Shaikh Ahmad to give full facilities for the rationing of such posts from Kuwait town* (b) The 'manifest' system to be adopted on all goods going to Nejd: i.e. every ca ravan to be given a statement of the goods it exported, a second copy being retained in Kuwait by the Ruler and a third copy being sent to Bin saud aonthl^ Shis system would insure that any caravan that attempted to evade a customs post on the frontier would be caught on arrival at Nejd and be made to pay full custom duty as well as fine o (c) Should Bin saud desire it, the political Agent, Kuwait, could countersign eveiy out-going manifest as well. (d) She Shaikh of Kuwait for his part to assist by eveiy means in his power the levying of 2iikat on any of Bin. Saud% tribes should they be grazing in Kuwait territory and allowing,if necessary, Bin Saud's officials themselves to work: with his men for the purpose. 15« fo the Shaikh's proposals Bin Saud turned a deaf ear,, his only reply being that they were unacceptable, and therefore he was reluctantly compelled to forbid by force all intercourse between Kuwait and Nejd., either by his merchants or his tribes men, or by Kuwait merchants and tribesmen, in other words he besieged Kuwait and has continued to do so for the past &lt; years.in the beginning he was content to have so oalled bodies of bloolcade troops roaming along the frontier, summer and winter, but finding leakage took place and his policy did not bring A- the Shaikh of Kuwait to his knees, he adopted in the last four years more forcible methods in the shape of letting loose Akhwan raiders and Bedouins masquerading as police under his officials into Kuwait territory, to prey on all and sundry; in fact to raid anything they could find, up to the actual walls of Kuwaito 3?his move resulted in many people, subjects of the Shaikh, being killed and thousands of sheep taken. The wretched shaikh Ahmad whilst refusing to admit defeat and supported by his Kuwaitis sitting behind their great walls^has continuously protested to Bin Saud against these acts of war. Bin gaud as often has apologized for his officials® and tribes' misdeeds but has never punished or restrained any of his people. Shaikh Ahmad as in the days of the Saxons and Danes has tried at times to buy off Bin Saudis police parties by supplying them with free rations in the hopes that they would go. Ihey have only come in greater numbers. 16 o She notorious Amir of Hassa, Bin jaloui, has been in charge of operations from the beginning and later sent his son j^had to conduct matters on the spot. Shis youth has been responsible for some outrageous acts and until nemesis over took him recently^ was growing more and more impudent in his methods, it is said that he was on his way to occupy jahara for good and conduct the blockade from inside Kuwait territory when he was killed in Hassa recently» one crime of Bin jaloui 4 s which did more than anything else to stiffen the resistence of the Shaikh of Kuwait's people was the cold blooded mmtex murder of 2 Nejdis who were handed over by Shaikh Ahmad on a promise of safe conduct to Bin jaloui and a fair trial* g?he crime I understand was that they had brought 3 camels across the border into Kuwait. As soon as the Nejdis were handed over, they had their throats cut from ear to ear by a negro slave a few yards outside the main gate of the city. Hhe negro shouting out (it is said)/'thus shall-9- tel uay master teaoh you, 0 people of Kuwait, that his boundary extends up to your veiy walls' 1 ^ Ihis inoident happened 4 years ago* Si 17. Throughout the ahove blooJsade or , Bin gaud has been astute enough to keep up a seemingly friendly oor- respondenoe with Shaikh Ahmad, in &amp;K particular has he always denied responsibility for any Akhwan raids and damage, though these very raiders who are today in revolt against Bin Saud, one and all will admit that they received direct orders to act as they did on every occasion from Bin gaud himself., not even through his Governor, Bin jalouio (I myself asked the Akhwan leaders Jiaisal al—Shiblan, Hzam al—Hathiain and al—puqm this very question recently and all admitted it was so). 18. in conclus ion from a long talk which I had yester day with Shaikh Ahmad, I gather the proposals which he is now formulating will take the following line, I think his demands are moderate;- (a) 3?here must be ccmplete freedom of trade between the people of Nejd and Kuwait, this to apply to townsmen as well as tribesmen. In other words the siea ^e or blockade to cease. (b) No parties of Bin Saud or Bin jaloui, tribal or regular forces, to be allowed to cross the frontier at any time. (c } Bin Saud to have as many customs posts on the frontier as he chooses. (d) She manifest system to oome into force c (e) Reciprocal arrangements for surrender ing criminals to be set up. (f) small matters of disagreement to be settled between both Rulers direct. If these cannot be adjusted, both sides to agree to refer them to His Majesty^s Government for decision. (g) If possible Kuwait southern boundary to be rectified, so as to bring at■10- least one of the big three tribes who a^Lat onoe belonged to Kuwait under Kuwait control onoe more. This as an aot of delayed Justice and to give Kuwait a defence force. Such tribe if possible to be the AJman, the Awazim being too unwarlike. Kuwait that with the removal of the biockade ; trade will revive and Kuwait return to her former prosperity. Ihe answer is that provided Bin Baud does not impose a prohibitive duty, her lost trade will return for tbe following reasons;- (a) Kuwait has no sea journey by dhow, as is the case at Ojair, ^atif and jubail, (b) Caravan leaders find superb grazing at jahara for their tired camels after their long journey up to the coast and can afford to give them a month's rest before the return journey. At ojair^ ^tif and jubail the grazing is practically nil. (o) It is no common thing f or a Mejd caravan to lose 40^ of its camels at these latter ports, whilst in the north there is no loss at all, and where actual camels are owned by the merchants of Nejd as they almost always are, this is a serious matter. (d) At Hoffuf in the south Bin jaloui has made it a rule to seize merchants 9 camels just in from Nejd or Hassa, and force them to make one trip at least in conveying Bin gaud' l s government 'stores' from the coast up to Riath, (sukhra system). (e) Last but more important than all the above points put together is the fact that very goo^ ''credit' is given by the merchants of Kuwait,® and this point alone tends and always will tend to attract merchants of ^asim, Hail and lower Nejd to the detriment of other ports on the Bast Cost and the towns of Mecca and 19. It may be asked what guarantee has the shaikh ofMedina in the West. Hhis credit system 1ms to be seen to be believedo It is no/oommon feature for a merobant to come to Kuwait with £ 100 in his pocket, and to purchase £ 600 worth of rice and piece goods. He pays when he likes, and no interest is charged, foday Mejd owes the merchants of Kuwait many thousands of pounds dating from the period before the blockade 0 Repayment is very slowly being made and only last week I no- ticed that a man of Skaqur 08 ^000/- via jubail to Kuwait in settlement of a debt 7 years old. 2 0# we now come to the question as to what customs Bin gaud oan charge on goods entering Nejd via Kuwait, without upsetting the trade via Bahrain too much. Today the dues charged are as follows;— (a) Ooods via Kuwait have to pay 4^ KUwait sea Customs plus 2% land export duty, both of which go to Shaikh of Kuwait. Total 6^. Goods via ojai r have to pay 83^ to Bahrain and 7^ to Bin Saud at OjaiTc Sotal 9^. If therefore Bin Saud were to impose a 7^ duty on Kuwait goods entering Nejd, I am of opinion this would be a reasonable tax« even though the total dity on goods entering Nejd y via Kuwait would rise to 12%, as opposed to 9^ via Bahrain and Ojair. It is possible however, that even at this figure the trade via Bahrain would suffer aUd be diverted to Kuwait, so great is the popularity of KUwait compared with other ports o If this turned out to be so, the balance could probably be struck fairly evenly if the duty were raised to 10% on goods via Kuwait. I know i^asim merchants are prepared to go to this figure but not more. That is to say a total of 1Q%- / 1 321. ot course, we shall have to deal with the opposition of the great house of al-&lt;^osaibi of Bahrain and Hassa, and private Bankers to Bin Saud. Shis firm farms the customs of OJair, (^atif and jubail eveiy year, and makes a very good thing out of it. uheir policy has been to kill Kuwait and without doubt it has largely been at their instance that Kuwait has been blocioaded for so long, under the proposal mentioned in para graph 2o above, I think at least one third of the trade which goes via Bahrain now would be diverted to Kuwait. How are the ^osaibi family going to meet this loss. I can myself see no way out of it, than for Bin Saud to close down the farm and take direct customs revenue himself, or, ask the &lt;^osaibi family to take up the Kuwait farm as well, a suggestion so full of dif ficulties as to be inpracticablec As things are, the chief opposition without doubt to a settlement of the Kuwait-Bin Saud question is going to come from this powerful businessman house of al-^osaibi, and it were well that His Majesty's Government be warned what to expect from the start. Bin Saud, I fancy, is very greatly in debt, financially and morally to the (^osaibi family, and the pressure they will be able to bring will be of no mean order.

Ai'ter greetings and compliments etc., With, the hand of affection, I duly received your letter mo .449 dated 22nd Safar (29th July 1929), including translation of a telegram (T./9 dated 27th July 1929) received by you from the Hon fi ble the Political Resident in the persian Oulf. I have n^ted the contents, and have understood what His Excellency desired to comvey 0 I also am grateful for the care and attention which His Excellency has shown to me his friend. I therefore thank the High British aovemment for its favour and kindness, and desire you to convey my gratitude and thanks to the Hobble the political Resident in the Persian Gfulf • As for myself I am the loyal friend of His Majesty 1 ^ Government. As regards my brother Bin gaud, you know^ary well that there is no rial enmity (Khasama) between him and myself in anything, and I trust there never will be. The good relations existing between us are of a permanent nature, and where he is concerned 1 shall by Qod^ will, endeavour with all the influ ence and power at my disposal to loyally cany out the wishes of His Majesty*s Qovemment, not only in T8ca®ixb3c word but by deed. nevertheless 1 would request you to inform the Hon # ble the political Resident of all the happenings that have befallen Kuwait f at the hands of Bin Saud) , of the Blockade of my territories, of the continual raids (gharat) of Bin Baud's Akhwan, and the attacks by his regular forces (garia) and all within the boundaries of Kuwait, and one and all being actsof cruel perseoution on my subjects of Kuwait contrary to all laws and my rights. I would further ask you to make report on the seizure of the goods exported for poor Bedouin^ tribes, whether^were taken out by their aubjects or by the subjects of my or other states „ All this and more is due to the strictness of (Bin Saud 1 s) blo ckade of Kuwait, and to the activities of his forces near my city* 'jo such anpl extent has trade between Nejd and Kuwait been interfered with that my revenue has been reduced from its former figure by 70^» Shis too has been brought about by Bin gaud's siege operations which have been going on without interruption from the year 1340 {\^ C j \ ) to the present time. UJhere can be no doubt that such methods (of Bin saud) bring grief to pure affection, and displease the best friendship. She present request of His Majesty's Government that I should put forward the proposals which I deem suitable (for solving the Kuwait-Nejd dispute) has given me veiy great satis- faction, and will further bring joy and happiness to many. Hor can there be any doubt that this is due to the kindness and generosity felt by His Majesty's Oovemment for their friend. It is of course m * think able that I should go against the orders of His Majesty's aovemment in anything tlaat is desired or approved of. So revert again to the attacks of the Akhwan and regular forces (of Bin Saud), I have bom these with patience, and have complained to Bin Saud on every single occasion that they happened. But I regret to say that no restitution of my own stolen property, or that of any of my subjects has been made as yet. Moreover I have been doing jpxr utmost to meet Bin Saud in eveiy single request that he has put forward or that would give him satisfaction. Nor can nor will he deny what I say. Unfortunately I have received nothing in return to give me or my people pleasure^ As regards Kuwait generally, we have not sufficient force or streggbh to defend ourselves from these continuous attacks, seeigg that our tribes and defenders were taken away from us, when sir peroy cox reduced the territories and bounda-,-.0 boundaries or Kuwait, how oould they remain with us seeing that they no longer had sufTioient room to graze their oamels and flooks, whilst the constant fear of Bin Saudis attacks hastened their going over to the other side. Had the territories of Kuwait today been as before and our tribes been with us we should not have importuned His MaJesty^s Government, but would have defended our own borders, and carried out any orders, that His Majesty 1 ^ Government had cared to impose without in anyway asking for or expecting help. As things are, we can do nothing for w© have no power to defend ourselves, whatever therefore that the oovernment &gt; A sees fit to decide, must be accepted. iff I am no^B putting forward to Your Honour three state ments, t he first includes the number of raids and attacks made by bi* 1 Saud 8 s Akhwan within the boundaries of Kuwait and the number of Kuwait subjects killed, and the amount of pro perty stolen. I^he gecond gives the number of raids made by Bin Saud'e Regular droops (A saria), also within Kuwait boundaries with property seized etc. She t hird gives in detail my proposals and demands vis—a—vis b !^- Saud and which you have requested me to furnish c Whatever action His Majesty^s Government decides to take or whatever line it approves of, that will be the right and propitious one- (Sealed) .

He 'brought up the question of the letter, arid said }tie had been thinking things over and had decided in hiw own mind that 'Duvrishls ^ letter was a forgery, as many of the expressions used and %h great length of the letter was entirely unlike Duwishl He said that he was helped in this view by the fact that he remembered it being said that after Sabilla Duwish's ring (signet) had 'been stolen from him. 1 thought nothing more of the matter till yester day when at my interview -with the two Akhwan leaders Hizam and Al Fu%m,the former happened to drop a similar remark, and said at Sabilla not only was Faisal shot but his seal was taken from him. There may be something in what Shaikh Ahmad said after all and i tell you the story as a matter of interest. [The last ten days have been particularly trying.

The Shaikh has now confided to Dickson that although he will go on with the armed car scheme he has no great faith in it # as he can not trust hie M'own Kuwaitis to face the Bedouins. It is all very trying as he could easily have told me this in Kuwait^or have informed Dickson before he sent his telegram indenting for machine guns for the Shaikh.. As you are no doubt aware the Shaikh lias a legitimate grouse against Bin Saud inii 'Mr V iti fTiir for depriving him of his Bedouin defenders and Iftrati for bullying him thereafter. He is very anxious to obtain the return of at least one tribe, the Ajman for preference, and I think this new objection to armed cars is merely a moVe in his game, which is to persuade ^ His Majesty^ Government to insist that Bin Baud should return the Awazim at least to his allegiance. I see very little hope of success for the Shaikh, but this must be what he is after* I suppose the rthaikh is objecting to the despatch of gun crews to Baghdad for fear that it should His Excellency Sir Gilbert Clayton, K.C.M.G., K.B«£., C.B., High. Commissioner for Iraq, Baghdad•»0. should be said he has sold himself to the British. It is difficult to follow the working of the Arah mind, but this fear of British penetration seems to be at the bottom of all the actions of our Coastal Shaikhs. Dickson promises me that he will get the Shaikh to ask for British instructors, and i think we had better be content with this, though it is not all I the Royal Air tfaree required. ^•here is another point connected with liuwait which 1 think it would be as well to mention. 5?he Royal Air Force until very recently kept a Special Service Officer there. I'his officer whose nar-te is Button obtained information and sent messages to the Royal Air Force quite independently of the Political Agent f in a small place like Kuwait there is really no room for two independent British authorities. Dickson declares that Bur to n• b news was often quite unnecessarily alarmist and gave a fals® impression at Baghdad. I have met Burton twice and there is no doubt that he is a good fellow, but he knows no Arabic and so must be in the hands of Christian and other . Interpreters. Even if he were a perfect special .Service Officer his position must arouse a certain amount of Jealousy in the -oliUcai Apent, who is the accredited representative of his majesty's Govern ment and supposed to be something of an expert. Two independent British representatives in a small place give the Oriental a heaven-sent chance for the employnent of a XittXe 'diplomacy-. and he needs BUBt try to play off one against the other. A case of this aort occurred in Here's time- Tide your letterWo. 6188, dated the 6th June 1929 t ^he Action of the Royal Air Force Headquarters in this case was absolutely correct, but that of the Hpecial Service Officer at Hasiriych was not, and the affair supports ay contention that the oriental is bound to intrigue. Would it not be possible to arrange that / if the 'Royal Air i &lt;'orce must send a Special service office to Kuwait^should ^ork strictly in conjunction with the Political Agent and send no news raessages of any sort without showing them to him. I am mentioning this matter to you as, if you agree with tee, I shall be g^d of your support to get the question settled privately without official correspondence. $ cl. ct'U/ Britieh ReBideney and Consulate-General, Bu8hire t 8th Jlu^sust 1929.

There is no such difference between Judicial standards in Kuwait and Hajd as to render proposal No. 6 undesirable. Proposal JNo. 8 which runs directly con trary to Bin Sand's policy is sure however to meet at first with a direct refusal and it will be difficult to get Bin Saud to consider it. Bin Saud would like to claim all the Bedouin tribes including those in allegiance to the, Iraq Gov ernment as his subjects. He does not like fixed boundaries either between himself and Iraq or himself and Kuwait. This has always been his claim and it waa made unmistakably clear viien Bin baud's men commanded^ by Abdulla bin Adwah^under the supreme command of Bin Jilawi^obtained the surrender of two Majd merchants #io had been guilty of bringing three camels across the border into Kuwait and had taken refuge in Kuwait town. A negro slave of Bin Jilawi promptly cut the throats of these unfortunates at the gate of Kuwait exclaiming in a loud tone : ••Thus shall my master 'teach you, oh people of Kuwait, that his boundary ii 'extends up to your very walls9 l*his incident appears as Ho. 6 in Statement 2. 4^ The Shaikh of Kuwait himself would also be happy to do without boundaries in the desert, and in 1921 t before the Uqair Conference, admitted to major More that no frontier was necessary between his territory and Wajd (Bolitical Agent, Kumit»s Ho. 181-C. —■iiimih 1 ^ . — 'liarConfidential.

A 11 the above information has been sent to Buttolph and also to Aviation, Hin^i^ 1 - afce latest news about the raid by MUtriga (Mutair) on th { ghammari gracing party near Raudhatain on 29th July, is that tha police at Safwan gave chase, found tha Shammari shepherds, followed up the raiders, and caught them up somewhere near Ar-Riliai.(the easternmost point of the At-Tawal). The raxders apparently abandoned the loot, six of their own camels, anddropped two rifles in their hurry to get away, which they did suocessfiillyl I think it is a great pity., if the above version of the story is oorreot, that the police did not give ohase, as these raiders have never been properly dealt with, and this seems to have been a golden opportunity, as I believe the police had about four Lewis guns with them, mounted on oarsl Ihe raiders were evidently some of Ibn sa'ud^ loyal tribesi ajhe rebels•» raiding party, said to be under the leader ship of Azaiyiz ad-Dawish, are reported to have reached jariyat al 1 Hya, and to be making for f^iyao Another report states that Ibn M^ sa4ad has returned to Hail, and that his force is moving to Hafar al Batin, from Ajibba.

Subject;'* Duwish's letter to Amir Saud. i f Sir, I have the honour to refer you to my telegram No.428 dated the 15th july 1929 and previous conespondence. A rather curious incident has resulted which, I think is worth reporting. ghaiMi Akmad saw me two days ago and reminditfj me of Faisal ad-mwish's letter to Amir Saud, told me that at the time he felt grave doubts as to the genuineness of the missive. In particular he suspected the (a) inordinate length (b) the expression that he the Ruler of Kuwait was a chicken. He had therefore mentioned the whole matter to Hillal al Mutairi who, as you know, never loses touch with his old trxbe the Mutair. He had also shown him the copy of ffaisal's letter which I had presented to him, Shaikh Ahmad. Hillal who at the time supported shaikh Ahmad in his views, it seems wrote to ad- Duwish and taxed him with the matter. The latter has replied swearing as big an oath as he can (by his religion and by his wives honour and his own) that he never used the expression 'chicken' at all, and that his only letter to Amir Saud was in reply to one received, and was a short statement only of why he left Artawiyeh, nothing more, paisal ad-Duwish added that the letter complained of was an obvious forgery,and especially as his opponents were in pcssession of his seal (taken, as reported, at Sabilla). paisal asked Hillal al mtairi to inform both Shaikh Ahmad and the colonel Dickson of this answer of his.

I'm all for having as iittle to do with Baghdad as possible also, hut I have felt myself in a 'bit of a quandary since I've been here, by the presence of Burton, Baghdad's S.^.G. or 'eye' here- Fe^onally i find Burton, a British Kegimental Officer, a nice fellow and a 'sahib', but he is none the less an 11 eye', and not only have I felt that his presence here is because 1 cannot be trusted to submit to Baghdad accurate information, but conversely I feel very often that he sends information not quite of a 'cricket' type, and i have been at pains to repeat to High Commissioner things, largely to counteract things reported by the S.H.O. Personally 1 should, prefer that the were withdrawn, especially as 1 was never asked by Aviation whether l should like hir in the place, and if his removal back to Basrah (his headquarters; could be arranged without giving offence anywhere , 1 should be glad. I've of course nothing against him personally but he gives me moments of anxiety, as he is surrounded by five agents, chief of whom is a christian of Mosul, while Burton does not speak Arabic at all. Button keeps me supplied with copies of his 'en clair' messages but occasionally he lets off a cypher message, the general •hiaflab' of which he comes and tells me later. l?or instance^he reported 2 days ago that 3 lorries laden with rice and dates were seen to leave Shaikh Ahmad's palace after dark , proceed out of the city by his private gate (non existent), disappear into the'blue' and presumably as he said, to the rebels. That :A m hat is the sort of information which i think should not 'be sent, as it is likely to put people against Shaikh Ahmad. Shaikh Ahmad would never do such a thing. nor does he keep stores in his palace, not has he a x^i^y-te gate, not can motor cars reach Subaihiyah to-day owing to Saud, let alone Wafrah, unless a 150-mile detour is made. Last 'but not least, the stores were, as far as x can make out, for Shaikh Abdullah bin Sal in, wh6 is building on to his country house by the sea 2^- miles away; and consisted as far as 1 can make out, of c eme n t bans , and other building material. But please do not mention this, as i should hate to have it repeated to Button nor can i definitely prove my story, though 1 almost can. All is well here, though for the last 3 days the 'tiareh' has gone and it is stoking up seriously. We have haa one day 112 and 2 days 106° —— with more to come. m hank you for having sent on and recommended the Lebanon for me to recess at. T^ven it i cannot get there this year. It would be useful to establish a precedent by getting a sanction to its being used by Kuwait. Three days ago Shaikh /^hmad sent a trusty man to visit all the rebel shaikhs including Duwish and to again inform them that whether victorious or beaten they must not dare to cross the frontier, else they would be bombed. The messenger incidentally will bring back latest information. Shaikh Ahmad has also written to Bin Baud protesting very strongly against Bin Jiloui's accusation that Bin Subah's standard was cax^tured at A1 Ritha, and that his fidawis were raiding with the Ajrnan. 1 advised him to do this^ and also to explain man^ other incidents such as Azaiyiz not being allowed to enter the city, my interview with Faisal bin Shiblan and ny straight talk with him. it is just as well for Bin oaud to get the Shaikh* s side of the (question especially as some scores of rascals in Kuwait ate, as far as 1 can see, for ever wiring him (from Zubair) untold lies about Kuwait. I absolve Hafasi who is in a difficult position- 3 - position and does his 'best, so does shaikh Ahmad. Shaikh Alnnad is positive that J3in Baud will attempt / nothing till the heat is over, i.e. 2-% months hence^and will content himself 'by sending out letters to try and breed dis union among the rebels. The rebels on the other hand, Shaikh Ahmad assures me, are not in the least nervous of the f future and firmly believe that Bin Haud will be unable to touch them: also Hasa is not only the onlji rebel centre, but it stretches right across notth Uajd. lie says that the rebels certainly believe (whether true or notj that the Ataibah and Harb are all out and have spoilt this whole of the north (kharbatu min medina ilul Hasa). Duwish, he says, in pargicular^. has lots of arms and ammunition, , and latest rumours are that the Ajman managed to p inch a convoy o f British rifles go ing from Ojair to Has a (Balirain sh; uldbe able to confirm this if true). A good deal of estra business if being done in Kuwait 'safar' (bazaar; and Kuwaitfs trade is bucking up. i am rather anxious about thisy but it is hard to blame the Kuwaiti, if he sees a chance to sell his stocks. A cood deal of stuff goes out to Braiah Mutair (Bin Baud's loyal people at Hafar, also to Shammar and Dhafir at Ugubba also Bin Saud's people;, but onl^an expert can differentiate between the loyal and dis loyal Mutair people^ Shaikh Ahmad continues to assure me that nothing gets out officially to Ajman or diMier rebels such as ibn Mashur, but he admits that supplies can reach them in l a dozen different/ underground ways. As for arms and ammunition^ 1 be14eve nothing goes nut, simply because the rebels have plenty. Food is all thev need. It is interesting to learn that Al Duwish, before he left Artawlyeh, received a nice present of many rifles and boxes of ammunition from Bin Saud, i suppose to lieep quiet !! Ibn Shuqair is another difficulty where supplies are con cerned . Apparently he has not yet 'cut' with Bin Baud. Tie sends in his Mutair men regularly to jget food from Kuwait onon the strength of this fact. Dawish is trying he knows to get him to join hi^ but he refuses to move. The whole so-called blockade is a pretty problem and i for one shall be glad when Bin Baud appears in Uajd. 1 confess my sympathies are with Kuwait and cannot see why we should pick Bin Saud T s chestnuts out of the fire. The wretched Kuwaiti is only too keen to get his own back. Why not be entirely 'neutral' -- that should be our game. If Bin Saxid really wants us to assist and it is His Majesty's Government's policy to prevent 'food' getting to so-called rebels and their unfortunate mmen and children, why then he must give us a complete list of names of shaikhs of tribes, ditto of sub-tribes, and ditto of sections of those tribes, who are not to be sold food. God knows^ for Instance^ if the Braih (Mutair) have been told to pose as Bin Baud's loyal subjects by the' Akhwan, with the object of supplying the rest of the Akhwan with food. The Bedouin is capable of any devilment t! Forgive this long screed. i have just rambled oil putting my thoughts on ^aper, without idea or method. if they help to give you a picture of the things here i shall feel relieved. The Shaikh is very pleased with your efforts at Baghdad f to keep Ira^ police out. 'Re Lev/is guns J he wants you to get him 3 more for the present^ as^ till the 'ghaus' is over^he'is faced with difficulty of crews#- i am wiring you his views^ so will not go on here. All good wishes and ever so many thanks for the grand support you are givin^ne. My relations with Bhaikh Ahmad continue most cordial. Yours sincerely, SI)/ H.T5.F.

I meant to have explained at the time why 1 had acted as I did, but one thing and another has come in the way to i) re vent me doing so. I would like to let you know however what they were even though I am late. Firstly, I discovered from my files that every iter of intelligence used to 'be telegraphed to High Commissioner; ■Resident; ope cial, Basrah; Gikubb; Admin tor, Basrah; and some- times to Special, Hasriyeh — in fact almost tb the whole world by my predecessor. Secondly, I gathered from More that he had once tried to cut down things and not wire to Baghdad, and had got into hot water. I therefore thought it tactful to continue the raovemont, though I for thevsiost part wirei you and repeated High Commissioner only;. However since getting your specific orders, 1 feel much happier and have repeated nothing in the intelligence % line, or letter, to any one. 1 am a little bit anxious however now that Burton has gone as to courect procedure. Bhall I carry on as T am floing and send nothing to Baghdad unless obviously urgent , or shall I rer)eat any intelligence that- I think worth wiring to you to Highcoma also ? I shall be gar ^teful for a line of advice. Yours sincerely. (Signed) R.K P. Dickeon61/14 n*' (^06) Telegram E. ^rom ' PolitiGal Bahrein. To Political Resident, Bushlre.

(a) Shaikh Mubarak late ruler of Kuwait married, (1) the daughter of Ibn Hathlain the para mount chief of the Ajman. (2) Another A^man lady the daughter of a lesser chieftain of the A J mane The first lady (1) bore him Shaikh Nasir who was created a pasha by the Turks. The second lady (2) bore him Shaikh Hamad a frequent visitor to the Agency to day. 2. Shaikh Nasir Pasha also married a lady from the House of Hathlain and she bore him shaikh Subah who recently served a term of imprisonment for killing his brotherc (Subah/'s wild desert blood, I think, accounts for the rather foolish ac^ done in hot blood) = 3, Shaikh jabir a still later Ruler of Kuwait., married the daughter of the ,f Mutlagiai M a noble family of the Ajman, This lady bore him among others Shaikh Ahmad the present ruler. During the lifetime of Shaikh jabir the lady was divorced., and Shaikh Nahar al Mutlagim of the Ajman married hereThis faot does not prevent the mot iter visiting her son on frequent occasions and spend^days at a time in Kuwaitc 4o Shaikh Ahmad the Ruler, who therefore has Ajman hlood in his veins, has also married an Ajmi Chief t s daughter whom he iceeps out at jaharao (He has 2 children by her) o This in addition to his. shammari wife. 5 o At the present moment a visitor in the shape of the daughter of Dhaidan al Hathlain the late paramount Shaikh of the AJman is on a visit to the town-wife of Shaikh Ahmad and is staying in 'Dasman' 1 palace. It is difficult to see what ksT ' action one can take to prevent such visits among womeno 6. several other minor members of the al Subah house similarly are connected with the Mutair and Ajman tribesf, and if one realizes the number of these marriage^ connections it does not become difficult to understand why the Subah families sympathy is entirely on the s ide of the Rebels in their struggle with Bin Saudo After all blood is thicker than waters and in the light of the above facts^ Shaikh Ahmad•s efforts to carry out our policy of denying supplies to the Ajman becomes even more praiseworthy than at first sights 7 0 Shaikh Mubarak of course made marriage connections with the Ajman, Mutair, shammar and other tribes of Arabia from reasons of policy, and results were very successful.His successors Shaikhs Salim, Jabir and Ahmad have carried on the game in lesser degree, and may be counted to continue to do so q o ot course the ^wafcim, Rashaida and Araibdar Arabs bein of inferior class are neither taken in marriage nor are given daughters by the *Sherif* tribes like Ajmn, Mutair :*bc. 9 o It is interesting to record also that the land on whi da Kuwait town is built is claimed by the Dooshan family oi the mtair. The early *Subah' and'Khalifa' settlers from Me J d had to obtain the mtair% permission before being allowed to build or camp on the present sitec I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, political Agent, Kuwait*,COJ^IDENTIAIj, L mj No. 463 c [j i .1 § M l..

The Hon^ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushiret, Faisal al-Duwish^s raid on the Sbei and Sahool at ^yao Sir, in continuation of my telegram HOo4i66 dated 12th August 1929, I have the honour to forward the following fuller details of this insurgent success which in my opinion is likely to have a far reaching effect on those tribes and groups of Bedouin who are still sitting on the fence. EUBoShaikh Ahmad received intimation of the engagement this morning (12th August 1929) in the shape of a short note from j&amp;isal al Duwish giving the hare facts as stated in my telegram. A Salutoba from Nejd however also arrived at the same time who stated that he had fallen to with the raid ing party a day before the attaok, and had been forced to ge with it being only released after the affair was over. The Salubba's tale, whioh Shaikh Ahmad considers reliable ( he knows the man who has a family at Kuwait) is as follows, and is given in the form of paragraphs below;- fa) Al Duwish left al t^raa and al Haba south of gafa, where he had been in hiding more or less, on the 8nd August. His force numbered about 3000 camelmen (this I consider an oxageration) with 250 horses „ / o a?here being no water 'between (^araa and (^ya which is pronounced OAIYSH by the Arabs, he decided to do the 130 miles by a two-day 'Dash' .■ v i a V (o) At (c^jaya were located 400 tents of the Sbei and Sahool tribes supported toy a detaohment (SIRRIA) of 13o of Bin Saudis regular troops. (d) She attack oame as a oomplete surprise, and not much of a fight was put up toy any one. (e) Thousands of sheep were taken and muoh loot though no oamels were oaptured as these had all gone a day'*s journey away to graze. (f) two important Stoei and Sahool shaikhs were killed though not more than 40 of the rank and file: tout the men of Bi*i Saudis, detachment were nearly all killed. (g) Before the actual attack was launched, Faisal al-Duwish had called all his leaders together, and had enjoined on them the necessity of ceasing from their old methods of killing wholesale &lt;= He toade them to accept the surrender of any man who threw down his rifle in token of sutomission, and ordered them to harm no woman or child® (h) After the toattle al-Duwish fed all his cap tives, and ordered any who wished to depart, he also detailed parties to drive toack to (^araa his last camp a large proportion of the sheep taken, though the teller of the story gave it as his opinion that pro- toatoly only half would ever arrive, owing to lack of water and the intense heat. (i) Al-Duwish next sent out patrols in the direc tion of AJitotoa and Hafar al Atz, at tooth of which places Bi^uSaud has forces. (j) Three tooxes of ammunition intact were taken from the detachment as well as many rifles and a saddle toag full of money. (kj Hafar al Atz is situated to the South East of aaya. 1 have the honour to toe.

The Arabic original is not very easy to translate,but from the last paragraph it would appear that the King desi res that I should start a regular correspondence with him regarding rebel movements etc. with a view to an exchange ot ideas. As the King**s letter has come under official cover, I should be glad to Jcnow how I should act in the matter. To my mind the King either wishes me to write him an occasional private letter giving him news, of rebels etc., much as Shaikh Ahmad does, or he finds himself so out of touch with affairs in general in his eastern province^, that he hopes to use me as a sort of 'Maison officer' between himself and His Majesty*s Government much as I used to be when at Bahrain in 1919-^20 and the present letter is his first moveo I have the honour to be, Sir, your most obedient servant.

(a) The party reached Riath 7 days before Bin gaud arrived there* They were seized by the ^Braih'' at eafar al Batin on their way south, but were released at the intervention of one of B in Saudis officers, (b) on his arrival, Bin Saud was kind to them, but continually talked ^big 1 * of what he was going to do at the end of ^Rabia al Awal ,f (25th of August^ with the insurgents in Hassa. (o)» The party found a vast gathering of Southern Bedouin at Riath and these Bin Saud was feeding freely with food and gifts. He also was disbursing arms and ammunition in quantities T hey were struck with the fact that there were very few important ShalKhB in Riath, Among those they saw or heard of were Ibn Shuqairy ^ (al-Molaamad) , Misiiari al-Musaiyis (Braih) , Half ibn Maziad, paisal al-Duwish :, s protege at Artawiyeh.. 3?hese tliree latter Bin saud was keeping more or less under restraint,, tiieir following iaaving been ordered to return home 0 (d) Bin Saud told my informant that gaud his son (Abu Sbarrain) Jaad gone to Hassa for a 10 days' touro (sinoe oonfinned by telegram from saud to the Shaikh of Kuwait dated loth August 1929} . yy inform ant could not say if saud was going to replace Abdul Aziz al-JMrki as Commander of 3?roops in Hassa, or was merely going to visit Bin Jaloui and report on his condition. (e) All the members of the saud family were with the King except Faisal his son. (t) No Ataiba Shaikhs were seen with Bin Saud-c My informant could not understand the absence of these, (s) W informant^ opinion was that Bin saud was making clear preparations for a Bedouin campaign against the rebels, but all depended on whether Ataiba chiefs would play ^straight 11 c (h) Bin Saudis information regarding rebels appeared poor; for instance he had no idea when they, the messengers, left on 1st August that Faisal al- Duwish had left Bassa for an ijnknown destination, and only on 2nd August when they were a day out of Riath did express mesBengers pass them going North to warn everyone that al~nuwish was on the war path. (i) on their return Journey to Kuwait the party crossed the tracks of Duwish's raiderso These were heavy an dwell marked and led south o Numbers were estimated at two or three thousandc (J) Acting on the previous instructions of Shaikh of Kuwait, the chief messenger asked Bin Saud in Riati if he would accept the surrender of the insurgents if he ' ShaikhAbmad, oould arrange such. Bin Saud hadgiven Mm a definitly negative reply. / ^ v Similarly under orders ttie oliief messenger had upbraided Bin Saud for his oontinuous harsh an d unfriendly treatment of Kuwait and demanded in the name of 'Allah' to know what shaiMi Ahmad had ever done to him, except return good for evil. Bin saud had pretended to weep, and had sworn that Shaikh Ahmad was his dearest friend, and he looked upon Kuwait as his birthplace, and though only one woman remained alive in Kuwait city he would honour her above all women, so highly did he regard Shaikh Ahmad, the town, its people-etc.etc. (1) Bin saud's last instructions to the chief messenger were 'bo 'tell ghailda Ahmad to send all further letters by sea via oj&amp;iro I have the honour to be.

Restltutloi Is made In most cases and the matter ends. (b) Should the strayed oamel or camels not be restored the owners have the right to watoh far a ohanoe and can seize property, livestock or even maa belonging to that tribe as op portunity occurs and they consider suitable, and can retain such in their possession until their own plundered property is surrender ed. (o) in spite &lt;f this shoold the Binning tribe still be obstinate (aaseen). and not return the camels, then they the sinned a^inst have the right to hold what they have got in exchange afi must be satisfied w tbh s ame,■ it being assumed that they have seized and hold an equal number of camels to those lost neither more nor less.

Should the guilty tribe refuse to obey the order of its paramount Government, and it becomes impossible to recover the property stolen, then the Government of the injured tribe, has the right to recover its subjects 1 property 121 Itjaom. time and by whatever means it sees fit to employ. &gt; V• mhe case of 'stolen^ or 'lost' camels, recognized in a .

If the recognizing party, and the person withwhom the camel is found, are members ct tribes which are friendly and on goo d terms with each other, and if their respective tribes are on good terms with the ruler ac Governor of the town in ques tion - then it is upto the accuser to produce three witnesses who will swear that the property he claims is his own.

VII. Rules gggs oi rega rding ^aakat' . A Ruler, a Governor o^ Shaikii of a jsriMH principality, has the right to levy 'zakat' from his subject tribe every year* This is calculated to be (a) one Riyal for full grown camel, (b) half Riyal for a yoimg and half grown, (c) one sheep of the best, or its value, for every forty steep -whether large or small. The head of the tribe paying the ^ikat' 8 is entitled to a present or reward from the Ruler etc.,for services rendered in f recovering the tax from hispeople. y VIII.

(d) should a war break out he has the right to call upon all his^ribal subjects to fight for him. Failing their doing so he can and has the right to confiscate all their property.w g 11 1 The custom of * 'Arafa ' , Or recognition of animals by a former own e r, whegi found in possession o^ an otiier person or tribe. I. The case of camels captured in a Raid. Should two tribes 'asta'araf* to one another (have the special agreement), party may take from the other, camels once belonging to the former and now brought from the enemy by the latter; £ - Thus if a number of camels had been captured from 'the •Adman by tbe •Awazim, and on some la iter occasion were recovered by the Mutairc The 'AJman would have the right to take back their camels from the MUtair, without compensation, provided the custo m of n Arafa ,r existed between 'AJman and Mutair. II* The case of camels bo ught from one personadLiy by another ani later recognized by a former owner as having been stolea from him. The case is settled in this wise. if the two men are of the same tribe (i.e., tte purchaser and the former owner), or belong to two tribes with the special agreemedat by which their relations are those of ' sani 'Am ', then the purchaser and the original owner, together with theanimal in dispute, have to go to the seller. Firom him they re cover tie purchase money and give it to the man who has purchased the camel, and the original owner takes his prop erty. For example a man of SiSnmar recognizes a camel with a man of the Dhafir, and the latter states he purchased it from the Mutair. Should the Dhafir and Siimmar have a 'sani A •Am' arrangement between them, they will both go and see the Mutairi. if the Mutairi had himself raided or-stolen the camel from the Shammari, and the Mutairi and the Shammar were at peace, he will return the purchase price to the Dhafiri, and the Shammari may then take the camel he claims e If tbe Mutairi has himself bought tte camel i % fromfrom another say an •AJmi, he will still pay toaok the price to the Dhafiri and will then go and olaim his money from the 4 Ajad., and so on till they get haok to the original thief. in other words all intervening sales and purchases are undone The above is the general idea of the system, Tout it is open to many variations according to circumstances, also to special agreements between tribes etc., etc. So called Desert Law is rarely a hard, and fast thingo Many arbitrators vaiy it slightly or try to arrange a compromise in difficult or protracted cases. in most cases precedent has a great deal to do with settling difficult problems and so we have the ^Ahl al Khibra' or wise old men versed in how old and difficult cases were settled formerlyc These wiseacres have much to do with the interpr ebatioi cf Desert Law. However the principles of Desert Law are in brief as follows;- (a) a camel taken in war or retaken in war, by a friend of the first owner is surrendered without compensa tion. if the custom of 'Arafa' exists. There is no selling, (bj No camel bought for money can possibly be taken back by the original owner, without compensation, under any circumstances, evei if the original or final owner b e of the same tribe. T^ere is one exertion namely if the original owner can prove that the buyer, when he purchased the animal, was aware that it had been stolen from a man of a friendly tribe* Thus if the # Awazim bought sheep from ibn Shukair the day after his raid on the Bani Malik, the latter can recover their sheep from the 'Awazim without compensationc otherwise nobody can retake a purchased animal and leave the purchaser a loser. All sales must be undone, back to the original theftc ifi practice this more often than not is impossible, and a compromise is arranged.SS5) u politioal Age^oyi Kuwai 'bo Da lied 'the IGiib.

It may interest you to know that sinoe very ancient times (iyam al jahal), the Ajman alone almost from among the great Bedouin tribes have been accustomed to give certain 'cognomens' or 'nick names', usually of an unpleasent kind to their children which stick to the recipents throughout their lives. I give below four examples of prominent men today having such nick names, and I hope to collect seme more. ^ (a) Shaikh Khalid al Mohamad of the Ajman (Suffran) is known as 2ielD Sabman - Dog f s penis ^ / (13) shaikh Naif al Hathlain paramount Shaikh of the Ajman is known as Abal Kilab = father of dogs. (As a child he always slept with the grey hounds). ^/(o) shaikh Mansur of the Adman (Buffran) is known as 'Khara al Dhib' - wolf's droppings. , (d) Saud ^CVbdul Aziz (King) is known as 'Abu Sharrain' a name given him in the Ajman wars, it means 'father of double mischief'. 2 . Another item of interest is the fact that the Ajman are very great lovers and breeders of grey hounds (seleugis), and a visit to an Ajman camp from this point of view is always of great interest.

I have consulted the Thaikh of Kunait with refer ence to the third paragraph of your letter and find that he would prefer not to consider the raatter at present. He points out that the Iraq tribes will not enter his territory within the next six months and, before forming an opinion, he would like to see the outcome of the coming struggle between Bin Saud and the Akhwan insurgents. If Bin iSaud wins., the Shai&amp;h says he will have a definite suggestion to make and if Bin Baudloses many fresh p obleas will have to be faced. The Political Agent at Kuwait thinks that he is in a position to get news of any big raiding party that is moving noith, and that if he could get a wireless set to tvlcjatr watrrti him to keep in touch with the Inspecting Officer, Southern Desert, or to get a call through to the Hoyal Air Porce at Shaibah, it would not be necessary to trouble the Iraq Police.

Who are these persons and how are they recruited? I used to think that Bin Saud relied on his Akhwan, whom he was settling in villages, for his troops. I think Sir gilbert Clayton once asked Bin Saud to define his 'regular forces' in the same way as we define ours, and Bin Baud found it impossible. 1 think it would be of great interest to all if yoijfcould report on the Wajd system.

As his request wasjto go to Baghdad and see High CoramisBioner, I hope I did tfight-telegraphing to Baghdad and repeating to you. Ibn Mashur had much interesting information to impart. This I shall send in the form af a despatch. I hope High Commissioner will let him go aito see him as the rebels want to know where they stand (a) if they win, (b) if they lose. So far all they know is that they cannot have supplies from Kuwait, ana may not cross the border. What they want to know and from the mouth of the High Commissioner himself is, in the case iOf eventual defeat, will they be allowed to 'hajir' to Iraq, Syria or Kuwait. The Akhwan are for ever saying they cannot pos sibly settle down under Bin Saud f s rule again ever^ and must migrate en masse out of his country if the worst hap pens. At present they are going strong and are successful all along the line. But what of tomorrow ? Ibn Mashur is a man of 38 to 40 and fanatica}, though I made him iaugh heartily several times. His bitter cry like other Akjwan is Bin Saud T s treachery. 'He has ordered us the Akhwan, to do every single thing that we have ever done, and had given us presents galore for every raid we have made dn Iraq and Kuwait. What do we get now. Our leaders have been mjfrdered, or chiefs cast into prison, and g my all/women and children and those of my following cast into jail in Hail 0 . It seems Ibn Mashur's women and children have been in Bin 3aud f s lianas for a long time. One thing 1 got out of Bin Mashur. it is that Bin Saud is at present writing to them all urging them to return I to him and forgiveness. He seems lo forget Ana forgive^all.j 'How f i&gt;il 'How can we trust him' 7 Bin Mashur said; 'Kith Dhaidan / ' murdered, Duwish treacherously shot, ibn Huiaaid in a dungeon when given the promise of God that he v ^ould be sent 'back to his tribe, my women and children prisoners and several other/ leaders cruelly executed, even though ^iven 4 safe conduct^ The capturer of the cars in the Dahana is with Ibn Mashur - a grim Ajmi with a merry eye. He assured me this a.m. that 14 cars were destroyed by him. He gave me full details of their burning and how he got 5 in one place, six in another, two in a third place and the last contain ing 8 men in a lonely spot off the track where it had got lost. He showed me a large number of cypher telegrams from Hijaz to Bin Saud, which he had captured between Hoffuf and Biat.h from fosaib^s messengers. The cyphers were English: Ibn Mashur said the road between Hasa and Hiath was entirely in their hands now. In the car incident, the only persons they spared I were Amir Saud^ old cook xh -- a grey-beard, and a Khalidi guide. Excuse more now. Your^sincerely, SI)/ H.R.P. Dickson. P.S. It seems to me the Akhwan r fed up at not having received any reply from His Majesty's Government ^o their requests contained in Faisal Duwish's letter to Shai^li Ahmad, which I passed on some time ago,-think they can ho^e for nothing definite so long as they make their requests through Shaikh Ahmad and Colonel Dickson; they therefore intend going higher and seeing King Faisal and the High Commissioner. They hope to get change there. Typically Arab method : I personally think we ought not to blockade their food supply. It is scareely playing fair. They have myriads of women and children. ItIt is a curious fact that when Bin Saud our (3^ friend was on top, we had to spend st hundreds of thousands of pounds annually to protect our frontier against his so- called mutinous Alchwan. To-day, when the latter are top- dog, we are having no trouble whatsoever anywhere. A reign of peace exists all along our frontier. So much for our friend, Bin Saud !!

The latter in his letter to Shaikh Ahoaad under reference, hag made it clear that he is speaking for all the AJman and Mutair Akhwan Shaikhs, and adds that so keen are these to get their camels to Subaihiyeh to graze, that they have sent their seals to him (Ibn Mashur), and are prepared to renew their promise not to raid •iraq. or Kuwait tribes., as well as give another undertaking in writing, to remove their camels as soon as Bin saud shows sign of moving northwards against them-. This to allay any suspicions on our part that their camels will make use of Sfibaihiyeh as a soil of house of refuge in case of hostilities near the border^ Shaikh Ahmad says that the AJman and Mutair today have vast hefirds of camels congregated in North nassa, and the grazing in consequence is getting scarcer and scarcer. The Akhwan see Just over the border the hitherto untouched grazing grounds of subaihi- fo yehjand the temptation-o# crossj^ the border is almost beyond endurancec As Shaikh Ahmad prettily puts it, ^They look upon gubaifeiyeh today as more desirable to get to than the Holy Kaaba itself'. This year no camels of the Bin Subah or anyone else have grazed at Subaihiyeh, so camel food is luxurient* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most^obedient servant, l ieut—C ol., political Agent,Kmwaitlvl I \JJI ClMglTJSHTTAT, .

The continued embassies to Kuwait and the attempt to send Ihn Mashur to Baghdad show that the Akhwan are realising their unenviable situation. Unless they can rouse the Ataihah Jaisal al Dawish is hound to he defeated. In that event Iraq or Kuwait must expeot a mass immigration of the Ajman or Mutair Aiwa accompanied 'by their women and children. 3. It is for the decision of His Majesty's Sfeaxsixs Government what action should he taken in such an event. The Royal Air Force have orders to exclude refugees flying from Ihn Saud's army, hut presumably these orders apply to the fighting men, especially Paisal bin Dawish and his chief followers.

I have passed the information about the armed cars scheme on to the Air Officer Commanding and I have asked him to write to you on the subject, which I understand he has done, I think it might save time in these questions of armaments, etc., if you, or if you think fit Dickson, were to write or telegraph direct to the Air Officer Commanding; he is, of course, the technical expert and I am merely a post office in such a subject. Moreover, he always keeps me informed of anything he is doing. I have seen the Shaikh's suggestions as to what he requires from Ibn Sa'ud. I can quite appre ciate his point of view, but I am afraid that His Majesty's Government will think his demands are rather more than they can support in view of their relations with Ibn Sa'ud, I am afraid I see very little hope of his getting his tribes back. Not only would Ibn Sa'ud be more than reluctant to let them go, but I doubt very much whether they would agree to come and renounce their allegiance to Ibn Sa'ud for the sake / trw o;^ som.*/precarious position under the Shaikh. I brought your remarks about the Special Service Officer to the notice of the Air Officer Commanding and suggested that he should deal with youdirect on the subject. I imagine you will hear from Brooke-Popham if you have not already done so, and I am sure that he will have suggested some satisfactory solution, as he is always ready to help and co-operate in all matters.

The Ataiba tribe is reported to be collect ing at Kuqba on Mecca—madh road and, in order to deal with the situation, the King hasbe en rushing —— troops to concentration camp north of Taif. Some fighting, it is reported, has already taken place. There is also good evidence to show that Ibn Saud is concentrating another force at Henakiya, north-east of Medina. Motor cars, lorries and drivers are being commandeered wholesale at Mecca and jeddah and are being sent to both camps with troops. ibn Saud is leaving Mecca for Kijcdh to-day; it is said he delayed his departure owing to necessary collecting of large force to accompany him and the insecure state of the road.

A week ago, as a result of several small raids inside Kuwait territory 'by Shammar, Shaikh Ahmad decided to patrol the well^lying along the coast to the north of Kuwait Bay, as at this time of the year the al-Subah camels and those of other Kuwaitis are concentrated in this area, and he suspected an attempt would 'be made on these Shaikh Ahmad informed me at the time that he was doing this, and incidentally expressed the hope that his patrols would not he taken for raiders 'by the Safwan Police* 2* The strength of the main patrol was 36 mounted men, and they found tracks of the raiders on the afternoon, of the 25th» following the tracks up they came upon the raiders in the evening as they were quietly rounding up a portion of a large camel he^rd near Umdaira, 4,, The raiders who numbered 19 men under Ihn Dham caught red handed and surrounded,at first showed fight, 'but surrendered after firing a few rounds. Their losses were 3 killed including Ihn 'Dham their•2 &amp; leader. 5. The prisoners, a mixed lot (some AMa some Aslam) were 'brought into Kuwait on 26th and Shaikh Ahmad told me yesterday he proposed releasing all 'but five, and sending them 'back with a protest to their paramount Shaikhs. The five, he added,would 'be retained till the 6 mares and some camels recently stolen from jahra were returned. 6. The unpleasant part of the story is that H,}?. the Shaikh says he has it on the 'best authority that the raiders who made a wide detour to the north and entered his 'borders from near Safwan, sent a messen ger to Safwan to enquire from AMul Kerim 'bin khashmaj the Shamari head of the f Iraq Desert Police,and obtained from him the minutest details ahout the goings and comings of the I'bn Subah camels, including the nights on which they slept out (1 in every 3 nights)• His Excellency quoted the incident he said to show that his suspicions and dislike of the 'Iraq, desert police had foundation in fact. I suggested to H.E. that the story had 'best 'be kept to himself^ as it was prohahly 'based on ^ gup* , and would 'be quite impossible to prove even if true, 'but Shaikh Ahmad persisted that it was txmc the truth and said he would like mention made of it to higher authority.

BUSH I RE RL „ Lb# 4- 1* 1*1 Memorandum .i/i -M-- f; In continuation of my telegram No,405 dated the 30th June 1929. ' The following points of interest are submitted, in connection with my talk with Faisal al~Shi'blan Shaikh of the Jihlan section of the Mutair. (a). Shaikh 0 Faisal I found to 'be a tall f dark man aged ahout 45 years. He wore the large white Akhwan Turban over a red Kaffiyah, He was friendly, shook hands cordially, and generally was the reverse of the fanatic, (h). His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad told me Faisal was one of the M cream w of the Mutair as regards family and was connected with the M T)ushan M family of Faisal al-Buwistu (c). According to Shaikh Ahmad, he Faisal al-Shihlan is the right hand man or wazir of al-BUwish today. He accompanied AMul Aziz al-Duwish (Azaiyiz) in the capa city of Adviser, (d). In the course of my conversation Faisal al-Shihlan stated:- (i)that they, the Akhwan were out againsi Bin Saud 'because he was trying to restrict the Bedouins 1 freedom to an unheard of extent, (ti)That Bin Saud had filled them with Religious Zeal and preached that all infidels were fair game, and the H Sheria' was the only law. But when t tey IJlterpreted the for.er-2- literally; Bin Saud had rounded on them and punished them, and when they asked that their differences ( i.e. that between the Akhwan and Bin Saud) he sfettled 'by 'Sheria Law', he Bin Saud had treacherously attacked them, (iii) That al-Duwish's plans were all going - ,u « well, and they had heard definitely / ■ A-s' t]:le AtailDa had started active t operations in the Hejaz which was / ■ what they had 'been waiting for, ' iv) That al^Duwish was anxious to camp at v&gt; &lt;1 Suhaihiyeh, purely because the Hassa wells were overcrowded 'by the many Arahs concentrated in Hassa today, and no one was at Subaihiyeh, (v) That he accepted on 'behalf of al- Buwish, Government's orders not to enter Kuwait territory 'but trusted such order was only to 'be enforced for the time 'being, as the Mutair were a Kuwait trihe of old and one of their first acts on recovering their freedom from Bin Saud would 'be to ask Ihn Subah to take them under his protection once more, (vi) He expected the Braih sections of the Mutair now camped at Hafar would shortly throw in their lot with the Akhv/an and join them. That Ihn Masaad was moving to Hafar to try and pre vent this, 'but if he did not look to himself he would 'be attacked for interference, (vii) That al*'T)uwish in his ciuarrel with' a ' if) with Bin Saud desired it to 'be understood that he had no further quarrel with • Iraq, or Kuwait and wojCbd guarantee that no further raids took place. Bin Saud had deceived them all through in this matter, and having discovered his deceit, they the Akhwan intended to fight him: no longer had they a quarrel with the Hakuma (English) ♦ Whether they were forbidden entry into British protected territories or not, he al^miwish would still not quarrel with the ' Hakuma'. (e) When I asked Faisal al-Shlblan why the Mutair so persistently attacked •Irag the last few years. He replied in these words. 'How could we help it when our grazing grounds and wells had heen taken from us and seeing that we were persistently encouraged to do so', (1). When I told him that he must definitely understand and convey to Faisal al-wwish Government's orders forbidding him to cross the Kuwait or 'Iraq ■boundaries on pain of heing homhed, he replied, 'Where is the boundary, we don't know any boundary, we have never been told anything. If you mean 'Iraq or Kuwait tribes we understand, and I tell you they are safe'. (f). H.E.Shaikh Ahmad informed me that he had given no tents to shelter Azaiziz's party who had arrived without any impedimenta. He had however sent them 5 bags of rice, half a bag of sugar, some tea and butter. He mentioned this he said lest later he be accused of sending supplies to al-Buwish, Azaiyiz and his 100 men had arrived with no supplies hoping to have found shelter in Kuwait, but as they had not been allowed to enter the city he the Shaikh of Kuwait couldn't do4 / j* i\A,. rv rw- iM^ 6 ' n * ^ V b * i -h -4- S 7 V \v do otherwise than send them some food, (g) My own opinion is that in spite of the rather 'brave face that faisal al-Shlblan was putting on things, he and his master are alarmed at the preparations Bin Saud is making and their sending Azai^iz to Kuwait was to try and get the Shaikh of Kuwait to use his influence with His Majesty's Government and if possible arrange for the Mutadr to he interned in Kuwait much as iA 1914-15^the Ajman who were in rebellion against Bin Saud, were settled at Safwan through the medium of Shaikh Mubarak« Lieut-C ol*, political Agent, Kuwait.

Sir, I have the honour to forward, for your information, translations of two letters which were given me by Abdullah bin Nafisi recently describing the so called overwhelming defeat of the A J man rebels by the Awazim at al-Ritha in Hassa. 1. From Amir o f ^atif to al-AJaji Agent of H.M.the King of Hejaz &amp; Nejd at Bahrain^dated 28th June 1929. 2. prom al~AJaji Bahrain to Abdullah al-Nafisi at Kuwait dated 1st July '2 j both letwefs speak for themselves. 2. in connection with the above affair which has been well 'boomed' by the ^osabi family at Bahrain as well as by the Agent of Bin Saud in Kuwait, both H-E.Shaildi Ahmad al-jabir as-Subah and i have taken pains to try and discover the real truth^and our independant observations have enabled us to ar ive at the following which i believe to be more or less the . 3. It will be recollected that in my telegram No.385 dated 14th June I reported that the A J man had started south, very secretly, on a big raid destination unknown. The raiders were delayed for some days in the vicinity of Nta, by the arrival of al-Duwish at jariya al-Hya, but latfcr proceeded according to prear anged plan^ and it was this party which attacked the Awazim near al-Ritha li days journey from jubail. As usually is^ the case the incident has been magni-: ■ maginfied greatly by tiie partizans of Bi n Saud especially the losses supposed to liave been inflic/ed on the Rebels. 5 a The facts would seem to be as follows On the 26th June the Ajman raiders^who were about 1200 strong, attacked the Awazlm, who were expecting them and ready, in a violent dust storm. Before the actual- attack the A J man were able to round up, capture and drive off several thousand sheep and many camels the property of 1 the Awazim. These they have successfully brought back to Wafrah. 4. The attack on the Awazim camp was carried out with complete disregard of ordinary pre cautions ^entirely care- A. lessly, and as the stoiy goes not in 'Akhwan' style (which is to '^ereba' the camels and horses, shackle them 6o that they cannot stampede, and thai to advance shoulder t o shoulder on foot). This over confidence on the raiders 1 part was their undoing, for charging forward raggedly, each man intent on personal loot they suddenly came under heavy rifle fire from trenches. This was too much for them, and they broke and fled headlong, leaving some 2^ score dead on the ground including many horses and camels . Had the Awazim followed up the enemy's discomfiture by an immediate counter attack they would have without doubt inflicted a crushing victory on the rebels, but they remained passive in camp and never moved. This is the reason why the AJman were able to bring back so much loot unmolested^ and recover nearly all their wounded. 5. The discomfited raiders retired to the village of Nta to take counsel, having lost 5 standards including that ■ x- of Ibn Maahur. The AJman casualties were 54 killed and some loo wounded (through the latter figures are hard to get at exactly) . No leaders at all were killed or wounded on either side. 6. The Awazim losses in men were few probably not more than 15 killed^ though several women and children are believed to have been shot because of the concentrated nature of their camp , which was more or less in square rformation. ■7. At Nata a violent quarrel took place between Ibn Mashur and Na if-abal-Klab the new Shaikh of the A J man. The former aooused the latter of being alone responsible for the disoomfiture, and publicly stated that he would lead in •future, some hot heads were for trying their isatoisalt luck against the Awazim again but ibn Mashur disauaded theml ) 8. The leaders next moved north to paisal al-Duwisl^s camp to report events, and the latter advised them on to go home with the loot they had gained and be satisfied. 'I will take charge and issue order in future' he is reported to have said. The meeting between the leaders and al-Duwish took place at Bamudh. 9. The failure to take advantage of their victory by the Awazim is accounted for by the fact that the Awazim are not a warlike tribe. They are not from among the Badiat- al-Ashraf. They are mostly sheep tribesmen, and their motto is 'live and let live'. They never raid and are very harm less. At the same time they hav e the reputation of being like 'wil d boar' when attacked in their homes, and defending their women and children, on such occasions they have been known to show superb courage. Iq. A curious point of the story and one which may be usefully noted should Bin saud bring an accusation against Ibn subah is the following;- in th e telegram from Abdullah bin jaloui to an-Nafisi, Been by me personally, and reported in my ^0.404 dated 29th J june 1929 , it was distinctly stated that the standard of His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait had been captured and sent to Riath. In the telegram stated to have been sent (see al-AJaji's letter to Nafisi attached) no mention is made cf atolL such standard; only some fidawiyehs of Ibn Subah are mentioned - one must suspect some one in B a ^ain, of having addres ed- iiie paragraph in questiont probably a member of the ^osaibi family did it.

We beg to inform you of, and to ape ounce to you the good news of the victory which God has graciously conferred upon the Maslimin;messengers arrived to-night from the Awazim, they report that they met the Ajman and their allies at the watering place called al-Ridha on the morning of Monday the 16th Muharram (25-6-29) at half past one o*clock (Arabic), andf ound them at work digging well, but their camp horses and camels were not at the said watering place (but some way beyond). jhe Awazim thereupon left them, and attacked their camp and animals, and the Awazim horsemen surrounded the Ajman, whose horses and animals they took, fought with them and supported by Qod the Awazim routed the Ajman and their allies and killed many of them; those who escaped were very few, and their leaders Naif Abu al-KUlab, Ibn Mashur and his slave, al-Faqum and his nephew Barjas ad-Duhaina and his son, Nagir ibn jum 9 ah, ipn H0.shBhah, t two men of al -Subuq, ibn Mikhial, Abu Jinniyah, Abu Khish- aiyah and Abu Dhain's cousin were also killed, the slaugh ter amounts to 600 men from the Ajman, but the Awazim, by the grace of Ood, did not lose more than fifteen men, none of whom were famous and thirteen horses. Seven Bairaqs were captured 6 of which were sent to Hassa and Ibn Mashur 1 s Ba^iraq with his turban hanged on, was brought to us. We ask the Almighty to give victory to and to help the religion by the existence of our Lord the imam. The killer of Ibn Mashur and his slave is Muhammad as-gahali.(Translation of a letter dated the 23rd of Muharrani 1348 (1-7-29) from Muhanmad bin Abdul Aziz al-Ajaji,Bahrain to / Abdullah bin Hamad an-Naf isi, Kuwait. After oompliments. We beg to announce to you the good news of the * favour which ood has graciously conferred upon the Maplimin by the destruction at the hand of the Awazim of those mischievous rebels, the AJman, ibn Mashur, and those who follow their deps and form that unjust and disgraced party. The matter in detail is that the rebels proceeded to re^id, as you know, and their face was towards the Awazim, but by the grace and good assistance of Qod who blessed the Awazim, and made them to be aware of the AJman while they were busy digging wells at the watering place, which was at a little distance from their camp and animals; seeing the AJman -adaja working at these watering holes those Awazim who were near to them attacked their camp, and took it altogether with the horses aid camils, they attacked the Ajman^ camp with 600 horses each carrying two men, the rest of them surrounded the AJman, fought with them and routed them after killing 700 men of them. The news was brought here by way of Q,atif on the afternoon of the 2oth Muharram (28-6-29) as per a letter from ibn Suwailim, and the combat took place at al-Ridha , which is one and a half days from JUbail on Monday the 17th instant (26-6-29). As soon as we got Ibn Suwailim 1 s letter we sent a brief telegram to you giving this good news to tranquillize you, the r eply to same has been received from you. The letters of our Master Abdullah Ibn Jeloui (Amir of Bassa) which includes the details reached us on the 21«t Muharram (29-6-29) and we duly sent you the following telegram under his signature;- 'An-Hafisi, Kuwait. - The AJman, Mashur, ad-Dahna, ar-Eufudi, al-jiblan, al-Fuq.um, ar-Rishaidah and Ibn subah 1 !

Dated the 7th july 1929 Lieutenant-Colonel H.R.P.Dickson, C*I*E*, political Agent, Kuwait To The Hon l ble the political Resident in the persian Qalf, sushireo Letters from Faisal ad-Duwish to H.J]. the Shaikh of Kuwait. Sir, 1929, ani my telegram No.402 dated 28th June 1929. I have the honour t o forward translations of two interesting and important letters received by H.E. the Shaikh of Kuwait from Shaikh Faisal ad-Duwish dated 17th and 25th June 1929 respectively. The first is rather old history» and was referred to in my 394 mentioned above, but the second is of recent date and was brought by 'Azayiz' (Abdul Aziz) the son of Shaikh Faisal when he visited Kuwait. It also was referred to in my telegram No.402 mentioned above, though when my telegram was sent off, I had only received a verbal report of its contents from the Shaikh and I never realized what highly interesting matter it contained until H.E. the Shaikh brought the original along and read it out to me three evenings ago. I immedia- tly asked him to let me have a copy of both letters as received from -the famous Akhwan leader c Faisal^ second letter as will be seen is the inter esting one and throw® much new light on recent happenings in the d 6861 ^ as w ell as on Akhwan policy and aspirations. The remarkable part about the letter is the offer made by Faisal to H.E. the Ruler of Kuwait to take on the mantle of Ibn gaud and become the imam of the Mussalmin.-2- SI in this oonneotion it may not be amiss to say that Shaikh Ahmad bin jabir is for all praotioal purposes, a mild Wahabi already* He never smokes nor drinks, and in reoent times has done much to oleanse Kuwait of many of tie abuses to do with morality which used to be levelled at her in particular by Ibn saud and the Akhwan. guoh things as the playing of gramaphones and other musical instruments in public or private has been banned long ago, and smoking is taboo wherever His Excellency iws One final point i wish to bring out before r close this,it is that whenever a letter passes between important Arab leaders - a verbal message ' mi n al Has illa l Ras ' is always added and delivered faithfully by the messenger. r / nphis is for safety^ sake and is an old established custon. I mention this as the contents of my report 402 of 28th June for instance^ contains much more than is actually stated in .paisal ad-Duwish^s lettero i have the honour to be..

I.E., Ruler of Kuwait. After oompliments• Gods blesBings on you. You laiow what has happened between us and Ibn Saud, and how the ohosen ones of Ibn Baud 1 s Army partly visited you, and are partly now with us. As for the rest of his army, it is now in process of revolting from him. Among these latter are the Ataiba, who have risen as one man, both Bedouin and Townsmen, owing to his evil action of communications with them, this is the revenge of ood, he it is who has caused the people to break away, they have not done it of themselves. Uow is your chance, if you are a man with the like ambitions that Ibn saud had, for^we, Ibn saud's army and soldiers has Qoci put into your hands .You must for your part tell us, what you are able to do, and what you are not able to do for you alone know exectly what the High Government 1 s wishes and orders are. Ag' to us (the Akhwan) we want your protection and nothing more, we want you to tell us where we may not go, and what boundaries we must not trespass on. we will obey, protect us and make out frontiers for us^ and we will not disobey you. Our one d^esire is that you become the medium between us and the high Government, in exactly the same way as Ibn gaud was our go between in matters that affected or befell us. You are now no longer short of soldiers^ or wealthy if God gives you strength. We are camped at ,, ^ruwal ,, until we receive your reply- We would like to come to subaihlyeh and Mitlaq as Sur is proceeding to you. please reply soon.

After compliments. Your honoured lettershave besn receivedx. We have stated, God give you blessing, certain things in our pre vious letter, and we asked for a reply, tout we have not received in your letter any reply to what we mentioned, you remember that 'the rest of the reply'* (main business) was to have been given verbally by you to Mutlaii. al—Sur, and the latter was to have delivered it to me himself, but as-Sur has not brought any special message from you. We now require information on certain matters from you, you must desire likewise from us. Our message to you is this,s- Firstly we wish you to agree with us in our beliefs and tenets of Is lame Secondly we invite you to be the imam over the great army (Akhwan) which Q-od has put into your handsi and to become the medium (wasta) between us and the British Go vernment (hal hakuma) in matters that may affect or befall us your subjects. As far as fighting with Ibn Saud and the people of Hejd is concerned we excuse you from taking part and only desire from you the thing that you can assist us with (allow us to obtain supplies?) We are strong and confident in the help of Qod, but you know that Ibn Saud has split the people in twain, by gifts of money and which he continues to shower on them more and more. . Do not yourself therefore be stingy with your new peo ple and you will not want for wealth in this world^for suoh will indeed now oome to you from three sources. a) in the form of salaries for Nejd tribes hitherto received from the High British aovernmenb. ^^(b) in the shape of ^aisat from us the tribes 0 (o) By means of our raids and attacks the one fifth share (khums) of which will be asggt set aside for you. As regards any past claims you have against us and which you are still sore about, I sent (my son) Abdul A^iz who represents me in all matters to discuss them. He will speak as from me. For the rest when we settle in our permanent camp., I shall Ood willing^ome and pay you a visit Regarding the Ataibah, after our leaving Hejd, they raided Ibn Saud^ camels and took them. Should you further desire to be the means of helping al-sharif (King Faisal) to raise a war in Hijaz by means of the Ataiba do not be slow in advising him, lastly we say that nothing will satisfy us for a camp but Subaihiyeh, ani we know that you turned other people away from it solely in order to keep it for us, never the less we do not want to come to it, except by permission, 1 have instructed Abdul Aziz to bring me back your news and good report to Hamadh where I am proceedings You know of my life long friendship with your father. Ibrahim bin Mizaiyin (your standard bearer) knows of it well and can tell you. You were a small child then and doubtless will not remember. For that old friendships sake I tell you to ex^ep-t that everything good will come to you^ arti by Ood's grace all the old power and glory which Kuwait once wielded will return to her once more. Oh my son Ahmad do not remain inactive now, be brave, and rise, since God has given you this force which is now yours. Remember that Bin Saud only succeeded by the help of this force (Akhwan), his circumstances you knew of before. Ihis is what j have to write, and the rest of the message you will hear from Abdul A^iz and Faisal bin Shablan. Usual Ending./- Vg5 No 11^ political Agenoy, Emwait Dated tbe 6tii jaly 1929.

Dear Dickson, Wire news of urgent importance to the High Coinraissioner, as it may affect Royal Air Force dis positions for the defence of Iraq and Kuwait. You must remember hov/ever that the Royal Air Force have their own Special Service Officer. There is no necessity however to send High Commissioner copies of other letters, of great interest ■ v though no immediate urgency, such as your nos. 412 and All. por one thing the political Resident ia much I more likely to be sympathetic towards Shaikh Ahmad*s aspirations than the High Commissioner in Baghdad. Both the Political Resident and the High Gommissioner have equal access to the Secretary of State for the Colonies and when all the information on which he can base a report has already gone direct to High Commissioner the Political Resident cannot help feeling that the ground has been cut findet his feet. It is of little use to report to London information whic) has already been received by them with naturally a slight Iraq flavouring. The fact that Baghdad knows as much as Bushire will support the demand that is sure to come that the Political Agent Kuwait should be placed directly under the High Commissioner Iraq. This, so far as 1 am aware^ is not the policy of the Gov ernment of India and we should do nothing to he^p it. Yours sincerely, SD/ C.CTJ. Barrett.

This course has been very successful and may have caused him to assume a more gloomy out-look on life.

The day we arrived at Sadawi we received news from our people to say that they (Abu Hahaik and the Dhafir ?) attacked Sinam, their advanced guard camping at Saliba; whereupon we marched against them. -Being, however, afraid that they were on Ibn Sabah's side, we sent out messengers to Ibn Sabah and he said 'they are not my subjects nor does he (Abu Hanaikf) enjoy my protection' 1 . It is now six days since I sent them 'Abdullah al Jabir to advise (or warn) them to look after (or not to molest ?) our advanced detachments. The latter, you will note, are all behind them. We marched past them, and I despatched a force against 'Adhawiyeh. I told them not to be brightened as we ha.d authority from Ibn Sabah, and that, inshallah, their detachments need fear nothing whatever. All our efforts and Patchings are for your sake. When we advanced against them I sent Sa^un ibn Kraish and Khalid ibn Elaanfar and men of Ibn Sabati's, and told them to go by motor car from Jahrp and call on Ibn SabaJn and that, if they found that the people belonged to him, we would withdrew. They returned presently and told us teat he (Ibn Sabah ?) ha.d said j-iist, namely, that they were not in his 'Dakht or dimmah' (not entitled to his - Ibn Sabah's ? . protection or help). so we met them at Salikhat. where we find them halted. God granted us the victoryvictory over them. Our casualties were 12 horses 4 men and 12 camels. The day we left them Gharib ibn Jasar with two motor cars pursued us and, approaching us, told us that the Shaikh sends us his greetings and said that the cursed fello?/, when he heard of the fighting, wired to ±5asrah. We were previously concealing it from him, but they followed tracks on the soft ground as far as Tash. Then 7 aeroplanes came after us, and Ghareeb was with us in the motor car of Ibn Sabah, We were bombed for about 2 hours but we came to no harm. U./e.

M. I. 10.(np /o (Received under endorsement Ho. S.O. 1381, dated 10-7-29 fron the Oriental Secretary to H.E. the High Goin- miscioner for Iraq. Baghdad). Confidential .'C'. The Residency, Baghdad, dated 24th Tune, 1929. Sir, I have the honour to request a reference to telegram Ho.119 dated the 14th of Tune, 1929, from the British Agent and Consul at Tiddah to the Foreign Office and to submit the following observa tions on the alleged activities of Faisal, cousin of Naif i'bn Humaid. 2. Naif ibn Humaid is a pretender to the chief tainship of the 'Ataibah tribe which is at present held by his first cousin Sultan. In 1923 Naif and a minor relation Ubaid got into trouble in Na.jd and with a number of other Najdi tribesmen took refuge in »Iraq. In 1925 on account of their raids from 'Iraq into Najd all these refugees were removed from the southern desert and. brought up into the Dulaim Liwa. Since then Naif and Ubaid have been living on a small piece of land not far from Samarra to the north of Baghdad. 3^ On the 3rd Tune I received a telegram from the Honourable the Resident at Bushire informing me that Ubaid ibn Humaid had arrived in Kuwait from Baghdad The Right Hon'ble Sidney .'.Tabfe, P.C. . Secretary of State for the Colonies ^owning Street, London. S. a .I.A J Kl -o- Baghdad a few days earlier and had gone on to Wafrah with letters for the Akhwan insurgents there. This report no doubt concerned the same man as the Tiddah telegram to which I have referred in the first para graph of this despatch, in which Uhaid was erroneously called Faisal. 4. From the enquiries which I made I ascertained that, on the strength of a recommendation given to him by the Royal Diwan, tTbaid ihn Humaid was issued with a travel permit to Kuwait by the Passport Bureau Baghdad on the 23rd May. On the 30th May he arrived in Kuwait and at once went on to Wafrah where, it is reported, he delivered letters to Ibn Mashhur, one of the Hajdi insurgents there. He returned to Kuwait on the Ist June and travelled via Basrah to Bagdad where he arrived on the 3rd Tune. 5. There was therefore strong circumstantial evidence to confirm the suspicions which the Naid Government had exposed to the British Agent at T iddah. I accordingly wrote a personal and private letter to King Faisal acquainting him with the reports which had been made concerning his use of Ubaid as a messenger to the insurgent ITa.jdis and asked His Majesty to enlighten me as to the real facts, g. His Majesty's reply, of which I have the honour to enclose a copy in translation, provides an explanation o^ Ubaid 1 s movements which, while it may still leave a suspicion that perhaps the whole truth hashas not been told, fits the facts as they are known to us and, in a measure, His Majesty's story is confirmed by the fact that once previously early in 1927 Ubaid ibn Humaid, at the invitation of Ibn Sa'ud himself went from 'Iraq to Najd to discuss the possibility of Naif's re-assuming the paramountcy of the ' Ataibah tribe. Naif however in spite of attractive promises from Ibn Sa'ud, refused the chance and preferred ''c remain in 'Iraq where he is undoubtedly treated well by the King. 7, Whatever may be the truth of the purpose of Ubaid 1 s visit to Wafrah I believe that the King was perturbed by the revelation of my knowledge of his mov?iaents and I trust that the publicity which has been given to this incident, may deter him from attempting any form of direct interference in Najdi tribal affairs. I would suggest that this master be allowed to drop by His Majesty's Agent in Tiddah, unless the Eijazi minister for Forelr^ Affairs refers to it again, in which case he might be given such of the information contained in this despatch and enclosure as His Majesty's Agent in Tiddah may deem suitable and sufficient. 8 , I am sending a copy o^ this despatch to His Majesty's Agent and Consul, -Tiddah. I have the honour to be, C! t r* blx f Your most obedient, hurnb 1 e s e r v an t, Sd. Gilbert Clayton, High Commissioner for 'Iraq.7 L.--' i.n A persona l . Tlis Hoy?il Court, t\to, 16/Ya &gt; The - iwan » Baghdad,20th Tune, 1929, I&gt;ear Sir Gilbert, I thank Your Sxoellsnoy for your private and personal letter which you have so kindly sent to me on the 16th Tune and in which you allude to the recent protest hy Ihn Sa'ud. Your Excellency may feel personally assured and may assure His Majesty Ifen Sa'ud that it has never occurred to me to under take any action against him at present, in the same way as I had done nothing of the sort at the most critical time for him when he was confronted with the greatest trouble such as that with Ihn Hamid and the Dawish. I 'believe that the report which has reached Ihn Sa'ud is distorted and exaggerated, and it is important that I should acquaint you with the course of events in order to allay all doubts Shaikh Ha if ibn Ham id, who is the legal heir to the Shaikhdom of the •Ataitah Trite, came to Baghdad * years ago, sought refuge with us and has teen in -Iraq since then. He was compelled to emigrate from his country owing to the oppression he was subjected to ty his cousin Sultan ibn Bujad who had usurped his Shaikhdom with the assistance of His Majesty Ibn Sa'ud. A month or more ago Shaikh Half received a telegraphic message emanating from Kuwait and signed by Kaq'ad Al-Buhamah, asking him to go over to Kuwait to see him. Following the receipt pf this telegram Shaikh Half came to me and asked for my advice in the matter. I told him in reply that, while not desirous of interfering in such matters and of bringing pressure to bear upon his personal liberty after the disappearance of his antagonist (rival^/4 {2} (rival ?)in a case relating to the recovery of a right which he had lost, I did not consider it advisable, having regard to rec^rt events in Na.jd, that he should proceed forthwith 'before receiving sufficient details and ascertaining the true facts ahout the situation. In pursuance of this (advice) he decided to send a person on his 'behalf to ascertain facts from the sender of the telegram. He eventually sent ♦TTbaid ibn H amid (or Humaiyid ), one of his followers and family connections. We did not know at the time that the sender of the telegram was with Ihn Mashhur, as it never occurred to any 'body that I'bn Mashhur would remain a rehsl against His Majesty Ihn Sa'ud after the latter*s great victory over his opponents. 'Ubaid went to Kuwait and it was there that he came to know that Maq'ad was with I'bn Mashhur. Havingjalready suffered the fatigues of the journey to Kuwait, 'ITbaid saw no objection to his proceeding by car, lust as any other person and without any secrecy, to meet Maq'ad. On return from his journey 'Ubaid. told Naif that the latter's tribe were awaiting him. When Naif reported the news to me I told him that I was prepared to give him an opportunity (or leave) to return to his tribe, as I could not see that I had any right to restrict the liberty of a guest of mine, but that I considered his departure in the existing circumstances to be prejudicial to my interests, -^or if I allowed him to go I must bestow upon him such mark of honour as was due to him in accordance with Arab customs, which, if done, might be interpreted by the other party in a manner inconsistent with the original intention, while if I let him go without such mark of honour it would be derogatory to my position and his in the eyes of Arab tribes. In view of these considera tions and as I wish to a^oid anything calculated to give rise to misunderstanding,misunderstanding, I advised Naif to decline their (his tribes ?) invitation temporarily until the situation has stabilised and the atmosphere is cleared up, adding that he might, if he so wished, send a messenger to them to inform them of the facts of the case and that he (Haif) has, of his own choice and in order not to lose his position among the tribes, declined to go over for the time being. Shaikh Naif accepted my advice and resolved to remain in 'Iraq with his people in the vicinity of Samarrah, Such are the facts of the case which I give in detail above (or in advance) in order that Your Excellency may learn how the case progressed.

I &gt; . ... ■ waJ intelligenoe - Rebel oonoentration« MEMORANDUM Four days ago H.E. the shaikh of j^uwait sent a particu larly reliable man to visit the oampg of the AJman, ibn Mashur and Faisal al-Duwish. The man's role was to gain information on matters connected with supplies, ammunition, food and morale. His excuse for visiting the rebels was to deliver a further message from the shaikh of Kuwait warning them finally not to oiposb the border into Kuwait territory, whether victorious or defeated, and/advising them if they / could^to move away from the 'temptation* of Subaihiyeh. The messenger returned 'this morning and the following is a precis of his news;- (1) Faisal al-Duwish visited Wafra and the ^ Ajman leaders on the 9th July alone. H© commenced by renewing all oaths that he had already made^to stand by the Ajman^S^i an d got the Ajman and Ibn Mashur to do likewise* (2-)- Faisal then diplomatically asked Naif al Hithlain to accept the leadership of the Akhwan forces. The offer was refused, as Faisal expected it would be. (3) Faisal next announced his intention of moving south and away from the Neutral Zone, of which Wafra forms the centre;he complained that the water and grazing was not enough for the Mutair who were maioy. (4) The Ajman insisted on doing likewise and in the messenger's view, both tribes wouldi '\n{ strike south in a day or two - objective the better oonditions 50 or 60 miles south There they would halt, scatter and occupy ths wells over a very wide area» (5) When jaisal returned to his camp he took the Shaikh of Kuwait's messenger along with him, and on arrival there he collected all the Akhwan, and in a long harrangue, told them he had decided on the advice of jbn Subah to move away from Shattaf and the Kuwait frontier. He attached no blame to Ibn Subah, whatsoever, who had to obey the English f though at heart he knew he was their - friend and always would be. For the latter^ sake he intended leading the whole Ajman and Mutair 3 days Journey south. (6) He then publicly announced that the Mutair could raid where they liked and in whatever strength they liked, provided it was not against # iraq or Kuwait. Against these two territories raiding was absolutely forbidden under pain of his most serious displeasure, (7) Faisal al-Duwish then informed his audience that he was not angry with theAwazim for their acts against the Ajman, as the fault was not theirs, nevertheless because the Ajman and the A^hwan generally had been put to shame at the al-Ritha fight, he would send to them, the Awaaim and offer them peace and forgiveness if they agreed to move north, and to the rear of the Ajman and Mutair. ^here they could do no harm, and would find safety ' for themselves. Irfcront of them they were a danger to themselves (the Akhwan) and would be unable to avoid fighting for Bin Saud.if the Awaalm refused his, Faisal's offer, he would attack and destroy them. This was the last chance he would give then.(8) Tiie messenger fourth e: reported that £T&amp;isal had sent a message to the cautions Ibn Shuqair al-jariyah al-jlya offering him three courses of action. (a) to come to Join him. (b) to go and Join Bin saud* (c) To depart from jariya in case he chose (b) else he would be raided. She mes enger thinks ibn Shuqair will Join the rebels. (9) The morale of the rebels was high, said the messenger. Ihey had plenty of am munition, food and clothing but were practically all without tents except the Ajman, paisal himself was living in a tent d'atori made out of 2 small carpets. His Excellency shaikh Ahmad who brought me the above news, this morning, gave it as his opinion that the move south meant trouble for someone. He thought it was the * r Awazim, but considered they had a fair chance of safety if they accepted al-Duwish's advice and 'trekked' ^orth. in the latter case they possibly would come to Wafra or gubaihiyeh.

RtUUiiUcj. ; { Visit of Akhwan Leaders to Kuwait on 18th July 1929. Sir, I ha to the honour to make the following report to you;- Last night about 8.30 p.m. I was informed that al-puqm (Mutair) and Hfcizam al-Bathlain (AJman), two of the most important of the Akhwan leaders today, with about 20 men, had arrived outside Kuwait and desired to see me. His Excellen cy the Shaikh I was told had refused to allow them to enter the city, considering it would be a good thing to interview the men, I sent round and asked sheikh Ahmad if he had any objection to my doing so. He immediately acquiesced urging me at the garnet ime to give them the same warding that I had given to Shaikh j^isal al-Shiblan who came in with 'Azaiyiz' al-Duwish some time back. gphis morning therefore at 6 a,m^ accompanied by Captain Burton, special Service Officer, Basrah, and Sheikh Abdullah bin jabir, commander of the Loc a l porces, I went out to see the Akhwan chiefs. a special tent had been pitched for them among some 'Hathar' AJman tents, which lie to the South West of the g?own. I was greeted in very friendly fashion by both Haaam bis Hathlain and al-Fuqm, who with their escort came out to meet i me. ( Al-Faqm was about 60 years of age with long beard dyed t henna colour, whilst Hazam was a man of about 35 years old. Both Chieftains and all their followers wore large white new turbans* over red kaffiyah|^ # leaders were well dressedand carried BwordB, their followers were also well dressed and were all armed with. Mauser 275 rifles except one man who had a.3o3 short rifle. The whole seamed well fed and very much alive. Of the leaders Hazam al-Hathlain appeared to be of the fiery impatient type, al-Fuqm the quieter and more sensible. A precis of the conversation which was direct between myself and them is given below in the form of separate ,para- A graphs, each leader putting questions to me in turn. (a) 3?hey had come they said to inform the British Government of the reasons which bad led them into rebellion against Bin gaud. This was nothing more than the latter•s 'treachery' with them. They were plain men who prefeiced plain dealing and the Truth. Bin gaud had tjrfaught them Religion and today, thanks be to Gfod, they knew how to appreciate the Truth and honest dealing. Bin saud had ordered them to raid •Iraq and Kuwait times without number and as soldiers they had carried out his orders to the letter. (I here interjected that perhaps Bin saud had not himself given the orders, but that they had taken their instructions from someone else. This they hotly denied saying they the Akhwan leaders accepted no orders except from Bin gaud^ own mouth). (b) Then came the English they said who began to com plain to Bin Saud and started demanding back stolen sheep camels etc. to this Bin saud gave answer that they his Akhwan were out of hand and he could not very well control them. Actually he again and again had ordered them to continue their raiding and took the 'khumus'^ 1/5 of all the loot they got. (c) Eventually under pressure from the English Bin saud had demanded that they should hadd back their share of the loot to him, and he would return same to •Iraq. Their reply to him had been 'Yes we will do this and loyally obey your orders but you must do likewise.as our leader'.They had also wanted to know how it was that while it suited his convenience he Bin saud had quoted to them by Chapter and Verse from the i Koran, the virtue of Jehad and attacking non-Akhwan and Mushriq tribes, and how it was that he was now asking them7 to return to the infidel what he had preached was lawful: they demanded that Bin Saud should explain this: Bin Saud for his part had promiaed to explain all to them at sabillah, and when they went there, by a gross prece of treachery, he had attacked them, killed several of their leaders on the spot^wounded al-Duwish (and incidentally taken his seal) and lastly had cast ibn Humaid of the Ataiba into prison where he was now languishing. (d) Not satisfied with this Bin gaud had sent Pa^ad ' bin jaloui to seize Dhaidan bin Hathlain one of the big three Akhwan leaders who had not attended the Conference. When ibn Hathlain refused to come and meet Fahad, the latter sent him a l®tter giving 'the oath of God' that he only wished to see him and discuss matters, and that he would send him hack safe. Against the wishes of the tribal lea^ders and particularly against his Hazam al-Hathlain 1 » advice % Dhaidan went and met pahad. thereupon he was treacherously seized and cast into irons and latter had his throat cut by Jlahad •s own hand, shortly after he Bazam had attacked Fahad's camp in order to save his cousin. God had punished jahad for his treachery by me^ns of him Hazam, but pahad was only carrying out the orders of his master the arch-traitor, and the arch- renegade to the Religion namely Abdul Aziz al-Saud.(Here Hazam showed me the original letter from pa had to Dhaidan giv«t ing him 'H&amp;th wa bakht' in the name of Qod). (e) The two above- acts of treachery they added and the general playing into the hands of the English by Bin Saud whose servant he had apparently become, had stired up the whole of tile Akhwan of north Nejd. All had sworn to throw off yoke. Ataibah and Harb were leading the Akhwan Hejaz way, and the Mutair and Ajman were doing the same in the Bast, in a short time the whole of Najd would be in revolt they said. (f) Here I asked where Bin Saud was, and the reply was, 'he has been forced back to the Hejaz^ he cannot reach either (^asim or Riath, only 4 day s ago special messengers reached us from ^ahtan, Ataiba and Bar© to the effect that If■ • T \ I they had. been oompletely successful in blocking the way If from Hejaz. (g) i asked, if it was true that they were moving South from wafra and Shathaf. They said perfectly true, and half of them had already moved off. (h) I asked what were their intentions wiih the Awazim: al-Paqm replied that they had sent them an offer to n gudaiyan ' (Join the Akhwan) or be attached. a?tLey had as yet had no reply, but they had heard that Awazim had XE±a retired towards Hoffuf. (i) So my query, asto what their losses had. been at al-Ritha (where they had attacked the Awazim) al-puqm re plied '22 men killed no Sheikhs hurt on either side' . To their regret their rifle^ fire had killed several women among the Awazim, but that was pure accident, as the Awazim were closely packed in Zeraba formation when they received their attack. (J) When I asked if it was true that they had raided as far as 'Saad al-Rimadan 11 , 'Abu Jiffan' and 'Bamban' close to Riath, they replied 'Yes and we have brought back much loot and many of Bin Saud's own camels'. (k) When I questioned them as to what they really wanted from me, they at last came to the point and said that they came for two things (i) They the Akhwan desired to enter into a sort of treaty engagement with the / British, the treaty to b e formally written out and signed by their leaders; in the ducoment they would promise t o remain on friendly terms with 'Iraq, and Kuwait, and would undertake not to attack either Govern-!' ment or raid any of their tribes. (ii) In return they desired to be allowed to make use of Kuwait and to purchase supplies and munitions from it. (1) Kuwait had been their port from time immemorial.~ 5 ~ (&amp; ) /tCf I Tiiey looked upon themselves as Kuwait tribes and only wished to retiaxn to their own. fhey thought they were strong enough to be called a small nation now and Just as Kuwait had done, they wished to make a direct treaty with the British if possible. (m). When I told them that their's was quite an im possible request, and under no circumstances whatever could % His Majesty^ Government do such a thing, they naively asked if they could come under the shaikh of Kuwait•s Jurisdiction, fo this I also gave a negative reply. (n) I was then asked to explain eaactly the British e Government's wishes as some of theifcr friends would not be abl 1 % to understand why their offer of friendship was refused. I ^ replied in detail to the effect that as the Akhwan were in open rebellion against their Ruler, and that as their Ruler was our friend and in treaty relations with us, we could not but stand by him and ksfigt promised to assist in the following way;- (i) By denying supplies to them, the Rebel^ Akhwan. (ii )By refusing them entry, under any circumstances whatever, into either Kuwait or 'Iraq territory. (0) I added that aeither Sheikh Ahmad nor J desired their blood or that of their women on our heads, but that as sure as they attempted to put foot across the border they would be bombed. Beyond this the British Govemmenb had no concern, and they would be quite safe anywhere across the tlB boarder. (p) I finally added that the Shaikh of Kuwait was only car tying out His Majesty^ Government 1 s orders, and that any denial of supplies was not his fault but ours. (q) Eo their rather foolish request about making a treaty with us, I pointed out the absurdity of such talk, gpheir fight was with Bin Saud our friend. We were lookers on merely, when the fight was over there would doubtless be other talk, whichever side came^ successful. I however warned then to mafce their peace with Bin Sand before it was(g; A* too late. Tliey appeared rather amused than otherwise at this. (r) Throughout out talk both Shaildas were «xtremely friendly and at the end of my exposition of the situation al-puqm thanked me and exclaimed /'we iai^w we should get the truth from you, English, who are like us Akhwan. We quite see the attitude of the shaikh of Kuwait and excuse him entirely. We also see the English point of view and your desire to keep out of Nejd quarrels. Let us leave it at that, perhaps, if Qod wills and when we have done with the House of Saud, you will have other advice and talk for us; i in the meantime tell your Qovemmait that they need have no thing to fear from us Akhwan now, either in the direction at u •Iraq or Kuwait. fhis closed our interview and I returned to the fown. (s) [She impres8ion j gathered was that the Akhwan were J beginning to feel the pinch of hunger, though none of then atfci showed it. One argiiment they brought forward and i/tfiich I have not mentioned above was to the ef ect that they recognized we had eveiy right to stop ammunition and rifles from coming to them, but ttat surely we had no right to stop food from their women and children who were veiy many.
