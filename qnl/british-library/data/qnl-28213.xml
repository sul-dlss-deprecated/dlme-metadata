Mr. Walton's telegram of 31st July 1935 (flagged at P.Z.5217/35 in file attached) ; mentioned in the Government of India's express letter* suggested that no announcement should be made in the Indian press similar to one made in the ’’Islah” with regard to the purchase of 5000 rifles by Afghanistan from the British Government in 1935* The Afghan Government might now have objections ^ hJtwaK'k Ki to the large amount they are at present spending on arras being made available to the public; it is therefore submitted that the Government of India might be asked not to publish the figures of arms exports either from the U.K.(undesirable in any case) or from other foreign countries to Afghanistan# The Foreign Office and War Office have agreed orally to this being done.

The Afghan Grovemment do not wish to send an officer to the Rawalpindi Arsenal, but are prepared to send an officer to Landi Kotal to take over the replacements of the defective parts, and deficiencies in the consignment of 5,000 rifles supplied to than by the Covemment of India in August 1935. This officer will report at Landi Kotal on any date convenient to the Government of India and will be prepared to sign for the articles taken over as correct and in good order. The Afghan Government are prepared to accept sealed packages and will trust us to see that they are correct. It is therefore suggested that the packages be handed over sealed, and a copy of the list of the contents of each package sent to this Legation. This method of handing over will avoid possible difficulties in recognising the various parts by the officer taking over the replacements.

I am desired to enclose a copy of a note 2. dated the 18th kay 1936, which I recorded after discussion of the case with you during your last visit to Simla. Ac regards the first paragraph of this note, enquiries shoT that under the ordinary rules of procedure it is not incumbent on th« Imperial Bank to report c?.8es in'which receipt of amounts creditable to Government account is refused by it to any Government authority. The Agent, Imperial Bank of India, Peshawar Cantonment, nae, however, been advised by the Comptroller, forth Test frontier Province, to consult his office if the former thinks a formal objection to exist in case of future payments by the Afghan Government. e hope that this procedure will act as a sufficient safeguard against the recurrance of a contre wennj .s sue as gave rise to the present case. 3, fith regard to paragraph 2 of ray note, the usual procedure is that when any ayment is made into a Government Treasury for credit to :be Military Department on the authority of a receivable order issued by a Controller of Military Accounts, the Treasury receipt is forwarded to the Controller concernedconcerned bo enable him to make the necessary account adjustment* In view of your remarks, it has been decided that treasury receipts for amounts deposited by the Afghan Government should be issued in duplicate and instructions are bein* issued accordingly* The original can then be transmitted by the Afghan Government through you to the Controller of Military Accounts, northern Command, Bawalpindi and the duplicate retained by them as evidence of payment. Yours sincerely, Sd/- 0. K. Caroe. .eutenant Colonel Y # K. Yraeer-Tytler, C.M,3,, M.C*, His Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Afghanistan, Kabul.I have discussed this case with Colonel X^raser-Tytier. He would be grateful if we could find out, in order to avoid a recurrence in future, why the Peshawar^ Branch of the Imperial Bank, refused tie presentation of the cheque on the let February without informing any Government authority. As it is probable that the Afghans will be making a considerable number of payments on account in respect of various items of munitions, he thinks it desirable that the Bank should be instructed to keep the Comptroller informed if for any reason some routine requirement is not complied with when instalments are paid. Had the Comptroller been informed by the Bank on the 1st February in this case, much correspondence would have been avoided as it would have been known that the Afghans had in fact presented their cheque on due date. 2. He asks for further elucidation of the final sentence of paragraph 3 of Foreign Secretary’s d.o. letter dated 2nd May 1936. It is not clear why the treasury receipt should be demanded of the Afghan Govt., who might object that they were in possession of no voucher in support of their having made payment. Sd/- 0. K.

Dear Metcalfe, Your telegram of Febru iry 8th stating that up to February 5th the first instalment on the arms had not been received from the .nfgh?#! Government came as a considerable shock to me. i had warned the Prime Minister both orally and in ariting of the date, told him that Uiere were many people who believed Afghanistan iiad neither the ability or will to pay, axid implored him to answer txiese misbelievers and lay the foundation stone of his credit with tiie British '^npire well ana truly on February 1st* Your wire reachec rue in the evening of February 9tn* ifter a sleepless night 1 wrote an urgent letter to the Prime Minister asking the reasons for this apparent default* Within a few hours an apologetic official from the Foreign office arrived to explain tnat the Afghan Government had done their best to pay on due date but the banjc and refused to take their money* They were now making anotaer attempt* 2. I wrs so relieved to hear that taere was an apparently good reason for the delay, th?t I rather unwisely took tiie responsibility for it, apologisea to the Foreign Office man and • regretted my mistake* in my telegram of February 12th. A despatch issuing this week records further mutual apologies which have passed between n^yself Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, K*C.X. j* , 0* •_&gt;* X* ,M* 'J . o., Foreign secretary to the Government of inaia in the Foreign and Political Department, hew Delia*and the Prime Minister* Meanwhile I notice the Government of India have ’lain low ana sed nufiin’. I have now received, by the mail of February 27th, 3 a letter dated 18th February, from the Deputy Controller of Military vccounts, H&amp;walpiadi, enclosing, in duplicate, buff forms I./*F. 4.507, and ^king me to ’treat as urgent* the question of recovering the instalment due from the Afghan Government whicn X understand was in fact paid in in Peshawar at any rate by tne 16th February. If as I strongly suspect these buff forms are the ’ch'dan in duplicate’ referred to in my wire of February J2th, I c miot help feeling an apology is due both to me and to the jfghan Government from somebody in India for the absurd muudle which has taken place. Don’t you agree ? 4. I presume no action is required on the Deputy Controller’s letter. For next year I would suggest that a simple order be sent to the Agent of tne Cantonment Branch of tiie Pesmwar bank, to accept the instalment wnen offered r vu issue a simple receipt Co tae p e i . The u';.. n Government and particularly the War office are not yet familiar with ’chalans in duplicate’ and these buff forms are inclinlsd to convey the impression that Afghanistan is oeing cx^eated as a department of the Government of India* If however tills suggestion, for reasons of departmental routine, is not practicable, I should be glad to receive next year S forms by January 1st 1937 at the latest*5.

But this at present appears improbable and when once His Majesty’s Government have begun to receive instalments, the arrangement? so far as I can calculate, would probably result in adjustment in favour of Government of India, in view of the provision stated in last sentence of my telegram No. 3806? because out-of-pocket expenditure there referred to will not exceed £ 10 , 250 . 2* In any case point has little importance compared v/ith desirability of early resumption of negotiations with Afghans for sale of the rifles and ammunition.

Subject to concurrence of Government of India please take following action. 2 a You should resume your negotiations for sale of these rifles at a price of £3 per rifle complete with bayonet, scabbard, oil bottle and pull-through, delivered at Karachi, plus 5s/6d per rifle for an individual inspection and firing test. His Majesty's Government note that Afghan Government state that they could only buy on deferred payments, and that they suggest six equal annual instalments. You should press strongly for a reduction of the number of instalments to three, or at most four, in view of the fact that a much smaller sum is involved in the purchase of these rifles than in that of the 5,0CC rifles from Government of India, price of which is to be paid in six annual instalments. You should also press for payment of the first instalment to be made on receipt of the rifles. Please report replies of Afghan Government on these points. 3 e por your own information. His Majesty's Government attach importance to shortening the period oi payment because, though these rifles do not constitute a very important item in their reserve, their supply involves immediate expenditure of upwards of £10,00u m reep ect of v freight/freight, inspection and test, and payment under agreement to Messrs 0 Soley, Ltd., and they hope that it will be possible to recover this expenditure from the first, or at most, the first two instalments of the purchase price. 4.

If, however, His Majesty's Government could supply the 10,000 rifles without such indemnity from you, you would be prepared to supply ammunition in annual instalments of 1,000,000 rounds (I presume up to the 6,000,000 rounds in all mentioned in paragraph 2(b) of Kabul telegram of 12th September, No.96) on the system of deferred payment described in paragraph 3 of your telegram, under which the credit allowed to Afghan Government in respect of such ammunition would be limited to Rs.93,000. 3. In these circumstances, His Majesty's Government, having regard to the importance of meeting the Afghan request for 10,000 rifles without further delay, are prepared, pending a decision on the general question and without/without prejudice thereto ? to accept provisionally (and subject to review in the light of the general settlement) the liability involved in the supply of 10 9 000 rifles to the Afghan Government against payment by instalments, without insisting on their previous request for an indemnity. The decision reached by His Majesty's Government is also subject to the following understanding, viz.., if as a result of revolution or otherwise there is a cessation of payments due from Afghan Government to Government of India and His Majesty's Government, then in the event ol partial liquidation of these debts being subsequently resumed, any debt outstanding in respect of 10,000 rifles would rank p ari pas su and pro rata with debts due to Government of India in respect of 5,000 rifles already supplied and ammunition supply of which is now contemplated. 4 , Please see Forminka No.113 dated 19th November and telegraph to Fraser-Tytler (repeating to me) if you agree that action may now be taken as proposed.P.Z.8333/35 SECR ET, CYPHER TELEGRAM from Secretary of State to Government of India 9 Foreign and Political Department, dated 19th November 1935. 69 words.

His Majesty’s Government have not dealt with question of supply of additional 15,000 rifles as this requires further consideration from the point of view of policy (apart from the question of incidence). His Majesty's Government will in due course consult you and His Majesty’s Minister further in regard to political aspect of this question with reference to Kabul telegram of 28th October, No.127, and expression of Government of India's view in first sentence of paragraph 5 of your telegram of 29th June, No.1586.Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 118, dated the 22nd (received 30th) October, 1935. In my telegram (K atodo n 80) of 5th August, 1935, I reported the arri val in Kabul of the consignment of 5,000 rifles with 3,000,000 rounds of small arms ammunition which the Afghan Government have purchased from His Majesty’s Government. During the ensuing ten days Lieut.- Colonel Lockhart, Military Attache to this Legation, was occupied in un packing the consignment, in checking rifles, bolts, etc., and in handing over complete units to the Afghan authorities for issue before the Jashan parade. Certain units which appeared defective were put aside for further inspec tion, and I have now received Colonel Lockhart’s final report on the handing over of the consignment. This report, together with the report of the Afghan board when received, will be forwarded to the Government of India with the request that such deficiencies as have been found may be made good. I need only mention here one or two points of interest connected with the transaction. 2. I have referred above to certain deficiencies in the consignment. These are on the whole very few, and Colonel Lockhart has drawn attention to the excellence of the packing, and of the general arrangements for the despatch and delivery of the consignment at Landi Kotal at very short notice and at the hottest time of the year. I would beg leave to endorse these remarks. At the parade on August 16th, I was warmly thanked by the Afghan Ministers for the efforts which had been made to deliver the consignment in time for the Jashan, and wa&amp; assured that the effect of this increase in the armament of t-he Afghan army was welcome and timely.: The credit for this belongs entirely to the military authorities in India. 3. In regard to the Afghan share in transpouting the consignment Colonel Lockhart reports that their arrangements were very good, and my past experience of such transactions makes it clear that there has been a marked improvement in this respect. It was not possible to give the authorities in Kabul very much notice, but one hundred lorries, of which fiftv were hired, arrived punctually at Landi Kotal and left within a few hours for Kabul. The convoy was well handled and controlled, and reached Kabul without mishap in the evening of the following day. 4. As regards payment for the consignment I was authorised in your telegram of 2nd August (Forminka 86) to negotiate by an exchange of letters for equal annual instalments over a period of six years to cover the total cost of Rs. 8,03,000 (Indian). These payments were to be free of interest. I now forward, as enclosures to this despatch a copy of my letter to the Foreign Minister, and a translation of his reply. It will be interesting to see whether the Afghan Government will fulfill their obligations. I have no doubt that they intend to do so, and indeed the Prime Minister has informed me that £100,000 has been set aside in the Military budget for the express purpose of paying for these and other munitions they wish to buv from His Majesty’s Government. I ventured to suggest to His High ness that while His Majesty’s Government did not doubt his will to pay, a certain scepticism as to his power to do so was perhaps not unjustified, in view of what he had told my predecessor and myself about Afghanistan’s financial position. 5. A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to the Secretary of State for India and to the Government of India.(Enclosure I to Kabul despatch No. 118, dated 22nd October, 1935.) Copy of a letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, to the Afghan Foreign Minister, No. 824, dated 6th August, 1935. With reference to the oral discussions which have taken place between His Highness/ the Prime Minister, Your Excellency and myself on the subject of the supply of munitions to the Afghan Government, I have the honour to inform you, under instructions from His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs acting in conjunction with the Gov ernment of India, that His Majesty’s Government have agreed to the pro posals made by Your Excellency’s Government in regard to the supply of 5,000 rifles and 3,000,000 rounds of ammunition. 2. The arrangements proposed were as follows :— 5,000 (five thousand) rifles complete with bayonets, oil bottles, and pull throughs and 3,000,000 (three million) rounds of small arms ammunition will be 1 delivered to the representatives of the Afghan Government at Landi Kotal on August 1st 1935. The cost of this consignment is Rs. 8,03,000 (Indian) and this sum will be credited by the Afghan Government to the account of the Government of India with the Peshawar branch of the Imperial Bank of India in six equal instalments as follows :— 1st instalment on or before February 1st, 1936 2nd instalment on or before February 1st, 1937 3rd instalment on or before February 1st, 1938 4th instalment; on or before February 1st, 1939 - 5th instalment on or before February 1st, 1940 6th instalment on or before February 1st, 1941 Rs. a.

I am writing in reply to Your Excellency’s letter, No. 824, dated the 6th August, 1935, and have the honour to state that the Government of His Imperial Majesty Muhammad Zahir Shah, King of Afghanistan, have received and accept at a cost of rupees Indian eight lacs and three thousand the 5,000 rifles complete with bayonets, oil bottles, pull throughs and thirty lacs of cartridges delivered by Your Excellency’s Government to my Govern ment, and agree to pay this sum of money in six annual instalments as stated in your letter No. 824, dated the 6th August. In accordance with your letter referred to above the first instalment having commenced before the 1st February, 1936, the sixth and last will terminate before the 1st February, 1941. Each of the six yearly instalments will amount to rupees Indian one lac thirty-three thousand eight hundred and thirty-three, annas five and pies four. My Government recognise that your Government are charging no inte rest on this sum of rupees Indian eight lacs and three thousand, being the cost of 5,000 rifles complete with bayonets, oil bottles, pull throughs and thirty lacs of cartridges, and on that account I am to convey my Govern ment’s thanks. I wish also officially to record and to express to Your Excel lency my sincere thanks as well as the thanks of my Government for this friendly' consideration shown bv the British Government. I trust you will convev these expressions of gratitude to your Government and I am certain that the friendly relations existing between the two Governments will be strengthened and increased day by day.

I believe that if the present Government remains in power and does not go bankrupt obligations will be met in fullo Ji. In refusing the request, there is the risk that the Afghan Government may fail through lack of minitions.

Proposals in your telegram No.2475 of 14th Soptember are under examination but it is inevitable that their discussion must take a considerable time. Meanwhile it appears essential to give very early reply to Afghan requests for munitions. It is especially necessary at a time when reactions of Mohmand campaign may place a strain on Afghan co-operation with us on 1 rentier matters that we di ould not now after long discussions appeal reluctant to provide Afghan Government with munitions. There is also the danger that they may turn elsewhere. They have expressed wish to accept our oiler of 10,000 rifles and only question of method of payment remains for settlement. They have already waited without a reply regarding aeroplanes for over seven months. It is desirable also to give a reply soon wo their request for 6 , 000,000 rounds of ammunition. 3. I observe however that proposals in paragraph 6 of your telegram No.2475 are conditional on His Majesty's Government undertaking liability defined in paragrajjh 5. I am afraid that this would make it impossible to give any replies to the Afghan requests for some time. 1 hope however/ \however that in circumstances set out m paragraph 2 you v/ill apree to give in respect ox 10,000 rixles indemnity settlement o:: large issues raised in your telegram 2475. default in respect of any aeroplanes and additional ammunition provided by Government of India should similarly be reserved a or decision as part ox settlement of general expenditure in Afghanistan. 4.

Ii you accept proposal in paragraph 3 please telegraph your recommendations regarding offer which has now to/3. •go be made to the Aighan Government. i am inclined to suggest rhat it might be on the lines that we are willing to supply (a) 10,000 riiles at once to be paid for in six e qua 1 annual instalment s j (b) two aeroplanes iio be delivered as soon as possible cind paid for in six equal annual instalments.

If you seel it impossible to undertake contingent liability in respect of 5 (d), we might try to postpone definite ieply to Afghan Government on this point until general cpnestion is settled. It seems however essential to dispose at once of question of 10,000 rifles and open negotiations regarding aeroplanes. If you find it convenient you will no doubt telegraph separately in advance regarding 5 (a) and reserve other heads for further examination.SECRET ' $ 2 :“ PV 0F IT/AW {163 groups) 4912 DECYFHSR OF TEL3G RAM, From Government of india p Foreign (COPIES circulated) and Political Department p to Secretary of State for India Dated Simla# 14th September, 1935* Received 14th September, 5 935, 9 C 30 p*in c IS.° JU rat of several p art s 6 Addressed to Secretary of State and repeated to Kabul, 295 c Your telegram of July 13th s 2190, and our telegram of July 16th s 1726* We have carefully reviewed our position in the matter of peace-time expenditure in Afghanistan in the light of our existing and prospective financial position and of our responsibility to coming Federal Government c Tdia expenditure falls under two heads;- ^a) ordinary, namely., cost a of maintenance of Legation and Consulates (approximately 4*45 lakhs per annum) and (b), extraordinary, being c^et cf material assistance rendered irera time to time in order to maintain friendship and stability o,t Afghanistan* The former head is not in question* as regards latter, our present attitude is defined by Government of India’s telegram, 1323-S of October 22nd s 1925, as being to grant to Amir material assistance in kind, provided that he asks lor it,, has earned it, and it is to mutual advantage of India and Afghanistan* Since establishment of Legation in our average annual expenditure under this head has come to little over 4 lakhs.

Moreover ammunition deteriorates, and it would therefore not be in interest of Afghanistan to purchase large quantities at any one tlge.

SECRET. Cypher Telegram addressed hy Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to H.M.Minister, Kabul, No. 75, repeated to Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, dated 23rd August, 1935. (422 words) XXX Katodon, No. 77 of 31st July. 2. Statement in Small Arms Book referred to in Government of India’s telegram of 29th July No. 1896 is misleading. 1914 pattern rifle was originally designed to take a cartridge with a bullet of .276 calibre. When however it was decided to substitute the .303 cartridge it became necessary to put a lining into the magazine in order that it might take the smaller cartridges. The only result of the alteration is that if the bolt is used in a slovenly manner a round occasionally sticks. 3« Please inform the Afghan Government in this sense. You may also say as regards guarantee of reliability that War Office regard these rifles as so satisfactory that they were considering a short time ago substituting them for the Short Lee Enfield Rifles now used in the Regular Army. Proposal was however turned down for other reasons. It may therefore be said that H.M.G. consider rifles to be reliable. As an additional safeguard the War Office recommends that each rifle should be given an individual inspection and also a firing test for accuracy of sighting. The additional cost of these tests would be 5s/6d. for each rifle, bayonet and scabbard of which 2s/6d. would be due for the firing test. In this connection statement of Afghan Prime Minister in Katodon No. 77 para. 3 about similar pattern rifles presumably refers to sale of some thousands of 1914 pattern rifles through/fi (|0M through Fleming vi&amp; Pflris in 192b• These were toKen xrom the same stool as now ofierea hut they were not specially selected nor individually inspected before sale. 4. War Office are not prepared to give any particular or written guarantee with this type of rifle beyond emphasising its merits and suggesting additional safeguard of inspection. If by written guarantee War Minister means that if any of the rifles be found unsatisfactory by the Afghans amount paid for them would be refunded to Afghan Government, H.M.G. could not give such a guarantee even in respect of new rifles in view of impossibility of their being sure that after delivery to the Afghans they would be looked after as carefully as by British units. 5. Please telegraph your viev/s on Government of India’s suggestion that some sample rifles might be sent for trial by the Afghans. War Office do not think it necessary to send sample rifles especially in view of the explanation and inspection offered in paragraphs 2 and 3. On the other hand they can despatch samples on payment oy the Afghans ii it is thought that such a course would avoid any possibility of misunderstanding or recrimination. 6. It is clear that Afghans will not take old ammunition and for new stock the best source of supply would be India.FCN/CWP/LJC/DIA.

From the text book, Small Arms, 1929, pages ? and 6, it appears that the 19X4 pattern rifles are not entirely suitable for general use in the field and that the magazines are aieo not wholly satisfactory, it seems moat desirable that the Afghans, who are connoisseurs In email arms, should be irankly informed of these defects* especially as British munitions hitherto supplied to them have always been satisfactory. It is suggested that some sample rifles might be sent,prelerably by air,for trial by Afghans before they deorvde to purchase. Samples ahoul d, of course, include some in rifles exhibiting the magazine defects mentioned/the text-* books, unless it can be guaranteed that no rifles with these defects would be supplied* Understood that Brno firm (Czeoho Slovakia) are sending two oi their old rifles to Afghanistan by air*” *5005/35 SECRET . XXX CYPHER TELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY OF STATE TO HIS MAJESTY'S MINISTER, KASUL, 26th JULY, 1935. FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS DATED 563 words. 63. Please see para, 4 of telegram from Secretary of State for India to Government of India, Ho.2190, dated 13th July. Supply of rifles to Afghan Government. In this connection please see also para, 2 of Foiminka 57 of 5th July, 1934, para, 2 of Porminka 70 of 4th September and para. 3 of Katodon 101 of 26th September, 1934. 2. War Office have large stocks of unused 1914 pattern rifles which they could supply at price of £3 per rifle complete with bayonet, scabbard, oil bottle and pull-through, delivered at Karachi. War Office also have stcoks of .303 ammunition made during the War which they could supply at a price of £1.4.0 per 600 rounds delivered at Karachi. 3. Farther particulars of the rifles and ammunition are as follows: Rifles. Magazine .303 n . PA914 B.K.A. Mk.I . The rifles can be reckoned as unused weapons, having been made for the British Army during the war and only issued in small numbers to Home Defence Units. Host of the rifles have only fired the number of rounds necessary for inspection while the remainder can be taken as not having fired more than two or three hundred rounds. Rifles of this pattern were this year allowed to be used in the National Rifle Association competitions at Bisley and achieved much success. The2 K The 1914 Pattern rifle is also, with the addition of the necessary fittings to tale a telescopic sight, the sniper rifle of the British Army. Ammunition. Cartridges , Small Arm, Ball 0 503 n , M k.VII. While, in view of the age of this ammunition, no guarantee can 'be given, recent reports show that the ammunition continues to hehave in a reasonably regular manner. 4. Prom the Afghan point of view, supply of 10,000 of these units (rifle plus 600 rounds of ammunition) at a price of £4.4.0. per unit plus cost of transport from Karachi to Afghanistan would appear to he a much more attractive proposition than purchase of current pattern rifles from Indian stocks at a price approximating to cost quoted in para.6 (b) of Government of India’s telegram of 29th June, No.1586, which works out at nearly £11 per unit. Price quoted above is for cash on delivery, but, even so, offer might oe attractive to Afghan Government. If they cannot pay cash for 10,000 at once they might wish to purchase what they can afford now and the remainder at subsequent dates. I may add for your infoimation that we understand that Afghan Government is already in negotiation through a French intermediary for purchase of such rifles from Messrs. Soley, and it seems highly probable that purchasing through such a channel they would have to pay a considerably higher cash price. If they can afford this they are perhaps the more likely to be attracted by our own offer also, 5. You should at once, in whatever manner you deem best, make offer to Afghan Government to sell 10,000 or any smaller number of these rifles on teims mentioned and ascertain whether they are attracted by the proposal, and are able to pay cashon delivery for 10,000 at once or for smaller numbers gradually delivered over a period of time. 6. If however Afghan Government, while willing to take these rifles, profess to he unable to make any purchase except on deferred payment, it is desirable to obtain information of their proposals. In this event, therefore, you should discreetly ascertain what is the best basis of payment by instalments that they can offer, but you should not at this stage commit His Majesty’s Government to accepting payment by instalments as this question is still under consideration (see telegram Ho.2364 dated 27th July, to Government of India).P.z. 5005/35. SECRET. CYPHER TELEGRAM ADDRESSED BY SECRETARY OP STATE TO GOVERNMENT OP INDIA, No.2364, AND REPEATED TO HIS MAJESTY’S MINISTER, KABUL, No.64, DATED 27th JULY 1935. XXX (No.of words: 310) 2364. Porminka 63. Supply of rifles to Afghan Government. 2. If offer which His Majesty's Minister has been instructed to make is accepted by Afghan Government, this will afford by far the least costly means of satisfying our political desideratum, viz: to meet their request for assistance in the interests of their internal security. Prom Indian point of view, this alternative seems also to have the advantage of avoiding any risk of a further depletion of India’s war reserves. 3. If Afghan Government having regard to low price offered, are able to pay cash for consignments as delivered, no difficulty will arise. 4. If, however, they press for payment by instalments, it seems probable that, having regard to the disparity in price, they may be able to offer a much more favourable basis of deferred payments than the six-year basis offered to the Government of India. Any basis of deferred payment, however, would involve a liability on His Majesty’s Government which (in view especially of the fact that an unpaid claim on the Afghan Government would have to appear in the appropriation account) they are reluctant to undertake pending a decision on general question of incidence of charges for measures calculated to assist Afghan Government.We trust therefore that in event of deferred payments being proposed and agreed to, Government of India would be willing (pending a decision on this general question and without prejudice to the uecision) to agree to indemnify His Majestyfe Government in respect of any loss incurred through delivery of rifles in advance of payment and eventual default of payment at due date. You will observe that this contingent liability would be very much smaller than that incurred by sale of 10,000 of the more expensive rifles from your war reserves on deferred payments spread over six years. 5. I would be glad if you could let me have a reply on point raised in paragraph 4 above when once Fraser-Tytler has ascertained from Afghan Government whether they are attracted by our offer, whether or to what extent they can pay cash, and what is the best basis of deferred payment that they could accept. When this information is available it will be possible to calculate more accurately the extent of the contingent liability (if any) involved.187 • V5 Telegram XX No. 187 Dated 16th July 1935 Drorn. . .Foreign* Simla.

Reasons given in our telegram of 29th June for insistence on both arms and financial guarantee were real. On consideration of their position in light of new financial burden imposed on them by Quetta, Government of India felt very strongly on point of incidence of cost and on their side agreement to defer decision on this point was due to desire to contribute to solution of immediate problem confronting both Governments. We are consulting Fraser-Tytler regarding 1914 rifles suggestion but I doubt if Afghans would regard it with favour if as is believed here they are being offered new ones cheap by Japanese.

The Foreign Office had no objection. The main differences from the original draft are (a) omission of paras. 4, 5 and 6 which suggested that the later instalments of 10,000 rifles might be supplied from 1914 stocks in this country. The War Office wish to consider this further, and propose a conference of Departments, including the Treasury, next Thursday. (b) modification of the last paragraph. This modified formula gives a firm undertaking to make good, in an emergency, the deficiency of the 5,000 units to be supplied at once from India (this is so much to the good), but they wished to add that in such a case India would have to pay unless a decision favourable to her were taken on the general question of financial liability for such charges arising out of relations with Afghanistan. On/On this point the wording of the War Office draft was improved as a result of telephone conversation between Sir L. V/akely and the Deputy Under Secretary of State at the War Office, and the telegrams in the form below were sent, consequential modifications being made in the private telegram. &lt;]UJ~MZrx 'T.Teleeram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 13th July 1935* 2191. Private and personal. Please see my official telegram dated 13th July, 2190, regarding sale of arms to Afghan Government. It is generally agreed that great importance to India of stability of Afghan regime makes it desirable to supply reasonable quantity of arms for improvement of efficiency of Afghan Army and in particular to provide an instalment in time to enable them to make an impressive show at Jashan celebrations next month. Question of method and source of supply of later instalments is being taken up here, but I sincerely trust that your Government will agree to supply at once the 5&gt;000 rifles which are immediately required and will be satisfied with measure of assurance regarding replacement in an emergency which is contained in our official telegram. It has proved impracticable, though we have done our best, to obtain from departments of His Aajesty's Government concerned compliance with request that His Aajesty 1 s Government would guarantee replacement “at their own charge”, pending consideration of t e general policy in regard to incidence of charges in respect of Afghanistan. I think you will agree that a last- moment condition of this kind should not be allowed to stand in the way of action which is politically desirable and has been under such long consideration.CYPHER TELEGRAM PROM SECRETARY OP STATE TO GOVERIMHNT OP INDIA, DATED 13th July, 1935.

Government of India’s difficulties are appreciated but you will realise that little time has been left for consideration of matter here by delay in reply to our telegram of 12th April, No.1195, which asked for information at once on certain preliminary questions. Object of these was to enable us to consider whether it would be desirable and preferable to supply from this country rather than from India (compare paragraph 4 of Porminka 57 of 5th July 1934 and Porminka 70 of 4th September). War Office are now (in consultation with India Office, Treasury pnd Foreign Office) taking up question whether as regards later installments Afghan requirements could (if desired) be met by the alternative of cheap supply of 1914 rifles from here, and I hope that it will be possible to communicate agreed suggestions to Government of India and Minister at Kabul at a. very early date. But as supply of first instalment of 5,000 in time for Jashan is now most urgent and can only be made from India, we trust that this small number will be supplied without insistence on literal compliance with condition now stated for first time. No reference was made to any such condition in Government of India’s telegram of 8th April when they stated that they were prepared to supply a certain number of rifles either free mmof cost or on long term deferred payments. Request that H.M.G. will guarantee replacement in an emergency 'at their own charge” now raises a most difficult question of general policy. It has not been possible to obtain and hardly seems reasonable to expect a definite guarantee in this form at such short notice and as a condition to action which is now immediately required.■■■ ; T—- J ——r- ***** -J^w SECRET • '7 a v ^ ^ / / (• iQ- r; A‘ CWP/AV, (63 groups) 3732. jhrJ y Jl. u DgQYPHBR 0 V TBIBQRAM.

DRAFT TE J^EURAhi to Government of India. Previous Papers :—Minute Paper. political and secret Department. An Afghan request for the supply of munitions on sale was before the Cabinet in the spring of 1934 together with other questions of policy towards Afghanistan. The Cabinet decisions in effect accepted the principle of selling arms to the Afghan Government and British Minister was directed to ascertain the Afghan requirements and the basis of payment proposed. The Afghan Government did not particularise their request till January last when they asked, among other things, for 30,000 rifles to be paid for by instalments spread over six years. They asked that they should be supplied in time for the 'Independence** celebrations held at Kabul in August in order to impress the representatives from all parts of Afghanistan attending these celebrations. The importance to Indian interests of the stability of the present friendly Afghan Government is well known. One means of promoting this stability is to supply reasonable quantities of arms for internal security. Sir R. Maconachie did not consider that the figure of 30,000 was to be taken too seriously and we may agree with the G. of I. that an initial offer of 15,000 in three instalments spread over six months is reasonable. In the correspondence of last year some consideration was given to the question whether when the Afghan requirements were specified they could more conveniently be met from stocks in India or in this country (telegrams to Kabul and the G. of I./ 2621 6000 3/34 I- 2 - (i. of I. of 5th July 1934 and 4th September 1934)• For a decision on this question it was necessary to know to what extent the Government of India could supply the Afghan requirements and at what price. On the Minister’s recommendation no action was taken on the Afghan request of January pending consultation between him and the G. of I. and his arrival home in this country. In a telegram of 8th April 1935 the G. of I. stated that they were prepared to supply a certain number of Indian rifles either free of cost or on long term deferred payments. It is desirable for various % reasons, however, that the rifles should be sold c rather than given free of cost, and in a telegram of 12th April we asked the G. of I. for detailed information regarding the number which they could supply and the price, etc. The G. of I., in spite of reminders, have not been able to reply till this telegram of 29th June. The supply of a first instalment for the Independence celebrations is now urgent and can obviously only be made from India. Unfortunately, paragraph 7 of the G. of I.’s telegram requests as a condition of their supplying rifles that H.M.G. will t give a definite guarantee to replace any resulting deficiency at their own charge if this is necessary owing to an emergency arising in India. The question of the reply to be sent to the G. of I.’s telegram was considered at a meeting on the 11th July with representatives of the General Staff and the War Office Finance Department and Contracts Department, and the attached draft telegram was prepared This is subject to the concurrence of the higher authorities/Minute Paper. - 3 - Department. authorities in the War Office and of coarse also of the Foreign Office. In order to save time, it is submitted for approval subject to such concurrence. As regards the condition stated by the G. of Ithe guarantee requested cannot be given in the terms suggested. There might be relatively little difficulty about promising to replace a small deficiency in the improbable event of an emergency but the difficulty lies in giving a guarantee in advance that this would be done at the charge of H. M.G. It does not seem at all reasonable for the G. of I. to ask for a definite guarantee of this kind against purely hypothetical circumstances before agreeing to action which is now urgently required. They had previously expressed their willingness to supply rifles without making a reference to any such stipulation. In view of the importance and urgency of the matter, perhaps the official telegram might be reinforced by a p. and p. telegram to the Viceroy on the lines of the draft which is put up. I would also propose to send a d.o. telegram to Mr. Acheson in reply to his of the 10th July. The general question of financial responsibility for policy towards Afghanistan which is referred to in paragraph 3 of the G. of I^s telegram of 29th June is of course a matter for subsequent consideration. The question of the economic situation in Afghanistan is already being j dealt with separately. The first step is to send a i qualified expert to examine it, and it may be remarked that the G. of I.'s criticism in regard to this/ 2956 6000 7/34- 4 - this is not very reasonable, as they themselves have made no useful response to our repeated requests for advice from them on the subject; moreover the fact to which the G. of I. refer that recent reports t about the Afghan financial situation are conflicting makes it the more evident that the first step to be taken should be to obtain authoritative information c • on the subject. yi+JtUGy, /7 , }.

Supply of rifles to Afghan Government. 2. H.M.G. consider it politically most desirable to meet Afghan request so far as possible. We agree that 15,000 rifles with 600 rounds of ammunition per rifle is a reasonable limit for initial offer. 3. H.M.G. consider that in accordance with Afghan Government’s original request and more especially in view of Kabul telegram No. 71, it is most important that 5,000 complete units should be delivered in time for Jashan. In view of time margin this supply at any rate must come from India’s stocks and we trust that arrangements to ensure timely delivery will be put in hand at once as suggested in paragraph 5 of Kabul telegram No. 71. Price for these 5,000 should then be negotiated (as proposed in paragraph 6(b) of your telegram) between Fraser Tytler and Afghan Ministers in the light icqueotcd in pnrngrnph''tolc^rcm ijo» 71 andT f -aloo in the of following alternative arrangements which H.M.G. are able to propose for the supply of the remaining 10,000 units. 4. War Office have large stocks of unused 1914 pattern rifles which they could supply at a price of about £3 per unit delivered in India. War Office also have stocks of .303 ammunition made during the War which they could supply at a price of about £2.5.0 per thousand rounds exclusive of carriage. 5. Supply of 10,000 or some even larger number (if this were decided on) of these rifles would appear to be a far better proposition from the Afghan point of view than purchase from Indian stocks at a price approximating to cost quoted in paragraph 6(b) of your telegram (which works out at nearly £11 per unit inclusive of only 600 rounds per rifle). A further advantage of suggested alternative is that it would avoid any risk of a dangerous depletion of India's war reserve?, /n*. 6. If Government of India agree in principle, Fraser Tytler might ascertain whether this alternative would be attractive to Afghan Government. If so, details of price and conditions of sale would be further considered by H.M.G. and communicated at the earliest possible date.7. In view of the fact that if the alternative referred to above were adopted the depletion of India's reserves would be limited to 5,000 units only, trust that you will waive the condition stated in paragraph 7 of your telegram in respect of the initial supply of 5,000 units which is imnediately ne cessary*^ In the event of an emergency arising in India, there can be little doubt that H.M.G# would be able to replace a deficiency of 5,000 units but without prejudice to the question of the incidence of the charge which would have to be decided when the contingency arose.Draft Paper POLITICAL AMD SECRET Department.

I expect that by this time you will have had a reply to your telegram No. 1195 of the 12th April to the Government of India. If so perhaps we could go ahead at once on the question of the supply of rifles to the Afghan Government. The details of this matter are, as you say, somewhat complicated, but it strikes me as being the item of Mohammed Hashum’s requirements which we can most easily satisfy. I venture to suggest, however, that it is even more important - in view of the parlous state of Afghan finances - to determine what reply is to be given to his request for:- (a) Short term credits to enable Afghanistan to purchase British manufactures; and (b) Other trade facilities, such as free transit of goods through India and the like. There is also of course the important question of the purchase oi aeroplanes. J.C. Walton, Esq., C.B.,M.C., India Office.

Bequest of the Afghan Government for aeroplanes and .303 rifles. Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. Please see Katodon No.10 of 24th January, jp.Z. 559/35^J reporting the request of the Prime Minister for the sale of munitions made in the course of an interview on the 22nd January. We have now received the record of a further discussion with the Afghan Ministers on 21st February^which went into the subject in greater detail. The Afghans want 24 aeroplanes for reconnaissance, light bombing and carrying small parties of officers, and the 28 pilots already in the Afghan Air Force to be sent to India for training in flying the new aeroplanes. short .303 rifles are also desired, the idea with which Shah Mahmud was playing for arming the Afghan troops stationed south of the Hindu Kush with rifles of some other bore having been abandoned. The/ L. nHt The Afghan Government would like delivery by August 1935 in order that the new weapons may impress the tribes during the Independence Celebrations. They offer payment in instalments spread over 6 years. The Afghan Ministers gave as their reasons for desiring to have these munitions, not only the preservation of internal peace (and they anparently contemplate that the stronger their army the greater progress they will be able to make in disarming their tribesmen), but also for possible defence against Persia. This is of particular interest. Relations between Persia and Afghanistan have recently been marred by U.oco£oe.r tension on their joint frontier. This would^seem susceptible W settlement. One raid at Zurabad was recently disposed of by a Joint Commission, although the Persians issued a garbled version of the agreement reached by the Commission, and the award of the Turkish Government regarding the alignment of the undemarcated portion of the frontier is nov/ being awaited. Another disturbing factor in the relations between the two countries is the assumption by Persia of the name of Iran^ which the Afghans read as meaning that the Persians have vague designs on Afghan territory. But although the Persians have got a great deal of 'wind in the head', to use Mahmud Hashim's phrase, it would seem unlikely that they would make an unprovoked attack on Afghanistan, The question of the supply of these munitions is fairly urgent if the Afghans are going to have them by August. We can, however, make no progress in the matter until we receive the views of the Government of India ? which they are no doubt now 1ormulating as a result of their discussions with Sir R. Maconachie and Colonel Fraser-Tytler. Lr v.- A- * ^ ^ -W 12^ C* ^va vtrtv/—&lt; ^ ‘‘-^-^/-t ^fl:y ®- ^ . V-4 - ? r' The supply of Afghan requirements in munitions was really approved in principle by the Cabinet on 14th March, 1934. It is desirable to supply a sufficiency of suitable types of weapon to meet their genuine requirements for internal security, apart from the possibilities of external aggression by Russia or Persia (both of which we may hope are remote). We have been waiting a long time to hear from the Afghan Govt, what their requirements are, and we now at last have the definite requests made by the Afghan Ministers in their interview with Sir R. Maconachie on 21st February. Presumably the G. of I. discussed the matter with him while he was at Delhi, but we have as yet heard nothing from them on the subject, except that in the third part of their telegram of 8th April attached tl^ey state that they are willing to supply a certain number of Indian rifles, either free of cost or on long-term deferred payments. If the G. of I. cannot supply all thes Afghan requirements, or so much as we consider reasonable, r\ there is always the possibility of supplying rifles cheaply from army store in this country. The Afghan requests for aeroplanes and for the training of pilots in India are most interesting, ^rom one point of view it might suit us better to supply aeroplanes (on payment) than rifles. The suggestion that as a first step a R.A.F. officer should go to Kabul to advise the Afghan War MinisterMinute Paper. Department. seems a good one. It is desirable that the Afghan Govt., if they buy aeroplanes, should buy types really suitable to their requirements. This question and that of the training of the pilots are evidently closely connected. If no objection in principle is seen to selling military aircraft of the right type and to training pilots, so as to reduce the chance that the new aeroplanes will merely 'rot on the ground”, then it migfrt be desirable to send a R.A.F. officer to Kabul to discuss the proposals with the Afghan Govt, in detail as soon as possible.

In order to stir A Jiv-V' them up we propone to- send a telegram on- It may be a question whether for the look of the thing it might not be better that the Afghans should pay some (perhaps nominal) price for the rifles rather than receive them as a free gift. My idea is that we might ascertain how many rifles the G. of I. are willing to supply, and on what terms. Then we might compare the terms on which the G. of I. are willing to supply them with the terms, plus cost of freight, at which they could be supplied from army store in this country, ibid if the G. of I. ’s terms work out cheaper but they are unable or unwilling to supply the whole of the 30,000, or as many as it is thought right to/to let the Afghans have (you will notice that Maconachie thinks the figure of 30,000 a maximum which they hardly expect • • to obtain), it can also be considered whether we should supply the balance from country.

Jfaconachie. His fajesty's minister, Kabul.1. Airerc^'U (i) The minister of $ar seated that his Tov^rn^nt ^isheu to purchase from His ajesty's Govermaent 24 aircraft* He haa studiea the details of specifications and per 1 orraance of various types of British aircraf t supplied to him by the oyal \±r Force, India, through His Majesty's Legation, mo. had come to the conclusion that \»hat he needed 20 -tawker Harts or Fairey Foxes. 4 H.K. Dragons* (He made no mention of the advice given to the Afghan air force officers by the doyal Air iorce ttirough the iiitary Attache to the effect that other stack in es than these were better suited to Afghan requirements)* (ii) I said that although I knew nothing about the subject the Military Attache and 1 nad discussed it with the i oyal Air Force Xnaia, anu as a result of these 0 -iscussions would suggest that the Afghan to\ jrnsient shoulu not be cai 4 ried away by the idea of possessing high performance machines built for special purposes, which were difficult to fly and unsuitea to their own oa ticular requirements* ;»ould it ndt be better v0 see first what these requirements really were, and then go for the simplest and cheapest type of machine which would meet them.? (iii) The Prime Minister and minister for Foreign Aflairs entirely agreed that this was the right method of approaching the question* vThe 'linister for Var then stated that he required machines for reconnaissance, light oombing, and carrying small parties of officers - (hence the Dragons) - with a ceiling of 18,000 1 so as to cross the Hindu Kush, and a range of 500 miles continuous flight so as to reach Herat from Kabul in one hop# : e asis.ec ior prices of various accessories, armament etc* most of which had in fact already been communicated to the Afghan air force. (iv) He stated that the Afghan air force had 28 pilot*, but these had received no uniform training, having learnt to fly in different countries France, Italy, ussia etc. He wished to send them to India, or other suitable locality, for training on the machines which the ,fghan Government might decide to buy from us. (v) I suggested that before any Decision on the point was reached it might oe aesiraole for a Royal Air rorce expert to come to Kabul and advise the Minister of ar. this was agreed to, and it was proposed that this officer should be asKed to come to ^abul before I left, out I saia tnat tikis was impracticaole. 2. ~&gt;mall arms. (i) 'Sinister of .ar confirmed that 30,000 short .303 rifles in i irst class condition were required. In ! answer to my enquiry, he said that one idea oi rearmament with rilles of a different ooi*q naa b©en abandoned, as the disadvantages involved (via. danger oi confusion iny* annuziltdoxi supply in time of war) outv»eijh#d adv^tagas (viz, prevention of leakage of ammunition in tiiae of peace)# (ii) lie also asked for a sample of the Vickers Berthier light automatic gun which the Afghan officers had seen during their recent visit to the Delhi manoeuvres. 3. ..jenei j al• (i) Asked as regards their proposal for payment the inioters suggesteu instalments spreaa over six years. (ii) they expressed a desire that the pilots ahoulu be trained, and the aircraft and rifles delivered in time to impress the populace at the Independence celebrations of August 193b• (iii) I ointea out that I would probably have to give the authorities considering these proposals answers to certain questions, which I would now put to the ministers. (a) i*or what purpose were these additional ! ireraft and rifles required,* I had seen in a recent publication that the present strength of the Afgtutt regular army was ?0,000, ana I suggested that tiiis seemed unnecessarily large for internal security purposes and of little practical use xor external defence, since the real military strength of is tan, as history had shown, lay in its irregular, not in its regular forces. King Kadir jhaa had told me that, as soon as roads had beenconstructed to give the necessary mobility, the army woulc. ue kept at a permanent strength of some 35,000* The present size of the army seemed to involve a severe drain on the economic resources of the country* II the army were reduced it seemaa possible that the money thus set free coul. oe employed in economic development, in regard to v*hich the ‘finisters had already asked for assistance* he Prim Minister said that the present anay was much smaller than that of riabibullah’s time, Ahen they also haa a guarantee of British px*otcction* The roads were not really roads at all, and at times, (such as now between Kabul and Kandahar) were completely impassable* -he army was x*equired at its present strength to overawe the tribes, and .maintain internal peace. It hau 4.1so to watch an enormous extent of frontier, and the Russian border was now held in a strength of only seven men to every six miles* The duties of these detachments were to stop sjuuggling and petty raids, and even these duties were beyond them. It was of course absurd to suppose that tne Afghan ariay could effectively oppose an invasion from Russia. This would have been irapossiole even when he himself was in 'oscow and the military strength of the soviet Union had he understood increased ten times since then. ho question of hostilities5* with India of course arose, Out for arguments sake it could be statea that an Afghan array of 300,000 woulo be unable if only through lack of equipment, artillery, aircraft etc* to meet the Indian Anay in the field. The minister of war pointed out that although a large standing army was expensive, its reauction below the saf ety line, as Aiitanuilah had proved, was really more expensive, since it led to disturbances, such as the Khost rebellion of 1924, which leaving out of account the loss of life, had cost Afghanistan millions of rupees. The minister for loreign Affairs said that there was another possibility which if not imminent was real and important. Persia was becoming comparatively wealthy, and developing a powerful army. Pahrettin Pasha during nis recent visit to Kabul had said that these developments were a real menace to Turkey, out even more so to xifghsnistan. .Afghanistan, Falsa uhanaaad *.«at on, sincerely desired peace *iUi Persia, and nad no idea whatever of aggression in that direction any more than in any other. But Persia’s attituce was not at all satisfactory. He quoted the Persian communiques in i»egard to the Zurab&amp;d affair, and said that although it had been agreed between the Persian and Afghan governments that the status0, quo should de ..laintalnod in the msadad sector ponding the announcement of the itirkish Commissi oil’s award, the u:iir-i-laBhkar«-i-sharq (tiie Pex*sian military commander in hhoraosan) had recently visited the frontier with troops, expelled tribesmen, and given orders for the construction of an aerodrome at Persian Karez, 3 (sic) miles * est of Xolam kila* uhtuamaa thun look a copy of tue n Iran** out of uis pocket, and saia that tha official explanation or the change of name fi*03i 11 Persia” to “Iran”, althou^a ridiculous, was at the sam time important, particularly the second x*eason given in an article in the M Iran' which he read out, referring to the old Iranian empire* This empire, he said, had included Afghanistan, Bokhara, Baluchistan etc* and it would he a mistake to disregard froth of this kind as altogether ridiculous* It was that, but it was also vary significant* The aircraft and the rifles were therefore required (a) to maintain internal peace by impressing x,ne trioes (particularly at the Inuepenuence celebrations wnich were attended by people from all parts of Afghanistan) and (b) for possiole defence against Persia*7. (b) I said there was another difficulty U&gt; which I had referreu at my interview of the £ nd January. This was that if trie present fghan 'Government fell their armament would, as in 1929, come into the hands of the tribes on the frontier of India and so greatly increase our problem of maintaining peace in that area* The Minister* said that so long a* Great Britain and .^f'^ianiston stood together the fghan Government could not fall. I pointed out that any such relation* uiu nut ouviate the danger of assassination and that the sudden removal of the three Ministers present might mean the collapse of their Government. They replied that this would be an act of God, and that risks were *• Iways i’;Vjived i . any course of action. The Prime Minister pointed out that if the Afghan JJovomaent were weak, rifles might quite possibly be distributed among their tribes by Joviet agents in far larger quantities than those held oy the fgnan Government, so that any weakness of the Afghan government through lack of arms also involved a real danger of an increase of armaments in tile tribal belt. (c) I ashed what the attitude of the Afghan GoverxuftSSt was in regard to the present armament of the frontier tribes, hhich seeaasd to me to oa a menace to the peace of ooth India and . fghauisten.The Tlinistar of Foreign affair® said that with a strong regular army they would be able to (proceed with disarmament which they already had in view. Provided the Afghan tribes were auffici ntly impi'esaed by the military strength of the Central ,‘ovemnent 3uch disarmameiit could be effected without any fi^^hting. The rixioc. now required would help to achieve this object. The minister of Tar said that they had in fact already recovered some :-5j000 rifles. The Prime Minister remarked that these were all useless ana in disrepair. If they were shown to Colonel Lockhart the latter would, certainly say f melt th«m all down* $ but it was quite true that, even if the jfghan Government had hitherto been unsuccessful in diearming their tribes, they could expect success in this direction if they improved the armament of their regular army as now proposed.

It is not known whether this S.A.A. v/as to have been of .303 calibre. As far as it known at the War Office, the Japanese are not manufacturing .303 ammunition, on the contrary their arsenals and factories are reported to be fully occupied producing weapons and ammunition for their own armed forces which are not equipped with the .303 rifle. It is conceivable, however, that the Japanese might manufacture .303 ammunition if, for political reasons, it was desirable and possible to find a market for it.

Hitherto it has been impossible to get anything definite out of the Afghan Govt, as to their requirements; apparently last year they had the whole question of the method of arming their forces and the sources of supply under re-examination. It will be remembered that Sir R.

Although the G. of I. would have preferred/&gt;«&gt; 7- : W' preferred a request for artillery and machineguns instead of rifles, the present communication from the Afghan Prime hinister is a satisfactory outcome of the conversations which have taken dace. We have, however, still to learn precisely what terms of payment the Afghan Govt, propose. It will also be necessary to decide whether the rifles should be supplied from surplus stocks in India or in this country, and in the latter case, whether the Afghan Govt, should deal direct with H.M«G. or with B.S.A.

If any loss is involved in selling them on terras acceptable to the Afghans and by easy instalments, the question whether this should be borne by the G. of I. or H.k.G. may also arise.

CABINE T. AFGHANISTAN. Memorandum by the Secretar y of State for India. In connection with the conclusions reached on 14th March 1934, in regard to Afghanistan (Cabinet 9 (34)) ? I circulate for the information of my colleagues the following brief summary of recent developments, bearing on the policy of the Afghan Government towards this country and towards Russia, in case it may be of interest. 2. It will be remembered that the Afghan Government had made a reeuest for consultation with the British General Staff in connection with the defence of the new road from Kabul to northern Afghanistan. His Majesty's Minister was instructed to have a friendly talk with the Afghan Prime Minister, in order to ascertain whether this request appeared to indicate dissatisfaction with our previous declarations of policy and to designed to draw us into a specifid military commitment. On 21st April Sir R 0 Maconachie had a most satisfactory interview with Muhammad Hashim. This interview made it clear that in suggesting military consultation the Afghan Government had in mind only the defence of the Northern road with their own resources! that they are satisfied with our past assurances, * and that there is no danger of their adopting a pro-Russian policy or entering into any unwise commitment to Russia. Muhammad Hashim stated that his policy, which would be adhered to so long as he was alive, is the same as that of the late King; Nadir, namely, sincere friendship and co-operation with His Majesty's Government, although the fact should never be advertised, and might sometimes have to be camouflaged.2. 3. From statements made by the Afghan Foreign Minister and Prime Minister at later interviews on Fth and 6th September 9 it appears that for some time past the Soviet legation has given up its hectoring attitude. It no longer presses unacceptable demands and proposals, ihe suggestion that the northern road might be joined up with the Russian railway system fout of which the Afghan request for consultation with our General Staff arose) has not been repeated., and the Afghan a inister has stated that it may now be regarded as having been abandoned. 4. On 21st April Sir R. Maconachie made the offer of military consultation on the defence of the northern road. But 3 as a result, no doubt, partly of the change in the Soviet attitude, the Afghan Government appear to be in no hurry for this to take place. A suggestion was made that British advisers mieht visit the road when a new alignment, now under construction, has been completed. Subseouently a programme was tentatively agreed upon by the Government of India and Sir R. Maconachie for such a visit and for subse uent technical discussions in India between the Indian General Staff and Afghan officers deputed for the purpose. The Afghan Government, however, have not reverted to the matter. The position therefore is that we have offered to comply with their reouest for military consultation regarding the defence of the road, and in doing so have reassured them of the friendly and sympathetic attitude of His Majesty's Government, while the Afghan Government, on their side, are satisfied with our assurances. In these circumstances, the Government of India and Sir R. Maconachie agreed that it would be a mistake to do more than we have done to press our offer on tho Afghan Govern- rnent, and it was decided, on their recommendation, to leave the mattermatter in abeyance until the Afghan Government bring it forward again. I should ? however ? add that Colonel Grasett ^who has just relinquished the appointment of Deputy Director of Intelligence on the Indian General Staff was enabled to visit the northern road during a recent stay at the Kabul Legation. He has written a most interesting and valuable report on this and also on the roads from India to Kabul and Kandahar. 5. The important question of the improvement of the roads into Afghanistan from the Indian frontier has been taken up in the course of the conversations which have already taken place. At the interview on 21st April, Sir R. Maconachie reminded the Afghan Prime Minister of the assurances previously given to the Afghan Government, and pointed out to him that military assistance could not, even if other conditions were favourable, be given on an adequate scale or with the speed which might be desirable, unless the road between Torkham and Kabul were improved. Muhammad Hashim replied that the road was being improved as rapidly as the Afghan Government could afford, and enquired whether His Majesty’s Government were prepared to grant financial assistance; at the same time he made it clear that such assistance, however welcome it would be, could only be accepted if it were kept absolutely secret. On receiving this report, I urged the Government of India to consider a contribution in money or kind towards the improvement of the roads in south-eastern Afghanistan, subject to its being possible (as desired by the Afghan Prime Minister) to avoid publicity in regard to any expenditure of this nature. The Government of India have this question under consideration. A contribution to the Afghan Government for this purpose has much to recommend it, but the condition of secrecy imposed by the Afghan Prime Minister obviously creates a great difficulty. 6. With reference to the Afghan Government’s requestV® 4. request for purchase of munitions s Muhamr ad Ha shim mz asked t' specify their requirements and the terms of payment proposed. He promised to discuss this matter further 5 but the Afghan Government are still not ready for such discussion, because throughout this year they have been considering, but have not yet decided, the method of re-arming their forces (e.g. whether, and to uhat extent, with *303 rifles) and the s urces of supply. Sir R. Meconachie has pointed out to them the a' vantage of maintaining the *303 standard in case of an emergency (i.e. a war with Russia), and has informed them that we have large stocks in this country which could be sold at a reasonable price. He considers, and the Government of India agree, that until they have reached a decision on the general question of the re-armament of their forces (as to which he thinks their acute financial stringency may be a delaying factor), it would be a mistake to press them further. '/• The important results of the conversations which have taken place this year are that, by our readiness to comply with the Afghan Government’s requests for munitions and military consultation, we have shown our sympathy with them in their difficulties; we have reassured them as to our friendly attitude by reminding them of the declarations of policy already made; it has been wade clear that they arc satisfied with these declarations, and do not expect or require a speciiic promise of military support; we have received an assurance that the policy of the Afghan Government continues to be one of sincere friendship and co-operation with His hajo sty’s Government, and it is clear that there is no present danger oi their adopting a pro-Russian policy or entering into any un ise commitment to Russia as a result either of Soviet thrcats or caio1ery. c. In accordance with paragraph (d) of the Cabinet Conclusions o] 14th March last, I took up with the Departments concornod the form of a statement to be made to the Afahan Go v c r nmo n t5 . government if s contrary to present indications 5 a further statement of our intentions should become necessary, her cement has been reached, on the form of statement attached, in which the Government of India and His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul have also demi-officially signified their concurrence. 9. L recent event of some interest has been the entry of Afghanistan into the League of Nations. The ^fghan Government had been considering this step for some years past, and had asked our advice. We had let them know that we favoured Afghanistan’s entry into the League, as we considered that her posifion would be strengthened thereby. We know that the Afghan decision was taken after consultation with Turkey, and it is clear that it was not the outcome of any suggestion by the Soviet Governmont. In a sense it was occasioned by the entry of the Soviet Union, because, so long as Russia the Afghan Government feared that accession by Afghanistan would be regarded as evidence that she was unduly under our influence and opposed to Russia. In this way therefore the adhesion of Russia to the League removed the last obstacle to Afghanisfan’s own entry. 30th November 1934.Register No. 'sy- SECRET.

Maconachie, on 21st April and again on 29th May, spoke to the Prime Minister about the Afghan i requirements of munitions and the terms of payment proposed. Muhammad Hashim promised discussion of the matter, but the Afghan Govt, are still not ready for this, the reason being that they have been considering, but have not yet decided, the method of arming their forces and the sources of supply. The G. of I. somewhat dislike the idea of supplying .303 rifles and ammunition, for much the same reason as that expressed by the Afghan War Minister to Mr. Lawson. This objection, however, is considered by H.M.G. to be outbalanced by the advantage of maintaining the .303 rifle as the standard of Afghan armament in case of a war with Russia. Sir R. Maconachie, at his interview on 25th September, pointed out the advantage of maintaining this standard in case of an emergency, and informed the Afghan Govt, that we have large stocks in this country which could be sold at a reasonable price. We might send a telegram stating that we accept the Minister’s view, expressed in para. 6 of his telegram, with which the G. of I.

The question of procedure in regard to supplying any Afghan requirements in rifles on payment is complicated by the facts that, if such rifles are supplied from surplus stocks in this country, it is more convenient to the W.O. that they should be bought direct from the Soley Armament Co., and that the W.O. even now are unable to state a minimum price, as suggested by the G. of I. in para. 6 of their telegram of 16th June (P.Z. 4046/34). It would be of advantage if the W.O. could ascertain from the firm what the minimum price woul be, so that we could give this information to Sir R. Maconachie, though not necessarily at this stage for communication to the Afghan Govt.

I am to explain that the sole rights of purchase and re-sale of these rifles are for the present vested in B.S.A. (Guns) Ltd., of Birmingham, who are employing the Soley Armament Company, Ltd., of 0, Park Village Last, London, IJ.V/. 1, as their representatives in the matter. One of the reasons for this Agreement, with B.S.A. Guns Ltd., was that the War Department encountered difficulties in dealing direct with the foreign Governments desirous of purchasing the rifles, and found that the transactions could be more conveniently carried through by a third party. 3. In the present case, the Council have reason to believe that the Afghan Minister in London has already been in touch with the Soley Armament Company in regard to the purchase of surplus Army rifles of the 1914 pattern. Unless therefore, the Indian authorities or H.M. Minister at Kabul have grounds for thinking that negotiations carried out direct with the Afghan Government are more likely to be successful., the Council would suggest that H.M. Minister should be asked to acquaint the Afghan Government with the fact that B. S.A. ( Guns) Ltd. , working through the Soley Armament Company, have at present the selling rights of the 1914 pattern rifle on behalf of the War Department, and that if the Afghan Government will communicate with these agents through its Minister in London, the Army Council for their part will ensure that the agents do their utmost to meet the Afghan requirements at a very reasonable price. The The Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department, /C ounci 1Council would 'be glad if H.M. ilinister would do all he can on these lines to encourage the Afghan Government to purchase these rifles. If this course is followed the Council suggest that it would not he politic at this stage to quote a minimum price. If, hmvever, it is considered that a direct deal is preferable, the Council will endeavour to arrange accordingly with the B.S.A. Company (who, of course, have certain contractual rights in the matter.) 4. In the case of a direct deal, the question would arise whether negotiations should he carried out hy H.M. Minister at Kabul, or the Indian Government locally, or the War Office with the Afghan Minister in London, and the Council would he glad of the views of your Department on this point. If the negotiations were carried out hy H.M. Minister or the Indian Government the Council would, of course, he prepared to advise what the minimum price should he. 5 . I am to add that a large stock of surplus .303' ammunition could also he offered to the Afghan Government at very reasonable terms if they would take' the rifles. 6 . I am further to add that with reference to paragraph 3 of your letter. Ho.

Maconachie that, if he saw no objection, he might remind Muhammad Hashim of the latter’s proposal to discass the question of monitions further. It now appears that Sir R. Maconachie has already, at an interview on 29th May, reminded the Afghan Prime Minister once of this proposal, and the latter that he woold let him know when matters were ready for . discussion. The Minister thinks that it would be bad tactics to put in another reminder at present, because roundabout confidences, probably inspired by the War Minister, are being made to him as to quotations received from foreign firms, and he estimates that the Afghan Govt, wish to buy British rifles if possible, but before discussion with him are collecting data with which to beat down British quotations. In other words, the collection of quotations from foreign countries is not to be taken too seriously. Such a procedure on the part of the Afghan Govt, would be quite in accord with all past experience of their bargaining methods. In the circumstances, Sir R. Maconachie thinks that it would be unwise to do anything which could be regarded as betraying anxiety. We should, I think - more especially in the circumstances explained - continue to leave it to Sir R. Maconachie's discretion to find an opportunity for taking the action suggested in our telegram of 5th July. A draft telegram is submitted. It will also be of advantage if, when the Minister’s discussion with theAfghan Prime Minister takes place, the former is able to state the price at which .303'' rifles could be supplied from this country (a question on which we are still awaiting information from the W.O.).

MilV* Dept., For favour of any observations on the G. of I.*8 telegram of 16th June. please see also the W.O. letter of 15th June. It does not seem possible to reconcile what would best suit our requirements in the various and conflicting contingencies of (a) a war in which we were supporting Afghanistan; (b) a war in which we were fighting Afghanistan; or (c) trouble with the tribes in which the latter were supported by the Afghan Govt., or following disturbances in Afghanistan during which the tribes had looted the Afghan arsenals. It seems clear that whatever suits us best in contingency (a) is bound to some extent to militate against us in contingency (b), and vice versa. 2119 5000 8/33 It seems to me that there is a certain amount of special pleading in the G. of I.’s telegram. If in the event of a war with Russia the Afghan troops in the Southern and Eastern provinces are not already armed with .303 rifles, will it be easy to rearm them with this weapon at a time when we might presumably require all our supplies for the expansion of our own forces? If, however, the Afghan Govt, have decided to arm their in the Southern and Eastern Provinces with rifles of other than .303 bore, they are not likely to be deflected from this purpose by our arguments; and it is true that, for the reasons stated by the G. of I., supply by Japan is unobjectionable in comparison to supply from certain other/ \other non-British sources. Subject to your views and those of the F.O. and W.0. , the proposal contained in para. 6 of the G. of I^s telegram as to the action which might be taken by H.M. Minister at Kabul, differing somewhat though it does from the instructions in our telegram of 23rd May, might be considered unobjectionable. In any case, we must not lose sight of the Cabinet decision on the question of the Afghan request of 12th October last to purchase rifles from us W The S. of S., in his memo, to the Cabinet] of 9th March, recommended that the Minister should agre0 to this request if the G. of I., on receiving information as to the Afghan requirements and the basis of payment proposed, agree to the sale and are able to supply the arms; the S. of S. added that he had no reason to doubt that it would be possible to persuade the G. of I. to agree. As part (perhaps the greater part) of the Afghan forces will continue to be armed with .303 rifles, the Afghan Govt, will presumably still wish to purchase from us on reasonable terms. The position in regard to this is that on 21st April Sir R. Maconachie asked their requirements and the terms of payment proposed, and the Prime Minister said that he would consult the War Minister and then discuss the matter. I suggest that we should now ask Sir R. Maconachie to remind the Afghan Prime Minister of this question, and ascertain the requirements of the Afghans/® I' Minute Paper. Department. Afghans and their suggestions as to terms (instructing him at the same time that he may give the information suggested in the W.O.letter of 15 June). On receiving information of the requirements and suggested terms, we could either press the G.of I. to supply the requirements, or else supply them from surplus stocks in this country if serviceable rifles can be supplied from the latter at a lower price than that at which the G.of I. are able and willing to supply them. The question, raised in the last sentence of the G.of I's telegram, of the minimum price at which serviceable rifles can be supplied from this country is therefore of some importance, and we might asi the W.O. to let us have this information as soon as possible. 'S;4 Zy 2119 5000 8/33 Personally I do not anticipate any specially serious difficulty in re-arming the Afghan troops in the Eastern and Southern Provinces with -303 inch rifles when an emergency arises. All the same this difficulty might be a useful argument for Maconachie. 3. Supply by Japan is certainly less objectionable than from other and non-British sources. 3* I agree that the Afghan Prime Minister should be approached again regarding Afghan requirements in arms and teims of payment. But, to strengthen Maconachie 1 s hands we should be able to tell him what we are prepared to accept for our surplus stocks of *303 rifles. I concur, therefore, in asking the War Office to letlet us know as soon as possible what is their minimum price and in informing Maconachie and the Govt* of India x J yt^ir J * accordingly. f.%. ru: f&lt;s, As it may take time to obtain information of the minimum price of .303 rifles in store in this country, it seems advisable to telegraph general instructions to Kabul at once, reserving information on this point for a supplementary telegram. Para. 6 of the 0. of I.’s telegram as expressed is somewhat off the mark, since there has never been any question of our ’’making a protest', but only of suggesting to the Afghans the advantages to themselves of maintaining the .303 standard. The last paragraph of the draft telegram attempts to give effect to what the G. of I. apparently have in mind. If you concur in the draft telegram, it might be as well to show it to the V/.0. and see if they agree before it goes to the F.0, for concurrence. be U &lt;/ *’/-* £ «Aw h, w 'r^ /•&gt;**?

Meanwhile, I suggest that, if you see no objection, you might remind Afghan Prime Minister of his proposal to discuss question of munitions further with you (para. 3 of your telegram of 23rd April, No. 58). I appreciate possibility that he may not be able to state precise extent of his requirements until views of British military advisers on defence of northern road are obtained. But he may be able to state in general what categories of munitions seem likely to be required. Previous conversations seem to indicate that Afghan Govt, had artillery, aircraft and machineguns principally in mind. If this supposition were confirmed, it would help to clear the ground, in view of G. of I^s apprehension/Department. apprehension of risks involved in supplying rifles (see para. 6 of despatch to G. of I. of 10th May, 1934). 4.

It is, therefore, clear that first consideration urged by Hie Majesty's Government applies solely to situation in which we might co-operate with Afghan Army in resisting Russian aggression.

The task of holding up Russian advance will fall in the first place, at any rate, on troops in Northern Provinces and Kabul corps,who will now, if scheme goes through, receive »303 rifles in place of other weapons.

Sir, \ % \' I am commanded trli® Army ilolmcil to acknovvledge receipt of India Office letter No. P.Z. 2732/34 dated 26th April, 1934, on the subject of the reported intention of the Afghan Government to rearm part of their army with rifles of bore other than .303-inch. In reply, I am to state as follows for the infomation of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare. 2. In the event of our having to support Afghanistan against Russian aggression, one of our most important and immediate means of rendering assistance to'the Afghan Government will undoubtedly be by gifts or loans of arms and ammunition to the Afghan Army. The Council are of opinion, therefore, that it is most desirable that the standard rifle armament of the Afghan Army should be the .303-inch rifle, supplies of which, with ammunition, would be available from British sources. The Council consider that re-armament with a rifle of different bore is most undesirable, as the inevitable difficulties of supply might have the effect of seriously lowering the fighting value of the Afghan troops at a most critical period in the operations. 3. If the Afghans were to adopt a foreign rifle, the Council fear it might be difficult to keep a check on the number of rifles and the amount of ammunition imported into Afghanistan. 4. The Council are of opinion that it is most undesirable that a foreign power should supply arms to Afghanistan, and thus establish themselves in a position from which they might in time be able to influence Afghan policy.

The possibility of supplying rifles from British sources can then be considered. 6. As regards the question as to whether rifles of bore other than .303-inch can be supplied by British firms, the Council are of opinion that, from the limited information immediately available, it appears unlikely that British firms will be able to supply such rifles at prices which would compare favourably with those of foreign competitors. This is an additional reason for using our influence to persuade the Afghan Government to adhere to the .303-inch rifle as the standard type for their Army. 7.

For ”10,000 rifles” should be read ”30,000 rifles”. Some time ago I heard vague rumours that the loss of some rifles during the Khost disturbances of 1933 had led the Afghan kinistry of v/ar to doubt the wisdom of having adopted the British .303 rifle as their standard armament, since ammunition for such rifles was already available in fair quantities to the tribes of the Southern Province. There seems therefore no reason to regard the present proposal as being ”anti-British” m intention, or indeed actuated by any other motive than that given for it. If this view is correct, the significance of the proposal is purely military, and, as such, need not be discussed by me.mmConfidential. / Extract from Kabul Military Attache's Diary do. 14, for week ending 6th April, 1934. x x nmy . x X X 34.

SECRET &amp; PERSONAL, THE WAR OFFICE, LONDON, S.W. 1. 2nd May, 1934. My dear Jock, You asked me to make tentative enquiries regarding the possibility of rifles other than .303 being supplied to the Afghan Government. I send you herewith:- (a) , a copy of a note by the Assistant Director of Army Contracts, War Office; and (b) . a copy of the letter from B.S.A. Guns, Ltd., to which reference is made in (a) above. I fear that this does not take us very much further but I do not see what else we can do for the moment. I ought to add that a representative of B.S.A. Guns Ltd., called on us and was told, in confidence, the possible destination of the rifles. He said that if anything should materialize they would be ready to send a man by air with simples to Kabul to put through the contract on the spot. Colonel J.C. Macrae, D.S.O., Military Department, India office, S.W.l.COPY Please see enclosed letter from 3.S.A. Guns Ltd. If the quantity required were in the neighbourhood of 80,000, as stated in Telegram No.61, from Kabul, dated 23,4.1934, it is probable that Vickers-Armstrongs would also be interested. We believe that the Soley Armament Coy., have prepared a scheme whereby the Army surplus .303 rifles could be converted to another calibre and it is possible that under such a scheme, rifles to suit the requirements of the Afghan Government could be offered at a lower price than that quoted by B.S.A.

MANAGUMUNT WPj/gaJ. 28th April 1934 The Director of Army Contracts, Caxton House ’Test, Tot hill Street, T3STMINST3R• S.W.l. Dear Sir, For t he Attention of Ivlr. Bell* In reference to our telephonic conversation this morning, as requested, we beg to give you the following approximate quotation and delivery date for the supply of 20,000 Rifles L.3. Mark III, pattern. We understand that you wish us to suggest some calibre other than the .303 M . The calibre which we can offer you and which entails the least alteration for the L.B. action and magazine is the 8mm., .3 15, Mannlieher, to which the L.3. action is easily adapted. This cartridge is loaded with 40 grain smokeless powder and 244 grain metal covered solid nosed bullet - maximum pressure 15 tons per sq. inch. With this type of cartridge the capacity of the magazine is limited to 8 rounds instead of the standard 10 rounds for .303 ammunition. The following estimate which we give you is approximate only, and is given subject to material prices maintaining present levels. We have not, however, sufficient material in stock to cover the necessary stocks, handguards and fore-ends, and the time is too short to enable us to make enquiries regarding current prices, so that if these are increased appreciably, it will mean a corresponding increase in our prices. Subject to the above, we could undertake thesupply of 20,000 short Magazine L.3. Rifles, British Service pattern (but to take the 8 mm. cartridge as above) at approximately £6.5.0. each, packed and delivered f.o.b. English port. This price is for the supply of arms subject to an upright view only as a completed arm, but if detailed Government inspection were called for, the price would be increased by approximately 10/-d. per rifle. This quotation does not include slings or bayonets and scabbards, all of which, if required, would be extra. Delivery. We could commence delivery in approximately 4 months from Receipt of an order, at a rate of about 400 per week, increasing up to 700 per week, to complete in 14 months• It must be clearly understood that this quotation and delivery promise is given subject to our commitments at the time any contemplated order is placed, as if we had then entered into any contract, it would affect our ability to give the delivery stated. Payment. ?e presume any contract for these rifles would be entered into between the War Office and ourselves, in which case our usual terms of payment for British Government Contracts would be acceptable to us. If, however, the contract is to be entered into directly between ourselves and any Third party, our usual terms of payment in such cases would apply, viz. we should require a deposit of 25$ of the total amount with the order, the balance to be deposited on irrevocable credit at an approved London Bank for payment against shipping documents, ot such other terms as may be arranged to our satisfaction. We have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servants, B.S.A. Guns Limited. (Sgd) W.F. James SSCR3TARYkelerence Tel. Wo.61 from H.B.M. at abul dated 23.4.54. 1 The \lghan Kegular Army, strength about 43,000# ia at present armed wiVi the .303 rifle and varioue foreign rifles, but, according\to liiformation compiled by the General Staff India, the .305 rifle has been laid down as the standard type. The Afghan tribesmen - the real strength of Afghanistan - are armed, with a heterogendoua collection of rifles, but the .303 probably predominates. In 1930, the Government oi India presented the late King Nadir Shah with 10,000 rifles to help him to consolidate hie position on the throne. Gince that date the following are the consignments of riflea and ammunition purchased by the Afghan Government (as far as M.?.2.(a)’a recorde show} (i) 5,000 .303 rifles and 5 million rounds of ammunition (from the Government of India). (li) 8,000 British rifles (presumebly .303) and 6 million rounds of 3.A. . purchased through a Captain Fleming as a result of a deal between him and Clemenceau. (ill) 3,000 rifles purchased from Poland with ? million rounds of S.A.A. e do not know the calibre of the rifles, but the S.A.A. was a. porently of British manufacture and in bad condition. (iv) 5, 30 rifles and 5 million roa:.da oi G.A. *. from Germai^. e are not quite sure whether these were actually delivered. (v) 1,000 rifles with S.A.A. from Turkey. (vij \ few rifles and small am untu of G. &lt;.a. were purchased from surplus war stocks in thi&amp; country. 4. Tt seems likely that cheapness is at the bottom of the Afghan intention to purchase rifles other than .303. They hnve probably been told by the Japanese, who have recently been in Kabul,.that rifles at a very low rate are availrtle. In addition, the Afghan Government must be aware that, ot the present time# there sre l^rge stocks of foreign rifles «t cheap rates available in the European market. The Germans can mlwmys make arrangements through hutch firms in which they undoubtedly have considerable interests. , 6. A change from the .303 rifle would be detrimental to our interests# in vie^ of the fact that we may have tc go to Afghanistan's assistance at some time in the future. ith an Afghan Army using foreign rifles# the supply of extra rifles anti ammunition would be greatly complicated. 6.

The Cabinet agreed - (a) To reaffirm the previous policy of regarding the independence’and integrity of Afghanistan as essential to the defence of India and the Empire (b) That the British Minister at Kabul, in answering the enquiries addressed to him by the Afghan Government regarding (i) the sale to them of arms at reasonable prices by the Government of India; and (ii) advice as to the defence of their northern road should be instructed to proceed on the lines of paragraph 14 of the Secretary of State for India*s Memorandum and to report further for instructions if, m the course of the talks, there emerged any need for a further declaration of policy: (c) That the question of the improvement of the road fronTLandi Kotal to Kabul would naturally come up m connection with the discussions on the defence of the road over the Hindu Kush: (d) That the Secretary of State for India should take up with the Government Departments concerned the form of the statement to be made to the Afghan Government if, contrary to present indications, a further statement of our intentions should become necessary: (e) That the British Minister at Kabul should be instructed to take appropriate action to remove the impression'of'the Afghan Government that developments in India indicate an impending abdication of His Majesty’s Government[This Document is the Property oi His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] Printed for the Cabinet. March 1934. SECRET. O.P. 61 (34). Copy No CABINET. Memorandum for the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India. Policy in regard to Afghanistan. Questions for Decision. It is desirable to keep clearly distinguished the two questions which are before the Cabinet: (1) whether the policy last reaffirmed in 1928 in regard to the integrity of Afghanistan still holds good, and (2) if so, whether to acquaint the Afghan Government with our policy, or what instructions to give to our Minister at Kabul. If, as I think, the first question should be answered in the affirmative, we have then to consider separately the second question, to which quite different considerations apply. Reaffirmation of Policy of 1928. 2. The policy reaffirmed in 1928 is, briefly, that the preservation of the independence and integrity of Afghanistan as a buffer State between Russia and India is of so great importance to Indian and Imperial interests that any substantial Russian encroachment into northern Afghanistan must be treated as a casus belli in the last resort. We now have the report of the Chiefs of the Staff that no military factors have arisen since 1928 which would make it impossible to implement this policy, and I need not dilate on the cogent arguments in favour of the policy itself, as they are familiar to my colleagues. But 1 would lay stress on the fact that the policy requires not only the independence, but the integrity of Afghanistan. As the Chiefs of Staff point out, if Russia were to conquer Afghanistan, Russia and India would then have a common frontier of some 500 miles in length. I would merely add that our buffer State policy would equally be defeated by a Russian occupation of northern Afghanistan alone up to the Hindu Kush. For a State consisting only of the south-eastern portions of Afghanistan, deprived of the richer northern provinces, would not constitute an effective buffer ; in order to prevent Russian domination of this small and impoverished State, we might well have to take it under our protection and effective control, and we should then have a common frontier Avith Russia in just the same way as if Russia conquered the whole country. This point may have some relevance, as I will hope to show, to the question whether we should acquaint the Afghan Government with our policy. Question of giving the Afghan Government an Assurance of Military Support. 3. The next question is whether, and, if so, what information can be given to the Afghan Government regarding our policy ; whether, in other words, Ave can give them some assurance beyond those already given of the action which Ave Avould take to preserve the integrity of their country, such as the assurance recommended by the Government of India of military support against military aggression by the Soviet. I Avould emphasise here that this is a neAv proposal, which Avas not recommended by any of the authorities in 1928. It has now been raised for the first time, and not by His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, but by the Government of India. Grounds advanced by Government of India for their Proposal. 4. There are two main grounds on Avhich the Government of India propose that we should volunteer an assurance of this character to the Afghan Government. In the first place, while it is common ground that “ at present the SoA T iet Government neither intend nor are able to take the offensive against Afghanistan,” the Government of India suggest that the natural nervousness of the Afghans regarding the possibility of such an offensive may induce them “ to adopt a pro-Russian policy against their better judgment, ’ and that the Afghan Prime Minister may “feel compelled to come to terms Avith the Soviet as the only means of saving his country.” In the second 2636 80 3.34 A2 place, they suggest that an assurance of military support should be given in order that we may have the opportunity of concerting measures of defence in co-operation with the Afghans, and in particular induce them to improve the roads from India to Kabul and Kandahar up to a high standard. i Assurances already given to the Afghan Government. 5. I will deal first with the argument that the large commitment proposed by the Government of India is necessary because the Afghans may otherwise feel compelled to yield to the embraces of Russia. In this connection I would venture to remind my colleagues of the extent of the assurances which we have already given the Afghan Government and to draw attention to the very marked anti Russian trend of the policy of that Government, In order that there may be no misapprehension as to what we have already told the Afghan Government, I append (Annex A) a summary of the questions which they asked in 1931 and 1932 and of the replies which we gave to those questions. It will be seen that the Afghan Ministers asked whether they could count on any kind of support from His Majesty’s Government (without specifying military support), and what would be the attitude if the Soviet attacked Afghanistan. The carefully considered replies, embodying extensive assurances, which were given were favourably received on each occasion. In 1931 the Afghan Foreign Minister said that the reply was all that his Government could reasonably expect, and in 1932 the Prime Minister expressed his appreciation of the reply, and noted particularly the very important statement that, if the Soviet attacked Afghanistan, this would be regarded by us as an attack on British and Indian interests, and would force us to take the steps normally taken by the Government of a State when its interests are seriously threatened. Requests made by Afghan Government last October. 6. Since the Afghan Government received the assurances which the Cabinet decided on in 1932, they have not again raised the question of our attitude in the event of Russian aggression, nor asked for any further assurances. What they have now asked for is— (1) consultation with the British General Staff in connection with the defence of the northern road ; and (2) arms, ammunition and aircraft on payment by instalments. These requests were made on 12th October 1933, and though they have not since been pressed or renewed, the British Minister is naturally auxious to take some step towards replying as soon as possible. As regards a supply of munitions, though the Government of India have themselves raised certain difficulties, I think that these can be overcome, and if the Government of India agree to sell the arms, this request can be satisfactorily met. As regards the other request, the Minister himself recom mended, and the Government of India agreed, that it should in the first instance be dealt with in the manner proposed in the joint memorandum of 2nd February. That proposal was that Sir R. Maconachie should have an informal talk with the Afghan Prime Minister with a view to showing His Majesty’s Government’s sympathetic interest in his problems and ascertaining exactly what he had in mind in making his request (after which the Minister could be authorised to promise military advice on the defence of the northern road with the Afghans’ own resources if this is what they desire). This step is the gesture that Sir R. Maconachie has been anxiously waiting to be allowed to make (which is referred to in paragraph 24 (c) of Lord Hailsham’s letter of 8th February) in order to give the Afghans “reason to think that we are taking their requests seriously.” In telegraphing thus Sir R. Maconachie was not referring to any pending replies to the Afghan Government as to our attitude in the event of Russian aggression, for these replies were given long ago. Sir R. Maconachie*s Appreciation of existing Policy of Afghan Government, and his Views on Question of the Proposed Assurance. 7. In view of what is known of the Anglophil policy of the Afghan Government based on a realisation of the community of British and Afghan interests, and having regard also to the nature of the assurances which we have already given, I felt that the Government of India were greatly exaggerating the risk of the Afghans beingintimidated into the adoption of a pro-Russian policy. But as the question is in any case one on which our Minister at Kabul is best qualified to advise, I suggested to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that it would be desirable to obtain from Sir Li. Maconachie a first-hand appreciation of the recent trend of the policy of the Afghans as between this country and Russia, and of the existence and degree of any jflsk of their adopting a pro-Russian policy. A telegram of enquiry was accordingly sent to him (Annex B). His reply of 3rd March (Annex B) gives a most illuminating appreciation, which speaks for itself and to which I would draw the special attention of my colleagues. It confirms our previous information that the Afghan Government is definitely embarked on a pro-British and anti-Russian policy. Ever since the accession of Nadir (whose success in stabilising his regime was largely due to the handsome present of &lt;£175,000 and 10,000 rifles sanctioned by the Cabinet in July 1930), the Afghans have been drawing continuously closer to us and away from Russia. Sir R. Maconachie gives numerous recent examples which lead him to tho conclusion that “ there is no indication that the Afghan Government have departed from their original policy of preserving and strengthening the British connection, and at the same time humouring Russia (whom they look on as the real enemy) with concessions in what they regard as unessentials.” Pro-British Policy of Afghan Government. 8. I would add that Nadir and his Ministers have constantly turned to Sir R. Maconachie for consultation, and in regard, for example, to frontier matters, have adopted a policy of co-operation with us, to the extent even of aiding us in the control of the frontier by giving wholesome advice to our dissident tribesmen when they turned to the Afghan Government, in accordance with their age-long practice, for countenance and support. In particular, the Afghan Government have always sought our advice in regard to their dealings with Russia, and it is not too much to say that by the policy which we have pursued we have entirely won their confidence. This definite orientation of their policy, for which great credit is due to Sir R. Maconachie, seems indeed to have been specially noteworthy since they received our assurances of 1932. It will be remembered that the reason for giving those assurances was to stiffen Afghan resistance to certain dangerous demands which had at that date been made by the Soviet in regard (inter alia) to the renewal of Amanullah’s permit for the air service between Termez and Kabul, and a commercial treaty of the dangerous type usual in the dealings of the Soviet Government with their Asiatic neighbours. The position now is that these demands have been rejected and have not since been renewed. Arrangements according closely with the advice we gave have been made for the exchange of goods with Russia, and the air service merely continues on sufferance till the northern road is fit for normal traffic. A further remarkable development is that during the last 12 months the Afghan Government—well aware of the political dangers, of Soviet economic penetration—appear to be doing all in their power (as will be seen from the instances cited by Sir R. Maconachie) to encourage trade with India and this country through the foreign trade monopoly which they recently established. Perhaps the most important Afghan export is Persian lamb, in which the Soviet are geographically well placed for obtaining a monopoly. The Afghan Government have sought to counter this Soviet advantage by giving encourage ment to British traders in this commodity. On 4th January last an agreement was signed for the supply of petrol from India, to which our Minister rightly attaches considerable importance. The Afghan Government have purchased from Marconi material for two wireless installations at Khanabad and Herat, and have invited tenders for a large station at Kabul from the same firm, as well as from German, French and Japanese competitors. Arrangements for the import of dyes and chemicals are in contemplation under conditions which would probably be favourable for a contract with Imperial Chemical Industries (from whom also other orders have been carried through or are under consideration). Two further important facts are that the Afghan Government have agreed to receive a trade delegation from India to discuss the expansion of trade between India and Afghanistan and that the appointment to London of a representative of the Afghan state trading organi sation has been under consideration. All these unprecedented efforts, encouraged by our Minister, to foster trade with us are undoubtedly actuated by political motives and appear to signify a recent acceleration in the movement of Afghanistan towards us and away from Russia. Moreover, the theory of intimidation by the Soviet is not4 'borne out by recent secret information, which shows that the Afghan Government have taken a most firm stand in regard to certain matters. Anti-Russian Temperament of Afghan Prime Minister. 9. Finallv, we must bear in mind the personality of the piesent Afghan Inm^^ Minister, Muhammad Hashim, uncle of the young King and real ruler of the country It is well known that one of his principal characteristics is his dislike of the Soviet, dating from the time when he was Amanullah s Ambassadoi at Moscow. Sir R. Maconachie has twice recently reported that he has no reason to think that the Afghan Government would commit themselves seriously to Russia so long as the present Prime Minister is in power. It is true that Muhammad ilashnn s life cannot be regarded as a very safe one. But his disappearance would probably be followed by a period of internal disturbance and possibly even anarchy, during which there would be no stable Afghan Government that we could make the recipient ot further assurances or possibly even recognise. Is it necessary to give Afghan Government an Assurance of Military Support ? 10. I have troubled my colleagues with these facts regarding our present relations with the Afghan Government and the assurances which we have already given them, because they are relevant to the question whether there is any grave danger of our “ driving the Afghans into the arms of Russia ” unless we now give them a further assurance. We have an Afghan Government which, by a just appreciation of its own true interests, is pro-British and anti-Russian ; we have recently given them certain significant assurances to strengthen them against their fear of Soviet pressure ; their policy has recently been marked by, if anything, an even more pronounced pro- British trend, and they show no signs of any serious commitment to Russia or of being intimidated into compliance with Soviet demands. Is it, then, necessary for us to enter into the far-reaching commitment recommended by the Government of India for the purpose of preventing the adoption by the Afghan Government of a pro- Russian policy against their better judgment ? As this is a new proposal, the burden of proof lies, of course, on those who make it. Government of India's desire for Improvement of Roads to Kabul and Kandahar. 11. The second ground on which the Government of India support their recommendation is that if we inform the Afghan Government of our policy of military support we shall gain the advantage of concerting measures of defence with them, and especially that we shall be able to induce them to improve the roads from the Indian frontier to Kabul and Kandahar up to the standard required to enable us to give effective military support when the time comes. As regards this, Sir R. Maconachie has separately reported that the Afghan Government are already committed to the effective improvement of these roads, though their standard of construction is not likely in the ordinary course to be so high as to satisfy our militarv requirements. He has suggested two alternatives to an assurance of military support. The first is that we should inform the Afghan Government that, while it is impossible to commit ourselves to a definite assurance in the unknown circumstances of any future contingency, it would in fact be impracticable to give them military assistance unless these roads were first greatly improved. The second would be to give a substantial contribution in money, either from His Majesty’s Government or the Government of India, towards the improvement of these roads. This alternative would be in accordance with the principle recommended in paragraph 53 (a) of the Defence of India Committee’s Report of 1927 and with the policy of occasional “ subsidy in kind ” towards projects which promote the mutual interests of Afghanistan and ourselves. Disadvantages of giving the proposed Assurance. 12. I must now touch on the disadvantages, as they appear to me, of the proposed assurance of military support. They are as follows :— (i) It will be remembered that the Defence of India Committee of 1927 concluded against informing the Afghans of our policy because of the danger that Amanullah would adopt an arrogant attitude towards Russia, and we should then “ have surrendered the issues of peace or war with the Soviet to the5 incalculable actions of an unbalanced and unscrupulous barbarian.” With the disappearance of the impulsive Amanullali and the establishment of the present regime this danger is Jess than it was. But we have to remember that since the assassination of Nadir the stability of the present Government is again less secure than we could wisli, and that, in the event of its falling, we cannot foresee the character of tlie Government that may succeed it. Moreover, whereas Nadir’s cautious temperament could have been safely relied on, Muhammad Hashim is temperamentally anti-Russian, aud the risk of his adopting a provocative attitude cannot be entirely discounted. If, however, it were decided to give the suggested assurance, it would be possible to some extent to guard against this particular danger of a provocative Afghan attitude towards Russia by means of a careful caveat. (ii) A public announcement of our policy would, of course, be open to over whelming objections, among others to those that are clearly explained in paragrapli 2 of the Government of India’s Despatch of 4th January (O.P. 40 (34)). The primary desideratum of our policy at present must be to preserve and strengthen the stability of the Afghan regime, shaken as it must have been by the assassination of Nadir. The chief menace to its stability comes from the propaganda of disaffected Afghans and the Soviet to the effect that the regime is subservient to British interests. A public announcement of our policy would be represented by these enemies of the Afghan Government as meaning that the latter had sold their country to the British, and this would be “ extremely damaging, if not fatal, to the present Government in Afghanistan.” A public announcement is therefore out of the question ; but the point to which 1 would draw the attention of my colleagues is that the same unfortunate consequences would be likely to ensue from even a confidential assurance in proportion as it leaked out, and that it might be very difficult to keep it confidential and at the same time to obtain the advantages, which the Government of India look for, of concerting measures of defence and ensuring (presumably by inspection) a high standard of road construction in Afghanistan. (iii) On the other hand, an unpublished assurance cannot constitute an inter national engagement, because such unpublished engagements are forbidden by Article 18 of the Covenant of the League of Nations and declared not to be binding. Consequently, an assurance could only amount to a statement of our present policy. This means that, looking at the matter from the Afghan point of view, there would in the nature of the case be some uncertainty as to its durability. It seems to me essential that we should leave the Afghans under no illusion as to this degree of uncertainty. For if it is not made clear to them, and if by any chance when the time for action comes there were a change of policy, the assurance which they thought they had received would not be implemented, or not so fully as they expected, and this would have the most disastrous consequences on our reputation for good faith throughout Asia. It would, therefore, in my view, be necessary to make it clear that any statement which we made to the Afghan Government did not go beyond a statement of present policy, with the element of uncertainty that that involves. But the question, of course, then arises whether such a statement would be of appreciably greater value to the Afghan Government than the assurances which we have already given them. (iv) In the military conversations for concerting measures of defence which, as proposed by the Government of India, would follow a statement of our policy, the Afghans might well ask us awkward questions to which, in the present state of our military plan, we might find it difficult to give such replies as they would consider satisfactory. For, while 1 understand that the General Staffs at home and in India are agreed on the fii’st phase of the operations, which would take us to the line Kabul-Kandahar, I am not aware that agreement yet exists as to a plan, or alternative plans, for the second phase—i.e. the question (which to the Afghans must be all-important) of the means^ to be employed for forcing the Russians out of the northern provinces. Unless in the discussion of measures of defence we could satisfy the Afghans that we had a pretty clear idea of the means, not only of defending Kabul, but of Ireeing their country from the invader, it is to be feared that the Afghans might lose heart; they might doubt whether we had the effective means ol securing the political objective, namely, the 2636 bG integrity of Afghanistan, or whether we took sufficient interest in their northern provinces to justify them in relying on our military support; with characteristic suspicion they might even doubt whether the integrity of Afghanistan is our primary concern. In any of these cases the result of our declaration to them might be the reverse of what we hoped for, and defeat our own purpose of stiffening their resistance to possible Soviet pressure. ^ Conclusion. 13. In view of the various considerations suggested above—the fact that we have already given the Afghans extensive assurances ; the pro-llritish trend of their policy, and the disadvantages of a speciiic assurance of military support—it appears to me that the further assurance proposed by the Government of India is neither necessary nor advisable. It can hardly be considered necessary merely for the purpose of the improvement of the roads from India to Kabul and Kandahar, for it should be possible to provide for this by other means, and it cannot in any case be a matter of great urgency since it is agreed that Russia at present has neither the will nor the power for a military offensive against Afghanistan. As regards the other argument, that the proposed assurance is necessary for the purpose of preventing the adoption of a pro Russian policy by the Afghans, I think my colleagues will agree that this is contrary to all the weight of the evidence. My views on this point are more than confirmed by the careful conclusion of our Minister at Kabul in paragraph 16 of his telegram of 3rd March, that for the purpose of guarding against this supposed risk there is no necessity in existing circumstances and in such probable future conditions as he can foresee for the assurance proposed by the Government of India (nor even, he adds—so far as this risk is concerned—for a promise of arms or military conversations about the northern road). Naturally, if at some future time the position should be materially altered by conditions at present unforeseen, it will always be open to us to reconsider the question whether we can enlarge the assurances which we have already given. Rut in present conditions there is no case for doing so. Suggested Action. 14. I would, therefore, suggest the following conclusions for my colleagues’ consideration ;— (1) That we should decide not to give the assurance suggested by the Government of India in view of the absence of any necessity for it and the weighty reasons against it. (2) That we should deal with the Afghan Government’s requests of 12th October last in the following manner. It will be observed that in our Minister’s opinion, while there is no real danger of an Afghan commitment to Russia, it is desirable to consider these requests favourably, in order to ensure a continuance of the Afghans’ present policy of co-operation with us in controlling the tribes on the Indian frontier. He thinks that the action suggested in paragraph 3 (a) and (6) of our telegram of 1st March Avould be adequate for this purpose. I feel strongly that, both for the limited purpose which he has in view and on wider grounds of policy, we should adopt his recommendation and instruct him as follows. He should agree to the request for the sale of munitions if the Government of India, on receiving information as to the Afghan requirements and method of payment, agree to this sale (and I have no reason to doubt that it will be possible to persuade them) and are able to supply them. As regards the other request, he should at once take the step, which he has advocated and to which the Government of India have agreed, to ascertain in a friendly talk with the Afghan Prime Minister what he hail in mind in suggesting consultation with our General Staff in connection with the defence of the northern road. He should be instructed that, if it then appears (as the request, taken at its face value, seems to suggest) that the Afghan Govern ment are seeking advice on the question of defending the northern road with their own resources, he should promise the military consultation which thev desire ; but that if it appears that the Afghan request was designed to draw us into a military commitment, he should confine himself to a confirmation of the assurances which we have already given. If the Afghan Prime Minister were not satisfied with this confirmation, Sir R. Maconachie would report for further instructions. India Office, S. H. 9th March 1934.7 ANNEX A. Enquiries received from Afghan Government, and Replies given in 1931 and 1932. I. On 22nd April 1931 the Afghan Foreign Minister enquired what the attitude .of His Majesty’s Government and of the Government of India would be in the event 'of war between Russia and Afghanistan. He asked whether, in the event of unprovoked aggression by the Soviet, Afghanistan could count on any kind of support from His Majesty’s Government, and stated that, without knowledge of the answer to this question, the foreign policy of his Government must remain fluid and opportunist, necessitating an attitude of surrender towards any demand which the Soviet Government might make and press home. After careful consideration of the matter by the Ministers concerned (Mr. Henderson and Mr. Benn), Sir R. Maconachie on 30th July 1931 gave a reply, the main substance of which was that, since British interests include the maintenance of a strong, independent and friendly Afghanistan, His Majesty’s Government naturally could not regard with indifference unprovoked aggression by a foreign Power against a friendly Afghanistan, but that the exact steps to be taken in that event must depend upon the circumstances of the moment. The reply also included an explanation of the relevant provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations. The Afghan Govern ment expressed no dissatisfaction with this reply. The Afghan Foreign Minister said that even if it was not all that his Government could desire, it was, he thought, all that they could reasonably expect. II. On 29th March 1932 the Afghan Prime Minister and Foreign Minister enumerated the demands which were then being pressed by the Soviet. They included, besides many others :— (i) Renewal of the agreement, which had been granted by Amanullah, but has since lapsed, providing for a Russian air service between Termez and Kabul. (ii) Discussion of a project for a through air mail service from Russia through Afghanistan to India. (iii) The conclusion of a commercial treaty, involving a system of State exchange of goods and extra-territorial rights for Soviet trade officials and premises. The Afghan Foreign Minister stated that this meant a network of spies and propagandists all over Afghanistan up to the Indian border. The Afghan Ministers stated that the Afghan Government had hitherto rejected or evaded these demands, but were in doubt whether they could continue this attitude indefinitely and what they were to do if the Soviet applied pressure to obtain the commercial treaty. In conclusion, they asked for information to enable them to appreciate their own position and that of neighbouring Governments, viz.: — (1) What was the political situation in Russia, and, in particular, were the Soviet in a position to attack A fghanistan ? (2) If the Soviet attacked Afghanistan, what would be the attitude of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, or the League of Nations ? They stated that these questions were vital and urgent, since on the answers to them would depend the attitude of the Afghan Government towards the Soviet in future and the possibility of their maintaining their present relations, as they sincerely desired to do, with His Majesty’s Government. After consideration by the Cabinet, Sir R. Maconachie was instructed in the Despatch of 17th October 1932 to inform the Afghan Government as follows :— (1) In the considered opinion of His Majesty’s Government there is no immediate danger of the Soviet attacking Afghanistan or applying forcible pressure. (The reasons for this opinion were elaborated in a memorandum given to Sir R. Maconachie for his use in conversation with the Afghan Government.) (2) (a) The replies which His Majesty’s Government were in a position to give were not to be regarded as necessarily holding good for all time and in all circumstances; they held good only in existing conditions, or so long as conditions so far as this country, Afghanistan and Russia are concerned remain materially the same as at present. (6) Subject to the above general caveat, if the Soviet attacked Afghanistan, this would be regarded by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom8 and the Government of India as an attack on British and Indian interests^ and would force them to take the steps normally taken by the Government of a State when its interests are seriously threatened. The immediate step to be taken would clearly be diplomatic intervention, which might be followed if necessary by pressure in the sphere of economic relations. (c) A suggestion was incidentally added that Afghanistan’s position would be A strengthened by entry into the League of Nations, but this was accompanied by the statement that His Majesty’s Government would always regard themselves as the Power primarily interested in the maintenance of her independence by Afghanistan. (d) It was also stated that in the event of a serious invasion of Afghan territory by Russia, and provided that such Russian action were clearly unprovoked by any action on the part of the Afghan Government, His Majesty’s Govern ment would be prepared, if their previous diplomatic intervention had failed, to break off diplomatic and official commercial relations with the Soviet Government, but that this was the furthest length to which His Majesty’s Government were prepared to go towards defining their attitude in advance, and the question whether any further action could be taken, if and when the case arose, would depend entirely upon circumstances at the time. Sir R. Maconachie made these communications to the Afghan Prime Minister and Foreign Minister on 1st and 14th December 1932. They were well received, particularly the first sentence of 2 (b) above. III. On 12th October 1933 the Afghan Prime Minister said that the Afghan Government— (i) wished to consult the British General Staff in connection with the defence of the northern road ; (ii) needed arms, ammunition and aircraft on payment by instalments. These are the two requests which are awaiting reply. ANNEX B. Telegram from Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty's Minister^ Kabul, dated ]st March 1934. 18. My telegram 22nd February, No. 15. His Majesty’s Government have under urgent consideration whether if 1927 policy were reaffirmed they should promise Afghan Government military support against Russian aggression. 2. It would be of great assistance to them if you could telegraph full information on following points :— (a) Recent general trend of Afghan policy as between this country and Russia. (b) Effect of decision of 1932, in the light of your experience since that date, on attitude and policy of Afghan Government. 3. Besides above information, please also telegraph your views on following •questions on the basis of your replies to above questions :— Does attitude of Afghan Government indicate, in your opinion, any risk at present or in near future of their being intimidated by the Soviet Government into adoption of a pro-Russian policy ? If so, is such risk so great that nothing less than the further assurance proposed by the Government of India in their Despatch No. 1 of 4th January would guard us against it ? Or would it suffice (a) to promise sale of arms and military conversations about northern road, with a view to advising Afghan Government as to best method of defending it with their own resources, and (b) to repeat previous assurances if it should appear in the course of the conversations that Afghans are angling for a promise of military support ? 4. We should be grateful if you could telegraph by 5th March self-contained and self-explanatory appreciation covering the above points which can be circulated as it stands in time for consideration on 7th March.9 Telegram from His Britannic Majesty' 1 s Minister at Kabul to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, dated 3rd March 1934. Forminka 18. 2. Tenour of my instructions has obliged me to avoid such conversations with Afghan Ministers as would give them opening for pressing their requests regarding •military advice by General Staff and supply of arms on payment. Consequently, I have been unable lately to discuss with them policy of their Government towards Russia, and my replies to your enquiries regarding recent developments must, therefore, consist mainly of inferences from such facts as have been ascertained. 3. Ttecent general trend of Afghan policy as between United Kingdom and Russia (your paragraph No. 2 (a)). (а) There has been no indication that Afghan Government have modified the conviction, which formed basis of their foreign policy, that Russia aimed at penetration of India through Afghanistan, and that therefore British and Afghan interests are essentially identical, viz. defensive as against offensive policy of Soviet Government. (б) Afghan Prime Minister lias more than once based his objections to coercive action by Government of India against tribes of North-West Frontier on alleged tendency of such action to prejudice solidarity of (i) India, (ii) frontier tribes, (iii) Afghanistan, in resistance to Soviet attack, which he regards as surely coming. Inference is that he tends to regard British support against Russian aggression as in fact assured to Afghanistan by force of circumstances apart from any declaration of policy by His Majesty’s Government. (c) But although their convictions on the broad issues remain unshaken, Afghan Government are occasionally compelled by the weakness of their position to meet immediate dangers by action which prejudices what they know to be their ultimate interests. 4. Question then is whether they have recently taken action of this kind in (i) military, (ii) political, (iii) economic spheres. 5. (i) Military. — (a) Either by acceptance of gifts or by purchase they have adopted British • 303 rifle as standard armament. (b) In October last they made purchase of ammunition from Imperial Chemicals. (c) They sent their air officers by invitation to see demonstrations by Royal Air Force, India, and have subsequently requested advice of latter regarding types of aircraft suitable for Afghanistan. (d) They have constructed road through the Hindu Kush to northern provinces in order to establish their own control of that area, not in order to link up with Russian system of communications. In fact, mere suggestion of latter possibility by Soviet Military Attache resulted immediately in their requesting advice of British General Staff regarding defence of this road against possible Russian aggression. 6. On the other hand, they have, whether seriously or otherwise, enquired the price at which Soviet Government would supply them with artillery. 7. (ii) Political. — (a) Government of Nadir Shah within the period of four years concluded or ratified treaties with Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland (i.e. in Foreign Minister’s words, “little Powers threatened by Russia”) and with Japan, which they regard as inveterate enemy of Russia. (b) All four local leaders of the Sikh Ghadr party, whom the Afghan Government describe as most dangerous Soviet agents, have been arrested and imprisoned. (c) In September last they executed Muhammad Wall, on whose behalf, when he was tried for sedition in 1929, Soviet Embassy had made representations. It was common knowledge here that this man was the favourite of the Soviet Embassy. (d) They claim to have definite evidence to prove that the Soviet authorities were concerned in seditious activities of Ghulam Nabi, who was executed in November 1932, and in intrigues of Amanulla as shown by letter from the latter to Ghulam Nabi, of which, at the request of the Afghan Government, 1 transmitted translation to you.10 (e) They frequently inform me of alleged Soviet intrigues affecting India and have even passed on to me photograph, given them by Soviet informant, of supposed British Secret Service Agent. (/) They restrict intercourse of Soviet Consuls with all strangers ; e.g., Goldman, recently here, told me that he was unable to call on Soviet Consul at Herat without Afghan Governor’s permission, and Italian engineer was recently^ sent away under arrest from Mazar-i-Sharif for being too friendly with Soviet Consulate there. 8. On the other hand— (a:) They signed Eight-Power Convention regarding Deiinition of Aggressor with the Soviet Government. Foreign Minister explained this as in accordance with policy of accepting, while not trusting, any pacific assurance offered by Russia. (y) Although they undertook to close down Russian air service, Termez-Kabul, as soon as new northern road was opened, this service still continues. Foreign Minister has reiterated undertaking, but said that condition of the road would not at present justify closure of the air service. This statement is confirmed by independent information. (z) Afghan Government favour and employ one, Maulvi Bashir, who, according to our intelligence, is dangerous Soviet agent. Afghan Government admit their own attitude towards this man, but absolutely deny correctness of our information regarding his character. 9. —(iii) Economic : — (a) They have definitely refused Soviet demand for Commercial Treaty, but offered exchange of goods on basis of barter through State agencies on either side so as to prevent political penetration of country by communist agents in guise of local representatives of Soviet organisations. Soviet Embassy at first refused, but later accepted this. \b) Last January they concluded agreement with Burma-Shell for future supply of petroleum products from British India. (c) Last autumn they negotiated sale of quantity of Persian lamb to British firm and agreement for large annual sales to this firm in future. Agreement fell through owing to attitude, not of Afghan Government, but of British firm. (d) They have accepted proposal that trade delegation from India should visit Kabul to explore possibility of mutual expansion of British Indian and Afghan trade. (e) They have purchased two wireless installations for Kabul and Herat from British Marconi’s and contemplate placing further orders with the same firm. 10. On the other hand— (x) They have admitted mission of Russian experts for destruction of locusts in northern Provinces. Mission is reported to consist exclusively of members of Communist Party and to be politically active. Although local Afghan Governor was reported to have recommended that numbers of mission should be drastically reduced this has not apparently been done. (y) They recently concluded agreement with Soviet organisation for exchange of Persian lamb from Afghanistan for Russian sugar and petrol in accordance with (iii) (a) above. (This agreement is now reported to have been suspended for reasons not yet definitely ascertained.) H i^fy conclusion is that on the facts known to us there is no indication that the Afghan Government have departed from original policy of preserving and strengthening British connection and, at the same time, humouring Russia (whom they look on as real enemy) with concessions in what they regard as unessentials. They are however, greatly impressed by constitutional developments in India as indicating impending abdication of His Majesty’s Government, as well as by Japan’s firmness ^of purpose and growing strength. Consequently they look on Japan as rlAQtinpd successor to His Majesty’s Government, both m control of India and as supporter of Afghanistan against Russian aggression. 12 Effect of decision of 1932 on attitude and 'policy of Afghan Goverrment (your paragraph 2 (&amp;)).—! have no definite evidence. Decision was well received at11 the time and, since it was communicated to them, Afghan Government have not asked for it to be modified. Their general policy as outlined above was laid down by Nadir Shah in 1930, and how far decision of 1932 has contributed to their adherence to it must be matter of speculation (arrangements for exchange of goods cm basis of barter, paragraph 9 (iiij (a) above, accord very closely with advice given fP' His Majesty’s Government through me in 1932). 13. Risk of Afghan Government being intimidated by Soviet Government at present, or in near future, into adoption of pro-Russian policy and measures proposed for preventing developments of this kind (your paragraph 3).—In existing conditions, viz., with present Prime Minister in power, no internal disturbance in Afghanistan, and Soviet Government apparently not prepared to threaten military pressure, I do not think there is serious risk of this kind. Afghan Government seem, at present, to regard any protests of Soviet Government with comparative equanimity owing to supposed preoccupation of latter with Far-eastern situation. 14. Position would be radically altered if :— (i) Prime Minister disappeared, with disturbances throughout the country and marked weakening of Afghan Government as result. Such developments seem quite possible at any moment, and Soviet Government might then be able to enforce modification of present Afghan policy to almost any extent by silent threat of subversive intrigue in northern Provinces. (ii) Policy and circumstances of Soviet Government changed, in such a way as to lead them to employ military measures to achieve their objectives in Afghanistan. 15. In the event of (i) above, I do not see that any assurance of support by His Majesty’s Government would be likely to restore the situation, since the real danger would arise from collapse of central Afghan Government, and in the event of (ii) occasion would appear to be one for action rather than assurances. 1G. In the existing circumstances, therefore, and such conditions as I can foresee as probable in the near future, it does not seem that either assurance proposed by Government of India or alternative mentioned in your paragraph 3 {a) and (b) would be necessary for purposes of preventing the adoption by the Afghan Government of pro-Russian polic 3 T . 17. Real danger at present seems to me that unless His Majesty s Government show themselves ready to give favourable consideration to Afghan enquiries regarding military advice and supplying of arms, Afghan Government may register their disgust by discontinuance of the present policy of co-operation on the Indian frontier. Alternatives in paragraph 3 (a) and (b) of your telegram should, however, in my opinion be sufficient to obviate this danger.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002da_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2191</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002da</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2191</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 7/23 'Afghanistan: sale of 5000 rifles with 3 million rounds of ammunition to the Afghan Government by the Government of India, 1935'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1934/1938</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-09-27T22:52:26</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (338 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in rough chronological order from the rear to the front of the file</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 339; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence and minutes regarding requests by the Afghan Government for arms, ammunition and aircraft to be supplied by either the British or Indian Governments.
