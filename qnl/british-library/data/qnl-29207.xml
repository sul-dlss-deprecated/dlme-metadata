Dear Baggallay, Would you please refer to Foreign Office Official letter No. E. 4668/4668/65 of the 3rd September and your demi-official letter of the same date regarding a proposed round Arabia flight by Hassan Anis Pasha ? 2. Our policy for some years past has been to discourage flights by Civil aviators along the Arab shores of the Persian Gulf and in the case of Bahrein (see enclosure to India Office Printed letter No. P.Z.4874/33 of the 12th August 1933) and Kov/eit (see enclosure to India Office Printed Letter No. P.Z.8320/33 of the 29th December 1933) the respective Rulers have stated in writing that they do not wish permission to be granted to private aviators to fly over or land in their iterritories. More recently an effort was made to induce the Sultan of Muscat to give His Majesty’s Government specific authority to refuse applications from private aviators to fly over or land in his Arabian territories but as you will see from H.

Nevertheless it is fairly certain that His Highness would in most cases reject applications for private flights over his territories. 3. In the light of the foregoing we suggest that the Embassy should’be asked to inform the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in general terms, that owing to the unwillingness of the Rulers concerned to allow private fliers to land in their territories, permission cannot be accorded for the flight over that part of Anis Pasha's route which lies along the Persian Gulf. If, however, you think that it would be advisable to have the Sultan of Muscat’s specific refusal we should be quite willing to ask the local political authorities to approach His Highness accordingly. 4* Copies of this letter are being sent to the Colonial Office and Air Ministry.

Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to enclose copies of the marginally noted papers relative to a projected flight by Miss Earhart, an American, including India and Arabia. I am to request that Lord Zetland may be informed whether the Government of India have any objection to the proposed flight across India and whether they wish to lay down any conditions as to the route to be follov/ed across Burma and India, in view of the fact that the precise route which Miss Earhart proposes to follow over these territories is not specified in the American Ambassador’s Note. As regards proposal to fly from Karachi to Aden, this will presumably involve crossing the Arabian territories of Muscat. If you and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (to whom a copy of these papers is being sent) agree, I propose to suggest that U.S. Ambassador should be informed that no flights over the Arabian territories of Muscat are permitted without special authorisation from the Sultan and ||| that there is no hope of permission being obtained from His Highness at the present time for private flights in this aree In view of the fact that so far as I am aware the Sultan (unlike the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit) has not actually requested His Majesty’s Government to refuse any application for private flights over his Arabian territories, the Resident will no doubt consider the advisability of approaching His Highness with reference to the present case (if he is back in his capital) and obtaining specific authority for such refusals.

Memorandum No. 597-3 of 193/ Bus hire, the 7th August, 1937* Subject : Proposal to obtain specific authority from the Sultan of Muscat for the refusal of applications for private flights over his Arabian territory. Reference paragraph 3 of Foreign and Political Express Letter No. F.290-N/37&gt; dated the 26th January 1937* 2 As I was unable to take up this question with the Sultan during my visit to Muscat in April, there were many other matters for discussion, I instructed Major Watts to approach His Highness. I now enclose a copy of a letter No. R.34» dated the 23rd July 1937&gt; from Major Batts, from ,; which it will be seen that His Highness is not prepared to w delegate to His Majesty’s Government the authority sought. |1 3- Applications for flights over the Arabian territories of His Highness are not likely to be many. His Highness has stated (paragraph 3 of Major Batts' letter) that he would in most cases reject such applications. Moreover, in any particular case that may arise, the emphasizing/emphasizing to His Highness of the fact that the responsibility for the results of according permission lies on him, and of the difficulties that he would be put to in the case of a forced landing in an inaccessible area, or of death or injury to aviators at the hands of wild tribesmen would, I think, be effective in prevailing on him to refuse permission. 7/hen, therex ore, His Highness is in Muscat and can be referred to without delay no difficulty is likely to arise. .Then His Highness is not easily accessible, e.g. when he is at Dhofar? applicants could be informed that reference to His Highness will take considerable time, and as aviators generally do not apply much before the proposed date of their flight, the delay involved in the reference to His Highness should act as a strong deterrent. In view of the foregoing considerations and of the Sultan's feelings in the matter I suggest that no further attempt should be made to induce the Sultan to change his mind, and that the proposal should be dropped. sd.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your memorandum No. 350-S dated May the 17th 1937 on the subject of obtaining authority from the Sultan for refusal of permission for private civil flights over the Arabian territories of Muscat and Oman. 2. I discussed this matter at some length with His Highness and raised all the points mentioned in your letter quoted above but could not succeed in persuading him to agree to give the required authority to His Majesty’s Government. 3* The Sultan declared that while he realized the inadvisability of allowing private civil aviators to fly down the Arab coast, and so far as Muscat territories were concerned he would in most cases reject all such applications, he was unwilling to delegate altogether his authority to refuse permission to all and sundry as he felt that in the case of those nations with whom he had Treaties, i.e. the United States, Prance and the Dutch Netherlands such an act would be likely to be considered unfriendly especially/especially as no request for such refusal had presumably been made by the Governments of those three countries. The Sultan stated that he would be willing to authorize His Majesty's Government to refuse permission for private civil flights over his Arabian territories for the subjects of all countries other than those three mentioned in the preceding paragraph but I said that I did not thinh such an arrangement v/ould be suitable. 5* Under the circumstances if His Majesty's Government consider the matter important I see no other course but to make another attempt to persuade the Sultan to issue the authority asked for when he returns from his visit to Bagdad and the Gulf about the end of September.

This in itself is hardly perhaps, a reason for refusing him facilities which would be accorded to any other private applicant. But if we could legitimately withhold the desired permission on some ground of general application we should not be sorry. 3. I am sending a similar letter to Cowell, and a copy to the Air Ministry.

British Embassy Alexandria. Air Mail 3rd October, 1938. Dear Kelly, Our despatch No.978 of August 20th, about the proposed Ilight of Hassan Anis Pasha over Arabia. I enclose a translation of an interview which Hassan Anis gave to the paper f, Al Mokattam' . This is interesting in view of the friendly manner in which Hassan Anis approached the PuOyal Air Force about his flight (our despatch No.933 of 8th August). We have lately had further information confirming the connection of Hassan Anis and Abbas Halim with the German propagandist organisation. There has also been evidence of some slig;ht connection between the National Flying Corporation and Ahmed Hussein and his green shirts, though this is said to be solely due to a common interest in aviation and not to any political sympathy. Yours ever (Sgd.) C.H. Batemen D.V. Kelly, Esq., C.M.G., M.C., E gyp t i an D e pa r tme nt, Foreign Office, London, S.W.l.Ai Mokqttam, 1st September. In conversation with r. representative of the 'Moknttam' regarding his fli ght to A rah countries, Has Scan Anis Pasha began by referring to the interest taken by him in aviation which went back to 1912 when Fedrin, the famous French aviator, paid a visit to Egypt. Anis Pasha said that after leaving his post as Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs he drafted a scheme for the establishment of an air route for the transport of mail and passengers between Trieste and Alexandria via Athens. Anis Pasha added that he proceeded to England in 1925 in order to negotiate with the competent authorities about the execution of that important scheme and also to study the project for the establishment of an aviation company in Egypt, but the English created such difficulties in his way that he had to leave England for Europe. After a long trip on the Continent, he returned to Cairo in one of the German aeroplanes. An open campaign was then raised by the British newspapers against his scheme. As regards his visit to Arab countries Anis Pasha v/ent on to say that he v/ished to realize Arab Union through aviation, especially as King Farouk himself set the good example of the close relationship, which should prevail among Eastern countries, through the marriage of Princess Fawzia to the Crown Prince of Iran. It is for this reason, continued Hassan Anis Pasha, that he intended to land in every Arab country with the exception of the Yemen, which did not grant him permission to do so. He would stay a v/eek in every country, during which he would deliver speeches and lecture on aviation, thus realizing Arab Union through this factor. His trip v/ould take two months and the distance proposed to be traversed would approximately be 7,500 kilometres. By doing so Anis Pasha said he would spread aviation in Arabic speaking countries thus encouraging Arab/2 . Arab aviators to exchange visits with their Arab colleagues. . Anis Pasha expressed his surprise at the failure of Egypt to join the 1919 Agreement for Internatioral aerial navigation ? seeing that efforts had been made since 1926 for that purpose. He also referred to a question which was raised in Parliament by Abdel Rahman Azzam as to why Egypt did not join that agreement, although the Permananent Committee for the Agreement invited the Egyptian Government to join it soon after the proclamation of the 1922 Declaration. 'The Government, however, evaded answering that question. The real reason for this was, continued Anis Pasha, that Lord Lloyd warned the Egyptian Government to prevent aviation in Egypt, subsequent to the efforts made by Anis Pasha for the establishment of an Egyptian air route and the propaganda he had been organising for his trip to Europe during 1925. Anis Pasha remarked that since Egypt had not joined that Agreement, every Egyptian aviator was bound to obtain permission for landing in the country he wished to visit, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a process v/hich caused unnecessary delay and loss of t ime. Anis Pasha concluded by saying that he intended to visit those Arab countries in his personal capacity and not as Vice- President of the National Aviation Association./ P.Z. 6889/38. K.6600/5! 00/25.

These cards contain description and photograph of the bearer signed and stamped by Permit Officer of the British Forces in the Middle East. Object of issue to Pan American personnel is to ensure freedom from delay in obtaining visas etc. Pan American representative at Khartoum has now asked that these cards may be recognised in lieu of any other identification papers on our territories en route between Egypt and Burma. They are not at present operating regularly on this route but may do so at any moment and I presume that individual aircraft may be coming through before regular operation. 2.

In 1933 the Shaikh of Bahrain specifically objected to private aircraft landing at Bahrain ride your letter No. C/292-21/20 dated the 24th July 1933* If you see no objection would you kindly endeavour now to obtain his agreement to private aircraft flying over and landing in Bahrain territory on the condition that normal pasyport and visa requirements are maintained. If you consider it necessary it may be pointed out to him that in view of the reliability and range of modern light aircraft it is no longer considered necessary to forbid the use of the Arab air route by private aircraft. Uo! 2. So far as the Trucial Shaikhdoms are concerned they have already authorised H.M.G. to accord rights to foreign aircraft, vide enclosures to your Printed Letters Hos.C/365 and C/406 dated the 6th and 17th April 1946 respectively, and I am inclined to think it may be taken for granted that they have no objection to similar rights being accorded to private aircraft whether British or foreign.
