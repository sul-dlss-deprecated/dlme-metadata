Motes by Vice-Consul Chick on a Visit to the Khan of Hayat Daoud. I LEFT Bushire on the 24th November by sea to Shief, intending to proceed by a roundabout route to Behbehan. The objects which I had in view were 1 To obtain as accurate information as possible of the amount of land under grain cultivation in the district that lies between the borders of Arabistan and Bushire, and the amount of grain available for export in ordinary years. _ 2 . To gather useful information regarding the districts under the jurisdiction ol the various ruling khans. ^ i 3 'Pq examine the importance of Behbehan as a market for imports and exports, the town itself being little known to Europeans. I had, however, only reached Bunder Pig before I was recalled to Bushire, owing to the attack on M. Passek, and Shiraz reports as to the restlessness of tribes to the east of Behbehan, but I hope to complete the tour in the spring. I spent a week in the districts of Angali, Pudhilleh, and Hayat Daoud, and was received everywhere with the greatest hospitality and friendship by the khans. The position of the Khan of Hayat Daoud especially and his personality appear to me of considerable interest to the British Government in the present state of Southern Persia. Influence of Haidar Khan of Hayat Daoud. —The territorial influence of Haidar Khan may be said to cover the coast district extending from Shief 9 miles north of Bushire to the port of Dilam, 100 miles approximately from Bushire, and from Dilam north of the Lirawi district along the Behbehan road to near Zeidun, thence to the mountains about 14 miles from the sea. I do not yet know how far the Lirawi district extends to the other side of the mountains, but Hayat Daoud territory has its eastern border some 15 miles across the range (where it meets the Kashguli branch of the Kashgai tribe). The eastern border of the coast district extends from Lirawi down to Shahbancara and Zireh, a distance of about 85 miles. The south-eastern border of Shahbancara to Shief is roughly 38 miles in length. This large stretch of land—not less than 3,000 square miles—is divided into several districts:— Under Haidar Khan and his relatives. Hayat Daoud and Pig Pudhilleh Genawa Bunder Dilam Shahbancara, and Zireh 1 Which are independent of the Khan of Hayat Lirawi h Daoud and each other, but yet look up to J him as their guiding spirit. Angali United these ruling khans compromise the most important hegemony situated between the Arab tribes, subjected to the Sheikh of Mohammeiah and Baluchistan. They hold no title from the Persian Government, though nominally their districts fall under the provincial governments of either the Gulf ports or Ears ; in point of fact neithey government can interfere to any extent in their internal affairs, the “ maliyat is nominal and^ often unpaid, and the Customs surveillance of the coast ineffective, ihey rule by tribal government. Haidar Phan of Hayat Daoud is evidently tbe most important of these: his ai1 ? 1 ^ nave een 01 years in possession of that part of the coast district, and I append a short genealogy.Morad Khan (Hayat Daoud). Hosein Khan. Murad Khan (killed in fight Lira vis). Khan Ali Khan (of Hayat Daoud). Murad Khan (of De Lam). Haidar Khan (Hayat Daoud), 40 years. Hosein Quli (of Rudhilleh), 35 years. Mohammed Khan (of Charusi), 38 years. Hussein Khan (Dilam). Allah Keram Daughter Khan. (married Ahmed Khan, of Genawa). Khan Ali Daughter Khan. (married to Allah Keram Khan). Abdul Hussan Ahmed Khan. Khan (Genawa). As regards the influence of Haidar Khan over the surrounding districts :— 1. Between Genawa and Dilam comes the fertile Lirawi territory under Haii Hassan Khan who, shortly before my arrival at Bunder Rig, had picked a quarrel with the tribes living round Zeitun under the leadership of Eimur Agha. the Ak Ghehre and Jugatain : and during my stay news arrived of the killing of Sheikh Kazim of the Lirawis by his opponents. Both sides were appealing to Haidar Khan to settle the dispute. The letter of safe-conduct, which the khan gave me for the Khan of* Lirawi (his brother-in-law) was ,distinctly of the nature of an order. 2. Ismail Khan, of Shahbancara, a large district adjoining Hayat Daoud to the south-east also appealed to Haidar Khan to settle a quarrel which he had with the important Kashguli branch of the Kashgai tribe. On the other hand, a few days previously Mohammed Hassan Khan of the Kashgulis had sent twenty-five horsemen all the way across the mountains to Bunder Rig, with a letter asking the good offices of Haidar Khan in the same affair. (N.B.—Mohammed Hassan Kashguli had purchased last year from the Persian Government the lease of the district of Mazara for 6,000 tomans: a certain Seyyid Jaafer of that district, late deputy for Shiraz in the Medjliss, afterwards misrepresented to the Government that the district belonged to him, and made over the lease to the Khan of Shahbancara in return for his help. The Kashguli chief justly demands that either his 6,000 tomans should be returned, or the district handed over to him). 3. Haidar Khan is in constant correspondence with the Kashgai chiefs. The armed force at the disposal of Haidar Khan comprises, as far as I could ascertain, in normal times: Hayat Daoud, 1,500-2,000 tufangchis; Rudhilleh, 700 tufangchis; besides the contingents from Genawa and Lirawi, the numbers of which I do not yet know. Since the death of Haidar Khan’s father, sixteen years ago, the influence of the Khan of Hayat Daoud has undoubtedly grown. The present chief is a very pleasantly- spoken, quiet man, much liked by his tribesmen for piety and justice. In boyhood he and his brother Mohammed Khan were retained as hostages by the then governor of the Gulf ports, and were brought up with the residency dragomans. Both he and his brothers still mistrust the Persian Government so much that they will not venture out of their territory. That, however, did not prevent him acceding to the request of the Derya Begi in May 1909 when he dispatched over 400 armed men to Bushire to enable him to make his expedition to Tangistan. Relations of Haidar with British. —His relations with the residency have been very friendly for years, and the courageous personal assistance which he gave the resident and His Majesty’s ship “Highflyer” in arresting pirates at Genawa in 1908 will be remembered. It seems not improbable that his policy is to gain the favour and goodwill of the British authorities in order to consolidate his own position in time of need. His friendship is worth cultivating. He is the owner of Kharg (Garrick) Island. No railway passing from the direction of Arabistan towards the south to Bushire, or behind it, could avoid passing through Hayat Daoud territory. His Views. —Like all the other ruling khans of these parts, he seems to take a gloomy view of the prospects of the Persian Government being able to recover any administrative power over the outlying and tribal districts of Pars. I am not at all sure that these khans would not be altogether displeased if this prove the case, [2668 g— b] B 2provided that they axe able to ^ ^ left to manage their triba a air ^ ^ ^ v;ewg on the p r e Se nt slate of affairs in He was very frank g ^ wag much interested in the rising of Southern Persia, and they are me out from a letter received from Ismail Khai£ Kahim Khan in the north, and ead me out f-ma ^ eventg at of Shahbancara containing chiefs evidently had a poor opinion of the prospects KSSST SS Kh.“d' Z Medjliss l,.dL “ .Ud. ■ in ta, SC/StilS! ~d. I— Kmn, in . most stress was the mistrust by the southern tribes of the bardar Assad as Minister ot the Interior, and their irre/onciliation to anything which seemed to threaten a B&amp;k Accor P dhf toX'darKharthe Lur and Kashgai tribes with which he is con nected thouglft that Sardar Assad wished to institute a Bakhtian sovereignty They saw Neief Kuli Khan, Minister of the Interior. The Samsam-es-oultaneh at Ispahan, Ilyas Khan appointed to Behbehan (which is Kubgelu country, and for long under he Fars Government), one Bakhtiari sent to Yezd and another nominally as head of the military forces of Fakhr-ul-Mulk, governor of Arabistan, though really to institute a Bakhtiari surveillance over the Sardar Arfa. , , ((A He understood that two important personages had fathomed the deigns of the Sardad Assad, viz., Soulet-ed-Dowleh, likhani of the Kasbgais, and Sardar Arfa, sheikh of Mohammerah. n , , i V1 Soulet-ed-Dowleh has about 2,000,000 men under his command, and is treated like a king in his tribe ; he is really a greater chieftain than the Bakhtiari Khans, and did not relish one of them over him as Minister of the Interior. That was the position generally taken up by the Kashgai and L&lt;ur tribes, of which the Hayat Daoudis are an offshoot. The Lurs of Fars were continually making raids on the Bakhtiam, and, as regards the government of a Bakhtiari Khan in Behbehan over the overlordship o t e Sardar Assad as Minister of the Interior, they would not submit (tamkin nemikunand). Haidar Khan also stated that Soulet-ed-Dowleh had written to himself and to other khans, e.g., of Shahbancara representing his objections to the present regime. ^ There is considerable confirmation from other sources of the views thus assigned to the Soulet-ed-Dowleh and Sardar Arfa. Mr. Wilson is constantly referring to Sheikh Khazal’s misgivings as to the intentions of the Sardar Assad and Bakhtiari interference in Arabistan, evidently foreseeing future attacks on his own position. As to the Soulet-ed-Dowleh, it seems quite possible that the bottom of all the present raiding in Fars, and disagreement between the Governor-General and the likhani may be the latter’s dislike of the Sardar Assad occupying the position of Minister of the Interior. A Shirazi well connected with the Kashgai tribe has told us that^ the Soulet-ed-Dowleh in his correspondence will not give the usual titles of the Minister of the Interior to Sardar Assad. Mr. Christmas and his party on their way from Shiraz were stopped by a large force of Kashgais at Dashtarjin, and one of the chiefs asked Mr. Christmas much to his surprise whether he remembered the story of Charles II. “We are going to bring back Mohammed Ali Shah, just as they did Charles II. Mr. Bill, writing on the 1st December, thinks that the Soulet-ed-Dowleh is evidently determined to show his hostility to the present regime by all the means in his power. Lawless state of Kuhgelu country .'—Haidar Khan also gave me in the course of conversation details which show the wild and independent nature of the tribes north west of Shiraz. The Boir-Ahmedi tribe, which was alleged to have assaulted M. Passek has, for the last few years been most unruly. It numbers 7,000 riflemen at least, and they are cunning fighters (the Kughelu of whom they form a clan number more than 100,000, it was estimated). ^ Ihe former have kdled all their own prominent chiefs, this year Wali Khan and Shahin Khan, his son; last year Kerim Khan, Bahadur-ed-Dowleh with twenty-five men of the tribe who were escorting Zeigham-ed-Dowleh, ex-Ilkhani of the Kashgais on his way to Behbehan as governor. Zeigham was only released from impri sonment after great difficulty by Soulet-ed-Dowleh his brother. They live in small fortresses in the mountains east of Behbehan where they have supplies of provisions and water. J— _ The passes to their strongholds are inaccessible and it would cost the Governor of Shiraz a very large sum to capture even a few of them. Ti t2'r? mm A a Kuh g elu tribe, last year captured a cannon sent by the Behbehan ^Government in order to force them to pay “maliyat” and buried it The Persian ^omcials kept the matter quiet. The position m the Mamasenni district (a fief of the Moin-et-Tujjar, Shahbancara Brothers and Said-es-Sultaneh, late governor of the Gulf ports) can be little better. Dushman Zian Rustemi Bakkesh, and Jawidi are the four tribes concerned. They have paid no tribute for three years; m 1907 they looted Said-es-Sultaneh as he was returning irom Joushire. During my stay at Rig, Haidar Khan received news that an officer sent by the • ^ ais a cannon and soldiers to exact tribute had been attacked m Mamasenni and the cannon captured. » It would seem that the Persian Grovernment have before them a tremendous task, should they try to i educe the Kashgai, Kuhgelu and coast districts to order.

Assurance contained in sentence indicated will be welcome to sheikh on general grounds, but as long as Sardar Assad remains Minister of Interior it will not dispose of present difficulty unless words ‘ or Bakhtiari tribe ’ could be interpolated after words ‘ Persian Government.’ In this connection, please see paragraphs 7, 8, and 9 of Trevor’s telegram No. 170. “ I quite realise, however, that in matter of retirement of Sardar Assad the interests of north and south conflict, and some compromise is necessary. A change of portfolio might improve situation, though it would not fully appease. “ It would of course be very difficult, as well as inconsistent with the principles of our policy, for us to guarantee Arabistan against aggression of Bakhtiari tribe or guarantee Bakhtiari against Kashgai, but, presuming that we cannot intervene in inter tribal politics, can we reasonably persevere in forcing advice on the sheikh against the consequences of which we are unable to protect him ? “ He is quite alive to necessity for maintaining strictly constitutional and loyal attitude to central Government, and also to the need of avoiding action calculated to complicate situation in Northern Persia. “ Wilson understands from Haji Rais that first result of any arrangement come to between three parties under reference would be diplomatic telegram to Medjliss expressing complete individual and collective loyalty to constitution and ability and intention to maintain order and protect trade in their respective spheres, but at the same time urging the imprudence of placing the control of national affairs in the hands of tribal heads, who cannot be expected to refrain from using their position to pursue tribal aims. “ (Addressed to Tehran ; repeated to India.) ” I am instructing His Majesty’s consul at Mohammerah to give sheikh message indicated in my telegram No. 152, and I do not see why we need go further in our assurances. From resident’s telegrams it would seem that if Sardar Assad were to leave Government he would have no further terrors for sheikh. The assurance we are now giving latter surely applies to Sardar Assad so soon as he is in the Government. I have no desire to force on sheikh advice against the consequences of which we should be unable to protect him, but I see no harm in emphasising the fact that assurances depend on his loyalty to central Government.

As regards the question of protecting the sheikh from foreign aggression, I am to state that the proposal to substitute for the iorm of words suggested in my letter of the 31st ultimo that made use of in the agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Ameer of Afghanistan has received careful consideration in this department, in consultation with His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire. I am to state that the earlier formula was adopted, after long reflexion and exhaustive discussion of the question with Major Cox, because it appeared to be such as would convince the sheikh of the honest intention of His Majesty’s Government to do their best to safeguard him, as far as they possibly can, having regard to the state of local and general politics at the time, while not committing them in all circumstances to intervention by force of arms. Sheikh Khazal is, in Sir E. Grey’s belief, wmll aware that circumstances might arise in which it would be impracticable to give him effective help, and could easily be made to understand that the assurance, while constituting a pledge of the sincerity of the intention to afford him all the aid which His Majesty’s Government have it in their power to lend, is yet given with that qualification. Sir E. Grey is convinced that the form of words used in the agreement with the Ameer would fail to satisfy the sheikh, but, on the contrary, would rather tend to excite his apprehensions, and that, rather than offer it to him, it would be preferable to endeavour to avoid the question till it is again pressed by him. In view of the above considerations, in the cogency of which Major Cox entirely concurs, I am to express the hope that Lord Morley may see his way to withdraw the objections which he has raised to the adoption of the formula proposed in my letter above referred to. In order, however, to remove all possibility of misunderstanding on the sheikh’s part of the nature and scope of the assurances, Sir E. Grey would suggest that Major Cox should receive instructions, when communicating to his Excellency the assurances in writing, to convey to him at the same time a verbal intimation that, while His Majesty’s Government are perfectly sincere in their intentions towards him and have therefore given him these assurances, yet circumstances might arise in which it would be impossible for them to intervene by force on his behalf. In such a case he would, of course, receive the strongest diplomatic support. Major Cox would record in writing the substance of the conversation in the course of which this intimation was made to the sheikh. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET.

The form ' safeguard him to the best of our ability M seemed to Mr Mallet and myself to meet the case without committing us too much. In the formula used in the assurances given to the Amir there is nothing, I fear, which would satisfy the Sheikh of the bona fides of our intention to do the best we could do for him; and I strongly recommend that the India Office be pressed to accept the other form. I can think of nothing at present which would meet the case better.

He did not seem to be greatly perturbed at possibility of intervention in the south. “ ‘ Sheikh has promised to take no steps in the matter for the present. “ ‘ His attitude of resentment at the domination of the Bakhtiari, intensified by what has been going on at Behbehan, is shared, as far as I can judge, by his subjects. “ ‘ I believe sheikh to be genuinely in favour of the constitutional minority of the Bakhtiari.’ ” There is no doidot that the Bakhtiari ascendency is deeply resented in the south, and that its continuance will probably lead to trouble.&lt;A. f~ityldjLrrJ^ &amp; MINUTE. The original assurance given by Sir A .Hardinge to the Sheikh in December 1902 is as folloios Hajji Reis-ut-Tujjar asked me on your behalf to what extent you might rely on the protection of the British Government, and 1 told him that so long as you behaved to us as you have done in the past in a friendly manner, our influence would be exerted here to maintain you and your tribes in the enjoyment of your hereditary rights and customs, and to dissuade the Government of Tehran from any endeavour to diminish or interfere with them. Hajji Reis thereupon said that you were not afraid of the Persian Government itself nor of attack by neighbouring tribes acting or professing to act under its orders, but that you wished to know whether we should protect you in the event of an attempt by a foreign Power to depose you or deprive your people of the rights which they at present possess. This might happen in two ways : either such a foreign Power might be at war with Persia, and might as an enemy of the Shah send ships to attack your district. Or such a Power, pretending to be the friend of the Persian Government or to act on its behalf might attempt also by means of its ships to conquer you and the Arabs. 1 replied that both contingencies were extremely unlikely, but if either were to arise, we should, I believed, interfere, provided you had acted in accordance with our advice, and our fleet, which is the strongest of any in the Gulf, would be employed to prevent any forcible measures against you. I stated, however, that I would refer these questions to the Foreign Minister of the British Government, and he has now authorized me to say that we shall protect Mohammerah against naval attack by a foreign Power, whatever pretext for such action may be alleged, and also,''s(rTong as you remain faithful to the Shah and act in accordance' with our advice, shall continue to give you our good offices and support. eve This was repeated in December 1908 and tended as follows .*- l^pr\ (he £ fihg /o(j 1 am directed to repeat, on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, the assurances given to your Excellency in the letter of His Majesty’s Minister, Sir Arthur Hardinge, dated the 7th December, 1902, which is in your possession, and the terms of which I repeated to you at our interview above referred to; and I am then to add that His Majesty’s Government now extend those assurances to your successors. I am further to point out that His Majesty’s Government have engaged to respect the independence and integrity of Persia, and to explain that that undertaking involves the maintenance of the status quo in that country and includes the continuance of the state of autonomy which your Excellency at present enjoys. It follows from the above that any external aggression upon your Excellency would constitute an infringement of Persian integrity, which is recognized by the terms of the,ApgloRussian Convention., This was further extended in May 1 09 as follows:- While expressing your thanks for these amplified assurances, you represented that they seemed to you only to safeguard you so long as Persia continued to exist as a sovereign State and you pressed for a further assurance which would cover the contingency of Persia ceasing to exist as a sovereign State and the intervention or occupation by foreign Powers. You also expressed doubt as to whether the present assurance only provided immunity against unwarrantable encroachment on your rights by the absolute govern ment of His Majesty the Shah, or whether it also covered prevention of similar action on the part of parliamentary government. In reply to those representations, your Excellency was informed that Great Britain and Russia being pledged to respect the integrity of Persia, the British Government were not, properly speaking, able to admit even the possibility of Persia ceasing to be a sovereign State or coming under the occupation of a foreign Power, but that in the unlikely event of such a contingency the assurances already given to your Excellency would become even more binding than before. I was further permitted to inform you that whatever change might take place in the form of government in Persia the British Government were prepared to give you seio. i. 724. the same support against any encroachment on your rights as was promised to you in 1902, and I was authorised to add that they were now prepared to extend the application of those assurances to your “ heirs and successors.”V . ■\v\ Z- The Sheikh was not satisfied loith this , and on the motion of Major Cox ayvi Sir G.Barolay the F.O* now propose to modify the assurance further (1) by substituting 'm*l o descendants” for ”hei and successors”, on the condition that the Sheikh and they 'continue to fulfil their obligations to H.M.

He himself proposed the following Translation of Brief Form of Assurances of the nature desired by Sheikh Khazal, the terms dictated by him to Major Cox. (For communication to tribal elders.) r , J am authoriz ed to inform you that whatsoever change may take place in the state f the government of Persia, and whether it be Eoyalist or Nationalist, the British Government will be prepared to afford you support and protection for preventing any t of encroachment op your property, jurisdiction, and rights; and will likewise piotect you against foreign Powers, and not allow any encroachment to be made on yom property, jurisdiction, and rights. These assurances have been given for yourself and afterwards for your male descendents by the British Government.^ 7 and in 4-32: For this Sir G.Bare lay and Major Cox proposed to substitute : Revised Version of Assurance to Sheikh of Mohammerah. r I AM authorised to inform you that, no matter what change may take place m the form of the government of Persia, and, whether it he Boyahst or Nationalist, the British Government will be prepared to afford you the support necessary for obtaining a satisfactory solution in the event of any encroachment by the Persian Government on your iurisdiction and recognised rights or on your property m Persia. 7 T like manner they will afford you protection against molestation from foreign Powers, and will not permit any encroachment to be made by them on your said juris diction and recognized rights or upon your property in Persia. , , A These assurances are given for yourself by the British Government and are intended to extend to your male descendents so long as you or they sha no a\e failed to observe your obligations to the Central Government and shall have continued to be guided by our advice and maintain an attitude satisfactory to us. 7 The F.O. proposes to accept this with the following alterations (a)Hq (a) in para* l to the effect that in the event of encroachment hy the Persian Government on hie private property in Persia n H. I'.Government will afford him n aceistance to obtain a satisfactory solution of the rr diff iculty (b) in pa^a.£ to substitute Government will n safeguard you to the best of their ability against 'an unprovoked attack by a foreign, Power or against 'any encroachment by such a Power on your said 'jurisdiction and recognised rights or upon your 'property in Persia'. They also propose to give him a K.O.T.E., and, with regard to the Sheikh's apprehensions as to the effect on his position of possible British interven - tion in the south of Persia to inform him 'that the 'contingency is one which 11.P.Government cannot 'contemplate and to refer him to the instrument itself 'and to the communication made to him on December 1st '1908 in, which this guest ion is expressly dealt with'. The first proposal (1 ) so far introduces a new principle into our relations with Hohanmera that it extends the pledge from support of the de facto ruler to that of the de jure roller. But with the proviso proposed by the Foreign Off ice, vir. that he must he acceptable to the tribesmen, the de jure ruler will not be entitled to our support until he has become the de facto ruler. The assurance therefore amounts in practice to very little, and, it is submitted, may s afe ly be gin yen. The second proposal (£,) is more doubtful. The Fore ion Office profess to reaard it as setting a time \ limit f&lt;xt present limit to aft assurance that ia^of indefinite duration. The Sheihh evidently ^ega^de it ae ha^nnn rather the opposite effect. J r o one can foresee what will happen in even one generation, to say nothing of three, and it is submitted that it is very inconvenient to hind ourselves too tightly, ansi that this assurance should not he given. We may agree to the preparation of a document for the satisfaction of the tribesmen, and to the version (a) of air a. 13 relay 1 s vara. 1. proposed by the Foreign Office, which does not go beyond the assurances previously given. The proposal (b) as to para. p. requires consider ation. The distinction between attach by sea and attach by land is - except from the point of view of practical convenience - purely arbitrary. The safe guards proposed are (1) that v?e are to help him only 'to the best of our ability', (2) that he 'shall 'hare continued to be guided by our advice, and main- 'tain an attitude satisfactory to us'. (1) does rot seem quite strong enough, and it would perhaps be preferable to adopt the language of our agreement with the Amir, and say ' F. F. n ovt . will be prepared 'to aid you.to such extent and in sunh manner as may appear to them, desirable, in the event of an unpro- 'vohed attach, etc. ' and omit 'against any' before 'encroachment.

Barclay's despatch/appear to Sir E. Grey to be suffi ciently strong adequately to explain the Sheikh's anxiety on the point. Sir E. Grey sees no objection, in the circum stances, to compliance with the Sheikh's desire so long as it is made quite clear to him that the assur ances given are only to hold good on condition that he and his male descendants continue to fulfil their obligations to His Majesty’s and the Persian Govern ments and to be acceptable to their tribesmen. -r sir g. Grey attaches some importance to the in clusion of the latter condition since it would be un desirable that His Majesty's Government should find themselves in the position of being bound to support a Sheikh of Mohammera with whom the tribesmen were dis satisfied and whom they wished to remove. / xhe Sheikh further wishes the assurances to be made to hold good for one hundred years. As( 1006 / 10 ) &lt;oX^ / As regards this point Sir E. Grey has no objec tion in principle to making the assurances valid for a stated time since it appears preferable that His Maj esty's Government should be bound for a fixed period only than that they should remain under this obliga tion in perpetuity. He would suggest however that the period should be somewhat reduced and that the as surances should be given for three generations only. 5. The Sheikh also asks for an assurance of protec tion for his private property in Persia and, so far as possible encroachment by the Persian Government is concerned. Sir E. Grey concurs in the view of Sir G. Barclay and Major Cox that there is no objection to promising him that in such an event His Majesty's Government will afford him assistance to obtain a sat isfactory solution of the difficulty. /■; sir e. Grey further sees no harm in the proposal of Major Cox that, in order to give His Majesty's Gov- emnent a pretext for Intervention in a case of this kind, the Sheikh should be made a K.C.I.E. The( 1006 / 10 ) /o * The question however of giving an assurance that the Sheikh shall he protected against molestation by foreign Powers or against any encroachment by such a Power on his jurisdiction, recognized rights or prop erty in Persia requires more careful consideration. //, The assurance given to the Sheikh in 1902 and since confirmed only promised him defence against na val attack and this appears to Sir E. Grey unobjec tionable, but to assume an obligation to protect him from aggression by land also might not only be very difficult to carry out but might also, in the event for example of a land attack on him by Turkey - a con tingency by no means impossible, especially if the Bagdad Railway is completed - involve Great Britain in a serious dispute with the Porte or with a third Power or even in a war and that perhaps at a moment when such a complication might prove excessively in convenient. /l. Sir E. Grey accordingly attaches importance to the use as regards this point of a form of words which, while convincing the Sheikh of the sincere in tention( 1006 / 10 ) Intention of His Majesty's Government to afford him all the help in their power in the contingency con templated, should yet not hind them to forcible inter vention on his behalf. /j, Sir E. Grey would suggest that the form 'they (His Majesty's Government) will safeguard you to the best of their ability against an unprovoked attack by a foreign Power or against any encroachment by such a Power on your said jurisdiction and recognized rights or upon your property in Persia' might meet the case. Sheikh Khazal also regards as possible the con tingency that His Majesty's Government might be driven to assume control of the customs of the Southern ports, including those of Mohammera and Ahwaz, and hopes that, if this happens, he will be left in immediate control of these two ports as at present. /£ On this point Sir E. Grey agrees with Sir G. Barclay in thinking that it would be undesirable to give such an undertaking as, in the unlikely contin- r \S gency contemplated, circumstances might arise in which it would be difficult or inconvenient to comply with( 1006 / 10 ) the Sheikh's wish. /&amp;v He would therefore prefer that, should the Sheikh revert to the question, he should he answered, as suggested hy Sir G. Barclay, with friendly assur ances of a general character. A? The Sheikh is also apprehensive of a general catastrophe In Persia which might compel His Majes ty's Government to intervene in the South of that country, and wishes to he assured that in such a case he and his tribesmen will be maintained in their pre sent position or, if this is impossible, that he may retain his personal revenue and be granted an asylum in India or elsewhere. /#• As regards this point it appears to Sir E. Grey that, as His Majesty's Government have recently signec the Anglo-Russian Agreement whereby they have bound themselves to respect the integrity and independence of Persia, it would be inconsistent to discuss the break-up of that country as a possible event. /. He would accordingly propose to inform the Sheikh( 1006 / 10 ) Sheikh that the contingency is one which His Majes ty’s Government cannot contemplate and to refer him to the instrument itself and to the communication made to him on December 1st 1908 in which this ques tion is expressly dealt witl Finally the Sheikh expresses the wish that the assurances given him should he couched in a form which he can show to his tribesmen to strengthen both their support of himself and their faith in the friendly policy of His Majesty’s Government. '' \ Sir E. Grey considers this request to be a rea sonable one and is disposed to sanction the adoption for the purpose indicated of the form proposed by Sir G. Barclay and Major Cox with the modification sug gested above in the passage relating to protection against molestation, &amp;c., by a foreign Power. All reference to the fact that the assurances are given on condition that the Sheikh and his male descendants continue to be acceptable to the tribesmen should. Sir E. Grey thinks, be omitted from this document. which.r q ( 1006 / 10 ) which should he handed to him at the same time as the longer form containing the text of the assurances in full, which is intended for his own information only.

[November 29.] Section 3- Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received November 29.) •(39^ (No. 207.) Sir, ^ 1 Tehran, November 9, 1909. IN ray despatch No. 147 of the 27th July I reported that the Sheikh of Moh merah was not completely satisfied with the assurances given him for himself Hra 7 “ his heirs and successors,” and that he was anxious that the words in inv an commas should be changed to “ his own successive male descendants up to a period of one hundred years.” I have taken advantage of Major Cox’s visit to Tehran to confer with him on the question of our assurances to the sheikh, and he has embodied the sheikh’s wishes in this matter in the accompanying memorandum (Inclosure 1). I trust that the explanations given by Major Cox of the reasons which have impelled the sheikh to ask for the extension of our assurances to his offspring will be considered sufficient to warrant our giving him satisfaction on ehis point. It will be noticed that the sheikh also desires an assurance of our protection for his private property. I take it that, in the event of any encroachment on his property in Persia, we should in fact find it desirable to give him the necessary assistance for a satisfactory solution, so that assurances on this head—provided they were expressly confined to his property in Persia, for we do not, of course, wish to do anything which might encourage him to acquire more property in Turkey—would not increase our practical obligations. I would therefore recommend that an assurance should also be given him on this point, and, in order to give us what would be recognised as some locus standi for helping the sheikh in the event of the Persian Government’s interfering with his property, I venture to hope that it may be found possible to give effect to Major Cox’s suggestion that a decoration be conferred upon him. A favourable moment might be after the recent agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is disclosed, provided that its disclosure does not arouse any great agitation in the Medjliss, in which latter event the bestowal of the decoration might be postponed for a while. It will be observed from Major Cox’s memorandum that the sheikh wishes to be given a document which could be shown to his tribesmen, setting forth in brief the assurances we have given him at various times, and that at a recent interview he dictated to Major Cox the form which he would like it to take. I venture to think that His Majesty’s Government might see their way to giving him this document in a somewhat modified form. Worded as it stands at present it is open to the interpreta tion that we have accepted the sheikh as a British protected person. It is also open to the objection that it contains nothing to show that our undertaking is dependent on the good behaviour of the sheikh and his offspring. These points are covered in the amended formula marked “ Inclosure 2 ” which I beg to recommend. It would probably satisfy the sheikh, and it seems to Major Cox and to me to commit us to no more than we should, even if it did not exist, find ourselves compelled in our own interests to perform. The proposed formula covers the points already referred to in this despatch, i.e., the extension of our assurances to the sheikh’s male descendants for a stated period and protection for his property in Persia, but does not include two further assurances which the sheikh desires to obtain, viz., those which relate to his treatment in the event of Great Britain’s seizing the southern customs or intervening in the south. Major Cox and I have discussed these two points, and he thinks that it would be possible if the sheikh reverts to the question to make him understand that His Majesty’s Government cannot give undertakings contingent on action of their own which they cannot regard as at all probable, and to satisfy him on the points in question with general friendly verbal assurances. On this point if His Majesty’s Government have any special instructions they might be given to Major Cox before his return to his post. I have, &amp;c G. BARCLAY. [2491 /—3] i.Tnelosure 1 in No. 1. Memorandum by Major Cox on Assurances desired by the Sheikh of Mohammerah, ^ BEFORE I left the Gulf for England Sheikh Khazal begged me to lay his circum stances and aspirations before His Majesty’s Minister and Government, and after my arrival in England he sent me a telegram which was intended to remind me on the subject. We have, of course, given the sheikh a generous amount of sympathetic support of late, and have considerably strengthened the assurances previously given to him. He is still, however, nervous for the future on certain points, and anxious for further signs, and I am inclined to think that when the nature of his apprehensions, and the facts at the back of them are examined, His Majesty’s Government may find it possible to satisfy him without any practical increase in the weight of the obligations wdiich they have already accepted in regard to him, In spite of what we have hitherto given him in the way of assurances— 1. He is always in fear that his nephew Hanzal, a man of about 40, whose loyalty is doubtful, and who was recently suspected and accused of being implies ted m a plot against his (Sheikh Khazai’s) life, may seize some favourable opportunity to affect his own or his son’s assassination and usurp the sheikhdom. It is to provide against this or a similar contingency, and in order that Hanzal may know that it is useless his aspiring to the succession that the sheikh asks that the words “ heirs and successors ” be amended to “ male descendents,” &amp;c. (vide my letter of the 16th May 1909.) Sheikh Khazal quite realises that we could only support a descendent so long as the said descendent continued to act up to his obligations to us generally, and was acceptable to his tribesmen ; and, as regards the latter, he says he would be prepared, if we wish it, to obtain the signification of the assent of the elders to the succession of his children. If the assurances were worded somewhat as follows : “ Male descendents provided that they continued to satisfy their obligations to His Majesty’s Government and are acceptable to their tribesmen ; ” it would please Sheikh Khazal greatly, and I do not see that by doing so we should in practice be further committed to any serious extent than we are now. It is obvious, and this the sheikh well understands, that if he or one of his descendents proved an unsatisfactory ruler, or failed to act up to his obligations to us, he would be considered to have forfeited the right to our support. 2. Sheikh Khazal still fears that some day, either as a complement to Russian action in the north or as a result of the existence of continued chaos in the country, we may be obliged to intervene in Southern Persia and perhaps find it convenient to take over Mohammerah. From thisj apprehension results his desire that our assurances should be recorded as holding good for a specific period. Here again it seems to me that it would be possible to find a form of words which would satisfy him without inconveniently committing us, e.g., would “ male descendents to the third generation, provided that,” &amp;c., be out of the question ? It is always our policy with these Arab rulers, e.g., Bahrein, Koweit, trucial chiefs, to guide them and control their external relations but leave them independent in regard to their internal politics. 3. Apart from his position as Sheikh of Mohammerah and district and the property which he enjoys as such, Sheikh Khazal is apprehensive for the future safety of his person and of the property and income which he possesses and enjoys as a private individual. In this position he may be compared to the Zil-es-Sultan, to whom on certain conditions and in view of certain facts we have given a great deal of help in the direction of safeguarding his person and private property. One of the grounds on which we do so (or did so) is because the Zil enjoys a British decoration, and I think that the bestowal of a British decoration would be a convenient way of showing support to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. It would certainly please the Sheikh. The Sultan of Muscat has a G.C.I.E. May I suggest a K.C.I.E, for Mohammerah ? 4. Sheikh Khazal thinks it possible that we may be driven to assume control of the customs of the south, including his. In that contingency, however, he hopes that we will leave him in immediatecontrol of the Mohammerah and Ah was customs, as at present, by farming them to him at a figure based on the average receipts for a past term of years, subject to periodical revision. Can we meet his wishes in this direction ? 5. Having regard to the possibility which he apprehends of the break up of Persia and of our intervention in the south, he would be relieved by an assurance that we would maintain him and his tribesmen in the enjoyment of their present rights and territory and internal autonomy as we do now in the case of Bahrein, Koweit, &amp;c., and that in case it should be found possible to preserve that state of things, we would undertake to give him the personal revenue he now enjoys and give him an asylum in India or elsewhere. 6. Quite apart from the desired assurances set forth in the foregoing paragraph, the sheikh explains that the resume of the various assurances given him from time to time up to now, which I recorded at his request in my letter to him dated the 16th May, 1909, is in that form suitable for his own information; but that owing to the references made in it to previous documents and previous occasions and the length of this letter, it is not a document which he could conveniently show to, or would be comprehended by, his tribal elders. On the other hand, he considers it of urgent importance that he should, in order to quiet any apprehensions on the part of his tribesmen, and also to strengthen their support of himself and their faith in the friendly policy of the British Grovernment, have some brief form of written assurance in general terms which he can show to them. Asked to state offhand what sort of form and terms such an assurance as he had in mind should, in his opinion, take, he dictated the words of which I attach a literal translation. It seems to me that, with slight modifications, it could be put into a form which His Majesty’s Government might be able to approve and which would suffice for the sheikh’s purpose. P. Z. C.

Sheikh Mubarek appears to be in a very friendly mood at present, as instanced by his spontaneous offer of the Agency rent free, and by this conversa tion, but I think there must be some ulterior motive in all this affability. No. 562, dated Koweit, nth October 1909. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, LA., Political Agent, Koweit, To—The First Assistant Resident, in charge of the Residency, Bushire. I have the honour to report the substance of a conversation which the Sheikh of Mubarak held with me a few days ago on the affairs of the Sheikh of Moham- merah in case it may prove of interest to Government. 2 . It appears that shortly after Major Cox’s last visit to Mohammerah Sheikh Khazal called together the headmen of his tribes and discussed with them the advantages of definitely binding himself to the British Government by a document, which evidently from Sheikh Mubarak’s description was intended' to be a regular treaty on more or less equal terms. The headmen of the tribes were very averse to any such proposal pointing out that, though they might make a treaty and so avoid Persian and Turkish interference in their affairs, they would be subjected to endless interference from the British who would, little by little, reduce them and their Sheikh (Khazal) to the condition of Bahrein, where now nothing was possible without the ‘ order ’ of the Political Agent; they could see no compensating advantage in such an arrangement especially as at present they found that a combination of all the ^ near Arab tribes could make things so unpleasant for either Persian or Turks that Moham merah generally succeeded in securing its own way very satisfactorily. Sheikh Khazal was, however, insistent and pointed out that, though such had been the case of Bahrein, it had been brought about from within by the Khalifa family’s own foolish method of working and contrasted our treatment of Bahrein with that of Koweit, where a Political Agent had proved of considerable help to Sheikh Mubarak. Finally, it appears that, by argument, specious promises and lavish hospitality Sheikh Khazal prevailed on his Cha’ab headmen to agree that, if he put his signature to any document of the kind contemplated, they would follow his lead and also append their signatures. In reply to my query as to why Sheikh Khazal should be so anxious to secure the signature of the headmen to such a document as well as his own, Sheikh Mubarak pointed out that that was the only certain way by which Sheikh Khazal could bind all the various subtribes to their promise, fearing as he did, if anything subsequently occurred to which one of the tribes objected, that he might be unable to prevent all of them siding with the disappointed one and leaving him without the necessary support either to force compliance or induce it pacifically. 3 . The above was conveyed to me by Sheikh Mubarak quite spontaneously # and, at the moment, struck me as being specially produced for British consump tion or as a ballon d’essai. Then, on his own account, Sheikh Mubarak urged the advantages to the British Government in some such tie, pointing out that between them he and Sheikh Khazal owned practically the whole of the cultivated land on the Shatt-eFArab up to Mohammerah and beyond. 4 . I have no doubt, from the careful way in which the Sheikh expressed himself, that this communication and probably the form of it were carefully arranged between himself and Sheikh Khazal at one of their frequent meetings at Failiya solely with an eye to their own advantage ; each desires to rid himself2 of what authority the Turkish or Persian Government may have over him and to replace it for the benevolent protection ol the British Government. Though the Sheikhs mav talk of the benefits of such protection, their sole idea is that, when obtained it will give them a guarantee from foreign aggression whi e leaving them ^ absolute’within their own territories to do what they please with life and property * within their respective jurisdictions. - i have reported the conversation not so much as likely to lead to anything further but to show how these two Sheikhs regard matters in this region. For it must be remembered, though this of course is never even hinted exactly the same means which the two Sheikhs employ to achieve their ends with their present suzerains could be used with equal effect against ourselves and regret to have to state that, in my opinion, I do not think Sheikh Mubarak would have the slightest hesitation in concerting any such move if he thought he had the least chance of obtaining a successful issue.

I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of a despatch which I have received from His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire reporting the assurances ^ given by him to the sheikh of Mohammerah in the form authorised by you in your ' 2 ^°*) / telegram No. 164 of the 17th April last. It will be noticed that the sheikh is not yet entirely satisfied. He asks that our assurances may be extended to his own successive male descendants, and that it should be stated that these assurances should hold good for 100, or better, 150 years. The sheikh apparently does not expect an answer to his request until Major Cox has talked the matter over with me. I had expected Major Cox to visit Tehran on his way home to England, but he has been unexpectedly delayed at his post. I gather that he has to be in England by a certain date, and he therefore now wishes to proceed home direct. In these circumstances he will not visit Tehran until October. Even if he had not been delayed, this would probably have been the better course, as the state of the southern roads may have improved by then. I have, &amp;c. G.

I was further directed to explain to you that the British Government had engaged to respect the integrity and independence of Persia, and^ that that undertaking in itself involved the maintenance of the status quo in Persia, and thus included the continuance of the same state of autonomy which your Excellency at piesent enjoys. I was then to point out that it followed from the above that any external aggression upon your Excellency would constitute an act of infringement of that Persian integrity which has received recognition in the Anglo-Russian Convention. While expressing your thanks for these amplified assurances, you represented that they seemed to you only to safeguard you so long as Persia continued to exist as a sovereign State and you pressed for a further assurance which would cover the contingency of Persia ceasing to exist as a sovereign State and the intervention or occupation by foreign Powers. You also expressed doubt as to whether the present assurance only provided immunity against unwarrantable encroachment on your rights by the absolute govern ment of His Majesty the Shah, or whether it also covered prevention of similar action on the part of parliamentary government. Tn reply to those representations, your Excellency was informed that Great Britain and Russia being pledged to respect the integrity of Persia, the British Government were not, properly speaking, able to admit even the possibility of Persia ceasing to be a sovereign State or coming under the occupation of a foreign Power, but that in the unlikely event of such a contingency I I was further permitted to inform you that whatever change might take place in the form of government in Persia the British Government were prepared to give you the same support against any encroachment on your rights as was promised to you m 1902, and I was authorised to add that they were now prepared to extend the application of those assurances to your “ heirs and successors.” Mr. McDouall and I have informed you that in our opinion the assurances as now extended and expressed, appear to satisfy all your requirements ; but you have further requested that the words “heirs and successors ” may be changed and the words “ own successive male descendants ” may be written instead ; and you have gone on to express the hope that His Majesty’s Government will be pleased to dispel the last shadow of doubt from your mind regarding their own intentions in the future, by adding after the words “male descendants ” as above, the words “up to a period of 100 years ” (or if it be possible 150 years).

The former of these messages repeats a telegram from His Majesty's Consul-General at Bushire, in which he expresses the opinion that the Sheikh will require from him some definite reply, first as to whether hie guarantees already given include protection against the violation of his rights hy a possible constitution al government in Persia and secondly as to the exten sion of those guarantees to his immediate offspring. The later telegram contains Sir G.Barclay's ob servations(13250/09) Cft obBervations on the first of these two points. With regard to this first question. Sir E.Grey would suggest that the Sheikh should he informed that His Majesty’s Government are prepared to give him the same support against any encroachment on his rights as already promised in 1902 whatever changes there may he in the Government of Persia. With regard to the question of the extension to the Sheikh's immediate offspring of the guarantees already given, the Sheikh might he reminded that these assurances have already been extended to his succes sors and that as these will presumably be his off spring, our assurances do in fact already apply ^o the latter. If this declaration fails to satisfy the Sheikh, Sir E.Grey sees no objection to a formal ex tension to 'his heirs and successors' of the guaran tees already given, since, should the Sheikh s imme diate offspring fail to govern successfully and be expelled. His Majesty’s Government would be no more bound to uphold them than they now are to uphold hxs successors.(l'5250/09) successors.

I cannot but think that th&amp; seemingly unsympathetic tone of the reply of H.M.Ct, on this point ^•s conveyed in your Tel. No 69 March 38$h must be due to maladroit representations on my part. Sheikh became vehement under pressure of great, anxiety but he does not consider or suggest that we are under 'obligation to grant hin^oan.'He simply countin this connection on our friendly desire to promote his interests. I believe fOMX his representation re loan to be prompted by following consideration of self-preservation which are but reason able. Recent events connected with reportod Dutch concession have given urgent point to his belief that the best way of safeguarding himself and preventing a corrupt Tehran G-ovt from springing non British concessions on him is for him to start utilitarian projects himself with least possible delay. His difficulty in so doing is his inability to lay his hands at any moment on requisite amount . Of cash. Fhe.t, be confidently hopes for is the certain assurances that sre vill do our best to assist him to find money for such pur 'ooses when the need arises either by means of Govt loan or introduction to British f i n aneic' ^ * In the matter of a small loan it would obviously be/X&lt;^ exceedingly difficult for me to make Sheikh understand why the Oort of India were unwilling to give him temporary accomodation c they have done his friend Sheikh Mubarak. , In view of vital importance of our maintaining paramount influence with him in immediate future could I not be permit to give him a reply somewhat on the following linoe? Firstly that in case of a small loan Govt of India vrould do their best to arrange to accomodate him on learning the amount and object in .low. Secondly that in case of large sum being required for utilitarian schemeNHBttl ( 2 ) schemo he might rely or general desire of British Govt to promote prosperity of himself a^nd his territorj' and that provided that proposals and prospects represented were serious and satisfactory they would endeavour to put him in the way of obtaining money from British sources if they could not see their way to lend it them- i^lves .

Sir E. Grey proposes, with Viscount Morley's con currence, to approve Sir G.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 28, 4 p.m.) (No. 203.) J Tehran, March 28, 2 p.m. MY telegram No. 199. Sheikh of Mohammerah, Sirdar Assad, and the Governor of Arabistan have sent a joint telegram to Shah professing loyalty but 'urging His Majesty to grant a Constitution.Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey .— {Beceived March 5 p.m.) (No. 199.) t Tehran, March^L 5’30 p.m. BEFORE I received your telegram No. 109, Cox had already returned to Bushire as he found at Mohammerah that the Sheikh was leaving for Ahwaz, and he wished to avoid if possible being out of touch with the Gulf ports. Following extracts from a telegram from him No. 251 26th March show result of his visit:— Cox found Sheikh much worried. Strong pressure was being exerted on him from Nejef and elsewhere to embrace popular cause, and difficulty of his position was aggravated by the impossibility of telegraphing to Shah or Government without being censored at Ispahan. “ Part 1. Sheikh stated that situation at Mohammerah now rendered much more critical by news of recent events at Bunder Abbas and Bushire, and he anticipated that unruly Nationalist levies would now turn their attention to his out-lying ports of Dilam Hindean, &amp;c.” He continued that unless I could give him assurances that British Government would give him effective support in resisting Nationalists and would protect him against subsequent consequences of his so doing he could not hold out much longer, and must take some course which wmuld save his face with both parties. I replied that I was not authorized to give any such guarantee. He went on to explain that if customs receipts continued to be forwarded to Tehran, Nationalist resentment would be unrestrainable ; that he as head of Mohammerah would be made responsible for receipts and that, in absence of definite advice or intervention from us, he would be unable to avoid asking Belgian Director to retain receipts under adequate guard in Customs premises until atmosphere became clearer. “ Part 2. Text of assurances. What the Sheikh hopes for is, first to be assured that we will not permit any Persian regime, whether autocratic or constitutional, to disturb status quo in regard to himself or his successors; secondly, that we ourselves will not disturb it as long as he fulfils his obligations to us, and thirdly, that we will oppose any other Power attempting to do so. Realizing from my replies to his inquiries that dynastic guarantee could not he expected, he earnestly begged that assurances given him might at all events be extended to his immediate offspring, subject, of course, to their giving us satisfaction. He expressed readiness to satisfy us as to concurrence of tribal Sheikhs.” “ Part 3. As regards irrigation question, his present apprehensions nave been allayed. I also discussed scheme fully with Willcocks, who is recording his conclusions in a Memorandum for me. Primd facie, he considers present project calculated to have a deleterious effect on shareholders of Sheikh’s existing date gardens on Abadan and Shat-el-Arab.” “ Part 4. As regards loan, Sheikh will be content for the present with the provisional assurance that we are ready to grant a loan on suitable terms, and that he need not look elsewhere. Character of security or quid yro quo to be given by nm cannot be decided until he has found the old Firmans on which his tenure is baser. For these he is now searching. It is suggested that in the event of irrigation or other utilitarian scheme being undertaken by him with our assistance, a lien on t le woi vs as they progressed would be a feasible form of security.” Cox tells me privately that Sheikh is reassured and for the moment reasonable I am asking him whether he considers having regard to your te egiam i o. « , which I am repeating to him, any further communication to Sheikh desira j o. e | 1 s contemplated action in regard to Customs seems unobjectionable, am . am e Cox so. * ■V r 15iCONFIDENTIAL. \y Sir Edward Grey to Sir G.

Politics in Mesopotamia. AT the end of last month Mirza Hamza, agent of Sheikh Khazal, the Ruler of Mohammerah, left for India en route to London. It is rumoured that he is travelling on a tour and for a change, but this is only a falsehood, and he has not left here for anything but a political business in hand of ruinous results for Mesopotamia. Mirza Hamza left on behalf of his Sheikh, and Mr. Archibald Lyle, agent of Gray, Mackenzie steamers in Bussorah, on behalf of the Sheikh of Koweit, or the Sultan of Koweit, as some people pretend to call him. The said agent travelled via Bagdad with the pretext that in doing this his intention is to go to Constantinople. Just a few days before his departure the owner of Koweit invited him for a consultation in closing an Agreement with England. When the Sheikh of Mohammerah saw his friend entering into an Agreement with England, he also, who had been preparing himself for this for some time, wished to join him in the shameful act. Also Mr. Crow, British Consul in Bussorah, left for London on a six months’ furlough, and it is known to everybody that he left for the purpose of fulfilling the Agreement between his Government and the two Rulers of Koweit and Mohammerah. Woe to them, if they only knew what England did with people, when they dared to do this disgraceful act. It is their want of sincerity to their respective Governments and lack of patriotism that prompted them to this act. They are left to their discretion to act as they wish, and there is nobody to prevent them. In this they are justified. As for the Turkish Government, which is a praiseworthy one, it is a Government of honour for Islam. If it was the misconduct of some of the officials, who forget everything and wink their eyes at everything to such an extent of indifference that it resulted in the inclination of Koweit to England, we ask our Lord the Sultan— whom God may exalt!—to send to these countries officials true to their Government and nation, so that internal disorders may subside. We do not know what the two Sheikhs expect in delivering themselves up to England. England has introduced herself in their affairs, and British underhand politics are already in activity in Mesopotamia, especially in Koweit and Mohammerah, causing ruin and destruction. England is introducing arms in Mesopotamia from the two places above mentioned to such an extent that you find even a boy not yet 14 years of age armed with a rifle. [1900 2 ] submit 't to your bxeeben2 All this is caused by the two Sheikhs, and we are not alarmed for their account, hut for our fatherland and our own selves, because if England strengthens her position in Koweit and Mohammerah internal disorders will increase in Mesopotamia more than they are at present. M^hat is the advice, what course is to be taken, and what is to be done ? England is carrying out her underhand politics and instigating internal quarrels, the transport of arms on her steamers, to an extent that Mesopotamia is full of fire. “Ee inna Tillah ve inna ileyhi el rajioun” (“ We are God’s, and to him we belong”— from the Koran). We wish that the sincere men of the Turkish Government in Constantinople attempt to amend the calamity before it grows larger, and free Mesopotamia from this great affliction, so that general order and quietude may be restored among its people. And all are in the hand of God. (Signed) KAROUN.

Relations with Mohammerah and the Bakhtiari Khans. Your telegram of 12th ultimo. We have consulted Cox, who has replied as follows, dated 4th July, No. 71, Shiraz “ With reference to Government of India telegram, S. 379, 16th June. As regards protection of Mohammerah against external aggression, communi cation proposed in telegram from Secretary of State seems to he sufficient. As regards maintenance of present status of Sheikh, I suggest that we might remind him that relations between himself and the British have been close and sympathetic m the past, and intimate that as long as he and his successors adhere to these traditions and show themselves ready to promote legitimate interests of British commerce and enterprise in their jurisdiction we shall continue to regard maintenance of their prosperity and present status as being important in our own interests, and that he may therefore rest assured that we shall be disposed to give him and his successors the utmost support compatible with strict loyalty on their part to the Persian Government, and with our own engagements to respect integrity of Persia. If possible I would add that in return for such assurance we ask bheikh to undertake on behalf of himself and successors to take private friendly counsel with us before committing themselves in connection with concessions, loans, or other engagements to Foreign Powers or nationals. Should Consul at Mohammerah make special suggestions they will be sent as soon as received. . . . As regards Bakhtiaris, 1 have been waiting to communicate with Lorimmer. He thinks idea mooted in 1904 in connection with tribal levies will not be practicable under any conditions compatible with present status of Bakhtiaris and our own engagement to respect integrity of Persia and, as he thinks that Khans aim at complete independence, he anticipates that any definite undertaking or agreement would be frequently appealed to by them for their own purposes. As far as any definite pledge is concerned I agree ; but on the other hand, we have now to consider that the apparently bright prospects of the oil industry, and the possibility of profitable irrigation greatly emphasize importance to us of strengthening our own position m the region in question, and of keeping the influence and enterprise of other Powers at a distance. In the circumstances, I do not see why we should not give Khans a verbal assurance on the lines above suggested m the case of Sheikh of Mohammerah, adding the warning that such assurance applied to duly constituted representatives of the Bakhtiari tribes, and not to individual Khans with whose family dissensions we are not concerned. It does not seem that such assurance would be opposed to terms of convention with Russia.” We agree with Cox as to Mohammerah. We think that it would be unsafe to enter into negotiations with Bakhtiari Khans, and would not give verbal assurances proposed by Cox. w . SluN* (p ? ^ \■HMflMI jsvg i aSk i f.&lt;-p j44? (No. 123.

I must confess that I was quite unprepared to see the negotiations on which I reported in my despatch Not 97 of the 23rd April arrive at a result so speedily. I cannot entertain very sanguine hopes as to the durability of such an arrangement, but so long as it lasts it seems calculated to assist in promoting peace and preserving order in the regions governed by the respective Chieftains—regions where there are numerous and important British interests—and as such I venture to think that its conclusion may not be displeasing to His Majesty’s Government. To my mind the arrangement seems to be a step in the right direction, and all the more satisfactory in that it was taken without foreign instigation or assistance. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M.

I HAVE the honour to report that the Sardar Arfa went to Wais to meet the Bakhtiari Khans ; owing to illness he was unable to remain, and Salar Arfa, Shehab- es-Saltaneh, and Sarim-el-Mulk returned to Mohammerah with him on the 14th April and left on the 21st. On that day they called on me with Haji Rais Tujar to represent the Sardar Arfa, who was unable to come ashore owing to the abscess he is suffering from. They informed me that they had now conferred with the Sardar Arfa and made friends with him, and made a formal written alliance with him ; that in future they are to act together, and their respective tribesmen must obey the chief of the district, Arab or Bakhtiari, in which they happen to be. They are to act together in loyal service to the Government and people of Persia so long as there is no interference with the various concessions held by them respectively or increase in the taxes demanded; but if such interference or alteration in taxes is made they will act as one in resisting it. They hope that this will tend to render the country, and espe cially the Ispahan road, perpetually safe. Haji Rais Tujar confirmed this, and both parties called on me to witness that they had made this agreement, and in the event of any dispute occurring between them they asked that we should inquire and, on finding out with whom the fault lay, advise that party that he is in the wrong. The Salar Arfa said that the Legation had on several occasions advised them to make friends with the Sardar Arfa, and now that they had done so they hoped that the Legation might be able to give them a certain increased amount of support in Tehran. 1 said that I was very glad to hear that they had made friends, which should tend to increased security for trade in these districts ; that I would report the matter to His Majesty’s Legation and Consul-General, Bushire ; and that I would always be glad to assist by advice in preventing any disagreement between them. It had appeared to me that there had heen a difficulty in arranging matters before owing to the Khans them- [1813 i —23j2 selves not always acting together. Both the Salar Arfa and Shehab-es-Saltaneh assured me that there was no likelihood of any differences between the Khans themselves in future, and that the Sardar Arfa will use his influence to prevent any difference between them.

Butler, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to forward for information and such consideration as may be possible, copies of the undermentioned papers — (1) A memorandum giving details of an interview between myself, accom panied by Mr, Consul McDouall, and Sheikh Khazal of Moham- merah on 7th January last. A letter No. 44, dated 3rd February 1908, received from His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, in which the latter reports the purport of a conversation which he recently had with the Bakhtyari Khans, Salar-i-Arfa and Shahab-es-Sultaneh. The Sheikh of Mohammerah asked me to await receipt of the memorandum of State expenditure which he was preparing, before taking special action on his representations, and when the summary of the said document reached Bushire I was away on tour ; meanwhile Captain Lorimer’s report also reached me. 2. In connection with the abovementioned papers I beg to refer to, and to quote for facility of reference, a memorandum recorded by Sir Louis Dane at the time of the tour made by His Excellency Lord Curzon and Sir Arthur Hardinge to the Persian Gulf in the winter of 1903. The passage I refer to runs as foil jws ; {vide enclosure to Foreign Department, No. 694-E.A., dated 1st March 1904):— “ The question of increasing our influence in the Lur and Bakhtyari country * * and of strengthening the tribes in South-Western Persia, so as to enable them to hold their own in the event of a collapse of the central power or trouble in South-Western Persia was discussed on several occasions by His Excellency with Sir Arthur Hardinge. * * * * It was recognised that our future action in South-Western Persia must largely depend on the extent to which we could strengthen and utilise both tribes and the tribes of Arabistan, who under the Sheikh of Mohammerah are in much the same posi tion 3. It will be seen from my present enclosures that practically simultaneously though independently, the Chiefs of the Bakhtyaris and of the Arab tribes of Arabistan respectively have become apprehensive as to their future and convinced that their interests lie in union among themselves, if possible under our aegis. The Sheikh of Mohammerah, encouraged no doubt by the understanding at which his fidus Achates Sheikh Mubarek has arrived at with us, presses for an assurance that his lineal heirs will be maintained in the enjoyment of their present patrimony, and will be reasonably safeguarded against curtailment of their present semi-independent position and powers, by the Central Government. As arguments in support of his rights or strong claims to such treatment Sheikh Khazal adduces the facts that ever since his accession the Central Government have obliged him to meet from private funds very heavy expenditure which should properly have fallen on the Government Exchequer, and that now during the current Turco-Persian crisis the Central Government have left him, absolutely to take care of himself in the best way he can, in fact, have neither the means nor the power to do anything to help him in the event of his territory being invaded by Turkish troops. In this respect he is in a measure comforted by his confidence in Great Britain to prevent any attack upon him by sea but in the event of an invasion from the landside he feels that he would be placed in a very serious position, seeing that he possesses no artillery or large supply of ammuni tion. f ^ / I V* In return for such assurances from us as his heart desires he expresses readiness to bind himself to us in any way which may seem to us feasible. his !l2 The Bakhtiaris intimate that, prompted by the common sentiments of self- preservation, they contemplate allying themselves with the Sheikh of Moham- merah, and in the hope of thus maintaining a position of semi or practical inde pendence they are anxious to enter into a secret understanding with the British Government. I do not feel that I can safely or usefully offer much comment upon their re- spective representations, as in such a question my field of vision is too confined . to allow me to see the matter in the right perspective. I can only say as a local officer that it seems to me that having by the terms of our convention with Russia left the region affected, in the neutral zone and exposed to German enterprise, it is of the utmost importance to our interests to counteract the advantages of that circumstance as far as possible and without delay, by strengthening our hold as much as we can upon the Chiefs of South Western Persia before the opportunity to do so passes out of our control. As far as the Sheikh of Mohammerah is concerned, I believe him to be primarily quite sincere in his protestations that his interests and hopes are centred in us. 'Nevertheless he is mainly prompted by the dictates of self-preservation and should there be failure on our part to dispel his apprehensions, it is as well to remember that he is likely to be greatly influenced by his astute henchman and relative Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar, who is possessed by no feelings of tradition or senti ment or by any considerations other than those of personal agrandisement and present profit, and would, I doubt not, as lief pursue his schemes through German auspices as ours, if the former w r ere made sufficiently attractive to him and ours were too lukewarm. Whether the aspirations of the Sheikh and the Khans can be entertained to any degree or not, I feel sure that the problem of which they are factors will have the early and interested consideration of Government. A duplicate of this letter is being forwarded to His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires, Tehran, under my office No. 44—943 of to-day’s date. Note regarding an interview which took place between the Sheikh Khazal of Moharnmerah and the Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Dated Jth January igoS. At my last visit to Mohammerah on the 16th December 1907, in connection with the delivery to the bheikh of the Humaidi pirates, Sheikh Khazal who in the course of our discussion regarding the punishment of the outlaws, had inci dentally shown that he had heard of our recent agreement with Sheikh Mubarek, informed me as I was leaving that he had urgent grounds for wishing to discuss his affairs generally with me and begged me to pay him a leisurely visit at an early date for the purpose. I did so on 7th January, and having gone there for this express purpose, 1 took such previous papers as were necessary with me. Mr. McDouall was present with me. Sheikh Khazal having in the first instance led me to think that he needed more definite support or assurances from us, I read him out the purport of Sir Arthur Hardinge’s letters of December 7th, 1902 and December 24th, 1903 and then enquired what fuither he needed. Sheikh Khazal replied that the assurances just referred to w r ere all right so far as they went and at the epoch at which they w 7 ere given but that the outlook had much changed and developed since 1903 and that he could not but regard the near future with the greatest apprehension. It was the advent of the “ Majlis ” and the so-called constitutional government which had changed the aspect of the future so much. One of two things must soon happen, either the Shah or the Majlis must be eliminated. If the probability was that the Shah would be able to suppress the Majlis, as there was no doubt he would like to do, and if there was to be a return to absolute Government, then he would not feel so apprehen sive, for he was fortified by the assurance which we had given him to afford him our good offices and support with the Central Government, and, as long as he remained faithful to the Shah and followed our advice, to protect him against attack by water under any pretext. But it now appeared to him and hisadvisers, either that the Majlis would get the upper hand of the Shah and that the latter would become a mere puppet in their hands or else that the Majlis would break up and that a general upheaval would supervene, which would prompt or oblige Foreign Powers to interfere and that a scramble would result. In either eventuality he felt that he wmuld be in great jeopardy. We repeated to him the purport of a recent telegram to the effect that Russia and England had specifically undertaken to respect the integrity of Persia and asked what he especially fears from the Majlis or from Constitutional Government. He replied that the Majlis and the now free Press had always been hostile to him. The papers had repeatedly been attacking him lately, for everything he did. Thus he had been attacked for the Beni Truf Expedition and for his friendship with Sheikh Mubarek. He knew that the Russians, who were all-powerful in Tehran in the way of pulling strings, were hostile to him and fostered these attacks, and he believed that the first thing that the Constitutional Government would do under the pretext of reform would be to attempt to clip his wdngs and to intrench further upon his hereditary and established rights. Something in that direction was bound to happen, and it was of vital importance to him to know in the event of (i) the break up of Persia or (2) the attempt of the Majlis to reduce him to nothing, what the policy of His Majesty’s Government would be, and how far they could reassure him now. He begged that we would consider the question of giving him a writing, assuring him (1) that we would to the utmost of our power prevent his absorption by any. other power and that he and his children would be maintained in the enjoyment of their patrimony; (2) that just as we had hitherto undertaken to protect Mohammerah from attack by a Foreign Power (whatever pretext for such action be alleged) and also that we would continue to give him our support and good offices so long as he remained faithful to the Shah and acted in accordance with our advice—similarly, we would now extend that undertaking and promise him immunity against the inroads of the Majlis upon his powers. He expressed the conviction that his salvation lay in forming connections with one of the great European Nations and that among those Nations his interests and ideas were identical with those of Great Britain and not with those of any other Power and that in return for such fresh assurances as those indicated he was prepared to take upon himself obligations to the British Government in any terms that they might think advisable. The Sheikh then went on to speak of the Turco-Persian question complain ing that although the Central Government sought to curtail his powers and independence, they left him, in an urgent matter like this, in the dark and in the lurch, and without special funds [yide Residency telegram, No. 16—54, dated 18th January 1908). He enlarged on this fact and went on to speak of the enormous extra expenditure that he had been put to by the Persian Government in connection with measures of government which should properly fall on the Government Exchequer. He begged leave to have prepared and to place before me for the confidential information of Government a statement of such expenditure which he had incurred. He concluded with the promise to have this drawn up as soon as possible, but it was not received by me until the end of February. P. Z. COX, Major } Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

R.Lorimer, i. a., His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul for Arabistan, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to communicate a proposal propounded by the Salar Arba and Shahab-us-Sultanah in their brief interview with me at Maidan Munaf- tun on 23rd January. o On thlc nrra&lt;;ir,n thpv made the startling announcement that, after due the Persian Government that they were contemplating tnrowmg on auegiance to it. They had entered into negotiations with Sheikh Khazal on the subjectand would have me understand that they had made some progress in them, and that the Sheikh had indicated that he shared their feelings and aspirations. It was proposed to have a personal meeting with him in order to bring matters to a practical issue in the form of a treaty or convention, and for this purpose they intended to shortly pay a visit to Nasiri. There they would exchange written undertakings with the Sheikh, which they would ask me to guarantee. Their ambition was to attain the position of ^ttflsi'-independent protectorates, of which they cited Maskat and Koweit as examples, and with this end in view they were prepared to accept our sovereignty, paying their revenues to us^ and putting their population at our disposal for military training. They recognised that their agreements among themselves lacked stability, and they would look to us to enforce on both sides the observance of their treaty with the Sheikh. 3. Previously, and in my absence, the Shahab had begged my Mirza to gain my adherence to their project, and professed the Khans’ willingness to furnish us with all necessary signed agreements. My Mirza expressed himself doubtful of my attaching much weight to their signed undertakings, gently re minding the Shahab that the seal on the document which he had handed me at Kima last March was yet scarcely dry. This silenced the Shahab, who did not want the Salar’s curiosity aroused regarding that episode in his past career. 4. In the course of the conversation the Salar remarked that they had some 40,000 subjects capable of bearing arms, but of these only some 10,000 were provided with fire-arms. This estimate, I may observe, is the most sane statement of the fighting strength of the Bakhtyari tribes which I have yet had made to me. The Salar also said that some British representative (Colonel Douglas in 1904 ? ) had approached them on the subject of raising and training forces in their country. At that time they were not prepared to favour such a step, but that their feelings had undergone a change, and that now they were anxious for it. Let us now play up to our own proposals. 5. I answered very briefly that I was unable personally to make them any reply, but that I would lay their proposals before my Government. I also stated that their proposals appeared to me to involve issues of great magnitude, and of such a nature that our engagements with Persia and other powers would make it very difficult for us to accept any part in them. 6. The short time at my command and my unwillingness to display too great interest in the subversive projects of the Khans, prevented me from attempting to draw from them a more detailed statement of the precise course of action they have in view, and of the means and methods which they propose to employ. I can therefore only communicate the above prdcis of what passed between us. This I do merely for the information of Government. I do not propose to offer any comments on a subject which stands to be judged on general and not local grounds, but I may remark that I question the probability of Sheikh Khazal’s committing himself in the way desired by the Khans, though he may, to gain fugitive objects, discuss the matter with them with apparent seriousness. I would also point out that, if rejected in their full scope, the avowed desires of the Khans might possibly still be taken advantage of in part, as a means of attaining the aims which Government held in 1904 as regards the raising of Militia under our control among the Bakhtyaris and the tribes of Western Luristan. 7. In the event of the Khans carrying out their projected visit to Nasiri and meeting with the Sheikh, their proposals are likely to be presented to me in a more concrete and urgent form by themselves, and possibly by the Sheikh, I should wish to be furnished with instructions regarding the attitude which I should observe, before such a contingency arises.

Question of British Consular Representation in El Hasa and Katif IV. Mohammerah .. .. .. 13 .. 14 7 I .—The Arms Traffic. (Communicated by the India Office.) THE position in regard to the arms traffic on the various sections of the Persian Gulf littoral is briefly as follows :— 1 . Muscat .—Muscat has for many years been an emporium for the arms traffic, and the trade has now attained to such dimensions that in 1906-7 the total value of the imports of arms and ammunition amounted to 112,338/. The situation is governed by the fact that the Sultan of Muscat has Commercial Treaties with Prance, Holland, and the LFnited States, under the terms of which it would be impossible for him to impose special restrictions on the importation of arms and ammunition into his dominions without the consent of the Powers in question. The result is that arms flow freely into Muscat, and are thence distributed throughout Persia, Arabia, and Afghanistan. Prom the last-named country a con siderable proportion of the arms find their way to the tribesmen of the Indian North- W est Frontier, with results which have been described by the Government of India as “ constituting a grave menace to the peace of the border.” To such an alarming extent has this process been going on that in February 1907 the Government of Govern- India estimated that out of the 270,000 men belonging to the frontier tribes no less than 94,000 possessed breech-loading rifled arms. The view is pretty generally held that, until Muscat is closed to the importation February of arms it will be impossible to place any effective check on the export trade by 21, 1907. native dhows to other ports on the Gulf littoral. 1 he total number of rifles imported from Great Britain into Muscat reached 13,831 in the year 1900. During the two following years there was a marked decline, but in 1904-5 the total number of imported rifles was believed to be not less than 20,000. Piecent figures point to a still more remarkable increase, and the custom house returns show that, during the quarter ending the 30th September, 1907, some India Office 10,000 rifles and 7,000,000 cartridges were shipped from the United Kingdom to to Foreign Muscat. Besides the imports from this country there is known to he a considerable trade with the port of Marseilles. The Government of India calculated in February 26, 1907 . 1907 that, whereas in 1899-1900 only about one-seventh of the imports were from France, by 1905 the proportion of French arms had risen to two-fifths. M. Goguyer, a local French merchant, who has from time to time lent large sums of money to the Sultan, is known to he deeply involved in the arms traffic. Another French merchant, M. Caraealla, was reported in July 1906 to have arrived at Muscat, with the apparent intention of taking part in the trade. In the returns for 1906-7 Belgium appears [2878 5—1] BGoveru- ment of India’s letter of February 10 , 1898 . India Office to Foreign Office, October 19, 1898 .

Govern ment of India’s letter of Februarv 21 , 1907 . for the first time as an importer of arms into Muscat, though it is believed that rifles of Belgian manufacture have for many years past been imported in considerable numbers. In 1897 the Government of India determined to make an effort to check the arms traffic at Muscat, and, accordingly, in January 1898 joint representations were made to the Sultan by the British and Persian Governments, urging him to co-operate in the suppression of the traffic. His Highness fell in with the sus^estion 'and on the 13th January of that year issued ( 1 ) a Notification warning his subjects that the importation of arms and ammunition into India and Persia was illegal; and ( 2 ) a Proclamation authorizing British and Persian vessels of war to search, within Muscat territorial waters, vessels carrying the British, Persian, or Muscat flag, as well as Muscat vessels in Indian and Persian waters, and to confiscate arms and ammuni tion intended for Indian and Persian ports. The right of search does not extend to the vessels of other nations, and, as has been stated above, the terms of his Commercial Treaties render it impossible for the Sultan, without the consent of the Treaty Powers, to impose any general restriction on the import of arms into Muscat. In the same year, 1898, with a view to imposing a further check on the arms traffic in Oman, rules were issued requiring all British subjects possessing arms within the Sultan’s territory to register the same at the British Consulate. It may be doubted, however, whether this measure has done more than throw the trade to an increasing extent into foreign hands. In the same way it seems not unlikely that the action recently taken by the British India Steam Navigation Company to check the smuggling of arms in small quantities by the Company’s steamers in the Gulf may only result in diverting traffic of this kind to vessels which are not placed under such restrictions.* It may be added that the import of arms at Gwadur, the Sultan of Muscat’s dependency on the Mekran coast, was prohibited by a Proclamation issued by His Highness on the 3rd March, 1891. In March 1901, the Government of India proposed that the terms of the Muscat Proclamation of 1898 should be extended so as to cover the export of arms to Turkish ports, and to the territories of the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit, and of the Trucial Chiefs, as well as to &lt;£ Indian and Persian” ports, which already fell within the scope of the Proclamation. This proposal was not carried into effect, it being at the time held undesirable, in view of the Sheikh’s position in regard to the warfare in iCentral Arabia,- to impose any fresh restrictions on the importation of arms at fKoweit. The necessary arrangements with Turkey also presented some difficulty. The Government of India have also from time to time recommended— ( 1 .) That the French Government should be approached with a view to their being induced to agree to the total prohibition of the arms traffic at Muscat; and ( 2 .) That the Porte should be asked to agree to our patrolling the Turkish littoral against arms smugglers, or at least to declare the illegality of the traffic. Neither of these suggestions has hitherto borne fruit. The question was passed in review by the Government of India as recently as February 1907, and the conclusion at which they arrived, after a careful and detailed examination of the case, was that the aims traffic would continue to flourish and increase until an Agreement with France was arrived at, and a complete prohibition was enforced against the importation of arms and ammunition into the territories of the Sultan of Muscat. The whole question will come up for discussion at the forthcoming International Conference at Brussels. Tnder the Brussels Act of 1890 for regulating the traffic in arms, any one of the Signatory Powers that has occasion to authorize such traffic in territories of its own lying within the region affected by the provisions of the Act, is required to establish a “public warehouse,” under the control of its local Administration, in which all imported arms must be deposited, and from which they mav not be withdrawn without the previous authorization of the Administration. There seems no hope of obtaining the consent of France, and the other Powers having Treaty relations with Muscat, to the Sultan’s prohibiting, proprio motv, the import of arms into his dominions. The only remedv for the present evil would * See below, under Koweit.therefore, appear to be to bring Muscat, at the forthcoming Conference, within the scope of the Brussels Act of 1890, and to enforce there the provisions requiring the estabdsr.ment of a warehouse under proper supervision. If this is done, two questions will arise:— (e.) hat inducement shall be offered to the Sultan, a Sovereign whose indepen- dence has been guaranteed by Great Britain and France, to accept restrictions on a w traffic amounting to 112,338/. • per annum, and yielding a customs revenue of *5,617£r per annum ? (fr.) How will it be possible to provide efficient machinery for carrying out the provisions of the Act, without admitting a system of international control inconsistent with the maintenance of the present political predominance of Great Britain ? The control of the arms traffic would presumably be vested in the Sultan’s Customs Department. There is thus afforded an additional argument in favour of the Government of India’s proposals,! renewed during the present year, that they should acquire the control of the Customs Administration of Muscat, guaranteeing the Sultan a minimum income of 20,000 dollars per mensem (25,600/. per annum at the rate of exchange current in 1907). It has been suggested that a suitable compensation to the Sultan for the loss of income entailed by the prohibition of the arms traffic would be to double the present subsidy he receives from Indian revenues (5,760/. per annum), and to raise it gradually, as may be necessary, to 15,000/. per annum. It is to be feared that if other Powers contribute towards the compensation paid to His Highness, they will obtain a locus standi for interference in the Muscat Customs Administration, which would constitute a serious disturbance of the status quo. 2. Bahrein. —On the 30th April, 1898, the Sheikh of Bahrein, on the advice of the Resident in the Persian Gulf, agreed “ absolutely to prohibit the importation of arms into Bahrein territory or exportation therefrom ”; and to enforce the prohibition, he issued on the same day— ( 1 .) A Notification declaring that the import and export of arms into and from the Islands of Bahrein was absolutely forbidden, and that in future all arms and ammunition imported or exported would be seized and confiscated as property of the State. (2.) A Proclamation conferring on British and Persian vessels of war permission to search vessels carrying the British, Persian, or Bahrein flag in Bahrein territorial waters, as well as Bahrein vessels in Indian or Persian waters, and to confiscate all arms and ammunition (weapons of war) intended for Indian or Persian ports, or for the Islands of Bahrein. The effect of the prohibition at Bahrein was at once perceptible in the customs returns, the total value of the imports of arms and ammunition, which had amounted to 30,819/. in 1897, falling to 313/. in the following year. In October 1905 the Sheikh of Bahrein addressed a Memorial to the Government of India, in which, among other alleged grievances, he complained of the fact that he was ooliged to interdict the sale of arms, and was thereby deprived of an advantage enjoyed by all the Arab Chiefs along the Arabian coast. He was informed in reply, in May 1906, that the restriction on the importation of arms at Bahrein had first been imposed in 1895 by himself on his o^n initiative, and his attention was drawn to the measures he had himself spontaneously taken from time to time to stop the traffic. It was also pointed out to him that the Sheikh of Koweit and the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast had similarly prohibited the traffic of arms in their territory, and he was given to understand that the Government of India would not consider for a moment the possibility of cancelling or modifying the Agreement he had concluded with the British Govern ment on this point. There seems good reason to believe that a considerable amount of illicit arms traffic goes on at Bahrein. Writing in December 1906, Major Cox furnished evidence that the port was rapidly rising to importance as a centre of the trade. The business in arms there, hitherto confined to one dealer, had been taken over by a Company, two of the shareholders being friends of Sheikh Esa and opponents of customs reform. He added Hi at the business had been largely extended, and Bahrein was being used as a distribution centre for supplying Persia. * Value of im portsJ bf arms and ammunition in iy 06 - 7 ; b-fiMt. represents 6 per cent, (the amount of the customs duty'tit Muscat) on this sum. f See pp. 14 , 15 of Foreign Office Memorandum of the 12 th February, 1908 .

Koweit .—On the 24th May, 1900, the Sheikh of Koweit entered into an agree ment with the British Government, hy which he engaged ‘‘ absolutely to prohibit the importation of arms into Koweit or exportation therefrom.” To carry out this engagement he issued on the same day ( 1 ) a Notification declaring that “the importa tion of arms and ammunition into Koweit and the territory under my control, and the exportation of the same are absolutely prohibited.” and that “all arms and ammunition imported into any parts of Koweit territory, or exported therefrom, in future will he seized and confiscated;” ( 2 ) a Proclamation conferring on British and Persian vessels of war the right to search, in Koweit territorial waters, vessels carrying the British, Persian, or Koweit flag, as well as Koweit vessels in Indian and Persian waters; and to confiscate any arms and ammunition destined for Indian, Persian or Koweit ports. In spite of the above Notification little serious attempt has been made to check the import of arms into Koweit. In April 1904, at a time when tribal warfare was in full progress in the interior of Arabia, the Government of India pointed out that no arrangements had as yet been made with the Porte for the combined suppression of the traffic, and that the importation of arms was proceeding briskly. In view of the support rendered hy the Turks to Bin Rashid, Amir of Nejd, one of the warring Chiefs of the interior, the Government of India were anxious that no additional check should he imposed on the arms traffic at Koweit, which afforded the main source of supply to the rival Chieftain, Bin Saoud, Amir of the Wahabi. It was explained that this did not involve authorizing the Sheikh of Koweit to import arms, or even relaxing measures actually in force, but merely letting matters remain as they were. His Majesty’s Government accepted this view, and the Government of India were informed on the 24th June, 1904, that fresh measures for the prevention of the importation of arms at Koweit would for the present be deferred. The latest reports of the Political Agent at Koweit show that a large and increasing traffic in arms is being carried on at that port. Major Knox, in his Trade Report for 1906-7, drew attention to the large increase during the year in the value of the arms imported in country sailing-boats, and remarked that “the well-known dislike of the British authorities to this traffic, while it has had no effect in checking the import of arms and ammunition, has had the very unfortunate result of losing to a British Company (the British India Steam Navigation Company) the freight on 13 lakhs worth of goods.” Major Knox found it necessary in May 1906 to remind Sheikh Mubarak formally of his Arms Prohibition of 1900, and to request that it might be more strictly enforced. The Sheikh did not take the reminder in good part, and the Resident in the Persian Gulf gave his opinion that the question was one which might at any time endanger the good relations between the Sheikh and the Political Agent. Major Knox put the case still more strongly in a letter to the Resident. “ The Proclama tion,” he wrote on the 3rd July, 1906, “ is not worth the paper it is written on, and is only a cause of friction.” 4. Trucial Chiefs .—At the close of 1902 the Trucial Chiefs entered into engage ments respecting the arms traffic, similar to those of the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit. 5. Turkey .—The importation of arms and munitions of war of all kinds into Turkey was prohibited by an Imperial Decree which was notified to the British Embassy in Eebruary 1862. The orders issued under this Decree to the custom-house authorities were communicated to the British Embassy by the Ottoman Government on the 11 th Eebruary, 1863. They forbade absolutely the import into any part of the Ottoman Empire of all arms and ammunition, except “ les armes de chasse et de luxe, les armes blanches, tels que sabres, epees et couteaux, et la poudre de chasse en petite quantite, destines a I’usage prive”; and stated that all contraband articles would be confiscated by the State. On the 4th October, 1893, the Porte made a fresh communication to the Powers, inclosing the Regulations which had been accepted in the Turco-German Commercial Treaty just then concluded, and notifying them as those in force. The acceptance of these Regulations was not at the time considered opportune by Great Britain and the other Powers, but it would seem that, nevertheless, the Turkish Govern ment continued to regard the Regulations as those in force in the Ottoman dominions.In then- despatch of the 30th July, 1903, the Government of India recommended that an endeavour should be made to come to an arrangement with Turkey permdtmg vessels under the Turkish flag to be searched for arms by British shins of war, or failing this that the Porte should be asked to notify formally to ffi, Majesty s Government that the importation of arms into Ottoman dominions without special licence was prohibited. r S ![ I J-. 0 ’ Co “ 01 ’ T' 11 ',’ was con f ul 1 te&lt;1 « le matter, drew attention to the notifica tions that had already been made by the Turkish Government, and suggested that they might sufficiently serve the purpose the Government of India had in view As regards the right of search, Minister of Foreign Affairs, willing enough to co-operate but that the right to search Sir N O’Conor wrote “ In conversation with the I gathered that the Turkish Government would be in our endeavours to suppress the traffic in arms, uikish vessels could only be conceded in exchange Govern ment of India’s letter of July d0, 1003.

O’Conor to Lord Lans- downe, N c veinber 16, 1903. for a reciprocal privilege ; an arrangement which, however one-sided it might prove in practice, would, m principle, be open to obvious objections.” 6 . Persia.—In 1881 the Persian Government issued a Decree that “no arms or munitions of war, such as guns, caps, gunpowder, &amp;c., should enter Persian territory without the permission of the Great Government” In announcing the issue of this Decree to the British Legation, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote as follows on the 3rd July, 1881: “Since the right of purchasing 'arms and introducing the same into Persia belongs to the Persian Government, who exercise it through their own specially appointed officials, and if this absolute right were not exclusively confined to the Government, and everybody who thought lit to do so were allowed to purchase such articles and introduce them into the country, this great governmental privilege would become obsolete, and considerable evils would result to the State. Therefore His Majesty the Shah has issued orders that no one shall import arms of any description whatsoever into this country from abroad, and any person in whose possession arms of foreign make are found will be liable to have them confiscated by Government.” As regards the measures taken by the Persian authorities to enforce the Decree of 1881, it may be noted that in May 1891 both the Shah himself and the Amin-es- Sultan telegraphed to the Governor of Bushire complaining of the sale in Tehran of arms by British and Parsee merchants, and giving strict orders that the prohibition on imports should be maintained, and all arms imported should be confiscated. In the year 1893 the local authorities seized seventeen cases of arms consigned to a Muscat firm, which were landed at Bushire for transhipment, on the ground that complaints had been received from the Turkish Government of arms being smuggled from Persian territory. The goods were confiscated. In the year 1895 the British steamer “Zulu” landed by mistake at the Bushire custom-house several cases of arms consigned to Muscat; these were seized by the local authorities. In January 1897, while the “Zulu” case was still pending, the first preventive officer was appointed at Bushire by the Persian Government. Apart from these incidents, there is nothing to show that effective measures were taken to prevent the smuggling of arms, and on the 15th April, 1898, Sir M. Durand, in a despatch to Lord Salisbury, admitted that there could be “little doubt that a considerable illicit import of arms into Persia is being carried on, and that European firms are not wholly unconcerned in it.” At the close of 1897, as a result of British pressure, the Persian Government agreed that “ in addition to such measures as may be taken by Persian officials, Her Majesty’s ships should examine and search all merchant-vessels trading in the Persian bull, and confiscate and hand over to the Persian Government all prohibited arms tound on board.” The Grand Vizier’s note of the 18th December, 1897, in which this Agreement was embodied, further stated that the Persian Government was ready “to join with Her Majesty’s Government in requesting the Sultan of Muscat h&gt; notify in the ports and territories of Muscat that arms should not be imported hom that side into Persia or Hindustan, also that English ships should exercise m regard to search and confiscation the same rights in Muscat as in Persian waters” I he joint representations to the Sultan were successful, and it was owing to the conclusion of an Agreement with Muscat that Her Majesty’s ship “Lapwing” was able, on the 24th January, 1898, to seize the steamer “ Baluchistan,” near Muscat, and capture the cargo of arms she was carrying. An action was brought hy Messrs. Fracis, Times and -Co., who had shipped a consignment of arms by the “ Baluchistan,” against the Sea Insurance Company, Limited, to recover a loss under [2878 s— 1 ] C Mr Thom son to Lord Granville, July 12, 1881.

Mr. Justice Pigham, in giving judgment for the plaintiffs, held that “ the import of arms was not illegal according to the law of Persia, as that law was administered in practice and enjoined,” or, in other words, that no real prohibition existed on the importation of arms into Lersian poits. As regards the legality of the act of seizure, the question was determined by the further action brought by Messrs. Fracis, Times and Co. against Captain Carr, E.N., the officer who 'had seized the “ Baluchistan,” for wrongful deprivation of property. Mr. Justice Grantham, who tried the case in the first instance, found for the defendant, and his judgment, after being reversed by the Court of Appeal, was finally upheld by the House of Fords, on the ground that the seizure had taken place in Muscat territorial waters, and was, under the Sultans Proclamation of January 1898, justifiable according to the law of Muscat. On the 1st January, 1900, the Shah promulgated a law reaffirming the prohi bition against the importation into Persia of arms and ammunition, as well as various other commodities. The case of the British steamer Hathor, on board of which arms were seized at Bushire in November 1900, led to an Order in Council being issued, on the recommendation of the Law Officers of the Crown, by which the Persian Law of the 1st January, 1900, was made applicable to British subjects, in so far as the provisions respecting arms and ammunition were concerned. It may be said generally that the efforts of the Persian authorities to put down the traffic have been quite ineffectual. e£ Possibly, wrote Mr. Grant Huff in July 1906, “ when M. Naus has received the launches, now building for the Persian Government at Bombay ” (since supplied) “ something may be done by the Belgian officials to check the arms traffic. But there is no present likelihood of the Persian Government taking the slightest trouble to put an end to it. Even if they desired to do so, I doubt if they have the power.” The Government of India have done their best to check the trade at the Persian ports. In 1900 a Vice-Consul was appointed to Bunder Abbas, where “ it was hoped that the presence of a British officer might lead to the display of greater vigour in the repression of the illicit importation of arms along the neighbouring portions of the Persian coast.” In 1902 measures were concerted with the Persian Governor- General of Mekran to prevent the importation of arms into Persian Baluchistan, and to impose restrictions on their possession in that province. A further Conference on the subject took place between the Persian officials on the Mekran border and the British frontier officers in 1906, and the desire to cope with the illegal traffic in arms was one of the reasons which led, in the same year, to the temporary appoint ment of Lieutenant G. H. Ogilvie as Vice-Consul at Bam. But the nature of the country is such that, once the consignments are landed and clear of the coast, it is virtually impossible to catch the caravans conveying them into the interior. This view is confirmed by the Beport furnished by Lieutenant Ogilvie, who travelled through Persian Baluchistan in June 1906 on his way to take up his duties at Bam. He said that the local Persian authorities were quite incapable of dealing with the traffic, and that the Afghans employed in smuggling arms up country from the coast were invariably well armed, and could overcome any opposition offered to them with the greatest ease ; and he explained in a later Report that “ the communications in Baluchistan are so unspeakably bad that large caravans, when once they have left the coast, can travel without any fear of inter ference, even if such interference were contemplated by the authorities, and with the utmost secrecy.” It may be added that the Sirdars of Persian Baluchistan are not bevond the suspicion of having a pecuniary interest in the trade. As recently as November 1907 further measures were introduced by the Govern ment of India, at the suggestion of Mr. New, of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, for dealing with the arms traffic on the Mekran coast. These measures included the creation of a small corps of camel sowars to patrol the coast between Jask and Chahbar, in order to collect information about the movements of Afghans, expected consignments of arms, &amp;c., which they wdll communicate without delay to British ships engaged in the suppression of the trade. How far these measures will be successful remains to be seen. For the present the situation may be summarized in the words used by the Government of India in •jWWS 1 Wain i| fjj ^their despatch of the 21 st February, 1007. “We regard it as certain,” they wrote, “that effective action for the suppression of the arms trade cannot be taken by the Persian authorities. On the coast, the Belgian Customs officials are few in number, and although, perhaps, willing to give assistance for the suppressiorf of the traffic, they have not the means at their disposal really to take efficient measures to deal with the evil. Inland, as is well known, the Persian authorities are powerless outside the towns, and large caravans can travel by unfrequented routes without the slightest risk of interference.” Govern ment of India’s letter of February 21 , 1907 . W.—Quarantine, (Communicated by the India Office.) A. “The sanitary defence of the Persian Gulf,” wrote Dr. Theodore Thomson in his Report of the 12th July, 1906, “has in the past received, and still continues to receive, considerable attention, not only in the interests of countries adjacent thereto, hut also because it is maintained by some authorities that cholera and plague are particularly likely to invade these regions by reason of their nearness to, and frequent communication with, India, and thence to extend over-land to Europe. This view was voiced by M. Barr&amp;re, one of the French Delegates at the Inter national Sanitary Conference of 1897, when he classified the Persian Gulf, along with the Bed Sea, as the ‘ routes naturelles des maladies pestifentielles.’ In relation with this aspect of the matter the question of what measures should be adopted with a view to guarding against the suggested danger to Europe was discussed at the International Sanitary Conferences of 1891, 1897, and 1903; and in each of the Con ventions drawn up at these Conferences clauses were incorporated embodying measures intended to secure this end.” Stated briefly, the Begulations framed under the Paris Convention of 1894, which had special reference to cholera, have in the main been a dead letter. The Regulations contemplated the establishment of a number of sanitary stations, under the control of the Turkish authorities, in the Persian Gulf, and the enforcement of quarantine against arrivals. The British Government, in adhering to the Convention, refused to accept the Appendix containing the Persian Gulf Begulations, on the grounds (1) that the posts were unnecessary; (2) that Turkey and Persia were too far off to maintain effective control; and ( 3 ) that the great expense entailed m establishing the ports would fall chiefly on British shipping, which formed 98 pei cent, of the shipping in the Gulf. The scheme was not carried out. When plague appeared in India in 1896 the Constantinople Board of Health discussed at great length and on repeated occasions the question of new ports and t ic regime to he applied in the Gulf ports. It was ultimately decided to establish a permanent port at Fao, and to repulse plague-infected ships from Bussorah. A om- mission was sent to Fao to select a site, but nothing further was done, and H ao remained a sanitary office with no lazaret and no sanitary apparatus. . In the Venice Sanitary Convention of 1897 provision was made simply for a sanitary station near Bussorah and another at or in the neighbourhood o ie s an of Ormuz or of Kishm, near the entrance of the Gulf, these stations o e uncer the control of the Constantinople Board of Health. r The establishment o le imuz station was to be subject to an agreement between Turkey and Persia. e ^ .! an authorities objected to the proposed station at Ormuz on political giouncs, 10 in r , that it would give the maritime control of the Persian Gulf to Turkey, anc mig i^ become a means of harassing British shipping. the proposals were, ovieyn, accepted by the British Government, and Persia also ratified the Convention, subject to the reservation that the station at the entrance of the Gulf shou c oe unc er * This is a body of international composition, Great _ Britain being represented on it by Clemow, Physician to His Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople.

The provisions of the Venice Conven tion, in so far as they relate to the Persian Gulf, have remained, like those of the 1894 Convention, a dead letter. No lazaret was established at the entrance of the Gulf, and the Bussofah lazaret remained, to quote the words of Dr. Clemow, the sole and very imperfect quarantine station in those regions.” The Paris Sanitary Convention of 1903, which was ratified in April 1907, provides for the Bussorah station as before, and for a sanitary station at Ormuz, both to he under the contr.)! of the Constantinople Board of Health. The Convention was signed by the British Delegates, subject to reservations which, it was hoped, would result in the abandonment of the Ormuz scheme. These reservations were (1) that the establishment of the Ormuz station should be deferred until the Board of Health had been reformed in the manner provided by the Convention; (2) that nothing should be done to carry out the scheme until the Mixed Commission, on which we, with other European Powers are represented, should have unanimously voted the necessary funds. Doubts were at the same time expressed by His Majesty’s Govern ment, through the British Delegates, a« to the necessity for a station near the entrance of the Gulf, which was not proved by the experience of recent years, and as to the suitability of Ormuz, with its unhealthy climate, as a site for tiie purpose proposed. The Persian Government made a further proposal, in the form of a Declaration Additionnelle to the Paris Convention, that the station at the mouth of the Gulf should be controlled by Persia, and should be placed on the Island of Henjam instead of Ormuz. In this connection Dr. Eaivre was sent by the Erench Government in the early part of 1905 to the Persian Gulf, to ascertain and report whether the Island of Henjam would or would not be more suitable as a site for a “sentinel” station near the entrance of the Gulf than the Island of Ormuz. He reported in Septembei* 1905. Stated briefly, his recommendations, which went beyond the terms of his reference and dealt with the whole question of the sanitary defence of the Gulf, were as follows :— 1. That lazarets should be established at Henjam and Eao, to be controlled respectively by the Persian Government and by the Constantinople Board of Health ; and 2. That sanitary stations for purposes of “observation” should be erected at Bunder Abbas, Lingah, Bushire, and Mohammerah, under the control of the Persian Government, and at Bussorah, Koweit, Bahrein, Debai, and Muscat, under the control of the Constantinople Board of Health. Dr. Eaivre’s Report did not reach His Majesty’s Government until December 1906. In the meanwhile it had been decided in November 1905 that Dr. Theodore Thomson, of the Local Government Board, should visit the Persian Gulf on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, and report “ on the sanitary requirements of those regions in respect, not only oi Persia, but also of Europe, as well as on the question of the need of a sanitary station and the suitability of Ormuz, Henjam, or other sites for the purpose.” The Government of India, who were consulted as to the proposal, agreed that it might be advantageous at any future discussions for the British Government to have at its disposal expert information independent of that collected by Dr. Eaivre, but expressed the earnest hope that “ British opposition to establishment of sanitary station will be uncompromisingly maintained.” It may here be noted that the objec tions of the British Government to the establishment of an international sanitary station in the Persian Gulf, as classified by the Eoreign Office in April 1906, are (1) political, in so far as the station would introduce a certain amount of international control in a sphere ot British influence; (2) commercial, as placing within the reach of other Powers a ready means of hampering and restricting the shipping trade with Bombay and Kurrachee, against which a lair pretext for quarantine can always be found, and through which the bulk of English as well as the whole of Indian trade with Persia; (3) sanitary, it being considered that the proposed station, far from acting as a check upon disease, would serve rather to spread that insalubrity which it would be destined to prevent, by subjecting the crews and passengers on the vessels detained, the large majority of which would be British, to the dangers of a pernicious climate and unhealthy surroundings. Dr. Thomson left for India, on his way to the Gulf, in January 1906. His Report, which will be discussed hereafter, was submitted in the following July.e ll U|l iTjj 'lli' k Hfal othijj edit 'Oyen. say it ami is t|)« fffuliti .eiji I of I Gil, mM rd of edaf triii itrol BSOD, iDsi need itarf The terms of the Persian “Declaration Additionnelle” to the 1903 Convention • (viz. (1) that the station to he established at the entrance of the Gulf in accordance with the Venice Convention of 1897 should be under Persian, and not international, control; and (’2) that it should be placed on the Island of Henjam, and not Ormuz) were communicated by the Prench Government to the British Ambassador at Paris in December 1905, with an intimation that the Persian proposals were favourably viewed by them. These proposals did not commend themselves to the British % Government, partly on the ground that any such arrangement would defeat the object ’ of the British reserves, viz., the postponement of the scheme for a station at’the entrance of the Gulf, and partly because they doubted the ability of the Persian authorities to provide the necessary funds for the purpose.* In regard to this latter point, Mr. Grant Duff, writing from Tehran on the 15th November, 1905, said that he did not think “ there is the slightest prospect of the provisions of the Convention, or any other sanitary measures, being carried out, except in those ports where the quarantine arrangements are under European control, so long as Persia remains under its present Government,” The Prench Government, however, continued to press the , point, and in support of the Persian proposals stated that Dr. Paivre (whose Report His Majesty’s Government had not yet seen) had pronounced in favour of Henjam, ^ the island chosen by the Persian Government, as being a suitable position for the station, while, at the same time, they pointed out that it would be difficult for them to explain to Persia that one of the reasons for which Great Britain had decided not to accept the Persian proposal was the incapacity of the Persian Treasury to bear the expenses. It was also urged that, if the Persian offer were declined, Persia might refuse to ratify the Paris Convention or make her ratification conditional on reserves, which would cause still further delay in bringing the Convention into operation. At this stage of the discussion Dr. Thomson’s Report reached the hands of His Majesty’s Government in July 1906. Its general conclusions were opposed to the creation of a sanitary station at the entrance to the Gulf, (1) because it still remained to be proved that epidemics had been conveyed to Europe by that route ; (2) because a sanitary station at that point would be ineffective, inasmuch as it would be evaded by native sailing craft, the most dangerous class of shipping; and (3) because no suitable position could be found for such a station, Henjam, though upon the whole the most suitable site in other respects, being open to serious objections on account of its climate, its inadequate water supply, and its lack of provisions. Dr. Thomson’s own recommendations were summarized as follows at the close of his Report:— “ In substance, therefore, the scheme best adapted, in the circumstances, to secure a reason able degree of protection to Europe and the minimum of interference with commercial interests in the Gulf of Persia consists in the perfecting of the present sanitary stations at Mohammerah and Bushire,t the establishment of a sanitary station at Koweit, and the creation of a new station in place of that now existing at Bussorah. Sanitary defence of the Gulf based on these lines will afford a greater degree of protection to Europe against plague and cholera than would be secured by a ‘ sentinel station ’ near the entrance of the Gulf, combined with a terminal station at Bussorah, and will not impose on shipping the unnecessary and prejudicial restrictions that would result from the latter scheme. “If thi%,view should meet with acceptance, I would urge that steps should be taken to pnt the scheme I have suggested in operation with all possible speed. I view the alter native ‘sentinel station' project with apprehension, as calculated to be^ ineffective, expensive, and gravely detrimental to commercial interests—and these are mainly British m the Gu . Abandonment of this ‘sentinel station’ project is much more likely to follow on knowledge that defensive measures, of the kind and at the places I have indicated, are m actual operation than on mere announcement that such measures are in contemplation. lOBw , the trite , ways | idiaB I . far ) brity ■s on | gers ; Hte Dr. Thomson’s views as to the “ sentinel station were adopted by His Majesty s Glovernment, and the Erench Government were informed that the Persian proposals were inacceptable, a decision which was in due course communicated to leisiaanc to the other parties to the Convention. * In his despatch of the 27th April, 1906 , to Sir F.

Sir C. Spring-Rice at the end of 1906 explained the position to Dr. Schneider, Spring--Rice p re sident of the Tehran Sanitary Council,* who promised to do his best to prevent GreyJ ’ question being again raised. Dr. Schneider observed, however, that it would January greatly facilitate his task, should the matter he brought before the Sanitary Council, 1,1907. if the Government of India would consent to improve the conditions under which quarantine measures were at present carried out in the Gulf, i.e., by increasing the European personnel and by supplying disinfection stoves and rat-destroying apparatus at each of the five ports (viz., Mohammerah, Bushire, Lingah, Bunder Abbas, and Jask), instead of at Bushire only. Dr. Schneider added that the Persian Government had not the necessary funds at their disposal, and that the expense would necessarily fall on the Indian Government. j B.

It will he convenient at this stage to give a brief account of the quarantine system hitherto administered in the Persian Gulf by officers of the Indian Government. In September 1901 Major Cox, after examining the old records regarding the sanitary control in the Persian Gulf, reported that “ since 1864, and probably before, it has been entirely in our hands; but our control seems to have come into existence auto matically, and I can trace no original arrangements with the Persian Government.” The appearance of plague at Bombay in the autumn of 1896 rendered it imperative to adopt quarantine precautions in the Gulf. The resources of the Persian Government were unequal to the inauguration of adequate measures, and the task was, with the consent and at the desire of the Persian Government, undertaken by the British Residency at Bushire. After some difficulty, quarantine was placed on satisfactory and efficient footing at Bunder Abbas, Lingah, and Mohammerah, for which the services of assistant surgeons were lent by the Government of India, as well as at Bushire. In August 1903 the Government of India reported that three assistant surgeons were euqhoyed exclusively on quarantine duties at Mohammerah, Bunder Abbas, and Lingah, while at Bushire and Jask the duty was done by the assistant surgeons attached to the Residency and the telegraph station respectively. The cost of the quarantine establishment at the fmd three ports, estimated at 1,480 rupees a-month (1,184Z. per annum) was borne by the Persian Government, Avhile a charge of about 340 rupees a-month (272/. per annum) fell upon Indian revenues in respect of the quarantine duties discharged by the doctors at Jask and Bushire. The assistant surgeons were placed under the immediate orders of the Residency Surgeon at Bushire, who was in the executive charge of the quarantine arrangements. Einancially, control was vested in the Customs Administration, to whom all fees were made over by the quarantine officials. Attempts have from time to time been made to undermine the position of the British Quarantine Administration. On the 6th August, 1903, Sir A. Hardinge telegraphed that the Russians were pressing the Persian Government to take the Gulf quarantine arrangements out of the hands of the British doctors and to place them under the Belgian Customs Department. Six days later the Government of India telegraphed that they .had “ positive proof ” that the Persian (government intended to carry out this suggestion, and recommended that the “ strongest protest should be made against a change so injurious to British interests,” and that His Majesty’s Government should resolutely resist the “ principle that quarantine arrange ments in the Gulf can he subverted, without our knowledge or consent, or that a body of foreigners can be put in expressly to hamper British trade, the tonnage of which is over 90 per cent, of the total.” The Persian Government, on being approached by Sir A. Hardinge, disclaimed all intention of removing the British doctors; but the British Minister was informed by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs that certain complaints against the manner in which they administered the quarantine “ had suggested to the Shah the idea that it might be advisable to establish some closer supervision over their work.” The question was again raised in February 1904 by Colonel Kemball’s complaints of interference by the Customs Department in the executive work of the quarantine. The Government of India recommended “ that a vigorous protest should at once he made against the disturbance of existing sanitary * This body was instituted by the Shah in 1904 as a result of the cholera panic.

Its functions are purely advisory, and it has neither funds nor executive of any sort under its control.arrangements/’ but Sir A. Hardinge preferred to reserve any strong remonstrance until we were confronted with some definite act of encroachment bv the Persian Government itself. Further interference on the part of the Customs authorities, coupled with the activity of M. Bussiere, a doctor in the employ of the Customs Department, and attached to the Drench Vice-Consulate, and also, as subsequently appeared, to the Russian Consulate, at Bushire, again raised the question in an acute form. Repre sentations were made by Sir A. Hardinge to the Persian Government and to M. Nans, the Head of the Persian Customs, with the result that in September 1901 the Grand Vizier promised to send telegraphic orders to Bushire that the Custom-house officers should abstain from interfering in the quarantine administration of the Gulf ports. The actual text of the instructions sent to the Director-General of Customs, Bushire, was as follows: “You are to abstain as far as possible from all interference with quarantine. Recommend this especially to Bussidre. At the same time this does not deprive you of the right to report to Tehran any steps by the quarantine officials which may be prejudicial to the Persian Government.” The Grand Vizier told Sir A. Hardinge at the same time that he proposed to reopen the question on M. Nans’ return from leave. Nothing further was done, however, and the settlement of the case remained for the time being undisturbed. Arising out of these incidents, Sir A. Hardinge, in a despatch dated the 16th August, 1901, proposed that, in order to strengthen our position, the Govern ment of India should decide “ (1) itself to pay the salaries of the Indian doctors in the Gulf ports; and (2) to depute for these duties European rather than, as at present, native Indian assistant surgeons.” The Government of India doubted the advantage of raising the former point, unless it was pressed by the Persian Govern ment ; they considered, moreover, that the “ delegation of quarantine functions to British-paid officials seems to involve greater derogation from Shah’s dignity than employment of British officers paid by Persian Government.” The latter recom mendation, however, was accepted, and the Government of India telegraphed, on the 31st December, 1901, that steps were being taken to provide “ suitable Europeans to replace the present assistant surgeons at Mohammerah and Bunder Abbas as soon as possible,” and that it was also proposed “ to carry out a like change at other ports in the Persian Gulf if suitable men can be obtained.” In March 1905 the Government of India were able to report that the necessary measures had been taken in regard to Mohammerah and Bunder Abbas, and that arrangements were being made for similar action in respect of the other ports. During the year 1906 the question was again to the front. In the middle of September the Darya Begi, Governor of the Persian Gulf, wrote to the Presidency Surgeon at Bushire, in his capacity as Chief Quarantine Officer for the Persian Gulf, informing him that the Persian Government would require the Persian flag, as well as the quarantine flag, to be flown, not only on all boats employed in quarantine work, but also on all ships undergoing quarantine in Persian ports. This step w r as believed to be the outcome of the action of the Russian Consul-General, who had informed the Darya Begi that Russian vessels would, in future, recognize no quarantine authority unless covered by tbe Persian flag, and that no correspondence would be carried on with the quarantine authorities in English, but only in Persian or French. A similar communication was made by the German Consul. JNegotia- tions took place between tbe British Eegation and the Persian Government, with the result that the latter tacitly dropped the requirement that ships in quarantine should fly the Persian flag, on finding that it urns contrary to the general practice in other countries. They showed a disposition, however, to maintain their attitude as regards the flying of the Persian flag by boats engaged in quarantine duties. In December 1906 the Russian ship “ Trouvor ” refused, on the advice of the Russian Consulate, to admit the quarantine officer on board at Bunder Abbas to carry out the inspection laid down by the Venice Convention. The same thing occurred^ a Lingah, but at Bushire the “Trouvor” fulfilled the usual formalities. The Russian Minister at Tehran at first attempted to argue that the conduct of M. Ovseen vo, the Russian Consul at Bunder Abbas, was perfectly correct, but he finally agreed o send a telegram to M. Ovseenko enjoining a general compliance with the quarantme rules. Eventually it was settled between the British and Russian Ministers that the question should be disposed of by the Tehran Sanitary Council, and, on her return to Bunder Abbas the “ Trouvor” accepted the inspection of the Sanitary Officer. Further instances of interference on the part of M. Ovseenko occuire m March 1907, in connection with tbe British steamer “ Madura ” and the Russian steamer “ Euphrates.” Sir A.

In his despatch of the 1st January, 1907, reporting conversations with the President of the Tehran Sanitary Council, the British Minister at Tehran (Sir C. Spring-Rice) recommended that Dr. Schneider’s suggestions for the increase of the European personnel and the improvement of the apparatus of the quarantine stations in the Gulf should be submitted to the Government of India for their consideration. These proposals, it may be noted, went somewhat beyond those made by Dr. Theodore Thomson in his Report of 12th July, 1909, inasmuch as Dr. Schneider contemplated improvements at all five of the Gulf ports, whereas Dr. Thomson’s recommendations, so far as the coast of Persia was concerned,^ were limited to perfecting the existing sanitary stations at Mohammerah and Bushire, and possibly improving the station at Bunder Abbas. The Government of India, in a telegram dated the 6th Eebruary, 1907, expressed their agreement with Dr. Thomson’s recommendations, and their willingness “ to bear, for the present, the cost of necessary preliminary measures, including supply of disaffecting apparatus at Gulf ports, reserving right of subsequent recovery from the Persian Government in case of Persian ports, and subject, in the case of Koweit, to acquiescence of Sheikh in proposed arrangement.” In April 1907 the British Minister at Tehran telegraphed that an attack might shortly he anticipated upon our control of the quarantine in Southern Persia, and that he trusted that steps would be taken to secure the maintenance of existing arrangements. He subsequently explained that his apprehensions were based upon (1) the impending retirement of the President of the Tehran Sanitary Council, who was friendly to British interests, and the possibility of his being replaced by some one hostile; and (2) the frank hostility shown towards our quarantine officers both by the Russian Consul at Bunder Abbas and by the Belgian Customs officials. Sir C. Spring-Rice recommended, in addition to the improvements of the sanitary service on the lines indicated in bis despatch of the 1st January, that a communication should be made to the Russian Government to the effect that, in view (1) of the predominance of British trade and shipping; (2) of the impossibility of securing an efficient Persian service ; and (3) of the necessity for good administration, His Majesty’s Government expected that the Russian Government would offer no objection to the continuance of the present system. His Majesty’s Government decided to postpone making any representations to the Russian Government until the estimates of the cost of the proposed improvements had been received from the Government of India. The outbreak of plague at Bahrein in April 1907 brought into notice the deficiency in the disinfecting equipment of the southern ports, and lent additional urgency to the question of improving the sanitary defence of the Gulf. With a despatch dated the 19th May, 1907, Sir C. Spring-Rice transmitted a Memorandum by Dr. Schneider, President of the Tehran Sanitary Council, on the measures he recommended for the improvement of the quarantine service. These measures included the appointment of commissioned officers of the medical service to all five ports, and the provision of a stove and Clayton apparatus (for destroying rats, &amp;c.), as well as a reserve stove, at Bushire. Sir C. Spring-Rice added, in a telegram dated the 30th May, that the Sanitary Council, while strongly approving the measures proposed, did not possess the necessary personnel, appliances, or funds to carry out the scheme, and would be very grateful for the assistance of the Government of India. Sir C. Spring-Rice expressed himself strongly in favour of the proposed improvements being undertaken by the British Government, and in this view the Foreign Office concurred, the following statement of policy being made in Mr. Mallet’s letter of the 21st June, 1907 :— “ During the eleven years in which the control of quarantine arrangements in the Gulf has been in British hands, the Government of India have spent large sums on the service, which would be entirely lost if any change in tbe control were now to be made ; and Sir E. Grey entirely agrees with His Majesty’s Minister in considering it of great importance, both politically and commercially, to endeavour to maintain the status quo by improving the efficiency of the medical service.” In July 1907 the Sanitary Council reported in favour of an extended scheme of improvement including sanitary stations at Bunder Abbas, Bushire, Mohammerah, Jask, and Lingah, with a mobile service under a European doctor. The Russian * * Dr. Thomson also proposed the establishment of a station at Koweit, on the Arabian side of the Gulf.representative on the Council proposed that the sanitary service should be in “ strict collaboration with the Customs,” who should use the live small steamers they had recently acquired; he also desired the appointment of the Erench doctor of the Russian Consulate at Bushire as Inspector-General. Representations were made to the Russian Government, on the 24th July, in which it was pointed out that His Majesty’s Government considered “ the present quarantine arrangements as one of their special interests in the Persian Gulf and a part of the status quo” On the 27th July the Russian Minister at Tehran assured Sir C. Spring-Rice that the proposal of the Russian doctor had been made without his knowledge, and that care would be taken to prevent the recurrence of a similar incident. On the 7th November, 1907, the following measures were actually sanctioned by Mr. Morley His Majesty’s Government* ment°of rn ' 1. The provision of four stoves at Jask, Bunder Abbas, Lingah, and Mohammerak, November under the charge of the present assistant surgeons; and of one stove at Bahrein 7 . 1907 / under a military assistant surgeon, to be appointed on a salary of 208/. per annum. The initial cost of the five stoves was estimated at 1,250/., and the annual recurring expenditure on them at about 333/. 2. The provision of a Clayton apparatus at Bushire, at an initial cost of 1,000/. 3. The appointment of a mobile assistant, of the Indian Medical Service, at Bushire, at a cost of 560/. per annum. The total estimated cost was : 2,250/. initial; 1,100/. recurring. On the 4th January, 1908, the purchase of a portable stove for the mobile assistant was sanctioned, at a maximum cost of 40/. The whole of this expenditure is to be shared equally between the Indian and Imperial Exchequers. The sanctioned strength of the Quarantine Establishment in the Persian Gulf thus works out as follows : — At Bushire. Paid by the British Government — One Residency surgeon (in executive chargeof the Quarantine Service).i One mobile assistant (of the Indian Medical Service). One assistant surgeon (in sub-charge of Residency dispensary, stove, &amp;c.). At other Ports. Paid by the Persian Government — One assistant surgeon at Bunder Abbas. „ „ Lingah. ,, „ Mohammerah. Paid by the British Government — One assistant surgeon at Bahrein. At Koweit the assistant surgeon attached to the British Agency was empoweied by the Sheikh in May 1907 to carry out the necessary measures for imposing quarantine on arrivals from Bahrein. Bahrein was declared free of plague in the following July. III .—Question of British Consular Representation in El Hasa and Katif. (Communicated by the India Office.) The question of British Consular representation in El Hasa and K^Jif v as raised Ooveru by the Government of India in 1904. In a despatch dated the 31s arc o 1 a j ndia , g j year, Lord Ourzon’s Government represented that the Indian merchan s o a irem, i e tter of trading with the mainland, were subjected to many vexatious restrictions by the March 31 , Turkish Customs farmer, and that official regulations at the Katif cus om- louse ia( * * At Jask the quarantine duties are discharged by the assistant surgeon attached to the Easto telegraph Department station.

It was pointed out, in illustration, that the Bania, community of Katif had, in 1900, been reduced from one of 70 or SO persons to a single tiader, and, fuither, that those still desirous of carrying on trade at the port had, in the same year, expressed their willingness to pay&gt; in advance, the cost of maintaining a British Agent to protect their interests on the spot. This request, it was added, was repeated during Lord Curzon’s visit to the Persian Gulf in 1903,when the British Indian merchants of Bahrein petitioned his Excellency for the appointment of a British Bepresentative to protect their interests at Katif. The Government of India accordingly recommended (1) that the Political Agent at Bahrein should be appointed Vice-Consul for El Hasa, and (2) that a Native Consular Agent should be stationed at Katif. Sir N. O’Conor, who was consulted, thought that these suggestions should not be pressed for the moment, and his view was accepted by His Majesty’s Government. In communicating this decision to the Government of India, Mr. Brodrick wrote as follows, in a despatch dated the 5th August, 1904“ It will be seen that His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, . . . . , having regard to the interpretation which the Turkish Government might place on the appointment of a Consular officer for El Hasa, and to the objection they would feel, at present, to recognizing such an officer, does not consider it advisable that effect should be given to the suggestion that the Political Officer at Bahrein should he invested with Vice-Consular jurisdiction over the Turkish district of El Hasa. Eor similar reasons, Sir N. O’Conor is of opinion that the present moment is unsuited for appointing a Native Consular Agent at Katif, and he suggests that the consideration of this proposal should be deferred till the result is seen of the representations which he has addressed to the Turkish Govern ment, in regard to the grievances of the Indian traders, which formed the subject of the Government of India’s letter of the 31st March, 1904. These views are approved by His Majesty’s Government.” In September 190 f the British Consul at Bussorah reported that the necessary instructions had been sent to the Mutessarif of Hasa, regarding the abatement of the excess duties at Katif, of which British Indians had complained; and Mr. Brodrick informed the Government of India, on the 20th December, 1904, that he had intimated to the Eoreign Office that, “ if practical effect is given to these orders, it will be unnecesary to press for the appointment of a Consular Agent at Katif.’ The question has not subsequently been raised. IV.— Mohammerah. Sheikh Khazal is the acknowledged Head of the Muhaisen tribe of the Chaab Arabs, living on both sides of the Karun, from near Shuster to its junction with the Shat-ei-Arab near Mohammerah, and on the left bank of the Shat-el-Arab from Mohammerah to its mouth, and between the Tigris and the Shat-el-Arab to the west, and to the Jerrish River on the east. As regards the Persian Government, the position of the Sheikh, who murdered his brother, Sheikh Mizal, in 1897, has always been that of a great feudal Prince, who in smaller matters has thought it well to humour the Central Government while remaining at the same time extremely jealous in matters touching his quasi-indepen dence. His attitude to British interests has been friendly, and in striking contrast to that of the Persian officials in South-west Persia. Ever since 1898 the Sheikh has shown himself nervous about his position in the event of the break-up of the Persian Empire, and anxious to obtain guarantees regarding the independence of his territories in certain eventualities. In November 1899, when Sir M. Durand visited the Karun, the Sheikh made a request for assurances. While declining to afford guarantees of the nature desired, Sir M. Durand intimated to him that “he might rely upon our help whenever we could give it without ill-faith to the Persian Government.” The intention formed by the Central Government in 1900 to include Moham merah in the newly organized Customs system increased the anxiety of the Sheikh to obtain some kind of guarantee, the more so since rumours were prevalent that the * * It was again repeated to Major Cox in July 1904, the merchants offering to pay a fee equivalent to 2,000 rupees per annum towards the cost of the appointment.15 contemplated changes would he used as a pretext for putting an end to his power as that of the last of the great feudal Chiefs of Persia. Pears were also entertained that if the Sheikh were forcibly to resist any such attempts the Persian Government would retaliate by their favourite method of intrigue, and endeavour to create dissension in the Chaab tribe by setting up the nephew of Sheikh Khazal, Sheikh Aboud, who resided at Ahwaz, and was not on the most cordial terms with his uncle. In March 1900 a Memorandum was communicated to the Persian Government by Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires. In this paper it was stated that the British Consul-General at Bushire had recently called Lord Salisbury’s attention to the state of affairs at Mohammerah. In order to avoid difficulties in the future his Lordship thought it best that there should be a clear understanding of his views as to the ports of Mohammerah, Bushire, and Bunder Abbas, and other ports of the Gulf. The control of these ports by a foreign Power might lead to a state of things which Her Majesty’s Government, in the interests of the Indian Empire, would he hound to resist. This had been recognized by the Persian Government, who, on the 23rd October, 1897, gave a written promise that the customs of Southern Persia should never he placed under foreign control and supervision. Her Majesty’s Government must hold the Persian Government to the strict observance of this engagement. As the Persian Government were aware, far the larger part of the trade of the above-mentioned ports was British. This trade imposed certain duties upon Her Majesty’s Government, and they could not pass without notice any measure likely to effect its position and prospects. It was from this point of view that the Marquess of Salisbury desired to inform the Persian Government that, in view of British interests in the trade of Mohammerah and in the navigation of the Karun, Her Majesty’s Government must insist upon their right to be consulted before any change were made in the administration of the customs or in the position of the Sheikh. In claiming such a right of consultation, the Persian Government could have no doubt as to the anxiety of the British Government for the preservation of order, the maintenance of the Persian sovereignty, and the improvement of Persian resources. In all these the interests of Her Majesty’s Government were second only to those of Persia herself. The reply of the Persian Government was verbal:— ‘‘Not only in Mohammerah, but in every part of Persia where British interests were concerned, the Persian Government, before taking any steps of importance, would consult the British Government, but Persia could not give a definite Agreement with regard to a special point of her territory, as such an Agreement might appear to others like a consent to partition.” Mr. Spring- Kiee, No. 17, March 27, 1900. Mr. Spriug- Rice, No. 27, April 5, 1900. On the 10th May, 1900, Lord Salisbury addressed a despatch to Her Majesty’s 'Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, in which he wrote as follows :— “ You should take any opportunity that may offer itself to explain that Her Majesty’s Government have no desire to diminish, but rather seek to uphold and confirm, the authority of the Persian Government in the southern provinces, and that it is in the interest of Persia, as well as of Great Britain, that they endeavour to prevent the intrusion of other Powers.” The annexed extracts from a despatch, dated July 1901, from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, show in some detail how the question of giving a British assurance to the Sheikh arose :— “ The Sheikh is evidently nervous about the designs of the Persian Government, and looks Sir A. to us for assistance and protection. Hardiuge, “ If a Russian Consul-General should come to Bushire the Sheikh may, should such support No- 118, be withheld by us, be tempted to coquet with him, or at any rate to modify to some extent the 'Mr friendly relations which he has hitherto cultivated with the British Resident at Bushire. 1JUI * “ It is undoubtedly important that he should continue to be our friend and to be guided by our advice, and I am therefore anxious to be able to give him such assurances of support as will prevent his looking for help elsewhere. “I shall visit him in the course of the tour to the Persian Gulf ports which I hope to undertake next October, and I should be grateful if your Lordship would instruct me as to the language which I should hold to him in reply to the questions which he will almost certainly put to me in regard to possible difficulties between himself and the Persian Government. “ My idea is that we should endeavour to persuade him to come to a fair arrangement with [2878 s—1] F i lunik’t to your Lxcei 1Sir A. Hardinge, No. 167 , December 5 , 1902 . Sir A. Hardinge, No. 65, April 7, 1904. Consul McDouall, No. 1, August 25, 1904. 16 the Persian Customs, as it is impossible that M. Nans, in reorganizing that service, can allow so important a port as Mohammerah to remain beyond his control, but that we should, in view ol possible Russian activity in Southern Persia, attach him to ourselves by a promise that we will not let his political authority over his tribesmen be destroyed or undermined by the Persian Government. _ “ I am fully aware of the difficulty of supporting local quasi-hereditary Chiefs who are subjects of the Shah against endeavours by the Persian Government to weaken then positions and extend the power of the Central Government at their expense. Seistan is a case in point. “ At the same time our neglect or reluctance to do this may be taken advantage of to the detriment of our interests by our rivals, and it is clear that Colonel Kemball thinks that some definite assurance of assistance in certain contingencies should be given to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. “I would propose to urge him to be loyal to the Persian Government, to come, with the help and, if necessary, mediation of His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, to an arrangement with the Customs which would. 1 indemnify him for the loss of their administration by himself, and to trust to us to protect him against any attempt from Tehran—in my opinion, a very improbable one—to diminish or encroach upon his authority as Chief over his people. If we give him an assurance that we shall so protect him, we ought to be prepared, in the unlikely contingency of such an attempt as I have suggested, to send a gun-boat to Mohammerah and to let the Persians know that we shall not acquiesce without good reason to the deposition of the Sheikh, or in interference by the Governor-General of Arabistan in the internal affairs of his tribe. “Your Lordship can, of course, judge better than I to what extent the grant of such an assurance is in accordance with the general policy of His Majesty s Government in Southern Persia, and how far it would be wise and safe to give it. It is clear that the Sheikh is, perhaps, unnecessarily anxious about his future, though no doubt he is more or less trying to bluff us into giving him pledges of support; but I would venture to submit that the time has come for us to decide how far we are prepared to back him up, should the Persian Government, perhaps at Russian instigation, determine to destroy his, so to speak, autonomous position, and what counsel Colonel Kemball and I should give him should he appeal to us, as he seems disposed to do, for our advice.” The upshot of this correspondence was that Sir A. Hardinge informed the Sheikh on the 7th December, 1902, under instructions from Lord Lansdowne, that “ we shall protect Mohammerah against naval attack by a foreign Power, whatever pretext for such action may he alleged, and also, so long as you remain faithful to the Shall and act in accordance with our advice, shall continue to give you our good offices and support.” This assurance was really necessitated by the urgency of arriving at a solution of the question, as Sir A. Hardinge reported in March 1902 that the Russians had been making offers for over a year to reduce the Sheikh of Mohammerah to subjection by force, and that they had been pressing the Persian Government to adopt towards him an uncompromising attitude. The assurance was actually given after an Arrange ment about the Customs had been concluded, largely owing to the friendly intervention of His Majesty’s Government; but it was probably only in consequence of this assurance that the Sheikh consented to avoid friction and to make the new Arrangement work smoothly. On the 24th December, 1903, Sir A. Hardinge addressed a note to the Sheikh confirming the assurance of 1902, and adding that he might rest assured of the support of the British Government so long as he on his side observed the conditions of the Arrangement made with the Persian Government. In 1.904 a Russian decoration was conferred on the Sheikh and a Commercial Mission was sent to Mohammerah. One of the principal reasons for avoiding a conflict between the Persian Govern ment and the Sheikh of Mohammerah has been the fear that such an event would raise the much larger question of the Turco-Persian frontier dispute. Mohammerah and the surrounding district have always been a bone of contention between the Turks and the Persians, and only recently the Sheikh expressed his apprehensions to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire in regard to recent developments at more northerly points of the frontier. The views of his Majesty’s Government are explained in the subjoined despatches. “ Sir Edward Grey to Mr. Marling. “ (No. 21.) “ gi r? “ Foreign Office, February 25, 1908. “ 1 have received your despatch No. 17 of the 28th ultimo, in which you forward telegraphic correspondence with His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire relative to the apprehensions of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in regard to recent developments on the Turco-Persian frontier. “I concur in your opinion that a gun-boat need not be sent to the Shatt-el-Arab under existing conditions, and I consider that when an attack appears more imminent the precise action to be taken by His Majesty’s Government can be determined.“ It would, however, be advisable, in order to allay the Sheikh’s apprehensions, to inform him that His Majesty’s Government are fully alive to the situation, but that they do not anticipate Turkish aggression in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah, and you should instruct Major Cox accordingly.” “ Sir Edivard Grey to Sir N. O'Conor. “ (No. 75.) “ Sir, “ Foreign Office, February 25, 1908. “I transmit to your Excellency herewith a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, relative to the apprehensions of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in regard to recent developments on the Turco-Persian frontier. “As you are aware, His Majesty’s Government have been content to allow the Russian Government, as being more closely concerned, to take the lead in regard to making any proposals for arresting the Turkish encroachments so long as they are confined to the northern portion of the frontier ; but it is desirable that your Excellency should clearly understand that the position would be materially altered if there were to be an advance of Ottoman troops to the south, more especially in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. In this district His Majesty’s Government are not prepared to recognize any other frontier than that laid down by the mediating Commissioners in 1850, as indicated in red on the accompanying sketch map ; and in this connection I may recall the admission made by the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs to Her Majesty’s Ambassador on the 18th November, 1893, to the effect that ‘the Turkish Government laid no claim whatever to Mohammerah.’ “ Any disturbance of the status quo at Mohammerah would affect British interests, and might not improbably lead to the active intervention of His Majesty’s Government, who have given the Sheikh certain assurances in regard to his territory. “Your Excellency should accordingly instruct His Majesty’s Consuls at Bagdad and Hussorah to furnish by telegraph early information of any aggressive designs in the district in question.” In January 1908 the British Consul-General at Bushire reported that the Sheikh India Office, was anxious that His Majesty’s Government should guarantee himself and his own family as heirs in the enjoyment of their present position. Sir E. Grey considered that it would be advisable to maintain an attitude of reserve on this subject.

Sir:- •r b I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith ^ copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d*Affaires at Tehran respecting the wish of the Sheikh of Mohammera and of the Bakhtiari Khans for closer relations with Great Britain. I am to suggest, for the consideration of Secretary Viscount Morley that, in view of the fact that the Sheikh of Mohammera, by reason of the geographical situation of his possessions and his considerable lo cal influence, is in a position to hinder and even to prevent the prosecution of any foreign enterprise in the country watered by the Karun, it is very desir able to secure his absolute adherence to British in terests in order to ensure tnat his power may always be exercised in their favour by opposing any schemes which may be distasteful to His Majesty’s Government.

External aggres sion would constitute an infringement of Persian in tegrity which is recognized hy the Anglo-Russian Con vention. The Bakhtiari Khans, on the other hand, occupy a different position and their aims appear to he in the direction of independence. His Majesty's Government are not hound hy any assurances with regard to them. They have not shown themselves to he trustworthy in the past and their recent behaviour towards British enterprises in their country, such as those of the 4 ' It might further be pointed out to Oil\£&gt;1 Oil Concessions Syndicate and of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation and Persian Transport Com panies Limited, has not been satisfactory. Sir E.Grey therefore considers that any engage ment given to the Khans, beyond an assurance of friend ly sympathy, would be likely to be utilised by them to create difficulties between His Majesty’s and the Persian Governments. I am to state that Sir E.Grey would be glad to receive in due course an expression of Lord Morley's views and of those of the Government of India on this question in its general aspect and also with regard to the suggestions set forth above.

It would se n fron, tlese nap ere that both Sariar Arfa and the IZkexis have been led to nek.® advances to us frora eiui- lar motives, vis. ao^rohenEion that their present position of semi-independence may be tlir'?atened ; eitl er fro^ within by the change dm the form of Government in Persia ; or from without' by direct aggression on the nart of the Turks. As regards the former cause it seems to me orohable that these • Ohiefs have been unduly impressed with tht blatant tal... of the TeJ ran Press, which, is given to discussing,in what, oon- Kidering the hopelesr: Central Goviin ent, are ludicrously confident terras, wha,t the sovereign Assembly of Persia will do. Ifliat seems to excite most aprrehe ns ion is the prospect that the struggle between the Shah and the reform party will end in the triumph of tie lat ©r. That l STcA-e. such t-riix he the i$ggpro is, I think, the opinion of most com petent observers, but considering the ineptitude which the Assembly has hitherto shewn for representative Govern...ent there seems to be lit le prospect that any aihulniltration is likely to be found in Feta fa, for many years to come, strong enough to attempt to attack the present position of the eemvi- indepenient tributary tribes. On the contrary, it appears ■i-he Rigj -1 honourable, Sir Sd??or 1 Grey, 3 aro.net, ;.r. Stc., etc., etc •, mmt,o me more than probable that the task of governing thoce rsrtr, of Per si a, nominal ly directly e/ininirtered fro.ji Tehren, will ro tax bn© energies of the Mlnirtorr that they will be h-cu.-a to onxy toe glad not toterfere whsr^jv^r tlier? it: a local aucdiority capable of ia 0 .intaliiing a reasonable decree or order. In these circumstances I am inclined to think tl.at the Sbeikl of Moham-ierah may consider hie position as fairly roll assured for a good many years to come without ony special guarantees from us, and it is for the 3akfctlari® to secure thesis-elver in like lornuer ly out ing their house in order and giving no pretext for attempted interference in their affairs from Tehran. In ©njr case I presume that we can scarcely make any reply sued: as would encourage the lakrtiari Ilians and Sheiltb khazzal to Relieve that we favour any agreement between them aimed at their eventual indcrendcnce. Such a step would scarcely be in ac or dance with the ^ nirit of cur recent underteking to respect the integrity of Persia. As regards the second point, i.e. the apprehension of attack from the Turks, I understand from your Per patch ko. 21 (6428) ox February 36th last, that His Majesty’s tove n ent consider our interests in South WC’dtern Persia ere of suffi- ciont importance to worranb us in toking steps- to prs-vent any serious disturbance of ttw status quo, end I venture to uLixitk. that some general asrurences of this nature would suf fice to alley local an rcbenrion.

In connection with the abovementioned naoore I bog to refer to, and to quote for facility of reference, a memorandum recorded by Sir Louis . ane at the time of the tour made by Hie Excellency Lord CAarson and sir Arthur ; ardinge to th© Persian Gulf in tiie winter of lift?,* The passage i refer to runs ao follower (vide enclosureenclosure to Foreign Department Mo. 694-E.A*, dated 1st March 1904):- *The question of increasing our influence In the Lur and •.jalrhtyari country ^ an d of strengthening tlie tribes in 'South-western Persia, so as to enable them to hold their own in the event of a collapse of the central power or trouble in 'South-western Persia was discussed on several occasions by ills 'Excellency with Sir Arthur Harding#. * * * * It wae ' recognised that our future action in South-western Persia must Blargely depend on the extent to which we could strengthen and utilise both tribes and the tribes of Arabistan, who under the ' Sheikh of Mohamserah are in much the same position'. 3* It will be seen froffiffray present enclosures that practically simultaneously, though independently, the Chiefs of the D&amp;khty- aris and of the Arab tribes of Arabistan respectively have be come apprehensive as to their future and convinced that their interests lie in union among themselves, if possible under our aegis. 'Hie Sheikh of i oheiamerah, encouraged no doubt by the understand ing at which his fidus Achates Sheikh Mubarek h&amp;e arrived at with us, presses for an assurance that his lineal heirs will be maintained in the enjoyment of their oroaent patrimony, and will &gt; —— - — —- - - be reasonably safeguarded against curtailment of their present semi-independent position and powers by the central Government. As arguments in support of #iis rights or strong claims to such treatment Shaikh Khas&amp;l adduces the fact that ever since his accession the Central Government have obliged him to meet from private funds very heavy expenditure which should pronerjy have fallen on the Government Exchequer, and that now during the current iirco- eraian crisis the Central Government have left him absolutely to take care of himself in the best way he can, in fact, have neither the means nor the power to do anything to help him in the event of his territory being invaded by Turkish troops. In this respect he is in a measure comforted by his con fidence in Great Britain to prevent any attack upon him by sea but in the event of an invasion from the landside he feels that heIt he would be placed in a very serious position, seeing that he possesses no artillery or large supply of ammunition. In return for such assurances from us as his heart desires he expresses his readiness to bind himself to us in any way which may seem to ua feasible. The Bakhtiarls intimate that, prompted by the common sentiments of self-preservation,they contemplate allying themselves with the of Shaikh ^Mohammerah, and in the hope of thus maintaining a position of semi or practical independence they are anxious to enter into a secret understanding with the British Government. I do not feel that I can safely or usefully offer much comment upon their respective representations, as in such a question my field of vision is too confined to allow me to see the matter in the right perspective. I can only say as a local officer that it seoms toime that having by the terms of our convention with Russia l left the region affected in the neutral zone and exposed to German enterprise, it is of the utmost importance to our interests to CovuiCttrroLAjb the disadvantages of that cas far as pos sible and without delay by strengthening our hold as much as we can upon the Chiefs of South Western Persia before the opportunity +f _ to do so passes out our control. ^ As far as the Shaikh of Mohamraerah is concerned I believe him to be primarily quite sincere in his protestations that his inter- w ests and hopes aro centred in us* Nevertheless he is mainly promp- ted by the dictates of self-preservation and should^failure on our partdispel his apprehensions, it is as well to remember that he is likely to be greatly influenced by his astute henchman and relative Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar, who la possessed by no feelings of tradition or sentiment or by any considerations other than those of personal agrandisement and present profit, and would I doubt not, as lief pursue his schemes through German auspices as ours if the former were made sufficiently attractive to him and ours were too luke warm.

On this occasion they made the startling announcement that, after due consideration, they found themselves so dissatisfied with the present state of the Persian Government that they were v contemplating throwing off allegiance to it. They had entered into negociations with Sheikh Khasal on the subject and would have me understand that they had made some progress in them, and that the Sheikh had indicated that he shared their feelings and aspirations. It was proposed to have a personal meeting with him in order to bring matters to a practical issue in the form of a treaty or convention, and for this purpose they intended to shortly pay a visit to Nasiri. There they would exchange written undertakings with the Sheikh, which they would ask me to guarantee Their ambition was to attain the position of quasi independent protectorates, of which they cited us cat and b.oweit as examples, and with this end in view they were nrepared to accept our sover eignty, paying their revenues to us and putting their population at our disposal for military training. They recognised that their agreements among themselves lacked stability, and they would loose to us to enforce on both sides the observance of their treaty with the Sheikh. 3. Previously, and in my absence, the Shahab had begged my Pirza to gain my adherens© to their project, and professed the uhans willingnessvjillingness to rurnish us with all necessary signed agreements. My mirza expressed himself doubtful of my attaching much weight to their signed undertakings, gently reminding the Shahab that the seal on the document which he had handed me at Kima last March was yet scarcely dry. This silenced the Shahab, who did not want the Salar T s curiosity aroused regarding that episode in his past career. r. . - ■ - 1 - ■ . •- * • &gt;r. . . . t, 4. In the course of the conversation the Salar remarked that they had some 40,000 subjects capable of bearing arms, but og these only some 10000 were provided with fire-arms. This estimate nfxtfeK I may observe is the most sane statement of the fighting strength of the Bakhtyari tribes which I have yet had made to me. The Salar also said that some British representative (Coloh&amp;l Douglas in 1904?) had approached them on the subject of raising and training forces in their country. At that time they were not prepared to favour such a step, but that their feelings had under gone a change, and that now they were anxious for it. Let us knsw i now play up to our own proposals. 5. I answered very briefly that I was unable personally to make *■ them any reply, but that I would lay their proposals before my Coverhment. I also stated that their proposals appeared to me to involve issues of great magnitude, and of such a nature that our ♦: i C engagements with Persia and other Pov/ers would make it very difficult for us to accept any part in them. 6 . The short time at my command and my unwillingness to display too great interest in the subversive projects of the ‘Chans, pre vented me from attempting to draw from them a more detailed statement of the precise course of action they have in view, and of the means and met||ods which they propose to employ. I can therefore only communicate the above precis of what passed between us. This I do merely for the information of Government. I do not propose to offer any comments on a subject which stands to be judged on general and not local grounds, but I may remark that I question the probability of Sheikh Khazal’s committing himself in the way desired by the Khans, though he may, to gain fugitiveMinute Paper Register No. SECRET DEPARTMENT Letter from 7*.

As you are aware, His Majesty’s Government have been content to allow the Russian Government, as being more closely concerned, to take the lead in regard to making any proposals for arresting the Turkish encroachments so long as they are confined to the northern portion of the frontier ; but it is desirable that your Excellency should clearly understand that the position would be materially altered if there were to be an advance of Ottoman troops to the south, more especially in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. In this district His Majesty’s Government are not prepared to recognize any other frontier than that laid down by the mediating Commissioners in 1850, as indicated in red on the accompanying sketch map ; and in this connection I may recall the admission made by the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs to Her Majesty’s Ambassador on the 18th November, 1893, to the effect that “the Turkish Government laid no claim whatever to Mohammerah.” Anv disturbance of the status quo at Mohammerah would affect British interests, and might not improbably lead to the active intervention of His Majesty’s Government, who have given the Sheikh certain assurances in regard to his territory. Your Excellency should accordingly instruct His Majesty’s Consuls at Bagdad and Bussorah to furnish by telegraph early information of any aggressive designs in the district in question. , / jjapc • A copy of a despatch which I have addressed to His Majesty s Charge d Affaires at Tehran is inclosed for your information.! 1 am, Ac.

It would, however, be advisable, in order to allay the Sheikh’s apprehensions, to inform him that His Majesty’s Government are fully alive to the situation, but that they do not anticipate Turkish aggression in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah, and you should instruct Major Cox accordingly.

SHEIKH of Mohammerah, in a recent interview, complained strongly of the unsatisfactory situation in which he finds himself in connection with the Turco-Persian frontier question. He has no instructions as to the course he should pursue if hostilities break out from the Persian Government, who leave him entirely in the dark as to what is going- on. Although he has under his jurisdiction an extensive frontier, starting a short distance above Mohammerah from the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, he has been provided neither with guns nor munitions of war. A useful argument in future in support of the Sheikh’s tribal status and semi independence would seem to be furnished to us by the fact that he is being left to take care of himself on this occasion. The protection of Mohammerah from naval attack has already been undertaken by us. Would it not now be possible to inform the Porte that we could not permit hostilities, either by river or land, between Bussorah and Mohammerah, our commercial interests in those two places and the Shatt-el-Arab being too great to admit of such an eventuality ? The only recent information I have is from Reuter’s telegrams. The situation, however, seems to be acute, and it would be prudent to retain a British gun-boat in the Shatt-el-Arab so long as it remains so. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Mr. Marling to Consul-General Cox. (No. 13.) ITelecrra-nhio ) P Tehran, January 18, 1908. TURCO-PERSIAN frontier question. Please refer to your telegram No. 16 of to-day. Present position is as follows :— The Turks, seizing opportunity offered by weak condition of Persia and present disinclination of the two mediating Powers to exert forcible pressure, have occupied certain districts to the west of Lake Urumia, and are endeavouring to create disorder by stirring up the frontier tribes of Azerbaijan and Kurdistan. Firman Firma is now in difficulties, having proceeded to Soujboulak, which was threatened by the latter tribes, to restore order. At Urnmia a joint Turco-Persian Commission is about to sit. It seems improbable that the Turks will extend their activities as far as the [2836 r—14] ■ i—Sheikh’s territory, though vague indications are to hand of a Turkish movement in the neighbourhood of Khanikin, but not farther south. A warning in the general sense of your suggestion was conveyed to the Porte long ago by Sir N. O’Conor, and I do not think it is at present necessary to have a gun-boat on the Shatt-el-Arab. If the Urumia Commission can effect nothing, it is possible that we may eventually have to force the Turks to accept our arbitration, and in the meanwhile British and Russian Embassies are working actively at Constantinople, though without much practical effect as yet.Minute Paper.

Sir I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending gar ding the possibility of Clause 9 of the Bunder Shv/aikh lease being construed into the grant to Sheikh Mubarek bin Subah, of a dynastic guarantee. 2. On 7th instant, accompanied by Ur. McDouall, I had a long interview with the Sheikh of Uohamnerah, at the latter's urgent request, on trie subject of his affairs and future. A separate report will be submitted in regard to what passed generally; meanwhile it seems advisable to communicate the following to Government without delay. While explaining his ever present apprehensions as to trie fate that may be in store for him at the hands of a strongly established ’’Majlis' or, alternatively, in event of the collapse of the Majlis and an upheaval in Persia, the Sheikh expressed his anxious hope that the British Government would feel able to give him, in return for some suitable agreement from himself, an undertaking to maintain him and Ills children in the enjoyment of the rights and status at present possessed by him as Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Arab tribes pertaining thereto. with my telegram No. 785, dated the 23rd December 1907, re- As it appeared pjrina facie to Ur. McDouall and myself that the terminology employed by the speaker could only beo interpreted ae a request for &amp; dynastic guarantee we were at pains to probe his meaning. ', r e asked him did he suggest that the Britiso. Government should guarantee the continued existence o.l an Arab Sheikh of Mohammerah on the present lines; or, that they should guarantee the maintenance of him personally and his own family heirs in the enjoyment of their present position. He answered without hesitation that the latter was his intended meaning, adding in explanation that his own para- raountcy was unquestioned; that his son Sheikh Chasib was universally regarded by his dependents as his natural suc cessor and that in case of Sheikh Chasib’s demise he had other sons and blood relations who could succeed. Ho reference was of course made by him or me to our recent agreement with Sheikh Uubarek, but, as the Government of India are aware, the two Sheikhs are fast friends and it may be taken for granted that Sheikh Ifubarek had informed his comrade of his own agreement with us, and that the latter had it in mind when he expressed himself as above, For this reason I report the incident as indirectly hearing upon the issue raised in the correspondence alluded to in the first paragraph of this communication.

UNDER this office No. 94, dated the 2nd instant, I had the honour to forward, for your Excellency’s information. Lieutenant Lorimer’s Report No. 17, dated the 21 st June, in paragraph 9, of which His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Ahwaz dealt with the local aspect of the support which His Majesty’s Government had expressed their readiness to afford to the principality^ of Mohammerah. 2. I now submit copies of two further letters since received from Vice - Consul Lo rimer. The earliest of these two communications deals with two irrigation schemes, and one proposal for the purchase of certain riparian property. The second letter is connected with a supposed endeavour on the part of the Sheikh of Mohammerah to get Messrs. Lynch to move your Excellency to advise the Central Government to reimburse for expenses incurred retrospectively and prospectively, in policing highways of trade in Arabistan. Each of these subjects I commend to your Excellency for such consideration as you may feel able to give it on its merits. The irrigation projects mentioned in letter No. 25, would no doubt require to be subjected to expert examination before any measure of participation in them, direct or indirect, could be seriously considered by Government, and with the information at present available to me it is difficult to venture any opinion as to their soundness. What irrigation is doing for Egypt, and might do for the region with which we are now concerned is a matter of common knowledge. 3. The course suggested in the second of the inclosures seems primd facie to be worthy of your Excellency’s good offices, but, in forwarding these papers what I would ask you especially to notice is the general trend of these and previous reports received from His Majesty’s newly-appointed Vice-Consul at Ahwaz. They seem to make it clear that the Sheikh of Mohammerah, in spite of authoritative pronouncements and advice communicated to bun by your Excellency, and notwithstanding his own repeated assurances to the contrary, is chating at the difficulties and uncertainty of his relations and position in regard to the Shah’s Government, and is at heart dis satisfied by the need of prospective support of which His Majesty’s Government has hitherto felt in a position to assure him. 4 . From the records on the subject available to me it appears exceedingly improbable that in the absence of any provocative cause, His Majesty’s Government would see its wav to amplify its promises in the direction of active support. On the other hand, it is not inconceivable that the Government might come to the conclusion that our position and influence in Arabistan, and our hold over tne present Eulci of Mohammeiuh might be strengthened without dereliction of our obligations to a Iriendly lower, and witnout laying [2182 c —2] B2 ourselves open to the suspicion that we were encouraging the Sheikh to free himself from allegiance to the Persian Government, by our acquiring concrete vested interests in the prosperity and development of Arabistan, supposing always that the soundness of anv agricultural scheme were adequately demonstrated. It is this general aspect of the possibilities indicated by Lieutenant Lorimer’s reports that I would respectively invite your Excellency’s attention, apart from the consideration r on their merits of the several projects now ventilated, and which it would be undesirable to see handled by non-British agencies. 1 , 5. A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to the Foreign Department of the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) P. Z. COX. In closure 2 in Xo. 1. Vice-Consul Larimer to Major Cox. (No. 25.) (Confidential.) July 2, 1904. I HAVE the honour to recur to a question raised in my despatch, dated the 21st June, 1904, namely, the relations of the British Government and the Sheikh of Mohammerah. The present form in which the subject invites attention is that of financial assistance. I learned first that the Sheikh had been making obscure references through confidential employes of Messrs. Lynch to two or three schemes, for the furtherance of which he would be glad to receive aid from our Government. These schemes are :— 1 . 1 he irrigation of part of Arabistan by five or six steam-pump barges placed on the Karun below Ahwaz. 2 . The construction of irrigation works on the rapids at Ahwaz on the site of the old “ Band.” 3. The purchase of certain land from the Nizam-us-Sultaneh. Shortly afterwards he called on me, and I was able to talk of the first scheme, which is public knowledge, and to approach the subject of the second. I he third I did not care to introduce. The Sheikh is an impossible man to get any expression of opinion from when Haji Pais, his counsellor, is not present. He ventured, however, to commit himself so far as to give me to understand that under certain circumstances he would not be averse to receiving financial help from the British Government in connection with the first and second schemes. Later I had a private interview with Haji Rais-ut-Tujar on the same subject. He put the matter in this form that I should on my own account invite the opinion of Government on the matter as though the conception were entirely my own, and had not emanated from or been discussed with the Sheikh. If the answer were favourable, he (Haji Rais) would undertake to work the Sheikh into a favourable frame of mind. I shall proceed to give some explanation of the schemes. No. 1 . The Sheikh has for some time, it appears, entertained this notion. How it was suggested to his mind I do not know. A certain Mr. Blunsum, of the Bussorah Iradmg Company, has been here prospecting for the last six weeks. On his first arrival at Mohammerah he conceived the same idea, and was very surprised to learn that he had been forestalled in it by the Sheikh. He came up across country and examined the land and nvei ban.v.^ He then interviewed the Sheikh, and has been authorized (I have it only from himself in confidence) to make inquiries in England and furnish estimates. Hr. Blunsum would, of course, like to secure the working of the scheme if feasible for us own Company, but I am sure the Sheikh would not part with its control. In this case Mr. Blunsum says that his firm would be prepared to give all necessary assistance, asking, in return, a preference in the purchase of the produce^of the land irrigated. 1 he Sheikh is, I believe, prepared to spend 15,000/. or 20,0001. on this scheme. If the expense proved greater, I understand him to imply that he would accept our help, eisonalh, 1 believe that he would do so, if it were proposed, in any case.f V 1 he practicability of the scheme remains to be proved. The working expenses, more particularly the supply ot coal, will run into large figures, and the pumps, &amp;c., will require renewal from time to time. No. 2 . For the second conception the Sheikh would hardly admit his responsibility. Fie treated it as a castle in the air. He said that he believed it would cost 500,000/., and that he would only undertake it on two conditions:— ( 1 .) Financial assistance. ( 2 .) Another.” By the latter he meant a guarantee of support from the British Government. The scheme is a very big and difficult one, but it would turn a large part of Arabistan into a permanent garden, and, granted security, there is scarcely room tor doubt that it would prove an excellent investment. It would, of course, be necessary to devise some means of securing its advantages to our own traders. _ 3. The third scheme refers to a large tract of land on the west bank of the Karun. I am indebted to Haji Rais for the following particulars :— The land is the property of the Nizam-us-Sultaneh, and is leased from him by the Sheikh for 1,500/. per annum. In Sheikh Mizal’s time, owing to the unruly state of the Arab inhabitants, the Nizam-us-Sultaneh was very anxious to sell it. Sheikh Mizal, however, did not then want to purchase, and instead reduced the Arabs to order; and the present arrangement was come to. Under the present improved circumstances, the Nizam would ask an impossible or exorbitant price for it. Haji Rais hinted, however, that a time might come when the Nizam-us-Sultaneh would be willing to sell. The price might then be brought down to, perhaps, 30,000/. Beyond the advantage of increased hold on the Sheikh’s “affections,” 1 do not see clearly that we would stand to gain anything in helping him in this project. It would, of course, help towards the consolidation of his power in Arabistan. In seeking financial aid, 1 do not think that the Sheikh’s ultimate object would be merely money, but rather an actual or practical guarantee by the British Government. Inclosure 3 in No. 1 .

I HAVE the honour to recall attention to a remark in paragraph 9 of my No. 17, dated the 21st June, in which I stated that I thought the Sheikh of Mohammerah was inclined to hint that we should try and take steps to press the Persian Government to refund him the expenses he has lately incurred in protecting the “ Shushan ” and the route of Arabistan. I now forw'ard inclosed two papers, wffiich were recently handed me by Mr. Wilson, of Messrs. Lynch Brothers. The Arabic note was dictated by Haji Rais-ut-Tujar to a confidential Arab clerk in Messrs. Lynch’s employ. Whether the paper was intended to come to me I do not know 7 . At any rate, it must be treated as highly confidential. For this reason I have not attempted to have the original translation made for Mr. Wilson revised. Ttie note was supposed to indicate the form of a letter which Mr. Wilson was to write to the British Minister. B 2 [2182 c— 2 ]4- Inclosure 4 in No. 1 . Note dictated by Haji Rais-ut-Tujar to an Arab Clerk of Messrs. Lynch. (Translation.) Proposed. Draft from Messrs. Lynch to Minister, Tehran. r ABOUT a month ago his Excellency Sheikh Khazal, Sardar Arfa,came to Nasiri and the Karun, and sent his nephew with many sowars to Shuster and Dizful, and fully arranged matters in Arabistan. At the same time, all the Khasray and Abdul Khan from fear of the Sheikh, fled and absented themselves from these tow districts, and went to the Beni-Taroff, and we sent the steam-ship “Shushan ” in safety until the arrival of the Azam-us-Sultaneh, Governor of Arabistan. We see that the Sheikh is incurring all the expenses on this account—the main tenance of order and the service of the Government—and, according to what we hear, this expenditure will come from his own pocket, and the Government will not help him over this expenditure. ^ As long as the Sheikh is put to the entire expense of keeping order in the Shat-el- Arab for the protection of the country, and in the Karun as far as Dizful, and his Government will give him nothing to compensate him for all these expenses, let it be known to you that he cannot bear these expenses for more than two months at the outside. When the Governor comes, he (the Sheikh) will withdraw himself from the maintenance of order in Shuster and Dizful, and when he withdraws we inform you that peace will become confusion, as heretofore. If you will relate this to the Persian Government, an arrangement will be come to with the Sheikh, and he will be given assistance in the matter of expenditure, so that he may always strive to do his utmost and keep sowars for the purpose of keeping Dizful and Shuster in order, and there will be peace and rest for all, especially for our trade. And since we know that the Persian authorities are not supported nor fitted out by the Government with strength sufficient to enable them to make satisfactory arrangement even if they were willing to send many soldiers they would not be able to cope with the’ situation successfully, and it is easier for them to come to some arrangement with the Sheikh, in which there will be ease for the Government of Iran and for the people of Arabistan and for all. 1 * Inclosure 5 in No. 1 .

The Reis-et-Tujjar then said that the Sheikh of Mohammerah was communicating* his reply to His Majesty’s Minister’s letter verbally, through the British Consul, as he was unwilling to trust the post or write in Persian, as his letter might be read by other than the English Staff of His Majesty’s Legation. In the same way, and for the same reasons, he preferred that communications of importance should be sent him in English, and translated to him by the British Consul. The Reis-et-Tujjar then proceeded to say on behalf of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, in reply to the letter from His Majesty’s Minister dated Bagdad the 24th December, 1903:—■ That with regard to the assistance promised him in resisting any attempt of the Persian Government to repudiate the arrangement made with him regarding the Mohammerah Customs, the Sheikh is greatly obliged. As yet the Persian Government has not taken sufficiently decided action in that direction to render the intervention of His Majesty’s Minister necessary. But the Sheikh will inform His Majesty’s Minister in the event of his being so circumstanced as to require such assistance. As regards the action of the Belgian Customs authorities in repudiating the promise of M. Naus, that articles imported for the Sheikh’s private use should be exempt from Customs dues, the Sheikh is now in correspondence with M. Naus on this point. If a satisfactory result is not arrived at he will inform His Majesty’s Minister. The Sheikh of Mohammerah is now in camp at Muzafferia, and the letter of M. Naus exempting the Sheikh from customs dues is at Eeilieh; when he returns to Mohammerah, the Sheikh will submit, as requested, a copy of this letter to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. (Signed) E.

I HAVE received a telegram in reply to the one to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from Mohammerah, after my first interview with your Excellency. Lord Lansdowne says that if, as he presumes is the case from my account of your Excellency’s statement to me, the Persian Government is really attempting to repudiate the arrangement made with you last year, I am authorized to say that you are in his opinion justified in oppo sing such attempt. He instructs me to remind you of the message which he sent you lasryear, and to add that you may rest assured of the support of the British Government so long as you on your side observe the conditions of the arrangement made between the Persian Government and yourself. He has authorized me to point out to that Government the necessity for respecting the conditions of the arrangement on their side. 1 do not propose to do so until 1 hear further from you, as 1 think it will be better in the interests of good relations between the Persian authorities and yourself that our intervention should not be invoked until all other means of adjusting matters directly between them and you have been exhausted. Meanwhile I should be obliged if you would send me to Tehran, through His Majesty’s Resident at Bushire, a copy of the note from M. Naus, promising not to take duty on your personal imports, and any further information on the subject. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUR H. HARDINGE. No. 2.

Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—{Received January 19, 1904.) (No. 8 . Confidential.) My Lord, ^ Ahwaz, December 11 , 1903. I HAVE the honour to report that I left Bushire on the evening of the 7th instant and reached Mohammerah the following afternoon, where I received on landing the official visit of Sheikh Khazal. In the course of the return visit which I paid him next day, he spoke at great length on the subject of his political position, and complained that the Persian Government were systematically endeavouring to undermine it, and that, notwithstanding all the services he had rendered, and was still prepared to render to us, His Majesty’s Govern ment did not support him as it did other Arab Sheikhs on the Gulf such as those of Koweit and Bahrein. I pointed out to him that these Sheikhs were maintained by us, to be independent de jure as well as-ae facto both of Persia and of Turkey, but that we had recognized the Shah’s sovereignty over Mohammerah, though we had no wish to see it emphasized at the expense of the ancient rights long enjoyed under its segis by the Arabs. I then asked him to explain his specific grievances at this particular juncture against the Persian Government, adding that I had hoped that the arrangement negotiated as regards the Customs last year was working smoothly. Sheikh Khazal replied that that arrangement had already begun to be violated. It had been agreed in it that his dates should be free from export duties, and that goods brought by him for his personal use from abroad should he exempt from import duties. The Persian Government were now attempting to make him pay both these classes of duties, and although they had, in consequence of his remonstrances, given in on the subject of the dates, they refused to do so in the matter cf his personal imports. It had been stipulated at the same time that if he accepted a Belgian Customs official, and paid the entire customs revenue over to M. Naus, he should himself remain head of the Customs, and that the Belgian should be, so to speak, his technical assistant. He now found that his position as Chief of Customs was merely nominal; that new clerks were constantly being brought in from Isfahan and Tehran by M. Waffalaert; that the latter officer corresponded over his head with the Central Government; and that it was clear that the Persian Government were bent on gradually paring away his authority, and destroying the prestige on which it rested. He had been induced by the advice ot His Majesty’s Legation to acquiesce in the new customs arrangement, and he wished to know definitely whether we would now support him if the Persian Government repudiated the bargain they had made with him. A long desultory discussion followed, and was continued at a subsequent visit which the Sheikh paid me the same evening, but the upshot of it was that he desired a pledge from us that if, in consequerce of a breach of its engagements by the Persian Govern ment, he declared himself no longer bound by the arrangement negotiated last year, at any rate, unless the Persians adhered to it also, and if as a result of this attitude on his part the Persian Government attempted to depose him or coerce him as a rebel, we would prohibit such action on their part. I explained to him that this meant that if the “ Persepolis ” came up to attack Mohammerah we might conceivably have to send a gun-boat of our own to enforce the prohibition ; that we had already gone a long way in promising to protect Mohammerah against a foreign enemy ; and that to interfere in such a manner between the Sovereign of Persia and a Chief whom we had recognized as his subject would be a strong measure which would be deemed very unfriendly by the Shah, and might react on our general relations with him. He would readily understand that before even expressing any opinion as to the view which His Majesty’s Government would take of such a proposal, I must refer to your Lordship for instructions. Speaking personally, 1 should be glad if I were authorized to support him against any further encroachments or display of bad faith by the Persians, and I would, in writing to your Lordship, place his case fully and clearly before you ; but he must remember that the [1811 t—l] /C 1► npppfogapppp. 2 question of Mohammerah was only a part of a much wider problem. I added that I could not discuss with him our attitude in the.event of certain hypothetical contingencies in relation to which he wanted me to define it, such as the overthrow of the Kajar Dynasty, the break-up of Persia, &amp;c., pointing out that it must necessarily depend upon as yet unknown circumstances and conditions respecting which we could now predicate nothing. ^ A He mentioned incidentally in the earlier part of our conversation that the Russians were quite ready to give promises of protection, and I think it not improbable that if we withhold our support from him, he may be persuaded to enter into some secret arrange ment with them. His Confidential Agent, Haji Reis-et-Tujar, showed me a letter frotn the Russian Consul-General at Bushire promising to visit Mohammerah, and announcing that he had obtained permission from the Shah to confer upon Sheikh Khazal a very high Russian decoration. The letter did not state what the decoration was beyond that it was one usually given to “ Ministers.” It is for this reason that, reluctant as I am to recommend a measure which will certainly exasperate the Shah, I ventured in my telegram of the Hth instant to advise that, in the last resort at any rate, we should be prepared to 'Upport the Sheikh if need be by a forcible demonstration against the Persian Govern ment, and should let him know that we are ready to do so. I would, however, ur^e unon him, and I have intimated that we should certainly require this, to exhaust all the resources of diplomacy and negotiation before taking action which could bring about a rupture. If we decide to inform the Persian Government that we shall not allow the use of coercive measures against the Sheikh, we can, I think, very plausibly, and, indeed, reasonably, argue that our interests in A abistan, and particularly on the Kanin, would be so seriously imperilled by the outbreak of disorder that we cannot be indifferent to the adoption of measures calculated to provoke it. The territory governed by Sheikh J^hazal is one of the few portions of the great united Province of Arabistan and Luristan, nominally ruled by His Royal Highness the Salar-ed-l)owleh, in which our merchants can trade in security. The whole region to the north of Dizful is now closed to them owing to the revolt which the actions°of the Persian Government have occasioned, and the compliance of our Road and Transport Company, with the terms of its Concession, has been made impossible by the existence of a state of anarchy, ti e end of which seems as distant as ever. We cannot be expected to acquiesce in the extension of this deplorable condition of things to the Karun Valley, and we must, therefore, insht that the provisions of the Shah’s Firm m to the Sheikh, and the promises given him by M. Nans, shall be scrupulously adhered to by the Customs Department, and that no further steps shall be attempted of a nature to arouse the suspicion and jealousy of the Arabs. But we may require, in addition to putting f 01 v\aid the above considerations, to intimate pretty plainly that if our advice is disregarded we may have to send a ship to Mohammerah to prevent anv collision between Arabs and Persians. We have already, in a formal note sent about a year ago (I have no means here of giving exact references) to the Persian Government, reserved in diplomatic but unmis- takabie language our right to do so should we judge it necessary. It is, of course, very unlikely that we shall have to speak so strongly to the Persian Government, If the Sheikh is firm —and he will be firm as soon as he feels that he has either the British or the Russian Government at his back—the Persians will probably desist from their efforts to tamper with the arrangement made with him last year, more especially if a hint is conveyed to them that ive are watching the prooress of events at Mohammerah, and may possibly interfere in them. ' We have a very strong position, in view of the fact that we urged the Sheikh two years ago to come to terms over the Customs question with the Persian Government, and that, though we were not formally parties to the Agreement, its acceptance by the Arabs was in the main the result of our advice. This circumstance is. I think, o-enerally known, and at Koweit Sheikh Mubarek told me that he had advised the’sheikh of Mohammerah to resist the Persians rather than submit, but that Sheikh Ghazal had replied that he had yielued owing to the representations of His Majesty's Legation The reopening of the question seems to afford us a favourable opportunity for recovering the confidence in us on the Sheikh’s part which has been shaken by the events of two years ago, and securing his friendship for and dependence upon us against all attempts of our rivals to tamper with it. r ^ Our support would, of course, be conditional upon our advice being followed by him at each stage of his discussion with the Persian Government.
