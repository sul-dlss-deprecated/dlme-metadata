Mr. Faizi was engaged by the Educations. 1 Department of the Bahrain Government as a teacher in January 1943 but his services were dispensed with by the Bahrain Govt: on a charge that he was.making anti-Kuslim propaganda. He is a f oliower ofBhaie M . t ^0 f • 2. He applied for/&amp; job in the P.R.C. in February 1945 (see page 1 of file 1/4) but P.A. finally decided not to engage in the P.R.C. (see P.A's note of feist March). 3. I would li4ce to point out tliat he lias no office experience and I understand that he cannot type. He is a Persian and perhap it would be undesirable to employ him as a Censor clerk as his work is of a confidential nature. Mr. Siddiqi, in addition to censor work, does typing, coding and decoding of telegrams and is at present re-organizing the records of the P.H.G. 4. Major Hickinbotham did not ask for Siddiqi in the P.R.C. as a stop gap but it was a pemanent arrangement and he asked Bushire to send a relief for him in the E.O. May Bushire be informed that Mr. Siddiqi's transfer to ■ P.R.O. should be considered as permanent and an Indian clerk should be sent from Bushire for the E.G.? ^ ^ A.P.A .
