The Government of India had agreed to supply 2.5 million rounds a year for six years, and the file primarily concerns negotiations between the Afghan Government and Imperial Chemical Industries Limited, over the supply of further ammunition.The majority of the correspondence is between Imperial Chemical Industries Limited and the Foreign Office, regarding the quantities of ammunition to be supplied, and price and payment options. The file also contains communications received by the India Office from the British Legation in Kabul (William Kerr Fraser-Tytler), reporting on meetings with the Afghan Prime Minister and War Minister, and commenting on the Afghan Government's arms-supply arrangements and negotiations with arms firms in Belgium and Czechoslovakia.The file also contains a small amount of correspondence (dated 1941) between the India Office, the Government of India External Affairs Department, and the Department of Overseas Trade, regarding a request made by the firm International Traders of Karachi for permission to import British radios into India and Afghanistan.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the end of the correspondence (folio 2).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Chemical Industries</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Afghanistan</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Afghanistan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Afghanistan</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002e4#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002e4#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002e4#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
