Navigation on the rivers of Mesopotamia appears to have been established about the year 1610. From that time the company's vessels went regularly to Basrah under arrange ments with the Pasha, of that place. following article referring to navigation occurs :— “ All English vessels, small or great, shall and may at any time safely and securely come and harbour in any of the seas and ports of our dominions, and likewise may from there depart at their pleasure without detention or hinderanee of any man.” This treaty also regulated the payment of customs dues'; but as Mesopotamia was at the time semi-independent, all the conditions were not observed there, till at length in 1759 Sulei man Pasha of Baghdad issued a boiooroldi ordering the conditions to be observed at Basrah. British ships on several occasions assisted the Governors of Baghdad against their enemies, but our papers do not show that any British vessel went beyond Basrah till 18J\4^ In that year the British Government resolved to establish overland communication with India via Turkish Arabia, and for this purpose two steamers were brought overland from the Mediter ranean to the Euphrates, and there put together and placed under the command of Colonel Chesney. A firman was obtained from the Sultan allowing two steamers to navigate the Euphrates by turns for commercial purposes, and “ as long as it may prove useful to the two powers” {vide Aitchison’s Treaties, Yol. VII, page 15). One of these steamers foundered in the Euphrates, and the other was in 1837 handed over to the East India Company and placed under the command of Lieutenant Lynch. In 1839 three additional steamers were sent out to the Euphrates. These were all heavily armed, and the whole flotilla was placed under the orders of Lieutenant Lynch, who commanded it till it was broken up in 1812. During this time the steamers carried the mails regularly to Baghdad, and on several occasions proceeded far beyond this city without meeting with any objections on the part of the Turkish authorities. In 1841 the Porte granted a new firman for the navigation on the Euphrates in confirma tion of the firman of 1884 and couched in the same terms. In 1842 three of the steamers were withdrawn for service on the Indus, while the fourth, the Nitocris, was placed at the disposal of the Resident at Baghdad, and continued to run on the Tigris, carrying the mails, as well as occasional passengers. Our papers do not show that any special arrangements were made with the Turkish authorities for the steamer placed at the Residents disposal. They probably found it a conve nience, as frequent mention is made of its having carried Turkish officials and other passengers. British merchants had long been accustomed to trade with Baghdad from Basrah; but in 1840 two firms were established at Baghdad, who carried on the trade with Basrah in country boats, some of which belonged to the firms. In January 1661 a treaty was concluded between England and Turkey, in which the Turkish Arabia, precis 1646—1846. In May 1846 the Nitocris was brought to Bom bay in order to be repaired.

Yotre Excellence aura soin de ne rien faire prendre de plus. Le 6 Itebial AJchir 1262. L. (REOUF.) S. This order is not very explicit on the question of navigation rights, but it is somewhat amplified by Sir Stratford Canning’s explanations of the nature of the arrangement arrived at. He wrote on the 25th March 1846 as follows :— British-owned vessels will continue to navigate the waters of Mesopotamia under their national colours equally.whether they are engaged in the foreign or in the internal trade, and they will pay upon the mer chandise which they convey the amount of duties respectively applied to in each case by the Convention of Balli- Liman. In the event of their being employed above the usual ports of entry in the internal traffic of the country, they will be liable to the anchorage duty which is always paid here and which is sanctioned by the capitulations, but instead of paying 12 piastres as levied upon each vessel in the harbour of Constantinople, they will only pay 5 piastres. There is no question of any difference between steam boats and sailing vessels. With respect to vessels built in the country, and owned by subjects of Great Britain, which cannot by our own regulations legally carry the national flag without registration under British authority, they will ndt pay higher duties than those required of the most favored class of natives engaged in the internal trade, but they must be content to navigate like other vessels of the country. Though it is not impossible that such vessels as have hitherto abusively enjoyed the privilege of carrying their national colors may be tacitly allowed through favor to continue the same practice, it would not, I conceive, be proper for any British authority to support a claim which, be the state of the Turkish law what it will, is manifestly at variance with the enactments of our own legislature. The prospects which are opening to our trade in the eastern part of this empire, and the importance which may justly be attached to the free navigation of its great rivers wherever our vessels can find a sufficient depth of water tor that purpose, have made me anxious to place our very natural, though somewhat doubtful, claims upon a sound footing sanctioned by the acknowledgment of the Forte itself. This object could only be gained by frankly admitting such of its pretensions as we could not in fairness or consistency dispute. M hen the Nitocris, as already mentioned, was sent to Bombay for repairs, it was rumoured that she had been finally withdrawn from the rivers. This caused much uneasiness to the merchants at Baghdad, who forwarded a memorial* in which they expressed as their opinion that the security of trade was entirely due to the presence of an armed vessel on the rivers, as the Turkish authorities, even if they were willing to exert them, selves, which was far from being the case, could not possibly afford protection against attacks by the numerous Arab tribes occupying both banks of the river. The Resident at Baghdad, bir H. Rawhnson, fully endorsed this view, and was besides of opinion that the presence of an armed vessel was very necessary for the maintenance of British influence in Turkish Arabia. He had already m the preceding year written as follows on this subject i * Cons. 28th March 1846, No. 113. Note. This memorial aho shows that the vizirial letter of 1846, which hud then just issued, was con sidered as having conferred on ships under British flag full rights of navigation on the Tigris. i 'J; r 3 V f ^. e establishment of wood stations along the course of the river, the Commander is brought into rogn- hu and most friendly communication with the Arab tribes who reside upon the banks.

Hie Comet performed the same duty as formerly, the Nitocris carrying the mails, keeping up relations with the Arab tribes and protecting British trade. This was particularly f Cons. 22nd October 1858, No. 56. useful in 1858, when Arab feuds again rendered the river traffic very insecure.t 8. In the year 1859, Messrs. Lynch and Company contemplated placing a steamer on the Tigris to run between Baghdad and Basrah, and based their right upon the correspondence of 1846 dealt with in the preceding paragraphs. Colonel Kambell, to remove all doubts upon the + No. 53, dated 18tb October, matter, referred J Sir H. Bulwer, then Her Majes ty s Ambassador at Constantinople, to Sir Stratford Canning's despatch of the 25th March 1846 and to the Yizierial letter dated 2nd April 1846, and enquired whether the latter document constituted a sufficient authority for British mer chants to engage in the navigation of the rivers of Mesopotamia, or is a firman or other special sanction necessary. Sir H. Bulwer in his despatch No. 1, dated 13th February 1860, replied as follows: c&lt; The Yizierial letter alluded to could not be considered as conferring any permanent right: such a document, giving in fact merely a temporary permission, might be revoked at any moment by another document of similar character. Nor do I deem it safe, unless the Porte were willing to give some special sanction to that effect, that the Company would be justified in engaging their capital in the navigation of the rivers of Mesopotamia.' He added, however, that his enquiries whether the Porte would be inclined to make such a special grant had resulted in an expression of opinion by the Turkish Foreign Minister that if Messrs. Lynch and Company were to apply for a firman or concession to establish a line of steamers to run between Baghdad and Basrah, the Porte would not be averse from an arrangement of this nature. 10. Upon receipt of Sir Henry Bulwer’s despatch, Messrs. Lynch and Company sub- ^ ^ , „ , , . - T n j i mitted through Colonel Keml all an application§ 21st March 1880 ' for a firman “ granting them the requisite sanction to navigate the rivers of the country with British registered steam vesselsan3 Colonel Kembtdl further intimated ahat Messrs. Lynch and Company intended to commence operations with one steamer, and if the speculation succeeded, to increase the number of their vessels. In reply to the application of Messrs. Lynch and Company the Grand Vizier issued the following letter to the Governor of Baghdad :— ^ • Translation of letter from the Grand Vizier to the Pasha of Baghdad. The British Embassy having recently made certain communications for the purpose of obtaining a renewal of the orders which were sent concerning the British steamer and boats authorised by Her Majesty to ply on the rivers Tigris and Euphrates,-it has appeared from the register that permission having on a former occasion been applied for by it to station two steamers on the river Euphrates at Baghdad and to run them hy turns tor the purpose of facilitating trade, two firmans, dated respectively the end of Shaban 1250 and the beginning of Kejeb w 5 7 ' were addressed to the late Governor-General of Baghdad, Ali Kiza Pasha, authorizing the permanent sta tion of two steamers on that river, providing it were proved and established that the advantage resulting there from would be mutual, and that no sort of inconvenience would ensue. Further that, in virtue of a report receiv ed Aspect in- the dues payable by vessels and boats navigating the Euphrates and Tigris, and in conformity with the reauest of the British Embassy for Vizenal instructions on the ground that British merchant vessels might trade XoL two rivers after payment of the fixed dues according to treaty, and considering that the transport of goods from one point on those two rivers to another without going out to sea is in fact rnternal trade, and that undei tiom one poinr on whatsoever flair it may be, must pay the same dues as Ottoman vessels or boats, ^nd t” ffXerd S aioak and earing one of those two rivers with their and that Jintisn vesse , » Ottoman produce and bound for foreign countries after having cargoes or issuing theiefrom ^ t he'treaty and tariff, are only liable to the payment paid the dues payable on c or ca ^e m 0ne y) on entering or leaving the Tigris and Euphrates of palamar ahtehesi ( i- ■, g othernorts of the Ottoman Empire.

(Sealed) MEHEMED.L 4 ] Thu authorities at Baghdad were, however, opposed to the establishment of steam “ayi- letter, t ie terms to the effect o£ this letter, Mr. Plowden writes * Secret Muy 1882, Nos. 221-272. ag f o n 0WS * : — * * * 14. This further letter silenced for atime the opposition the intention °f the company to piace a second steamei t ^ e C0rreS p 0n cl ence which then ensued that enUtTes^'^d 1 ^to^he^^^ati^onJofThat^fcii^n^the TM^is^a fn fhp British Government for the Euphrates ; and having shown that the teims of that co sanction graidvd to tl^ 1 . , t } iat tvvo steamers—the City of London and the Come#—were as a matter stationed on the Tigris, there was no other conclusion possible but that the firm in question had no right to bring out what was described as a third steamer. One statement m this argument, that the Comet belonged to the Euphrates and Tigris Company, was immediately assailed; and it having been pi oved that this vessef belonged to the Indian Government, the new steamer brought out by the Company, iYie Dejleh, was permitted to run. The Porte, however, gained one important advantage from this discussion. The little mis statement about the Comet diverted attention from the substantial issue, and gave them the opportunity to discard withTt detection the correspondence of 1846 Consequently after that misstatement had been set right with the result that the Company attained their immediate object in view—withdrawal of opposition to the Dejleh noboTy thought it worth while to traverse the far more important assertion that the Company s right to navigate the Tigris rested on a specific finnan applicable to the Company alone and restricted to two steamers And it is a remarkable fact that from the moment the controversy reached this stage the Vizierial letters subsequently granted carefully abstain from any allusions to the arrangement of 184b, which were so distinctly confhmed by the Yizierial letters of 1861 and 1862. 15 Colonel Kemhall,having learned that Manyk Pasha contemplated opposition to the ZteyZeA, drew; His Excellency’s attention to existing arrangements whereby British merchant steamers were at liberty to navigate the Tigris without any limit as to number of vessels, and asked him to specify bis objections. Manyk Pasha replied that in the Vizierial letters preserved in bis archives It was clearly laid down that the British Government was permitted to run only two steamers on the Tigris, and to run them by turns; and as two steamers were now present, he was unable to perceive on what grounds a third steamer could be claimed. Manyk Pasha’s view was firmly supported by bis own Government ; and the correspondence which ensued was persistently conducted by the Turks on the bans that only two steamers were admissible ; that the-e was no distinction between the Company’s steamers the City of London and the Government steamer Comet ; and that no third steamer could be allowed. And the British authorities appear to have been so far convinced of the soundness of the Turkish case, that they seem to have agreed to withdraw the Comet to make way for the Company’s new steamer, the Dejleh. This stage of the controversy terminated with Ali Pasha’s note dated 1st October 1864 , a copy of which was forwarded to Colonel Kemball in a despatch from Her Majesty’s Chargi d’Affaires, No. 17, dated 3rd October. 16. This note, in deciding the question at issue, commenced with a statement that Her Majesty’s Embassy had asked the Porte. “ Que des ordres soient transmis au Gouvcmeur General de Baghdad a 1’effdt de ne pas s’&lt; ation sur le Tigre du nouveau bateau a vapeur que Messieurs Lynch et Co. feront yenir d.e Bond remplaeer le l&lt; Comet” un des deux bateaux sous pavilion Anglais gui ont l autorisation de naviguer sur le dit fleuve. I have no means of knowing whether Ali Pasha quoted correctly the English memorandum; hut it will be obvious from the statements in the foregoing paragraphs of this despatch that the words which I have italicised altogether misrepresent the true position of affairs. Ali Pasha’s note proceeds :— “ Yous savez, Monsieur le Charge d’Affaires, que I’antorisation accordee a cet effet comporte outre la reserve stipulee pour le cas ou des inconvenients locaux seraient signales dans sa mise a execution, la condition expresse que le nombre des bateaux a vapeur destines a cette navigation sera definitivement fixe a deux.' Comma ils’ agit aujour’ dhui de remplacer un des deux bateaux qui font deja le service le Gouvemeur General de Baghdad a re&lt;;u T ordre de ne pas s’opposer a I’amvee du nouveau bateau a condition que celui qu’il est destine a rem placer quitte immediatement le fleuve et que sous aucun pretexte aucun bateau a vapeur sous pavilion etranger en dehors des deux qui y sont autorises ne puisse stationner ou circuler dans les eaux du susdit fleuve. Your Excellency will perceive at once that Ali Pasha recites as applicable to merchant steamers on the Tigris conditions contained in a document which relates solely to the navigation of the Euphrates by two steamers the property of the British Government. 17. Colonel Kemball, in commenting upon this note, pointed out that the Dejleh, which had been con structed for the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, could not have been intended to replace the Comet, which was an armed despatch boat belonging to the British Government Pennission was accordingly obtained to retain the Comet temporarily for the protection of the working parties engaged in constructing the telegraph between Basrah and Baghdad. Subsequently the position of the Comet was further discussed, and the fact established that it was an armed vessel belonging to the British Govern ment and not a private commercial steamer. Finally, in 1869 the Porte agreed that the Comet might le replaced by another vessel belonging to La Marine Tdoyale. This permission was not acted upon at the time, but it has since been renewed. In addition to Mr. Plowden’s note, which gives a summary of the case from 1831-1869, it may be remarked that in 1867 it was seriously considered whether the maintenance of a steamer on the rivers was worth the expense, which amounted to about Rs. 45,000 per annum. The Governor-General was of opinion that the steamer should be withdrawn, but the majority of the Government were of opinion that political reasons made the presence of the steamer necessary, and Her Majesty’s Government agreed in this view. opposer a la navig ondres dans le but de^ Com f ™s by tills time so worn out that it was found impossible to repair her The consent of the Porte was consequently, as remarked by Mr. Plowden, obtained to renW iei y a new vessel; but it was found that the new ship would cost about £6 000 while thp monthly expense for her maintenance would be at least Rs. 3,000. The Government of India, thought that this was too^much; and as, besides, &lt;‘*her presence was avowedly distasteful to the feelings of a faithful ally, they proposed to the Secretary of State that the Comet should be * Political—A— -June 1870 ito. 268-71, * a;c * U P? aiK l tiiat no new vessels should be sent to replace her.

Ihe Government of India also proposed that half the cost of buihlim* and maintenance should be borne by Imperial revenues. 9 n 11 m .t F m e T b i e T f en l tlono(i tliat lt was aeertained on this occasion that the value of Indian tiade with Turkish Arabia amounted to 41 lakhs per annum without counting the tran sactions of the European firms established at Baghdad, t f Political—A—December 187Q, Nos. 421-24, K.W. The Secretary of State did not reply for several years to the proposals made by the Government of India, and it was only in 1880 that it was finally decided to build a new vessel to replace the Comet, the Home Government contributing £ 3,000 towards the cost of buddmg. Meanwhile the Turkish Government had several times asked for the removal ct the Comet, being under the impression that it originally belonged to Messrs. Lynch and Com pany, and maintaining that this firm could not have more than two steamers on the rivers of Mesopotamia. Hie Ambassador at Constantinople succeeded, however, in proving' that the t ProeeecTmgs, May 1875, No. 223. Porte made a mistake in supposing the Comet to ™tMre W their objections^ ^ to 3 ^ “ d In 18S2 it was considered absolutely necessary to replace the Comet ; and as the new ship was not ready, a vessel, the London, was hired for temporary use, but she foundered in the vdiat-el- Arab before reaching Baghdad. Later on it was found that the new vessel constructed at Bombay had been made too large for use on the Tigris. Consequently a second vessel had to be bujlt; and this will probably be ready in 1881. In October 1882, it was proposed to send the Resident a steam launch for use till the ship could be made ready; but no suitable launch could be found, and the matter was moment arily allowed to drop. In March 1883, Mr. Plowden sent a memorandum to the Secretary of State strongly urging the necessity of replacing the Comet early. He thought that the best opportunity for bringing the vessel to Baghdad would be his return to that place in August, and he proposed that no further communication should be made to the Turkish Government. If they objected after the arrival of the vessel, they might be referred to the permission given in 1869. The Secre tary of State forwarded this memorandum to the Government of India for opinion. The new Comet cannot possibly be made ready by the time Mi’. Plowden returns, and it is still for orders whether Ids subsidiary proposal to give him the temporary loan of a vessel shall be sanctioned. That the rivers of Mesopotamia still are unsafe is amply proved by the attack made in 1880 on the mail steamer Khalifah. Two men were killed and one wounded, and the Turks have as yet been unable to bring the perpetrators of the robbery to account. In April last Colonel Tweedie reported that disturbances thickened round Amrah on the left hank of the Tigris, and that the Turkish authorities would find it difficult to restore order, though they protected the mail steamers by placing strong guards on board. Of late the Turkish Government has tried to interfere with all navigation on the rivers of Mesopotamia, They had already in 1874 and 1881 objected to visits paid by British men-of- war to Kurna, which is situated at the junction of the Euphrates and the Tigris, hut in March last they even preferred an objection to the arrival of a man-of-war at Basrah. It will be st en from the preceding note that British ships have at all times since 1640 gone freely to Basrah, and on the occasion mentioned Lord Granville replied that Her Majesty’s Government were not aware of any rules that could prevent men-of-war from going to Basrah. In May, Messrs. Lynch, and Co, wanted to replace an old steamer by a new one; but as the new ship was said to be somewhat larger than the vessel formerly employed, the Wall of Baghdad informed the Resident that Messrs. Lynch and Co. could have only two steamers, and that these must always be replaced by ships of the same size. It was then proved that the tonnage of the new stean*er was somewhat less than that of the former boat, but then the Turkish authorities, acting under instructions from Constantinople, pretended that the steamers were not allowed to run on the Tigris, but only on the Euphrates. This was a re-assertion of their old erroneous view of the case, which confounds the rights granted to the British Government with those granted to a private firm ; but it might just now be inexpedient to insist too much on the difference, as a strict adherence to the letter of the Oiffereat concessions would enable the Turks to exclude the Comet from the Tigris.,o, the 14th June the WaK aske.1 the Resident to prevent the steamers of Messrs. Lynch and Co. from entering the Tigris. Colonel Tweedie replied that tins was a matter of serious importance, which could not be settled locally, and that he would report the case to Govern ment. On receipt of his telegraphic report, the Embassy at Constantinople at once adoiessed Hip Porte on the subject, but no immediate orders were issued, and the vv an threatened to stop the steamers by force. As the question was to be decided at Constantinople, the Government of India did not interfere beyond calling- the attention of Her Majesty’s Government to the case and suggesting that the case of the Comet should be negotiated at the same time. On the &amp;Sth June the steamer Mosoul was prevented from shipping her cargo, and the A-nmt of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company was informed that the steamers would not in future be allowed, to load or discharge. On the same date the Wall informed the Itesident that a telegram from Constantinople prohibited Itnglish steamers from entering the Tigris. In reply, .the Resident once more referred to the negotiations going on at Constanti nople, and asked for delay pending final orders. To this the Wali replied as follows :—■ “ In reply to your letter No. 54 of 28th instant, I have the honor to repeat intimation already made to you that, as Lynch and. Company’s privilege applies to Euphrates only, the Ottoman Government have finally prohibited their Iceeping steamers on Tigris, and that it is therefore impossible to further the views stated in your letter. “ 2. Previous loi ters have informed you that Lynch and Company have permission to run two steamers on the Euphrates, but not on the Tigris. “ Their steamer Mejidwh, which came up to Baghdad from Busra on this occasion, having reached Baghdad before issfie of final orders, will be permitted to discharge her cargo. But I take this opportunity to inform you that final orders have been given to the Captain of our steamer at Gurna, and others ; that henceforward it is requisite that no cargo should he given to Lynch’s steamers ; also that, should they desire to run cn the Tigris and come up again to Baghdad, it will be necessary to obstruct (stand before) them and give them no way to enter the Tigris. , Colonel Twfcedie then called the 'Wall’s attention to the serious consequences which might ensue, if he enforced his orders, a.id to the inconveuienee which would be caused by stopping steamers carrying the English mail. To this the Wali replied that he merely carried out the orders he had received, and that the mails could easily be carried by Turkish steamers. The following, letter from the Agents of Messrs. Lynch and Co. will show the measures subsequently taken by the AN ali:—- Bated 6th July 1883, From—The Manager, Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, To— Colonel W. Tweedie, Officiating Consul-General, Baghdad. We have the honor to report, for your information, that at noon yesterday six Zaptiehs were placed on hoard the S. 8. Mejidieh, and forcibly prevented her taking any cargo or passengers on hoard, or holding any communication with anybody other than the ship’s own crew. At all the usual landing places Zaptiehs were also stationed for a similar purpose. Towards evening the crew were prevented from ta,king their provisions on board preparatory to starting for Busra this morning, and many of them were ill-treated, as also were five grpenters in our pay and employed by us to work in Busra. These latter, after being placed on board by one of your Cavasses, were again turned out of the ship by Zaptiehs, and eventually went on board, as you are aware, with your kind permission, in the mail boat from the Residency. The Commander’s luggage was stopped going on board, and in fact, though we made no attempt whatever to take a single package or passenger, .we were subjected all day to such annoyances by the Zaptiehs that, although ail employed on boaid our steamers have strict orders to avoid any breach of the peace, no matter what happens, we are in constant fear of somebody losing their temper and doing soinething which we should all very much regret, and . which might prove the spark to ignite the intense excitement caused by the action of • the Turkish authorities towards our steamers. We have the honor to bring to your notice the action of the local authorities towards our Steamer Mejidieh which has just left for Busra. Having been verbally informed'by the customs authorities that the above vessel would not be allowed to take in any cargo, we wrote to the Custom House Master oh 3rd instant to know if such was the case, and, if so, the reason for his prohibition, as we had duly discharged the steamer and otherwise conformed with existing regulations. To this letter we received no reply, though we made'application for it. As we aet here as-Agents for this Company, we felt bound to protect ourselves by'giving the usual notice of our intention to ship cargo, and asking permission for it to he passed through the customs. This “ Irzahal ” was returned to our clerk with the answer that it could not be accepted, but any written reply was resolutely refused. Native merchants also were prevented from shipping anything by our steamer, Customs Officer hein’o- sent to-accompany all goods cleared through the customs on board the Turkish steamer Phrat. As described elsewhere, passengers were also forcibly prevented from going on board our steamer, so consequently she left this mormng with Her Britannic Majesty’s mails, quite empty and so light that she is dangerous for navigation. • circumstances, we beg to enter, for such aetiqn as you may deem fit, the strongest protest against thi^ unjustifiable treatment of our steamers which have plied on this river for upwards of twenty-one years, during which time they have always carried any Turkish Government despatches free of charge for wmch we have stopped at all stations on the river. Customs receipts from Busra, Coot, and Amarah, amount ing to large sums, have also been regularly, conveyed without expense# and in short, we have always done all in our power to reciprocate the privilege accorded to us by the Ottoman Government, and which is now threatened to be suddemy wrested from us.

He was, however, of opinion that this contest with the Turkish authorities mi^ht cause a popular rising in Baghdad endangering the life and property of all the Europeans in the town, and he consequently conferred on the subject with the Russian and the French Consuls, The Russian Consul did not consider that there was any danger, and refused to move in the matter, but the French Consul adopted Colonel Tweedie’s views, and promised to address the 'YYali on the subject. The Wali enforced his orders more and more strictly. The steamers from Basra were not allowed to touch land anywhere between Kurna and Baghdad, not even at.their own coaling stations. On their arrival at Baghdad guards were placed on board, and when the mail steamer arrived on the 14-th July, neither crew nor passengers were allowed to land. On the following day Colonel Tweedie wrote as follows with reference to these events and to their effect on public feeling and English prestige :— Extract from Diary for week ending 15th July. 15th July, 6 a. m. —26. Steamer Khalifah is leaving Baghdad, having just dropped down from anchor age, and anchored opposite Residency to wait for mails. I have detained her this week up to latest safe date (Sunday), hoping hourly situation would open. Rumours were rife yesterday that she was to be stopped by violence ; but if the authorities had been really prepared to do so, they would not have said so much about it. 27. It is not impossible that Her Majesty’s Government may think first of the injury to trade (which monev compensation can easily make up) caused by these proceedings ; and only afterwards of the blow now daily being inflicted on our visible (and invisible) power in the presence of all Her Majesty’s native Indian subjects here, and others. In the eyes of these practical and untutored people, it simply looks as if war had broken out between England and the Porte, and the hostilities had for three weeks been ail confined to one side. Of course this a wrong view, but nowhere do appearances go for more than here. 28. Last night I sent the Consular dragoman to His,Excellency the Wali to remonstrate with him, at the last moment, in a friendly rather than official spirit indirectly, and as opening might occur, on his whole proceedings; but particularly and expressly on his having detained on board our two steamers now -here the parcel-mails of the Government of India, thereby reducing me to the necessity of sending back to-day to Busra mails for aught that is known, containing documents or other articles sent to me by my Government. On all points he was firm and determined, though courteous, and what he said about the parcel-mails merely was that he would compel them to go down to Basra and be brought up here again on board a Turkish steamer, 30. As regards these mails, the circumstances reported in this diary will enable the Government of India to decide what, ff any, orders should be issued from time to time to Indian Postal Department touching the continued sending them on towards Baghdad at all. 31. Already, as I am credibly informed, the Ottoman navigational bureau bas, on the strength of our trade havin° r been stopped and all the traffic diverted for a short time into its hands, gieaJy^ larsed its lates for freight much to the disgust of some of the very capitalists and traders who have been conspiring to bring about the present couv. The'truth is, if the navigation of the Tigris between Basra and Baghdad were, by any possihilitv. to fall within the power of Turkish maladministration and rapacity, it would gradually collapse. No capitalists having large ventures would hold themselves very long at the mercy of so uncertain a xovern- rmmt as this. And the trade of the country would subn-de to its pristine channels, namely small native cratts run by people too poor and obscure to think of anything better than getting on as best they could now sub- mitting to extortion ; now evading it through bribery or cunning ; and leading, generally, the precarious lives to which Asiatics are as a rule habituated. Circumstances remained unaltered till the 4th August when Colonel Tweedie telegraphed that the Wali had received orders from Constantinople to suspend measures obstructing the Tigris navigation. Our correspondence does not clearly show the reasons which have moved the Wall to act as he has done of late. Colonel Tweedie thinks that it is a combination of political motives and intrigues started by certain Baghdad merchants who wish to have a monopoly of navigation on the Tigris. His demi-official letter to Mr. Wyrdham of 13th July 1883 gives his views of the case in detail. He is of opinion that the Wali should be removed, as otherwise British prestige will suffer and'fresh complications will certainly arise. The Resident has of late had reason to regret the absence of a Residency steamer, and he calls attention to the difficulties which might have been avoided it the had been calls attenti w fitint it would be well to have a man-of-war stationed at Basra servieeaole. e an&lt; i t h e report from the commander of the Khalifah, dated 8th July, » «,t at all d***.
