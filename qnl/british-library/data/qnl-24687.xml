I fear that possibly it may oe too late now to make I 1 any additions or alterations in the araft, hut in ca.se it is not, ana the Government of India are pleased to approve of them, I venture to make the following suggestions :• (a) Though in^lied it is not clearly stated in the draft that the mails go first to the Residency Post Office and the parcels subsequently go to the custom nouse, it is suggested that this should he mentioned, and also who (i.e., the Post Office or the Customs nepart. me nt) is to bear the cost of transporting the parcels from the Post Office to the Custom House. The Customs have always done this here, but during the last week a dispute has arisen about the matter. (b) No reference is made in the craft to the time-honoured practice i 1practice^giving parcels* to British exeiDpted officers direct ti om the Post Oflice without the said parcels having to go to the Custom House. This practice is much appreciated 'by exempted officers as it avoids much hother and delay ; further, no difficulty is caused to the Custom House as a list of the parcels and their contents is sent to the Director every month - it could he sent after every mail if necessary. (c) In Article 3, hook-packets might he included in articles which may delivered direct as is done at present. There is no duty on hooks, hut if they are sent to the Custom House, expense (o.g. aeclaration fee 2 Krans, stamp fee 15 cents) and delay are caused. Very often if the parcels are not sent to the custom House till Thurjday, it is impossible to get a parcel till Sat urday U) The form of receipt passed hy the customs official under Article (4) should include some statement as to whether the parcels are 'in good conditions' or 'apparently in good condition.' A printed receipt in Government&gt; Government of India, but I beg to observe that, judging from previous experience, the Customs officials will interpret the Agreement strictly in accordance with the letter, and will allow nothing which is not down in black and white. When there was no mention of the fact in the Agreement, nothing would induce an ordinary Persian Customs officer to state on the receipt that the parcels were in good condition, j x In the end of 1904, I suggested that the declara- See Article 7(3) of the ) M Reglement Douanier.' ) tion fee of 2 Krans should be waived in the 4 ' Article 7(4) in ibid. ) case of parcels of small value and only the ’ / charge for n etiquette de controls' made. I am not sure whether a suggestion of this kind can be made in connection with this convention, but it would be a great boon to everybody if the Persian Government would waive this declara tion fee when it exceeds 4 per cent, of the value of a parcel, that is to say, on all parcels of a value of less than 5 tomans* I trust that I am not too laxe in making these proposals, and that the Government of India may be pleased, Gonfidantial, ' 1 “T— No. 4t&gt;7-»S.A., dated Port William., the 2nd March 1910.

It hardly see.ms necessary, therefore, to say this in so many words. disputes, such as the one alluded to hy Major Trevor, arising if a provision were inserted in the agreement as to the incidence of the cost of transport of the parcels from the Indian Post Office to the Persian Customs House. Obviously the charge should fall on the Persian customs Department, and I agree with Major Trevor as to the desirability of inserting in the agreement a provision making this clear. (3) Under Article 27(3) of the 'Reglement Douanier**, concluded between Great Britain and Persia on the 29th August 1904, parcels for British Consulates are exempt from customs formalities. In this connection, I would invite a 132-P., dated the 5th December 1904, and would observe (l) that a provision should apparently be inserted in the ( 1 ) The general tenor of the proposed agreement, and ( 2 ) It would certainly prevent all possibility of reference to paragraph 7 of Sir Arthur agreement* t X See Article Convention agreement to the effect that parcels addressed to 'Exempted” officers are to he delivered hy the post office to the addressees direct, i.e., without the intervention in any way of the Persian Customs House, and (2) that the insertion in the agreement of a list of such 'Exempted' officers would in that case he necessary for the guidance of the Indian post office officials in the matter. ^ (4) .

(gj As regards the recommendation made in paragraph 4 of Major Trevor's letter, no papers on the subject of Major Trevor's previous reference are traceable in my office and the matter does not appear to be one upon which this Department can advise.

Sir, With reference to my telegram No. 8 of February 1st, informing you that action had been suspended in the matter of the proposed arrangement for the Customs treatment of postal parcels arriving at the British-Indian post offices in the Persian Gulf, I have the honour to state that on receipt of Despatch No. 94-3209 from His Majesty's Acting Consul-General at Bushire, enclosing a copy of his Despatch No. 3208 of Decembc r 19th addressed to the Secretary to the Government of India, Pro &gt;t definitif.

As regards (a) an addition in the sense suggested has been appended to instroctiona to ( 6 ) Monsieur Mornard foresees that difficulties would be raised by other foreign j Consular Officers at Bushire, if preferential treatment in the matter of delivering I parcels were accorded to British exempted officers and were expressly laid down in the Regulations. In order, however, to meet the wishes expressed by Major Trevor, Monsieur Mornard is sending instructions to the Customs officers at Bushire (copy enclosed) to deliver direct parcels addressed to the British officers in question, and so to consecrate his acceptance of the practice hitherto observed. (c) As regards book packets, it will be noticed that newspapers, printed matter and books ” are now expressly included in Article 2, which gi ve ® a articles which may be distributd without the intervention of the post. Monsieur Mornard considers that if books arrive in closed packets, as opposed to the ordinary parcelpost, they must be sent to the Customs House to be verified m the same way as other exempted articles. He trusts, however, that the addition to Article 2 will meet all requirements. (d) The words M en bonnes conditions apparentes ” have now been added to Article 4. This addition has necessitated the inclusion of the subsequent paragraph relating to the treatment of damaged parcels which forms a further addition to the same article.

He adds that it is understood that the exception in question is intended to apply not to a few specimens of paper-money or public funds transmitted by letter, but to the transmission of paper-money or public funds forming the obiect of a commercial transaction. He trusts that the Director- General, having tcahen note of this reservation, may see his way to accepting the restriction in question, and that the various points at issue now being agreed upon it may be possible to proceed without delay with the signature of the agreement I am.

I have the honouj/to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with your telegram No. S.-539, dated the 4th September 1908, on the subject of the British Indian Post Offices on the Persian Coast of the Gulf. It is unnecessary for me to recapitulate the steps by which the Indian Post Offices on the Persian Coast from being Inland offices became offices working under modified Postal Union rules. 1 may mention, however, that it has always been an understood thing in the Indian offices that local letters bearing Persian stamps are not accepted, the Postmaster in the recent case was, therefore, only acting according to precedent. I be^ to call the attention of the Government of India to one result of our Post offices accepting local letters from the Persian Post Office, which may have escaped attention. The Persian/Post Office propose {vide letter from M. Deville, Inspector-General of Posts, No. 86, dated 29th June 1908, attached) to accept all letters whether registered or not up to two hours before sunset on Sunday afternoons. Avery large amount of the correspondence from Bushire is regis tered and the Registered Post is closed in the British Post Office on Saturday afternoons. I am inclined to think that a good deal of this correspondence will be attracted to the Persian Post Office, as all offices here are open on Sunday and the firms will be glad to get an extra day to dispose of their correspondence. In view of this fact I venture respectfully to suggest that the question of opening the British Post Office on Sunday raised in my letter No. 91 dated the 18th February 1905, and negatived by the Government of India in the Foreign Department litter No. 1906-E.B., dated the 20th May 1905, may be reconsidered. The cost of the Persian Gulf Mail service is entirely borne, I understand, bv the Indian Government, and in view of this fact it seems advisable to retain ll preata proportion of the receipts as possible. Perhaps, when the new arrange ment is in force, British Post Offices may be permitted to accept letters for other places in Persia where there are British Post Offices. Bouchire ; le 29 Juin 1908 .

Provided the Persian Government are willing to negotiate a satisfactory Parcels Convention and to make such other concessions as you may think it advisable to ask of them, the Government of India consider that it is unnecessary to maintain the present practice of requiring ' Indian stamps to be affixed to all articles posted at places in the Persian Gulf where there are Indian Post Offices for transmission to Foreign Countries.

Lord Lansdowne's despatch No.85 of 17th June, 1905 was handed to Monsieur Naus on July 18th of last year and in spite of constant and urgent appli cations for a reply, an answer has only lately reached me. You will see that the Persian Government do not refuse to accept the arrangement proposed in Lord Lansdowne's ahove despatch. They however point out that Persian subjects living in the south are obliged to stamp letters addressed to India with British In- ' Edward Grey, &amp;c., &amp;c.. Bart., M.P. , osC. dianIndian stamps and that letters for India stamped with Persian stamps are forwarded via Enzeli, ^ssia and Pgypt. The Mushir ed Dowleh points out that the present arrangement inflicts loss on the Persian Ex chequer and much inconvenience and asks that letters addressed to India, and furnished with Persian stamps should he accepted hy the British Post Offices in the southern Persian ports. I do not know how far the arrangement, of which the Mushir ed Dowleh complains, is in accordance with the Articles of the Postal Union, hut it appears to me that the Persian Government have a legitimate grievance. I have &amp;c. , (Signed) Evelyn Grant Duff.Mushir ed Dovvleh to Mr. Grant, Duff. April 7th, 1906. I have seen the memorandum you have handed to Monsieur Priem, the Director of Customs and Posts in connection with the parcels coming by the English post. I do not refuse to accept it and put it into execution since I have not seen in it anything against the postal union now in force. I do not consider it superfluous to explain the present posi tion of Persian Post Offices in the ports of the Per sian Gulf towards those of British India. The posi tion is that the postal authorities of British India refuse to accept and carry letters bearing Persian / stamps handed over to them by the Persian post. Under these circumstances people living in those re gions are obliged to have their letters stamped with English stamps because if the letters bear Persian stamps they must be sent via Bushire, Isfahan,Tehran, Enzeli, Russia and Egypt and they have to traverse a distance six times greater than they ought to. Un der this arrangement letters going to India from the Ports of the Persian Gulf must bear Indian stamps8-j.iJ. this is o, great Xoss to the Persian Government. ihis poino must be consiciereci. It is cLesirahle that //hen the parcel post agreement is put in force people should receive permission to stamp their letters with Persian stamps if they like, and eat the same time the postal authorities of British India should he in structed oo accept sucn letters from Persian Postmas ters when they exchange the post, and deliver them to their destinations according to Article 1 of the Postal Union of 1897.

(No- 29 -) llyltkfll, M Sir, Tehran, February 1 , 1906. ^ I HAVE the honour to inclose copy of a despatch from the Government of Indiay ' received by me in November 1905, regarding the British post-offices in the Persian Gulf. As I reported in my telegram No. 17, Lord Lansdowne’s despatch No. 85 of the 17th June, 1905, was, by Sir A. Hardinge’s instructions, handed by me in origiual to M. Nans in July 1905, and since then, in spite of many applications, I have been unable to get a definite reply from the Customs Department. Before leaving here in October 1905, AI. Naus verbally informed me that he had been so heavily engaged that he had had no time seriously to study the question, but he said that, personally, he saw no objection to an agreement regarding the parcel post on the lines proposed by Lord Lansdowne. He added that he would discuss the matter fully with me on his return to Tehran in January. I waited before sending you the inclosed despatch till I could receive a definite answer, hut M. Naus shows no sign of returning to Persia. The Administrator of Customs has now telegraphed to his Excellency, and has promised me an answer in a few days. On the 19th January the Government of India telegraphed for my views, and I replied that I concurred in the opinion that, although the postal rights claimed for our post-offices in the Persian Gulf are somewhat anomalous when judged by the rules of the Postal Union, these post-offices occupy a privileged position which ought not to he judged by, or made to conform with, the rules observed by other nations. I added that I thought the negotiations should be limited to an agreement in regard to the parcel post. M. Naus will attend the Postal Conference at Rome, and although he appeared personally ready to come to an agreement, it is possible that the Persian Government, who resent the fact that we have post-offices in the Persian Gulf, may have given him instructions to raise the question of their existence. I understand that Lord Lansdowne’s instructions refer only to the parcel post, and that no Postal Convention is contemplated by His Majesty’s Government. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) EVELYN GRANT DUFF. Inclosure in No. 1. c Government of India to Sir A. Hardmge. ‘ (Confidential.) Simla, September 19, 1905. I AM directed to invite attention to the correspondence ending with your despatch dated the 19th May, 1905, regarding the British post-offices in the Persian Gulf. 2. On the 8 th June, 1905, the Secretary of State for India telegraphed that you were heini? authorized to conclude, in consultation with the Government of India, an arrangement with the Persian Government on the lines of the procedure which is observed at Constantinople in regard to parcel mails from the United Kingdom. But in your despatch of the 19th May, 1905 (above quoted), it is stated that M. Naus desires to conclude a Postal Convention with the Government of India, and would like a representative of the Indian Post Office to be sent to negotiate or assist in the negotiation of it. 3, Before coming to a decision on M. Naus’ suggestion, the Government ol India desire that the following considerations be laid before vou:— [1845 L-17]■i They fully realize that the postal rights claimed foi the Biitish pos L -ofnces in the Persian Gulf‘(which question would presumably come within the scope of such a general Postal Convention as is suggested) are somewhat anomalous when judged by the rules of the Postal Union. But, at the same t.me, their contention is that, for historical reasons, these post-offices occupy a privileged position which ought not to he iudged by, or made to conform to, the rules observed by other nations that this is also your view is deduced from the terms of your telegram dated the 15th February, 1905 5 i n these circumstances, it is arguable that the Government of India would he gratuitously abandoning their present advantageous position if their rights were to lie formulated in a Postal Convention as desired by M. ^Naus, and it would appear to be more consistent with Indian interests to limit the negotiation to the conclusion of an arrangement with the Persian Government m regard to parcel mails only. By adopting 'this course not onlv would embarrassing questions be avoided as to the legitimate character of the‘rights claimed by the British post-offices, hut His Maiesty’s Legation might be able to carry on negotiations without the assistance of an Indian official, doubtful points not elucidated by the information received from Constantinople being referred to the Government of India^ for advice. The Government of India would he glad to he favoured vith youi opinion on this point. 6 . Should yon, after consideration of these points, hold that the conclusion of a general nostal arrangement is still desirable, the question of the deputation of an Indian official to Tehran would have to he considered. The question is one of some difficulty, since the only officers of the Indian Postal Department who possess the requisite qualifications for duty of this kind are not available. I am therefore to request vour views on the following alternative suggestions as to the measures that might he taken :— (a.) Matters might stand over at present, and the opportunity of the International Postal Congress next year might he taken to arrange for an informal discussion of the postal questions involved between M. Nans and the representatives of the Indian Post Office. This would enable us to ascertain what M. Naus’s views really are, and would clear the way for the drawing np of a Convention on lines which could he laid down by Government after receiving the report of our postal delegates. If this suggestion should he accepted, then it could no doubt be arranged thai the status quo should he maintained until the new Convention or Agreement is entered into. (&amp;.) If, on the other hand, yon should consider it desirable, for political reasons, to enter into negotiations at once, the difficulty as to the selection of a postal officer might he overcome by an officer of the Indian Political Department being deputed to Tehran to negotiate, or assist in the negotiation of, a Convention, after having received a course of instruction from the Indian Postal Department in all necessary points. In view of the large political element that enters into the present question, it might even he held that the Government of India would he more suitably represented by a political than a postal official. In that case, it might be useful to obtain a preliminary assurance from M. Nans in writing to the effect that the proposed negotiation would be conducted on the basis of the continuation of the rights at present claimed for the British post-offices in Persia. These alternatives are submitted for your consideration and advice; but the Government of India do not conceal the reluctance with which they would approach any negotiations that might conceivably result in the curtailment or abrogation of privileges which they at present enjoy.

HAUDINGE, K.C.B., K.C.M.G., HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S ENVOY EXTRAORDINARY and MINISTER PLENIPOTENTIARY at the COURT of PERSIA, TEHRAN. Dated Simla, the 19th September 1905. Sir, I am directed to invite attention to the correspondence ending with your despatch No. 30, dated the 19th May 1905, regarding the British Post Offices in the Persian Gulf. 2. On the 8 th June 1905, the Secretary oi State for India telegraphed that you were being authorised to conclude, in consultation with the Govern ment of India, an arrangement with the Persian Government on the lines of the nroeedure which is observed at Constantinople in regard to parcel mails from the United Kingdom. But in your despatch of the 19th May 1905 (above quoted), it is stated that Mons. Naus desires to conclude a Postal Conven tion with the Government of India, and would like a representative^ ol the Indian Post Office to be sent to negotiate or assist in the negotiation ot it. 3. Before coming to a decision on Mons. Nans’ suggestion, the Govern ment cf India desire that the following considerations be laid before you. 4. They fully realise that the postal rights claimed for the British Post Offices in the Persian Gulf (which question would presumably come within the scope of such a general Postal Convention as is suggested) are somewhat anomalous when judged by the rules of the Postal Union B^t at the same time, their contention is that, for historical reasons these Post Offices occupy a privileged position which ought not to be judged by, or made to conform to, the rules observed by other nations. That this is also your view is deduced from the terms of your telegram No. 22, dated the loth February 190o. 5 . In these circumstances, it is arguable that the Government of India would be gratuitously abandoning their present advantageous position, it t eir rights were to be formulated in a Postal Convention as desired by Mons. INaus, and it would appear to be more consistent with Indian interests to limit the negotiation to the conclusion of an arrangement with the Persian Go^ em inent in regard to parcel mails only. By adopting tins course not only would embarrassing questions be avoided as to the legitimate charactei of the rights claimed by the British Post Offices, but His Majesty s Legation might be able to carry on negotiations without the assistance of an Indian official, doubtful points not elucidated by the information received from Constantinople being referred to the Government of India for advice. The Government of India would be glad to be favoured with your opinion on this point. 6 . Should you, after consideration of these points, hold that the conclusion of a general postal arrangement is still desirable, the question of the deputation &lt;* fo r l' W \ ' ‘ V- *of an Indian official to Tehran would haye to be considered. The question is one of some difficulty, since the only officers of the Indian Postal Department who possess the requisite qualifications for duty of this kind are not available. I am therefore to request your views on the following alternative suggestions as to the measures that might he taken :— (a) Matters might stand over at present, and the opportunity of the International Postal Congress next year might be taken to arrange for an informal discussion of the postal questions involved between Mons. Naus and the representatives of the Indian Post Office. This would enable us to ascertain what Mons. Nans’ views really are, and would clear the way for the drawing up a Convention on lines which could be laid down by Governing after receiving the report of our postal delegates. If this st gges- tion should be accepted, then it could no doubt be arranged that the status quo should he maintained until the new Convention or agreement is entered into. on the other hand, you should consider it desirable, for political reasons, to enter into negotiations at once, the difficulty as to the selection of a postal officer might he overcome by an officer of the Indian Political Department being deputed to Tehran to negotiate, or assist in the negotiation of, a Convention, after having received a course of instruction from the Indian Postal Depart ment in all necessary points. In view of the large political element that enters into the present question, it might even be held that the Government of India would he more suitably represented by a political than a postal official. In that case, it might he useful to obtain a preliminary assurance from Mons. Naus in writing to the effect that the proposed negotiation would he conducted on the basis of the continuation of the rights at present claimed for the British Post Offices in Persia. These alternatives are submitted for your consideration and advice: but the Government of India do not conceal the reluctance with which they would approach any negotiations that might conceivably result in the curtail^ ment or abrogation of privileges which they at present enjoy.

No. 416, dated Bushire, the 10th December 1904. From— Captain A. P. Trevor, for Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to correspondence ending with Mr. Grant Duff’s telegram No. Ill, dated 3rd December 1904, regarding the seizure of the British mails by the Customs authorities, Bushire, 1 have the honour to forward, for the informa- No. 177 , dated loth December 1904 . tion of the Government of India, a copy ot the despatch, marginally noted, which I have addressed te His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Tehran, on the subject. No. 177, dated Bushire, the 10th December 1904. From— Captain A. P. Trevor, First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Tehran. I have the honour to report in detail the incident of the seizure of His Majesty’s mails by Mons. Waffelaert, the Belgian Director-General of Customs here. The main facts have already been reported by telegram {vide correspondence ending with my telegram No. 116, dated 8 th instant). 2. You informed me in your telegram No. 93, dated 21st October, that the Ministry of Customs had made a formal complaint against the British Post Office that Mons. Lavers wished to introduce certain new arrangements for delivery of the mails, and that you had requested him to wait, until the Govern ment of India had been able to give their views, hefere agreeing to any change in the present arrangements. 3. On the 22nd November, Mons. Wagner (in charge of the Customs Office) asked me to introduce the new system. I informed him that the matter was under discussion between the Persian Government and the British Legation. He was satisfied with this, and made no attempt to stop the mail which arrived on the 23rd November. 4 . Mons. Waffelaert, however, on his return from tour, immediately took up the matter, and wrote to me on the morning of the 1st December, saying that he had received detailed instructions from the Ministry of Customs, and that Mons. Lavers stated that the British Legation had promised to send urgent orders to me to introduce immediately the system as detailed in his letter. 5. 1 attach a copy of Mons. Waffelaert’s letter, from which you will see that the new system, as understood by m. Wagner’s letter No. 830 also enclosed. ^he Customs Department, involves an examination of the letters by the Customs as well as the parcels, and also the opening of the entire mails at the Custom House, and delivery of parcels through the agency of the Persian Post Office. 6 . I cannot express too strongly my view of the undesirability of such a plan. As long as we maintain British Post Offices in the Gulf, the mails should, in my opinion, be opened at the Post Offices, and nowhere else. This is the rule at the Post Offices in Basrah and Baghdad. 7. I replied to Mons. Waffelaert the same day, saying that no instruc tions had been received by me to introduce any new system with the mails, and that therefore I could not do so. 8 . Mons. Waffelaert then wrote suggesting that I should introduce the new system under protest. I replied immediately, saying that, as I had no instructions, I could not alter a system which had been in force for years, and that 1 proposed to send down the usual escort to bring up the mail, and I trusted that, in the circumstances, Mons. Waffelaert would not obstruct.2 9. On the afternoon of the 1st December, and which was a very wet and windy day, I sent the usual escort of one non-commissioned officer and three men to the Customs to bring up the mail. After some time I received intimation that they bad been stopped and detained. I then went and saw Mons. Waffelaert, and explained to him personally my inability to alter the present procedure without instructions. I added that 1 had received none, and proposed to carry out the old system unless Mons. Waffelaert cared to prevent my doing so by force. 10 . Mons. Waffelaert showed me his instructions from Mons. Lavers. The telegram began with the words—“ The British Legation has promised me to send urgent orders to Bushire to introduce immediately the new postal arrangements, &amp;c. ”, or words to this effect, and continued by giving the new arrangements in detail. Mons. Waffelaert no doubt thought that, when I said I had received no instructions, I was not stating the truth, and said he had no option but to carry out his orders. 11 . I then went down and told the mail clerk to proceed as usual. I think that I could have easily marched off the guard with the mails if it had not been for the lack of hamals, all of whom had been excluded from the Custom premises. There were about 40 bags, some of which were heavy and hamals were absolutely necessary. As it was, the mail clerk got a casual bystander to take up a parcel mail bag, but the man was stopped at the gate. The Director- General had the gates closed and extra sentries posted, and one Mr. Lucas, an Armenian, the “ Hamal Bashi”, was very much in evidence ordering every one about and behaving in a very insolent way. 12. As the day wras very windy and wet and a dhow had just gone down coming from the ship, I decided not to send the mail back to the ship or leave it on the quay in charge of the guard, as the contents of the bags w r ould he damaged in any case. When the Customs bagan to seize the parcel mails, there fore 1 told the guard not to resist. Ten cases and six bags were seized and locked up. 13. Under the existing system the mail officer of the steamer takes the receipt of the British Postmaster, and I had to give the steamer Agents an indem- nity against loss, and ow ing to the three hours’ delay at the Customs House and to lormalities connected with the receipts for the mails, the Boyal mail steamer ” Kassara was delayed and missed the tide. She w r as consequently delayed more than 12 hours. When 1 have ascertained from the British India Steam Navigation Company what amount of demurrage is due, I propose to put in a claim against the Customs Department for the amount, which 1 trust you will support. J 14. I also beg to suggest that the Customs should pay some compensation for the detention of the parcels mails for six days, and that Mons. Lavers and Mons. W affelaert should each make an apology in the presence of a repre sentative of the Persian Government for their unwarrantable action in detaining His Majesty’s mails. • 16 ‘ I x have alread y reported telegraphically (my telegram No. lid, dated bth instant) that the mail was handed over at the British Post Office by Mons. vv agner and Mr. Lucas (Hamal Bashi) on the morning of the 8 th of December. * l 6 / addition to the stoppage of the English mails, I beg to mention ia i le ? ca mai . s air iving on the 4th and 5th of December were detained, until an official of the Customs had seen that there were no parcels. • ^ V ^ 11 accordance with the usual custom, as specie is generally received in the local mails, a guard of one non-commissioned officer and two men went to the Customs to fetch the mails to Post Office on the 4 th of December. 18. The Havaldar (Indian Sergeant), in charge of the party, reported to me that, when he went down to the Customs with the escort, the Hamal Bashi, ,, | iUcas &gt; detained him and tried to take possession of the mails. The Havaldar refused to deliver them over, and sent one of his men to me. Mr. Lucas then abused the Havaldar in Persian, which he did not understand, called him a “ d d fool”, and made use of several other opprobrious epithets.. 19. I see no reason to doubt the Havaldar’s statement, supported as it is by that of the sepoy who was posted as a sentry on the mail hag, though doubt less Mr. Lucas would deny the whole incident. 20. There can be no doubt that Mr. Lucas obstructed the mail escort, and in any case I do not understand what Mr. Lucas, who is supposed to be simply an agent for landing and delivering cargo, bad to do with the matter at all, and his interference with an escort of His Majesty’s Indian Army seems to be quite uncalled for, and in my opinion deserves punishment. 21 . I submit that the action of the Customs Department throughout this affair shows that they consider themselves at liberty to do anything they like, and do not think that they are responsible for their actions to the Persian Government or any one else, and I trust that strong action may he taken to induce them to see the error of their views. 22 . Prom your telegram No. 114 I understand that a temporary arrange ment has been arrived at, and I trust that no alteration will be made until the Government of India and the Resident have had an opportunity of discussing the new system. I notice that the instructions telegraphed to Mons. Waffe- laert differ a good deal from those conveyed in your telegram No. 114, but I have suggested to Mons. Waffalaert that, as a temporary arrangement, all parcels except those for officers exempted by the K&amp;glement should go to the Customs House, and that parcels for such officers should be inspected by Mons. Wagner, whom Mons. Waffelaert has deputed to be present at the opening of the mail bags at the British Post Office. No. 866 , dated the 1 st December 1904. From— Monsieur E. Waffelaert, Director-General of Customs, To—C aptain A. P. Trevor, First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In reply to your letter No. 1461 of the 28th ultimo, I have the honour to imform you that the telegraphic instructions received from my Head Office inform me that His Britannic Majesty’s Legation had promised to send urgent instructions to the Consulate-General here, and order the immediate enforce ment of the new postal arrangements communicated to you in my letter No. 830, dated 23rd ultimo. I beg to request, therefore, that you will be good enough to issue orders for the mail bags due to arrive to-day being delivered to my Department. No. 830, dated the 23rd November 1904. From— Monsieur A. Wagner, /or Director-General of Customs, To Captain A. P. Trevor, First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to bring to your notice that I have received telegraphic instructions intimating that, according to the last paragraph of Article 27 of the R&amp;glement Legal, all postal bags addressed to the Indian Post Office of this town must be handed directly into the Custom House from the mail steamer. After careful and due examination of the postal packages by the Persian Customs and Post, in the presence of an employe deputed by the Indian Post Office, only the bags containing correspondence will be made over to the Indian Post Office, while all parcels and samples and all bags containing sue!/ will be kept back in the Customs House, which will pass through the Persian Post Office a receipted list of such bags to the Indian Post Office. The same rule only in a contrary sense is to be applied to mail bags sent out by the Indian Post Office. In view of the above, I request that you will be good enough to give the needful instruction to the Indian Postmaster with a view to causing him to4 comply with the stipulation of the Article of the Efcglement referred to above, and to give effect to it for the next arriving mail. I beg further to solicit the favour of your causing instructions to the same effect to he issued for your Lingah and Bunder Abbas Offices. Enclosure No. 2. No. 1182 E.-A., dated Fort William, the 20th March 1905. From—The Officiating Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To -Sib Arthur Habdinge, K.C.B., K.C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. In connection with the question of Postal Parcels arrangements now under discussion with the Persian Customs Department, I am directed to invite your attention to the attached copy of a letter No. 419, dated the 31st December 1904, from the Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the subject of Sample Post packages. 2. It will be seen that the avowed object of the Customs authorities at Bushire in putting forward the request referred to is to maintain a check on the importation of dutiable articles by means of the Sample Post, and it is observed that Article 27 ( 8 ) of the Reglement Douanier expressly secures to the Customs authorities the right to examine samples imported into Persia; the proposal therefore appears to amount to a request that effect should be given to this provision. 3 . On the other hand, I am to point out that, by the practice of the Postal Union, bond fide samples of merchandise possessing no saleable value, are transmitted as part of the letter mail. The present request therefore involves a departure from the Union practice, and for no adequate cause. The Indian Postal administration know of no reason for thinking that the sample post is being used for the evasion of the Customs duty. Nor has any similar request been made by the Turkish Government in relation to the Post Offices at Basrah and Baghdad. 4. Eor the above reasons the Government of India think it probable that the request is only being made as a stepping stone to a further demand that the letter mail also should be examined by the Customs authorities on the plea that some letters may contain articles which are liable to duty, and consider that there are good grounds for resisting the proposal.

Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In connection with the question of Postal Parcel arrangements now under discussion with the Persian Customs Department and Government, I have the honour to refer to the case of “ Sample Post” packages. 2. The British Indian Postal authorities regarding bond fide samples as of no saleable value; and in order to promote trade, despatch small articles in the same mail bags as the ordinary letters. Mons. Waffelaert takes exception to this on the grounds that the practice facilitates “ abuses which may be committed by the despatch per Sample Post of parcels containing valuable articles under declaration of tc samples without value ”, and demands that sample packets be enclosed with other parcels in separate bags. 3. I have expressed my inability to make any modification in the existing postal arrangements in this connection, until the question has been submitted7 Enclosure No. 4. (Confidential.) No. 3561 E.-A.

No. 368, dated Bushire, the 3rd (received 14th) August 1905. From— Major P. Z. COX, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—-S. M. Fraser, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to invite reference to my letter No. 428, dated 24th De cember 1904 , to your address on the subject of the exemptions enjoyed by mem bers of the Residency from Customs duty on postal parcels. 2. In statement B, accompanying that communication, I gave a list of those officers who had hitherto been exempted from Customs duty altogether, and were understood to be still so entitled under Article 27 (3) of the R&amp;glement Douanier. Among these were the Residency Surgeon and the Extra Assistant Resident. It will be remembered that on receipt of a copy of that letter from me, Sir Arthur Hardinge despatched a telegram to the Government of India and myself on 15th February, in the course of which he pointed out that he had already claimed that the British Post Offices vrere outside the scope of the R&amp;glement; and went on to express the opinion that we could if desired maintain that view by forcible means. His Excellency added however that he had informed the Persian Government that he was quite willing to discuss some special arrangement with them and to forward it for the views of the Government of India. There the matter rested for the time ; but on the 9th April Monsieur Heyns- sens, the new Director-General of Customs, intimated tome officially that he had been instructed to levy Customs duty hereafter from the Residency Surgeon and the Extra Assistant Resident. Informally however he was good enough to agree to withhold action on his instructions for a time sufficient to enable His Majesty’s Minister to endeavour to get the orders withdrawn. This His Excellency has been unable to ! do ; and I attach for information copies of the final telegrams exchanged Resident to Minister No. 108 , dated 30th July between US OU the Subject. *905. Minister to Resident No. 64, dated 31st July 1905. The Director-General of Customs has likewise informed me, under date J“'y 3 1st, that he can no longer suspend action on his orders, and that the postal parcels of the two officers mentioned must henceforth be sent to the Customs House with those of other non-exempted persons. Under the circumstances I cannot do otherwise than comply, but while thanking him for his courtesy in withholding application of his orders so long, I have added that as I am still in correspondence with higher authority on the subject, I beg that he will regard my compliance as “ under protest ” pending final settlement. 3. I beg respectfully to point out to the Government of India in this con nection that this refusal on the part of the Customs authorities to admit the exemption of the Residency Surgeon and the Extra Assistant Resident from Customs duty generally, as well as to the denial to them of the privilege of receiving their postal parcels direct from the Post Office, has two aspects— {a) It is a surrender to Article 27 of Reglement in the case of two offici als who have always been considered hitherto entitled to exemption. This is perhaps unavoidable in view of our acceptance of the Regle ment. (£) It practically ratifies the provisional arrangement agreed upon be tween the Legation and the Grand Vizier, as intimated in Mr. Grant Duffs telegram of 5th December last, and referred to in paragraph 4 of my letter No. 498 of 24th December above quoted.In regard to (d) t the case of the Residency Surgeon will, I hope, be covered by any action that may be taken on my letter No. 124, dated 1 ith March 1905, recommending the endowment of certain Residency Officials with Diplomatic or Consular rank. Those suggestions did not however provide for the Extra Assistant; I trust therefore that the Government of India will see their way to act upon Sir Arthur Hardinge's proposal by moving His Majesty’s Foreign Office to gazette Mr. ]. P. Sequeira, “ on vacating the post of Vice-Consul at Bushire, to be Assist ant Secretary to His Majesty’s Consul-General/' or by putting him in the Gov ernment of India Gazette as Assistant Secretary to the Resident in the Persian Gulf. I may add that my Russian Colleague’s two Assistants are designated in this way, Secretary and Assistant Secretary, so that there will be nothing unusual in the course. 4. With regard to the concluding sentence of paragraph 4 of my letter No. 428 and to Statements B and C in connection therewith, I am not sure whether or not His Majesty’s Minister has taken any separate action on that communica tion ; but as the case of the Extra Assistant has now become separated, and, as it were, a link between Statements B and C, I venture to hope that if any means suggest themselves to the Government of India of getting the Extra Assistant exempted by designating him Assistant Secretary ; the case of the Superintendent of the Residency in the first place, and if possible the other individuals included in Statement C may be provided for at the same time by their being gazetted “ Dragoman ” to their respective Chiefs. 5. With reference to aspect ( 3 ), I can only repeat what I have said above, that it seems to be a ratification of Mr. Grant Duff’s arrangement, and an admis sion that the case of the British Post Offices in the Persian Gulf falls within the scope of the R&amp;glement, a position which I understood from Sir Arthur Hardinge's telegram of 15th February we were in no way called upon to con cede. 6. In conclusion, I beg the Government of India to take into their final consideration the whole question of our privileges in connection with the British Post Offices in the Persian Gulf—in case any grounds for further demur may be held to exist.

Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 368 of the 3rd August, on the subject of the exemption of members of the Residency from Customs duty generally, including that on postal parcels sent through the British Post Office. 2 . The Government of India approve your action in informing the Direct or-General of Persian Customs’at Bushire that you only agreed, under protest, to the provisional payment of Customs dues on the postal parcels pending the conclusion of an agreement on the whole subject between the British and Persian Governments. 3. As regards the question of Customs duty generally, the case stands on a different footing, and the Government of India are unable to claim for their officers a position of special privilege. It seems clear, however, from the terms of Article 27 of the R&amp;glement Douanier that the Pirst Assistant and the Residency Surgeon will he exempt from duty as soon as their appointments as Vice-Consul de carriere have been officially notified to the Persian Govern ment. 4. In the case of the Extra Assistant Resident, it will probably suffice for His Majesty’s Minister to notify formally to the Persian Government that Mr. Sequeira has been appointed “ Secretary to His Majesty’s Consul-General for Ears, Khuzistan, and Laristan, and the district of Lingah, and for the Coasts and Islands of the Persian Gulf being within the dominions of Persia ”, in accordance with the terms of the Reglement Douanier. Enquiries might he made on the subject of Sir A. Hardinge, and, if he concurs, the notification might be made by him simultaneously with that of Captains Trevor and Condon as Vice-Consuls. A similar course, if the Minister sees no objection, might be followed hereafter in regard to the Second Assistant Resident, should His Majesty’s Government approve the proposal* which has recently been made for the appointment of this additional official. 5 . The Government of India see no objection to the principal ministerial officer at each of the British Consulates in the Gulf being styled Dragoman, or to this appellation being extended at Bushire to the two senior officers of this class. The point, however, is one which you should refer to the Legation for the orders of His Majesty’s Minister. * Vide letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 79, dated the 12th •'ebruary 1905.

This practice was adopted with the knowledge of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whose concurrence was conveyed to the Postmaster General in a letter dated the 1st of May 1897. I am to add that the question of the treatment of parcel mails at Constantinople was 'brought again under the notice of the Secretary of State in 1901 in connection with the proposals which were then under consideration for negotiating a Commercial Treaty with Turkey; and in the Post Office letter of the 27th of August 1901 the Foreign Office was asked to acquaint the Postmaster General of the result of the negotiations then in progress, so that steps might he taken accordingly. To this letter no reply seems to have been received, other than the Foreign Office letter of the 29th of July 1902, whichBRITISH PORT OFFICE, CONSTANTINOPLE. April 15th, 1905.

Nans respecting recent interference by the Customs officials at Bushire with the mail-bags for the British post-office. I have not troubled your Lordship with the detailed report of this affair sent to me by Captain Trevor, as it merely amplified information already given to vou by Mr. Grant Duff, and reproduced in my inclosed note of the 12th January to M. iSaus. Captain Trevor suggested that both M. Lavers, who acted for M. Naus during the latter s absence, and issued the orders which led to the seizure of the mail-bags, and M. Waffelaert, Acting Director of Customs at Bushire, should be made to tender formal apologies for their conduct, but I did not think it advisable to press for this without being certain that your Lordship would desire me to do so, as I felt sure that the Persian Government, which considers that their officers were supporting its rights and dignity, would have offered a determined resistance to such a demand. The incident has, moreover, been provisionally settled, and is not likely to occur again. As regards a permanent arrangement, I might perhaps come to an agreement with the Persian authorities that the procedure followed in Turkey and Egypt in connection with the delivery of mails to the foreign post-offices established in Ottoman territory should be adopted as regards ours in the Persian Gulf. If your Lordship approves of this suggestion, I would venture to ask that the Postmaster at Constanti nople should be instructed to furnish me with particulars on the subject. Mr. Grant Duff asks me to inform your Lordship, in relation to this corre spondence, that he has nothing to add to his despatch No. 223 of the 9th December, 1904, except that the statements made by M. Lavers in regard to his language at their interview are inaccurate. It is true that Mr. Grant Duff characterized the action of the British Postal authorities at Bushire as “ extraordinaire,” but he added “si le rapport du Directeur de la Douane est exact,” or words to that effect. He also said that immediately he received the views of the Government of India he would do his best to settle the difficulty in a manner satisfactory to both parties. It is, Mr. Grant Duff submits, obviously impossible that he undertook to abolish on his own authority a system which has been in force for about forty years. M.

Tehran, December 0, 1904. ti-an.m, to onr ! orHrh™ 7 S '' am ^ 0 ' U7 ° f the 3rd December, I have the honour to tiansmit to your Lordship correspondence regarding the difficulty which has arisen Busffire' Department of Customs and Posts and the British post-office at As the question till recently chiefly concerned the Government of India. I have not previously reported directly to your Lordship on the subject On the day of the receipt of M. Lavers’ note of the 20th October, I at once th&lt; r D° v erament of India the particulars of the complaint made bv the Persian Ministry of Customs, and addressed a note to him requesting that the arran«e- ments m force at Bushire as regards the British post-office should be left m state quo pending a definite settlement of the question between the British and Persian Govern ments. On the 24 th November 1 received a further communication from M. Lavers to the effect that he had sent orders to the Director of Customs at Bushire that the British mails were, when landed, to be taken direct to the custom-house, and there examined in the presence of an official of the British post-office. The parcels would then lie delivered by the Customs officials after paying duty. On the same day ( 24 th November) I saw M. Lavers, and said that while the question of our post-offices in Persia was under discussion I must protest against anv interference with the British mails on the part ol the Persian Government. I told him that I was awaiting a communication from the Government of India on the subject, and that when I had received their views I would do my best to arrange the matter‘in a wav satisfactory to both Governments. I naturally imagined that after my conversation with M. Lavers he would have had the courtesy to await a further communication from me expressing the views of the Government of India. On the 2nd instant the Director of Customs at Bushire seized the British mails. I at once, alter informing ±VJ. Lavers of the fact, communicated with the Grand Vizier, and insisted on the immediate return of the British mails. The Grand Vizier, whom I was unable to see that day, sent me a message assuring me that the mails would be given back to the British post-office. Next day 1 saw his Highness the Mushir-ed-Dowleh and M. Lavers. I found that no orders had as yet been given, and the Grand Vizier seemed at first inclined to assert his right to seize the British mails on the ground that His Majesty’s Government had agreed to the ‘'Beglement Douanier. ’ I made it quite clear to his Highness that, even supposing the Persian Government were in their right in asserting that parcels were delivered by the British post-office to persons who were not exempted from payment of customs dues, the question of these offices was under discussion between the Persian and His Majesty’s Governments, and it was intolerable that the Belgian officials should adopt this method of settling the matter. 1 stated that I had given instructions to His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General at Bushire to prevent by force any further tampering with the British mails, and that, should any untoward incident occur, the entire responsibility would rest with the Persian Government. The British post-offices had been some forty years in the Persian Gulf with the knowledge and assent of the Persian Government, and they could not be swept away in one day by order of M. Lavers. Finally, his Highness agreed to telegraph to Bushire instructing the Director of Customs that the British mails which had been seized were to be returned, but that, pending the settlement of the question, a Belgian Customs official would be present at the opening of the post bags, and levy duty on parcels addressed to persons not exempted from the payment of customs duties. 1 trust your Lordship will approve my action in the matter. There have, as your Lordship is aware, been several unpleasant incidents in Persia since 1 have been in charge, and the Persian Government have shown their usual dilatoriness in taking effectual steps [2280 cc— 6 ] , B VI6 This attitude is, under Articles 27 and 51 of the “ Reglement Douanier, held to be illegal. I am informed by the Secretary-General that post-bags addressed to British officers in the ports of the south must in future he taken straight to the custom-house, and there, in presence of the Customs officials, may be opened by^ the British post-office officials, and the former will retain an\ parcels or letters upon which duty is leviable. A receipt will be given for these parcels, and the addressees will then be asked to take delivery of them. In the case of outgoing bags the same formalities will be observed. Though the immunities of the Diplomatic and Consular Services will be observed, the quarantine doctors and British post-office officials cannot claim the right to be exempt of duty. It is further complained that parcels are received by certain merchants straight from the British post-office, and these will have to repay the customs duties. 1 should like to have your views respecting the above, and please inform me what agreement was come to with the Persian Government in the first instance, if any, vrith respect to our post-offices. 1 have told the Secretary-General that I have referred the matter to the Government of India, and that pending the expression of your views, the actual system in force should not be altered. • It seems to me likely that the present interference with our post-offices will, on M. Nous’ return, be followed by an attack on our quarantine. The present Grand Vizier’s policy is to curtail all foreign influence in his country, and I find that he becomes more obstructive every day. i think the Persian Government fears we mean to bully them while the attention of Russia is engaged in the Far East. Inclosure 8 in No. 1. Acting Resident, Bushire, to Mr. Grant Duff. {No. 99 .) (Telegraphic.) P. Bushire, October 30 - 31 , 1904 . 1 HAVE received your telegram respecting the British post-office question, dated the 21 st instant, No. 93 . Our post-offices in the Gulf, according to my records [have enjoyed the ?] tacit approval of the Persian Government. I cannot, however, find any trace of a formal agreement on the subject, though for over forty years, when no proper Persian post-office had yet been started, we have carried letters and parcels for British and Persian subjects to the advantage of the latter. No part of the subsidy to the mail-steamers is paid by the Persian Government as far as I know. The Belgian Customs Administration raised this question of parcels soon after they com menced work, and in June 1900 an Agreement was concluded on the subject between the Residency and the Director-General, and a copy of the same was inclosed in my letter of the 8th December, 1902 , No. 167 . It was on this occasion that the Central Customs Administration endeavoured first to alter the arrangement. The Agreement stipulated by Article 8 that our post-office should deliver direct all parcels for the Residency or officers of superior service—that is to say, non-menials—or parcels addressed to officers of the British or Indian navy. The British postmaster opens the parcel-bags in accordance with the present arrangement in our post-office in the presence of Customs officials, and those parcels exempted by Article 8 are kept by us, and the remainder go back to the custom-house for examination. Article 8 has several times been questioned by the Customs Department, but M. Waffelaert finally agreed to let it remain as it stood on the last occasion he referred to it. The Resident receives a weekly statement, showing the contents, value, and recipient of all parcels which are not sent to the Customs. The Director of Customs receives a monthly statement in order to be able to check to same, and for statistical purposes. The Director of Customs was told by Major Cox that this concession was of great value, as in consequence of it much formality and delay, though it would then become necessary, was avoided. Major Cox observed at the same time that the monthly statement was an efficient check. If, on the other hand, foreign Consuls objected, as the Director had stated, the history of our work in the Gulf for the last; century and a-half entitled us to small concessions of this nature. M. Waflelaert expressed himself satisfied, but has nevertheless apparently complained. The broad statement that [group undecypherable] are in the habit of receiving parcels seems absurd. AIf a complaint of any particular instance had been adduced the postmaster would he punished [gioup undecypherablej, and if a subject amenable to our jurisdiction, he would receive seveie treatment, but the Residency has received no such complaint. The officials of the post-office are regarded as officials of the Residency, anl the reason of this is that the post-office was in the hands of our own clerks until the work increased, and it was necessary on account of departmental details to have officials of the Postal Department from India. The postmaster is even now under the Resident, and cannot hold communication with local officials. The Postal Department deals with questions of pay and allowances, &amp;c., through the Resident. The quarantine doctor is the Residency surgeon s assistant, and our hospital is in his bands. He is, therefore, a Residency official, and his quarantine work is done in addition to his own particular work. The total value of paicels not sent to the Customs, according to the last return for three months, shows that their value was 1,918 rupees, and of this the parcels received by officers exempted by the c&lt; Reglement ” were valued at 1.551 rupees, and the parcels received by Residency subordinates at 367 rupees, and the amount of revenue in question is very small. I think it would be undesirable to alter the present system, or to curtail the small privileges at present extended to us in consequence of our long and useful work in the Persian Gulf, and the Resident has expressed himself to the same effect. I have repeated the above to the Indian Government. Inclosure 9 in No. 1. Acting Resident, Bushire, to Mr. Grant Duff. (No. 109.) (Telegraphic.) P. November 23-21, 1904. WITH reference to your telegram No. 93, dated the 21st October, respecting the British post-office question, I have to-day received a letter from the Customs Department requesting me to inaugurate new r arrangements with respect to the parcels post starting with the post due to-morrowu In reply I have said that, the question being under discussion, I requested that the change might be postponed pending a settlement of the question by you and the Government of India.

WITH respect to my telegram No. 109 of 23rd November, concerning the British Indian post-offices. When the usual guard of one non-commissioned officer and three men proceeded yesterday to the custom-house to accompany our mail to our post-office they were prevented from leaving the premises by the Customs authorities. I consequently proceeded to the custom-house and explained distinctly to the Director-General that I was not in a position to alter the existing arrangements without instructions, which up till * Also to Kesident, Bushire (No. 108).8 then I had not received. Under the circumstances I proposed to act as usual. If, however, the Director-General desired to change procedure, he would have to take upon himself the responsibility for retaining His Majesty’s mails. In reply, the Director- General showed me bis orders, stating that the responsibility lay with the Ministry of from entering the custom-house inclosure, and that the bags were not to leave, and one man who was bearing a parcel bag was at the gate stopped. The sea being too rough to reship the mails or to leave them on the quay under a guard, I directed, in order to prevent a disturbance, that the escort should not resist when the parcel post was about to be seized by the Customs officials. They locked up ten cases and six bags, and, pending instructions, I did not consent to allow our postal official to go and open the ba°-s 0 . Responsibility is assumed by the custom-house lor the bags; letter bags, after three hours, were removed. The British mail-steamer was delayed twelve hours, as it did not get the usual receipt, and consequently missed the tide it counted upon. I respectfully protest against the behaviour of the custom-house, who did not, as it should, wait for the expression of the Government of India’s views, and I trust steps will be taken by you with a view to the handing over of our parcel post to our post-office bv the Belgian official responsible for retaining the same. This should be done without delay, and an undertaking shomd, I think, be made not to interfere with our postal service until the matter is arranged. The above has been repeated to the Government of India. Customs, that he must obey, and the mails must be prevented from leaving the custom house. The mail clerk to whom I gave the usual order to proceed was about to do so, but the Director-General prevented the mails leaving by force, and the gates were closed.

From—Captain A. P. Trevor, Assistant to the Political Resident ia the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have sent the following telegram to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran :— Begins—VXezsQ see your telegram No. 173, dated October *21st. British post office. Border record shows the number of British post offices in the Persian Gulf which have tacit approval of Persian Government, but no formal agreement appears to have been made. For more than forty years letters and par cels have been carried for British and Persian subjects to the benefit of the latter when no proper Persian post office was maintained. No portion of subsidy for mail steamers is borne by the Persian Government so far as I am aware. When the B-hrian Customs administration was first started, the question of parcels was raised, and in June L900 an agreement was arrived at between the Resident and Director General of Customs, a copy of which was forwarded to you with my letter No. 167, dated the 8th December 1902, when the Central Customs Department first tried to upset the arrangement. Article 8 of the Agreement provides that parcels for the Resident and all officers of superior service and for officers of His Majesty’s ships should be delivered direct from the pest office. The present arrangement is that parcels bags are opened in our post office by the British postmaster in the presence of the Customs official, parcels for persons exempted by Article 8 being retained and all others sent hack to the Custom-house for examination. This article has been questioned several times by the Customs officials, the last time in July by Monsieur Waffelaert, who finally agreed to let it stand. A weekly return is submitted to the Resident showing the names of recipients, value, and contents of parcels not sent to the Custom-house, and a return is forwarded monthly to the Director-General of Customs for check and statistical purposes. Major Cox pointed out to Monsieur Waffelaert that the concession was much prized, as it obviated necessary delays and formalities in the Custom-house, that the return was an efficient check, and that if foreign Consulates objected, as Monsieur Waffelaert alleged, our occupa tion’in the Gulf for the last one hundred and fifty years should entitle us to enjoy small concessions of this sort. Monsieur Waffelaert expressed himself entirelv satisfied, but has, in spite of this, apparently made a complaint. The general allegation by the Customs officials about merchants receiving parcels seems futile. If a special complaint had been made and proved, the postmaster would have been punished and the merchants, if they were British subiects, would have been severely dealt with. No such complaint has been made to Resident. Post office officials are regarded as Residency officials, because the post office was managed by the Residency clerks for yea.s until the work increased, and it became necessary for departmental details to be dealt with by the officials of the Postal Department. Even now the postmaster is under the Resident and camiot communicate with local officials. Questions of pay, local S oluLs are dealt with by the Postal Department through the Residency ’ The quarantine doctor is Assistant to the Residency Surgeon who Sin charge of oui? hospital and as such entitled to be treated as a Residency official In addition to his own duties, he only does quarantine work.

I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Mr. Erskine’s despatch No. 60, dated the 10th November, on the subject of the new parcel post regulations. On the 30th October last the Director of Customs addressed a letter to the British Postmaster in Bushire, informing him that, in accordance with orders received by telegram from Tehran, all the mail hags enclosing parcels were henceforward to be delivered to the Custom-house immediately after they had been landed, and were not to be taken to the post office in accordance with the hitherto*existing custom. As the Bri ish postmaster has no authority to comply with the orders of the Customs Department without referring to me, he forwarded the letter to me for my instructions. On the 3rd November the Director of Customs again addressed the post master in somewhat peremptory terms informing him that the parcel mail bags were to be taken to the Custom-house, and that, if these orders were not carried out, the postmaster would be responsible for the consequences. I accordingly addressed my telegram No. 34, dated the 5th November, to Mr. Erskine, and I wrote to the Director of Customs informing him that the matter had been referred to Tehran and asking him meanwhile to allow matters to remain in statu quo. On the receipt of Mr. Erskine’s telegram No. 62, dated the 10th November, for which I beg to express my obligations, I again ad dressed the Director of Customs, and I have the honour to submit herewith a •Notsent. copy of this letter No. 894,* dated the t Not sent. 13th November, and also a copy of the Director’s reply No. 1912,f dated the 18th November, from which it would appear that the matter will have to be decided between the Customs Adminis tration and the British Legation in Tehran. In June 1900 the question of the disposal of parcels received in the British post office came into prominence, and after discussion with the late Monsieur Simais, then Director of Customs in Bushire, a set of rules was framed for the guidance of the postmaster. I have the honour to submit a copy of these rules for Your Excellency s information. Monsieur Simais expressed his perfect satisfaction with the instructions issued to the postmaster, and I had no reason to suppose that the present Customs authorities had any fault to find with the system then inaugurated. It was only on receipt of Mr. Eiskine’s telegram that I learned that a complaint had been* made that the post office refused to show the original letters of advice. So far as this complaint goes, I can only say that no such request had ever been preferred, and, if it had been, I would of course have taken immediate steps to remove the cause of complaint The postmaster assures me that he has always adhered to the instructions which were issued to him, and I cannot believe the statement contained in Monsieur Pnem s reply to Mr. Erskine that the post office officials have always refused to exhibit ito the Custom-house officials the original letters of advice. As I explained in my telegram No. 36, dated the 15th November, the postmaster does not receive letters of advice. He only receives lists from the offices of posting, and these lists cannot be sent by him to the Customs, as he only receives one copy. These are, however, of course open to the inspection of the official from tue Custom-house who comes to the post office to take delivery of the parcels, and I have instructed the postmaster accordingly. ^ h arc ^ s P re P are d by the postmaster in accordance with snffi,W h f 2 ti d 3 0t “emorandum of instructions is not considered clr fi P^P/f es . of tlle Custom-house and if the Customs authorities are not satisfied with the inspection by their official of the original lists of wiH be neceidv / he onl ^ form of advice furnished to the postmaster, then it prepared in the ^ other arran gement whereby duplicate lists are the other to the fiestn ^ A‘ P° stl “^. one c °py bfcing sent to the postmaster and tdamnL 1 and T C de P rocedure ’ however, will take some time to me shoffid ltkfV dll t?f 0n Wh - J the existin » arrangements, which it seems not be allowed to remain in forT^^ 43 ° f ^ Custom3 ^P^tment, shouldI do not think thnt we are bound to admit the right of the Customs Department to claim that parcels received in the British post office should he taken direct to the Custom-house before they are taken to the post office. The British post offices have been established in the Gulf for many years, and the fact of these post offices existing in Persia would seem to imply that they have certain ex-territorial rights pertaining to them. I do not think, therefore, that the statement made in the seeond paragraph of the Director’s letter I\o. 1912, dated the 15th November 1902, to my address should be accepted as correct. I do not know if Monsieur Priem’s statement that in England and in all other countries in Europe postal parcels are taken at once to the Custom house, is accurate. I believe that this is not the case as regards the British post offices in Turkey ; but at any rate, so far as Persia is concerned, I should deprecate, both as a matter of principle and of our own departmental convenience, the measures which the Customs Administration now desires to introduce. Memorandum of instructions to postmaster regarding parcels. (1) As soon after the arrival of the mails as possible, the postmaster will open the parcel bags and check their contents with the lists received by him from the office of posting. (2) He will then prepare a list showing all the parcels received by him either belonging to British subjects or natives or foreigners with the exception of those enumerated below. (3) The list should contain the following particulars:— (I) Number of parcels. (II) Names of addressees. (III) Name of the steamer by which received. (IV) Date of receipt. (V) Particulars of contents (if possible). (VI) Value of parcels (if given by sender). (VII) Whether paid or unpaid (i.e., whether any money is due to post office or not). (4) After preparing the list, the postmaster will send it in a sealed cover to the Director of Customs, Bushire. (5) After receipt by him of the aforesaid list, the Director of Customs will send an official to the post office to take charge of the parcels noted in the list. (6) The postmaster will make over to the officer sent by the Director the parcels against his receipt. (7) As the Director of Customs will not deliver up parcels to the addres sees without production of a delivery order from the postmaster, the addressees should apply to the postmaster for delivery orders and pay whatever money may be due to the Postal Department. (8) The parcels belonging to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, his Assistants, the Residency Surgeon, and the Residency establishment (officers of superior service), also that belonging to Her Majesty s and Royal Indian Marine ships, should he omitted from the list and delivered direct to the addressees. (9) The above rules apply to parcels received from foreign countries. As regards those parcels which are sent out to foreign countries, the postmaster should not accept parcels not tendered by the officers and ships noted in paragraph (8) above, unless the senders produce to him a pass from the Director of Customs, Bushire, or unless he is satisfied from the description of the contents of the parcels that they are not dutiable. (10) In case of doubt as to the course he should pursue in a certain case, the postmaster should always apply for instructions to the Resident or one of his Assistants.Telegram, dated the 23rd (received 24th) November 190 k From— Captain A.

The Customs Department have again complained that parcels for Consular officers which arrive by British post are not declared, and they have furnished me with a list of the persons who received such parcels during the month of October. Many persons shown on the list would appear to have no right to exemption. I should be glad to know how we can defend such action as we have accepted the Beglement.

With reference to Mr. Grant-Duff’s telegram of 24th Nov ember on the subject, I beg to recommend that the Postal Department should issue orders that all parcels addressed to Indian post offices in Persian territory must bear a declaration of the contents for the information of Customs Depart ment. This would facilitate matters and could presumably be arranged with out altering the present rate of postage. Parcels now go as inland parcels within declaration from Indian to Persian territory ports. Telegram F., dated the 2 nd (received 3rd) December 1904. From— Captain A. P. Tr*vor, Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. Please refer to my telegram No. 109, dated the 23rd November, on the subject of British Indian post office. Yesterday when the usual guard of one non-commissioned officer and three men proceeded to the Custom-house to escort our mail to the British Indian post office, the Customs officials prevented them from leaving the premises. On this I went to the Custom-house and clearly explained to the Director-General that I was not empowered to change the existing arrangements without instructions, that I had received none, that under the circumstances I proposed to carry out the usual procedure, and that, if he wished to change the procedure, he must take the responsibility for stop ping His Majesty’s mail. The Director-General replied by showing his orders and saying that the Ministry of Customs was responsible, and that he must obey and prevent the mail leaving the Custom-house. On my telling the mail clerk to proceed as usual, the Director-General prevented the mail leaving by force. He had the gate closed and repeated his orders to the sentry to prevent porters from entering and the bags fromleaving the Customs enclosure. One man carrying the parcel bag was stopped at the gate. As it was too rough to re-ship the mail or to leave it on the quay under guard (and) in order to prevent disturbance when the Customs officials began to seize the parcel post, I directed the escort not to resist. Ten cases and six bags were seized and locked up. I refused, pending instructions, to send a British Indian postal official to open the bags. The Customs assumed re sponsibility for the safe custody of the bags. After about three hours, letter bags were then removed, and, owing to her not getting a receipt for the mail and missing the tide, the mail steamer was delayed twelve hours. I beg to prospect against the action of the Customs authorities, who have not waited for the views of the Government of India, and I venture to hope that you will take steps to get the Minister of Customs to order a responsible official to hand over the parcel post to the British Indian post office without delay and, until the question is properly settled, to undertake not to interfere again.

The Persian Government have been informed by me that if there is delay I shall be compelled to take strong measures to obtain redress for the unwar ranted action of the Director Post. I am informing the Mushir-ed-dowleh that I have instructed you to resist by force any further tampering with the British mails until the question is properly settled between the Persian Government and the British Legation.

I was present at the meeting which took place today consisting of the Grand Vizier, Mushir-ed- Dowleh, and the Director of Customs. The complaint of the Persian Govern ment is that parcels arriving by post at Busbire are not declared at the Custom house, which is contrary to Reglement Douanier, and consequently pay no duty. As we have [no] lieglement, I A g r(ed t0 - think it is difficult to defend the above practice and, pending the receipt of instructions, I have arranged that parcels which are received at the British post office shall be opened in the presence of a Customs officer, who shall take a list of addresses and levy duty on goods of non-exempted persons. The Russians threaten to claim equal privilege unless parcels by British post are declared. 1 have sent Bushire necessary instructions on the subject.

Monsieur Waffelaert, however, on his return from tour immediately took up the matter, and wrote to me on the morning of the 1st December saying that he had received detailed instructions from the Ministry of Customs, and that Monsieur Lavers stated that the British Legation had promised to send urgent orders to me to introduce immediately the system as detailed in his letter. 6. I attach a copy of Monsieur Waffelaert’s letter, from which you will see __ w . VT * . . . that the new system as understood by the M. Warner s letter N o. 830 also enclosed. ^ j. • i • Customs Department involves an exami nation of the letters bv the Customs as well as the parcels, and also the opening of the entire mails at the Cusrom House and delivery of parcels through the agency of the Persian Post Olfice. 6. I can not express too strongly my view of the undesirability of such a plan. As long as we maintain British Post Offices in the Gulf the mails should, in my opinion, be opened at the Post Offices and nowhere else. This is the rule at the Post Offices in Basrah and Bagdad. 7. I replied to Monsieur Waffelaert the same day saying that no instruc tions had been received by me to introduce any new system with the mails, and that therefore I could not do so. 8. Monsieur Waffelaert then wrote suggesting that I should introduce the new system under protest. I replied immediately saying that as I had no in structions I could not alter a system which had been in force for years, and that I proposed to send down the usual escort to bring up the mail, and I trusted that in the circumstances Monsieur Waffelaert would not obstruct. 9. On the afternoon of the 1st December, and which was a very wet and windy day, I sent the usual escort of one non-commissioned officer and three men to the Customs to bring up the mail.After some time I received intimation that they had been stopped and detained. I then went and saw Monsieur Waffelaert and explained to him personally my inability to alter the present procedure without instructions. I added that I had received none and proposed to carry out the old system unless Monsieur Waffelaert cared to prevent my doing so by force. 10. Monsieur Waffelaert showed me his instructions from Monsieur Lavers. The telegram began with the words : “ The British Legation has promised me to send urgent orders to Bushire to introduce immediately the new Postal arragements, etc,” or words to this effect and continued by giving the new arrangements in detail. Monsieur Waffelaert no doubt thought that when I said 1 had received no instructions, I was not stating the truth and said he had no option but to carry out his orders. 11. I then went down and told the mail clerk to proceed as usual. I think that I could have easily marched off the guard with the mails if it had not been for the lack of hamals, all of whom had been excluded from the Custom premises. There were about 40 bags, some of which were heavy and hamals were absolutely necessary. As it was, the mail clerk got a causal bystander to take up a parcel mail bag, but the man was stopped at the gate. The Director General had the gates closed and extra sentries posted and one M r. Lucas an Armenian, the “ Hamal Bashi” was very much in evidence ordering everyone about and behaving in a very insolent way. 12. As the day was very windy and wet and a dhow had just gone down coming from the ship, I decided not to send the mail back to the ship or leave it on the quay in charge of the guard as the contents of the bags would be damaged in any case. When the Customs b^gan to seize the parcefmails, there fore 1 told the guard not to resist. Ten cases and six bags were seized and locked up. IS. Under the existing system the mail officer of the steamer takes the receipt of the British Postmaster, and I had to give the steamer Agents an indem nity against loss, and owing to the three hours delay at the Customs House and to formalities connected with the receipts for the mails the Boyal Mail Steamer Kasara was delayed and misssed the tide. She was consequentlv delaved more than 12 hours. W^hen I have ascertained from the British India Steam Navigation Company what amount of demurrage is due, I propose to put in a claim against the Customs Department for the amount, which 1 trust you will support. 14. I also be? to suggest that the Customs should pay some compensation for the detention of the parcels mails for six days, and that Monsieur Layers ard Monsieur Waifelaert should each make an apology in the presence of a renre- sentative of the Persian Goyernment for their unwarrantable action in detaining iiis Majesty s mails. 111 &amp; 15. I have already reported telegraphically (my telegram No lift ,ui„,i 8th instant) that the mail was handed over at the British Post Office bv Jl’onsieur Wagner and Mr. Lucas (Hamal Bashi) on the morning of the 8th of December 16 In addition to the stoppage of the English mails I beg to mention that the local mails arriving on the 4th and 5th of December were detained im«i an official of the Customs had seen that there were no parcels. d ’ ,, 1 17 - In a ccord ance with the usual custom as specie is generally received in the local mails a guard of one non-commissioned officer and two men went M the Customs to fetch the mails to Post Office on the 4th of December ™ * ,, , 1 ^; T1 f Havaldar (Indian Sergeant), in charge of the party, reported to me that when he went down to the Customs with the escort, the Hama? Bashi Mr Lucas, detained him and tried to take possession of the mails. The Havaldar refused to deliver them over and sent one of his men to me. Mr. Lucas then abused the Havaldar m Persian, which he did not understand, called him a ^ ^ an d made use of several other opprobrious epithets. ^ SeG n ° rea 1 son to the Havaldar’s statement, supported as it i&lt;s Bv that of the sepoy who was posted as a sentry on the mail ba- though dnn£ 7 less Mr. Lucas would deny the whole incident. 0 ’ ° Ugh doubt “3133 F. D. Exd.— L. G, G. 20. There can be no doubt that Mr. Lucas obstructed the mail escort, and in any case I.do not understand what Mr. Lucas, who is supposed to be simply an agent for landing and delivering cargo, had to do with the matter at all, and his interference with an escort of His Majesty’s Indian Army seems to be Quite uncalled for, and in my opinion deserves punishment. # submit that the ^ action of the Customs Department throughout this affair shows that they consider themselves at liberty to do anything they like, and do not think that they are responsible for their actions to the Persian Government or anyone else, and I trust that strong action may be taken to induce them to see the error of their views. 22. Prom your telegram No. 114 I understand that a temporary arrange ment has been arrived at, and I trust that no alteration will be made until the Government of India and the Pesident have had an opportunity of dis cussing the new system. I notice that the instructions telegraphed to Monsieur Waffelaert differ a good deal from those conveyed in your telegram No. 114, but I have suggested to Monsieur Waffalaert that as a temporary arrangement all parcels except those for officers exempted by the Reglement should go to the Customs House and that parcels for such officers should be inspected by Monsieur Wagner, whom Monsieur Waffelaert has deputed to be present at the opening of the mail bags at the British Post Office.

In reply to your letter No. 1461 of the 28th ultimo, I have the honour to inform you that the telegraphic instructions received from my Head Office inform me that His Britannic Majesty’s Legation had promised to send urgent instructions to the Consulate General here, and order the immediate enforce ment of the new postal arrangements communicated to you in my letter No. 830, dated 23rd ultimo. 1 beg to request, therefore, that you will he good enough to issue orders for the mail bags due to arrive to-day being delivered to my Department. No. 880, dated 23rd November 1904. From— Monsieur A. Wagner,/ br Director General of Customs, To— Captain A. P. Trevor, I.A., First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to bring to your notice that I have received telegraphic instructions intimating that according to the last paragraph of Article 27 of the Eeglement Legal all postal bags addressed to the Indian Post Office of this town must be handed directly into the Custom House from the mail steamer. After careful and due examination of the postal packages by the Persian Customs and Post, in the presence of an employe deputed by the Indian Post Office, only the bags containing correspondence will be made over to the Indian Post Office, while all parcels and samples and all bags containing such will be kept back in the Customs House, which will pass through the Persian Post Office a receipted list of such bags to the Indian Post Office. The same rule only in a contrary sense is to be applied to mail bags sent out by the Indian Post office. In view of the above I request that you will be good enough to give the needful instruction to the Indian Postmaster with a view to causing him to comply with the stipulation of the article of the Beglement referred to above and to give effect to it for the next arriving mail. I beg further to solicit the favour of your causing instructions to the same effect to be issued for your Lingah and Bunder Abbas Offices, l IFrom Viceroy to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, Wth December 1904. {Repeated to Secretary of State.) P .—Postal affairs in Persian Gulf Your telegram of 3rd instant. We would adopt, as regards parcels, arrangement such as is indicated in Memorandum of June 1900 {see Trevor's telegram of 30th October last, No. 99) with proviso that Customs declaration should accompany all parcels, and that invoice of parcels prepared by Indian office of exchange should, together with Customs declaration, be enclosed in separate cover addressed to Persian Customs House officials, to whom it should be delivered as soon as the parcels bag is landed. An arrangement of a similar nature has been in force at Constantinople for many years, and was extended in 1891 to Basrah and Bagdad. As regards letter mails, we entertain strong objection to Customs examination. At Basrah and Bagdad no such examination occurs, nor does there seem to be any reason to suspect that letter post is used as a means of evading Customs dues. With reference to your telegram of^th November, we have desired Trevor by telegraph to report on question of unauthorised immunity from Customs dues. If this practice is found to exist, we are prepared to repress it vigorously. If further attempt is likely to be made under colour of Articles 27 and 51 of Reglement Douanier to undermine our special position in postal matters, ground for a demand for the prompt recognition of it is furnished by the high-handed action reported in Trevor's telegram of the 2nd instant./) Departments are requested, if they suspect that there is Jny mistake in this tel earn m in^iatelj- mith the Private Secretary to the Parliamentary Under Secretary 0/Stlr'^ . 15 DEC 1904 t «/l i ff- /Vi COPY OF TELEGRAM FROM tc Dated . / Lp .. c Y /‘fULf^ PtECEIYED AT LONDON OFFICE O / From Viceroy to Sis Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, \Uh December 1904. ^IL '' . {Repeated to Secretary of State.)
