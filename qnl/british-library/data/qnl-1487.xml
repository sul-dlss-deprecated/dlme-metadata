No. 1693 , dated Bushire, the 4 th (received 15 th) June 1914 . From Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. I have the honour to state that, just before mv recent visit to Bahrain, Major Trevor reported that, at his farewell visit to Shaikh Isa on the 15th May, he was greatly surprised to learn from the Shaikh that the latter was dissatisfied with the receipts from the Customs House and was thinking of putting an Arab in charge. 2. 1 have now the honour to enclose copies of the correspondence that passed between the Political Agent and Shaikh Isa on the subject, which will, I trust, explain itself. 3. When I reached Bahrain, Major Trevor informed me that the danger had passed and that Shaikh Isa had summoned the present Director of Customs and had informed him that he had full confidence in him and his management and had no present intention of making any change. On Shaikh Isa’s visit to me, I expressed my gratification at learning that a change which had, to my knowledge, excited the greatest consternation among the leading merchants at Bahrain was no longer contemplated. 4. There has been voluminous correspondence in the past on the subject of the Bahrain Customs and the question of their management by trained Customs officials lent to the Shaikh on the recommendation of the Government of India, has been frequently mooted but Shaikh Isa’s opposition has always proved unsurmountable, I have carefully examined this correspondence and find that prior to 1904 this Residency attempted to establish the principle that the Shaikh of Bahrain was bound by promises, given on more than one occasion, not to renew the contracts for farming out his Customs to Hindu bunniahs without previously consulting the Resident. Shaikh Isa almost as consistently denied the existence of any such promises and affirmed his complete liberty of action in the matter. The trend of later correspondence up to 1908 runs more in the direction of non-interference with Shaikh Isa in the matter of his Customs management. The bunniahs have ceased to farm the Customs and now occupy the position of Shaikh Isa's own servants, render accounts to him and pay him on an average some 3J lakhs of rupees per annum on this account. Since 1908, owing to the supposed good management of the Customs and the improved system, vis., service rather than farming, the matter appears to have remained quiescent and attention has been devoted to the wretched landing and distribution arrange ments rather than to the actual Customs Service. I may remark parenthetically that the recent flutter in the dovecot was apparently due to Shaikh Isa’s cupidity having been excited by an offer made by two Arabs, Abdullah Qassaibi and Ahmad Sulaiman, tt&gt; pay Shaikh Isa sk lakhs of rupees per annum. The present Director of Customs has convinced Major Trevor that it is, in present circumstances, impossible to realise such a sum from the Bahrain Customs. It may be added that the two Arab tenderers are, I am informed by Major Trevor, in a very shaky position financially and that there is reason to believe that this offer was merely a wild attempt to restore their finances at the expense of the public, and probably the event would have shown, at that of Shaikh Isa. 5. Premising that the Government of India have no wish to undertake the responsibility of lending Customs officials to Shaikh Isa, provided that there is any chance of establishing satisfactory Customs management in any other way, I have the honour to suggest for their consideration a method that, at the present juncture, seems to offer some prospect in my opinion of successful but.7 i^i 2 'ism unobtrusive interference with a view to improved Customs management at no great cost to Government, certainly not out of proportion to the advantages that 1 hope may thereby be obtained for trade in general and British trade and Shaikh Isa in particular. It seems to me important that the Political Agent should endeavour to establish closer relations with the present Customs Director, who appears to be progressive and amenable to the Political Agent’s advice and influence The Polft cal Agent is however, very fully occupied and his staff are exceedingly hardworked. It ’is not to be expected and would indeed as arousing suspicion be undesirable for him to show a continual interest in the details^ of Customs management and his staff, as at present constituted, have not the leisure to do so on his behalf. This difficulty could, I believe, be surmounted by the a PP? ,nt ' ment of a special “ commercial ” clerk preferably an English knowing Hindu whose duties would be confined to noting exclusively on trade and Customs management at Bahrain, with special relation to the financial position between Shaikh Isa and his Hindu Customs department. It will, no doubt, be obvious from the above that the Hindu clerk to be appointed should be a persona Praia to the present Customs Superintendent, who might well be consulted in regard to the appointment. 1 hope, in this way, to keep the Political Agent in close touch with the Customs management and enable him to introduce reforms without appearing himself, and to increase our knowledge generally on Bahrain commercial matters and on what is going on at the Customs House. The fright to which the Customs Superintendent has lately been exposed and the success with which Major Trevor’s influence was exerted on his behalf should render him more than ever amenable to the Political Agents advice and influence. 6. Should the Government of India be disposed to entertain the idea favourably, I will direct the Political Agent, Bahrain, to submit concrete proposals. Before submitting this draft, I have consulted Major Trevor, the late Political Agent, Bahrain, and Captain Keyes, the new incumbent, who both welcome the proposal. c Enclosure No. i. Translation of a letter No. 542, dated 16th May 1914, from Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrain, to Shaikh Isa bin All Al Khali/ah, Chief of Bahrain, When I called yesterday to take leave of you, you mentioned that you were thinking of appointing some Arab to the charge of Customs, and I very strongly recommended you not to do anything in haste but to give the present manage ment warning that you are not satisfied with the work done and direct them to keep regular accounts, etc. I added that if eventually any change is to be made in the charge of the Customs it should only be given to experienced persons and that if you required experienced persons I could, no doubt, assist you to get some. I trust that on thinking the matter over as you promised to do you have decided to act on my advice. If so the‘rest of this letter may be disregarded. On my return to Manama yesterday I was exceedingly surprised to hear a very circumstantial report that a contract for the Customs was to be given to Abdullah Qassaibi and Ahmad Salman for 6 lakhs a year, I think this is probably incorrect in view of what you said, possibly this report has been spread by the interested parties. Should there be any truth in it, however, I must take very strong exception to the appointment of these two individuals as farmers. First, because the alleged proposed arrangement is a farm of the Customs and you have on previous occasions told various Residents that you would not farm the Customs. Secondly, because the two individuals concerned are totally inexperienced in Customs work, and further as you are aware objections have been made against them individually by my predecessors for various reasons.I understand that both Captain Mackenzie and Major Knox spoke to you about them, and I expect you will remember this. Thirdly, one of the gentlemen mentioned in the reports is I have reason to believe in a bad way financially. He has borrowed large sums of money from British subjects and recently mortgaged a good deal of property. As regards Ahmad bin Salman he is well known as one of the partners in a most unsuccessful attempt to work as landing contractor. The Agency files are full of complaints against him, many of which as you know were only settled with great difficuly, and a few of which remain unsettled. I understand he left Bahrain during his contract. Such a man is obviously quite unfitted to take up Customs work. Fourthly, for the above reasons merchants will not have any reliance on these two persons and already British subjects have protested against the idea^ of their being put in charge. 1 expect that you would find that the majority of merchants of all class are against the change. The Customs and landing arrangements have gradually been regularised after years of trouble and the introduction of inexperienced Customs farmers would throw them back into the old bad conditions from the merchants’ point of view. Fifthly, the present landing arrangements which have been introduced with the approval of the High Government and which are working smoothly will be thrown into confusion, and neither of the persons supposed to be going to take over the Customs, having been previously unacceptable as landing contractors, could be accepted as Warehouse Superintendent. I have to say, therefore, that I cannot agree to the arrangement, which is said to be proposed, and I am sure that the High Government will not accept the arrangement either, and will, in fact, view it with grave disapproval. A large portion of the trade of Bahrain is done by British merchants and by far the greater portion of the cargojcomes in British steamers, and I am sure that the Government would not regard such a retrograde step, as that rumoured to be contemplated, with equanimity. I, therefore, warn you formally not to hand over the Customs on contract to the two individuals named nor to any other quite inexperienced persons. I sincerely hope that you will accept my advice and make no change in the present Customs arrangements which are running very smoothly beyond ordering a strict system of accounts, etc. But if you are determined in a change I request that you will not make one at once but wait until I have had time to refer the matter to the Resident. It is my duty to warn you that should you disregard my advice in this affair it is likely, in my opinion, to have serious results. I regret that this question should have been raised just as l am going away, and as a departing friend I urge you in your own interests to accept my advice about this matter. This is what had to be said. May you be preserved and salams. Enclosure No. 2.

After compliments— I have had the honour to receive your letter, dated 24th Jamadi II 1332 (20th May 1914) and am glad to hear that nothing has resulted regarding the proposed change in the Customs arrangements. I trust that no change of such magnitude will be made in the furture with out first consulting my successor, Captain Keyes, and giving him an opportunity of consulting the High Government if necessary. As I told you in my last letter such a change is not in my opinion one which the High Government could view with approval, and I have, therefore, thought it necessary to repeat my warning to you about the matter. This is what had to be said. May you be preserved and salams. Cs5FD-.44-.33-6.14— GCBP Simla.CONFIDENTIAL. No. 1753 , dated Bushire, the 7 th (received 15 th) June 1914 .' From— Major S G. Knox, G.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of the Govern ment of India, the translation of a letter from the Shaikh of Bahrain to Major Trevor, late Political Agent, Bahrain, replying to the last letter of the series forwarded under cover of my No. 1693, dated 4th June 1914, on the subject of a proposed change in the Customs management at Bahrain. 2 . The letter is of the usual Bahrain type. It will be noticed that it amounts to a denial of the Political Agent’s right to be consulted in important changes affecting the Customs management at Bahrain. As, however, the Government of India is, so obviously in a position, should it, in its wisdom, consider it ex pedient to do so, to impose its will in Bahrain both in this and in other matters, it seems a useless waste of time to continue the correspondence. 3. If, however, it is considered that such a challenge should not pass un noticed, I would suggest that the Political Agent may be authorised to convey to the Shaikh a message somewhat on the following lines: “ Your letter of the 25th May 1914 was forwarded by me, without comment, in the usual course of office routine, to higher authority, and I have been directed by the Resident to convey to you the following message from the Government of India in reference thereto:— ‘ The Government of India expect that the Shaikh of Bahrain will con sult their Political Agent on all important matters, especially changes, connected with the Customs management at Bahrain. They will not hesitate to interfere in such matters, should such interference appear called for in their care for the important com mercial interests, both British and Foreign, which they have in charge at that place. ’ ” Enclosure. Translation of a letter dated the 39th Jamadi Ath Thani 1332 (=z25th May 1914) from Shaikh Isa bin Ali At Khalifah, Chief of Bahrain } to Major A. P. Trevor^ C.LE. % Political Agent, Bahrain. I have received your esteemed letter No. 560, dated the 24th Jamadi Ath Thani 1332 ( = 2Qth May 1914) regarding the question of the Customs and beg to say that I do not see the suitability of again opening the discussion about this question because it ended, just as I mentioned to you in my letter dated the 24th Jamadi Ath Thani 1332 that nothing took place out of what you had heard. The real fact is that that last conversation with your honour was an unofficial talk and it had nothing to do with the official business. Had it been official I should have written to you a letter officially. I know the requirement and interest of my Government and I have also the right of changing and replacing the officials of the office of my Customs when I see necessity for that. I have confidence in the good intentions of the High Government that they would not like interference in matters specialised for my Government. I also do not ignore the points for the objections of the British Government as laid down in the agreements entered into with them. I do safeguard with the utmost care their authority and friendship. That is what was to be explained. May you be preserved and salaams. C6JFD—44—24*6 14-GCBP Simla- From Tlie Deputy Joe rotary to the Govornaent of India in tho Foreign and Political aepartaont.

I have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with your office endorsement No. 2483, dated the 21st October 1906, on the subject of the reformation of the Customs administration in Bahrein. 2. In view of the decision of the Government of India expressed in Foreign Department letter No. 3903-E.B., dated the 2nd October 1906, to your address, I have not troubled the Sheikh again on the question, but Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co. have been tentatively making bids, I understand, which naturally are not as materially advantageous to the Chief as the Government of India’s arrangement would be if the bugbear of infringement of sovereignty were satisfactorily overcome. 3. The Arab merchants, I believe, are jealous of the possibility of the firm’s being given the concession, and I have heard the views of their leader Haji Muqbil adh Dhakair, on the subject. He told me that the only fear the merchants entertained regarding the Government’s concerning itself in the administration, was that they would be harassed to a greater extent than at present by demands for cash payments and regulations of a c red tape order in general, whereas at the present time their accounts are kept in a commercial sort of way and only settled periodically. 4. I told Haji Muqbil that the Government of India only wished to benefit the trade of Bahrein and to increase the Chief’s revenue through this means, so that it was certain that any reasonable desires of the mercantile community would be considerately and carefully attended to. 5. Haji Muqbil then said that as he had a good deal of influence with the Chief just now, he having been principally instrumental in getting the Persian Haji Abdun Nabi evicted from the Cargo-Landing Management, he would sound the Chief on the question of the Customs and give him ins opinion m our favour.

B. From The SECRETAH YSEGR-E-TARY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA Major P. Z. Cox, C. I. E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Dated Simla, the 14th August igo 6 . Sir, I am directed to refer to your letter No, 74 dated the 25th Eehruary 1906, regarding the adrainistration of the Customs at Bahrein. 2. Since that letter was written, you hare recorded a later expression of your views in a Memorandum dated the 2nd July 1906. In this memorandum you have recommended tx,^. You should he authorised to address a friendly letter to Slisikh Esa, drawing his attention to the great increase in the trade of the port; pointing out how rery much less he realises than he ought to from his customs; and stating in view of this fact and in order to improve his finances, you would he prepared to advise the Government of India to maJce him an offer of three lakhs of rupees per&amp; per annum for the farra, with an adYance of one and a half lakhs to relieve him from financial difficulties. You have suggested that you should put this forward as your own idea which you cannot lay 'before the CrOYernment of India unless he gives you a preliminary assurance that he will consider the offer favourably, 3. The Government of India see no objection to the action proposed, and would be prepared, subject to the approval of His Majesty's Government, to agree to the terms suggested, provided that it is clearly understood that the Government of India can only take the farm of the entire customs and not of a mere portion thereof. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, c A Secretary to the Government of India.Confidential. No. 2041, dated Bushire, the rst (received 10 th) September 1906 . From Major P. Z. Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To Sir Louis Dane, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Foreign Department letter ^ 0 * 33^3;E.B., dated 14th August, regarding the administration of the Customs at Bahrein, and beg to attach copies of the informal letter which I addressed Cox to Sheikh Esa ’ dated Mth to Sheikh Esa on the subject and of his personally when delivering my letter. 2. The Sheikh’s reply is much what I feared it would be; a friendly but I absolute refusal to entertain my proposals. I cannot think of any further possibility in the way of friendly overture on our part, and it remains for the Government of India to decide, on the facts before them, what line they will^ now pursue. I agree with Captain Prideaux in thinking^ that if it is considered inexpedient to assume management of Sheikh Esa’s Customs before January 1908, when the present farm falls in, it would be better for us to inform the Sheikh forthwith that, with the proviso that we could not permit any lease to a foreign agency, we propose to leave him to his own shortsighted devices, and that he is therefore at liberty, if he chooses, to resell the farm to the Bania contractors ; this, in our opinion, being a preferable alternative to his attempting to manage the Customs collection by his own untrained retainers. 3. There is one point which I may briefly allude to in conclusion. As Captain Prideaux mentions in his note of 18th June, there is no doubt that Messrs. Gray Paul and Company, or for that matter Herr Wonckhaus’s firm, would be glad enough to acquire the farm if they could. Captain Prideaux deprecates this contingency on the ground that if either of the European firms obtain the lease,. Jbe believes that there would be continual effort on its part to injure the other and its clients. I am not sure that 1 agree with him in principle. Messrs. Gray Paul and Company area British firm of repute and would I think keep their competitive amenities within reasonable limits, and for the rest it becomes merely a question of our supporting a British firm and British trade against a German firm and the inroads of German trade. Anything that we can legitimately do to further our interests seems to be desirable. In the present instance, however, Sheikh Esa is the difficulty and I fear it is extremely unlikely that he would entertain an offer from Messrs. Gray Paul, at present at all events. Purport of a letter&gt; dated 14th August iqo6, from Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., to Sheikh Esa bin Ali At Khalifah, Bahrein. After compliments —I trust that you and your family have remained in the best of health during my absence in India. I write you this informal letter to let you know that since my return to Bushire I have received and studied the several annual reports of our representa tives in the different posts under this Residency both in Persia and on the Arab Prideaux 10 Major Cox, dated 24th writing, and I therefore asked Captain Prideaux to offer to explain them to him (3) Captain ] August 1906 . side, regarding the progress of trade and events in the countries in which they2 4 reside. In this connection 1 have been much gratified to find from the re Po. rt s of Captain Prideaux, your Political Agent, that the value of merchandise which has come and gone to and from your port of Bahrein has greatly increased during the past year. This is indeed very satisfactory from one point ol view • but it at the same time accentuates the regret which I feel by reason &lt; of your not personally benefiting by the improvement as you should ; and this is owing to the conditions under which you farm out your Customs in advance and draw the income before it is due. Under such conditions all the profits go to the farmers and you yourself are denied the complete benefit of your revenue. Seeing that this is the case, I am anxious to make you a friendly personal sug gestion for your consideration with a view to the improvement of your circum. stances and the replenishment of your treasury. What suggests itself to my mind is this: If you agree, when I inform my Government of the increase in the prosperity of Bahrein 1 would be prepared to suggest to them that they should make you an offer on business lines to take over the Customs Farm for three years and should pay you for it 3 00,000 rupees per annum ; and that from the date of taking them over they should make you an advance, from these 3 lakhs, of a sum of 1 2 lakhs. Then you would be able to liquidate from the amount advanced all the debts which vou at present owe and to set your mind at ease on_ that score. _ And this amount w’hich v r ould be paid to you in advance, you might conveniently pay back by instalments of 50,000 rupees per annum from the Customs revenue : and the yearly balance of 2,50,000 rupees might be paid to you at _ the rate of 20,000 rupees per month subject to deductions for expenses of administration. On the expiry of the three years aforesaid, Government and yourself might examine the accounts and decide whether the amount in future required to be enhanced or reduced, and a new figure could be fixed according to requirements. The above details are my own suggestion made to you personally in a friendly way, but I could not mention them to the Great Government vainly. I hope therefore that you will kindly send me an answer, as to whether or not you are prepared to consider the matter seriously and favourably. lam sure that you would find my proposals most profitable to yourself and your house and l hope that your friendliness will prompt you to ponder over them and give thena full consideration. This is what had to be explained. May you be preserved and Salaam. Translation of a letter from Sheikh Esa bin Ali Al Khalifah, to Major P. Z. Cox, C.LE., Bashire, dated the 2nd Rajab 1324 {23rd August 1906). After compliments —I am in receipt of your esteemed letter dated Jamadi*Al- Thani of the current year, and I have been duly and fully informed of what you con veyed to me, especially your advice to me about the Customs and your wish that more of the great profit should reach me. This is due to your pure kindness and hearty solicitude for my welfare. But, great and good Sir, several times previously have I begged to be excused about the leasing out of the Customs, the reason being that 1 expected a greater return of revenue from them and that I am assured of the undesirability (of farming it out) to the farmers. I have therefore restrict ed myself in taking (advances) from the said farmers, believing that on the expiry of their term of farm l will appoint one who will hold the receiving o£ revenue. Now in the term of their farm is left no more than some months over a year, after which the Customs will come under my hands, and whatever increase will result will accrue to me.

In the event of trade being hampered by the Sheikh trying to manage the Customs himself ©r of his proposing to make them over to subjects of Foreign Powers a suitable opportunity may present itself for interfering effect ively in the administration of the Customs. I am,there fore, to request you to watch the course of events very carefully and to keep the Government of India Informed as to what the Sheikh proposes to do. t I have the honour to be sir, Your most obedient servant Assistant Secretary to the Government of IndiaBAHREIN. The island of Bahrein is situated in a deep bay on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf. It faces the Turkish district of Katif on the west, and the peninsula of El Katr, in which we have more than once formally declined to recognise Turkish authority, on the east and south-east. The following extract from a letter from the Govern],lent of India dated 5th January 19G3 gives a succinct statement of the political geography of the section of the Arabian Coast with which Bahrein is immediately concerned. The places named are mark ed on Curzon 1 s map. H From Koweit to Katif town Ottoman rule has long been recognised, and, in fact, though this has never been explicitly admitted, it would be difficult to dispute Turkish claims to exer cise jurisdiction as far as, and inclusive of, Ojair (Ukair in Curzon 1 s map). South of this place, and on the El Katr peninsula, his Majesty 9 &amp; Government have declined to recognise Turkish sovereignty, though the Turks actually have a garrison at El Bidaa n From and inclusive of Odeid eastward, the coast belongs to the Trucial Chiefs as jar as Rus-el-Kheima. ' Bahrein is of importance as the centre of the pearl fisheries of the Gulf. tt is also the residence of a number of British Indian traders, whose export trade in dates from Katif caused some difficulty with the Turkish Government in 19C4 owing to the extortions of the local Turkish authorities. The local naviga tionnavi gat i on is much harassed hy pirates, with whom it is difficult to deal as the local authorities are inefficient and the Turkish Govenment objects to any action by ourselves in what they claim to be Turkish waters. Cur relations with Bahrein are governed by the treaties of 1861 and 1892. Under the former, the Sheikh agreed to abstain from all acts of maritime aggression, so long as he received British support, and to report all such actions committed against him self or his subjects to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, who would act as arbitrator in disputes and take measures to exact reparation in cases where Bahrein could be proved to be the injured party. The treaty of 1892 provides that the Sheikh shall receive no representative from, nor hold any communication or enter into any agreement with, any Foreign Power; and that he is not to cede, lease, &amp;c, any territory except to the British Government. This latter treaty, which was signed by the present Sheikh Isa, contains no specific promise of protection or good offices. In 1894 we intervened actively on behalf of Bahrein against the Turks and forcibly dispersed a band of Bahreinese malcontents who had settled, under the Turkish flag, at Zobata on the El Katr coast. Again, in the case of the murder in 19GC of Sheikh Isa's cousin by Behaih tribesmen near Eat if in Turkish territory, we restrained the Sheikh from tairing the matter into his own hands and making reprisals on ’one mainland, and have repeatedly urged upon the Turks, though not very successfully, the necessity of making reparation. In connection with the Zobara episode the Porte was informed in 1895 that His Majesty's Govern mentTurkish Anbassador dated 20th Hay 1905. Pol.3003/05. Government 'must repeat once more that all Turkish 'claims to Bahrein, which is under the protection of tne O.ueen of England, are totally inadmissible', Lot^ Lansdtmie^s NcU C i a g ati ° n has been subse 1 uentl y repeated. The Persians apparently have always cherished the belief that Bahrein is part of the Shah's dominions; the question was raised by them in 1843 and 1866. On each occasion r i s Majesty's Government decided that the Persian clams could not be recognised; but no formal statement seems to have been made to the Per~ sian Government. Quite recently the Persians reas serted their claims , and Mr. Grant Buff was, in Feb ruary last, instructed to reply that 'we consider the ,f island and its inhabitants 'to be under British protection and must decline to 'entertain any further representations on the subject.' The Persian claims are not serious, but they are of some importance in that they form, an obstacle to the recognition of our right to protect Bahreinese in Persia. Mr* Grant Buff's telegram to Sir Grey 25th January 1906 (2592/06) In 1901 we recognised the Sheikh's eldest son. Sheikh Homed, as his successor. Sir H. O'Conor, in reporting 072 the Government of India's action, said that any arrangement which strengthened cur authority over Bahrein must be regarded with satisfaction, and added that he would welcome the news that a British or Bri tish Indian subject had been appointed Bi rector of the Bahrein Customs as a material proof of cur authority over the island. Sir II. 0'Conor further pointed out that the Porte, if they thought they could count upon the support of any Foreign Power in assert ing their supremacy over the island, would not lose the opportunity of doing so. In&amp; In this connection it should he mentioned tha'u an inquiry was received from the French Govern ment in July 1904 as to bringing Bahrein within the jurisdiction of their Vice-Consulate at Bushire, the reason given being that French subjects had come to establish themselves on the island and carry on pearl ^ fishing. The Goverrment^were in favour of postponing the reply to the French request, and so far as this Office is aware, the matter has been dropped. It would not be surprising now if Germany also were to raise the question of consular representation in the i si and. In August 1904 the Gov- Mr. Brodrick 9 s despatch dated 5th August 1904 ( 2929 / 04 ) . eminent of India were auth orised, with a view to strengthening our position with the Sheikh, to appoint an officer of the Regular Political Service as Resident, in the place of the existing Agent (appointed in 1901) ^ who was of a lower Jative official status. A small guard of ^Infantry was also sanctioned, and it was a’rranged that a suitable vessel should be placed at the disposal of the Political Officer to be used if necessary in the suppression of piracy in the shallower waters of the coast. This vessel has not yet been provided, but in February last the Government of India told Major Cox that they 584/06 hoped shortly to make arrangements for its provision. Sir II 0 9 Conor *3 despatch Sir 11 0 9 Conor, who was con- of 28 th June 1904. (2929/04) suited, stated that he had felt strongly for some years past, that we were losing the opportunity of asserting our supremr acy in Bahrein, that he sincerely welcomed the propo sals of the Government of India, and that he undertook that the Turkish Government should raise no serious difficulties. fhe officer appointed was Captain Prideaux. Two incidents that took place in Bahrein towardstowards the end of ir04 rendered it neoessanj for us to assert oar authority over Sheikh Isa. Outrages mre oomzitted, in both oases by retainers of the Sheikh*s nephew Sheikh A1 i , upon (1) a Goman named Bahnson, an employ6 of a German firm (2) upon certain Persian subjects. Appeal was made to us in both instances to obtain reparation and to secure the punishment of the offenders. The German case was quickly settled, but as 7'';qards the Persians Sheikh Isa jm* proved refractory, and it was found necessary to send three gunboats to Bahrein to enforce our demands. An ultimatum wax presented on February 24, and the British demands were complied with. Fo force was used. Our demands were (1) the punishment Tel. from Govt, of India, of six of the guilty parties, (2) d/ 21 Jan.05 (267/05) the payment of compensation to the aggrieved Persians, (3) the maintenance of a special guard for kssp+ng order in Panama, the capital Of the tsland f (4) aikhAli's banishment for 5 years, (§) the abolition of the 'Sitfcra' or 'Corv&amp;e” system, which prevailed in Bahrein, So m far as the employ6s of foreigners were concerned. It nay be mentioned that Sheikh Ali made his escape at the time, but he has since be n surrendered and is now under detention in India. The Government of India had hem anxious to seize the opportunity, which tin incident offered, of taking action in regard to the Customs. But their proposal that, in the event of resistance, the Custom House should he seized ahd only given back with Iritish officials in zpodrick*s telegram charge was vetoed by H. .

It nay be explained that, under a system which is still in force, the Sheikh farms out the oust one to certain Indian traders for stated periods. By this means he obtains a oustms revenue of about Bs.2,20,000, vihereas it is calculated that, if properly administered, the customs would bring him in between 3 arid 4 lakhs of rupees annually. Bepe -led representations from British officers (including Lord Curran when in the Gulf in 1903) have f 4 tied to induce the Shaikh to accept our proposals. He has, however, on sev-r I occasions (e.g. in 1S9S and 1002) pr and sea that when the farmers 1 leases fell in they would not be renewed, and in 1901 he declared his intention of himself assuming the direct mmagmmt of his Customs on the expiry of the lease then current, a practice ivhioh was introducedn in 1890 at Muscat. On each occasion he failed to eep his word. His present attitude on the que tion seems to be as momproni sing as ever. At an Interview with Hof or 6ox and Captain Prideaux, at which thC subject was broached, he said n I have always given you an answer on that subject, and 'hove no other (answer to give'.

Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, T° The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to reply to Foreign Department letter No. 4472, dated 6th December 1905, on the subject of the memorial addressed to Government by the Sheikh of Bahrein. 2. I asked the Political Agent, Bahrein, for his views in the first instancej * No. 24 of 19th January 1908. and attach a C0 Py ° f his reply.* It will he seen that he is of opinion that Sheikh Esa’s associate in the despatch of the memorial was Sheikh Mahomed Abdul Wahab Pasha, the Turkish subject, who has recently been reported upon in Maskat diaries and with whose identity the Government of India are familiar. It is quite possible that the Arab, who is a close friend of Goguyer, may have had something to do with it, but I think circumstantial evidence points rather to Monsieur Goguyer himself or his son. They were both at Bahrein with f Bushire Residency Diaries for the weeks ^ party of French pearl merchants in ending 17th September, 8th and 29th October August, September or October 1905, f and 1905 ' it will be noted that the handwriting in which the English translation which accompanied Sheikh Esa’s petition is written, is a continental one, and that the note paper used is the ordinary cross-ruled pattern used by foreign merchants and wdiichto my knowledge was used by Goguyer in Maskat. The handwriting is not Goguyer’s own and probably not his son’s, but very possibly that of Madame Nattan or one of her party. I am endeavouring to obtain specimens of their handwriting, and if any tangible result is arrived at, I will submit a further report later. The prominent position given to Sheikh Esa’s grievance regarding the arms traffic also points to Goguyer; and on the other hand, the inclusion of the English date and the correct names of Lord Minto and Mr. Brodrick, and lastly the idea which prompted the despatch of the memorial through Messrs. Kynoch all suggest a European rather than an Arab co-adjutor. 3. At the conclusion of their communication under reply the Government of India invite my remarks upon the fact that Sheikh Esa employed the Agent of a commercial firm for the transmission of his memorial to the Secretary of State. For so venerable a patriarch Sheikh Esa is very ignorant in such matters, and I think that any remarks addressed to him from the point of view that his action was a breach of etiquette would be lost upon him. Owing, however, to the fact that he has had very little to do with British officers up till quite recently, and in spite of assurances from Captain Prideaux and myself, affects to be uncertain whether all his wishes or representations are communicated to Government, it might be well if I were permitted to make a communication to him on behalf of Government to the effect that while the British Govern ment are always glad to receive and ready to lend a just and sympathetic ear to the legitimate representations of their subjects and dependents; so far as he is concerned they have trusted local representatives whose responsibility and habit it is to communicate his circumstances and wishes to them fully, and that in view of this fact they can only consider his communications when received through those responsible officers and not through the commercial channels to which he has needlessly resorted in the present instance. 4. The arms trade to Bahrein, which is brought into prominence in this correspondence, is only one factor of the general question of the arms trade from Maskat to other parts of the littoral and if, as seems probable, the whole question is now under review by the Government of India, the case of Bahrein will no doubt he considered simultaneously with that of Koweit, with regard to which I had the honour to address Government very recently under my office No. 585 of the 31st December 1905. With regard to the other topics touched upon in Sheikh Esa’s letter, Captain Prideaux’s comment thereon and the general position at Bahrein, I ask permission to postpone any special remarks or recommendations for a 4148 F, D,2 short time. I hope to pay a leisurely visit to Bahrein at an early date to discuss various matters with the Political Agent and the Sheikh, and I shall he in a better position then to address Government fully. I return the original Arabic memorial as directed. The original English translation I take the liberty of keeping for the present. No. 24, dated Bahrein, the 13th January 1906. From —Captain F. B. Prideaux, Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to your office endorsement No. 1956, dated the 26th December 1905, enclosures to which are herewith returned, on the subject of Sheikh Esa-hin AlPs petition, dated the 2nd October 1905, I have the honour to submit the following report: 2. The secret of the despatch of this petition has been extremely well kept in Bahrein, and I doubt if any of the Chief’s subjects except one or two of his relations and bis clerk have had any cognizance of it. The English translation was undoubtedly made in Bombay, and I have no hesitation in expressing the opinion that Sheikh Mahomed bin Abdul Wahab Pasha must have been the Chief’s correspondent and Agent in the matter there. 3. I have asked the Chief why he had not forwarded the petition through me and have pointed out that he would probably have received his answer quicker if he had done so. He replied that he had informed me in his letter of the 30th May 1905 that he would address the Government direct if he did not receive through me an early reply to all his representations, and he had subse quently only carried out this threat. 4. To some extent the Chief’s statement may be considered plausible, as with the exceptions of the long message, which you desired me in your letter No. 781, dated the 11th June 1905, to communicate to him, and of my letter No. 218, dated the 4th July 1905, to which I have referred in the first para graph of my letter No. 237, dated the 16th July 1905, to your address, Sheikh Esa has not been given any definite reply. He has never, however, reminded me of this, nor has he enquired whether Government had in any way modified the message which you had sent to him. Moreover, after acquiescing in the deportation of Sheikh Ali, it seems curious that the Chief should affect to think that we had not been acting entirely under instructions from Government. 5. In the matter of the flag-staff I have pressed the Chief to say whether he now believes that it was lowered under my orders, that it was lowered by my subordinates without my knowledge, or that it was blown down by the wind. He has replied that perhaps the flag-staff was not lowered under my orders, but that he has heard from reliable persons that the sepoys, who were in charge of the house, had intentionally pulled it down. I need hardly say that this accusation is ridiculous. You may, perhaps, however, deem it advisable to call upon the Chief to produce his informants before you, when you next visit Bahrein. 6. It is characteristic of Sheikh Esa that when referring to the two Agree ments of 1880 and 1892 he should make no reference to the numerous occasions on which we have resolutely given him aid and protection, his obtuseness of feeling in this connection having even caused him to omit mention of the important Treaty of 1861 in which the first guarantee of British protection for his State was openly made. r “T 6 astoilisllin n will the Government probably consider the fact of the Chief s objecting to the presence of a British officer in Bahrein. With a community of some 8 or 10 Europeans in the place, a considerable influx of native Christians from Turkey and the large increase of trade enioved by the merchants of Bahrein, many of whom are British subjects, it is not probable that the Government will he impressed by the Chief’s preference for the former system under which a native merchant gave only a portion of his time to their interests. 8. With regard to the Arms Traffic Prohibition I Can only venture to make the following observations with the greatest diffidence, as the Agreement3 on the subject was taken from the Chief before the formation of the Bahrein Political Agency, and I have not been able to reier to any correspondence on the subject. I was First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at the time, however, and if my memory serves me, the Chief was first asked hy Colonel M eade to subscribe to an agreement similar to that which the Sultan of Haskat had just granted. The Government of India, however, considered that such an agreement would not suit the different conditions of Bahrein, and the Sheikh was accordingly desired in language, that 1 fear he must have ’resented as too peremptory, to agree to absolutely prohibit the import and export of arms and ammunition in his dominion. 9. At the same time, I have never heard either from the Chief himself or from any other person that Sheikh Esa was nursing a grievance in this connec tion. Moreover, more than one shop for the sale of arms is well known to exist in Muharraq, nominally to facilitate the sale of weapons imported previous to the^ issue of the prohibition, and I have heard that Sheikh Hamad, whose importations of goods are never scrutinized by the customs farmers, is suspected of being engaged to a considerable extent in the illicit trade. I have been quietly watching this subject for some time past, but have taken no action whatever, except to advise Sheikh Esa to remind M. Goguyer, on the latter’s first arrival here, of the existence of the prohibition. 10. ^ I do not suppose that the Government will consider for a moment the possibility of cancelling or modifying the agreement in force, as the people of Bahrein in general have no personal need for more arms, and the Chief can always obtain the consent of Government to import whatever may he required in special cases. To endeavour to place the other Chiefs on the Arab side of the Gulf on the same footing, if it has not already been done, would appear to be a far more satisfactory alternative. 11. The question whether, and to what extent, the Chief of Bahrein has suffered pecuniary loss from the total suppression of the arms trade can probably be calculated in your office without much difficulty, but to say what proportions of the arms imported into Bahrein w ould ultimately have found their w r ay into Persia, Turkey and independent Arabia respectively is a much less easy matter. My late Munshi Khan Sahib Haji Abbas is of opinion that 50 per cent, went to Persia, 30 to Turkish territory, 10 to Oman, and 10 remained in the islands. 12. I should personally not be surprised to learn that the customs revenue which the Chief now receives is greater than that which he obtained in 1897 including the duty on arms, this fact being largely due to the opening of the two European firms in Bahrein, who were no doubt partially attracted to Manama by the presence of a British Political Officer and the more frequent calls of steamers in that port. In conclusion, I venture to express the opinion that until the Chief exhibits a less obstinate attitude and a greater sense of the benefits he has received, it is not advisable to make him any concessions whatever.

On 21st ultimo, I had the honour to forward the views of Captain Prideaux and myself upon the duplicate petition addressed by Sheikh Esa to His Excellency the Viceroy, and we have little further to add. Since last writing I have obtained specimens of the handwriting of Gogu- yer’s son Jean and of Madame Nattan, but cannot identify either with the writing found in the translation referred to in the first paragraph of Foreign Department letter No. 4472-E.B. There remain Goguyer’s younger son and Madame Nattan’s daughter, who might have written it, but I see no likeli hood of being able to obtain specimens of their handwriting for the present, and therefore have the honour to return the translation in question, together with the Arabic original of the petition to His Majesty s Secretary of State, received with Foreign Department letter No. 4699-E.B., in case the Govern ment of India should think it desirable to institute enquiries through the Police authorities in Bombay. As regards the Maskat trade, Messrs. Kynoch s chief constituents are the British Indian Traders, Damodar Dharamsee, Dhan^ee Purshotum Dhanjee, and a Parsee, named Lodawalla, and also Messrs.

I may remark in conclusion that Sheikh Esa’s reference to the Cnste™. question in his letter of 30th May above referred to, could hardly have be” e n , or properly be taken, as serious. It was simply a suggestion that Government should, without any quid pro quo or compensating advantage whatever, pay off all his debts to the banians and let him conduct the Customs through the medium of Bahrein Arab and Seedi retainers selected by himself I d!d not describe the proposal so baldly, in replying to Sheikh Esa, as I was glad even of this opening, as emanating from Sheikh Esa himself for the discussion of the Customs question. ’ Ior tJle IGIwLg'V^^T’ £ oweve . r ’ fr01 ? tlle re P° rt of my interview with him on the reasonabl^wa^whatever” 0 lc ^ en ^ 1011 ^opfi 11 ? our advice in any serious or Q.

Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to refer to the Secretary of State’s despatch No. 34- (Secret), dated 10th November 1905, on the subject of our policy at Bahrein, forwarded, to me under Foreign Department endorsement No. 4363-E.B. of 30th idem. 2. In that despatch His Majesty’s Government while not deeming it convenient at present to define in precise terms the position of the Sheikh of Bahrein towards the Protecting Power, went on to authorise the Government of India to instruct the Political Authorities in the Persian Gulf to proceed as proposed in paragraph 6 of the draft which formed Appendix A of letter No. 178, (Secret,) dated 14th September 1905, from the Government of India to the Secretary of State. In the paragraph referred to the Government of India pronounced the view that the one question on which they felt compelled to offer authoritative advice was that of Customs reform, and suggested that the best course in the first instance might be for me to have a frank explanation with the Chief on the subject. That explanation I have now had, and it will he seen from the accom panying memorandum of what passed at a long interview between myself, the Political Agent, Bahrein, and Sheikh Esa, on the 14th instant, that the latter has once more refused altogether to accept the advice of the Govern ment of India in this respect, in any form whatever. 3. For speaking plainly to the Sheikh in a friendly way I could hardly have had a more favourable opportunity than that which I have just used. I had invited him in the first place to open his mind and express himself freely to me and had assured him of my desire to help him where possible. In regard to all five topics, mention of which had preceded that of the Customs question, I had lent a patient and sympathetic ear and had promised to represent his wishes or circumstances forthwith, and favourably, to the Gov ernment of India. One might reasonably have expected that this would have paved the way for a sensible exchange of views at all events, and an explana tion of some of the reasons which make the reformation of Sheikh Esa’s Customs so unpalatable to him. On the contrary he was as dogged and unbending as he could well be, much as he was last year wiien I first endea voured to'persuade him to do justice to the injured Persians-an attitude I would remark which he changed altogether two months later when he at length realised that we intended to enforce our demands. He would give no reasons ; he practically would not discuss the question, except to keep repeating that he had given his answer several times before and that it was the same now. 4 I do not think I need say much of the past history of our negotiations in connection with the Bahrein Customs, for the Government of India are already familiar with it. It was fully gone into m their Despatch No. 85, dated 21st Anril 1904, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State, on the subject of our representation at Bahrein. Since then Sheikh Esa has once been formally approached by the Political Agent ; uer mu*. further, the subject was pointedly alluded to in the Ultimatum presented to him last year, and I have now exhaustively pressed it upon him. In tact the record shows that since the beginning of 1898 Sheikh Esa, has been authoritatively approached no less than 9 times in all, by three Residents and one Viceroy in person; and I am driven unwillingly to the conclusion that there now remains no reasonable hope that in this particular matter Sheikh Esa will ever respond to our friendly advice, and that it would he humiliatin D 5363 Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, No. 422, dated 7th Decem ber ll&gt;04.IWk to continue to expose our proposals to rejection without reason. I feel in fact that we have reached a point at which we must either elect to drop the question altogether during Sheikh Esa’s lifetime or put the requisite measures through without consulting him further. The record leads me to think that it is the former course which Government will prefer to take, if the political outlook is held to admit of it. 5. I would ask reference here to the passage in the summary of my interview with Sheikh Esa, in which I asked him if it would not be better for him to con form to our advice with a good grace rather than oblige Government to take measures without consulting him. He replied to this quite casually without exhibitins: the least surprise or concern, and it is my opinion, which I think Captain Prideaux shares, that this stubborn refusal to accept our advice is in a great measure due to a desire to play to the gallery, and to save his amour propre. It is the same sentiment which has made him pretend outwardly to be intensely injured by Sheikh Ali’s banishment, though he is no doubt very glad at heart to be spared his troublesome company. Sheikh Esa knows that we can assume control when 'we choose and probably expects us to do so, and when once this is done in a way which will enable him to satisfy his ignorant entourage that it was beyond his power to prevent it, IJb^lieva„M will soon settle down quietly to the inevitable and will be thankful to us in the sequel for having carried out the measure. I venture to recommend therefore that the Government of India take over the Customs as early as can be conveniently arranged. 6. In expressing this view I should not omit to allude briefly to the fol lowing attendant considerations:— (i) Any salient measure which we take in the Gulf region now-a-davs is sure to evoke hostile criticism from unfriendly quarters. It goes without saying that the course now proposed will prove no exception ; but the longer we delay the more criticism we are likely to have to face and there is surely no reason why such a consideration should deter us from a fixed purpose. (ii) Secondly, our action at Bahrein will no doubt have an influence one way or the other, on the parallel question which is pending at Maskat. I am personally inclined to think that the effect will be favourable and useful to us and will tend to dispose the Sultan to accept the inevitable either at once, or a little later when he sees the favourable financial results of the change at Bahrein. This however is a problem in regard to which I would prefer that the Government of India should be influenced by Major Grey’s views rather than my own as he is the officer who has immediately to deal with the Sultan in regard to the Maskat question. For the rest, apart from broad consiterations of international policy lying beyond ray horizon, it appears to my humble judgment not only convenient but necessary that we should take some early step of a kind which will, within the limits prescribed by the policy of His Majesty’s Government publicly strengthen and affirm our authority over Bahrein. At \ The present moment as the Government of India are aware the Persian Foreign Office, tutored no doubt bv the Russian Legation and encouraged by the Article in the “ Hablel Matin ” of the 27th of March 1905, is energetically attempting to revive the nl/t assertion of Persian rights over Bahrein. Again, Foreign European Merchants continue from time to time to discuss their claims to ex-territoriality and Consular intervention in regard to their affairs. The assumption of the Bahrein Custorr s will in all probability put a stop to such indications, whereas there can be little doubt that if we do not nip them in 4he bud they will gather force as time goes on. J 7. As to the financial aspect of the question, I solicit reference to mv predecessors letter No. 38, dated 18th Februarv 1904, of which little modi Uon is needed to bring the information contained in it up to date. luulIJca -It will be seen from paragraph 4 thereof that four-fifths of the revenue is framed by Messrs. Gungaram Tikamdass for the years February 1906 to Janu ary 1908 for Rs. 96,000 per annum. On the account for these two years I understand that Sheikh Esa has already received Rs. 76,000 in advance which he has presumably spent and that he now receives from the farmer Rs. 4,500 per mensem. The existing farm for the remaining one-fifth of the revenue expires in April 1906, when Sheikh Esa proposes to take it over himself, or what he is pleased to call taking it over himself. He has already within the last fortnight or so contracted loans amounting to Rs. 20,000 on the security of this one-fifth, on which he has drawn bills; and he will no doubt continue to hypothecate it up to the utmost limit. This means that he has had nearly the whole of his revenue for the year 1906-1907 in advance. Besides this he is believed to have had a considerable portion of the value of the pearls belonging to the estate of Seyyid Khalaf as explained in my letter No. 75 of to-day’s date. His financial position therefore is as unsatisfactory as it could well be. On the other hand, local merchants with the best opportunities of know ing the facts inform the Political Agent that if properly conducted not three lakhs but five, could be realised from the Customs. 8. The question of the treatment to be accorded to the British Indian Eirm which at present has the farm, does not seem to be a very difficult or complicated problem. They have repeatedly been informed of our intention to administrate the Customs and it would seem to be quite sufficient for us to pay them the balance due to them of the price which they paid for the farm, with reasonable interest, by monthly or quarterly instalments recovered from the Customs receipts. If the Government of India preferred to pay off the whole in cash at once, as suggested in paragraph 7 of Colonel Kemball’s letter under^ reference, so much the better. In any case a statement of account which was correct to-day might require modification to-morrow so that it would be necessary that 'the precise figures should be finally gone into on the spot should the Government of India decide to move at an early date in the direction of the assumption of the Bahrein Customs. Memorandum of what passed at an interview between the Sheikh of Bahrein, the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent at Bahrein, on the 14th February 1906. The weather being somewhat uncertain and Sheikh Esa having asked to be excused coming over to Manama as he was suffering from a cold and cough, which made it inadvisable for him to go abroad, Captain Prideaux and I arranged to spend the day at Muharraq on the 14th February. I had re quested Sheikh Hamad the evening before to ask his^ father to make a list of or keep in mind any topics which he might wish to discuss with me. We found the Sheikh apparently in his usual health, and he said he ras feeling better, but he was actually troubled with a slight cough. He was iccompanied by his three sons, Hamad, Mahomed and Abdulla, and a on of Sheikh Hamad, who however disappeared before we began to talK msiness. After the usual formal enquiries had been exchanged and coffee served ' told the Sheikh that I had come over to stay for two or three days, and ■eminding him of my message of the evening before asked him it there were my special matters which he desired to discuss with me.4 He replied at once in the affirmative saying that there were two or three ^matters affecting him in regard to which there had been neglect {alec) on our (1) Murder of Sheikh Selman bin Diaij. Vide P ar *' B e»g 8Sk e d to explain he Went Foreign Department endorsement No. OH 10 Say til&amp;t tllG tlrst SUuJGCt to Wnicll dated 12 th January 1905 . referred was that of the murder of his kinsman Sheikh Selman bin Diaij by Behaih tribesmen. More than five years he said, had now passed since the outrage had occurred ; but Government had persistently refused to let him exact reparation himself and yet had not seen fit to exact it for him. At this point I sent for my file of the case which among others I had brought over, and explained to him, as far as was permissible, what had passed up to the last assertion of the Porte that Turkish troops had killed 37 out of 50 men concerned. The accuracy of this Sheikh Esa denied, and further contended that any men who had been killed had not been killed in connection with this case at all, and had indeed inflicted much severer losses on the Turkish troops than they had suffered themselves. To the suggestion that after all the incident in question was really an item, and not the first one, in a tribal blood feud, he replied that this was true but that it was the Behaih who had begun the feud and that they were still several lives to the good. He coniinued that he only wanted justice; that if Government could not give it him in one of the forms in which he asked for it, they should at least let him exact reparation in his own way. The two alternatives were, he repeated, the delivery to him of 3 Behaih for execution ; or the payment of blood money for the lives of those murdered and compensation for tneir looted property. He added in conclusion that he would prefer the delivery of 3 men for execution to the monetary settlement. I explained to him that the delivery to him of 3 possibly innocent men for execution in cold blood would not he a course to which the British Govern ment could lend itself, but with regard to the rest I would make another representation to Government. Sheikh Esa then went on to prefer his second complaint which°was with (2) The piracies of Ahmed bin Selman. Vide reference to the piracies of Ahmed bin ] f 0 J re J ig , n ^ I ? e ? artmeilt 1 ^ 0rseirent No - 21 7 -e.b., Selman. Here again he said Governmont nau taken no effective punitive or deter rent measures and yet, as in the Behaih case, we would not allow him to act for himself as he desired. He admitted that Captain Prideaux had done his utmost by personal effort and said that the “Sphinx ” had indeed cruised about hut that this was of no use, for the pirates could see her miles off. He conti nued that his interests had in these matters suffered immensely; that the pirates from not being punished were becoming or had become the more audacious and might at any time be expected to cross over and commit raids on outlying villages of the Bahrein Islands. I explained to him how Govern ment were not in the least forgetful of this matter and were doing their utmost to suppress the piracies and I went on to repeat to him Captain Prideaux’s argument that his own measures would probably only end in the murder of a few innocent people ; but he would not be convinced and said he either claimed effective steps on the part of Government or permission to supnress the marauders m his own way. r . 18 \ doubtful if he really imagines that he has any well founded grievance m this connection, and Captain Prideaux considered that he had only put the matter forward, as something specious to complain about. Next Sheikh Esa referred once again to the alleged throwing down of the ShSSifESrr' the rlagstafi “ ™ the house at Manama which . , j , , had been the residence of Sheikh Ali I asked him had he not been assured by the Political Agent that the flagstaff had nol been thrown down and had he not at the time Withdrawn the statement why then did he persistently return to the charge ? He replied that he onlv Icnew what his people at Manama told him. I rejoined that he had the Politi eal Agent sword for it and my word for it that the flagstaff had not been thrown down either with our knowledge or by our orders and that it had not m fact, been thrown down at all, but had fallen down in a gale of wind T continued that it was incredible that in spite of our repeated assurances he should continue to give credence to the malicious statements of mischief makers r v twho might tell him the contrary. I continued that as far as the flag was con cerned he flew it on Manama Eort and could fly it anywhere else he liked if he so desired. With regard to the house itself I told him that it had never been the decision of Government to confiscate it outright, as I had clearly told him. That the simple fact was that Sheikh Ali had lived in it under the Bahrein Flag and had used the circumstance that it was called “ Government House ” to assist his endeavours to interfere in the Government of Manama and to display opposition to the Sheikh. For this reason, when Sheikh Ali had been removed, it had been decided that until we were assured that affairs in Manama were in a more settled state it was not desirable that the house should be occupied by any of his family. I concluded that if he set such store on the possession of the house and if he showed himself amenable to advice in other ways, I was quite ready to ask Government for permission to hand the house over to him on the distinct understanding that it was a private house and that he would let no one live in it at any time whose tenancy was not approved by the Political Agent. He readily agreed to this and thanked me for my readi ness to further his wishes in this matter. He finally referred to Sheikh All’s allowance and begged that it might be (4) The rednction of Sheikh All’s subsistence reduced. He said that according to his allowance from Rs. 600 to Rs. 300 . information Sheikh Ali did not spend more than Rs. 100 per mensem; that Rs. 200 was enough and Rs. 300 gene rous. I told him again what had passed and promised to approach Govern ment on the subject again. Taking up the thread now on my own behalf, I said that while Govern ment had been obliged to show him last year that they could not be trifled with, they wished him to understand that they were anxious to help him and advance the prosperity of his state in every way they could, and in the same spirit, with regard to the matters just discussed, I added that I would represent them sympathetically to Government. I then turned to his petition to the Secretary of State and His Excellency the Viceroy and asked Sheikh Esa what had prompted him to use an Arms Manufacturer as a medium for the transmission of his petition when he had a Political Agent with him whose duty it was to represent his communications to Government. He replied that he had sent it as he had not received favour able or definite answers to his requests, but had not intended specially to send the document through an Arms Merchant; that he had simply given it to an “Arab” to post and that the latter happened to employ the medium of the Eirm in question. Referring to the con tents of it, I asked him why he made such a prominent grievance of this pro hibition against the importation of arms at this stage and never before; why had he not done so in the first instance ? Hid he experience any difficulty in getting leave to import what he wanted for his legitimate use ? Sheikh Esa replied that the agreement had been taken from him arbitra rily ; that he had simply been shown the Sultan of Maskat’s agreement and a draft like it and had been told that he must sign the latter and signed it with out due reflection ; that he had no difficulty in getting what he wanted for his requirements but that the prohibition had proved a great loss to him in the matter of Customs revenue. Finally he explained that he had not intended to put the matter forward as a grievance but rather as an explanation in the hope that Government would show him favour in the matter. I tried to elicit from him the approximate amount which he considered he formerly received from c uty on arms but he professed not to be able to tell me. I reminded him that he was not alone in the matter but that the Sheikhs of Koweit and the Trucial Coast had notified similar prohibitions. I added that I would represent what he had just said to Government but could not say what their answer would be. Having referred again, as I looked through the memorial, to the disposal (6) Bahr.mCu.toms. of Slleikh Ali ’ S houS , e ther i eill 1 a , llu&lt; J e . d ^ Foreign Department endorsement No, 4363-E.B., X repeated my readiness to help him in dated aoth November 1905. ^i s an( j 0 ther items if he was ready to (5) The prohibition against the importation of Arms into Bahrein.

Sheikh Esa replied “ what sort of matters do you mean ? ” I replied “ any important matters of tration in regard to which Government gives yon advice for your good. He replied “ I must consider whether such and such a measure is for my good or A not, and if I decide that it is, I will inform Government and if I consider that it does not suit me then I will inform Government likewise . Well I replied ‘‘ you mentioned just now that there had been neglect ( ,? tt the part of Government in regard to some of your affairs; I repeat the assurance that there has been no neglect, but on the contrary your affairs have been constantly under the consideration of Government for the last year, as vou may judge from this bulky file before me, and there is one subject which it is evident to me from the correspondence which has passed, Government will not entirely drop and that is the matter of your Customs. He replied nuickly I have already given you an answer on that subject, and have no other answer to give.” I continued “ Let me explain. Government see you constantly in debt and not knowing where to turn for money, because you only set Ks. 1,20,000 from your Customs when you might get three or four lakhs. Their simple wish is that you should get the full benefit of your Customs revenue and that your State and yourself should profit by it.^ There is no wish to annex your Customs nor interfere unnecessarily in your administration; all that is wanted is that you should accept from Govern ment trained employes, of a stamp which your own following cannot supply; men who would conduct your Customs on regular lines and pay you the resulting profit He replied that he had discussed all this with Colonel Meade, Colonel Kemball and myself before, and had always given the same answer, and his answer was the same now whether it be written or spoken. I then appealed to his three sons and asked them whether they could not influence their father, but they said they were in his hands. The old Sheikh went on to say that when the Bunnia’s contract had expired (they have only just started a new one lasting till January 1908) he would take the Customs into his own hands but would have none other than his own servants, Arabs of Bahrein, and that he would not have anyone from Government. I repeatedly asked him to explain to me in a friendly way what were the reasons which prompted him to adopt this attitude but he answered each time that he had no reasons to give except that he was not prepared to accept the measure pro posed, in any form. I then said to him “When I tell you frankly before your sons that this improvement in the Administration of your Customs is a matter with regard to which Government consider that it is incumbent upon you to conform to their advice, repeatedly and seriously given, and when I assure you that they will surely not accept a complete refusal on your part especially when it is accom panied by no reasons whatever, sound or otherwise, do you not think you would be much better advised to agree to the adoption of our proposals wholly or partially, of your own accord, rather than that Government should be driven to dispense with your acquiescence and do what is best for you whether you like it or not ? ” He replied “ If Government wish to do so against my wishes it is of course within their power, but it will not be done with my consent”. Again and again were the same explanations made to him and the same ground gone over as had been traversed before by Colonel Meade, Colonel Jiemball, His Excellency Lord Curzon, and myself, but without the least response or result, and feeling that there was no hope of moving him from his stubborn attitude, I gradually changed the subject and went on to deal with two or three other topics which required mention. These were (1) The Slave Agreement from the Howasir Sheikhs which Sheikh Esa has notified his ii ability to exact. (Vide Foreign Department letter No. 3351-E. B., dated 4th September 1905, paragraph 6.) (2) The case of the Estate of Seyyid Khalaf and outstanding British claim against it (vide last enclosure to letter No. 331, dated 16th July 1905, from the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Depart ment.)No. 2111-E.B. Prom R. E. HOLLAND, Esq., I.O.S., Assistant Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, To Major P. Z. COX, G.I.E., Political Besident in the Persian Gulf % Pushire, Simla, the 22nd May 1906, Sir, I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with your letter No. 73, dated the 25th Pebruary 1906, on the subject of Sheikh Esa’a memorial. 2. I am to request that you will now forward to the Sheikh a reply couched in the following terms The necessary references to communications made by yourself or your predecessors or by the Assistant Political Agent to the Sheikh should be inserted in the letter. “ The Government of India have received the memorial, dated October 2nd of n 1905 , which you addressed to the Viceroy and Governor-General, and have «i given it their careful consideration. You complain firstly that representatives •i 0 f the British Government obliged you to interdict the sale of arms and that ««you were thereby deprived of an advantage enjoyed by all the Arab Chiefs along “ the Arabian Coast. I am to remind you in the first place that in 1895, when you •« we re in danger of an attack by Sheikh Qasim bin Thani, you yourself restricted •* the importation of arms by granting a concession to your Vizier to import arms “ and ammunition subject to the express condition that arms were not to be sold _ j , T . . .„ . . ,, “at Bahrein or on the neighbouring Arab Reports appended to Lieutenant-Colonel Meades ^ ^ .i • letters No. 34, dated 16th May 1898, and No. (59, “Coast. Your object lU ^ imposing this d H ted 2 i»t November 1898. 14 restriction was to curtail as far as pos- “sible the importation of arms which might be used against you, and your i« family. Shortly afterwards when you heard that the holders of the concession “ were evading the condition which prohibited sales to the inhabitants of Bahrein “ or on the Arab Coast, you ordered your Vizier to stop the importation altoge- “ ther. In pursuance of this policy you attached a large quantity of imported “ arms in January 1898 on your own initiative and without being prompted or “ advised to do so in any way by representatives of the British Government. In Pebruary 1898, the Resident at Bushire informed you of the desire of Lieutenant'Coionei Meade’, letter No. 7. du.d “the Government of India to prohibit 23rd February 1898. “ traffic in arms and you at once, and “ without any hesitation or protest, issued a notification announcing that you “ had resolved to assist the British and Persian Government in suppressing the “ trade in arms and ammunition between Bahrein, India and Persia. In April “ 1898, at the request of the Resident you issued, again without protest or “ objection of any kind, a revised notification prohibiting absolutely the impor- Lieutenant-Colonel Meade’, letter No. 39 , d.t e d “ tation of arms and ammunition into, and 30 th May 1898 . “ the exportation of the same from the “ Island of Bahrein. In this notification you referred to a previous notification2 ** which you had spontaneously issued in January 1896, forbidding the sale of “arms and ammunition to your subjects In view of these facts, the Goyem- “ ment of India are unable to understand on what grounds you now represent “ that you were forced by British representatives to interdict the sale of arms. “ Further you are well aware that the Sheikh of Koweit and the Sheikhs of “ the Trucial Coast have similarly prohibited the traffic in arms in their terri- “ tories, and your statement that you are deprived of an advantage enjoyed by “ all the Arab Chiefs along the Arabian Coast is therefore incorrect. Finally “ I am to remind you that the people of Bahrein in general have no need for “ more arms than they possess, and that it is always open to you to procure the “ consent of the Government of India to import whatever arms you may “yourself need for special reasons. It is to your own interest that the “ importation of arms should he restricted, but apart from this the Government “ of India would not consider for a moment the possibility of cancelling or «* modifying the agreement into which you have entered, since it is essential for the preservation of the public peace that the traffic iu arms along the Arabian Coast should be rigidly confined and limited. “In the second place you complain that an English representative has “been substituted for the former Mussulman representative of the British Gov- ‘f ernment in your State and that, as a consequence of his interference in the “ internal administration of the state, you were forced to arrest your relative “Sheikh Ali and surrender him to the British authorities for an imaginary “ offence. In reply to this, I am to remind you that the political and commercial “conditions in Bahrein have considerably altered of recent years and that in “ consequence it has become necessary for the Government of India to have a “ more efficient representative, on whose advice you can more confidently rely, “ It is also well known to you that the great increase of trade enjoyed by the “ merchants of Bahrein is largely due to the presence of a British officer in “ your island. “ With regard to the case of Sheikh Ali, your nephew, you know that “ he was punished, because he rebelled against your orders and set at naught the “ commands of the British Government. I have already addressed you on this “ subject in my letter dated June 7th, 1905, and it is not necessary for me to say “ anything more with regard to the matter here. “Next you represent that your flag mast was thrown down by the Enclosure to letter from the Political Rtsident, No. “ British authorities. The Government 259 , dated nth June 1905. « 0 f India cannot believe that you are ‘‘actuated by serious motives in preferring this complaint after the Political Agent has given you a personal assurance, which you have accepted, to the effect that the flagstaff was not lowered, but was blown down in a heavy gale. “ Finally, the Government of India are unable to understand your allega- 11 tion that you receive no reply to the representations which you prefer. “ I, who am the representative of the Government of India in the Persian Gnlf, “ have written to you in reply to your complaints explaining the policy of the “Government of India and advising you for your good, while your Political Agent, Captain Prideaux, has constantly listened to your grievances and assisted “ you with his counsels. In this connection I am to remind you that it is the “ duty of British representatives to communicate fully to Government the cir- “ oumstances and wishes of Chiefs to whom they are accredited, and that in view “of this fact the Government of India can only consider your communications “ when received through the responsible officers with whom you are in touch. “ It was therefore both unnecessary and incorrect for you to forward a copy of “ your petition to the Secretary of State for India through the medium of a “ commercial firm.” I have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient servant, E.

Annex. Petition from the Sheikh of Bahrein. (Translated from the Arabic, j I lay open my complaint hereby to the gracious British Imperial Government’s compassion. About six years ago I was in perfect quietness, pleased with your representatives’ usages, disposing myself of the things of the principality without any interference, and all the natives were pleased with me and my treating them. Merely between your State (whose power God save!) and me there was two agreements, dated 19th Muharram 1298 (corresponding to the 22nd December 1880) and 14th Shaban 1309 (corresponding to the 13th March 1892), by which I had bound myself not to enter into negotiations nor make treaties of any sort with any State or Government other than the British without the consent of the said British Government, and to refuse permission to any other Government than the British to establish diplomatic or consular agencies or coaling depots in my territory, unless with the consent of the British Government. But, as to the home matters, I was a ruler as the Bahrain rulers my predecessors without difference, except that the British Government had here a representative under whose jurisdiction your subjects w r as lain. But that agent was a Mussulman, knowing the exigences of the religion of the principality people and all the Mussulmans, betw r een whom and him the relations were extremely easy. But, these six years ago, my tranquillity changed in trouble, and I became grieved with the vexations of your representatives, and their lowering my situation without motive from me. 1. At first, your representatives obliged me to interdict the sile of arms, and I became deprived of this advantage, I only, among the Arabs* Chiefs ; for it is a free trade elsewdiere on all the Arabian coast.2 Later the Mussulman representative here was replaced tor an English one, who meddled himself with the home matters and arrogated to himself the competency in wind was no business of his, thoug . ignorant of the religious law and customs ot tne Mussulmans. Here is an example of what resulted ol that. , A German merchant evinced contempt for one of my family s princes, the Shaikh Ali, a son of my late brother Ahmad and in some way one of mv sons, married with my daughter Then three men of war went in front of the Principality capital, for the sake ol that Hernia merchant, and staid there many days, threatening and preparing for battle with ns. * „ , . * 3 Afterwards your representatives asked me tor delivering mv son, the Shaikh Hamad, to them, and I, for my respect to Britain, delivered him to them ; then they arrested him and kept him prisoner on board of one of the vessels. xi 4. They seized upon the house of mine at which I had authorised the Shaikh Ali to live in; they possessed themselves of all his personal properties, horses, thoroughbred camels, household goods, utensils, &amp;c.; they carried all that; to Bushire, Kuweit and Muscat, except a part which burned. . 5 As Shaikh Ali had tied for fear, your representatives requested me to proclaim order to arrest him, and I did so, not willingly but by force. . , (j. On account of the quarrel which had happened between the German and the iUi’s servants, your representatives ordered and gathered a line, and I must have got scourged violently the Shaik All’s servants in presence of the Political Resident of the Persian Gulf and the Political Assistant at Bahrain. Accordingly, that affair was a settled one, when, at my amazement, happened the event aforesaid. 7. When Shaikh Ali surrendered, asking for indulgence from the gracious Imperial Government, lie was arrested and is yet a prisoner. 5. They threw clown my flag mast, the sign of my rank. 9. After ail that I wrote to your representatives that they state to the gracious Government the vexations I had suffered; hut no reply reached me from them. Accordingly I try to move your pity, and I request from your justice and equity that you restore me in my previous quietness and content ment; for it is the state that suit you as well as us, and thereby your reputation will be retrieved among the people of these countries. I wrote this in tw r o copies, one of which I send to the Viceroy of India, His Excellency Lord Minto, and the other to the Secretary of State for India, His Excellency Mr. Brodrick. All of us pray God in behalf of Great Britain for ever. God save you! The 3rd Shaban 1323 ( = 2nd October 1905). (Signed and sealed from) Issa bin Ali Al Khalifa, the ruler of Bahrain.

It will he seen that, as a sequel to the naval demonstration which took place in February last owing to the unsatisfactory attitude adopted by the Sheikh in regard to the punishment of the authors of certain outrages on foreigners in the island, Major Cox made certain recommendations with a view to securing guarantees for the more satisfactory administration of affairs in the future. The measures which he proposed were :— (a) The appointment of a Wazir selected for him by the Government of India to carry on the government of Manama under the immediate guidance of the Political Agent. (b) The creation of a small police force under a native police officer of the Government of India. (c) The warning of the present Ruler’s heir, Sheikh Hamed, that, in spite of the recognition given by the Government of India to his right to succeed, their ultimate acquiescence in his succession will depend entirely on his satis factory demeanour from this day forward. (d) The exercise by the Political Agent of his influence with Sheikh Esa, in order to prevail upon him to allow his grandson, Khalifa, to he sent to India for a time for education and training in view of the possibility of his eventual selection to succeed in place of Sheikh Hamed. In accordance with instructions, the Political Agent has delivered the warning suggested under (c). Major Cox’s proposal as to (d) has also been sanctioned. 3 As regards the proposed appointment of a Wazir, Major Cox’s attention was drawn to 3 some of the difficulties which stood in the way of carrying out the suggestion, and he was reminded that the reform of the Customs adminis tration was still the first question to which the Political Agent should address himself. A further report was also called for, and in reply Major Gox sub mitted certain proposals by Captain Prideaux, which may be summarised as follows:— . (a) That it would be better that, until the Political Agent has acquired adequate influence over the Sheikh, no steps whatever should be taken to press upon Sheikh Esa the proposals recommended originally in the Resident s letter No. 123 (Confidential) o£ 11th March last and referred to in this Depart. ) y , ^ ^A ment letter No. 1873 E.-B. of 17th May.2 (b) That the Political Agent should be authorised to intervene with direct advice to the Chief in the following matters, namely,— (i) the oppression exercised by the A1 Khalifa family, the Magisterial and Revenue officials, and the Kazis; (ft) the extravagant entertainment of Bedouins; (m) the reform of the land revenue administration; (iv) legal disputes between the Sheikh and his subjects. Major Cox concurred in the advisability of adopting Captain Prideaux’s first suggestion; but before submitting any definite opinion on his other proposals, he invited a pronouncement of the Government of India on the proposition that there was no middle course between the two policies of treating Bahrein (1) as a full British Protectorate; (2) as an independent principality. A reply, copy of which we have the ppen lx * honour to enclose,* has now been drafted to Major Cox’s letter, laying down what are considered in practice to be the approximate limits of the British Protectorate in Bahrein, so far as it v has yet been developed; the principles are also defined by which Captain Prideaux should be guided in his relations towards the ruler of the island. As, however, the points dealt with in the drait letter involve the consideration of important questions of international law, and moreover bear indirectly on the general subject of the British position in the Persian Gulf, we are postponing its issue until His Majesty’s Government have had an opportunity of considering it and of stating whether they approve of its terms.

Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, r ^° Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. Captain Prideaux had been asked for his opinion in regard to your telegram No. 85-E. B., dated the 6th January 1905, and in the event of the Sheikh refusing to comply with the order of Government, my reply thereto suggested that the following threats might he tried prior to the ultimate one of bombarding Muharrag: first, that our recognition of his son as heir apparent may be withdrawn; second, that troops may be located in Bahrein at the expense of the Sheikh ^ or of ourselves; third that pending liquidation a heavy fine with partial control over revenue may be imposed. The first I agree with, but doubt whether it would have much effect by itself. I see no advantage in the second except that so far it may prove absolutely necessary for the safety of the European community. The third involves control over Customs and would entail the location of troops also unless the Sheikh were first subdued. In any case we might use the first threat incidentally, but I think that the threat to shell the Sheikh’s residence in Muharrag if he does not comply within a specified time, will be simplest plan and will prove sufficient. Captain Prideaux also suggests consideration of the possible expediency of the expulsion of the two troublesome Mullas.

To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. Fox and Redbreast await orders at Bushire ; Sphinx is at Bahrein. I want No. 608-E.B., dated Fort William, the 10 th February 1905. From—The Assistant Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, 5078 F. D.* Draft Memorandum. 1. I am desired first to remind you of the long, continued friendship and support which have been accorded by the British Government to the rulers of Bahrein. 2. I have next to remind you that these favours have also been extended to you personally. Upon the death of your father, Sheikh Ali-bin-Khalifah, the British Gov ernment caused the usurper, Muhammad-bin-Abdulla, to be expelled, and yourself installed in your father’s place. You have ever since received the support of the British Government. 3. In February 1901, you were notified that, in accordance with your express wish, the British Government recognised your son, Sheikh Hamed, as your successor to the Chieftainship. 4. They further offered you the services of a British officer to administer with more efficiency the Customs of Bahrein. This offer you refused. 5. These are evidences of the friendly and benevolent spirit which has been consistently displayed towards you by the British Government. You owe in the main to them your present position, the means that you enjoy, and your continued occupation of the Chieftainship. 6. Notwithstanding these facts, and notwithstanding the assurances which have been given by you, especially on the occasion of the imprisonment in 1873 of a mail agent in the employ of a British Trading Company, when you promised to abide, “ Inshallah”, by the advice of the Political Besident, you have not maintained your friendship towards the British Government, and have conducted yourself in a manner which cannot be permitted to continue. 7. You have now refused to accept advice which I have repeatedly offered on behalf of the British Government, with a view to the amicable settlement of the difficulties which have arisen in connection with the recent assault by subjects of yours on certain Persians. The words used by you, when I last visited you on the 8th December 1904, were—“ I have only olie answer to give, namely, that I will do nothing in this case except after trial by my own Shariat or Urf Court ”. You w r ere then informed why this procedure could not be agreed to, and, though every consideration has been shown to you, you still remained obdurate, and thus bar the way to a satisfactory conclusion being arrived at. You have also in spite of my own repeated representations and those of the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, Captain Prideaux, entirely failed to keep under proper control your nephew, Sheikh Ali, who is undoubtedly responsible in a great measure for the present outrage on Persians, as well as for the recent attack on the German, Mr. Bahnson, for the illegal application of Sukhra, or forced labour, on the employes of the German, Mr. Wonkhaus, and for the forcible removal from the British mail steamer “ Kangra ” of certain baggalas last December. 8. Matters have now come to a point w T hen the British Government can no longer, consistently with their own dignity and your permanent interests, discuss these matters with you, and I am, therefore, instructed to make the following demands upon you :— (1) I am to demand that six of the ringleaders in the attack against Persian subjects shall, immediately after identification, receive 24 stripes each and a term of imprisonment or expulsion from the island. (2) I am to demand that Rs. 2,000 shall be paid as compensation to the Persians through the Assistant Political Agent. (3) I am to demand that you shall station a special guard of your own trusted men on duty in Manama to maintain order in the bazaar. (4) I am to demand that Sheikh Ali-bin-Ahmed shall leave Bahrein forthwith, and that he shall not be permitted to return there for a period of five years, counting from the date on which he now leaves Bahrein.(5) I am to demand that the existing system of “Sukhra”, or forced labour, shall be stringently prohibited as far as employes of foreigners are concerned, and that a public notification to that effect shall he issued in terms to be approved by the British Government. ^ ... (61 Finally I am to warn you that further rejection of advice in important matters will not be tolerated; and that, in the event of any continuance or re- petition of an unfriendly attitude on your part, all support and assistance, whether diplomatic or military, which you and your predecessors have enjoyed, will he withdrawn from you, and may possibly take another direction. It is imnossible for the British Government to continue their support and protection to a Chief who continues obdurate to all reasonable advice for his welfare, and assumes an unfriendly attitude towards their officers.

Further, Sheikh should be reminded of his assurances to follow the advice of the Political Besi- dent, in breach of which he has failed to redress the violence done to Persians, the illegal application of Sukhra and “ Kangra ” incident, and to keep under control Sheik Ali, who is the author or instigator of Persian and Bahnson outrages.

On the other hand, it is important that the Sphinx and the Redbreast as well as the Fox should be retained here for Bahrein work. If, therefore, Your Excellency can manage to retain all three for Bahrein demonstration, I pro pose to send the Lawrence to Mahot instead of the Redbreast^ whose services will be specially valuable, seeing that the Commander has just completed surveying Bahrein and has intimated his local knowledge.

From-— Major P. Z. Cox., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Officiating Secretary to the tiovernmeut of India in the Foreign Depart ment. In continuation of the correspondence ending with Foreign Department telegram No. 744-E. B., dated 18th February, to my address, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of^India, a report regarding the measures since taken at Bahrein. 2. I arrived at Bahrein on the evening of 23rd February in H. M. S- Redbreast^ which had been placed at my disposal by the Senior Naval Officer in lieu of the Lawrence recently deputed to assist the operations of the Gazetteer party on the southern coast of Oman. At Bahrein there were already EL. M. S. Sphinx, which had been on duty there for some days as guard-ship, and H. M. S. Fox under the command of Captain J. B. Eustace, Senior Naval Officer, which had preceded me from Bushire. In order to save daylight I did not wait for the Sheikh’s usual visit on hoard hut landed at once and asked him to pay his visit at the Agency the following morning. Captain Prideaux, Assistant Political Agent, had kept him informed as far as possible of my movements and had advised him, for the more expedi tious transaction of business, to take up his residence at Manama during my stay, but this he had not arranged to do, and when I arrived he was himself residing at Muharrug as usual, while his son Sheikh Earned, with his zenana, was absent at his country-house some miles outside the town. Sheikh Esa, however, came over to call upon me in the morning as requested, accompanied only by his young grandson Khalifa, an apparently nice boy of 14 or 15 years, whom the Chief almost invariably has in his company. The Senior Naval Officer and Captain Prideaux were present at the interview and the usual formalities were exchanged. As soon as these were concluded I informed the Sheikh that I had come over to make an important communication to him on behalf of Government and requested him to be present at the same hour next morning to receive it. He expressed his willingness to do so, and as he had already been informed by Captain Prideaux, at the time of the settlement of the German case, that had the orders of Government been received in time, Sheikh Ali would not have been allowed to return, I thought it as well to warn him before leaving that the departure of his nephew from Bahrein was an item of the decision of Government in regard to the recent cases, and that he had better cause him to make preparations for early departure. I also told him that his son Hamed’s proper j)lace was beside his father, and that I hoped that he would be forthwith summoned from his suburban residence. 3. The Chief arrived up to time next morning, accompanied by his son Abdulla and the grandson before mentioned and was received with suitable honours at the Agency. His eldest son Hamed was still absent, but was expected. With me were the Senior Naval Officer, Captain Prideaux, Assistant Political Agent, Cammander Bowman of H. M. S. Sphinx, and Lieutenant Gabriel, now at Bahrein on Gazetteer duty. The ultimatum of Government was duly presented to the Chief in the detailed form, of which a translation forms Enclosure No. 1 of this report. The only special remark which the terms of it seem to call for is in reference to Demand No. 1, to which I added the names of the four persons who had before been flogged and expelled in connection with the German case, but who had since been allowed by Sheikh Esa to reappear in Manama. Having mastered the details of the ultimatum as now presented to him, the Sheikh proceeded to press persistently and to advance every possible pretext for an extension of the time, namely, 24 hours, given for compliance, and an analysis of his protestations made it evident that it was especially in connection2 with the deportation of Sheikh Ali that he was so anxious to gain time. In view, however, of the fact that he had already had tw o months in which to ponder over my previous demands and his own position, and that the foundation of his present attempts to procrastinate could hardly be anything else than the hope of ultimately evading our demands, his successive entreaties for six, five, four, three or even two days were not acceded to, and as soon as he had been furnished with a copy of the ultimatum the meeting was adjourned until the following morning. I would draw attention here to the fact that throughout my previous visit and up to now the contingency of his being impotent to produce either Sheikh Ali or the other men wanted had never been suggested or allowed by the Sheikh. On the contrary he had always sought to preserve the polite fiction that they were entirely under his control. 4. Shortly after noon Sheikh Abdulla returned to the Agency and informed Captain Prideaux that having been ordered by his father, on leaving our presence, to send another summons to his brother and uncle, and also to warn Sheikh Ali to present himself before the Chief at Muharrug, he had in due course proceeded to Sheikh All’s house and from the latter’s response he feared that he was likely to abscond during the night. He was directed to inform his father at once and to warn him to take immediate steps to ensure his nephew’s presence in the morning as arranged. At 3-30 p.m. Sheikh Esa himself came over aeain from Muharrug, accom panied by a Dhow full of armed followers. He came straight to the Agency and informed me that Sheikh Ali evidently intended to abscond, if he had not already done so, and that he had therefore brought some armed men for the purpose of arresting him, but that to this end he would be glad of the moral support of some representative of the British Agency or of a few sepoys from the Agency guard. How far he was now acting in good faith it was difficult to say, neither was there time to ascertain, but it seemed to me that if we now refused to co-operate with him he might afterwards plead that if he had been given the slight assistance asked for he would have been able to comply with this item of the ultimatum. Accordingly it was decided that Captain Prideaux and Lieutenant Gabriel should accompany the Sheikh’s men, with a dozen sepoys from the Infantry Detachment, but that they should remain in the back ground and only give assistance in case it was actually required. At the same time the Senior Naval Officer was asked by signal to co-perate from the harbour and he did so by sending two armed boats to lie off the shore opposite Sheikh All’s house. The Chief’s son, Abdulla, was in charge of the former’s men and it was left to him to enter the house and endeavour to induce Sheikh Ali to give himself up. In the interval Sheikh Esa himself remained in my company at the Agency, and we were now joined by his brother Sheikh Khalid, of Buffa, and his son Sheikh Hamed. It soon transpired, however, that Ali had escaped earlier in the day, im* mediatelyjon receiving Sheikh Abdulla’s message, (or warning ?), and accordingly Sheikh Khalid left shortly afterwards ostensibly furnished with peremptory instructions from the Chief to scour the island during the night in search of his fugitive nephew. It would probably have been possible to have prevented Sheikh All’s escape by putting Bluejackets ashore in the morning and surrounding his house, but that 'would have been a more or less hostile act .which it did not seem that we were justified in taking before the expiry of the 24 hours allowed for compliance with the terms of the ultimatum. 5. This period expired at 9 a.m. the following morning, February £6th, and on that day Sheikh Esa arrived at the Agency half an hour before the time, accompanied by his sons Hamed and Abdulla. He intimated that he had brought with him the 2,000 rupees demanded as compensation for the Persians, and also the draft notification in connection with the application of the right of “ Sukhra (This was subsequently amended and provisionally approved by me and issued in the form shown in Enclosure No. 2). He added that the 50 men whom he had been called upon to furnish as a Bazaar guard would be produced for inspection at any time thatm'glit be appointed. Witb regard, however, to items 1 and 4 of the ultima tum he stated that he had so far been unable to lay hands on any of the 10 men required, and he had obtained no further news of Sheikh Ali as his brother Khalid had not yet returned. He nevertheless expressed his desire to comply with the orders of Government and agreed to assist us in annexing such attachable property as his nephew might hare left behind. A little later Sheikh Khalid returned, but his appearance evidenced no trace of the exhausting effect which his all-nigbt exertions might have been expected to produce on a man of his age. He reported that he had ascertained that Sheikh Ali, with 8 or 10 followers, had escaped to the mainland in the boat of some fishermen which they had commandeered at a village on the eastern extremity of the island, opposite Katr. The Senior Naval Officer, Captain Prideaux, and myself in consultation, now came to the conclusion that even presuming that Sheikh Esa had connived at Sheikh Ali's escape, bis compliance with three of the demands and his agreement to hand over the fugitive’s property made it hardly justifiable for us to proceed to extremities, but it was decided to call upon him forthwith to send his son Hamed on board one of the men-of-war, both as a hostage and as a proof of his own faith. After considerable demur on his own part and that of his son he finally accepted the situation, and Sheikh Hamed was at once sent off in a man-of- war’s boat to H. M. S. on the understanding that if found nece c sary he should be detained there pending receipt of further telegraphic in structions from Government. The Sheikh was also assured on our own part that it was not part of our intention to deport Hamed to Maskat or elsewhere in lieu of Sheikh Ali. 6. Sheikh Hamed having embarked steps where then taken to annex on behalf of Government Sheikh Ali’s house and realisable property, after allowing sufficient time for his zenana to be removed and suitably housed elsewhere with their immediate personal and household necessaries. They were taken charge of by Sheikh Khalid. A detachment of Marines was landed by the Senior Naval Officer to surround the house and keep order during its attachment, and the same course was followed the next day while Sheikh Ali’s effects where being removed. As soon as the house was completely cleared out it was placed in charge of a sepoy guard from the Agency, which will now be conveniently housed there pending the erection of permanent quarters for them. I m &gt;y mention that while co-operating with us in the attachment of the hou-^e Sheikh bsa asked me to take cognizance of the fact that it was not, accord ing to him, Sheikh Ali’s absolute property but was in fact the “ Government House ” of Manama, and part of the ancestral possessions of the Al-khalifa family. I shall discuss this point, however, in a separate communication and merely mention it incidentally here. Two native crafts, pointed out by Sheikh Esa as belonging to his nephew, were burnt where they lay, and the remainder of his property, consisting of per sonal effects and live-stock, were collected at the Agency for distribution and sale in due course. I shall address Government subsequently with regard to the disposal of the proceeds of the effects confiscated, which it was obviously not desirable to keep in Bahrein. 7. On 28th February the Sheikh definitely intimated that Sheikh Ali and the 10 culprits had escaped from Bahrein territory to the mainland and that he was altogether unable to produce them. ^ At the same time he under took to publish notifications proclaiming their banishment and offering a re ward of 10,000 rupees for Sheikh Ali’s arrest and 200 rupees for that of each of the 10 hooligans. Translations of these notices form Enclosures 3 and 4. So far, then, as the actual terms of the ultimatum were concerned, all the measures that were rendered practicable by the circumstances had J^w ^ een taken ; there remained to be considered, however, the case of the Mullah biotheis, Jasim and Ahmed-bin-Mahz i, whose sinister influence in Manama had been brought into marked relief during the recent incidents. During the present proceedings they had been wise enough to abstain, outwardly at all events, from anv special intrigue which would m i se ive warranted the taking of drastic measures against them, but I was quite at onedurin^nif e w P e r a Dt ' COn ; m r der Somerville of Er ' M - who, during some weeks spent here on survey and guard duty, had obtained a quantity of detailed mtormatton and had prepared sketches of important sections oJe^hSies! iiaVebeen m ° St ValuablG had become ^cessaryT View of th f th ^ possession of Sheikh Ali’s person was not e ected, the measures taken can hardly be regarded as completely satisfactory, aiK 011 ^ v b fl - P erlia P s t&gt;e considered that the fact that Sheikh A i has by his flight to the mainland placed himse’f under sentence of complete wvT 111 som f P°; nts of view a convenient denouement than an alternative which would have entailed our watching him and perhaps maintaining him for some years to come. At any rate, the Sheikh of Bahrein seems to me to have been thoroughly brought to his bearings, while loss of life and local upheaval have been obviated. I trust, therefore, that on the whole the Government of India will be satisfied with the measures taken, even if the terms of the ultimatum have not been completely fulfilled. 10. Since the above paragraphs were written the truant Mullah, Sheikh Ahmed, has repented of his precipitate flight and surrendered himself. The delay in is return has been due to the fact that he had already reached the mainland of Katr when his brother’s last message reached him. Sheikh Jasim has accordingly been allowed to disembark from the Sphit x and after interviewin 0, both brothers together in the presence of Captain Prideaux and reading them a very frank homily on the unsatisfactory character of their demeanour in the past and the intention of the Residency and of Government not to tolerate any repetition of it in future, I have allowed them to go their way, after a friendly expression of the hope, and the warning, that they should in future limit their exertions to their recognised sphere and maintain the friendly relations with this Agency which they admit that our forbearance has now inaugurated, 11. Before leaving Bahrein I have given further consideration to the question of Sheikh Mamed’s detention. The conditions of it were explained in paragr^ph^ 5 above. Since then, granting the initial fact, or presumption, that Sheikh Ali was allowed by him to escape, Sheikh Esa has so far shown his desire to act in acc &gt;rd with the wishes of Government by handing over his nephew’s house and property and by issuing the proclamations set forth in the enclosures to this report. There are several questions connected with the immediate future of the administration of government in Bahrein which it will be ne cessary to place before the Government of India, and this I shall proceed to do with as little delay as possible ; meanwhile Sheikh Mamed’s temporary detention on board H. M. S. Sphinx and the other incidents of the last few days will,^ I hope, have imbued him with some sense of his own impotence and the futility of imagining that he and his father can continue with impunity to flout the wishes of the British Government, to whom indeed they owe every thing. I propose, therefore, after consulting Captain Prideaux, to allo w him to return to the shore before I leave Bahrein to-day. 12. Sheikh Esa has just visited me in order to have a final conversation before my departure and was evidently much relieved, and grateful, regarding the permission to Sheikh Mamed to come ashore. I find his attitude altogether changed, and it is now rather that of a naughty child coming repentant before his parents than that of a ruler of some 70,000 souls who two months ago spoke as arrogantly as if he were ready to defy the British Government to any extent. He said that he was now entirely submissive to Government and that he and his children recognised that when it came to difficulties they had no one else to look to. I replied that I hope he would give proof of his assurances in the future and would look upon his Political Agent as his best friend and adviser. Before taking leave he presentend me with the title-deeds of a plot of ground adjoining the Agency compound which I had told him we needed as a site for quarters for the Infantry Guard and had asked him to acquire from the owners for us, but had intimated at the same time that we were prepared to pay any reasonable price for it. In handing over the title-deed he said that he would prefer to make a free gift of it to Government, an offer which, subject to the approval of Government, I accepted with thanks. It is probably worth about 700 rupees.Memorandum of demands made by tlie Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf upon Sheikh Isa bin Alt, Chief of Bahrein, by order of the Government of India. I am desired, first, to remind you of the long continued friendship and support which have been accorded by the British Government to the rulers of Bahrein. 2. I have need to remind you that these favours have also been extended to you personally. Upon the death of your father, Sheikh Ali bin Khalifah, the British Government caused the usurper Muhammad bin Abdulla to be expelled and yourself installed in your father’s place. You have ever since received the support of the British Government. . 3 - In February 1901, you were notified by the Resident that, in accordance with your express wish the British Government recognised your son, Shaikh Hamed, as your successor to the Chieftainship. 4. They further offered you the services of a British Officer to administer with more efficiency the customs of Bahrein. This offer you refused. 5. These are evidences of the friendly and benevolent spirit which has been consistently displayed towards you by the British Government. . You owe &gt; in the main, to them your present position, the means that you enjoy and your continued occupation of the Chieftainship. 6. Notwithstanding these facts, and notwithstanding the assurances which have been given by you, especially on the occasion of the imprisonment in 1873 of a mail agent in the employ of a British Trading Company, when you promised to abide “Inshalla” by the advice of the Political Resident, you have not maintained your friendship towards the British Government and have con ducted yourself in a manner which cannot be permitted to continue. 7. 1 ou have now refused to accept advice which I have repeatedly offered on behalf of the British Government with a view to the amicable settlement of the difficulties which have arisen in connection with the recent assault by sub jects of yours on certain Persians. The final reply given by you, when I last visited you on the 8th December 1904, was to the following effect: “ I have only one answer to give, namely, that I will do nothing in this case except after trial by my own Shariat or Urf Court”. You were then informed why this procedure could not be agreed to, and, though every consideration was shown t° 7 ^, you still remained obdurate, and thus barred the way to a satisfactory conclusion being arrived at. You have also in spite of my owm repeated re presentations and those of the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, Captain 1 iideaux, entirely failed to keep under proper control your nephew, Shaikh Ali who has undoubtedly been identified through his retainers with the present out- rage on Persians, as well as with the recent attack on the German, Mr. Bahnson tor the illegal application of Sukhra, or forced labour, on the employes of the German, Mr. Wonckhaus and for the forcible removal from the British Mail Steamer Kangra of certain baggalas last December for his own work. 8. Matters have now come to a point when the British Government can no ongev consistently with their own dignity and your permanent interests discuss icse nritters with you, and I am, therefore, instruoted to make the followino* demands upon you : — ° (I) I am to demand that six of the ring-leaders in the attack against Persian su1) jects shall, after identification, be expelled from the island, and with them the 4 persons whom you expelled in connection with the German case, but who 1 learn have returned. (H) I am to demand that Rs. 2,000 shall be paid as compensation to the Persians through the Assistant Political Agent, on account of the outrage committed on them. (Ill) I am to demand that you shall station a special guard of your own Bazaar ^ ° n ^ in Mauania to order in the JJk7 (TV) I a^m to demand that Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed shall leave Bahrein forthwith, and that he shall not be permitted to return there for period of five years counting from the date on which he now leaves Bahrein. (V) I am to demand that the existing: system of “Shukra” or forced labour shall be stringently prohibited as far as employes of foreigners are concerned, and that a public notification to that enect shall be issued in terms to be approved by me. (VI) Finally, I am to warn you that further rejection of advice in im portant matters will not be tolerated by Government, and that in the event of any continuance or repetition of an unfriendly attitude on your part, all support and assistance, whether diplomatic or military, which you and your predecessors have enjoyed, will be withdrawn from yon and may possibly take another direction. It is impossible for the British Government to continue their support and protection to a Chief who continues obdurate to all reasonable advice for his welfare, and assumes an unfriendly attitude towards their officers. These are the demands of which Government has instructed me to exact compliance. It will be necessary for you to comply with them by 9 a.m. to-morrow in the following manner (1) Firstly, you will yourself meet meat 9 a.m. at the Agency, bringing with you one of the copies of these terms signed and sealed by yourself as a proof that you have accepted the said terms. (2) Secondly, you will bring with you at the same time a sum of Rs. 2,000 contained in two bags of Rs. 1,000 each. (3) Thirdly, the following 10 individuals, namely:—(1) Hassan Baluch, (2) Mahomed Tahir, (3^ Zaeed bin Saad, (4) Zaeedbin Ferhan, (5) Bakhit el Nubi, (6) Mar zoo k bin Ismail, (7) Saad Kahtani, (8) Almas, (9) Miyelli, (10) Baraitch bin Zaeed are to be sent by you at the same hour to the Agency. They will proceed straight from the Agency on to one of the men-of-war which will convey them to Maskat where they will he detained for a certain time, their maintenance expenses while at Maskat being paid by yourself. (4) Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed who, by the orders of Government, will be exiled from Bahrein for a period of five years, will also present himself at 9 a.m. at the Agency with two or three private servants who will accompany him; he will likewise proceed forthwith on to one of the men-of-war for conveyance to Maskat, where he will remain pending issue of orders or permission by Governmant for his departure to another place. (5) It will be necessary for you to publish a notice with regard to Sukhra ” and to bring with you a draft of it for inspection and approval by me before promulgation. (6) Yf u must appoint 50 men from among your own reliable followers for the guarding of the Manama Bazaar to be under the orders of Ihe Bazaar Master, and Captain Prideaux, British Agent, will be at liberty to call upon the Bazaar Master to muster the men before him at such times as he may desire, in order that he may verify their numbers. All the above conditions must be fulfilled by you by 9 a.m. on 26th Feb ruary, and after the expiry of the time now given no further law will be allowed you. Accordingly, in order that you may have due warning one hour before the expiry of the time, that is to say, at 8 a.m., each of the three men-of-war will fire one blank charge, so that you may know that there is only one more hour left of the time allowed to you for compliance. In addition to this, a man-of-war’s boat wfill remain on duty off the Mubarrug Customs House in order to bring me any communication from you in the above connection, and this boat will stay there until the last moment possible.8 As soon as the hour of 9 o’clock hns passed, the boat will return to its man-of-war, and after that no further opportunity for communication will exist. The above demands were presented and thoroughly explained by me to Sheikh Isa bin Ali this day, 25th February 1905, in the presence of Captain J. B. Eustace, R.N., Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, and Captain F. B. Prideaux, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein. P. Z. COX, Major, Offg- Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Paled Bahrein, 2oth February 1905. (Enclosure No. 2.) (Translation.) NOTIFICATION. To all whom it may concern be it known that “ Sukhra ” or forced labour is not applicable in any way whatever to the employes or coolies of merchants who are foreign subjects. Any person in authority who applies the custom to any such persons as those specified will be held responsible and will be severely punished. (Signed and sealed.) ESA BIN ALI BIN KHALIFAH, Chief of Bahrein. Bahrein; 22nd Zilhijjeh 1322 A. H. (Enclosure No. 3.) (Translation.) NOTIFICATION. To all whom it may concern. Whereas Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed bin Khalifah has rebelled against the orders of myself, his uncle, Sheikh Esa bin‘Ali, Chief of Bahrein, and has set at nought the commands of the great British Government conveyed to him through the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and myself, and'whereas he has absconded from ^ Bahrein territory, it is accordingly proclaimed to all that the said Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed is hereby placed under ban of expulsion from Bahrein and will be treated as an outlaw. I further give notice that to any person who shall arrest the said Shaikh Ali bin Ahmed and shall deliver his person to me or to any Political Officer of the British Government in the Persian Gulf or to the Captain of a British man-of- war, I, Esa bin Ali al Khalifah, Chief of Bahrein, will pay him the sum of Rs. 10,000 (ten thousand) only. Dated at Bahrein, this 24th day of Zilhijjeh 1322. (Signed and sealed.) ESA BIN ALI BIN KHALIFAH, Chief of Bahrein. (Enclosure No. 4.) (Translation.) NOTIFICATION. To all whom it may concern. Be it known that the ten persons whose names are mentioned below who have dehed our orders and absconded from Bahrein, are herebv placed under ban of expulsion from my territory of Bahrein altogether, and any person delivering any of the said persons to me or to the British representative in Bahrein, he will be entitled to a reward of Rs. 200 (two hundred) only.[Confidential^ No. 128, dated Bushire, the 11th (received 20 th) March 1905. From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of a report forwarded under this office No. 119, dated 4th instant, I have the honour to submit, for consideration, certain problems con nected with the administration of government in Bahrein in the immediate future. 2. My previous communication will probably be considered to demonstrate that Sheikh Esa, for the time being at any rate, has been brought to a sense of his obligations so far as his attitude towards the Government of India is concerned, and that he appears personally anxious to encourage in us the belief that he now realises that he connot live in complete prosperity unless he is in accord with His Excellency’s Government. This is no doubt satisfactory so far as it goes, but it is a consideration quite apart from the question of the Sheikh’s fitness as a Ruler. In paragraphs 19 and 20 of my report No. 421, dated 17th December, I recorded sufficiently plainly, my impressions of Sheikh Esa in this role and of his son Sheikh Hamed as his successor-designate in the government, and the incidents of the last fortnight have certainly given me no cause to alter my views. The report of proceedings indeed shows that even if he had the mind the Sheikh apparently had not the power, to deliver up a single one of the ten common roughs whose expulsion was demanded, nor even sufficient resolution to make any serious attempt to prevent their escaping from Bahrein. This surely is convincing proof of the infirmity of his government. 3. Under the circumstances I venture to express the opinion that on public grounds it cannot he regarded otherwise than as a matter for considerable regret that the exigencies of imperial politics do not admit of our making our moral protectorate over Bahrein into an open and effective one at the present juncture. Certain it is that we are extremely unlikely, in the present genera tion, to be provided with such manifest and cogent grounds for so doing as we now have. On the other hand by applying the sponge, as it were, and giving the present regime a new lease of life, especially at a time when we are witnessing a gradual increase in the European community in Manama for whom we practically accept, before foreign powers, as much responsibility as if we had a complete protectorate, we shall largely increase our administrative risks and difficulties. In fact I do not see what we can reasonably expect except periodical trouble, from a continuation of our laudable endeavours to carry on the government of the island through the rule of a chief who has shown himself to possess few if any of the qualifications necessary for the maintenance of order and the security of the person and of trade in a flourishing sea port like Manama. 4. If I may be pardoned for a few moment’s digression at this point, I would observe that I am not by any means the first political officer, from Colonel Sir Lewis Belly downwards, upon whom the vision has impressed itself of a suitable tract of territory in our effective occupation which would form a convenient centre of British influence in these waters ; and, following this line of thought, a Bahrein under British rule, with the improved pier and harbour accommodation, which I believe it to be capable of providing under expert exploitation, offers to my mind considerable possibilities. This is no doubt too visionary and remote a contingency for lively consideration at the present time, nevertheless it can hardly be gainsaid that the activity of Belgian Customs Officials and the efforts of representatives of foreign powers in keen competition with us, display a common tendency to assail our privileged position in many small matters and a natural desire to2 us from the commercial and political pre-eminence which we have so WpoSjsed to the general level in which they themselves now move. ^ If this view is correct it may then conceivably become essential for us at some futoe time! not necessarily very remote, to devise fresh means of meeting competition and of acquiring freer scope for our action in these regions. It is for this reason that I venture to suggest that the British Government cannot afford to exclude altogether from their field of vision, the picture which I have adumbrated in connection with Bahrein. 5. I now beg to revert to the questions for immediate consideration. The Sheikh has indeed in accordance with the terms of the ultimatum, nrovided 50 men, probably the best or as good as he can muster, to act as police m Manama, but the Government of India must be aware what unreliable people these askaris are and I fear we can set little store by them. Then again the fact of Sheikh Ali having outlawed himself makes it the more necessary that the measures for the mafntenance of order in Manama and its protection against attack, should be fairly effective for some time to come. I see no reason to suppose that Sheikh Ali will be able to rouse any serious hostility from the mainland against Bahrein in the near future, but it is quite possible that he may join the ranks of Nasir Mubarak and AkmcA bin Salman and try his hand at piracy during the coming date season, and both Capt &gt;m Prideaux and I are of opinion that Sheikh Bsa has proved himself too wea and infirm a ruler for it to be expedient on public grounds that the maintenance of order and security should be left entirely in his irresolute hands. 6 Asa half measure short of the extreme step of setting aside Sheikh lisa, some such course as the following might be found compatible with the views ot His Majesty’s Government. That we should inform Sheikh Esa that recent events have brought it clearly home to the Government of India that the security of trade and the lives of Europeans, for whose safety the British Government is morally respon sible, can no longer be safely left in the hands of a Chief whose Government has shewn itself to be so weak and ineffective that he has been unable, to prevent rowdiism in the town; to arrest known offenders ; to keep them out when once expelled by his order ; or to prevent their escape when their arrest has been desired. At the same time they see with regret that the son, whom out of friendly consideration for the Sheikh they had gone to the unusual course ot publicly recognising as his successor, is possessed of no adequate ideas ol the seriousness or responsibilities of his position. Such being the case the Govern ment of India while deciding out of regard for his grey hairs and his professions of loyalty not to subject Sheikh Esa to the indignity of being set aside, cannot nevertheless allow the Government of Manama to remain longer under his unaided control or want of control, and therefore propose to make the following arrangements with which he is expected to acquiesce. (a) that he himself will continue to reside and rule in Muharrug but ' will not actively participate in the government of Manama, which will be carried on by an approved Vazier selected for him by the Government of India on a fixed salary, (300^ to 500 per month would I think be sufficient), under the immediate guidance of the Political Agent. lb) that in order to assist them in keeping order a small force of police will be either imported or locally enlisted and trained, and placed under a subordinate Native Police officer of the Gov ernment of India. Their numbers will be regulated according to the duties found to be required of them and will probably not amount to more than 50. Botb tbe pay and bousing of tbe Yazier and Police will be paid for by tbe Sbeikb through the Political Agent. Botb Captain Prideaux and I are of opinion that some arrangement on these lines is very much to be desired. As a further precautionary measure I would also recommend the early provision of a steam pinnace, or adapted torpedo-boat for use at Bahrein, as has been recently suggested [vide this office letter No. 96, dated 18th Eebruary 1905). Had sucha Vessel as the latter been available during the recent operations, it would probably have been possible to blockade the Island and prevent Sheikh All’s escape to the mainland. 7. There remains to be considered the question of a successor to Sheikh Esa. The latter though getting on in years is, I believe, endowed with good health and there is no reason to expect his early demise. At the same time his son Sheikh Hamed seems to be the least desirable of his sons in character, and to be shaping in a way which gives grounds for the presumption that he is likely to prove no more satisfactory as a ruler than his father. In this connection I understand Captain Prideaux to incline to the opinion that we should withdraw our recognition from him altogether and notify the fact now. In that case he would suggest the selection of Sheikh Esa’s grandson Khalifa (the youth mentioned in paragraph 2 of my report No. 119) whom Captain Prideaux thinks well of, and who gives me also the impression of being a nice-natured boy. Sheikh Esa too is evidently much attached to him. In the event of his selection the idea would be to prevail upon the Sheikh to let him go to India to acquire some degree of education, with which he would be better equipped for the part he might subsequently be called upon to play. To tell Hamed now, however, that he was debarred from all chance of succeeding his father would, I fear, introduce a permanent element of strife and unrest into Sheikh Esa’s family, the obviation of which was our main object in specifically recognising one of his sons as his successor, and after giving the question full consideration from all points of view, I am inclined to recommend that we content ourselves for the present with informing Sheikh Esa that the Government of India are by no means pleased with the way in which his son and presumptive successor has comported himself during the recent incidents, and that while loth to withdraw recognition once given without very strong and specific grounds they feel called upon to warn Sheikh H amed plainly that their ultimate acquiescence in his succession will depend entirely on his satisfactory demeanour from this day forward. In the meanwhile the Political Agent might be authorised to use his influence with Sheikh Esa in order to prevail upon him to allow Khalifa, now 14 or 15 years of age, to go to India for a time for education and training. In this way, should anything happen to Sheikh Hamed or should his future demeanour oblige us to withdraw our recognition from him, another and more satisfactory candidate would be ready to hand. 8. Referring to the proposal to appoint a Vazier put forward in paragraph 6 supra, it may be as well if I at once suggest some one for the appointment, in case the idea commends itself to Government. What I think is wanted is not an official brought up too strictly on Indian lines but one familiar with the customs and weaknesses as well as with the language of the community in which his work will lie. It occurs to me that Seyyid Mahomed-bin-Saeed, son of the late Vazier of the Sultan of Muscat, might fulfil requirements, and that it would at any rate be worth while giving him a trial if the proposal is approved. His father Seyyid Saeed was of great help to me at Muscat up to the time of his death and the son, though not such a capable man and handicapped by an increased admixture of negro blood, always did his best to follow in his father’s footsteps and maintain close relations with the British A gency. When I handed over my duties at Muscat to Major Grey, Seyyid Mahomed-bin-Saeed was one of those whom I especially commended to his good offices, and it is evident that my successor has also formed a good opinion of him for recently, at the latter’s suggestion, I had the pleasure of sending Seyyid Mahomed a gold watch in recognition of the good work done by him in helping to trace the Maseera murderers. He is, therefore, a man who deserves well of the British Government and ' on the other hand has little to look forward to except through our good offices, for according to my experience Seyyid Feisal does not bear him any personal liking. He is able to read and write with facility and is, I firmly believe, quite loyal to us and to our interests.4 These qualifications seem to be almost all that would be required m the first instance. # # Once installed at Bahrein the Vazier would shape his attitude on lines laid down for him by the Political Agent. The only primary disqualification which Seyyid Mahomed has is that he knows yery little, if any, Hindustani, and as it would be obviously important that he should be able to hold direct converse with his Chief, it will he equally important conversely that our representative at Bahrein shall know Arabic colloquially or he required to pass an examination in it within a given time after arrival. In fact this is very necessrary m any case. 9. It was partly on the chance of Government signifying approval to the appointment of a Vazier to govern Manama, that I decided in consultation with Captain Prideaux not to let the house lately occupied by Shaikh Ali-bin-Ahmed jeave our possession until I had had an opportunity of referring the question ^o Government. It will he remembered that I stated in my last report (paragraph 6) that Sheikh Esa was anxious to impress upon me that this building had always been known as the &lt;£ Government House ” of Manama, and belonged to the A1 Khalifa family and not to Sheikh Ali. I informed him that I did not feel in a position to give any decision either about ^ the house or any other part of Sheikh Ali’s property without first obtaining the instructions of Government) and that in the meanwhile some of our own guard who had not yet been provided with quarters might conveniently be housed in it. To this he made no objection. I shall be glad of instructions in this regard.^ Though Sheikh Esa is apparently correct in claiming that the house itself is family property, the fact remains that he never was and never would have been able to eject Sheikh Ali from it. Consequently if the proposal to appoint a Vazier is approved, or if in the near future Sheikh Esa gives the management of the Bahrein Customs into our hands, the use of these premises which are close to the Customs House and landing wharf will be most important to-us. I, therefore, recommend that we inform Sheikh Esa that whereas we are prepared, subject to further inquiry, to agree that the remainder of Sheikh Ali’s landed property in the Islands, of which the Political Agent has a list, shall for the time being remain in his custody, we propose to ^ retain Sheikh Ali’s late residence in Manama in our hands for the present, as it is not consi dered desirable that it should be occupied by any of the Khalifa family for some time to come.

This is in harmony with what Captain Pndeaux suggested in paragraph 9 of his letter: No. 104, dated 31st March 1905, and was conveyed to the Sheikh by the Assistant Political Agent in paragraph 3 of his No. 120, dated nth April, and subject to any instructions which Government may be pleased to communicate has my approval. J . t 3 * Tf* 6 Persians at Bahrein are a timid community at the best of times, and just now are naturally inclined to exaggerate current rumours, but in any case it was only to be expected that until matters had had time to settle down, an occa- sional scare should arise. His Majesty’s ship Redbreast, which had been on guard duty since the operations, had to leave recently for a few days to meet the Admiral, but the latter informs me that he is sending the Lapwing to replace her ; and judging from the tone of Sheikh Ah s communication contained in the enclosures it does not appear probaole that he would be inclined to make trouble now even if he had the following to enable him to do so. With regard to the treatment to be accorded to Sheikh AH, if he surrenders, I concur with the views expressed by Captain Prideaux in the concluding sentence of his letter No. 104, dated 31st March 1905.

Prideaux, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. r correspondence on the subject of the misconduct of Sheikh Ah bin Ahmed A 1 Khalifa, I have the honour to report that on Satur day last, the 25th instant, the Chief of Bahrein with all his three sons went out ostensibly for shikar and change of air to a place a few miles south of Rufaa in the desert about 11 or 12 miles distant from the town of Manama. ^ 2 G Cn 0 f the 28th instant Ha P AbduI Nab h the Persian merchant and Haji Abdalla, the interpreter of His Majesty’s ship Redbreast came to me with two young Persian peddlars, who declared that they had both that day been touring independently amongst the villages in the north-west quarter of the island with the town of Budeya as their ultimate objective. The one was sud denly met by three negroes, armed with swords, who used threatening gestures towards him and insisted upon his immediately turning round, saying that he would be killed if he came any further west. The other peddlar was told by a Bahreini Shiah of the village Beni Jamra that he had just come from Budeya and had learnt that Sheikh Ah bin Ahmed had recently landed there with a large escort of Bedouin that he was not certain whether Sheikh Ali was still in Budeya or had proceeded to Rufaa, but he belived that he had undoubtedly come to wreak vengeance upon the Persians as the authors of his troubles and he therefore begged his co-religionists to hurry back to Manama to warn the leaders of the Persian community to protect themselves. At the same time the Gazetteer Ci 19FD A2 surveyor told me that he had that day met a party on the road between Manama and Rufaa, escorting a lady who was, so his coolies told him, the Manama wife of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed. n. On the morning of the 29th l sent my two Munshis, Ilaji Abbas and Abdul Rasul, out respectively to Budeya and Rufaa to endeavour to get reliable information. Before their return 1 was visited, first, by the religious leader of the Hindu community, a man who has spent 50 years of his life here who said that Manama town was full of Bedouin and that the Bunmahs w-ere apprehensive of trouble, and, secondly, by Mr. Bahnson of the German firm who said that his employes and clients were also commenting on the same fact. Commander Somerville, R.N., and 1 accordingly went into the Bazaar and walked through all the principal streets, with the result that though we found a large number ^ of foreign Arabs in it, we came to the conclusion that no danger was to be antici pated from them as they were not armed and looked more like beggars than anything else. Both my Munshis returned, having seen or heard nothing alarming, and Haji Abbas remarked that the advent of some 200 or 300 beggars from Neid at this season is an annual occurrence, they coming as soon as possible after the icth day of Mohurram to collect “ zikat ” or charitable con tributions for the year from all the wealthy merchants of the place. The notice taken by the Bunniahs and others this year of this ordinary matter is only one of several incidents showing the uneasiness felt in consequence of recent events. 4. Yesterday Sheikh Isa returned from his camp to Muharrak. I at once wrote him a letter mentioning the rumours that were rife, remarking that he had given me no information whatsoever about Sheikh Ah s movements since his flight 34 days ago, and asking him now to tell me all he knew, not only as to the Sheikh’s present whereabouts, but also about the manner of his flight and his probable future intentions. 5. The Chief promptly wrote back that the rumours about Sheikh Ali*s return to Bahrein were absolutely false and that he was still with the Bedouin in the interior of Katar. He gave no information about the method of the Sheikh’s departure. 6. This morning I have received a letter from the Chief enclosing two received by him from Sheikh Ali, one to his own address and one to mine. Translations are appended. 7. The rumour in the Bazaar to which I attach most credence is that when Sheikh Ali joined Sheikh Ali A 1 Thani and his brother in Katar, he was told that he could not be allowed to stay with them permanently, and accordingly after the lapse of a few days he went on to the Nayim tribe, who are all on the best of terms with Sheikh Isa and whose two head Sheikhs draw regular salaries from the Bahrein revenues. 8. It is possible that Ali has not come to Bahrein, but considering the points mentioned in this letter, coupled with the fact that on the afternoon of the 28th instant I was visited by the two leading merchants of Bahrein, who in the course of conversation on various subjects asked me if I would care for their assistance in getting Sheikh Ali to surrender, and the rapidity with which to-day’s proposition has followed on the Chief’s return, I cannot help personally thinking that the report of Sheikh Ali’s return, temporary or otherwise, is correct. I am making further efforts to arrive at the truth, and hope for the Chief’s sake that the rumour is false. 9. With regard to Sheikh Ali’s petition to me it seems very desirable that he should be given an early answer. Unless therefore I receive your orders to the contrary by the next mail l shall reply that “ the justice of the British Government is well known to all. Sheikh Ali has added to his other faults by disobeying the last summons of his uncle to his presence. It is believed also that he has taken with him the ten persons whose surrender is required by Government. The wisest thing that Sheikh Ali can do is to surrender himself to a British man-of-war as quickly as possible. This is the only reply that can be made to him.”In this connection I would observe that Sheikh AH appears to affect to think that his offences- were fully atoned for by his departure on a three weeks’ sporting excursion to Katar. I do not think that any show of leniency is at all desirable in his case, and recommend that when he has surrendered he should now be compelled to reside at some quiet place in the interior of India for at least 5 years, where it may be hoped that he will be favourably affected by the civilizing nature of our rule. Translation of a letter, dated 24th Moharram 1323 (31st March 1905), from Sheikh Isa bin Ali ) Chief of Bahrein^ to Captain Prideaux, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, After compliments .—I beg to inform you that I received to-day two letters from Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed, one to your address and the other to mine, both of which I send you herewith. The perusal of them by you will suffice. I shall not reply to Sheikh Ali until I hear your decision on his case. Translation of a petition, dated ijth Moharram 1323 (24th March 1905), address not given, from Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed, to Captain Prideaux, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein. I beg to inform you that when I left Bahrein l was not in my proper senses. My name has been deeply disgraced in the eyes of the tribes. I did not know that I was considered at fault or that my fault was so great as to necessitate my expulsion from my country and the spoiling of my house and property. The decision arrived at regarding me by yourself and my father Sheikh Isa on the was submitted to by me and I behaved properly. I knew nothing until I was suddenly informed that I was to be arrested and deported to another land. I was much alarmed at the news and fled away. I now humbly solicit the Government through you for justice, for the impartiality of which it is renowned all over the world. Let my condition be taken into consideration, so that I be not exiled from my country and family. I will henceforth remain submissive to the Government. If there has been any unknown fault of mine in the past I beg for the forgiveness of the Government to the same. I now promise that so long as I live I shall abide by the will of the Government in all matters. This is my petition. The decision is in your hands. Translation of a petition, dated ijth Moharram 1323 (March 1903), address not given, from Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed to Sheikh Isa bin Ali, Chief of Bahrein. I, your son, have been your loyal subject and I have committed no fault. When I saw the paper containing the decision come to about me between your self and the Political Resident dated the &gt; 1 left Bahrein on the seventh day after the departure of Major Cox together with 21 of my men and remained away for 21 days. I obeyed the orders of yourself and the Political Resident, which were to the effect that if no orders were received from the Gov ernment of India about me within 21 days I was at liberty to return to Bahrein. No orders came and I accordingly returned to Bahrein. I behaved properly and 1 did not know that I was considered at fault or that that fault was so great as to necessitate my being sent away from my country, my house to be spoilt and my moveable property to be confiscated and burnt. I knew nothing until i was suddenly informed that I was to be arrested and deported to another land. I was much alarmed at this news and fled away. I now beg that you will kindly move the Government of India to pardon my fault which was hidden from me, and I have no doubt that they will forgive me as they have done in the case of many others. 1 am sure that they do not wish to see me always exiled from my family and country, for they pardon greater faults than mine. I hope you will kindly write to the Government for warding this letter and ask them to pardon me, and they doubtless will pardon me. Being in the position of a son to you, I write this petition to you.I 4 No. 112, dated Bahrein, the 31st March 1905. F rom Captain F. B.

In addition to the warning thus given, I spoke verbally to Sheikh Ali’s brother-in-law, Sheikh Abdullah bin Isa, on the same subject on the 28th January 1905, asking him whether Sheikh Ali had made his preparations for departure as he undoubtedly would be obliged to go for a considerable period.

The full purport of these letters was posted by me to Bushire on the day following their receipt from you, but I have since learnt that the Political ^Resident had not returned there when the last mail steamer left Bushire and it has not therefore been possible for me to hear from him on the subject. * 3. My personal view on the matter is that the wisest thing that Sheikh Al can do is to surrender himself to you or to the nearest British man-of-war as quickly as possible. The justice of the British Government is well known to every one. Sheikh Ah has added^ to his earlier faults by disobeying your final summons to your presence. It is also believed that he has taken away with him the other ten■ Ml persons whose surrender is required by Government. I cannot therefore believe that the Government will pardon Sheikh Ah before he has done atonement for his faults, but the punishments inflicted by the Government are never unduly harsh* You must remember that until Sheikh Ali is brought in your reputation lor good faith is always under a cloud, and if ‘he N’ayim tube are as to you Is they are claimed to be it should not be a difficult matter to effect Sheikh Ah s capture in Katar. 4. You have not noticed the request the I made in 'my letter No. 97, dated . 23rd Muharratn 1323 for details of the flight of Sheikh All from Bahrein and ms subseq h uent h 'movements, and I shall be glad to hear from you on this subject for the information of the Government of India. It is understood that persons, who assisted Sheikh Ali before he was declared an out aw or who can prove that they have harboured him subsequently in ignorance of this fact, will not be con- sidered subject to blame. 6 th ^afar 1323 Dated Bahrein, the , a th April ijos* From— Sheikh Isa bin Ali, Al Khalifa, Chief of Bahrein, To—C aptain, F. B. Prideaux, Political Agent, Bahrein. After compliments .— I received your two letters of yesterday’s date. I am very thankful to you for having forwarded to the Resident Sheikh Ah bin Ahmed’s letters which the Resident has not yet seen on account of his being away. In your opinion Sheikh Ali should either surrender himself to me or to a man-of-war as soon as possible because the British justice is known to every one. All that you say is quite correct. The N’ayim tribesmen cannot capture Sheikh Ali. I think that since Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed has petitioned the Government to pardon him, he must be anxiously waiting for a reply. He will not do any mis chief now. On being reminded by you about the information which you had asked me in your letter No. 97, dated &gt; regarding Sheikh Ali’s flight, I looked up the reply I had given you and find that I have not been negligent on this point. I sent you enclosed copies of letters that passed between you and me about Sheikh Ali. Probably through an oversight something was omitted in my reply in original. I cannot understand one passage of your letter, in which you state that persons who assisted Sheikh Ali before and after he was declared an outlaw will not be subject to blame. 1 beg therefore to excuse my asking you for a reply to the same.

COX, c.i.e., POLITICAL RESIDENT in the PERSIAN GULF. Dated Simla, the 17th May 1905, Sir, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 123, dated the 11 th March 1905, regarding the affairs of Bahrein, and your proposals for improving the administration of the island. &lt; 2 . The Government of India are prepared to accept your view that Sheikh Esa, although he has been brought to a sense of his obligations towards the Government of India by the recent demonstration of his powerlessness to maintain a recalcitrant attitude in the face of their displeasure, is, at the same time, so lacking in vigour and natural qualifications as to make it unlikely that he will ever discharge adequately his duties as Ruler of an island possessing the possibilities of development presented by Bahrein. From this consideration you have been tempted to express the opinion that it is a matter for regret that the exigencies of Imperial politics do not admit of our making our moral protectorate over the island into an open and effective one, and you have proceeded to adumbrate the picture of Bahrein under British rule as a convenient centre of British influence in these waters. The even tualities you have sketched are, in your own words, visionary and remote, and their relevancy is not apparent in any discussion of the problems connected with the government of Bahrein in the immediate future. With regard to this portion of your letter therefore, I am to say that it would he superfluous to discuss, or even to contemplate, a contingency calling for any measures so distasteful to the views of His Majesty’s Government, and so foreign to the policy which they are pursuing in the Persian Gulf. 3. Turning now to the actual situation, as it presents itself in Bahrein, the Government of India cannot but share the disappointment which you must experience that the immediate results of the ultimatum are hardly what might have been expected, so far as the improvement in the administration of the island is concerned. For this state of affairs, it is admitted, the deficiencies of the Chief himself are to blame, and as the remedy of setting aside Sheikh Esa is one which they see no present expediency in contemplating, the Govern ment of India concur with you in holding that the effect of the recent demonstration must not be sacrificed, and that the Sheikh ought to be required, and required at once, to introduce such reforms into his administra tion as are held to be necessary. At the same time it is necessary to bear in mind that our new proposals must be both so framed and so presented to the Chief as to obviate the necessity for another intervention and further threatened bombardment; and, in order to effect this end, it appears to the Government of India that the influence which they should now be able to exercise through2 their Political Agent—if the latter establishes a proper position with the Sheikh ought to suffice without the necessity for tendering advice in the formal manner which you seem to contemplate. 4 . A few months only have elapsed since His Majesty’s Secretary of State approved the appointment to Bahrein of an officer of the graded list of the Political Department. The objects of this measure were explained in the despatch from the Government of India, dated the 21st of April 1904, and foremost among them was that of securing moral influence over the Sheikh. Since Captain Prideaux landed at Manama, events have occurred which have afforded a unique opportunity of furthering this end. The account of the recent outrages has been settled, and that in a manner which has no doubt rendered the Sheikh sincerely desirous of avoiding a repetition of similar incidents, and which has presumably impressed on the unruly element among his subjects the need for greater circumspection in the future. The Sheikh has inaugurated a special corps of police, and the vigilance of the Political Agent should ensure its efficiency. Backed by the moral force of the newly posted British guard, or in case of need by its active assistance, this body may reasonably be expected to suffice for the maintenance of an improved state of order. At the present moment, therefore, your advice and that of the Political Agent should possess peculiar weight, and might be expected to suffice, unaided, to induce all requisite reforms. 5. The measures which you propose for the acquiescence of the Sheikh are: — {a) The appointment of a Wazir selected for him by the Government of India to carry on the government of Manama under the immediate guidance of the Political Agent. (b) The creation of a small police force under a native police officer of the Government of India. (&lt;?) The warning of the present Ruler’s heir, Sheikh Hamed, that in spite of the recognition given by the Government of India to his right to succeed, their ultimate acquiescence in his succession will depend entirely on his satis factory demeanour from this day forward. (d) The exercise by the Political Agent of his influence with Sheikh Esa in order to prevail upon him to allow his grandson, Khalifa, to be sent to India for a time for education and training in view of the possibility of his eventual selection to succeed in place of Sheikh Hamed. 6 . With regard to (&lt;r) and (d), I am to approve your proposals, and the Political Agent should take a suitable opportunity to make the necessary communications both to Sheikh Esa and Sheikh Hamed. Your proposal ( 6 ) is not one on which any orders are required until a decision has been arrived at about your first and more important suggestion that the Sheikh should hand over the administration to a Wazir appointed by the Government of India. Such a reform, if practicable, would doubtless have the most far-reaching results on the government of Bahrein, but before they can be in a position to pass orders upon the proposal, the Government of India would like to receive further information both as to its probable effect upon the Chief, and as to your reasons for omitting from your present scheme—an omission which has been observed with some surprise—all mention of Customs reform, the principal object, which for so many years past they have urged upon Sheikh Esa. 7. The need for a revision of the Bahrein Customs system has long been regarded as pressing. During his tour in the Gulf in 1903, His Excellency the Viceroy personally intimated to the Sheikh that the matter was one which could not be permitted to drop, and the despatch in which the Government of India recently sought the sanction of His Majesty’s Government to a reconstitution of the Bahrein Agency, indicated in the clearest manner that this question was the first to which the newly-appointed representative should address himself. But your letter is silent on the subject. It hardly appears consistent with their dignity that the British Government should now abandon, m the hour of success, that upon which they have throughout insisted as the first condition of reform. Moreover, any improvement in administration—theVt? ) I tlie Hal of tof in H ikh. a?e tlie ubt ilar ikh ical wly nay fate the ito :ikh tof .nee rof led, tis- Esa idia ,ual the appointment of a competent Wazir, or the maintenance of an efficient police— must lead to additional expense, and must render fiscal reform the more press- mg. Under sound guidance the chosen Wazir might doubtless introduce an improved Customs regime, but it hardly seems reasonable to suppose that the Chiet would accept our nominee to superintend his entire administration more readily than he would, receive our candidate to supervise a single department. 1 he Customs question is a test case, and, as at present advised, the Government °u 11 l a cons i^ er that it is one on which all available means of suasion should be concentrated. 8 . In view of the foregoing remarks I am to request that you will furnish a further report, explaining in what relation to each other stand, in your opmion, the Customs question and the appointment of a Wazir, and further elucidating, what is not clear from your present communication, the manner m which the Sheikh may be expected to regard the different proposals for reform, how far he may be counted on to acquiesce in their execution, how far he is likely to prove amenable to the authoritative advice and influence of his Political Agent, and in what manner you would propose to applv pressure, should this be required. rr j r 9.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Foreign Department letter No. 1873-E. B., dated 17th May, regarding Bahrein affairs, and to submit the further report called for in paragraph 8 thereof. 2. Before dealing with the questions of reform under consideration, I beg to offer some explanations regarding one or two points which have_ given Govern ment cause for remark, in the hope of removing misunderstanding if any exists. I regret in the first place that the digression in paragraph 4 of my letter of 1 ith March as to the possibilities of Bahrein as a centre of jkitish influence in * We did not say so. Persian Gulf should have appeared C[urzon]. strikingly * irrelevent. With reference to the paragraphs preceding it, I would explain that while I knew there were considered to be objections to the modification of our attitude in regard to Bahrein, on the score of temporary political expediency, I did not realise that the suggested con version of a partial into an effective protectorate over the islands was in itself distasteful to His Majesty’s Government, and foreign to the policy which they are pursuing in the Persian Gulf. It was rather in my mind when I wrote that since I have been at Bushire, His Majesty’s Prime Minister in a public speech circulated to the world by Reuter, referred to Bahrein as being virtually a British Protectorate or words to * No. 402 in Secret e., March 1905, Nos. 369 — ■ that effect, and also that on ■ f’ 21 st January 422. ] as t the Government of India expressed the opinion to the Secretary of State that the present opportunity seemed par ticularly favourable for proclaiming our Protectorate. I learn too from my record, that a little later, on 22nd February 1905 His Majesty’s Minister for Foreign Affairs intimated to the Turkish Ambassador that it was a matter of common knowledge that “ the island (of Bahrein) and its natives are under British Protection ”; and on the same page of the record I read that His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople informed the Sublime Porte categorically on 12th August 1835 that all Turkish claims to Bahrein “ which is under the protection of the Queen of England ” were totally inadmis sible. I now realise that at the time of addressing the Government of India on nth March I did not adequately appreciate the width of the Gulf which diplo macy places between the interpretation of the expression “ under the protection of ” and “ under the protectorate of 3. Referring now to the question of the Bahrein Customs I have to regret too that my express reason for omitting mention of it, was not apparent to the Government of India as I thought it would be. I beg to explain it. In doing so I would first invite reference to the two telegrams marginally Foreign Department No. 85-E. b. ; dated 6th noted. In the latter I expressed the nos. 391 January 190$. opinion or the hope that even if the seiz- 1905,No. 36g-42», Resident’s reply dated-^oth Ure of the Customs did not constitute January 1905. p ar t 0 f his punishment, the thorough bring ing of Sheikh Esa to his bearings would cause him to accept his Political Agent’s advice regarding to Customs when next it was offered, after a convenient inter val of time. Subsequently in the telegram which was repeated to me under Foreign Department No. 744-E. B., dated 18th February, the Secretary of State for India observed— ” If is not considered expedient by His Majesty’s Government to sanction the measure which you proprose in connection with the occupation See Nos. 416 and 41 7 inSecret E., March 1905, of the Custom House ; for Nos. 369.422. this reason that the connec tion of Sheikh Ali’s lawlessness and his uncle’s inability to control 46him, with the Custms difficulties, is so remote. Suspicions injuri ous to our other interests in the Persian Gulf might be aroused thereby 4. I would next refer to paragraph 6 of my letter No. 123 of 11th March. This was written immediately on conclusion of operations at Bahrein. I had doubts as to whether Government would consider that the measures taken were completed and sufficient, and had told Sheikh Esa so. My opinion that Sheikh Esa was hopeless as a Ruler had been strengthened, and 1 suggested to Govern ment that we should strike while the iron was hot and should inform Sheikh Esa that we “ propose to make the following arrangements in which he is expected to acquiesce.” The measures thus proposed by me were clearly put forward as a comple tion or continuance of the coercion, to be applied, I hoped, almost at once; and I submit that in the face of the Secretary of State’s dictum that the control of the Customs should not be effected in immediate connection with the recent incidents, I could not properly have included a repetition of any proposal in that direction among the reforms which I recommended Government to impose upon Sheikh Esa forthwith. I thought in fact that it was now accepted that we must content ourselves with the hope that the desired changes in this connection would eventually be brought about by the personal influence over the Sheikh which Government’s newly appointed Agent at Bahrein might be expected gradually to acquire. This reform of the Customs through British supervision is a paramount objec tive which neither the Political Agent nor I have for a moment lost sight of or ceased to discuss, but while I am personally hopeful, i cannot say that the latest Bahrein reports give cause for immediate encouragement. Captain Prideaux has his heart thoroughly in his work and is doing his utmost, but he has a task before him which would have been a sufficiently diffi cult one even for a Political Officer possessing exceptional colloquial proficiency in Arabic; and he has further had to contend with initial difficulties which it is necessary that Government should know, and take into account. He has taken up Arabic since his appointment to Bahrein, but naturally cannot yet communicate with the Sheikh except through a third party, and this question of a medium of communication has, from the beginning been a difficult one ; for the worthy old munshi of the Agency, on whom the duty should pro parly fall, besides being a Shiah by religion, is in other respects not a persona grata with the Sheikh. This was fully realised, but suitable men are very diffi cult to get and it was only recently that Captain Prideaux was able to obtain from India the services of a young man of good education and antecedents possessing a good knowledge of Arabic. It will be some little time however before he can become thoroughly versed in the work required of him. Apart from this Captain Prideaux was formerly, as the Government of India may remember, First Assistant in this Residency, and while holding that post, was sent on an important mission to Bahrein by Colonel Meade to remind the Sheikh generally of his obligations and to put pressure on him with regard to several matters of which settlement was badly required. The recollection of his former visit on the above duty was perhaps in the first instance hardly the best recommendation for a new Political Agent to the Sheikh’s confidences. While reiterating therefore that Captain Prideaux is working thoroughly well and doing his utmost to further the policy of Government, I can but expect that some little time must elapse before he can hope to acquire, if indeed it is possible for any one to do so in the case of Sheikh Esa, that position of friendly and imperceptible domination which is the only kind of influence that can be really efficacious in a case of a long standing intractability like the present. 47J 6 . Referring to paragraphs 7 and 8 of Foreign Department letter under reply, it will 1 think now be clear to Government that the proposal regarding a Vazier was made on the supposition that Sheikh Esa would be compelled to accept him, and his appointment was not associated in any way with the question of Customs control ; and I concur with Government in thinking that the Sheikh would be no more likely to accept willingly a nominee of ours as his Vazier than as the Superintendent of his Customs. The difference that the two projects presented to my mind was, that having regard to the views of His Majesty’s Secretary of State in the telegram above quoted, the appointment of an Arab Vazier to keep order in Manamah had more close connection with Sheikh All’s lawlessness and the inability of Sheikh Esa to control him, and lay the disinterest edness of our motives open to less suspicion than did the assumption of British supervision or control over the Bahrein Customs. 7. Before giving a final answer to the three questions (a) How the Sheikh may be expected to regard the different proposals for reform. (b) How far he is likely to prove amenable to the authoritative advice and influence of his Political Agent. (c) In what manner pressure should, if necessary, be applied. I would prefer to visit Bahrein again if possible. Unfortunately at present the port is plague-infected and to go there means 9 days’ quarantine on return. Meanwhile I shall communicate with Captain Prideaux and act on the in structions conveyed to me in paragraphs (5) (d) and {c) and 9. •32, No. 250, dated Bushire, the 4th June 1905. From— Major P. Z.

I have the honour to refer to my letter No. 180, dated 23rd April last, with enclosures regarding Shiekh Ali bin Ahmed of Bahrein. 2. The reply given by Captain Prideaux to Sheikh Ali as directed in para graph 2 of the aoove letter was given as from himself or me, and Sheikh Esa and Shiekh Ali seem to expect a categorical answer from Government on the subject, and are frequently pressing for it. I am addressing two other communications to the Foreign Department this „ „ , day regarding Bahrein Affairs which should esi ency os. 244 an 249. reach your hands on 12th instant, and it would be convenient if Government could, after considering the latter, let me have a reply by telegram regarding Sheikh Ali, in time to write to Captain Prideaux by the Bahrein boat on 14th. 3. I do not see what reply we can well give him other than what has already been given, namely, that the British Government is great and merciful, but that his preliminary surrender to a British Man-of-War is the only condition on which we can discuss his future.

In continuation of my letters Nos. 244 and 250, dated 4th June, l have the honour to submit a copy of a further communication, with enclosure, which l have received from the Political Agent at Bahrein. No- 191 , dated 2 nd June (received 6 th June). 2. I hardly know what view the Government of India will take of Sheikh Esa’s letter of 25th Rabi-ul-Awal to the Political Agent, but it is evident from th,e translation that the tone of it is very unseemly and I think Sheikh Esa would hardly have dared to write it had he not had some astute prompter at his elbow when he did so. At the same time, apart from the unsatisfactory tone of the letter generally, there are one or two references in it not altogether unwelcome ; firstly, Sheikh Esa’s reference to his Treaty obligations ; and, secondly, his mention of the Customs question. 3. I am on the point of visiting Koweit for a day or two, and if I fail to send an answer by this mail to Bahrein, I shall have to wait for a fortnight. I have therefore decided to send the Sheikh a reply which will I hope keep him quiet until the Government of India have had time to consider the position. A copy is attached. It was not easy to know how to answer him, but I have come to the conclu sion that it is best on the whole not to take him too seriously. In case however the Government of India should not approve of what 1 have written, I am send ing the communication to Captain Prideaux in memorandum form and have asked him simply to have it read to the Sheikh in his presence. If anything seems to require emendation the Sheikh can be addressed later in official form. No. 191, dated Bahrein, the 2nd June 1905. From— Captain F. B. Prideaux, Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of correspondence ending with my letter No. 174, dated the 27th May 1005, I have the honour to enclose, for your information, translation of a letter dated the which the Chief of Bahrein has addressed to me. 2. The Chief first wrote a letter identical with this one, except for the fact that it contained in the sentence beginning ' What then is the reason for ^ thus insulting me, for taking possession ot my house and property, the additional words “ and the felling of my flag-staff”. I pointed out to the Sheikh that I had written to him on the 28th April 1905, informing him that the flag-staff had been blown down in a recent heavy gale and that it had not been lowered by myself • he replied that he had forgotten this fact, and after some hesitation said that he’would have the letter re-written, omitting the incorrect remark. 3. The general tenor of the letter shows that the Chief does not intend to accept uncongenial advice in connection with the internal administration of his State, in spite of the written promise which he gave you. Dated 25th Rabi-ul-Awal 1323 (30th May 1905). From—S heikh Esa BIN Ali, Chief of Bahrein, To—C aptain F. B. Prideaux, Political Agent, Bahrein. Since long have I been waiting for replies to my wishes, communicated through you to the Political Resident, and nothing has transpired yet. Surely this is indifference.2 I am grieved at what I have seen of insults and of lowering of my prestige and dignity in the eyes of the British Government, at such things for instance as the appearance of men-of-war, their taking up a position indicating readi ness for war and administering terror, the arresting of mv son Hamad and placing him under confinement in the ship, the forcing of access into my nephew’s house and seizing his things—horses, camels, cattle, furniture and other effects—the packing of them off and selling them in Koweit, Bushire and Maskat and publishing to the world the insults administered, which I never deserved from the Government. If there was anything in the late disturbance, then I think the Government has achieved its object by the levying of fines and punish ment of the men. And after all this disturbance was not greater than those in other places, culminating in loss of life, yet where such punishment has not been meted out. Have I in any way failed in the observance of Treaty obligations oetween myself and the British Government ? There you see in the agreement it is stated that I have bound myself to you and promised never to allow any Foreign Government to set a foot here, and never to sell or mortgage the port, and I have always conducted myself true to the letter. What then is the reason for thus insulting me, for taking possession of my house and property (and the felling of my flag-post) and for not sending replies to requests I have submitted to the British Government ? If this is an inten tional silence, well it is a matter in which I am helpless. But there certainly has been a contravention of the Treaty obligations between me and the Govern ment. Any notion of interfering in the internal matters of State is not support ed by the terms of the Treaty, the Treaty is there in its original form and 1 have the perseverance to stick to it. As for my accepting the advices of the Government, I should like to say that I have never failed to accept them, except such as I thought would be injurious to my interests. For instance the question of the administration of Customs, and about this I have to say that I shall not feel at rest until I have got the administration in my own hands. If the Government really wishes to do good to me and to the town they may decide between me and the Banniahs and have my agreement with them cancelled, and in order that the Banniahs may get their dues I will allow them to keep the 5th part of the Customs until they are fully paid. Then this 5th too shall revert to me and I will place my own men in charge of the Customs administration. I shall feel grateful if the Government does me this kindness. I have in this letter given expression to my feelings and I desire a favourable reply from you. If, however, I fail to elicit a reply from you, I shall then be obliged to communicate with the Government of India direct. {Letter in form of memorandum from Resident to Sheikh Esa } to he read to him by the Political Agent at a personal interview.) Bushire. June Jth, 1905. After compliments .—Writing to me on 2nd June, the Political Agent has sent me your letter, dated 25th Rabi-ul-Awal, to his address. The tone of the letter causes me much painful surprise and I fear that it will be no less displeasing to the Government of India. It is only 3 months ago that, after persistently offending Government to the last degree, you obliged them to exact from you compliance with certain peremp tory demands. No good object would be gained by my entering into any discussion with you now about those recent incidents, which are so well within the memory of4 3 both of us, but the observations contained in your letter give me good grounds for referring you again to the 6th demand of Government, which referred to the future ; and for reminding you of the last two interviews I had with you in March, at w r hich in terms of complete friendliness and capitulation you assured me that you were entirely amenable to the wishes of Government and that you and your sons realised that you had no one else to look to for help in difficulty. My last piece of advice to you then was—and your last promise to me—that you should cease to lend your ear to the advice of evilly-disposed persons and should in future look upon your Political Agent as your best friend and adviser. It is consequently very disappointing to me to find from your present letter, that you are forgetting your promises so soon and again giving ear to the words of evil wishers. If the truth be said, a letter written in such a contrary spirit hardly deserves to be answered ; but although I know well that the Political Agent has already given you answers to many of the questions which you ask, nevertheless I bear with you and answer them lest vou should wrongly attribute my silence to un friendliness. Firstly with regard to your nephew Sheikh Ali. Have you forgotten that on 24th Zilhijjeh, with professed readiness, you issued a proclamation offering a re ward of Rs. 10,000 for his capture, for the expressed reason that he had rebelled against your orders, and had set at nought the commands of the British Government ; and that at the same time you proclaimed him an outlaw? Yet you now identify yourself with this same outlaw and take it as a personal griev ance that he has been expelled from Bahrein and cannot be forgiven. W hen however you say that you have been awaiting replies and that nothing has transpired, you are nut speaking in accordance with the facts. Captain Prideaux wrote to me on 11th March saying that certain inffuential persons were asking him what terms the British Government would give if Sheikh Ali offered to surrender himself. I then instructed the Political Agent to reply to Sheikh Ali’s representative that if he wished his overtures to be considered serious ly, he must write a letter signed and sealed by himself notifying his wullingness to surrender to a British man-of-war. Government were informed of that answer and have not disapproved it. The British Government is as merciful as it is great and you must realise that Sheikh Ali is no more than a mouse to them, that they should wish to harm him on their own account ; in spite of his evil deeds All they wanted, and still intend to effect, is that he shall be prevented from meddling with the Govern ment in Bahrein and from practising oppression either against British subjects or others. It was for this reason that they decided to keep him away from Bahrein for a term of years. But Sheikh Ali rebelled against their decision and fled away. If Sheikh Ali does not like life in Katar let him submit himself to the British Government and they will appoint a place for him to live in peace with his family. This was always their intention if he had not run aw-ay. If Government change their mind I will tell you, but this is their intention up to now. I told you wTen I last saw you that as you had failed to comply with all the demands made upon you, I w 7 as not sure whether Government would be satisfied with your conduct, and that sever.il points would have to await their final deci sion. The time they have taken to consider it may have seemed long to you, but you must remember that the Government of India has multitudinous important matters to deal with—not simply the affairs of Bahrein. The reply of Government is dated 1 yth May and only reached me on return from Maskat 6 days ago, since when thete has been no post to Bahrein.■MM Several matters s:ill remain under their consideration but a decision has been come to on one or two points which I am asking Captain Pndeaux to municate to you, 1 will now deal with other references in your letter— / Sheikh All's landed property.—Government have decided that subject t 0 further enquiry, Sheikh Ali’s landed property shall be left for the time being in your hands on trust. But as to the house lately occupied by Sheikh Ah in Manama. Government are of opinion that it is not advisable that it should be occupied by any of the A 1 Khalifah family for some time to come, and it will therefore remain in the Political Agent’s charge for the present. 2 As to the proceeds of Sheikh Ali’s effects and live-stock, I have to inform you that they fetched about Rs. 5.800. If Sheikh Ali does not give himself up, but remains an outlaw, any proved claims of British subjects against She. &lt;h A 1 will be paid out of it and the orders of Government asked as to the disposal of the remainder. This will no doubt depend on Sheikh Ali’s behaviour. 2. Lastly, you have referred to your Customs. It is a matter of some satis faction to me to hope from what you write that you at last realise that it will be to your interest to cease from farming them out to a contractor (as you have so often promised to do) and to conduct the Administration yourself, and I am communicating your suggestions to Government, in order to ask their views. You must remember however that to clear off all your debts to the Bunniahs the Government would have to guarantee a very large sum for you, and it would be very necessary for them to have adequate safeguards and assurances that the Customs are run to the best advantage, both so that you yourself may proht as you ought, and may recover yourself from debt, and also in or der that any money which they would have to guarantee to the Bunniahs would be regulany out of the earnings. Government have many times advised you to let them engage for you a man from India, expert at Custom matters, but you have always refused, from base less fears which evilly-disposed persons suggest to you that if you have an Indian in your Customs you will lose some of your dignity. But this is not the truth, it is only imagination. Our friend Seyyid Feisal of Maskat has for the last 5 ye^rs given up farm ing his Customs and has employed for himself trained men from India and the result is that he has now got a fine Customs House and proper premises and godowns and gets 20 or 30 thousand dollars a year from his Customs more^ than he used to from the Bunniahs, and at the same time the merchants are satisfied. Why should this profit not go into his pocket instead of that of the Bunniahs ?. And why should it not be the same in your case ? Seyyid Feisal has not lost his dignity; on the contrary, thanks to the support and favour of the British Government, he is stronger in his position than he ever was and no one can interfere with him. Seyyid Feisal is your friend, as he is mine ; and I was more than five years with him at Maskat and you can ask him whether I ever failed to be a good friend to him when in difficulty and ever gave him advice which did him harm. I am just as ready to be a good friend to you and so 1 am sure is your Political Agent, as long as you give him your confi dence and show him and me that you have an honest intention to act in con formity with the advice which the Government of India gives you for your own interests, and to be loyal to your Treaty obligations. May you be preserved and Salaam. V P. Z. COX. G. C. Press, Simla.—C-3W D.F.— 1 - 7 * 05 —&lt;5?Confidential.] No, 288, dated Bushire, the 18th (received 27th) June 1905. From-MAJOR P. Z.

In continuation of previous correspondence ending with my letter No. 2so dated iith June, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Govern-’ * No. 194, dated Bahrein, June. 9th (received 13th) ment of India, a copy of a further communi cation * which I have received from the Political Agent at Bahrein. It merely amplifies the information given in Captain Prideaux’s last letter and does not seem to require any special comment from me. No. 194, dated Bahrein, the 9th June 1905. From— Captain F. B. Prideaux, oPlitical Agent, Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 1 have the honour to refer to my letter No. 191, dated the 2nd June iqo&lt; with which I forwarded, by last mail, a translation of a letter from the Chief of Bahrein on the subject of his imaginary grievances. 2. Apart from the matter of the inaccuracy about the “felling of the flag staff, ” I have tried on two occasions—first on the morning of the 2nd June and once again subsequently—to convince the Chief that the manner in which he described his habit of rejecting such counsels of the Government of India as he found unpleasing would be likely to cause grave displeasure to Government. h ast mad steame stayed an unusually short time in this harbour and left soon after mid day. I was unable therefore to write more on this subject before the post closed. 3. I now beg to report that with a view to getting the indiscreet letter recon sidered and if possible withdrawn, I worded my remonstrances in much stronger terms than 1 have used before—stronger even than those which you adopted under orders from Government—though I do not think that I in any way exceeded the truth. J 4. I reminded the Sheikh that in 1867 his uncle Mahomed bin Khalifa broke the terms of his agreement with Government, and in consequence the latter sent an expedition to punish him. They conquered the Islands and drove Sheikh Mahomed out. Subsequently, although they knew Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa (Sheikh Esa’s father) to have also been in fault, they forgave him and made him Chief of Bahrein. Two years later a rebellion broke out against Sheikh Ali which resulted in the latter’s death, the flight of Sheikh Esa and the assumotinn of the Chiefship by Mahomed bin Abdallah. ^ The Government of India again sent an expedition here, defeated the suc cessful rebels, brought Sheikh Esa back from Katar and installed him in the Chiefship. In 1873 Sheikh Esa offended the Government by his arbitrary con duct, but subsequently made amends by apologizing and promising to consult and follow the advice of the British representatives in difficult questions in future. Since then the Government have efficiently protected Sheikh Esa from the attacks of Nasir bin Mubarak and from interfering Turkish and Persian officials Generally, Sheikh Esa’s attitude has been satisfactory, and when mistakes have been made he has not failed to submit to Government’s orders. Recently how ever two cases have occurred in which Sheikh Esa has forgotten that it is his duty to accept the Resident’s advice. A British force was sent here to exact compliance, and if he had shown resistance he would doubtless have been driven from Bahrein. - ' ~ -— He professed, however, to submit, and signed a written promise always in future to follow the advice of Government. He also promised to use his best2 endeavours to effect Sheikh All’s surrender and offered a large reward for his capture. I imagined, however, that Government would not be pleased at the fact of Sheikh All’s being still at liberty when there was no doubt that the Chief could effect his capture, and I thought that the tone of his last letter would certainly add to their displeasure. 1 further pointed out as I had often done before that if the case had been referred to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India a reply could hardly yet be expected. 5. The Chief replied that he had been badly treated, that he saw nothing objectionable in the tone of h:s letter and he expressly desired that I should not keep back the copy of it, which 1 had prepared to forward to you. 6. On the second occasion I suggested to the Chief that if he thought the written promise which had been extorted from him was unjust, would it not be better for him to address Government separately on the subject and in a more conciliatory tone, stating the grounds for his view ? I also suggested that in such a letter he might express the hope that nothing in his letter of the 30th May would give offence. The Chief repeated that he could not agree with me that there was anything offensive in what he had written, and that if Government considered that there was and called upon him for an explanation it would be time enough then to give one. 7. At the moment of mv taking leave the Chief relaxed his attitude to the extent of saying that he would consult his son Hamad further on the subject. As, however, Sheikh Hamad passed me on his way to Manama for a few days’ stay, when I was going to Muharraq, and did this in spite of my having given the Chief previous notice of my intended visit, I do not think that any result will be apparent from this consultation when it does take place. 8. The explanation of the Chief’s unreasonable attitude lies, doubtless, in the fact that he is being continually pestered by Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed, who is supported by all the younger members of the family, with requests for permis sion to come back to Bahrein and threats to involve the Chief in further trouble if his case is not soon satisfactorily settled. On Monday last, the 5th instant, the Chief sent his son Hamad to me with an urgent message that he had received news from Katar that Sheikh Ali had made up his mind to return to Bahrein. I asked Sheikh Hamad whether Sheikh Ali was thinking of attacking Manama or of surrendering himself to the Chief. Sheikh Hamad replied that he did not think he intended to adopt either of these courses ; he was tired of his uncomfortable exile in Katar and merely wished to live quietly and secretly irf some out-of-the way place in Bahrein. I told Sheikh Hamad that it was good news that Sheikh Ali was contemplating a return to Bahrein, and if he could be induced to submit himself to the orders of Government such a conclusion would be most satisfactory. If he came without any such intention, it should not be at all difficult for the Chief to cut off his retreat and to make him a prisoner. I added that if Sheikh Ali did return to Bahrein and succeeded in escaping again later, the Government of India would certainly take very serious notice of the matter. Sheikh Hamad replied that “ Inshallah,” Sheikh Ali would not come. Sheikh Esa was doing his best to dissuade him, as nobody in Bahrein would be found willing to capture Sheikh Ali, and it was recognized that his coming here in safety would be injurious to the Chief’s interests. 9. At the close of this interwiew the thought occurred to me that possibly Sheikh Ali had already landed in Bahrein. My Munshi conceived the same suspicion, and on the following day he was told by a respectable Arab that Sheikh Ali was actually at Jasera at the southern end of the island. 1 am trying to get confirmation of this report, but am inclined to think that jt is not correct as nothing fresh has transpired durng the last two days.* f &lt; * A later demi-official communication states that the report referred to was found to have no foundatior.. . r : P. Z Cox,—-14-6-03.No. 331, dated Bushire, the 16th (received the 24th) July 1905. From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—S. M. Fraser, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, I have the honour to forward copies of the letters marginally noted, addressed Political Agent, Bahrein, to Resident, Nos. 204 to me by the Political Agent, Bahrein, on s tes°iSfto% 2 otuicarAgenfBahrein, Nn. .006, receiving a copy of Foreign Department dated 16th July 1905. letter No. 1873-E. B., dated 17th May 1905. A copy of my reply to Government to the latter communication had not then reached him. My letter No. 781 to which he also refers, covered my written message of 7th June for delivery to the Sheikh. A copy of it was forwarded to Government with my No. 259 of nth June. 2. Now that the Government of India have at Bahrein a Political represent ative of some standing and experience, I take for granted that they would wish, especially at the present juncture when the affairs of Bahrein are sub judice, to be placed in possession of his views first hand in all important matters, irrespective of the question whether the Resident can entirely endorse them or not. It is on this supposition that I submit his present communication for consideration. 3. After a careful scrutiny of his recommendations I am inclined to think that the Political Agent’s zeal for reform has a tendency to carry him too fast and too far, and that his present proposals are mainly of a nature which is only compatible with a declared and effective British Protectorate. In their letter No. 1873-E. B. to which Captain Prideaux’s present com munication (No. 204) refers, the Government of India explained to me with some emphasis that they had set their face against any such extreme measure as being altogether opposed to the policy of His Majesty’s Government. They went on to express the view that they might reasonably hope that such other reforms as were necessary would be brought about by the gradually increasing personal influence of the Political Agent. The declaration of a Protectorate being out of the question, I fully concurred with the Government of India that as soon as coercive measures were held to have come to an end, our only course was to rely on the personal influence and friendly advice of our Political Agent to further our policy in other respects. When replying on this point in my letter No. 244, dated 14th June, I ventured to indicate the nature which that influence must in my opinion possess in order to have any chance of success. 4. Apart from such further reforms as this dominant influence may be able to bring about in the future, I doubt if there is any middle course open to us between the extreme ones of treating Bahrein (a) as a British Protectorate, and (£) as an independent principality. I grant that if King Log does not give satisfaction there is presumably nothing to prevent us from changing him for King Stork, but it seems to me that we cannot at one minute insist that the Ruler is an independent sovereign and expect him to assume responsibility as such (as w r e did in connection with the Fracis-Times lawsuit arising out of the “ Baluchistan ” seizure, vide the cor respondence marginally noted), and at another treat him like a petty Indian Raja and intervene in his internal administration to the extent suggested by Captain Prideaux. Enclosure, dated 16 th February 1809 , to India Office, Despatch No. 7 -Secret, dated 1 ah March 1899 to Government of India and previous corre spondence. Lest I should appear at all inconsistent in making these observations, I would reiterate here that the reforms advocated in my letter No. 123 ,dated 1 ith M.arch 1905, were proposed essentially as component items of our punitive mea sures against the Sheikh, at a time when I doubted whether Government would consider those already taken as sufficient. Since then several months have elapsed 1 C404FDbut if any of these measures can in the opinion of Government still be forced on the Sheikh before the Chapter is considered closed, so much the better. I gather however from the concluding sentence of paragraph 3, letter No. 1873-E. B. above referred to, that this is probably not the case. 5. Until I know how far the Government of India concur in the views expressed above it seems of little use my entering into a detailed discussion regarding the several matters touched upon in the Political Agent’s present com munications. Moreover his letter No. 204 covers so much ground that I feel it difficult to handle it satisfactorily in a single communication and therefore limit myself to such comment, in a separate memorandum, as it seems desirable to forward simultaneously with this letter. 6. I may mention however before concluding, with reference to paragraph 27 of the Political Agent’s letter No. 204, that if the passage which I have enclosed in a red ink parenthesis be eliminated for the present, l see no objection to the Political Agent being authorised to make a communication to the Chief in the sense of the rest of the paragraph if the Government of India do not consider that this has not already been made fully clear to him in the ultimatum presented to him on 25th February 1905. Memorandum of comment upon details of Political Agent’s letter No. 204, dated 24th June 1905. Paragraphs 3 to 10 .—Captain Prideaux here sets down not his own views but a statement of what he believes would be Sheikh Esa’s if the latter could put them into shape. Paragraph //.—In his remarks regarding the Bahrein Customs the Political Agent writes “ the state of affairs here differs very greatly from that at Muscat” but he does not explain how it differs, and l find it difficult to agree with his conclusions in the last part of this paragraph, his allusion to the British National Debt seeming inappropriate. The cases of Bahrein and Muscat appear to me to be precisely the same. In neither case is there any national administration or national account. In both cases the Ruler administers the state as a private concern, for himself • he renders account to no one and, so far as my experience goes, keeps no account. There is nothing to prevent him if he chooses, so long as he gives his regular employes something on account occasionally, from spending his whole income for the year in the purchase of a large pearl or a private steam yacht. In both cases the Rulers have always been heavily in debt to some Banian usurer, usually the Customs farmer because he will lend easiest. We may call such a loan an advance op the Customs revenue, if we wish, and it is true that as long as the- “ farmer ” is not changed the debt may continue to be carried over with the addition c&gt;f plentiful interest from one year to another, but the moment another Banian intervenes, or is brought in by the Sheikh, his draft on the last one becomes just as much a private debt as money borrowed from any other Shroff. The Sultan of Muscat up to the time I left was still paying off, and was much hampered by, old debts of this kind. Except that the Sheikh of Bahrein is better off and spends a smaller por tion of his income on his Bedouin friends than does Seyyid Feisal, the two cases seem precisely parallel. Paragraph /5.—To ordain that all aggrieved persons should be considered to have a right of appeal to the Political Agent against the Sheikh would in my opinion be incompatible with the Sheikh’s independence and the ordinance could only be worked under a full British Protectorate, internal as well as external. I am sure we should very soon and very frequently be brought to an impasse if we attempted to institute such a doctrine under the existing regime.Paragraphs ly and 28. Reform of Revenue Administration and institution of tiecord of Rights .—The remarks recorded in reference to paragraph above apply to these reforms also except in so far as the Political Agent’s influence can induce Sheikh Psa to improve the existing state of things of his own accord. Paragraph 18. The Bedouin scourge.—These Arab Chieftains cannot be expected quickly to change their ancestral and traditional ideas of which the distribution of largesse to adherents is one of the most firmly rooted. Every one of them, be it the Sultan of Muscat or the Sheikh of Koweit, the Pirate Coast Chiefs or any other influential Chief in the Arabian Peninsula, likes to be thought a modern Haroun-al-Rashid and spends a large slice of his income in subsiding the Bedouins whom he believes to be friendly to him. Sheikh Esa’s oft quoted reason is that these people whom he periodically entertains are tribesmen, or the relations of tribesmen, who were kind to him many years ago when he* fell on troublous times and was an exile in Katr. By all means let the Political Agent do all he can to induce the Sheikh to keep these people away as much as pos sible, but here again it would be difficult to forbid them altogether nor wouM it seem advisable to issue an official prohibition without adequate means of enforc ing 1*. I think the case could be met for the present by the police arrangements recommended for Manama being instituted. There would then be reasonable hope of keeping the Bedouins out of Manama or under control. Paragraph 19 .—The Slavery question has already been treated in a sepa rate communication. r Paragraph 2j .—Awe is no doubt a good feeling for the Political Agent to inspire among tbe Sheikh’s petty retainers, but in the case of Sheikh Esa himself the sentiment must be tempered by confidence if the result is to be satisfactory. Paragraph 24 .—For a Vazier I recommend new blood altogether. Any member of the Sheikh’s entourage would be handicapped by the influence of his friends and surroundings. Paragraph .22.—Sheikhs Hamed and Khalifa to be ordered to tour in India, the former for at least a year, and in the event of his refusal his recognition to be withdrawn and Khalifah recognised in his place. Having just made a pronouncement to Sheikh Hamed regarding his future conduct, we can hardly offer him an ultimatum in this sense in the absence of any further delinquency on his part. A less lengthy tour would I think be an excellent thing for him, but he would require to have an Indian or English offi cial with him and I fear that long before the year was out he would become an expen^Y£_wMte-elephant to the Government of India. The boy Khalifah on the other hand after being once lodged at school should give little further trouble. Paragraph 55.—-The formation of a small police force of 50 men for the maintenance of order in the Manama Bazaar is a comparatively simple thing but the maintenance of a small standing army of 300 men for protection purposes is a much more ambitious undertaking. I quite agree that the entertainment of such a force would be a more satisfactory means of keeping Bahrein free from attack than the annual waste of 56,000 rupees in subsidies, but the idea is opposed to Arab traditions and I fear that except under a new Chief or a Protec torate it is useless to think of it. Paragraph 29 .—Captain Prideaux’s observations in this paragraph regard ing the administration of the Customs by Sheikh Esa himself are no doubt based on my written message to the Sheikh of June 7th of which a copy was forwarded to Government. The allusions to the Customs question included therein were simply made in order not to miss the opportunity afforded to me by Sheikh Esa of introducing the topic ; but while referring to the benefits which the Muscat Customs had derived from the withdrawal of the administrations from the Hindoo “ farmers ”, I was careful to safeguard my remarks by saying that the resumption of the Bahrein “ farm ” from the hands of the Banians would be a big undertaking and that Government would require very full guaran tees for the efficient conduct of the administration. Among these I would natural-4 IT ly include selection and approval of the Superintendent chosen and the period ical auditing of accounts. I gather from the Political Agent s paragraph under reference that he considers that Sheikh Esa apparently recognises our intervention in the case of injustice or outrage inflicted on persons whom we protect or are interested in, as being a natural proceeding against which he can bring forward no reasonable arguments, but that he places the Customs question in a different category and suspects in our advances in connection therewith an attempt to en croach upon his sovereign rights. Ihe Political Agent does not, however, seem to give sufficient weight to the fact:— (i) that the readjustment of the Customs Administration may be fairly included in the category of important and necessary reforms with respect of which, if he pretends as he does to regard us as benevolent friends and not designing enemies, he is bound to listen to our friendly advice and in regard to which his frequent vacillation and exhibition of bad faith cannot be tolerated. Moreover, the importance to our trade and political interests of being in a posi tion to assure ourselves that the fiscal administration of Bahrein is reasonably efficient, and by means of it of being able to exercise some supervision and^ con trol over his finances generally, is just as paramount to ourselves as it is in the best interests of the Sheikh. No. 204, dated Bahrein, the 24th June 1905. From— Captain F. B. Prideaux, Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 1 have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 781, dated the nth June 1905, and to refer also to letter No. 1873-E. B., dated the 17th May 1905, from the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign De partment to your address, a copy of which I have received from you in advance of the other papers referred to in the 2nd paragraph of your letter under reply. 2. The message in Arabic which I have received from you for communica tion to the Chief of Bahrein was duly read out to Sheikh Isa by my Munshi in my presence at Muharraq on the afternoon of the 20th instant. Sheikh Hamad was present at the interview and on the conclusion of the conversation on the subject of your message, I delivered to him the warning from the Government of India that their ultimate acquiescence in his succession would depend entirely on his satisfactory demeanour from this time forward. Sheikh Hamad acknowledged the message briefly with the remark that he hoped always to be favoured with the approbation of Government, and Sheikh Isa tried to make excuses for his son by taking upon himself the responsibility for all the latter’s actions. With regard to your own written message Sheikh Isa gave me to understand that he still hoped the Government of India would be more merciful in their decision about Sheikh AH. He promised also not to trouble us further on the subject pending the receipt of that decision. The proposal that Sheikh Khalifa should be sent to India was not mooted, as I did not consider the occasion to be suitable. 3. With regard to the observations contained in Mr. Fraser’s letter No. 1873-E. B. of the 17th May 1905, and before I submit my specific replies I beg to lay before you the views held by the Chief of Bahrein, on the question of his position towards the Government of India, so far as I have been able to ascertain them from the disjointed and far from clear remarks he has let fall from time to time. 4. In 1861 a Convention was entered into between the Independent Ruler of Bahrein and a representative of the British Government, in which it was arranged that so long as the former abstained from certain acts disapproved by the British Government, the latter would support the Chief of Bahrein against the aggres sions of the Chiefs and tribes of the Persian Gulf.t -i J. Subsequently, in the years 18^3 to 1875 the Chief was very anxious to assert his claims to certain possessions outside of Bahrein, and he was repeatedly told that if he did not follow the advice of the Government of India to keep clear of all entanglements with the Turks, Wahabis, etc., on the mainland, the Govern ment cf India would not protect him from the consequences of his acts. 6. In these two cases it seems that the feasibility of the Sheikfds throwing off the protection of the Indian Government was fully existent. 7. This position was, however, modified by the agreements of 1880 and 1892, under which the Chief bound himself not to enter into negotiations with any other Government than the British, not to accept the Agencies of such Governments and not to alienate any of his territories to foreigners without the Consent of the British Government. On their part, the Government of India did not assume any^ fresh obligations, but the Various occasions on which they have protected the Chief of Bahrein diplomatically against States other than the tribes of the Persian Gulf may be set off against the benefits conferred upon us under 4 these Agreements. S. As a corollary to these two Agreements which relate only to the Chief's foreign relations, the right of the Government of India to protect all foreigners in Bahrein was subsequently asserted and established. 9. In 1901, at the special request of Sheikh Isa, the Government of India consented to recognize Sheikh Hamed as the heir to the Chiefship, and this is the only recorded instance in which the Government have taken cognizance of a purely internal matter affecting the principality. io* The Chief feels strongly that the alteration of his Customs System without his approval is an infringement of his internal sovereign rights which he must resist to the utmost extent of his capability, and it is this feeling alone, I am convinced, which actuates him in his misguided attitude. The reasons which cause his advisers and associates to oppose the reform are various and. purely selfish. i 1. At this point I wifi venture to refer to the resources of Bahrein and the manner in which the proposition to reform the Customs originally arose. The Sheikh’s present revenues are estimated—very roughly— to be as follows From Customs „ Date gardens „ Pearling-boats „ Judicial Fees (Khidmah) Succession Duties, etc. (at 10 per cent.) „ Town lands, shops and Khans ... „ Miscellaneous sources including Secret Ex tortions Rs. t,50,000 1,00,000 8,000 20,000 9 14,000 8,000 Total Rs. 3,00,000 His expenses are Personal, including Body-guard’s salaries Abnormal expenses [marriages, journeys, etc.) Family allowances ... ... Administration expenses ... ... Subsidies and presents to Bedouin ... Total 1,00,000 30.000 1.00. 000 14.000 56.000 3.00. 000 C404FD Bmm The income and expenditure are made closely to correspond. In bad years, retrenchments can undoubtedly be made by the cutting down of allowances and presents, and the fact that the Sheikh has received some two lakhs of Rupees in advances from the Customs-farmers bears no more heavily on him while his power to periodically sell the farm is uncontrolled than does the British National Debt on ourselves. The total of the Chief’s private debts is insignificant—some Rs. £5,000. The state of affairs here, therefore, differs very greatly from that of Maskat. 12. With regard to the origin of the Customs reformation proposal, I only write from memory, as the records of this office commence from 1900, but if I am not mistaken, the proposal was made on the Chiefs affirming, in his charact eristic insincere manner, that he could not afford some trifling expenditure—it w r as probably the enhancement of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed’s allowance. The Maskat Customs question at that time was occupying much of Colonel Meade’s attention, and the real position at Bahrein not being properly known, it was natural for him to suggest that the same reform should be introduced into Bahrein as into Maskat, 13. I am most anxious that Government should not thi ik that I have failed to realize the advantages that will accrue to the Chief of Bahrein by the introduction of the new system, and you are aware, I think that I have conti nuously done my best to make Sheikh Isa see the matter in the same light, At the same time with my increasing knowledge of affairs here I have lately been coming round to the opinion that there are two other reforms of immeasu- reably greater importance, which should be first introduced, and that while the Customs question is by no means to be forgotten it may conveniently for a little time be allowed to subside into the back ground. 14. The two abuses, which I wish to see reformed, are (i) the cruelties inflicted upon the Sheikh's own subjects by the al-Khalifa family, the Magisterial and Revenue Officials and the Kazis, and (it) the objectionable welcome which is extended every summer to hordes of Bedouin W'ho, coming from Hasa as well as from Katar, are fed at the Sheikh’s expense and in addition are permitted to commit a variety of crimes and to harass the townspeople of Manama wathout the slightest check. 15. The protection from foreign States which the Chief receives from us is * neither more nor less, it seems to me, than that which the Government of India extend to the Native States in India. In the latter all persons have the privilege of appealing to the local Political Officer against acts of oppression, and I submit that the same right should exist here. My predecessor regulated his conduct more on the pattern of a consular officer in Persia than of an Indian Political Officer, and I have consequently hitherto refused to entertain the com plaints of Bahrein subjects, though such are constantly being presented to me. 16. The most common forms of oppression are the selling, over and over again, the same plots of ground by different servants of the Chief in the latter’s name, the arbitrary resumption of date-gardens on the deaths of the original cultivators, the flagrant and almost continual acts of injustice committed by the Kazis in succession cases, and the exercise of “ Sukhra ” which the Chief has himself formally repudiated in a letter to me. 1 7. Whilst these acts of tyranny are constantly recurring it seems incongruous that we should be endeavouring to add a lakh and a half annually to the Sheikh’s income without any conditions as to the expenditure of the money, and I feel that a little unfettered supervision and an occasional investigation into alleged irregularities will have such an effect on the Chief’s revenue that, taken into consideration with the present reduction of his income for the next 2^ years of a lakh per annum—the advance money which the Customs Farmers are no longer paying for renewals of the farm —he will soon find himself against his will compelled to turn to Government for pecuniary assistance “-a step which he has 67 never yet seriously taken—and then will come our opportunity to dictate terms, when we can press for the reform not only of the Customs but also of the Land Revenue Administration, the income from which I am certain is capable of beinc* not only doubled but multiplied many times over. 18. W ith regard to the Bedouin scourge, the scandal was first brought to the n ot 1 ce of Government in a letter from the Native News Agent at Bahrein to the address of the Political Resident on the 9th September 1889. Since those days 1 am informed that the annual invasion has rather increased than dimi nished. The Chief entertains a fatuous idea that in time of pressing danger, his kindness will be repaid by the tribesmen flocking to his assistance, but as all the tnbes of Hasa are nominally subject to the Turks — the nomads being subsidized and the partially-settled sections occasionally paying revenue—-is in more likely m my opinion that they would be found on the side of the Sheikh’s a^ores- sors^ than of himself. On the one occasion when the value of the Bedouin’s services might have been tested—in 1895, in connection with the threatened invasion of Bahrein by Nasir Lin Mubarak and Jasim bin Thani—the Sheikh preferred to appeal for the assistance of the Government of India. 19. The Slavery question is a third matter in which I think a different line of conduct is called for on the part of the Bahrein Authorities, and in which we may justifiably take stronger action than hitherto, but I have nothing to add to my representations on this subject, made in my letter No, 17 dated the 26th May 1905, to which l respectfully invite a reference. 20. To return now to Mr. Fraser’s letter No, i 873-E.B., I first beg to assure you that the effect of the recent demonstration, so far as the officials,'the nobles and the unruly element of the population are concerned, has had the most desirable results, and there is little likelihood of a foreigner being again molested for some time to come, or of his failing to receive redress if unfortunately he should suffer anything at the hands of the Sheikh’s subjects. The public, however, are aware that the Government of India’s demands have not been complied wuth in full, and they are awaiting the issue with consi derable curiosity and interest. 21. The recommendations which you have submitted to Government regarding the appointment of a selected Wazir, the delegation to an Indian Officer of the task of evolving an efficient police force, and the education of Sheikh Khalifa in India are all matters, I believe, which you contemplated imposing upon the Chief as punishments or substituted demands in consequence of his failure to surrender Sheikh Ali. You recognized that the Chief would dislike each one of these measures quite as much as he dislikes the Customs proposal, placing all in the same category as interferences with his internal sovereign rights, but it was hoped that the Government of India and His Majesty’s Secretary of State would see less objection on general political grounds in the acceptance of one or more of these suggestions than in the proposal (which was decisively negatived) to include incur Ultimatum the immediate reformation of the Customs. 22. Tne lightest of the 3 suggested demands is probably the third one, and as Sheikh Hamad is still the most likely successor to Sheikh Isa, I now venture to recommend that in consequence of the non-surrender of Sheikh Ali, the Chief should be ordered to send both Sheikh Hamad and Sheikh Khalifa to India for at least a year, to tour amongst the principal Native States as well as other places of importance under careful supervision. The retention of Khalifa fora longer period could perhaps be subsequently arranged, and if Sheikh Hamad refuses to comply with this demand I would recommend that his recognition as heir-apparent be formally annulled, and Khalifa be recognized in his place. It is possible th t the Chief may object to let his son and grandson go on the score of his old age, but wffiile 1 would not admit this excuse in the case of Sheikh Hamad, whose narrow-mindedness in my opinion can only be corrected by a course of foreign travel, we could attain almost the same good results that ve desire in the case of8 V /• Khalifa If we simply provided him with a suitable native tutor^ (either Egyptian or Indian) as soon as he was recognized as heir to the Chiefship, and arranged for his making shorter tours later on or even after his accession. 23. As regards Mr. Fraser’s references to myself and my position, I sincerely believe that my post is now regarded with a considerable increase of 3.W6, judging by ihc attentions shown to me by the Bazaar*masters of both Manama and Muharraq, and other notabilities of the Islands. The Chief, too, has invariably listened to my remonstrances in the petty matters which I have had occasion to bring before him. I cannot however overlook the fact that Sheikh Isa and his family now entertain the deepest suspicion regarding the pacific system of penetration which they believe is to be inaugurated by the reformatian of the Customs, and the fact that I was so closely connected with the coercive measures that have recently been adopted is, I fear, not one that tends to give them confidence in the genuineness of my friendship. It will be up-hill work to overcome this feeling, and in the meanwhile I hope the Government of India will not press for the introduction of re f orms which we cannot claim to be entitled to on explicit (i.e., treaty) grounds. 24. With regard to the suggestion about a selected Wazir, the local candidate is a first-cousin of the present incumbent, and is at present styled Wazir to Sheikh Flamed. If this man accompanies Sheikh Flamed to India, it may perhaps later on be found that there is no great objection to his eventually succeeding to the post, 25. As to the re-organization of the Police force, it may perhaps be possible later on to convince the Chief that the permanent maintenance of such a force would be an infinitely greater source of strength than the wild Bedouin on whom he at present affects to rely, and that if he had 200 or 300 disciplined men, to protect and reinforce the ordinary population of the Islands when threat ened with Bedouin attacks, he could easily do without the assistance of our men-of-war. 26. I do not advise that this matter be broached with the Chief, until after Government have decided in favour of forbidding the ingress of the Bedouin hordes to Bahrein, and only then after the Chief has himself raised the question as to how he is to protect his islands in the absence of his Bedouin. 27. Briefly to recapitulate the policy which I recommend, I think that the Chief should be firmly told that though hitherto the Government of India have abstained from interfering in or noticing matters which concern only the Chief and his subjects, they cannot permit the protection which they give him to be used as a shelter from which he may tyrannize over and ill-treat his subjects without let or hindrance, as thereby an undesired stigma is liable to become attached to the Government’s name. [The Political Agent therefore has been given orders to take notice of all cases of injustice by whomsoever and on whomsoever committed in Bahrein and to press for the offenders’ punishment; besides this it is his duty to see that all Treaty obligations are rigorously obser- ed by the Chief’s subjects] ; on their part, the Government, while of course maintaining their right to offer friendly advice for the increased welfare of the Chief and his subjects on every matter which comes before them, are quite ready to leave undiminished the internal sovereign rights of the Chief, where they do not involve the Government of India in dishonour. 28. If this policy is approved, I am confident that the Sheikh’s faith in our bond fdes will soon return, whilst at the same time I shall be given numerous opportunities of striking at his evil advisers, and exposing their misdeeds. When the opportunities for making money by illegal methods contract, the demands on all sides for increased allowances and salaries will arise, and the Chief will at last find himself really pressed for money. Within the next two years—that is, before the Bunniahs’ customs contract expires—I anticipate that Sheikh Isa will feel the necessity for applying to Government earnestly for assistance. I1 OP^ J&gt; 'I ' t would even recommend that we should exhibit no signs of eagerness to fall ui with the Chief’s wishes, and if we could then contrive to get the Land Revenue Administration reformed and a proper Record of Rights made up at the same time as we revise the Customs Administration, we should be conferring an in estimable boon upon the whole rural population and would be paving the way for an enormous immigration of the cultivating class from all parts of the Gulf. It is well known that in ancient times a very much larger portion of the main isla.nd was cultivated than at the present day, and l believe that by means of artesian wells, the sub-terranean river which is said to come to the surface at the northern end of Bahrein in the shape of innumerable springs, could probably be tapped almost all over the island. 29. ft is inevitable, I suppose, if the contract system of the Custotus Ad ministration is to be abolished, that the Chief should be allowed, if he still insists on it, to attempt the administration himself, but it is certain that when such a time comes not only will the revenue from this source diminish, but the unfortunate merchants of Bahrein will continually be harassed with all manner of troubles. The diminution of the Customs revenue of course will expedite the course of the Chief towards bankruptcy, buuf he insists upon his right to renew the contract with the Hindus can we legitimately object, if the claim to independence in internal affairs is conceded ? Under the present system we cannot urge that injustice is done to any individuals, for the omy real suffere is the Chief himself, and a large number of other influential persons undoubted y profit as they are able to extort special concessions from the Farmers which they would not receive from a State-managed Department Even however if we allow such a contention of the Chief’s, I am hopeful that when the relations between himself and the Political Agent have become estabhshed on a more confidential footing, he will eventually allow himself to be persuaded to submit the desired application to Government. No. 205, dated Bahrein, the 24th Jane 1905. prom-s—C aptaIN F. B. PRIDEAUX, Political Agent, Bahrein, To-5-The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

Ike C 404 FDacts of oppression consist in the orders issued by the Chief to summarily delive r up to his nominees the two packets held by Ramoh and Muqbil and in the fact that from that date the heirs have been unable to recover the values of the packets or even to ascertain for certain whether they have been received by the Chief from Mohammed bin Abdul Wahab and Syed Nasir or not. It is common ly believed that Sheikh Isa himself has realized the price of the pearls and the value of the ornaments and has converted the money to his own use, in consequen ce of his having failed to obtain his customary annual advance of money from the Customs Farmers, but I think it is possible that the two dishonest debtors of the estate have also profited in perhaps paying the Chief lesser sums than those which the Mejlis fixed upon the two packets. 4. As the late Syed Khalaf was a subject of the Chief of Bahrein, under the precedents in this office his heirs would not ordinarily receive assistance from me, but in my letter No. 204 of to-day’s date I have asked permission to take cogni zance of all such cases as this in the future. I am told by my advisers that this case of tyranny is rather an exceptional one, and that the Chief does not often rob the widow and the fatherless in such open and extensive fashion, though his servants are less scrupulous than himself. 5. The further consideration also attaches to this case that, when the verdict of the Mejlis was given from this Agency, it is humiliating to ourselves that any party to the case should be so grossly ill-treated. Popular opinion is strong on the subject, as is evinced by the action of the two merchants Muqbil and Abdul Rahmarq and moreover if justice is not speedily given, I anticipate that consider able general inconvenience will result from the members of the Mejlis following the example of their two Arab leaders. 6. In these circumstances, I solicit your permission to take up this case against the Chief and the two debtors at once, without waiting for the decision of Government on the general principle involved. Translation of the Petition of Mussammat Shaha, daughter of Salman Bin Rajab, widow of Syed Khalaf Bin Syed Isa, dated 10th Rabi althani (13th of June 1903) Bahrein. My husband, Syed Khalaf, died in my father's house (where I still five) on the 27th of the month of Safar, 1322 Hijri. He left no heirs to his property except myself and my two sons, Syed Saad and Syed Khalaf, and another son, Syed Isa, by a second wife who died before her husband. On my request my father and Syed Nasir, cousin of my husband, went to Muqbil AlDukher, and informed him that the house of the deceased Syed Khalaf was occupied by certain people, that it contained certain valuables, and that I was very much afraid lest these be removed unauthorizedly from the house. Muqbil found it advisable to lock up all such places where there were effects and to stamp the locks with the seal of the deceased. 3 or 4 days afterwards the Ban ians appeared before Mr. Gaskin and informed him of the affixing of locks and seals by Muqbil. Some days later Sheikh Isa Bin Ali thought of laying open the locks and sealed apartments, of seeing what valuables they contained, of taking out these and putting them in the custody of Ramoh Banian and taking receipt thereof. His orders were executed by the late Sharidah, his clerk {Note — and in the presence of the Agency Munshi Haji Abbas). Later on Sheikh Isa found that my deceased husband owed money to several people, and he with drew the pearls from the custody of Ramoh to be valued in the presence of ex perts. The following were present in the house of Ganga Ram on the occasion of the valuation of pearls :— 1. Muqbil AlDukher. 2. Mohammad Bin Abdal Wahab. 3. Syed UIwi Bin Syed Jawwad, 4. Musaid Bin Khalifa. 5. Vishan Das, Banian.cu •,T h ? pear s were valued an&lt;3 returned to the custody of Ramob but bheikh Isa took raoney m advance from Ramoh (Rs. lo.ooo) as his share of khidma (ludicial fee or succession duty) before the pearls were sold and the case decided. Syed Khalaf had other valuables mortgaged to the Banians through Syed Nasir, for Rs. 2^000 and also other pearls mortgaged to Ali Bin Nasir for Rs. 1,000. After some time Sheikh Isa Bin Ali issued orders that the case be decided by an Ijlas composed of the following persons 1. Muqbil AlDukher. 2. Abdul Rahman Bin Idan. 3. Vishan Das, Banian. 4. Syed Ulwi Bin Syed Jawwad. 5. Haji Hasan Bin Salman. 6. Mohammad Bin Abdul Wahab.- 7. Ramoh. 8. One representative from the house of Ganga Ram. The order was placed in the hands of Muqbil. The above sat as Judges and decided that one of the Banians should be deputed to take action regard ing all the valuables of the deceased, mortgaged or otherwise, and that all the Valuables be collected together, and sold, and all liabilities of the deceased to be paid therefrom. Ramoh, Banian, offered to become responsible, and he col lected together all the valuables mortgaged to the Banians and all others. These were then put to auction, and 1 heard that they fetched a price of Rs. 1,05,000. All the purchasers except Mohammad Bin Abdul Wahab, who purchased the greater portion of the pearls, paid for their purchases there and then, but this man said he had no money just then, and he would pay and take over his share of the pearls a few days later. His share was therefore placed in the charge of Ramoh for the time being, with the explicit understanding that the pearls could be handed over to Mohammad Bin Abdul Wahab only on the occasion of his paying up the value of his purchases. The Judges then paid to the following the sums against their names, in discharge of the liabilities of my husband :— Rs. 1. Banians and Ali Bin Nasir in liquidation of mortgages ... 28,000 2. Syed Sadiq ... ... ... ,,, 10,000 3. Ramoh, in return for the sum he advanced to Sheikh Isa as “ khidma’' ... ... ... ... 10,000 Total 48,000 Thus the balance left was ... ... ••• 57 &gt; 00 ° Syed Khalaf had also a demand of Rs. 4,000 upon his cousin, Syed Nasir, for whom he paid this sum to the Banians. Syed Nasir had mortgaged certain ornaments to Banians for Rs. 4,000 and it was on this account that my husband, the late Syed Khalaf, paid Rs. 4,000 to the Banians and himself got possession of Syed Nasir’s ornaments. Later on my husband represented to Syed Nasir that the value of the ornaments mortgaged did not come up to Rs. 4,000 (it is only 3 , 000 ) so he should offer something else to make up the deficiency. Syed Nasir gave over a house for this purpose. To decide this matter, Muqbil and his colleague judges broached the subject to Syed Nasir. But Syed Nasir said that against this, he had a demand of greater value on the1 A Rut indues refused to entertain his case in consequence of his failure to'substantiate hi statement and the ornaments were forthwith deposited with Muqbil.

I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 205, dated 24th June, enclosing a copy of the petition of Syed Khalaf’s widow. 2. It would certainly appear that the lady has good grounds for her com plaint of oppression, but I cannot approve of your proposal to take up the case formally against the Sheikh forthwith as such a course appears to me to be tooI great an intrenchment upon his prerogatives. I have however referred both this case and the general question to the Government of India with whom the affairs of Bahrein are still sub judice, and as it does not appear that the widow’s interests will suffer the more for the short delay involved, it will be advisable for you not to move further in the matter until they have had time to communicate their views. 3 . Nevertheless if in the meanwhile the work of your office continues to be hampered by the refusal of persons to sit as assessors, I see no reason why you should not inform Sheikh Isa of the fact in a friendly way and in mentioning Syed Khalaf’s affairs as the apparent cause suggest that he should go into the matter in case some injustice may prove to have been done ; but as even this course will somewhat discount any further action that the Government of India may eventually sanction, it will be preferable that you should not resort to it unless it becomes a matter of urgency to do so. f i \ l} X i {Extract ) Telegram, dated the 2 nd August 1905.

Appendix A. F:iom To {Draft of a proposed letter.) The SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA in the Foreign Department, Major P. Z. COX, C.I.E., POLITICAL RESIDENT in the PERSIAN GULF. Sir, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 331 of 16th July and your telegram of 2nd August, on the subject of Bahrein affairs. 2 . I am to convey to you the satisfaction of the Government of India at the surrender of Sheikh Ali. It is hoped that this event will remove a disturbing factor from the counsels of Sheikh Esa. 3. As regards the question of our future relations with Bahrein, you submit certain proposals by Captain Prideaux, which may be summarised as follows : {a) 1 hat it would be better that, until the Political Agent has acquired adequate influence over the Sheikh, no steps whatever should be taken to press on Sheikh Esa the proposals recommended originally in your letter No. 123 (Confidential) of 11th March last and referred .to in this Department letter No. 1873 E.-B. of 17th May. {h) That the Political Agent should be authorised to intervene with direct instructions to the Chief in the following matters, namely,— {i) the oppression exercised by the A 1 Khalifa family, the Magisterial and Revenue officials, and the Kazis; {ii) the extravagant entertainment of Bedouins; {Hi) reform of land revenue administration; {iv) legal disputes between the Sheikh and his subjects. Captain Prideaux appears to hope that, by consistently adopting this policy, the Political Agent will gradually be furnished with a status in the is land indep endent of the Sheikh; that the Sheikh will thus be cowed into anattifufle of general amenability to reasonable suggestions; and that the termination of the present system of exactions will result in so much loss of revenue to the Sheikh that he will, in his own interest, desire the reform of his Customs. 4. You concur in the advisability of adopting Captain Prideaux’s first sug gestion ; but before submitting any definite opinion on his other proposals, you invite^ a pronouncement of the Government of India on the proposition that there is no middle course between the two policies of treating Bahrein ( 1 ) as a full British Protectorate; ( 2 ) as an independent principality.2 r &gt; It is clear to the Government of India that such a middle course does exist • hut before replying to your enquiry, I am to point out, with reference to vohr interpretation of a full British Protectorate as involving the right to intervene in the internal administration of Bahrein to the extent contem plated by Captain Prideaux, that there is no authority for the supposition that Great Britain would necessarily possess such a right, even were she formally to notify a British Protectorate over Bahrein to Foreign Powers This misconception is due to the assumption which has been made that the alternative to re-arding the Sheikh of Bahrein as an independent Sovereign isT treat hlm like a 8 petty Indian Baja. The analogy he^ introduced although not without its uses as indicating the methods which, m the light of Indian experience, may successfully he employed m dealing with tlie Chief must he regarded as misleading in several important respects. lor, even assuming that the measure of interference advocated by the Political Agent would be legitimate in an Indian Native State (a proposition which needs some reservations in the instance of such Chiefs as enjoy a full measure of internal autonomv), it must be borne in mind that in the case of Native States in India, the British Power is the sovereign, and not merely the Pro tecting Power, and that, in the same degree as they have lost the majority of the attributes of sovereignty as well as of independence, reciprocal rights and obligations have been created between them and the Government of India, which as yet have no exact counterpart. in the relations of Great Britain to Bahrein. . 5. The exact interpretation of a Protectorate is a general question of international law into which the Government of India see no necessity to enter on the present occasion. But, as regards the case pf Bahrein, the facts appear to them to be sufficient to establish the following conclusions. Ihey are ot opinion that Great Britain is the Protecting Power of Bahrein, and that Bahrein is, therefore, in the present state of affairs, under the Protectorate ot Great Britain in the following sense (i) The British Government, and they alone, as distinct from Turkey, Persia, or any other Power, control the foreign relations of Bahrein. The Sheikh has hound himself not to enter into relations with _ any other Power. The British Government therefore undertake the protection of foreigners m Bahrein. (ii) The reciprocal aspect of this obligation is that Great Britain is hound to protect the islands from any external aggression or assault. (iii) Prom these circumstances it results that British influence and authority are and must be in the ascendant in Bahrein. Primarily this influence is political both in character and origin : and it gives Great Britain the right to claim that, in any matter to which she attaches high importance, her advice must he foUowedT The acceptance of British advice in such circum stances is the return paid by the State for the advantages which British protec tion confers. British rights in this respect were explicitly stated in the recent ultimatum which was presented by you to the Sheikh on the 24th Pebruary 1905 in compliance with instructions. Purther, if British advice must be accepted, it follows that action in contravention of it, whether it takes the form of vacillation, of bad faith, or of open contumacy^ cannot he tolerated, the Protecting Power being the judge of the manner in which it will prohibit, reprimand, or punish such action. (iv) The British paramountcy in Bahrein is commercial as well as political in character. This follows partly as a consequence of political predominance, hut still more, in the case of Bahrein, from the undisputed commercial predominance of Great Britain in the islands and ports of the Persian Gulf. (v) The political position of Great Britain in Bahrein has given her not merely an interest, hut a recognised right of interference in the succession. It was at the instance of the ^Sheikh himself that she recognised his eldest son. She holds herself at liberty to withdraw that recognition whenever—for _ good reasons—she may think it desirable, and to nominate another successor in his place. The exercise of this right is of course inconsistent with independ ent sovereignty : and it may be said to involve in a sense direct interference3 with the internal affairs of the State. It is understood that no such right is claimed in the case of any of the Trucial States on the Arab coast of the Gulf, and its frank admission by the Chief of Bahrein is the most explicit evidence yet supplied of the dimensions which the Protectorate has already assumed. (vi) The case of the Customs may be brought within the prerogative of the Protecting Power, under more than one of the above-named heads, according to the point of view from which it is regarded. Originally the appointment of a British Customs officer was advocated by British Residents in the Gulf as a mark of British authority. Then it was recommended in the interests of the Sheikh and the equilibrium of his finances. Pinally, it was urged in the interests of Sheikh Hamed, his son, whose future position our recognition of his claims to the succession required us to safeguard. Whichever of these views be adopted, the insistence of Great Britain upon the measure may be regarded as an illustration of the advice which, in virtue of her general controlling authority, she deems it necessary to give, and which the Sheikh is not at liberty permanently to disregard. 6 . The above are, in the opinion of the Government of India, approximately the limits of our Protectorate, so far as it has a s y et been developed. It follows from this that for none of the claims put forward by the Political Agent is there any justification, and that he should not attempt to apply interference or pressure in the various forms wffiich he suggests with a view to forcing the Sheikh to adopt premature reforms, but that he should devote himself to the busi ness of acquiring the confidence of the ruler. Instructions in this sense should be given to Captain Prideaux, with a view to his building up a position which will enable him to tender advice for the gradual amelioration of the internal administration. The one point upon which the Government of India are com pelled at the present stage to offer auth oritative a dvice is that of Customs reform, which, after the previous declarations made to Sheikh Esa on the subject, is not a matter which can be allowed to rest until the Chief chooses to take action. On this matter they are prepared to await your advice as to the manner in which, and the moment when, a communication should be made to Sheikh Esa, and it will be for you to consider whether the best course would not be to have a frank explanation with the Chief, and to let him know that his dependence upon the British Government is not consistent with the permanent disregard of the advice so frequently tendered to him in this matter; advice which when thus seriously repeated, must be regarded as possessing the authoritative character referred to in the ultimatum presented to him in February last.

The Chief replied that Sheikh Ali was unlikely to pay any attention to his advice and asked me to favour him with a letter from myself to the address of his nephew. 3 . I enclose an English copy of the letter which I sent to the Chief for trans mission in compliance with this request, and also a translation of the reply which I have received from Sheikh Ali. 4 . Sheikh Esa informs me that tnere is little doubt that Sheikh Ali is now ready * to come in, and states that he is sending a boat over to Katr to fetch him As soon as the fugitive arrives here, I shall report the fact to you, and in the meanwhile I venture to hope that the decision of the Government of India will be obtained as to where he should be conveyed by our man-of-war and as regards his subsequent disposal. 5 . I recommend that the Government now insist on his residing in India for at least 3 years at his own expense, and after that time he be permitted to go anywhere he pleases so long as he keeps away from the Persian Gulf and Maskat, Basrah and Baghdad for another two years. He will then probably elect to*go to Mecca and Egypt.

In continuation of my letter No. 237 , dated the 15 th July 1905 , I have the honor to report that Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed with 4 of his servants who were sen tenced to expulsion from Bahrein returned and surrendered themselves to Sheikh Isa on the 18 th instant. 2 I have impressed upon the Chief that he is absolutely responsible for their safe custody until they are taken over by one of our Government vessels, and Sheikh Isa replied that he recognized this fact. Sheikh Ali is staying with his brother Muhammad in Manama. 3 . The 4 &lt;( hooligans” who have returned are Zaeed bin Saad, Zaeed bin Ferhan, Bakhit Nubiand Saad Kahtani. Of these the first two were amongst those who were flogged on the 4 th December 1904 , and the others were amongst the 6 additional men whose surrender was demanded on the 25 th February 1905 . The remainder who have not surrendered have left Sheikh Ali and are believed by him to have gone pearling in boats belonging to Katar. Sheikh Ali proposes to take the four, who have comeback, into exile with him, and trusts that when he returns to Bahrein they will be allowed to accompany him. I hope that you will recommend to Government the modification of these men’s sentences accordingly, as they all have families in Bahrein, and their master will doubtless keep a stricter control over them in the future. 4 . Now that the whole of our original demands are practically complied with before any alternatives have been presented to Sheikh Isa, it seems doubtful whether we should frame any more in connection with the past incidents. At the same time I think that much benefit will accrue from Sheikh Hamad’s ob taining a better acquaintance of our power and methods by a year’s visit to India, and I still therefore recommend that this course be pressed upon him on the ground of the desirability of his becoming better acquainted with the country that will in the future protect him in his rule over Bahrein.

No necessity for Government to contribute towards Sheikh All’s maintenance. When in Bahrein, he enjoyed property and perquisites bringing in about 15,000 rupees per annum; but as regards landed property, Sheikh Esa claims that his nephew is only tenant for life. Simplest plan is to leave Sheikh All’s property on trust with Sheikh Esa, and call upon Sheikh Esa to pay to Political Agent regular monthly allowance for transmission to exile. I consider that 300 rupees per mensem would suffice, hut should like to consult Prideaux and Sheikh Esa on this point. Meanwhile the proceeds of Sheikh Ali’s live-stock, amounting to 500 odd, is available and can be used for his travelling expenses and maintenance.

If you advise it, he might he permitted to select one or two of them as companions, but for the others and the six who have not yet been surrendered, you may submit proposals, if you recommend the modification of the sentence in the ultimatum.

I discussed these points with Sheikh Ali on his first arrival. His argument then was that, as brother and four culprits had spontaneously followed him, Arab tradition would not allow him to dismiss them, and he would prefer to bear their expenses. I have now discussed question with him again, it being understood that brother may visit Sheikh Ali from time to time while in exile; he elects, on my advice, to return now to Bahrein and look after Sheikh Ali’s family and affairs. As regards four rowdies, Sheikh Ali still considers that he cannot dismiss them, but says they are under orders of Government. I have, therefore, told him that I shall recommend Government to give them six months’ incarceration in India and then set them free. On release, they might be sent back to Bahrein, and expenses of incarceration and return fare might, if Government so desire, be debited to Sheikh Ali’s account. Final instructions awaited.

The telegram is a repetition in greater detail ot the complaint which Mueurus Pasha was instructed to make on February 22nd and which is recorded in J \ Lord Lansdowne’s despatch to Mr. Townlev No.59 of that date, forwarded to you on March 1st. In both cases it is alleged that punitive measures were taken in consequence of an assault on a European; whereas according to the reports received from the Government of India reparation for the mal treatment of the German subject Mr. Bahnsen was obtained The Under Secretary of State, India Office. robtained by Major Cox In December last, without the assistance of His Majesty's Ships and It was In con nection with an attack upon Persian subjects that, the naval demonstration of February last became nec- essary. The present document contains other and more serious misstatements; the allegations tnat the Bahrein customs were occupied hy British Officers and fishing dues levied are clearly entirely without foundation and the account given of the proceedings against Sheikh Ali, when compared with the reports furnished hy the Admiralty, appears to he incorrect in nearly every particular. Mu sums Pasha has again been instructed to press for an answer, and Lord Lansdowne would pro pose to reply that the report received hy the Turk ish Government from the Commander of the 5th Army Corps at Bagdad is in. many material respects incor rect and exaggerated, hut that His Majesty’s Govern ment cannot discuss the details of the measures taken; that they can only repeat the statement made to His ExcellencyExcellency on the 22nd of February last and in Sir P. Currie's Note to the Porte of August 12th, 1895, that the island of Bahrein is under the protection of His Majesty's Government and that they are entirely within their rights in taking any measures they may think fit to obtain redress for outrages there or to protect the island from aggression and, finally, that they must decline to take notice of any further com plaints from the Porte on the subject. Lord Lansdowne is not aware that there is any foundation for the statement in the last paragraph of Misurus Pasha's communication that the Sheikh now declares himself to be a Turkish subject, and he would be glad to learn whether any confirmation of this assertion has been received from the Government of India.

In February last Sheikh Ali bin Mahomed, the senior first cousin of Sheikh Esa, and eldest son of the deposed Chief, Mahomed bin Khalifa, pro ceeded—nominally on a sight-seeing tour—to Koweit, Basrah, Baghdad, Nejef and Kerbela. This Sheikh Ali is considered to be on very friendly terms with the present Chief; he is also one of the few members of the Khalifa family who have turned their attention to commerce, with the result that he is said to be in fairly affluent circumstances. Provided that he has no personal ambitions and having regard to the considerate manner in which the Chief treats him, l think it is quite pos sible that Sheikh Ali bin Mahomed may have been entrusted by Sheikh Esa with some secret mission to the Turkish authorities in Baghdad. 3. Secondly, it is common gossip in the bazaar that Mahomed bin Abdul Wahab Pasha is afraid to return to Bahrein, because the British have detected his complicity in some act of treachery towards them! It seems that this worthy has arranged to make Debai his head-quarters during the present pearling season ; as he left Bahrein last January on the friendliest of terms with me, and I have had no communication with him since, it is difficult to understand his motive for shunning Bahrein which has always been his place of residence at this time of year. 3. Thirdly, I have heard from two sources—one a Persian shop-keeper and the other Sheikh Hamad bin Mahomed—that the Chief has had frequent inter views with Monsieur Perronne, the Frenchman who recently arrived here osten sibly for the purchase of pearls, and the Persian’s report runs that the Chief has invited M. Perronne to fly the French flag. I had previously received a reliable report that M. Perronne had paid one visit to the Chief, and at my last interview with the latter, Sheikh Esa also informed me of this fact and asked whether there were any objections to the Frenchman’s staying in Bahrein. Until, therefore, I should receive further evidence of underhand conduct on the Chief’s part I felt unable to credit the rumour above mentioned and accordingly did not report it last week. To-day I hear on reliable authority that M. Perronneis on the friendliest of terms with Sheikh Mahomed bin Ahmed, a brother of the fugitive Sheikh Ali. It is possible therefore that this Sheikh may have been acting as confidential medium between the Chief and the Frenchman, other hand the intimacy may merely have originated from the general belief in the antipathy existing between Germans and Frenchmen, which may have prompted Sheikh Mahomed bin Ahmed to seek M. Perronne’s sympathy for his brother. 5. On all these points I hope to gain further information during the next few days. It is difficult to believe that Sheikh Esa can entertain for a moment the hope* that he can with the help of any other Power effect the rupture of the ties which bind him to us, but I am sure that his son Sheikh Hamad would use all his influence and power to bring about such an end if he could. So long as the Government of India were willing to act as a buffer between Bahrein and all foreign Governments and at the same time to give the Chief and his family a free hand in their acts of tyranny and misrule over the unfortunates whom they had conquered little more than a century ago, the position was an ideal one from the Khalifa’s point of view. 6. At the present day the Treaty of 1820 is almost a dead letter. The Trucial flag is never seen and slaves are bought and imported not only constantly from Katar and Hasa but even occasionally, I am told, direct from Sur in Oman. I have reason also to believe that the agreement of 1898 on the subject of the Arms Traffic is similarly disregarded. These are the reasons why Sheikh Esa dreads the proposed scheme for the reformation of his Customs, and at the same time they should—I venture to say—stimulate us to insist upon the Sheikh's complete submission to our will.

The letter No. 174 quoted in paragraph 5 of the enclosure, is in reference to Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed. SheikhSheikh Esa in sending the Political Agent a copy of a communication which he has received from his nephew, writes that he fears that if Sheikh Ali does not receive a communication to the effect that his case will he favour ably considered he may possibly take up w some revolutionary ideas and approach another Government with requests”. 3, I can hardly suppose that His Majesty*s Government would recognise Sheikh Ali as the subject of any Foreign power, whether Turkey or some other, under any circumstances. Possibly however the Commander of the troops at Baghdad may have been told of Sheikh Ali*s readiness to become a Turkish subject, and then substituted Sheikh Esa*s name for Sheikh Ali*s.

Agent, Bahrein, I have the honour to state that this individual has been closely watched since his arrival in the Gulf, and I submit for the information of the Government of India a copy of the last Memo randum furnished to the Central Criminal Intelligence Department, Simla, by my First Assistant under date 14th May. Copy of a Memorandum forwarded to the Director t Central Criminal Intel ligence Department } under Residency endorsement No. 64$) dated 14th May 190$. The Frenchman Gaston Perronne referred to in this office Memorandum No. 530, dated 16th April 1905, is a smartly dressed little man with a healthy florid complexion, narrow brown moustache and dark brown eyes; age about 26 years, height between 5 feet 4 inches and 5 feet 6 inches, and stoutly built for his height. Speaks English very fairly. He states that a year or two ago he completed his term of compulsory service in the French Army, that having an adventurous spirit and some little means of his own, he went towards Tibet presumably, via China and there invested in musk and skins which eventually brought him a profit of ^3,000. He now intends to try his luck at pearls for a season at Bahrein and hopes to go back to China next cold weather. Monsieur Gaston Perronne travelled up to Bushire and after completing his period of quarantine spent 2 days ashore and then returned to Bahrein. His fellow passenger was one Mahammed Ali bin Haji Ahmed Khan (the Sadid-es- Sultaneh) who was formerly Persian Foreign Office Agent and Passport Officer at Bushire and is now the Russian Consular Agent at Bunder Abbas. The Sadid introduced him to 2 leading Arab merchants of Menama (Bahrein). On the strength of a letter of introduction secured by M. Perronne from Haji Abdul Rahman, French Consular Agent, Lingah, Abdul Rahman bin Idan readily leased him a new house at Bahrein for such period as he may require it. G. C. Prm. Simla,»No. 317 P.

With reference to your telegram, dated 14 th instant, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of Captain Prideaux’s letter No. 175 , dated 27 th May 1905 , which should have accompanied my letter No. 249 , dated 4 th instant. No. 175, dated Bahrein, the 27th May 1905. From— Captain F. B. Prideaux, Political Agent, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my letter No. 162 , dated the 19 th May 1905 , on the subject of the rumours that the Chief of Bahrein is attempting to place himself under the protection of another Power, I have the honour to report that as the result of my enquiries I am unable to believe that Sheikh Esa has personally yet involved himself in written correspondence with either the Turks or the French. 2 . I do not think it likely that Sheikh AH bin Mahomed would be selected by the Chief as his mouth-piece in making overtures to the Turks nor that he would consent to act as such if he were. 3 . I have learnt that M. Perronne has only once been to Muharraq, but on that occasion he stayed there the whole day, and besides calling on the Chief he visited most of the notabilities of the place. 4 . It is probable that Mahomed bin Abdul Wahab Pasha is at the bottom of the rumour under investigation. He is in the habit of corresponding occasionally with all the foreign Consuls in Bushire and poses as the sincere well-wisher of each. He also is unofficially recognized by the people of Bahrein as the mouth piece of the Turks, whose subject he is. The two^ or three persons, whom I have confidentially consulted, are unanimous in thinking that Mahomed bin Abdul Wahab has been sounding both the Turkish and French Consuls ^ at Bombay on behalf of Sheikh Esa, and that the statement made by the Turkish Ambassador in London to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs can only be founded on some communication made by Mahomed Pasha either verbally in Bombay or by letter to some other Turkish official. I couple my mention of the French with that of the Turks, because locally there is no rumour of the latter having been approached, while the belief is fairly popular that some intrigue is in existence between the Chief and M. Perronne. It seems possible that the latter may have communicated to the French Consul in Bombay some enquiry of the Chief’s as to the likelihood of his being assisted by the French Government. 5 . As regards Mahomed Pasha, it is well known that he was the instrument which brought Sheikh Jassim bin Thani into the meshes of the Turkish Empire, and that he has often urged Sheikh Esa to follow the same course. From Sheikh Esa’s letter, a translation of which I am submitting to you to-day under cover of a separate report No. 174 , it is also, I think, evident that the Chief has already considered the possibility of this move. It is natural, too, that the course of recent events in Koweit and Nejd should influence the mind of the Ruler of Bahrein to some extent. 6 . Taking the above points into consideration I do not think that the reason given in the last paragraph of your telegram of the 17 th May 1905 to the Secre tary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, for not confronting Sheikh Esa with the report has much force, if I may be permitted to say so, but at the same time I am quite of opinion that until the Turkish Ambassador presents proofs to show that the Chief has acted in a manner which we should regard as tantamount to rebellion against the Government of India, it is supererogatory for us to accuse him of such an act.

Cox., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Officiating Secretary to the Governraeut of India in the Foreign Depart ment. In continuation of the correspondence ending with Foreign Department telegram No. 744-E. B., dated 18th February, to my address, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, a report regarding the measures since taken at Bahrein.' 2 . I arrived at Bahrein on the evening of 23rd February in H. M. S* Redbreast, which had been placed at my disposal by the Senior Naval Officer in lieu of the Lawrence recently deputed to assist the operations of the Gazetteer party on the southern coast of Oman. At Bahrein there were already H. M. S. Sphinx, which had been on duty there for some days as guard-ship, and H. M. S. Fox under the command of Captain J. B. Eustace, Senior Naval Officer, which had preceded me from Bushire. In order to save daylight I did not wait for the Sheikh’s usual visit on hoard but landed at once and asked him to pay his visit at the Agency the following morning. Captain Prideaux, Assistant Political Agent, had kept him informed as far as possible of my movements and had advised him, for the more expedi tious transaction of business, to take up his residence at Manama during my stay, but this he had not arranged to do, and when I arrived he was himself residing at Muharrug as usual, while his son Sheikh Hamed, with his zenana, was absent at his country-house some miles outside the town. Sheikh Esa, however, came over to call upon me in the morning as requested, accompanied only by his young grandson Khalifa, an apparently nice boy of 14 or 15 years, whom the Chief almost invariably has in his company. The Senior Naval Officer and Captain Prideaux were present at the interview and the usual formalities were exchanged. As soon as these were concluded I informed the Sheikh* that I had come over to make an important communication to him on behalf of Government and requested him to be present at the same hour next morning to receive it. He expressed his willingness to do so, and as he had already been informed by Captain Prideaux, at the time of the settlement of the German case, that had the orders of Government been received in time, Sheikh Ali would not have been allowed to return, I thought it as well to warn him before leaving that the departure of his nephew from Bahrein was an item of the decision of Government in regard to the recent cases, and that he had better cause him to make preparations for early departure. I also told him that his son Hamed’s proper place was beside his father, and that I hoped that he would be forthwith summoned from his suburban residence. 3. The Chief arrived up to time next moruiug, accompanied by his son Abdulla and the grandson before mentioned and was received with suitable honours at the Agency. His eldest son Hamed was still absent, but was expected. With me were the Senior Naval Officer, Captain Prideaux, Assistant Political Agent, Cammander Bowman of H. M. S. Sphinx, and Lieutenant Gabriel, now at Bahrein on Gazetteer duty. The ultimatum of Government was duly presented to the Chief in the detailed form, of which a translation forms Enclosure No. 1 of this report. The only special remark w hich the terms of it seem to call for is in reference to Demand No. 1, to which I added the names of the four persons who had before been flogged and expelled in connection with the German case, but who had since been allowed by Sheikh Esa to reappear in Manama. Having mastered the details of the ultimatum as now presented to him, the Sheikh proceeded to press persistently and to advance every possible pretext for an ^extension of the time, namely, 24 hours, given for compliance, and an analysis of Ins protestations made it evident that it was especially in connection2 with the deportation of Sheikh Ali that he was so anxious to gain time. In view, however, of the fact that he had already had tw o months in which to ponder over my previous demands and his own position, and that the foundation of his present attempts to procrastinate could hardly he anything else than the hope of ultimately evading our demands, his successive entreaties for six, five, four, three or even two days were not acceded to, and as soon as he had been furnished with a copy of the ultimatum the meeting was adjourned until the following morning. I would draw attention here to the fact that throughout my previous visit and up to now the contingency of his being impotent to produce either Sheikh Ali or the other men wanted had never been suggested or allowed by the Sheikh. On the contrary he had always sought to preserve the polite fiction that they were entirely under his control. 4. Shortly after noon Sheikh Abdulla returned to the Agency and informed Captain Prideaux that having been ordered by his father, on leaving our presence, to send another summons to his brother and uncle, and also to warn Sheikh Ali to present himself before the Chief at Muharrug, he had in due course proceeded to Sheikh Ali’s house and from the latter’s response he feared • that he was likely to abscond during the night. He was directed to inform his father at once and to warn him to take immediate steps to ensure his nephew’s presence in the morning as arranged. At 3-30 p.m. Sheikh Esa himself came over aeain from Muharrug, accom panied by a Dhow full of armed followers. He came straight to the A gency and informed me that Sheikh Ali evidently intended to abscond, if he had not already done so, and that he had therefore brought some armed men for the purpose of arresting him, but that to this end he would be glad of the moral support of some representative of the British Agency or of a few s *poys from the Agency guard. How far he was now acting in good faith it was difficult to say, neither was there time to ascertain, but it seemed to me that if we now refused to co-operate with him he might afterwards plead that if he had been siven the slight assistance asked for he would have been able to comply with this item of the ultimatum. Accordingly it was decided that Captain Prideaux and Lieutenant Gabriel should accompany the Sheikh’s men, with a dozen sepoys from the Infantry Detachment, but that they should remain in the back ground and only give assistance in case it was actually required. At the same time the Senior Naval Officer was asked by signal to co-perate from the harbour and he did so by sending two armed boats to lie off the shore opposite Sheikh Ali’s house. The Chiefs son, Abdulla, was in charge of the former’s men and it was left to him to enter the house and endeavour to induce Sheikh Ali to give himself up. In the interval Sheikh Esa himself remained in my company at the Agency, and we were now joined by his brother Sheikh Khalid, of Buffa, and his son Sheikh Hamed. It soon transpired, however, that Ali had escaped earlier in the day, im- mediately|on receiving Sheikh Abdulla’s message, (or warning ?), and accordingly Sheikh Khalid left shortly afterwards ostensibly furnished with peremptory instructions from the Chief to scour the island during the night in search of his fugitive nephew. It would probably have been possible to have prevented Sheikh Ali’s- escape by putting Bluejackets ashore in the morning and surrounding his house, but that would have been a more or less hostile act which it di(T not seem that we were justified in taking before the expiry of the 24 hours allowed for compliance with the terms of the ultimatum. 5. This period expired at 9 a.m. the following morning, Eebruary i 6 th, and on that day Sheikh Esa arrived at the Agency half an hour before the time, accompanied by his sons Hamed and Abdulla. He intimated that he had brought with him the 2,000 rupees demanded as compensation for the Persians, and also the draft notification in connection with the application of the right of “ Sukhra ^This w as subsequently amended and provisionally approved by me and issued in the form shown in Enclosure No. 2 ). He added that the 50 men whom he had been called upon to furnish as a Bazaar guard would be produced for inspection at any time that - £ 3 $$ ,nrgbt be appointed. With regard, however, to items 1 and 4 of the ultima tum be stated that be had so far been unable to lay hands on any of the 10 men required, and he had obtained no further news of Sheikh Ali as his brother Khalid bad not yet returned. He nevertheless expressed bis desire to comply with the orders of Government and agreed to assist us in annexing such attachable property as bis nephew might have left behind. A little later Sheikh Kh did returned, but bis appearance evidenced no trace of the exhausting effect which his all-night exertions might have been expected to produce on a man of his age. He reported that he had ascertained that Sheikh Ali, with 8 or iO followers, bad escaped to the mainland in the boat of some fishermen which they had commandeered at a village on the eastern extremity of the island, opposite Katr. The Senior Naval Officer, Captain Prideaux, and myself in consultation, now came to the conclusion that even presuming that Sheikh Esa had connived at Sheikh Ali s escape, his compliance with three of the demands and his agreement to hand over the fugitive’s property made it hardly justifiable' for us to proc ed to extremities, but it was decided to call upon him forthwith to send his son Hamed on board one of the men-of-war, both as a hostage and as a proof of his own faith. After considerable demur on bis own part and that of bis son be finally accepted the situation, and Sheikh Hamed was at once sent off in a man-of- war’s boat to H. M. S. on the understanding that if found nece c sary he should be detained there pending receipt of further telegraphic in structions from Government. The Sheikh was also assured on our own part that it was not part of our intention to deport Hamed to Maskat or elsewhere in lieu of Sheikh Ali. 6 . Sheikh Hamed having embarked steps w^ere then taken to annex on behalf of Government Sheikh All’s house and realisable property, after allowing sufficient time for h : s zenana to be removed and suitably housed elsewhere with their immediate personal and household necessaries. They were taken charge of by Sheikh Khalid. A detachment of Marines was landed by the Senior Naval Officer to surround tbe house and keep order during its attachment, and the same course was followed the next day while Sheikh Ali’s effects where being removed. As soon as the house was completely cleared out it was placed in charge of a sepoy guard from the Agency, which will now bo conveniently housed there pending the erection of permanent quarters for them. I m &lt;y mention that while co-operating with us in the attachment of the hou'e Sheikh Ksa asked me to take cognizance of the fact that it was not, accord ing to him, Sheikh Ali’s absolute property but was in fact the “ Government House ” of Al anama, and part of the ancestral possessions of the Al-khalifa family. I shall discuss this point, however, in a separate communication and merely mention it incidentally here. Two native crafts, pointed out by Sheikh Esa as belonging to his nephew, were burnt where they lay, and the remainder of his property, consisting of per sonal effects and live-stock, were collected at the Agency for distribution and sale in due course. I shall address Government subsequently with regard to the disposal of the proceeds of the effects confiscated, which it was obviously not desirable to keep in Bahrein. 7. On 28th February the Sheikh definitely intimated that Sheikh Ali and the 10 culprits had escaped from Bahrein territory to the mainland and that he was altogether unable to produce them. At the same time he under took to publish notifications proclaiming their banishment and offering a re ward of 10,000 rupees for Sheikh All’s arrest and 200 rupees for that of each of the 10 hooligans. Translations of these notices form Enclosures 3 and 4. So far, then, as the actual terms of the ultimatum were concerned, all the measures that were rendered practicable by the circumstances had now been taken ; there remained to be considered, however, the case of the Mullah brothers, Jasim and Ahmed-bin-Mahz i, whose sinister influence in Manama had been brought into marked relief during the recent incidents. During the present proceedings they had been wise enough to abstain, outwardly at all events, from anv special intrigue which w r ould in itself have warranted the taking of drastic measures against them, but I was quite at one/ I y 4 with Captain Prideanx in thin king that it would he a mistahe to allow the present measures to close without administering to tin m a warning calculated to prompt them to conduct themselves in future with more circumspection and to refrain from interferring in matters of government outside their priestly functions. I, therefore, suggested to the Sheikh whose attitude had now become much more satisfactory and submissive, that he should send them both over to the Agency to v sit me, giving them at the same time on my behalf an absolute assurance of safe conduct and courteous treatment while here, dhis course he readily assented to. In the result the elder brother, Sheikh Jasim, cime over at OQce accompanied by the Chiefs brother Khalid They both made excuses for Sheikh Ahmed, who, they naively assured me, had been out of his house when the message was sent them, but had been summoned from his garden and would present himself later in the evening. It subsequently transpired that immediately on getting the Sheikh’s message he had followed the example of Sheikh Ali and had decamped, after removing everything from his house. Stronger proof than this of his disaffection or better justification of previous opinions expressed with regard to him could hardly be wished for. Sheikh Jasim. who on his first coming had been spoken to very plainly, paid the Agency two or three hurried visits wii hin the ensuing 24 hours, in the course of which he managed to divest himself of most of the unctuous pomposity wilich he had at first assumed and now professed to admit freely the error of his brother’s ways and his unbec ming interference in matters which did not concern him. He, however, expressed the confident hope of being able to bring Sheikh Ahmed in and begged as a personal favour, for which he would always remain mindful, to he given a little law for this purpose before any notice of banishment were issued against him. He was accordingly granted 24 hours and informed at the same time that after that no further law would be given unless he himself w ent on board one of the men-of-war as a hostage pending his brother’s submission. It was never expected that he w ould commit himself to such a course, but the 24 hours having elapsed he at once took me at my word, and, coming overdo the Agency on first instance, expressed his desire to proceed on board H. M. S. Sphinx, in the hope that the communication to his brother of the fact that he, {Sheikh Jasim, had surrendered himself as a hostage to ns, would induce him to return. The embarkation on board one of His Majesty’s ships of so venerable a minister and one who had hitherto considered himself too important a personage, even to call upon the British representative, was an incident likely to have such an excellent eifect upon the native mind that no difficulties were placed in his way and he forthwith left the shore in a man-of war’s boat to join Sheikh Hamed on the Sphinx, where the accommodation was the most suit able and where he appears to have made himself thoroughly at home. The precise agreement upon which he went was that his stay should not be permitted to extend over 72 hours, and that if his brother, who had probably crossed to the mainland, could not be brought in within that time, the latter would be posted as under ban of expulsion and would not be allowed to return to Bahrein. 8 . Ihe following morning, 2nd March, there being no further need of the presence of three men-of-war, the Senior Naval Officer with H. M. S. Fox left for Bombay,^ whither she had been ordered to proceed immediately on the conclusion of her work here. Before Captain Eustace’s departure^ however, he, Captain Prideaux, and I, paid an official visit to Sheikh Esa m order to show him and the public that coercive measures were now at an end as far as the action of His Majesty’s ships was concerned. I forgot to mention above that on 26th instant we had insisted on the Sheikh coming over to live m Manama for the remainder of my stay, his residence away at Mulurrug rendering speedy communication with him so difficult After a good deal of demur on the score of inconvenience he arranged to do so from 27th February. I take this opportunity of giving expression to my thanks for the very cordial and effective assistance and support which I received from the Senior x aval t fficer,^ Captain Eustace, throughout the interviews and proceedings generally during which he was at all times in close touch and consultation with myself and Captain Prideaux. I would also record appreciation of the work /done by Lieutenant-Commander Somerville of H. M. S. Redbreast, who, during some weeks ^ spent here on survey and guard duty, had obtained a quantity of detailed information and had prepared sketches of important sections of the islands which would have been most valuable had it become necessary to open hostilities. J 9. In view of the fact that possession of Sheikh Ali’s person was not effected, the measures taken can hardly he regarded as completely satisfactory, but, on the other hand, it may perhaps be considered that the fact that Sheikh Ah has by his night to the mainland placed himse’f under sentence of complete banishment, is from some points of view a more convenient denouement than an alternative which would have entailed our watching him and perhaps maintaining him for some years to come. At any rate, the Sheikh of Bahrein seems to me to have been thoroughly brought to liis bearings, while loss of life and local upheaval have been obviated. I trust, therefore, that on the whole the Government of India will be satisfied with the measures taken, even if the terms of the ultimatum have not been completely fulfilled. 1 j'i SinCe the aboy ? P ara ? r aphs were written the truant Mullah, Sheikh Ahmed, has repented of his precipitate flight and surrendered himself. The delay in his return has been due to the fact that he had already reached the mainland of Katr when his brother’s last message reached him. Sheikh Jasim has accoidingly been allowed to disembark from the Sphinx and after interviewing both brothers together in the presence of Captain Prideaux and reading them a very frank homily on the unsatisfactory character of their demeanour in the past and the intention of the Residency and of Government not to tolerate any repetition of it in future, I have allowed them to go their way, after a friendly expression of the hope, and the warning, that they should in future limit their exertions to their recognised sphere and maintain the friendly relatiocs with this Agency which they admit that our forbearance has now inaugurated, 11. Before leaving Bahrein I have given further consideration to the question of Sheikh Hamed’s detention. The conditions of it were explained in P a Wh 5 above. Since then, granting the initial fact, or presumption, that Sheikh Ali was allowed by him to escape, Sheikh Esa has so far shown his desire to act in acc 'rd with the wishes of Government by handing over his nephew’s house and property and by issuing the proclamations set forth in the enclosures to this report. I here are several questions connected with the immediate future of the administration of government in Bahrein which it will be ne cessary to place before the Government of India, and this I shall proceed to do with as little delay as possible ; meanwhile Sheikh Hamed’s temporary detention on board H. M. S. Sphinx and the other incidents of the la^t few days will,^ I hope, have imbued him with some sense of his own impotence and the futility of imagining that he and his father can continue with impunity to flout the wishes of the British Government, to whom indeed they owe every thing. I propose, therefore, after consulting Captain Prideaux, to allo w him to return to the shore before I leave Bahrein to-day. i 12. Sheikh Esa has just visited me in order to have a final conversation before my departure and was evidently much relieved, and grateful, regarding I the permission to Sheikh Hamed to come ashore. I find his attitude altogether j changed, and it is now rather that of a naughty child coming repentant before I his parents than that of a ruler of some 70,000 souls who two months agoi spoke as arrogantly as if he were ready to defy the British Government ton any extent. He said that he was now entirely submissive to Government and f that he and his children recognised thart when it came to difficulties they hadlj no one else to look to. I replied that I hopq^ie would give proof of his assurances i m the future and would look upon his Political Agent as his best friend andf adviser. Before taking leave he presentend me with the title-deeds of a plot of* ground adjoining the Agency compound which I had told him we needed as a site for quarters for the Infantry Guard and had asked him to acquire from the owners for us, but had intimated at the same time that we were prepared to pay any reasonable price for it. In handing over the title-deed he said that he would prefer to make a free gift of it to Government, an offer which, subject to the approval of Government, I accepted with thanks. It is probably worth about 700 rupees.i 6 y (Enclosure No. 1.) Memorandum of demands made liy the Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf upon Sheikh Isa bin Alt. Chief of Bahrein, by order of the Government of India. I am desired, first, to remind you of the long continued friendship and support which have been accorded by the British Government to the rulers of Bahrein. 2 . I have need to remind you that these favours have also been extended to you personally. Upon the death of your father, Sheikh Ali bin Khalifah, the British Government caused the usurper Muhammad bin Abdulla to be expelled and yourself installed in your father’s place. You have ever since received the support of the British Government. 3. In Eebruary 1901, you were notified by the Resident that, in accordance with your express wish the British Government recognised your son, Shaikh Hamed, as your successor to the Chieftainship. 4. They further offered you the services of a British Officer to administer with more efficiency the customs of Bahrein. This offer you refused. 5. These are evidences of the friendly and benevolent spirit which has been consistently displayed towards you by the British Government. You owe, in the main, to them your present position, the means that you enjoy and your continued occupation of the Chieftainship. 6 . Notwithstanding these facts, and notwithstanding the assurances 'which have been given by you, especially on the occasion of the imprisonment in 1873 of a mail agent in the employ of a British Trading Company, when you promised to abide “ Inshalla ” by the advice of the Political Resident, you have not maintained your friendship towards the British Government and have con ducted yourself in a manner which cannot be permitted to continue. 7. Y'ou have now refused to accept advice which I have repeatedly offered on behalf of the British Government with a view to the amicable settlement of the difficulties which have arisen in connection with the recent assault by sub jects of yours on certain Persians. The final reply given by you, when I last visited you on the 8 th December 1904, was to the following effect: “ I have only one answer to give, namely, that I will do nothing in this case except after trial by my own Shariat or Urf Court”. You were then informed why this procedure could not be agreed to, and, though every consideration was shown to you, you still remained obdurate, and thus barred the way to a satisfactory conclusion being arrived at. You have also in spite of my own repeated re presentations and those of the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, Captain Prideaux, entirely failed to keep under proper control your nephew, Shaikh Ali, who has undoubtedly been identified through his retainers with the present out rage on Persians, as well as with the recent attack on the German, Mr. Bahnson for the illegal application of Sukhra, or forced labour, on the employes of the German, Mr. Wonckhaus and for the forcible removal from the British Mail Steamer Kangra of certain baggalas last December for his own work. 8 . Matters have now come to a point when the British Government can no longer consistently with their own dignity and your permanent interests discuss these matters with you, and I am, therefore, instructed to make the followin'* demands upon you : — (I) I am to demand that six of the ring-leaders in the attack against Persian subjects shall, after identification, be expelled from the island, and with them the 4 persons whom you expelled in connection with the German case, but who 1 learn have returned. (II) I am to demand that Rs. 2,000 shall be paid as compensation to the Persians through the Assistant Political Agent, on account of the outrage committed on them. (Ill) I am to demand that you shall station a special guard of your own trusted men on duty in Manama to maintain order in th§ Bazaar.(IV) I am to demand that Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed shall leave Bahrein forthwith, and that he shall not be permitted to return there for period of five years counting from the date on which he now leaves Bahrein. (Y) I am to demand that the existing system of “ Shukra ” or forced labour shall be stringently prohibited as far as employes of foreigners are concerned, and that a public notification to that effect shall be issued in terms to be approved by me. (YI) Finally, I am to warn you that further rejection of advice in im portant matters will not be tolerated by Government, and that in the event of any continuance or repetition of an unfriendly attitude on your part, all support and assistance, whether diplomatic or military, which you and your predecessors have enjoyed, will be withdrawn from you and may possibly take another direction. It is impossible for the British Government to continue their support and protection to a Chief who continues obdurate to all reasonable advice for his welfare, and assumes an unfriendly attitude towards their officers. These are the demands of which Government has instructed me to exact compliance. It will be necessary for you to comply with them by 9 a.M. to-morrow in the following manner:— ( 1 ) Firstly, you w 7 ill yourself meet me at 9 a.m. at the Agency, bringing with you one of the copies of these terms signed and sealed by yourself as a proof that you have accepted the said terms. ( 2 ) Secondly, you will bring with you at the same time a sum of Es. 2,000 contained in tw~o bags of Es. 1,000 each. (3) Thirdly, the following 10 individuals, namely :—(1) Hassan Baluch, ( 2 ) Mahomed Tahir, (3) Zaeed bin Saad, (4) Zaeedbin Ferhan, (5) Bakhit el Nubi, ( 6 ) Marzook bin Ismail, (7) Saad Kahtani, ( 8 ) Almas, (9) Miyelli, (10) Baraitch bin Zaeed are to be sent by you at the same hour to the .Agency. 'They will proceed straight from the Agency on to one of the men-of-war which will convey them to Maskat wffiere they will be detained for a certain time, their maintenance expenses w hile at Maskat being paid by yourself. (4) Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed who, by the orders of Government, wull be exiled from Bahrein for a period of five years, will also present himself at 9 a.m. at the Agency with two or three private servants who will accompany him; he will likewise proceed forthwith on to one of the men-of-war for conveyance to Maskat, where he will remain pending issue of orders or permission by Governmant for his departure to another place. (5) It will be necessary for you to publish !a notice with regard to t£ Sukhra ” and to bring with you a draft of it for inspection and approval by me before promulgation. ( 6 ) Ycu must appoint 50 men from among your own reliable followers for the guarding of the Manama Bazaar to be under the orders of the Bazaar Master, and Captain Prideaux, British Agent, will be at liberty to call upon the Bazaar Master to muster the men before him at such times as he may desire, in order that he may verify their numbers. All the above conditions must be fulfilled by you by 9 a.m. on 26th Feb ruary, and after the expiry of the time now given no further law will be allowed you. Accordingly, in order that you may have due warning one hour before the expiry of the time, that is to say, at 8 a.m., each of the three men-of-war will fire one blank charge, so that you may know that there is only one more hour left of the time allowed to you for compliance. In addition to this, a man-of-war’s boat will remain on duty off the Muharrug Customs House in order to bring me any communication from you in the above connection, and this boat will stay there until the last moment possible.! 8 As soon as the hoar of 9 o’clock hns passed, the boat will return to its man-of-war, and after that no further opportunity for communication will exist. The above demands were presented and thoroughly explained by me to Sheikh Isa bin Ali this day, 25th February 1905, in the presence of Captain J. B. Eustace, R.N., Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, and Captain F. B. Prideaux, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein. P. Z. COX, Major, Offg.

To all whom it may concern be it known that “ Sukhra ” or forced labour is not applicable in any way whatever to the employes or coolies of merchants who are foreign subjects.

Major Cox, as defined in the instructions given to him by the Government of India, which were received from His Majesty’s Government. 2. Captain Eustace appears to have so disposed his flotilla that the Sheikh Esa was overawed, and complied with the demands, although he appears to have allowed his nephew, Sheikh Ali, and Mullah Achmed, a turbulent priest, to escape. 3. 1 consider that Captain Eustace and the officers and men under him carried out a dififieuit task with forethought, firmness, and forbearance, and brought a trouble some difference with Sheikh Esa and the Mullah to a satisfactory, because peaceful, solution. 4. The Sheikh is a weak old Chief, and was much under the influence of Sheikh Ali and Mullah Achmed, both of whom fled from Bahrein into the country bordering A1 Katr. (Signed) GEORGE L. ATKINSON-WILLES, Rear-Admiral, Commander-in-chief. Inclosure 2 in No. 1 . Captain Eustace to Rear-Admiral Atkinson-Willes. Sir, “ Fox,” at Bahrein, March 2, 1905. I HAVE the honour to inform you that in accordance with your telegraphic orders of the 19th February, 1905,1 left Bushire on the 20 th, and anchored off Bahrein on the 21 st. His Majesty’s ship “ Sphinx ” was found at anchor off Manamah. On the 22nd I weighed and anchored in the outer harbour. His Majesty’s ship “ Redbreast ” arrived at 5 p.m. on the 23rd with Major P. Z. Cox, C,I.E., Political Resident to the Persian Gulf, who landed under a salute of thirteen guns from His Majesty’s ship “ Sphinx ” at 7 p.m. 2 . A salute of five guns was fired by the shore battery at Manamah, under the misapprehension that Sheikh had called upon the Resident; he, however, paid his first visit at 8 a.m. on the 24th, at the Residency, Manamah, when he was informed by Major Cox that he was wanted at 9 a.m. on the 25th to hear a message from the British Government. 3. On the 25th February the demands of the British Government were presented, and their tenour explained to Sheikh Esa at the Residency, Manamah, by Major Cox, copy attached. [1944 d—3] B4. At p.m. Sheikh Eaa requested Major Cox to help him to surround Sheikh All’s ho’-se. This was promptly done, and an armed cutter to cover them was sent to “lay off” All’s house. It was then found (5 p.m.) that Ali had fled at noon, after a visit paid to him by his brother-in-law, Abdullah-bin-Esa. His half brother Hamid- hin-Esa, did not return from his garden near Ar Ttufa until the evening of the 2 oth, and subsequent inquiries showed that Ali had fled to Ar Kufa, of which fortress his^ uncle K ha lid is the Governor. . „ , . _ ,. T pr . J It was generally believed that Ali did not finally quit Bahrein for A1 Katr until thi 28th. His uncle Khalid arrived at Manamah at 10 a.m on the 26th, but despite a nig-ht spent in chasing Ali (according to Sheikh Esa), he looked quite fresh, and only apparently desirous of hood-winking us. ! can hardly believe that had Esa gone at once to Ali’s house on receipt of the ultimatum on the 25th, he could not have detained him and the ten men, the majority of whom were followers of Ali. 5. At 8 a.m. on the 26th, each ship fired a blank charge, which was clearly seen by the towns of Manamah and Muharrag. At S’SO Sheikh Esa arrived at the Agency with two bags of 1,000 rupees each, and a draft of his proposed notice on the “ Sukhra question. He stated “ That despite all he could do, Ali and the ten men had left. He, however, failed to convince me that he had shown any hearty desire to detain them, and throughout the interview adopted a von possumus attitude. 6 . The fact that Sheikh Esa had to some extent complied with our terms materially changed the situation ; but. as he had also shown a considerable amount of ignorance, almost amounting to bad faith, and an intention to delay a settlement, the following further terms were then given to him :— (i.) That Sheikh Hamid should go on board a man-of-war, and remain there a,s a mark of good faith, pending the capture of Ali, and the settlement of the original terms. j x iv/r u u (ii.) To prevent delays. Sheikh Esa should reside at Manamah instead of Mu bar ran, during the visit of the Political Resident to Bahrein. (iii.) Sheikh Ali’s town house, furniture, boats, and animals should be given to the British Government. (Copy attached.) Item iii) was agreed to after some demur, but numbers (i; and (ii) were only agreed to by a threat to open fire, and the destruction of all forts within an hour, unless Sheikh Hamid voluntarily surrendered. Upon his surrender at noon (26th), he w ? as taken on board His Majesty’s ship “ Sphinx ” by Commander Bowman, where he was allowed to employ four of his own domestics, and to see his friends at certain hours. Sheikh Esa came over to Manamah on the 27th at 8'30 a.m., and lived with his son Abdullah, during the remainder of our stay at Bahrein. 7- His proximity to the Agency greatly facilitated all subsequent transactions, and prevented any delay which bad weather, by stopping communications between the islands, might have caused. His presence at Manamah also enabled pressure to be promptly applied to the Sheikhs or others who tried to obstruct us, or who declined to carry out our wishes. At a port where shoals and reefs only permit of three hours’ work a day near the shore, any obstruction that can be made by sheikhs or others, who refer you to a ruler resident at Muharrag, causes the loss of a tide, and is most prejudicial to business— e.g., on the 28th, when shipping Ali’s camels, &amp;c., the nakhodasof the dhows refused to move until specific orders were given by Sheikh Esa to do so. 8 . Sheikh Abdullah was sent by Sheikh Esa to clear out the women and servants from Ali’s house in Manamah on the 26th, which was then handed over to a guard of sepoys, a company of marines being landed to surround the house while this took place and withdrawn at sunset. On the 27 th Sheikh Esa proclaimed Ali as an outlaw, and on the 28th his house w T as emptied, while his dhow and boat were burnt as a warning to the other Sheikhs. 9. A reward of 10,000 rupees was offered by Sheikh Esa for the apprehension of Sheikh Ali, and his delivery to any Political officer or man-of-war in the Persian Gulf, in order to prevent his intriguing with hostile Chiefs, or from carrying out piratical attacks upon the local traders. 10. Mullahs Jasim and Achmed were summoned to appear before Major Cox on the 27 ih, but despite an order from Sheikh Esa to do so, and a promise of sate conduct, Achmed fled, and only Jasim appeared on the 27th. 11 . Mullah Jasim (often called locally “ Sheikh”), however, paid several visits to Major Cox, and eventually to save his brother Achmed from being outlawed, gave .3 himself up as a hostage, and was sent to &lt;c Sphinx” for safe custody. When on board her he at once took precedence of Sheikh Hamid (Esa’s son, and recognized successor), and in the two interviews I held, treated Hamid with scant ceremony. 12. Mullah Achmed’s house was surrounded by marines on the 1 st March after the women had been removed, but it was found to contain little else than books, so was left undisturbed. , i 13. On the 28th the new police force at Manamah were mustered neai tne psidency for Captain Prideaux’ inspection. Their pay was then settled, sergeants selected/and their duties explained The bazaar master, however, disclaimed all responsibility for breaches of the peace committed by sheikhs or their followers, and stated that Sheikh Esa had appointed another person to look after them. 14. At 8-30 a.m. on the 2nd March, accompanied by Major Cox, I called ui on Sheikh Esa to say good-bye. We then met his son Abdullah and grandson (the eldest son of late Sheikh Salamah), also his brother Khalid, the Governor of Ar Rufa, he visit was a purelv formal one, and Sheikh Esa bad no complaints to make, nor news to give us of the persons that had fled. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) J. B. EUSTACE, Captain and Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division,, Inclosure 3 in No. 1. Memorandum, of Demands made by the Officiating Political Resident m the Persian Gulf upon Sheikh Esa-bin-AH, Chief of Bahrein, by order of the Government of India, February 25, 1905. I AM desired first to remind you of the long continued friendship and support which have been accorded by the British Government to the Rulers of Bahrein. 2 . I have next to remind you that these favours have also been extended to you personally. . . Upon the death of vour father, Sheikh Ali-bin-Khalifah, the British Government caused the usurper, Muhammed-bin-Abdullah to be expelled, and yourself installed in your father’s place. You have ever since received the support of the British Government. 3 . In February 1901 you were notified by the Resident that, in accordance with your express wish, 'the British Government recognized your son, Sheikh Hamid, as your successor to the Chieftainship. 4. They further offered you the services of a British officer to administer with more efficiency the customs of Bahrein. This offer you refused. 5 . These are evidences of the friendly and benevolent spirit which has been con sistently displayed towards you by the British Government. You owe, in the main, to them your present position, the means that you enjoy, and your continued occupation of the Chieftainship. 6 . Notwithstanding these facts, and notwithstanding the assurances which have been given by you, especially on the occasion of the imprisonment in 1873 of a mail agent in the employ of a British trading Company, when you promised to abide “ Inshalla ” by the advice of the Political Resident, you have not maintained your friendship towards the British Government, and have conducted yourself in a manner which cannot he permitted to continue. 7 . You have now refused to accept advice which 1 have repeatedly offered on behalf of the British Government, with a view to the amicable settlement of the difficulties which have arisen in connection with the recent assault by subjects of yours on certain Persians. The final reply given by you when I last visited you on the 8 th December, 1904, was to the following effect: “ I have only one answer to give, namely, that I will do nothing in this case except after trial by my own Shariat-ar-Urf Court.” You were then informed why this procedure could not be agreed to, and though every consideration was shown to you, you still remained obdurate, and thus barred the way to a satisfactory conclusion being arrived at. You have also, in spite of my own repeated representa tions and those of the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, Captain Prideaux, entirely failed to keep under proper control your nephew, iSheikh Ah, who has undoubtedly been4 irl H identified through |his retainers with the present outrage on Persians, as well as the recent attack on the German, M. Bahnson, for the illegal application of Sukhra, or forced labour, on the employes of the German, M. Wanckhaus, and for the forcible removal from the British mail steamer “ Kangra ” of a certain baggalas last December for his own work. 8 . Matters have now come to a point when the British Government can no longe consistently with their own dignity and your permanent interests, discuss these matteil with you, and I am therefore instructed to make the following demands upon you:— ( 1 .) I am to demand that six of the ringleaders in the attack against Persian subjects shall, after identification, be expelled from the island, and with them the four persons whom you expelled in connection with the German case, but who I learn have returned. ( 2 .) I am to demand that 2,000 rupees shall be paid as compensation to the Persians through the Assistant Political Agent, on account of the outrage committed on them. (3.) I am to demand that you shall station a special guard of your own trusted men on duty in Manamah to maintain order in the bazaar. (4.) I am to demand that Sheikh Ali-bin-Ahmed shall leave Bahrein forthwith, and that he shall not be permitted to return there for a period of five years, counting from the date on which he now leaves Bahrein. (5.) I am to demand that the existing system of “ sukhra,” or forced labour, shall be stringently prohibited as far as employes of foreigners are concerned, and that a public notification to that effect shall be issued in terms to be approved by me. ( 6 .) Finally, I am to warn you that further rejection of advice in important matters will not be tolerated by Government, and that, in the event of any continuance or repetition of an unfriendly attitude on your part, all support and assistance, whether diplomatic or military, which you and your predecessors have enjoyed, will be withdrawn from you, and may possibly take another direction. It is impossible for the British Government to continue their support and protection to a Chief who continues obdurate to all reasonable advice for his welfare, and assumes an unfriendly attitude towards their officers. These are the demands of which the Government has instructed me to exact compliance. It will be necessary for you to comply with them by 9 a.m. to-morrow in the following manner :— 1 . You will yourself meet me at 9 a.m. at the Agency, bringing with you one of the copies of these terms, signed and sealed by yourself, as a proof that you have accepted the said terms. 2 . You will bring with you at the same time a sum of 2,000 rupees, contained in two bags of 1,000 rupees each. 3. The following ten individuals, namely:— ( 1 .) Hassam Baluch, ( 2 .) Mahomed Tahir, (3.) Zaced-bin-Saad, (4.) Zaced-bin-Ferhan, (5.) Bakheet-el-Ifubi, ( 6 .) Mar Zook-bin-lsmail, (7.) Saad Kahtani, ( 8 .) Alma, (9.) Miyelli, ( 10 .) Baraitch-bin-Zaeed, are to be sent by you at the same hour to the Agency. They will proceed straight from the Agency on to one of the men-of-war, which will convey them to Muscat, where they will be detained for a certain time, their maintenance expenses while at Muscat being paid by yourself. 4. Sheikh Ali-bin-Ahmed, who, by the orders of Government, will be exiled from Bahrein for a period of five years, will also present himself at 9 a 4 m. at the Agency, with two or three private servants, who will accompany him ; he will likewise proceed forthwith on to one of the men-of-war for conveyance to Muscat, where he will remain pending issue of orders or permission by Government for his departure to another place.5. It will be necessary for you to publish a notice with regard to “ Sukhra,” and to bring with you a draft ot it for inspection and approval by me before promulgation. 6 . You must appoint fifty men from among your own reliable followers for the guarding of the Manamah bazaar, to be under the orders of the bazaar master; to muster the men before him at such times as he may desire, in order that he may verify heir numbers. All the above conditions must be fulfilled by you by 9 a.m. on the 26th February, and after the expiry of the time now given, no further law will be allowed you. Accordingly, in order that you may have due warning, one hour before the expiry of the time, that is to say, at 8 a.m., each of the three men-of-war will fire one blank charge, so that you may know that there is only one more hour left of the time allowed to you for compliance.

As soon as the hour of 9 o’clock has passed, the boat will return to its man-of-war, and after that no further opportunity for communication will exist.

Captain Eustace to Rear-Admiral Atkinson-Willes. Sir, “ Fox,” at Bombay, March 10, 1905. I HAVE the honour to submit a report on the proceedings of His Majesty’s ships “Fox,” “ Sphinx,” and “ Redbreast ” at Bahrein, between the 22 nd February and the 2nd March, 1905. From information obtained from Lieutenant and Commander Hugh G. Somerville, it appeared that on Muharrak Island Sheikh Esa controlled 540 men armed with Martini rifles, while a large number of men armed with Arab guns might be expected to join him on Bahrein Island. If Sheikh Ali joined hands with his uncie Khalid, the Governor of Ar Rufa, he could place against us 500 riflemen, and a large body of men armed with native weapons. The town of Muharrak is of considerable extent, with a labyrinth of small streets. Sheikh Esa usually resides there during the winter, in a house 600 yards distant from the usual landing-place. The population of Muharrak is entirely Arab, and no foreigners live there. [1944 d—3 n C1 s ’ 9 Miuiainali is the business and residential town for all foreigners m Bahrein while Sheikh Esa resides there during the summer months. Sheikh Ah, who c aims the Governorship of this town, lives in a large rambhng house, with several courtyards on the sea-front. The fanatical Mullahs, Jasim and Achmed, also live there, while nearly every important house in Manamah belongs to a Sheikh, or member of the Utubi In both towns are a large number of huts and mat-sheds, hence it is impossible tl shell either, if a general conflagration is to be avoided. Since all those whom we might have to protect live scattered about in the town of Manamah, 1 deemed it necessary to detail the “ Sphinx ” and all marines to co-operate with the Resident guard tor their protection. The remainder of the “Pox” and “ Redbreast’’crews were under orders to destroy Forts Bu Mahir, Arad, and Manamah on the signal being made to commence hostihties.ttain objectSj the forces of E sa and Ali were kept apart by mooring “Redbreast ” in Khor Kaliya, in such a position as to command forts Bu Mahir, Arad, and Manamah without endangering the towns. His Majesty s ship “ Sphinx was moored off Sheikh Ali’s house and in sight ot Fort Manamah, which also could be shelled without risk to the town. His Majesty’s ship “Fox” being 7,650 yards from Fort Manamah and 9,000 from Fort Arad, every available man was sent to the two former ships. Owing to bad weather, the shallow channels, and extensive reets, the maiority had to be at their posts before dark on the “25th, and slept in their blankets or great coats, until they returned to this ship on the 28th February or the 1 st March. On the 26th, at 8 a.m., a signal gun was fired by each ship to indicate that in one hour’s time hostilities would commence. ., xl , , At 8-30 Sheikh Esa arrived at the Residency, Manamah. As he evidently showed a desire to personally comply with the terms, so far as his family would permit, it was decided to coerce them, and the following measures were then undertaken 1 . The seizure of Sheikh Ali’s town house, furniture, boats, and animals. 2 . The voluntary surrender of Sheikh Hamid as a hostage and as a sign of good faith 3. That Sheikh Esa should reside at Manamah during our stay in order to facilitate any further questions that might arise. Measures 2 and 3 were strongly relented. It was only by the threat of the destruction of all forts within an hour that Sheikh Hamid eventually surrendered and was sent on board His Majesty’s ship “ Sphinx” (copy of Agreement attached). The marines were then landed and surrounded Ali’s house, which was occupied hy a sepoy’s guard as soon as the women and domestics with their personal effects had left. After darkt on the 2 fith, the marines returned to “ Sphinx,” and during the night search lights were' kept working upon the towns by “Fox ” and “Redbreast,” the want ot one was very greatly felt in the “ Sphinx.” On the 27th all Sheikh Ali’s movable property was removed from his house, and on the 28th shipped for conveyance to Koweit, Bushire, and Muscat, while his boat and dhow were burned. Since the turbulent Mullahs, Jasim and Achmed, have never called at the Residency, and were holding continuous services in their mosques, Sheikh Esa ordered them to call at once to meet the Political Resident. Mullah Achmed however fled, and his brother, Mullah Jasim, surrendered himself as a hostage, pending the return of Achmed, thus saving him from being outlawed and his property seized. The presence of a small body of marines that surrounded Mullah Achmed’s house undoubtedly expedited this matter. The authority of Sheikh Esa was, however, always requested, and his agents accompanied our working parties, while marines and sepoys covered them and overawed the mobs that gathered. , On the 2 oth Seedie Boy Maiden Haisa died at lOAo p.m., but owingto the imminence of hostilities on the 26th the interment did not take place until the 27th, when it was quietly effected at Manamah by a friendly Mullah. On the 1 st March the marine company of the landing party was broken up and the marines returned to their respective ships. Their services had been required upon four occasions. Despite wet garments due to wading on shore over the reefs, and long hours in the rain and wind, they showed an excellent spirit, and proved themselves to be a very capable body. Tue failure in several instances of the marines’ boots is the subject of a special letter, while the discomfort that the absence of the marine servants caused to their respective masters is also referred to in my Report on the question of domestics. *His Majesty’s ship “ Redbreast ” was withdrawn from the Kkor Kaliya on the 1st March, where her presence, by preventing the forces of Muharrak and Manamah from combining, conduced very materially to the peaceful termination of these operations. On the 2 nd March, all details having rejoined their respective ships, and as ajor Cox considered the presence of His Majesty’s ship “ Fox ” was no longer ecessary, I ordered Commander Bowman to resume his duties as Senior Naval Officer, 'Persian Gulf, and returned to Bombay, calling at Muscat on the 5th to coal and to land the furniture seized in Ali’s house.

On BBnd I weighed and anchored in the Outer Harbour. H.M.S. M RedDreast tt arrived at 5 p # m. on BBrd with Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident to the Persian Gulf, who landed under a salute of 1*6 guns from H.M.S. M Sphinx” at 7 p.m. 2. - A salute of 5 guns was fired by the snore battery at Manamah, under the misapprehension that Sheikh had called upon the Resident; he however paid his first visit at 8 a.m, on 24th, at the Residency, Manamah, when he was informed, by Major Cox, that he was wanted at 9 a.m, on 25th, to hear a message from the British Government. 3 . - On 25th February the Demands of the British Government were presented, and their tenour explained to Sheikh Esa at the Residency, Manamah. by Major Cox,- copy attached. 4. - At 3.45 p.m.. Sheikh Esa requested Major Cox to help him to surround Sheikh Ali*s nouse. This was promptly done, and an armed cutter to cover them, was sent to”lay off” nli’s house. It was then found (5.0 p.m.) tnat nli had fled at noon, after a visit paid to him by Ms brother-in?-law Abdul Ian bin Esa. His half brother Hamid bin Esa did not return from ear Ad iral George L. Atkinson-Willes Ms C omiuand e r-in-Chi of, EAST INDIEShis garden near Ar Rufa until the evening of R 6 th, suid subsequent enquiries shewed that Ali had fled to -tir Rufa, of which fortress his uncle Khalid is the Governor. It was generally believed that Ali did not finally quit Bahrein for Al Katr until 28th. His uncle Khalid arrived at Manama!) at 10.0 a.m. on 26th, but despite a night spent in Chasing nli (according to Sheikh Ksa) he looked quite fresh, and only apparently desirous of hood-winking us. I can hardly believe that had Csa gone at once to uli’s house on receipt of the ultimatum on 26th, he couldnot have detained him and the ten men, the majority of whom were followers of Ali. 5. - At 8 a.m. on 26th, each ship fired a blank charge, which was clearly seen by the towns of Manama!) and Munarrag. At 8.80 Sheikh Asa arrived at the Agenoy with two bags of l f QQ0 Rupees each, and a ^iraft of his proposed Notice on the H SukhraT question. He stated n that despite all ho could do Ali and Hhe ten men had left” - he however failed to convince me that he had shewn any hearty desire to detain them, and throug] out the interview adopted a M non possumus” attitude. 6 . - The fact that Sheikh Csa, had to some extent complied with our terms, materially changed the situation; but, as no na&lt; also shewn a considerable amount of ignorance almost amounting to bad faith, and an intention to delay a settlement, the following further terms were then given to him;- (i) Tliat Sheikh Hamid should go on board a man of war, and remain there as a mark of good faith, pending the capture of Ali, and the settlement of the original terms. (ii) To prevent delays. Sheikh Esa should reside at Manamah insteadinstoad of Muharrag, during the visit of the Poiitical Resident to Bahrein. (iii) Sheikh Ali , s town house, furniture, boats, and animals siiould be given to the British Government. ( Copy attached.) Item (iii) was agreed to after some demur, but numbers (i) anc (ii) were only agreed to by a threat to open fire, and the destruction of all forts within an hour, unless Sheikh Hamid voluntarily surrendered. Upon his surrender at noon (26th) he was taken on board H.M.S. ,, Sphinx ,t by Commander Bowman, where he was allowed to employ four of his own Dou)sties, and to see his friexids at certain hours. Sheikh hsa came over to Manamah on 27th at 6 .BO a.m. and lived with his son Abdullah, during the remainder of our stay at Bahrein. 7.- His proximity to the Agency greatly facilitated all subsequent transactions and prevented any delay, which bad weather, by stopping communications between the islands might have caused. His presence at Manamah also enabled pressure to be promptly applied to^oheikhs or others who tried to obstruct us. or, who declined to carry out our wishes. At a port where shoals and reefs only permit of three hours work a day near the shore, any obstruction that can be made by Sheikhs or others, who refer you to a ruler resident at kuharrag. causes the loss of a tine, and is most prejudicial to business - e.g. on 2 Bth when snipping aIIMs camels, etc., the tlako ias of the dhows refused to move until specific orders were given by Sheikh Esa to do so. b.-8 # - Sheikh Abdullah wag sent by Sheikh Ksa to clear out the women and servants from All's nouse in Manamah on 86 tn, which was theii handed over to a guard of Sepoys* A company of l!arines being landed to surround the house wnile tnis took place ana withdrawn at sunset. On 87th Sheikh ^.sa proclaimed *ili as an outlaw* and on 8 btn nis house was emptied, while his dhow and boat were burnt, as a warning to the other Sheikhs, 9, - A reward of 10,000 Rupees was offered by Sheikh Esa for the apprehension of Sheikh Ali, and his delivery to any Political Officer or man-of-war in the Persian Gulf: in order to prevent his intriguing with hostile Chiefs, or from carrying out piratical attacks upon the local traders, 10, - Mullahs Jasim and Achinet were summoned to appear before Mojor Cox on 87th, but despite an order from Sneikn Esa to do so, ana a promise of safe conduct, Acnmet fled, and only Jasi ; appeared on 87th, 11*- Mullah Jasim (often called locally w Sheikh H ) however paid several visits to Major Cox, and eventually to save his brother Achmet from being outlawed, gave himself up as a hostage, and was sent to ,, Sphinx ,, for safe custody. When on board her he at once took precedence of Sheikh Hamid (Esa 1 s son and recognised successor; and ia the two interviews I held* treated Hamid with scant ceremony, 18,- Mullah Achmet’s house was surrounded by Marines on 1st March after the women had been removed, but it was found to contain little else than books, so was left undisturbed, lb,-lb.- On 28th the new Police Force at Manauaii were mustered near the Residency for Captain Prideaux^ inspec tion. Their pay was then settled. Servants selected, and their duties explained. The Bazaar Master however disclaimed all responsibility for breaches of the peace committed by Sheikhs, or tiieir followers, and stated that Sheikh Csa had appointed another person to look after them. 14.- At 8.BO a.m. on 2nd March, accompanied by Major Cox, I called u r on Sheikh hsa to say G&amp;odbye, we then met his son Abdullah and grandson (tiie eldest son of late Sheikh Salamah) also his brother aviialid, the Governor of Ar Rufa. The visit was a purely for al one and Sheikh hsa had no complaints to make, nor nows to give us of the persons that had fled. I nave, etc.... J. B.

Upon the death of your Father, Sheikh Ali bin Analif ah, the British Government caused the Usurper, Mohammed bin Abdullah to bo expelled, and yourself installed in your father^ place. You have ever since received the support of the British Government. B.- In February 1901, you were notified by the Resident that, in accordance with your express wish, the British Government recognised your son. Sheikh Hamid, as your successor to the Uiieft Unship. 4. - They further offered you the services of a British Officer to ad dnister with more efficiency tne Customs of Bahrein. This offer you refused. 5. - These are evidences of the friendly and benevolent spirit which has been consistentiy displayed towards you by the British Government. You owe in the main to them your present position, the means that you enjoy, mid your continued occupation of the Chieftainship,t&gt;.- Notwithstanding tnese facts, and notwithstanding the assurances which have been given by you, especially on the occasion of the imprisonment in 187^ of a mail agent in the employ of a British Trading Co up any, when you promised to abide f, Inshalla M by the Advice of the Political Resident, you have not maintained your friendship towards the British Government, and have conducted yourself in a manner which camot be permitted to continue. 7.- You have now refused to accept advice which I have repeatedly offered on behalf of the British Government, with a view to the amicable settlement of the difficulties which have arisen in connection with tne recent assault by subjects of yours on certain Persians. The final reply given by you when I last visited you on the 8 th December 1004, was to the following effect:- W I have only one 'answer to give, namely, that I will do nothing in this 'case oxcept after trial by my own Shariat ar Urf Court'. You were then informed why tills procedure could not be agreed to, and, though every consideration was shewn to you, you still regained obdurate, and thus barred the way t( a satisfactory conclusion being arrived at. You nave also in spite of my own repeated representations and those of the Assistant Political iigent at Bo.hrein, Captain Prideaux, entirely failed to keep under proper control your nephew. Sheikh Ali, who has undoubtedly been identi fied through his retainers with the present outrage on Persians, as well as the recent attack on the German, Mr Bahnson, for the illegal application of Sukhra, or forced labour, on the employes of the German, Mr Wanckhaus, and forfor the forcible removal from the British Mail Steamer 'Rangra” of a certain baggalas last December for his own work. 8 .- Matters have now cone to a point when the British Government can no longer, consistently with their o n dignity and your permanent interests, discuss these natters with you, ana I am tnerefore instructed to make the following demands upon you:- a) I am to aemand that six of the ringleaders in the attack against Persian subjects snail, after identifica tion, bo expelled from the Island, and with them the 4 persons whom you expelled in connection with tne German case, but who I learn have returned. (2) I am to demand that J 10 Q 0 liupecs shall be paid as compensation to the Persians through the distant Political Agent, on account of the outrage committed on them. ( 8 ) I am to demand that you shall station a special guard of your own trusted men on duty in Manama to maintain order in the bazaar. (4) I am to demand that Shoikh Ali Din Ahmed shall leave Banrein forthwith, and that he shall not be permitted to return there for a period of 5 yeaj?s, counting from the date on which he now leaves Bahrein. (5) I am to demand that the existing system of 'Sukhra' or forced labour snail be stringently prohobited as far as ei^loyes of foreigners are concerned, and that a publicnotification to tnat effect shall bo issued in tonus to bo approved by mo. (‘i) Finally, I am to warn you that further rejection of advice in important matters will not be tolerated by Government, and that, in the event of any continuance or repetition of an unfriendly attitude on your part, all support and assistance, whether diplomatic or military, which you and your predecessors have enjoyed, will be withdrawn from you, and may possirly take another direction It is impossible for the British Government to con tinue their support and protection to a Chief wno continues obdurate to all reasonable advice for his welfare, and assumes an unfriendly attitude towards tneir Officers* These are the demands of which Government has instructed me to exact compliance. It will be necessary for you to comply with them by 9 a.m. tomorrow in the following manner:- (1) Firstly you will yourself moot me at 9 a.m. at the Agency, bringing with you one of the copies of these terms signed and sealed by yourself as a proof that you have accepted the said terms. (2) Secondly you will bring with you at the same time a sum of 2000 Rupees contained in two bags of 1000 each. (*) Thirdly, the following ten individuals, namely:- Has sain Baluch Mahomed Tahir Zaced bin Saad Zaced bin Ferhan Bakheet el Nubi Mar Zook bin Ismail Saad Kahtani Alma Miyelli Baraitch bin Zaeed areare to be sent by you at trie same xiour to tne Agency.

H.M.S. ^Fox 11 at Bombay, 10th March 1905. Sir, I have the honour to submit a report on the proceedings of H. M. Ships 'Fox”, 'Sphinx' and 'Redbreast' at Bahrein, between RRnd February and Bad March 1905. From information ootained from Lieutenant and Commander Hugh G. Somerville, it appeared that on Muharrak Island, Sheikh Esa controlled 540 men armed with Martini Rifles, while a large number of men armed with Arab guns, might be expected to join him on Bahrein Island - if Sheikh Ali joined hands with his uncle Khalid, the Governor of nr Rufa, he could place against us 500 Riflemen, and a large body of men armed with native weapons. The town of Muharrak is of considerable extent, with a labyrinth of small streets. Sneikh Esa usually x^esides there during the winter, in a house 600 yards distant from the usual landing place. The population of Muharrak is entirely Arab and no foreigners live tnere. Manamah, is the business and residential town for all foreigners in Bahrein: while Sneikh Esa resides there during the summer months. Sheikh Ali, who claims the Governorship of this town lives in a large rambling house, with several court-yards on the sea iont. Tne fanatical Mullahs Jasim and Achmed also live tnere, while nearly every important nouse in Manamah belongs to a Sheikh, or Atkinson-Willes Commander-in-Chie f east indies. membermember of the Utubi tribe. In both towns are a large number of huts and mat-sheds, hence it is impossible to shell either, if a general conr- flagration is to be avoi iod. Since all those whom we right have to protect, live scattered about in the town of Manamah, I doomed it necessary to detail the ^ophiiiz 1 * a/ri all teriiies to co-operate with tne hesident*! guard for their protection. Tne remainder of the w Fox M and ,t Redbreast” crews were under orders to destroy forts. Bu Mahir, Arad, and Manamah, on the signal being made to commence hoatilities* To attain these objects, tne forces of hsa and nli were kept apart by mooring ”Redbreast” in /vhor Kaliya, in such a position as to command Forts Bu Maiiir, Arad and Manamah without endangering the towns. IU .S. ”Sphinx” was moored off Sheilh nli 1 s house and in sight of Fort Manamah, which also could be shelled without risk to the town. H.M.S. ”Fox” being 7650 yards from Fort Manaman and 9000 from Fort Arad, every available man was sent to the two former Snips. Owing to bad weather, tne snallow enannels, and extensive reefs, the majority had to be at their posts before dark on 25th, and slept in their blankets or great coats, until they retuned to this Ship on 26th February or 1st March. On 26th at 6 a.m. a signal gun was fired by each Ship to indicate that in one hour f s time. Hostilities would commence. At 6.60 Sheikh Esa arrived at the Residency, Manamah.As he evidently shewed a desire to personally comply with the terms, so far as ids family would permit, it was decided to coerce them, and the following measures were then under taken:- (i) The seizure of Sheikh Mi’s town house, furniture, boats and animals. (ii) The voluntary surrender of Sheikh Hanid as a Hostage, and as a sign of good faith. (iii) That Sheikh hsa, should reside at Manama^ during our stay, in order to facilitate any further ques tions tnat might arise. Measures (ii) and (iii) were strongly resented: it was only by the threat of the destruction of all Forts within an hour, that Sheikh Hamid eventually surrendered, and was sent on board H. M. S. 'Sphinx' - copy of agreement attached The Marines were then landed and surrounded Ali’s House; which was occupied by a Sepoy’s guard, as soon as the women and domestics with their persoiial effects had left. After dark on the H 6 th the Marines returned to 'Sphinx' and during tne nignt, search-lights were kept working upon the towns oy 'Fox' and 'Redbreast' - the want of one was very greatly felt in the 'Sphinx'. On 27th all Sheikh Ali’s movable property was removed from his house, and on 28th Shipped for conveyance to Koweit, Bushire, and Muscat, while his boat and dhow were burned # Since the turbulent Mullahs Jasim and Achmed had never called at the Residency, and were holding continuous ser vices-to. 'Ls ; servicas in their Mosques, Sheikn Ksa ordered theui to call at once to meet the Political riesident. Mullah Aciuaed however fled, and his brother Mullah Jasim surrendered hiioself as a hostage, pending the return of Achmed, thus saving him from being outlawed, and his property seized. The presence of a small body of Marines that surrounded Mullah Aehmed^ house, undoubtedly ex pedited this matter. The authority of Sheikh Asa was however always requested and his agents accompanied our working parties, while Marines and Sepoys covered them, and overawed tne mobs that ga tne red. On 25th Seedie Boy Maiden Haisa, died at 10 .&lt;*5 p.m. but owing to the eminence of hostilities oa 26th the interment did not take place until 27th, when it was quietly effected at Manamah, by a friendly Mullah. On 1st March the Marino Company of the landing party was broken up and the Marines returned to their respective Snips. Their services had been required upon four occasions: despite wet garments due to wading on shore over the reefs, and long hours in the rain and wind, they shewed an excellent spirit, and proved themselves to be a very capable body.

Captain Prideaux had been asked for his opinion in regard to your elegram No. 85-E. B., dated the 6th January 1905, and in the event of the Jheikh refusing to comply with the order of Government, my reply thereto suggested that the following threats might be tried prior to the ultimate one of bombarding Muharrag: first, that our recognition of his son as heir apparent may be withdrawn; second, that troops may be located in Bahrein at the expense of the Sheikh or of ourselves; third that pending liquidation a heavy fine with partial control over revenue may be imposed. The first I agree with, but doubt whether it would have much effect by itself. I see no advantage in the second except that so far it may prove absolutely necessary for the safety of the European community. The third involves control over Customs and would entail the location of troops also unless the Sheikh were first subdued. In any case we might use the first threat incidentally, but I think that the threat to shell the Sheikh’s residence in Muharrag if he does not comply within a specified time, will be simplest plan and will prove sufficient. Captain Prideaux also suggests consideration of the possible expediency of the expulsion of the two troublesome Mullas. I doubt the wisdom of demanding their expulsion now, but they might be warned to be Telegram P., dated the 17th (received 18th) January 1905. ” From —His Excellency Rear-Admiral G. L.

Please refer to Major Cox’s letters Nos. 420, 421 and 427, dated the 17th and 24th December 1904, copies of which were sent with the Poreian Secretarv’s letter, dated the 5th January 1905. In our opinion the incidents reported therein justify and require vigorous measures with the Sheikh whom our continued forbearance only confirms in his obstinacy. In our Ues- natcb* dated the 21st April 1904, the Sheikh’s contumacious attitude over the . No 74 i n Customs reform was explained, and he has, apart from the present cases, shown Sec.B., May himself indifferent to the advice of the new Political Agent. The appeals Nos 72 _ 74&gt; i which we have received from German and Persian subjects for our assistance minimise the objections of an international character and make the present opportunity specially fayourable for asserting our protectorate. We propose to require the Sheikh— (1) to comply with the three demands mentioned in enclosure No. 9 of Major Cox’s letter No, 421. (2) to banish Sheikh Ali for five years, (3) to notify the abolition of Sukhra so far as employes of foreigners are concerned. _ T-n n later renort Major Cox expresses the belief that the Sheikh will comply with our demands if they are adequately supported without the actual use o/foree. After consulting Bear-Admiral Atkinson Willes we propose the despatch of His Majesty’s ships Fox and Sphinx and to reinforce H.M.8. Bedbreast which is already at Bahrein. . , „ .

I would suggest that I may, in these circumstances, be given dis cretion to remove one or both brothers, if necessary.

Please refer to your telegram Bo.85, dated the 6th January 1905. I think that the arrangement proposed for the End February will meet the case on the supposition that Captain Prideaux is provided by that time with h-^s sepoy guard which I can temporarily augment from here if necessary. The Sheikh has now had time to consider his position deliberately and when he sees that we are prepared to force compliance with our demands he will in all probability comply, but in any case it will be prudent to retain one ship there for some little time after the incident is closed. I do not favour any preliminary threat regarding the seizure of the customs but recommend that if our present demands are not complied with by the Sheikh forthwith, he should be threatened with immediate bombardment of Mroharrag and that a strong detach ment of seamen should, if that contingency arises, be sent ashore to Manama in order to protect the European community during bombardment and simultaneously to seize the customs house which latter would only be handed back with a British officialofficial in charge. I think that the Sheikh might, in any case when our present demands have been exacted, be plainly warned that any further rejection of their advise in important matters will not be tolerated by the Government of India. If such a warning Is given it may have the effect of causing the Sheikh to accept the advice of the Political Agent regarding the customs when next preferred after a convenient interval of time.

From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of my telegram, “ Bahrein Affairs, No. 1 , ” dated 12th instant, I have the honour to submit a full report regarding the recent case of assault by Bahrein subjects upon a German trader at that port—Mr. Bahnson— the local representative of Herr Wonckhaus, a gentleman with whose name the Government of India are, I think, familiar. 2. Before the ensuing paragraphs are considered, I solicit perusal of the preliminary correspondence in the case, contained in enclosures 1 to 14. It will be noticed that the two recent Bahrein incidents involving ( 1 ) an assault on a German trader, and (2) an alleged attack on Persian subjects by Arabs and Negroes of Bahrein, are so far connected in that Sheikh Ah or his rowdy followers are more or less implicated in both; but as the former case has been provisionally settled by me ad referendum^ it seems preferable to keep the record of it separate as far as practicable from that of the second incident which may have to be dealt with independently. 3. What transpired up to the date of my return from tour and arrival at Bahrein may be summarised as follows :— On 29th September occurred the assault upon Mr. Bahnson and certain of his employes, by the followers of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed, nephew of the Sheikh of Bahrein. Sheikh Ali himself was also partially concerned. On that date Mr. Gaskin was still our representative at Bahrein. He inquired into the matter on the spot, made certain recommendations or demands upon the Sheikh for the suitable punishment of the offenders and reported the ascertained facts of the case and his own action thereon to the Residency on 1 st October. The SheiKh of Bahrein took no immediate action whatever in the direction of the punishment or detention of any of those concerned, but contented himself with despatching to the Residency by the same mail a communication in which he took up the cudgels in his nephew’s behalf and preferred a counter-complaint against the German (enclosures 3 and 4). 4. In the meanwhile Captain F. B. Prideaux was on his way from India to relieve Mr. Gasidn at B ahrein and was met en 'route by a communication from my Assistant, Captain Trevor, instructing him to take up the matter on arrival and endeavour to effect a settlement (enclosure 5). It was unfortunate that a case of this nature should have occurred just as one officer was leaving and another taking over charge. Captain Prideaux was naturally obliged to depend on second hand information and, at first, arrived at conclusions (on information and premises which he afterwards realised to be biassed) considerably at variance with those formed by his predecessor. I merely mention this fact in order to dismiss it, for it will be noticed that on a closer acquaintance with Bahrein affairs, Captain Prideaux altogether altered his views and then even went a step further in his conclusions and recommendations as to punishment, than did Mr. Gaskin (enclosure 12). 5 . The result, however, of his first impression was that he entered into communication with Herr Wonckhaus (enclosures 8 and 9) and that the latter not considering the terms of settlement offered by Captain Prideaux to be adequate informed that officer on 30th October that he had referred the corre spondence to the Consular representative of the German Government at Bushire, and would leave himself in that official’s hands. This was a course bearing considerable political significance. The Imperial German Consul at Bushire made no reference on the subject to my locum tenens, but addressed the Sheikh of Bahrein direct, and the latter, under Captain Prideaux* guidance, gave him a very suitable reply (enclosure 11). 'What, if any, further action my German colleague took on receiving the Sheikh’s answer I have not ascertained. Meanwhile on 5th November another complaint was preferred by Herr Wonckhaus against an employe of the Chief’s 3293 F. D.2 son ancj recognised heir, Sheikh Hamed bin Esa ; the basis of it being a similar attempt to impress coolie labour, as that which had given rise to the assault on Mr. Bahnson a month before (enclosure 10). 6 . Sheikh Isa and Captain Prideaux being unable to arrive at any uni formity of views in the matter, it was agreed between them that it should await settlement pending my arrival which was expected at no distant date (enclosure 3 and elsewhere). 7. Meanwhile on 14th November occurred the second incident ; that of an affray between a number of Arab and Negro subjects of the Sheikh and a sec tion of the small community of His Majesty the Shah’s subjects residing in Bahrein for purposes of trade, in the course of which two Persians very nearly lost their lives and seven others were more or less damaged. The Sheikh, as will be seen from the correspondence, having failed to take any particular steps in the matter the Persians sent across to Bushire a tele gram addressed to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, a translation of whose reply forms enclosure No. 13 ; and as rowdyism was still rife in the Manama Bazaar, and the Persians refused to open their shops, Captain Trevor was able to arrange for the despatch of H M.S. Redbreast to Bahrein on 27th November as a precautionary measure. Matters were at this stage when I arrived at Bushire from the Karun on 29th November and having been posted in the details by my Assistant, I left without disembarking for Bahrein. Prom this point I think what follows can be preferably related in diary form. 8 . November 30^.--Arrived Bahrein at noon. Captain Prideaux and the Sheikh came off to the Lawrence to interview me. They arrived separately and I saw Captain Prideaux first for a few moments. I learnt from him that just before the arrival of the Redbreast a few days previously, Sheikhs Ali bin Ahmed, and Hamed bin Esa, with their followers, had proceeded together to the mainland, ostensibly for purposes of shikar, and were still absent. Except for this fact there was no change in the position as last reported, and the Persian shops remain closed. I then received the Sheikh’s visit. After exchanging with him the usual greetings and after some conversation on general topics, I explained to him that having heard of the two recent incidents at Bahrein, on reaching civilization I had come straight over without landing at Bushire with a view to settling them without delay and was consequently somewhat exercised to learn from Captain Prideaux that Sheikh Ali and his followers, apparently the principal persons concerned, had been permitted to absent themselves from Bahrein indefinitely; especially as it was known that I should arrive in a few days. In reply Sheikh Esa assured me that the party had only gone for purposes of sport and were expected back at any moment; at all events he would at once send a messenger after them and get them back forthwith. I inquired whether it was usual for members of his family to undertake extensive huntino* trips during the exhausting fast of the month of Ramzan and added that I bego-ed e would take effective steps to insure their early return in order that I might be enabled to settle the two outstanding cases expeditiously. Esa p ™^ 86 * 1 . to comply but went on to observe that Sheikh Ali and his followers were only implicated in the first case, and that pending their ^khT^ h°!l ® eco ^. cas ® be P roceede d wi th ? He went onto say that Sheikh Ah had had nothing to do with the later incident, and that Captain Prideaux had only heard the Persian version, and suggested that if I would lnt0 the case ^ self I ^ould find that it was all the fault of the This assertion as to Sheikh Ali’s non-connection with the second incident ”“ eDt Wit, i Poli tical Agent’s report, but IsimpTy 'plL l to he to dispose of the bef - bim inthe seccmd 3 “•° I&gt;eratlUO *“ that &lt;»« would g u id e ' m e M to how t„ deal with3 We then parted, I proceeding ashore to the British Agency at Manama and the Sheikh to Muharrag to despatch a messenger after the absentees. 9. December 1st .—Sheikh Ali did not return. Sheikh Esa sent to inquire whether he should call at the Agency. I replied that as Sheikh Ali had not arrived I would not trouble him to-day, but reiterated the necessity of expe diting his nephew’s return and begged that he would come over on the morrow forenoon in any case, whether his nephew had returned or not. 10. December 2nd .—Sheikh Ali still absent. Sheikh Esa came over from Muharrag about 10 a.m., and we had another lengthy interview at which Captain Prideaux was present. I thought it was now time to speak to the Chief plainly and to apprise him of my views, as time was slipping by. I told him that I had in the first instance frankly accepted his assurance that his nephew and followers were only out for a shooting excursion and that he could get them back at once, but that this was the third day of my presence in Bahrein and that he could hardly wonder if I began to suspect that their absence was preconcerted. I then went on to say that my view as to what measures it was incumbent upon him to take in regard to the German case coincided with those of Mr. Gaskin and Captain Prideaux, namely, that the ringleaders should be flogged; Bs. 1,000 paid in compensation; and that Sheikh Ali be compelled to leave Bahrein, subject to approval of Government. Sheikh Esa then entered into a Ion? demur in which he took up the cudgels for Sheikh Ali and argued that he had done nothing to deserve such punishment, as that involved by measures suggested, to all of which he demurred. This brought the specific question of Sheikh A IPs position in Bahrein into the discussion. I reminded Sheikh Esa that I had been some five years in the Gulf and that from what Sheikh Ali had himself told me at Maskat I had for long.been aware of his character and his not unnaturally disaffected attitude. I reminded Sheikh Esa that only six months ago he had, I thought, confided in Mr. Gaskin regarding his nephew’s troublesome personality and had prompted our representative to address to me a proposal * for the making of a public pronouncement in Bahrein in such plain terms that Sheikh Ali would accept it as applying to his own case, without the necessity of any specific mention of his name. I added that the idea had had my cordial approval, and that it had only awaited the advent of a more senior Political Officer at Bahrein before being taken into serious consideration. I explained to him that his present surprising attitude in championing Sheikh Ali could only convey the impression that so long as Sheikh All’s doings affected his own convenience and peace of mind injuriously, nothing was °bad enough for his nephew. He was said by his uncle to be disloyal, turbulent and most felonious in his tendencies. On the other hand, now that he was involved in an obvious offence against Europeans or others under the protective purview of the British Agency, Sheikh Esa and his son and heir were found to take his part and give him all possible support. How did he, Sheikh Esa, think the Government of India would interpret such an attitude on his part after all they had done for him ? In reply the Chief admitted his previous inward misgivings regarding Sheikh Ali, but explained that he did not fear his machinations or secret enmity now in his own lifetime but rather later on after his demise. He then repeated the arguments he had employed before in palliation of what had passed, and urged that the whole incident or incidents would be adequately met and Sheikh Ali effectively subdued by my giving him a severe talking to in the presence of his uncle and Captain Prideaux. I was unable to concur in this view, and after considerable reiteration and further discussion the Sheikh finally agreed that as soon as Sheikh Ah returned— , . , , i j j ( 1 ) The compensation money of Rs. 1,000 should be levied and lodged at the Agency. (2) The four or five ringleaders having been produced or identified should be whipped and expelled from Manama. * Firfe this office letter No. 136 of 19th May 1904 and Foreign Department No. 2067-E.A., dated 30th June 1904.4 i S (3) (4) That after the above two conditions had been aetnally fulfilled I should see Sheikh Ali in the presence of the Chief and Captain Prideanx and should warn him regarding his departure from Bahrein pending receipt of the views of Government, .^sug gested his either going on pilgrimage to Mecca or on a visit to Maskat, Lingah or Koweit. Sheikh Esa also agreed, if I so desired, to publish a notification prohibiting the custom of “Sukhra” or “employment of forced coolie labour ” by the petty Sheikhs of Bahrein. At thesame time he pointed out that he had already warned those con cerned on the subject, and that we were welcome to regard it as an accepted fact that he did not recognize the practice in any way. 11. Before separating we agreed that it was of no use our meeting again until Sheikh Ali had arrived and until the above conditions (1) and (2) had been actually put into effect. {Note.—It was necessary to decide hours of meeting a long while in advance as incle ment weather made communication between Manama and Muharrag and between the Agency and the ships exceedingly difficult and tedious all the time I was there and impeded our work very much.] 12. December 3 rd—Sheikh Ali did not return during the day, but we heard after dark that he had just returned and was spending the night with the Chief at Muharrag. December 4th .—About 8 a.m. a bag of Rs. 1,000 was received at the Agency by the hand of one of the Sheikh s men. At 10 a.m. Sheikh Esa, accompanied by • Sheikh Ali and his son, Sheikh Mamed, arrived from Muharrag. _ Xu spite of our sgreemeut of 2 nd instant tlist we would not meet until conditions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) had been fulfilled, they all obtained ingress to the Agency Reception Room and sent word to me that they had come and wanted to see me. I sent Captain Prideaux in to give Sheikh Esa my compliments and to say that the compensation money, Rs. 1,000, had arrived safely and I was much obliged for it, but that according to our previous agreement, the ringleaders had to be produced or all Sheikh All’s servants paraded for identi fication before I could have any further meeting with themselves. Captain Prideaux brought hack the reply that it was this question of the production of the ringleaders that they wished to discuss with me; they were willing it appeared to pay another Rs. 1,000 if Sheikh All’s servants could he spared the corporal punishment. course As this Rs. 1,000 would merely have come out of Sheikh Esa’s pocket of se I remained obdurate, and was eventually informed that Sheikh Ali had — &gt; ^ gone to the town to collect his men. A little later 4 culprits were produced and duly identified by Mr. Bahnson as having actually participated in the assault on him. I may mention here that, apart from bruises, the latter received a very nasty wound on the head and narrowly escaped having his skull fractured. The four men having been brought and identified Sheikh Esa asked permis sion to return to Muharrag as it was now getting late and left his son, Abdulla, with instructions to have the chastisement of the men carried out in communi cation with me. Before he took his departure it was agreed between us that I would start the inquiry into the Arah-Persian affray case the following morning and that he would send his son or 'Vazier to represent him with instructions to present before me any of his subjects whom I might wish to examine. After his departure the matter of chastisement was proceeded with and every possible obstruction was offered. The Sheikh’s Bazaar Master in Manama who was the proper person to perform the operation, was sent for and directed to bring his canes and executioner. He absolutely refused saying that no canes could he procured and that it was more than he dared, to have any hand in the punishment of Sheikh Ali’s men directly or indirectly. Finally, I was obliged to send to the Commander of His Majesty’s Ship Redbreast for a weapon, and two Arab bystanders or retainers of his own were called upon by Sheik Abdulla to inflict the whipping.5 They were both tried and both endeavoured to make a farce of it, and after one or two futile experiments the services of a blue-jacket were called in as a last resort, and two dozen strokes suitably administered in the presence of the doctor. The flogging was performed in the public street outside the British Agency. 13. I have now completed the narrative of the progress and details of the case and feel that an apology is necessary for the tedious length which the relation of them has achieved. Had Bahrein difficulties ended with the present case I should not have thought it necessary to report in such detail. But in order to deal with the second case which I have to report upon in continuation of my telegram, “Bahrein Affairs No. 2,” dated 12th instant, the Government of India will, I think, find it necessary to take the whole situation now existing at Bahrein into serious review. It is consequently most important that they should be in a position to form conclusions on the detailed facts reported apart from any personal views which Captain Prideaux or I may be found to put forward. 14. As regards the chastisement of Sheikh Ali’s truculent retainers, Captain Prideaux and I had plenty of opportunities during the remaining five days of my stay in Bahrein of gauging its effect. I can only say that both missionaries, merchants and others with whom we came in contact were of opinion that in the eyes of all law abiding members of the Manama community, Arab or otherwise, the punishment exacted had been badly needed and had had a highly salutary effect. 15. As regards the incident generally I have the honour to point out that when the temporary situation at Bahrein came to my knowledge on 29th November I had to regard it from three points of view— (1) That a young European trader of quiet and inoffensive character had been severely assaulted and that in order to reassure European subjects of our own and those of other Powers for the safety of whose subjects in Bahrein we are morally responsible, prompt and vigorous action was evidently necessary. (2) That Herr Wonckhaus’s reference to the German Consulate at Bushirehad brought into prominent issue the nature of our quasi- protectorate in Bahrein in the same way that French action has recently done in another connection, and that the German Government or any other Government similarly interested would gain an opening for assailing our regime, if they could show that we could not or did not give their subjects effective protection. I may add confidentially that I find that my active Bussian colleague thought the Bahrein incidents of sufficient public interest to send a long wire to his Government on the subject. ( 3 ) It was evident from the reports of our local officers that owing to the weakness of Sheikh Esa’s rule a considerable amount of rowdyism was generally prevalent in Manama which it was necessary to repress. 16. I shall say more on the subject of Sheikh Ali’s future when reporting on the second incident. Meanwhile I beg that as soon as possible after perusal of the foregoing the Government of India will be pleased to instruct me by telegraph to the following effect so far as is in accordance with their own view s:— (1) That the compensation money of Bs. 1,000 may be paid over to Mr, Bahnson. ( 2 ) That I may be permitted to warn Sheikh Esa as from Government that Sheikh Ali will not be permitted to return to Bahrein at the expiry of the provisional three weeks’ absence stipulated for by me, should it so happen that Government have not been able within that time to come to a decision with regard to him. The undertaking obtained from Sheikh Esa in this connection forms enclosure No. 14 to this report. 3263 F. D.Enclosure No. 1. No. 225, dated the 1st October 1904). From—J. C. Gaskin, Esq., Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, rji 0 Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to forward, for your information, copy of a letter, dated fu p ootVi Sentember 1904, X have received, from Herr H onckhaus, legarding an outrage committed by Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed and his followers in the German firm’s premises on Thursday last. I would venture to report that immediately on the receipt of information I proceeded to the scene of the outrage and interrogated the members of the German firm’s staff concerned in the matter and found the main facts to be as set forth in the above-quoted communication. I caused Sheikh Ali to appear before me to explain his conduct. He stated that by his orders his servant went out to secure a coolie for his service and when he got hold of one, the German s native clerk assaulted his servant with a stick and inflicted several contusions on the man s body and had draun blood, also he produced a broken cane alleged to have been employed by the clerk. The man was produced and upon examination no traces of assault were visible and the stick was admitted to belong to Sheikh All’s man, but evidently a scuffle had taken place and the clerk had wrenched the stick from Sheikh All’s man and made use of it. The man, however, appears to have been the aggressor by seizing hold of the clerk by the throat and the latter defended himself in the best way he could. Sheikh All’s man apparently took an exaggerated story to his master whereupon the latter sent after the native clerk to appear before him, but being occupied with the firm’s business he informed the Sheikh’s messenger that he would go to him later on. Sheikh Ali evidently took umbrage at the reply and proceeded with a number of followers to the German’s house and meeting the clerk in the hall asked him if he had struck his servant, and on receiving a reply in the affirmative he struck the clerk some blows on the left side of the neck. The Sheikh’s followers at the same time seized another coolie on the premises and started hiding him with sticks and Mr. Bahnson, an Assistant to Herr Wonckhaus, hearing the noise went below and in the attempt to extricate the coolie, received several blows about his person and head, one of which inflicted a cut a little over f J inches long exposing the scalp and causing the loss of a quantity of blood. When questioned Sheikh Ali at first denied having struck the clerk, but when confronted with him he acknowledged having done so. Further, he made no attempt to stop his followers from assaulting the coolie on the premises when asked to do so hy Mr. Bahnson, and when the latter endeavoured to pro tect the coolie, Sheikh Ali tried to stop him from reaching the coolie. Tinder ordinary circumstances the incident would not have been considered so serious. But the conditions prevailing in Bahrein are such as to necessitate the adoption of extreme measures for the suppression of similar occurrences which otherwise may jeopardize the lives of Europeans and their employes should they be repeated. I have been obliged to bring to the notice of the Chief the interference of his men and the attendants of the petty Sheikhs with persons in the service of the British and German firms here on several occasions, and though the Chief has warned the petty Sheikhs accordingly, they do not appear to pay any heed to him. Unless the servants are effectually protected from molestation the firms will find their employes deserting them to the detriment of their business generally. I have considered it my duty to put the case before the Chief strongly and demanded the punishment and expulsion of the. men who were concerned in the outrage also a fine of Rs. 1,090. The Chief said he would enquire into the matter and communicate with me later. I trust that you will approve of my action.7 + The Chief will probably endeavour to avoid doing anything in the matter as be is a little afraid of Sheikh Ali and bis brothers, and it may be necessary for you to bring strong pressure to bear upon the Chief to induce him to punish the offenders. Enclosure No. 2. Dated the 29th September 1904, p rom —H err Robert W onckhaus, Bahrein, To—J. C. Gaskin, Esq., Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein. I am sorry to have to report to you the following matter. This forenoon some of my regularly employed coolies were engaged in measuring shells and in bringing them into my godown; while thus employed one of the coolies was taken hold of by one of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed’s men, as Sheikh Ah bin Ahmed wanted some coolies to work for him (sukhra). The coolie refused and ran into my godown leaving one empty bag of mine in the hands of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed’s men who stuck to it. My native clerk, Abdulla bin Ostat Ahmed, noticing this went to Sheikh Ali bm Ahmed’s man asking him why he did so, and adding, out of politeness to Sheikh Ah bin Ahmed, that if Sheikh Ali was in need of some coolies he might only send to his Saheh, and he would be sure of getting some but that those coolies in question were employed just now in urgent work for me, but other coolies were at his disposal if he cared to make it known to me. The Sheikh s man replied he wanted these very coolies and none else, saying this in a very inso lent w r av. Thereupon my native clerk, Abdulla, requested the man to return the empty bag belonging to me, which he had taken £ ” clbl y fr ° m ® 00 '! e - This man refused again, becoming insolent. Abdulla then took hold of the bag adding at the same time that if Sheikh Ah bm Ahmed was in need of some empty bags too, he might send to me and ask for some. The man of the Sheikh did not listen to reason, and each of the two parties tried to tear the bac from the other. So far this had happened just in front of my house, but during this dispute about the bag, both of them entered my godown. In my eodown the Sheikh’s man got hold of my clerk by the throat whereupon my flerk in his turn got hold of the other man’s throat and struck him once or twToe with the slick belonging to the _ Sheikh’s man. This stick he had managed to take away from the man during the fight. _ Mr Bahnson, a European employee of mine, who was sitting in the office nnstairs' heard the noise and ran down, succeeding, together w.th another man belongin' to Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed, to separate the two people. Mr. Bahnson thereupon returned to the office upstairs. •Five or ten minutes after this Mr. Bahnson was informed by one of my r. iw slipikh Ali bin Ahmed had come into my house himself, where- Mr* Bahnson invited him through the clerk, Abdulla, to come upstairs, “Shttm Sheikh refused. The Sheikh then asked Abdulla who is person- ^ well known to him, whether he had struck him the Sheik’s man; and receiving a reply in the affirmative he struck Abdulla several blows with his Inck Abdulla crossing his arms and offering no resistance whatsoever out of ‘ el w Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed, which according to my personal idea this reSP ev^dXved I tnu^t add here that Sheikh Ali did not come all by himself hntwas accompanied by about twenty of his servants and followers who all of them were armed with sticks. Some of Sheikh All’s people took one of my coolies who was absolutely unconcerned in the matter and gave him a strong hiding in front of Ah bin Ahmed. This all happened in my own house ]ust below the office. when Mr Bahnson heard a noise again he went downstairs and seeing that the Sheikh’s men were hammering away at one of my coolies in my own house ordered them to stop, and when this had no effect covered tne coolie with his own body, naturally assuming that this would effectively stop _ their ; rnnrlnct Mr. Bahnson had run down as he had been sitting in the Sut a hat on and naturally neither carried stick nor any other arms, which iSf shfuld have proved to the people that he had absolutely no ' aggressiveIntention. Instead of stopping the beating of the unfortunate coolie,* '1 the well-meant action of Mr. Bahnson produced quite an unforeseen eff^f t. The lot of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed’s people, about twenty of them, at once started to hammer away with their sticks at Mr. Bahnson, inflicting among, other injuries, a nasty cut on Mr. Bahnson’s head 1\' long and about broad which produced a very strong loss of blood, in fact Mr. Bahnson being covered with his own blood all over the head, face and chest, the shirt being soaked with blood. During this assault on Mr. Bahnson Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed pretended to protect Mr. Bahnson by getting hold of his body and one of his arms, which naturally, instead of proving a protection only hindered Mr. Bahnson in the use of his arms, which he was holding up for protectur** - of his head. Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed did not order his men to stop, and in Mr. Bahnson’s opinion his behaviour proved that his people were acting under his own orders, and that he, Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed, never really meant to protect Mr. Bahnson. Mr. Wonckhaus who had been out of the house visiting a customer received news that fighting was going on in his house and hurrying back to the house found that the people had just left off striking Mr. Bahnson. On his arrival most of the assailants dispersed. Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed himself with five or six of his followers remaining in the house. Mr. Wonckhaus having no idea what really had happened but seeing Mr. Bahnson bleeding profusely asked Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed to come upstairs and explain matters, telling him that I would send to the British Assistant Political Agent, Mr. Gaskin, and that it would be well for him, Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed, to have the matter settled through Mr. Gaskin privately. To this Sheikh Ali first agreed, but when being upstairs for two or three minutes, he decided otherwise and said he would go to his own house, and if anything of him was being wanted, Mr. Gaskin might send for him, this in a very insolent tone. Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed then left with his followers and Mr. Wonckhaus cleaned Mr. Bahnson’s wound and face of the blood and bandaged the wound. Ten minutes after this Mr. Gaskin arrived in my house and the rest of course is known to you. I have had repeatedly to complain to Mr. Gaskin against the highhanded ness of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed’s and other Sheikh’s servants and followers, and the customs of the Sheikh’s men pressing my coolie they happen to meet for work, which the Sheikh wants to be done is a highly deplorable habit, which I venture to think ought to be stopped by the responsible authorities once for all. I do not think it necessary to point out to you the seriousness of the offence committed by Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed and his followers, and I only venture to inform you of Mr. Bahnson’s idea of compensation and satisfaction. The least which Mr. Bahnson expects is :— Firstly —The public punishment of the more conspicuous assailants who are known to Mr. Bahnson and my clerk, Abdulla, who was present. These men will be recognised when the culprits will be brought before Mr. Bahnsom In order to be sure that the punishment is really meted out to the culprits, Mr. Bahnson suggests that he should be present at the occasion. Secondly —Mr. Bahnson expects a money compensation of Rs. 1,000 (one thousand rupees) for the injury received; and Thirdly —I should think it fit if intimation were to be given to all the petty Sheikhs of the island, that they have to abstain from pressing coolies who are employed by me for their work. I hope that you will be able to bring the matter to a satisfactory con clusion. Enclosure No. 3 . Translation of a letter from Sheikh Isa bin Ali al Khalifah, Chief of Bahrein, to Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated the 20th Rajah 1322 (1st October 1904). addressed to me by Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed al Khalifah on the subject of the V Noccurrence which took place between him and Bahnson, the German, and to state that I am not anxious that such occurrences should happen, but after it occurred I made investigation to ascertain the truth. It appeared that the fault was on the part of the German. He has also done further oppression, and I have received many complaints against him which I have not taken into consideration. When Ali bin Ahmed submitted his petition and produced proofs that he was not guilty, and that the guilt was on the part of the German, I deemed it iecessary to represent the case to you because, if such proceedings are repeated by him and others, disturbances will take place. The decision rests with you. Enclosure No. 4. From— Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed al Khalifah, Bahrein, To—S heikh Isa bin Ali al Khalifah, Chief of Bahrein. I beg to bring to your notice that a jolly boat containing some cargo for me arrived here to-day, and I told my servants to land it. They hired coolies on the wharf. One of the coolies entered the building in which the German resides and one of our men followed him to call him, whereupon the servants of the German turned him out and assaulted him. This news reached me but I did not believe that he will consent that our men should be beaten. I despatched some servants to enquire into the case. Ere their arrival on the spot the German’s servants came out and began to beat them; I could not keep quiet at that time, and I went to reconcile the parties with a view that no disturbance may occur and that I may not be blamed by the Sheikhs for having acted impolitely. When I reached the gate of the building, I saw a large number of people consisting of the German’s servants, coolies and the people who work on the wharf. Meanwhile the junior German whose name is Bahnson saw me, came down, and caught me by waist and did not allow me to reconcile the parties. Indeed, if I did not fear the Sheikhs I would not have allowed him to dis honour me thus. When I and him were pushing each other, his head was scratched by the wall and there are many witnesses to this fact. If you wish I will produce the witnesses. I thought it necessary to represent the case to you and you will not be pleased that such disregard should be shown to me by a man who is well known to be an oppressor and wicked. Enclosure No. 5. Telegram, dated the 7th October 1904. From— Captain A. P. Trevor, First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— Captain F. B. Prideaux, care of the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, Karachi. Gaskin reports fracas between one Sheikh Ali and one of Wonckhaus’ clerks, named Bahnson. You might, after consulting Gaskin, enquire into the matter, and if no settlement can be effected locally, submit a report giving your views and recommendations at an early date, and saying if you concur with Gaskin as to punishment, etc. NOTE. This message could not be sent yesterday owing to press of work. To-day Mr. Mungavin wired, suggesting I should write demi-officially to Captain Prideaux to catch him at Maskat.10 I have written practically in the same terms as the message rather amplified to Captain Prideaux, and have asked him in addition whether he considers that if the case cannot be settled by him and the Chief it should wait till Resident’s visit. A. P. TREVOR. The 8th October 1904. Enclosure No. 6 . No. 3-12, dated the 11th October 1904. From— Captain A. P. Trevor, First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To —Sheikh Isa bin Ali al Khalifah, Chief of Bahrein. I have received your letter dated 20th Rajab 1322 (1st October 1904), regarding the unfortunate incident which has happened between your nephew, Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed and Herr Bahnson, the German. I have also received the version of the incident from the opposite party, and it seems to me that it is very important, in the interests of ali concerned, that you should use your best endeavours to settle the matter at an early date in consultation with the Political Officer. Enclosure No. 7. No. 252, dated the 31st October 1904. From— Captain F. B. Prideaux, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to refer to my predecessor’s letter No. 225, dated the 1st October 1904, with which Mr. Gaskin forwarded a copy of a letter received from Mr. Wonckhaus on the subject of a fracas that had occurred in the latter’s courtyard, and in which he reported the demands he had made to the Chief of Bahrein for satisfaction, and asked for your approval concerning them. 2. On looking into the case myself, I cannot help thinking that the terms imposed by Mr. Gaskin are unreasonably severe, and this opinion 1 find is held both by Messrs. Milborrow and Zwemer, the other Europeans on the Island, and also by all the leading natives of the place. Before, therefore, mooting the subject at all to the Chief, I have endeav oured to persuade Mr. Wonckhaus to lessen his demands, but unfortunately without success. 3. Copies of the letter I addressed to Mr. Wonckhaus and of the reply I received are enclosed. Mr. Monckhaus’ letter has not effected any change in my opinion. The tc Sukhra ” custom being such as it is, I do not think Sheikh Ali s clerk was bound to accept the cooly’s word that he was in the employment of Mr. Wonckhaus until it was corroborated by Abdulla. I can find no evidence that Sheikh Ali instigated the assault on Mr. Bahnson, and if it be conceded that the Sheikh’s followers did not strike that gentleman accidentally, their action can still be suitably dealt with by imprisonment. Mr. Bahnson is^ anxious to see the men “ sticked ” but in a country so much affected by British influence, as Bahrein, I think the punishment of flogging should be countenanced as rarely as possible by ourselves. Lastly, there is no doubt, I believe, that in this case Sheikh Isa’s ies are s longly with Sheikh Ali, and that if the payment of a fine is insisted upon, ! nil be paid solely by the Chief himself. As the latter’s impecunious s a e is we known, I am inclined to deprecate imposing upon him this form ol punishment whenever any alternative can be devised to meet the case. 4. I shall at the first opportunity inform Sheikh Isa that the whole ques ion ias een referred to you for consideration, and I venture to express e opinion at if you consider the terms I have suggested too light, they can be most suitably ma de heavier by the enhancement of the periods of Bionfrorathe Islands ” 1103611 ^ tUe SheikU ’ s or by the latter’s expul-Enclosure No 8 . No. 248, dated the 28th October ] 904. From— Captain F. B. Puideaux, Assistant Political Agent Bahrein, To— Heru Robert Wonckhaus, Bahrein. I hnve been considering the case reported by you to my predecessor in regard to which you claim compensation from Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed al Khalifah tor the assault committed by his servants on your Assistant, Mr. Bahnson. heard both sides and made further independent enquiries, I think that the following are the points of importance to be noted, there having been errors of judgment and improper actions on both sides, those on the Sheikh’s undoubtedly preponderating. The first mistake of course was committed when Sheikh Ali’s man refused to give up your firm’s bag to your man, Abdullah. The latter, however, then erred still more seriously when he endeavoured to recover the bag by force, used language which was calculated to accentuate the quarrel, and ended by striking the Sheikh’s servant with the latter’s own stick. At this point it will be noticed that Mr. Bahnson was assisted by another servant of the Sheikh’s to terminate the fight, and if matters had locally been carried no further, I think your servant would have been adjudicated to be the greater offender. I have been told that he has an overbearing manner which in a case like the one under consideration was not advantageous to your interests. Sheikh All, however, immediately lost all his advantage by sending peremptorily round for Abdullah, then entering your premises without consenting to see Mr. Bahnson, striking Abdullah and permitting his followers to thrash one of your coolies who had no concern with the case, but who was presumably believed to be the orio-inal starter of it. ° At this stage Mr. Bahnson committed an error of judgment by going down into the melee instead of sending round word either to Sheikh Isa’s chief representative on the Island or to Mr. Gaskin, the British Political Officer. ^ 0 t&gt; believe that Sheikh Ali himself had any intention of causing Mr. Bahnson to be beaten, and it is difficult to say whether the servants struck him accidentally or through exasperation at his intervention. At any rate it does not appear that the cooly was very much hurt, and the injury done to Mr. Bahnson s sense of dignity was probably greater than that committed on his per- SOI o ^ ra ? as seeri [ ls b^ve subsided of itself before your arrival on the scene, and the fact that Sheikh Ali accompanied’you upstairs indicates, I think, that he was anxious to settle the affair amicably. I presume that he left you before Mr. Gaskin s arrival on gettingsome idea of the terms which you contemplated demanding of him and because he thought them unreasonable. . The system of Suhhrct is, as you know, one of long standing—a right enjoyed by all the members of the Buling Pamily of Bahrein and other Arab States, over the peasant class, and is not to be abolished without the exercise of a good deal of diplomacy or without time. Sheikh Ali’s servant has been punished for not realizing that the cooly who started the trouble was your employee by the beating he received from Abdulla. Abdulla has atoned for his mistakes |by submitting quietly to the chastise ment given him by Sheikh Ali. If Mr. Bahnson had followed the proper course he would not have been assaulted, and therefore I do not think I can support his claim for personal pecuniary compensation, but it is of course a very grave offence for an Asiatic to assault a European without just provocation, and I shall insist on the coolies whom he can identify on oath as having struck him being punished by the Sheikh of Bahrein. I think that a month’s imprisonment would be the most suitable form of punishment. a : m S r ?? a 1 rds S^ikh Ali I believe that a formal apology tendered to yourself and Mr. Bahnson for his unlawful intrusion upon, and actions on your premises made either before Sheikh Isa and myself at Moharrag or before myself and the Wazier at your house would meet the requirements of the case. It is of course well understood in the Islands that no employes of Europeans can be legally impressed by other persons, and therefore it is not necessary to issue any new orders on the lines of your third suggestion.12 These are the views I have formed on the case, and if you acquiesce in them, I think, I shnll be able to bring the affair to a speedy conclusion. If vou are not satisfied it will be necessary to await definite orders from my superior officer, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who will retuin to Bushire from the interior of Persia on or about the 20th November next. Enclosure No. 9. Dated Bahrein, the SOth October 190t. From— Herr Robert Wonckhaus, T 0 —Captain F. B. Prideavx, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein. Your letter, dated 28th instant, was duly received by me. I cannot agree to what you say that “ there have been errors of judgment and improper actions on both sides At least as far as Mr. Bahnson is concerned, I venture to have a different opinion and concerning the action of my man Abdullah I do not think that blame is to be attached to his behaviour. You yourself admit that the first mistake of course was committed by the man of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed refusing to give up the firm’s bag to my man Abdullah. I believe that this was not the first mistake committed by the Sheikh’s man; the first mistake was undoubtedly that he pressed a coolie employed by me and that he stuck (sic) to him though he was told in a very polite way by my servant Abdullah that if Sheikh Ali wanted some coolies he might only send over and ask me for some as a favour. According to your idea Abdullah “erred still more seriously when he endeavoured to recover the bag by force, used language which was calculated to accentuate the quarrel and ended by striking the Sheikh’s servant with the latter’s own stick.” This I believe is not quite correct; I should think that if a man takes away property of mine and be it only an empty bag he is a thief and I do not see the reason why a man should not try to recover his lawful property from a thief by taking it away from him even by force if necessary. It is not at all certain that Abdullah was the first man to use language “ which was calculated to accentuate the quarrelon the contrary, he asserts that it was the Sheikh’s man who used offensive language and who was even the first one to attack. Abdullah had only touched the bag so far and not the man at all. That in the fight which ensued Abdullah proved the stronger, managed to take the Sheikh’s man’s stick away from him and struck the man with it, Abdullah quite admits, but I do not think it fair to blame a man when being attacked first, for his getting the best of the fight. At this point Mr. Bahnson was assisted by another servant of the Sheikh to terminate the fight, and if matters had ended here, the whole affair would not have been of much importance, and I venture to think that even at this time the balance would not at all be in favour of the Sheikh’s man. If you have been told by somebody that my man Abdullah has an overbear ing manner that somebody does not seem to be a competent judge of it. This servant of mine is with me for six years and I daresay I can claim more know ledge of his character and manners than any outsider, and I can honestly confess that I have never noticed an overbearing manner of his in his dealings with people. The fact of Abdullah’s submitting to the unjustified hiding (sic) he received from Sheikh Ali without striking in his turn does not seem to me to bear out your presumption of his having an overbearing manner. I must say that I and with me probably most people have noticed that more or less all the servants of the different Sheikhs of this place do possess an overbearing manner. This fact is borne out by the stories and threats against Europeans generally which have been started by some of Ali bin Ahmed’s people in these days after the affair. So much for this less important part of the affair. What happened after this seems to me to be such a serious misbehaviour of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmedand his people that I am sorry to say I cannot at all share your views which you formed on the case. Since I have given you all the details of the matter in my first letter to you and since from your answer it appears that you have quite satisfied yourself as to the literal correctness of my narrative, I do not think it necessary to mention these happenings over again; I only wish to rectify some errors of yours. Firstly, you say you “ do not believe that Sheikh Ali himself had any intention of causing Mr. Bahnson to be beaten.” As for this it will not be possible to ascertain what really Sheikh Ali’s intentions were, but Mr. Bahnson who ought to be able to judge best by the Sheikh’s behaviour at that time and I myself are absolutely unshaken in our belief (which by the by is shared by a good many people) that Sheikh Ali was the instigator of the assault on Mr. Bahnson. If you think “ it is difficult to say whether the servants struck him acci dentally or through exasperation at his intervention ” I think you might take it for granted that there could be no question of accident as Mr. Bahnson has not been hidden (sic) once or twice or even three times accidentally, hut Mr. Bahnson affirms emphatically that he has been systematically beaten. The question of it having occurred accidentally is quite out of possibility. What their motives were I myself have no doubts. I do not believe either that it was caused by “ exasperation at his intervention.” The large wound which Mr. Bahnson sustained in this assault luckily did not prove to be of serious consequences, but I can assure you that all the same Mr. Bahnson lost pounds and pounds of blood; in fact, before I bandaged his wound, Mr. Bahnson on account of loss of blood when lying in the easy chair nearly fainted, but still I agree with you that his “ sense of dignity was even more seriously hurt.” If it appears to you that the coolie was not very much hurt, I and everybody with me, who saw the man, will be of different opinion. The man was sick afterwards and was laid up for more than a week being unable to work and even now he is unable to do heavy work he had to do before the assault. The fra§as had just subsided when I arrived on the scene and it is quite true that Sheikh Ali accompanied me upstairs, but if you conclude from that that he left me again “ on getting some idea of the terms which you contemplated demanding of him ” and that he thought them unreasonable, you are mistaken, since neither I nor anybody else spoke a single word to him about terms or compensation or anything of that sort. I invited him to sit down which he did for about a minute or two whilst I bandaged Mr. Bahnson’s wound. I only addressed him with a few words asking him to tell me how the matter had come about. It was only when Mr. Gaskin had arrived in my house that the question of compensation or terms was raised by Mr. Gaskin by addressing Mr. Bahnson, and it was only then that the proposed terms were fixed. I may add here that when the Sheikh was spoken to by Mr. Gaskin his behaviour was of such a kind as to show clearly that he did not regret the affair at all and Mr. Gaskin himself remarked “ he is not at all apologetic ”. 'While Sheikh Ali was sitting down I sent a second man to Mr. Gaskin to inform him the first messenger having been sent by Abdullah before Mr. Bahnson went downstairs but was overtaken by the second one. When the Sheikh heard me mention Mr. Gaskin’s name he got angry and left in spite of my invitations to wait until Mr. Gaskin had arrived; on the contrary, he said if anything was wanted of him they would know where to find him. Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed’s behaviour after having come upstairs with me was not at all apologetic. In fact, he did show an overbearing manner at that time. I now come to what you call “an error of judgment committed by Mr. Bahnson by going down into the Melee ”. When Mr. Bahnson heard the row downstairs it was his duty to go down and to see what was going on in my house; when coming downstairs he saw that an innocent coolie employed by me was being brutally beaten by several of Sheikh Ali’s men, it was again his duty to interfere and tell them to stop this; or do you expect Mr. Bahnson or meM to quietly look on when an employee of mine, who is absolutely innocent, is' being brutally maltreated in my own house by a set of people who entered my house without my consent ? I think some blame might have attached to Mr. Bahnson if he had tried only to touch any of these people or if he had only used strong language, but nothing of this was done by Mr. Bahnson. He simply asked them to stop immediately and stretched his arms over the unfortunate coolie naturally presuming that this would effectively stop the proceeding. 1 fail to see where the error of judgment on Mr. Balms on’s part comes in. It appears to me that f you seem to think very lightly about Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed and his followers and his servants entering my house without my consent and behaving as if he had a right to let my employees be beaten by himself and his servants. If Sheikh Ali thought, after the first affair between his man and Abdullah had happened, that he had reason to complain, he ought to have followed another course which was open to him either by informing me of it by settling the matter amicably or by directing himself to the Chief of Bahrein. Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed’s highhandedness in the first instance and alone is the real cause of the unfortunate affair, and I venture to say that if he is not made to pay dearly for it some way or the other this time, in future his respect for all Europeans generally will be nil and this might lead to further occurrences of a similar kind if not worse. I thank you very much for what you say regarding the Sukhra system- It does not contain any point which has not been known to me since long. Of course, it is “ well understood in the islands that no employee of Europeans can legally be impressed by other persons,” but if it is so well under stood why do these things always and ever happen again ? I myself have had to complain of it several times to your predecessor Mr. Gaskin, and more than a dozen times it has happened, and I have not troubled anybody with it because I got tired to complain always of such more trifling matters which nevertheless are very annoying and can lead to serious conse quences as shown by this affair. I venture to say it is not good enough that everybody in the islands only understands that European employees are free of Sukhra, but the people, especially the servants of all the Sheikhs of the islands, must be made to obey, and if they do not, they ought to be punished somehow. The opinion which you have formed on the case and the terms you propose are so widely different from what I think to be right, that I fear that an under standing about this matter between you and myself will be very difficult. I therefore propose to send in by this mail to the German Consul in Bushire the correspondence regarding the affair, and I shall put the whole matter into his hands for settlement. Enclosure No. 10 . Dated the 5th November 1904. From—H err Robert Wonckhaus, To Captain F. B. Prideaux, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein. With reference to my letter dated 30th October, I regret that I have to report to you another case regarding the “ Sukhra ” which happened to-day. My coolies were employed in bringing wood from the boat into my godown w ien a man of Sheikh Hamad bin Isa got hold of one of them, struck him for^e 16 C0 °^ ie re ^ use( ^ come along with him, stating that he was working The coolie succeeded to get the man of the Sheikh to come into my godown w lerc my man Abdunabi told the Sheikh’s man that the coolie was employed an °ut for another one. But even now the -u man . . wan t to leave the coolie alone and it was necessary that Mr. Bahnson himself told the Sheikh’s man accordingly. Of course, the matter is important enough to complain about it, but I only an ® s y^ u that it is not at all understood, that my coolies cannot be accordin^ 1 G s man a that the Sheikh’s people in any case do not act^ I do not doubt that some of the Sheikhs have the good will not to take my coolies, but I know that the servants and followers of the Sheikhs do not mind it at all. It is, of course, of no consequence, but I only want to state that the Sheikh’s man showed an overbearing manner by speaking loudly and big and even mentioned to my clerk Abdunabi that he would complain to the Sheikh about him and about me. In fact, he acted as if he thought to be in his right by taking the coolie although the same was employed by me. This shows again how little the Sheikh’s people grasp the situation. No. 259, dated the 7th November 1904. Prom— Captain P. B. Frideaux, Assistant Political A gent, Bahrein, To— Sheikh Isa bin Ali al Khalifah, Bahrein. I received a letter from Mr. Eobert Wonckhaus, the German, complaining that on the 5th instant one of Sheikh Hamad bin Isa’s servants was forcibly trying to take away one of the German’s coolies while the man was bringing wood from a boat to the German’s godown,— that on the coolie refusing to follow the Sheikh’s man the latter struck him and followed him up to the German’s godown where the German’s man Abdunabi told Sheikh Hamad’s servant that the coolie was in the service of the German, but he would not hear of it and did not leave the coolie alone until he was told to do so by Mr. Bahnson. To prevent similar regrettable incidents in future I request that orders may be re-issued to all the Sheikhs and Amirs to the effect that no coolies in the employ of Europeans can be forcibly taken away by any one. The system of “ Sukhra ” is regarded, as you may well understand, by the British Government as objectionable in the same manner as is slavery. Every instance which brings to notice the oppression entailed by this system must, therefore, ultimately afPect the interests of the persons who profit by its existence, and this fact I think might well he instilled into their minds. Dated the 10th November 1904. Prom— Sheikh Isa bin Ali al Khalifah, Bahrein, To— Captain F. B. Pmdeatix, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein. I received your letter. You state that Mr. R. Wonckhaus wrote to you on the 5th instant that my son’s servant was trying to take away forcibly one of the German’s coolies and that on the coolies refusing to obey the servant struck him. % I have now to inform you that orders were long ago issued to the Sheikhs and Amirs forbidding them to impress coolies in the service of the German as well as of others of similar standing. The Germans as well as others of similar position have no authority what ever over the poor coolies that work along the seashore and when they are taken for work by the Sheikh’s servants they are paid their hire. I do not, however, desire that they should be taken forcibly. I understand that Mr. Bahnson invents these stories for your information. I do not like all these things as much as you would not like them. I hope you will not take these complaints as true. No. 260, dated the lOtk November 1904. Prom— Captain P. B. Prideaux, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, To— Herr Robert Wonckhaus, Bahrein. With reference to your letter dated the 5th instant, I have the honour to inform you that the Chief of Bahrein, in reply to a letter I wrote to him on the16 subject of tbe recent action of Sheikh Hamad’s servant, has stated that he doef not recognize the custom of &lt;f Snkhra,” and that he cannot believe that any one of his relatives or officials would ever contemplate impressing your coolies. I am hopeful that my letter will have the effect of saving you from further annoyance on this point. Enclosure No. 11. Translation of a letter from the German Consul at Bushire, dated the 19th October 1904, to Sheikh Isa bin Alt al Khalifah, Chief of Bahrein. I have been lately informed that the servants and coolies of Sheikh Ahmed bin Ali, your nephew, struck Mr. JBahnson, a German, in the service of Herr R. Wonckhaus at Bahrein on the head inflicting a severe cut, but that up to now you have not punished the culprits. I therefore request you to enquire into the affair with a view to compensating Mr. Bahnson at an early date and punishing the offenders with a flogging before the public. Translation of Sheikh Isa’s reply, dated the 7th November 1904, to the German Consul at Bushire. I received your letter, dated 19th October 1904, and learnt that you have been informed of the dispute between my nephew, Ali bin Ahmed, and Mr. Bahnson, the German. I have now to inform you that this matter is before the British Government and I cannot say anything on the subject. Enclosure No. 12. Extract from a letter No. 270, dated 17th November 1904, from Captain F. B, Prideaux, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, to Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.F., Officiating PoliUcal Resident in the Persian Gulf. **«**•« To console himself for the slight which he considers put upon himself, Sheikh Ali has formed around his person a body-guard of big men, mostly negroes who are a terror to all quietly disposed residents in the Bazaar and whom I believe no man in the Chief’s entourage dares touch. Nearly all the men who are implicated in the Bahnson affair have now also taken part in this more recent case. It may be that Sheikh Isa is unwilling to see the family dignity injured through the punishment even of a nephew who is disloyal to himself, but I firmly believe now that my predecessor Mr. Gaskin’s view also is correct that the Chief dare not attempt to exercise authority over Sheikh Ali. The fact that Sheikh Ali is disloyal at any rate in thought to his uncle is proved by his saying to me when he called at the Agency to welcome my arrival that if he had the share in the Government, which his father had held, he would be happy to use his influence towards the proper reformation of the Customs administration. 12 . I now have to make the following recommendations. In the absence of a British gunboat it is certain that no punitive measures will be submitted to by Sheikh Ali and his gang either in the Wonekbaus case or the present one. I hope that as quickly as possible a gunboat may be sent here, and, if possible, allowed to remain here during the month of Bamzan, as I am not too confident that even the Hindu community will be safe much longer. 13. I think that on the arrival of the man-of-war Sheikh Ali should be summoned on board with all his male servants. Mr. Bahnson might be invited on board and asked to identify the men who were concerned in the assault on himself. All such who may be known to have taken part also in the later affair should be soundly flogged on board, then sent to Moharrag for one year’s imprisonment and then expelled from tlie islands, in the event of security for . behaviour not being forthcoming. I think such action on our part as this is justified by the Chief’s weakness and actively wrongful attitude.14. Sheikh Ali should be banished from Bahrein and preferably made to reside at Aden for at least 10 years. His brothers can administer his properties and remit him the proeeeds. The old “Government House” should, however, be made over at a valuation to the Chief for the use of his son Sheikh Hamad. 15. Finally, Sheikh Isa, I think, should be told emphatically that no disputes between Shiahs and Sunnis are henceforth to be referred to the Shera Court, any more than disputes between Hindus and Muhammadans are. The Shiahs who are mostly Persians, in the absence of the Shah’s Consular representatives, naturally look to us for protection, and as the British Government are interested in the welfare of all classes in Bahrein, they cannot view with equanimity the injustice even of making Bahreini Shiahs (who are all Persians by origin) submit to the jurisdiction of a religious court other than their own. All such cases should be adjudicated upon by the Chief himself or by an impartial Mejlis. Enclosure No. 13. Translated purport of a telegram from the Mushir-ud-Dowleh, Teheran, to the Persian Traders in Bahrein. I received your telegram regarding the assault on you by the Bahrein Arabs. Keep yourselves calm, for I have had a long talk with the British Minister on the subject, and I am sure he will take early steps to get the affair settled and get the culprits punished. Enclosure No. 14. (Translation.) Undertaking given to Resident by Sheikh of Bahrein, dated 28th Ramzan 1322. I, Sheikh Isa bin Ali al Khalifah, urge that my personal self respect and that of my family will be broken if Sheikh Ali is compelled to leave Manama immediately before the Eamzan Eed, which will be only 3 days hence. But I hereby give the most solemn undertaking possible that within 7 days after the departure of Major Cox from Bahrein, Sheikh Ali and his followers shall also leave Bahrein for change of air and shall remain away from Bahrein until such time as Major Cox shall receive a reply from Government, and if no such reply or instructions shall arrive up to 3 weeks (a month in all) Sheikh Ali shall be at liberty to return to Bahrein. And if the Besident will accept this arrangement, I promise and undertake to place special guards on the Bazaar, day and night, to such an extent as will satisfy Captain Prideaux, the Political Agent, so that there may be no possibility of a recurrence of rowdiness for the future.No. 421, dated Bushire, the 17th (received 26th) December 1904. From— Major P, Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf, r lo The Secretary to the G-overnment of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to submit the further report advised in my telegram “ Bahrein Affairs No. 2 ,” dated 12th Dec mber, and referring to the reported attack by a mob of Arabs and Negroes upon certain subjects of His Majesty 4||e Shah, residing in Bahrein for purposes of trade. 2. Before commenting upon the correspondence forming the enclosures to this communication, I venture to record a few facts, or observations, which may perhaps be necessary to elucidate the general situation at Bahrein. The population of the Islands is composed of two distinct but equally important elements, namely :— (a) Sunni Mahommedans—Arabs with a sprinkling of Negroes, keeping up a constant and more or less migratory connection with the Arabs of the mainland. Among these is the family of the Ruling Chief which is of the Uttoobee tribe. (b) Shia Mahommedans, namely, “ Bahreinis that is, the old Bahrein stock, of somewhat uncertain origin. Out of the total island popu lation, which, if I remember right, is estimated at a )out 70,0Q0 souls, the proportion of the two denominations is about equal, the Bahreinis being a little in the majority. In the population of Manama are included between 50 and 100 Persian subjects engaged in unpretentious trade and mostlv owning small shops in the Bazaar. They are, I need hardly mention, of the Shia persuasion. It will be realised that they form an infinitesimal part of the Manama com munity and like our own Indian traders, were it not for the measure of Pax Britannica which the presence of a British representative assures to them, they could hardly trade or reside in complete security in such surroundings even at ordinary times. 3. Chiefist among these Persians is one Haji Abd ul Nabi, who conducts the cargo-landing business on belialf of the person whn ; Mm'mA’’ the monopoly for that wore from the Sheikh, namely, the Vazier Abdurrahman. Tor some months past the said Vazier has been away on the Mecca Pilgrimage, and during his absence Abdul Nabi has conducted the work with full powers from his principal. He is also employed to some extent by Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co., and is at the same time the authorised contractor for the provisioning of British men-of-war when stationed at Bahrein. Abdul Nabi may be neither more nor less scrupulous than others of his stamp, but the British India Company’s Agent informed me that from their point of view he is a satisfactory man, and that during Jiis conduct of the cargo-landing business, they had experienced much less of the petty thieving from packages of merchandise in transit, which had formerly been very prevalent. Three months ago it appears that this Abdul Nabi had personally traced and run to earth a gang of Arab house and boat thieves and had brought about the discovery of a quantity of stolen goods at their lodging. Eight Arabs were in consequence imprisoned, of whom five were subsequently released and three still remain in confinement. In consequence of this occurrence Haji Abdul Nabi went for some days afterwards in fear of his life, and though that apprehension had gradually past off, he was well aware at the time that the present incidents arose that he was not a persona gra+a among the less law-abiding members of the Arab population of Manama, in which category it seems that Sheikh Ali and his retainers had come to occupy a predominant position. 4. Having got thus far I may well leave Captain Prideaux’s original report to furnish the details of the fracas which occurred on I4th November last. In this communication he states clearly the details of what occurred as ascertained immediately afterwards from the best sources of information avail able ; and his account receives circumstantial corroboration from the testimony2 of Dr. Thoms of the American Mission, who attended to the injured. I thipJt- it may be accepted at all events as placing the incident in the light ln w ^ oh u 1 - was presented the following morning to every “ man in the street not actually concerned in it, and except in one or two minor matters of detail, I have little doubt that it represents the correct version of what took place. 5. It was obviously useless to expect any of the injured members of the small Persian community to testify openly to the names of persons whom they had recognized in the mob, for fear of subsequent consequences to themselves, but Captain Prideaux, making inquiries from them and others confidentially, ascer tained the names and ideniity of some 25 persons who had been recognizes among the mob. Among these were several retainers of Sheikh All, some whom had been concerned in the assault upon the German trader a short time before. There can he no doubt that theorjgia^fj&amp;e. disturbance was a pure accident and in no way connected with religion ; when once started the attack was extended to the unpopular Abdul Nabi and his family and employes, and eventually the religious cry was taken up, and every ‘ Mogul who was unfortunate enough to appear on the scene was immediately set upon and beaten. 6 . After the occurrence those Persians who had shops in the Bazar closed them, and fearing from the Sheikh’s attitude that he did not intend to listen to Captain Prideaux but would try and get their case hurried before the local Sunni Shariat, they sent over a telegram to liis Majesty the Shah asking tor support. The Mushir-ud-Dowleh replied that the British authorities had undertaken to see justice done. Meanwhile, Captain Trevor, my Pir^t Assistant, vas able to secure the despatch of His Majesty’s Ship “ Hedhreast ’ to Manama pending my arrival there. 7. On reaching Bahrein on 30th November, I found that the Persian shops were still closed and that the only development since the Political Agent s letter No. 272 of 19th November (hnclosure No. 2) was the departure of Skeilvh Ah and his entourage,—including many of the rowdies “ wanted,’ for a hunting excursion on the mainland behind Bahrein. As I mentioned in my report on the assault upon the German subject, Sheikh Esa’s attitude led me to anticipate some difficulty in settling the second case, and I feared that if both were handled together, the first case might be burked in conjunction with it. I therefore decided to abstain from intervention in the matter of the Sunni-Shia affray until I had done what 1 could in the German case. The latter occupied me till the evening of the 4th December. December 4th .—On that afternoon when I told Skeikh Esa that I was now ready to take up the inquiry in the second case and make the investigation which he had invited me to do, he produced from his pocket a testimony paper (Istishhad) executed by one of the two chief Sunni Mullahs in which a number of persons purported to have testified that they had seen Persians beating Arabs. In handing me this document the Chief said that this was the testimony and complaint of his Arab subjects and he begged that I would see justice done. I replied that the “ Jstishhad ” was of little use to me by itself and that I should want to see all the persons mentioned in it and examine them. He acquiesced, and it having been decided that I should start the inquiry at 8 aai. next morning, he promised to keep his younger son Abdulla in Manama with instruc tions to send to me any of his subjects whom I might wish to examine, and to depute his elder son or his acting Vazier to represent him at the proceedings. 8 . December 5th .—The Persian witnesses who had been directed to present themselves were ready $4 the appointed time 8 a.m., but I was kept waiting 2 J hours for the Sheikh’s representative. Eventually Sheikh Earned, the soil, and the acting Vazier Shereideh put in an appearance, and the former intimated that Shereideh had been deputed to attend on the Chief’s behalf. Por Shereideh see correspondence ending with this Office No. 48 of 4th March 1901. He went on to say, however, that it would not be practicable for Arab witnesses to present themselves for examination by me, for in the first place they would not appear in the presence of the Shias and in the second they weredismayed by the punishment awarded to Sheikh Ali’s servants the day before. I endeavoured to explain to Sheikh Hamed the sanctity of a British Court and the unreasonableness of this attitude, pointing 1 out that his father had parti- •cularly asked me to make this personal inquiry and now that I was beginning to do so he refused to send me the men whom I might want to see. I failed, however, to make any impression upon his ignorant obstinacy and finally told him that I could not afford to waste more time and must at any rate get on with examination of the Persians to-day and would like to inter view his father on the morrow as provisionally arranged, both in order to pro nounce the warning to Sheikh Ali in his presence regarding his departure from Bahrein and then to show him (Sheikh Esa) the results of to-day’s inqui ries into the Arab-Persian case. Hamed then returned to Muharrag and the Vazier Shereideh remained while I recorded the statements of the Persian sufferers. I gave him every opportunity to put questions and cross-examine and his behaviour gave me no cause to complain. Copies of statements accompany (Enclosure No. 6 ) and I request perusal of them, but in view of what follows it seems unnecessary to discuss the details of them at this point, and I will therefore dismiss them with the observation that in most cases the wounds and injuries of the witnesses and the medical evidence afforded corroboration of the general truth of their story and proof of the severity of the attack made upon them. 9. The examination of these witnesses took me till late in the evening. December 6th .—Next morning Captain Prideaux and I visited Sheikh Isa. He being an old man and feeling discomfort from the cold wind and sea on the journey over from Maharrag, we had offered to visit him instead of asking him to come over again. iiis two sons and Sheikh Ali were present, and after the exchange of greetings with the Sheikh, I proceeded to explain my views to Sheikh Ali as to the necessity of his leaving Bahrein forthwith with his unruly followers. He replied that he had no other course open to him than to accept such arrangements as Sheikh Esa and I might come to with regard to him. Thereupon the Chief proceeded to speak stoutly in defence of his nephew, but how far his attitude was genuine and how far assumed in order to save his face before his nephew lam unable to say. The drift of his arguments was that his nephew had been sufficiently punished by the fine of 111,000 and the flogging of his servants and that he had done nothing to deserve the disgrace of expulsion and was entirely under his uncle’s orders. [As to the fine, I fear it must have been paid by Sheikh Esa himself.] After some concessions on either side he was at last induced to accept the draft, written on the spot, of the undertaking which forms enclosure 14 of my previous report (No. 420, dated 17th December 1904) and 'which provided that Sheikh Ali should remain for the Eed and then absent himself and his entourage for three weeks pending receipt of the orders of the Government of India. 10. This matter having been disposed of, we went on to discuss the Arab- Persian affray case. I referred to Sheikh Hamed’s intimation of the day before to the effect that Arabs would not be sent to me for examination, and endeavoured to explain to Sheikh Esa, as I had to his son, the unreasonableness of his attitude. I went on to say that 1 had now heard all the Persian statements, which -were fully borne out by their wounds, (one of the sufferers being an old man of 80 who was nearly battered to death) and that, as he would not let me examine the Arabs, I must form my opinion on the evidence available to me, and all that now remained for me to do was to explain my ideas as to the steps which should be taken to punish the offenders and compensate the sufferers, and discuss them with the Sheikh with a view to their being carried out. I then indicated to Sheikh Esa what my views were (see en closure No._9). At the same time I explained that wKileTSese were my personal views, I was quite ready, as long as I found him prepared to do substantial justice in • )4 some form, to meet him half way in any reasonable suggestion , 01 to xefer his proposals to Government. In reply he proceeded to fall hack again upon the argument that I had only listened to the Persian version, and had not accepted the statement of the Arabs as recorded in the Istishhad which he had given me. Again I explained to him that such an Istishhad, drawn up as it was by a bunni Mulla, could not be accepted by any British Court or officer, unattested or unsupported, and without an opportunity of cross-examining the persons men tioned therein, and that this opportunity he had at the last minute refused to give me. After some argument he ended by saying that he was now willing to send to nm all the eye-witnesses for examination, but could not agree to send any person who had been concerned in the affray itself. I knew very well that if these witnesses came now they would come thoroughly primed as to what to say; at the same time I did not think it was advisable to give the Sheikh any excuse for saying that I had refused any advance of his and therefore expressed my willingness to hear any one whom he sent me on the morrow, and asked him to send his representative as before. We then took leave. 11 . December 7'^.—Sheikh Ahmed and Shereideh duly presented them selves, together with the persons mentioned on the Istishhad. I proceeded to examine them. Sheikh Hamed was very obstructive at tirst. I had given him a seat on my right facing the witnesses, and he seemed to imagine that 1 was going to let each witness rattle off the statement he had come prepared with, and when I proceeded to elicit their statements by interrogation in the ordinary way, he persistently interrupted with attempts to put words into the witnesses mouths or to prevent them from saying something of a committing nature. I bore with him for some time with a good deal of fongsuffering, but was finally obliged to ask him to sit to one side and behind the witnesses and to reserve his communications and cross-examination of each witness till I had finished with him. This had the desired effect and I was able to carry on uuth less interruption. I examined nine that day and the remaining two the following morning. Copies of their statements are attached (Enclosure 7), but they are worth very little. One and all came in with the idea above mentioned that they would be allowed to rattle o(T the statement which they had evidently been tutored in. I ln any case they were obviously sent there for a purpose, namely, to give proof that it was the Persians who attacked the Arabs, and that was the chief point that they were anxious to make clear. The statements of some of them, however, under examination rather corroborated than otherwise the opposite view and I may point out that in spite of the Sheikh’s argument that it w r as the Arabs who were attacked, not a single j Arab was or has been produced who suffered the slightest injury nor do the | Arab witnesses seriously maintain that any did come to real harm. . The bad sight arising from neglected eye disease of the young man Ramzan / lends probability to the story given by him as to the origin of the fracas, and though it is possible that, after the collision with the Seedie, Ramzan rounded on him and struck the first blow, yet the same bad sight from which Ramzan suffers makes that supposition less probable than the other. There is no doubt, how r ever, that the collision referred to was the origin of | the row, and wh ether the Seedie struck the first blo w or the Persian, we know that in the result two Persians, both perfectly harmless individuals and one a decrepit octogenarian, were very nearly killed, and seven others severely beaten. To one perusing the statements of the witnesses, it will I have no doubt suggest itself in several places that another person mentioned might have been called or that a particular point wanted judicially clearing up. It must be remembered, however, that after each sitting I interviewed Sheikh Esa and that his attitude gave me little reason to hope that my examination of witnesses at all was likely to be anything more than a farce owing to his impossible attitude.5 12. December 8th. —After taking two more statements of persons who had got tired of waiting and had absconded the day before, I proceeded with Captain Prideaux to Muharrag to see the Sheikh. I was prepared for difficulty in bringing him round but not for the change of front which we now experienced. I began by telling him that I had examined all his witnesses as desired and asked hi n what impression his son and Vazier had given him of the nature of their testimony. He replied that they had duly posted him. I then showed him the file of statements that I had brought and asked him whether he would like to have them translated to him now or whether I could leave an interpreter with him to doit at leisure, He said no; he did not want them read or translated, he could call for the men himself if he wanted to hear their statements. I replied that in that case all that remained to be done was for me to give him my opinion on the case; and with his permission I proceeded to do so. 13. I explained that the only point on which the evidence of the Arabs seemed to throw any doubt was as to whether after the collision in the street it was the Persian or the Arab boy who struck the first blow ; that that point did not seem to be of the first importance and was certainly no excuse for the murderous attack which had been made on a whole family including an unfortunate old greybeard who had been innocently wending his way home after his long .Ramzan day in his shop. I continued that in spite of his allegation and the Mullah’s Istishhad to the effect that it was the Arabs who had been attacked and had suffered, not a single wounded man was produced or wound proved, nor was there a trace of any. It was altogether contrary to probability that this one family of merchants and men of peace (Abdu Nabi’s), part of an exceedingly small community of Persians, should for a moment dare to get up a concerted attack upon Arabs in an Arab town of some thousands of inhabitants. I thought there was no getting over the fact that a serious offence had been committed by a number of roughs among his subjects and that it was incum bent upon him as a ruler to set aside his religious prejudices and have adequate justice meted out. v ; 14. I then repeated to him the measures which I had proposed to him before (Enclosure 9) and also repeated that I was prepared to meet him half way in regard to any detail, if he was generally prepared to accept my advice. His reply to this must be noted. “ I have only one answer to give, namely, that I will do nothing in this case except after trial by my own Shariat or Urf Court.” I pointed out to him (as I had done once before when he mentioned the Shariat) that this was no case for the Shariat, especially when the Shariat would be the Sunni Mullahs, Sheikh Jassim and his brother, Sheikh Ahmad, who were themselves more or less mixed up in this affair. I added that in any case in this instance, as he had been told before, the Persians had complained to their Government, which had officially asked us to see justice done, and that he might take my word for it that in this case at all events the British ^ ^ Government would not consider that justice would be done by a reference to the local Mullahs. Moreover, no Mahommedan could be compelled to go to a Shariat Court if he did not wish, and the Persians absolutely refused to take that course. I explained to him that it did not mean, so far as my present informa tion went, taking the Persians out of his jurisdiction altogether. As to his “ Urf ” or Civil Court, I might be excused for reminding him that no properly constituted Court of that nature existed in his territory, and that I could not agree that after what had passed any suitable persons could be found to form one, upon wnose integrity and intention to do justice any confidence could be placed; The Sheikh, however, was quite o bdur ate^ and would give no other answer. Captain Prideaux will bear me wifnegs^ffiaTTwas most patient and quiet with him and continued for a long time endeavouring to persuade him not to come to a deadlock with me, but to agree to any sort of compromise which would showH ^ i t ■ ' ■: : ' i 6 Government that at all events he did not intend to be insubordinate to them even though he could not agree with their representative. I suggested the deposit of even Rs. 1,000 at the Agency and the detention of six of the ringleaders pending reference to Government. But he would have none of it, and added what amounted to this: “ If Government wish to seize Bahrein even, their arm is, long and they can do it; but I will under no circumstances consent to the trial of these Persians by any tribunal but my own courts. 5 * 15. It will thus be seen that he had ceased to argue as to the merits of the case itself, or that only one side had been heard, but had altered his position and was standing out on the question of his jurisdiction over the Persians, a point which he had discussed with Captain Prideaux in the first instance, but had subsequently dropped. Having quite failed to alter his demeanour, I told him I much regretted that we had arrived at a deadlock and could no more than report the fact to Government; and then took leave. We had been with him over two hours. 16. I remained in Bahrein the following day, as it was the Ramzan Eed and it seemed possible that some recrudescence of rowdyism might occur, but all went off quietly and I left for Bushire on 10 th December, leaving H. M. S. Redbreast there. This completes the narrative of the progress of the case. It now remains for me to offer some comment where it seems called for and to make recommenda tions for the future for the consideration of the Government of India. ( 17. Though the Sheikh finally made the question of jurisdiction the bar to any settlement, I doubt myself whether it was really so in fact and think the real state of the case was that, having heard from his son and his Vazier that the Arab witnesses had fallen to pieces in a great measure, and gathering at all events that they had failed to impress me and that he would therefore no longer be able to argue with me regarding the merits of the case itself, and being unfail ing, or junable, owing to the influence of Sheikh Ali and the'Mullahs in Manama, to impose any punishment on the Arabs, he had determined to fall back on the question of jurisdiction. Upon this question of jurisdiction generally I hardly know what the opinion of the Government of India will be. To the best of my belief (and this view is supported offhand by members of the Residency Staff), we have interfered to protect Persians before, but time does not admit of my verifying this from my records before the mail leaves. Personally I unhesitatingly express the view that as we have a virtual Protectorate over Bahrein, it is politically necessary and^ advisable that we should protect Persians (Shiahs), as well as other foreigners, at all events to the extent of preventing the perpetration of iniustice upon them. J In the present case I can hardly doubt, in view of the communications which have passed between this office, the Tehran Legation and the Persian * Enclosures 2, 3 and 4 . Government,* that the Government of India will decide that it is necessary to afford protection. 18. I now come to the attitude of the Sheikh. The personal position, i.e., as between the Sheikh and Resident, is that after agreeing to await my arrival for the settlement of the case, and after pressing me to makepersonMinquiries into it, and after I had been to the trouble of doing as he requested, he absolutely refused to consider the evidence seriously or to meet my views to any extent whatever, and took refuge with a W i hl0 ^ h was insulting, in the question of jurisdiction which and I merIl° U placftt P on record ' aSpe0t ° f ^ qUeSti ° n iS ° f ilnportance - 19. The fact, however, that he should feel able to act in such a way has in t m '? C l m ? r ® smister significance, and my ten days’ enforced^ojoum n \ In Sheikh Esa we have a PiMof tttV~ -l; • i. i .we took the unusual step of recognizing his son Hamed as his heir, in order to strengthen his hands. Considering these facts, and considering also the time that he has been in close relations with a British representative, both he and his son Hamed seem to me to he altogether unable to appreciate either their obligations to the British Government which has fathered them, or their own obligations to themselves as rulers. Sheikh Esa, living as he does over at Maharrag is §CLJE£ak, or so disin clined to bear the sometimes inconvenient responsibilities of a rnler, that his representative in Manama, known as the Bazaar J^astfir, has become necessarily a powerless individual, overawed by Sheikh Ali and those whom he employs or protects, and cannot keep Manama in omer. His son and heir Sheikh Hamed, who, I may mention, is by the same mother as his cousin or half-brother* Sheikh Ali and seems to be personally an .overbearingly ignorant young man, has apparently no better appreciation of his present and prospective position than his father, and does not give much promise of being a more satisfactory Chief. 20 . Sheikh Esa himself is full of years and I am not prepared to say that he is personally or actively willing either that Manama should become lawless, or that specific injustice should be perpetrated, but he is surrounded by evil advisers (e.g., Mahomed Abdul Wahab, Yazier Shereideh, and the Manama Mullahs Jassim and Ahmed), and there cah be little doubt that on the whole he Js a very unsatisfactory ruler, and that Bahrein, as it is now, does the British Government no credit as a principality over which it has for long exercised a virtual protectorate. In fact, I fear that the Itevd. Mr. Zwemer was not very far outside the mark when he wrote five or six years ago, regarding Bahrein :— 4 ‘ Oppression, blackmail and bribery are universal, and except in com merce and the slave trade, English protection has brought about no reforms in the island.*’ 21. The question now to be practically considered is what further action is to be taken in the present case. I can hardly foresee what the decision of the Government of India will be, and can only therefore make suggestions, regard-, ing probable eventualities. If it is decided that we protect these Persians (and I do not see that we can well do otherwise, for if we failed to do so their only safe course would he to leave the island precipitately), then I fear that there is no amicable way out of the difficulty ; we shall have to coerce the Sheikh Esa. If it is determined to take that course, to what extent is it to be done ? I think we should gain little by deposing Sheikh Esa and putting up his son Hamed, for the latter is I fear too old now to be moulded in any way, and if left to himself will certainly be as unsatisfactory as his father. Short of proclaiming a full British Protectorate which might perhaps create alarm at the present time the ohTy course would be to select one of the sons of Sheikh Esa’s deposed Uncle, Mahommed-bin-Khalifa, of whom there are many living and some said to be promising. The deportment of Esa and his sons and the appointment of a son of Mahommed with a binding treaty with us would be a simple matter, but again, such a step may perhaps not suit the policy of Government at this juncture. Bailing that, the only alternative is to make the best of Esa and to coerce him in the present case by obliging him to carry out my terms or the decision of Government in the matter and to pa£ a fine in addition for his refractory behaviour. We might also threaten to replace him by one of Mahommed-bin- Khalifa’s descendants. 22. Captain Prideaux is of opinion, and there is I think something in it, that the Sheikh had perhaps become alarmed at the change of Agents at Bahrein, and had connected it with a determination of the Govern ment of India to t ape over his Customs, and this has inclined him to stand on ♦ Kotb.—T he mother wa» first married to AH’s father.

C.the defensive in this recent matter and form common cause with Sheikh Ali and that for this reason oar disinterestedness ^might be suspected if the taking over of his Customs was allowed to become an item of our punitive treat ment of him in the present connection. I admit that there is force in this. On the other hand, if we are going to coerce the Chief, it would save a good deal of trouble to include the Customs question and have done with it, seeing that it has been troubling us so long. 1 must leave the question in the hands of the Government of India. 23. I now only have to discuss the means of coercion. The position in ^ this connection is not quite so simple as it was when coercive action was last taken at Bahrein. There is now a considerable community of Europeans in Manama, viz., 12 or 15 Missionaries and two or three European traders, besides our Political Agent. In connection with the present case, the Sheikh who has no doubt been instigated all through by the Mullahs Jassim and Ahmed, could if he liked arouse a good deal of fanatical feeling in the matter and this has to be taken into account. I do not think it would be advisable to propose any fresh terms or settlement to him without having at hand the means to enforce them on the spot, and at present we have not got them. H M. S. Redbreast, manned as she now is with a lascar crew and carrying only seven or eight bluejackets, would be of no use for any work on shore. In my opinion if it were intended to coerce the Sheikh or depose him it would be advisable and necessary to have a second ship of war present and to send a battalion of native infantry or at all events four companies to Bahrein to camp for the re-d of the winter on the open ground outside the Agency, for the reassurance and safeguarding of the European community and of British subjects in general, until matters had settled down. 24. Although as I observed before I cannot foresee what view Government will take of this case ab initio I have thought it advisable to write fully on all points which seem at all likely to be involved. I may add that Captain Prideaux’s views coincided entirely with mine throughout in regard to the attitude of the Sheikh, and when we parted neither of us had any hope that any solution short of coercion was possible. Writing to me the day after my departure he mentioned that he had nothing fresh to report, “ only that the Sheikh has closed all the coffee shops in the centre of the Bazaar, professedly to lessen the chances of disturbance, but * i.c., on our advice on 7th December. actually because they are ( P. z. cox. run by Persians who have only just* opened after a closure of three weeks. The Arab coffee shops are nearer the outskirts of the town and have been allowed to keep open.” This is only another instance of his hostile attitude towards the Persian community. 25. There is one aspect of the question which I forgot to indicate in its proper place. I venture therefore to do so now. It bears on the question of the pro tection of this Community of Persians. The matter, as mentionM in the body of the report, has already been dis cussed at Tehran. If then jwe see substantial justice done to these subjects of the Shah, the fact of our having done so will, now and always, greatly strengthen the hands of His Majesty's Legation, in pressing claims of ours and as an ins tance of our general friendliness to the Shah’s Government and subjects. The converse would also be the case. 28. In an analogous connection with the above I may mention that I have this moment received an informal note from my German Colleague Herr Yon Mutius regretting that owing to my being in quarantine he cannot see me personally m order to present you my best thanks for your efficient help to the German firm, which, I trust, settles the case.” 27. I have omitted also^ to mention that supposing that the Government of India agree to tae deportation of Sheikh Ali (which I look upon as of the firstimportance) I recommend that the period should he not less than five years, if not for an indefinite period. 28. I beg to state in conclusion that this report has occupied me up to ^ t he last minute of the mail steamer’s presence, being typed sheet by sheet straig ht from my pen ; 1 shall consequently not be able to revise or alter anything, if it is to catch the mail, and this seems important. I therefore crave indulgence for any clerical errors or loose English of which I may have been guilty. Enclosure No. 1. No. 270, dated 17th November 1904. From— Captain F. B. Prideaux, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to report that on the evening of Monday, the 14th instant, a most serious assault was committed by th e servants of Sheikh All bin Ahmed al Khalifah and other Arabs on the family of Haji Abdul Nabf ICazerooni and other innocent Persians who chanced to fall in their way, with the result that two respectable Persians—the father and brother of Abdul Nabi—have been dangerously wounded and seven other Persians less seriously so. 2. The facts of the case, as reported by my Arab Munshi after thorough enquiry, are as follows. The disturbance arose through a Persian servant of Haji Abdul Nabi and a Negro servant of Sh eikh Ali bin Ahrqed brushing against each other in a narrow lane oT tne Eazaarunmtentionally. 'The Negro Marjook, turned furiously on the Persian Ramzan, and after the exchange of a few sentences knocked him down. Seeing other Persians about, he flew at them, using his stick freely, and in a few moments others of his companions had commenced copying his example. Haji Abdul Nabi, who is thn monopolist of the cargo-landing business, the contract for which he holds Mder the Chief’s Wazier Abdur Rahman, came running up to subdue the disturbance, but his influence failed to stand him in good stead, and he found himself compelled to flee back to his house to save his life. By this time a number of Sunnis had joined in the excitement conlingout of an adjacent mosque, the Mullah of which ' was urging them to “kill, kill the moguls” and a number of others, including 1 Sheikh plaij bin Selman al Khalifa, whose three intimate relatives were the ? persons killed by the Begaih on the mainland m 1900, also came up from the house of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed, who is said to have hurried them forward though he kept out of sight himself. 3. Haji Abdul Nabi, pursued by an infuriated mob, was able to find safety in the midst of women, but his old father, aged 80 years, and his brother were caught, dragged out of the house and most brutally assaulted. Ihe other Persians injured were mere onlookers, and it is a noticeable fact that no Arabs were at all seriously hurt, though at the present moment an “ Istishhad ” is being circulated for signature amongst Arabs to the effect that the Persians were the aggressors and that a number of Arabs too have been hurt. 4. On receiving news of the affair, which did not last long in an active state owing to the flight of all the Persians from the streets, I immediately requested Dr. Thoms of the Arabian Mission, my medical attendant, to look at the injured men, and a copy of his report is attached for your information. I also sent word to Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed that I wished to see him, and he came round to the Agency at about 9 p.m„ after eating his food. I found him in out ward appearance considerably upset at the contretemps and certainly somewhat nervous as to the consequences. X told him that I was astonished at the want of control under which his servants apparently existed, not only because the Resident’s decision regarding th e previous case in which they had been con* co rned , when Mir. Bahnson, the German, was hurt, had not been announced, buTalso because two or three days ago I had sent him as well as other Sheikhs, who reside in the Manamah Bazaar, a private message through Haji Abbas to the effect that the Chief had written to me that he did not approve of the “Sukhra” (corve) system, and that therefore if cases of flagrant tyranny in connection with it occurred in the future the perpetrators were unlikely to get support from Sheikh Isa.-r/i It 10 5 . Sheikh Ali commenced by denying that he received my message and also that the ringleaders, whom I named, were his servants. He said _that the whole power to punish even his own (Sheikh Ah s) followers was wielded by the Chief Sheikh Isa, and he further alleged that if Sheikh Isa would have per mitted it, he would have been glad to have tried to settle the case with the Germans amicably out of Court. At the end of our interview he promised to send five of the ringleaders over to Moharrag, where Sheikh Isa resides, early on the following morning. 6 Durino* the night Sheikh Isa sent one of his head servants to Haji Abdul Nath’s house and told him to rest assured that satisfaction would be given him. 7 . In the morning, unaware of the last incident, I called on the Chief and sent word also to such°of the sufferers as could move, to be present at the same time. I believe that Sheikh Ali must also have been to the Chief before my arrival, for I found Sheikh Isa’s attitude at first most obstinate. He declared that he would not admit any interference from me in cases between Arabs and Persians who were all IVfahommedans, and said that he had made up his mind to have the present case settled by a Shara Court. I urged him to the best of my ability to hold the enquiry to himself as no Sunni Shara Court was in the least likely to do justice to Persians, and moreover the conduct of more than one of the A1 Khalifa family was seriously in question. I then observed that if the Chief ignored my advice in this matter he would be afterwards sorry for it, just as I was sure he would regret not having allowed Sheikh Ali to compound the case which the Germans were pressing against him. fihe Chief replied that he had heard nothing of any advice given by me to Sheikh AH, and when I told him that I had said that I thought that if Sheikh Ali wrote Mr. “Wonckhaus an apology of his own initiative and offered a fair sum of money as compensation to Mr. Bahnson, the Germans would not be backward in burying the hatchet; the Chief showed considerable signs of interest, and enquired what sum in my opinion would be acceptable to the German firm. This question I did not see my way to answer. The Chief at the close of our interview, in which other matters were also discussed, reiterated his declaration that justice would be done to the Persians, and J contented myself with saying that I should follow the course of the enquiry with interest. I must not omit to mention that at the beginning of our interview the Chief declared he would not admit the wounded Persians into his presence, but before I left he did see them. 8 . On my return to my house I heard that the two chief ringleaders had again just been assaulting Persians in the Bazaar, that all the Persians in consequence were keeping their shops closed and that Sheikh Ali’s men were patrolling the streets in bands of 10 and 15 on the lookout for casual Persians. I therefore sent Haji Abbas back again at once to the Chief with this news and a message that if any further harm was done, he himself could not possibly be absolved from blame. I repeated a suggestion that I had made that Sheikh Ali should be ordered to reside in Moharrag, during the month of Bamzan, and that the Chief should send over some of his own immediate followers from Moharrag to police the Manamah Bazaar streets. The Chief sent me back word that he would see that no further trouble occurred, and also that he had after all decided to hold the enquiry himself. He did not,*, however, follow the advice I had given him as mentioned above. 9. Yesterday, Wednesday, the Persians’ shops remained closed and Sheikh Ali’s men continued behaving as before. To-day news has been brought to me that Sheikh Isa has sent a message to Haji Abdul Nabi that as be appealed to me for help he need expect no consideration from himself. The Persian sufferers have all been told that they must attend the Shara Court, and the Persian community in general are to be fined Rs. 5,000 for keeping their shops closed. 10. In these circumstances I have not considered it desirable to postpone my report to you until the advent of the next up mail steamer, which is due in three or four days, but I am sending this letter by a buggalow, specially provided by the Persian community.11 \ W ,'W 11. The man responsible for this outbreak, I am convinced, is Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed. You are aware that his tather until his death unofficially shared ■with Sheikh Isa in the Government of the Islands. He lived in the large house on the sea shore in Manamah city which is still recognized as “ Govern ment House ” and occupies the whole of one side of the open square in which the Saluting Gun lies, and close to the Customs office and general landing stage. This house is now the property of Sheikh Ali who took great offence at Sheikh Isa’s appointing his son Sheikh Hamad to succeed to his father’s posi- tiraT instead of himself. To console himself for the slight which he considered put upon him, Sheikh Ali has formed around his person a bodyguard of big men, mostly Negros who are a terror to all quietly disposed residents in the Bazaar and whom I believe no man in the Chief’s entourage dares touch. Nearly all the men who are implicated in the Bahnson affair have now also taken part in this more recent case. It may be that Sheikh Isa is unwilling to sCe the family dignity injured through the punishment even of a nephew who is disloyal to himself, but I firmly believe now that my predecessor Mr. Gaskin’s view is also correct that the Chief dare not attempt to exercise fiieikh Ali. The fact that Sheikh Ali is disloyal at any rate in Agency to welcome my arrival, that if he had the share in the Government which his father had held he would be happy to use his influence towards the proper reformation of the Customs Administration. 12. I now have to make the following recommendations. In the absence of a British gunboat it is certain that no punitive measures will be submitted to by Sheikh Ali and his gang, either in the Wonckhaus case or the present one. I hope that as quickly as possible a gunboat may be sent here, and, if possible, allowed to remain here during the month of Ramzan, as I am not too confident that even the Hindu community will be safe much longer. 13. I think that on the arrival of the man-of-war, Sheikh Ali should be summond on board with all his male servants. Mr. Bahnson might be invited on board and asked to identify the men who were concerned in the assault on himself. All such, who may be known to have taken part also in the later affair, should be soundly flogged on board, then sent to Moharrag for one year’s imprisonment, and then expelled from the Islands in the event of security for good behaviours not being forthcoming. I think such action on our part as this is justified by the Chief’s weakness and actively wrongful attitude. 14. Sheikh Ali should he banished from Bahrein, and preferably made to reside at Aden, for at least ten years. His brothers can administer his properties and remit him the proceeds. The old “ Government House” should however be made over at a valuation to the Chief for the use of his son Sheikh Hamad. 15. Finally, Sheikh Isa, I think, should be told emphatically that no disputes between Shiahs and Sunnis are henceforth to be referred to the Shara Court, any more than disputes between Hindus and Mahommedans are. The Shiahs, who are mostly Persians, in the absence of the Shah’s Consular representatives naturally look to us for protection, and as the British Government are interested in the welfare of all classes in Bahrein, they cannot view with equanimity the injustice even of making Bahrein Shiahs (who are all Persian by origin) submit to the jurisdiction of a religious Court other than their own. All such cases should be adjudicated upon by the Chief himself or by an impartial Mejlis. From— Dr. S. J. Thoms, M.D., Surgeon to the Arabian Mission and the British Assistant Political Agency, Bahrein, To— Captain F. B. Prideattx, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein. I saw nine of the wounded Persians you asked me to see and found two of them in a critical condition from their wounds. Some of the others were badly bruised and cut, but not sufficiently to endanger life. Mahomed bin Rathi has four very bad scalp wounds and his back is one mass of bruises. He had been having fever for some days before he was wounded which makes his condition much more critical. uncle is proved by his saying to me, when he called at the Dated 15th November 1904.12 Haji Kelanazi has six scalp wounds, a compound fracture of one of the hctnes of the hand and various bruises on his body, mainly on his back. He is in a semi-comatose condition, and on account of his age, which is probably above eighty, his condition is quite critical. Enclosure No. 2. Telegram dated the 23rd November 1904. From— Captain A. P. Trevor, First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—E velyn Grant Dupf, Esq., His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires, Tehran. News received that serious affray took place at Bahrein between Arabs and Persians in which former were aggressors. Several Persians were wounded. Our Political Agent is demanding punishment of offenders and compensation, and I am sending gunboat to support his demands. 1 hear that the Persians have complained to their Government by telegraph, and so let you have this information.

The Persian traders in Bahrein. I received your telegram regarding the assault on you by the Bahrein Arabs. Keep yourselves calm for I have had a long talk with the British Minister on the subject and I am sure he will take early steps to get the affair settled and get the culprits punished. Enclosure No. 5. No. 272, dated 19th November 1904. From — Captain F. B. Prideaux, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In continuation of my letter No. 270, dated the 17th instant, I have the 1 honour to report that the Persian shops are still closed in the Manamah Bazaar, and the Persians who have been summoned to the 8 hara Court, have refused to appear there. T^ey state that it was Sheikh Jassim himself, the leading Mullah in the Islands, who sent the worshippers out of his mosque to join in the affray, and that if they appear before him, as they have been ordered to do, it is a foregone conclusion that they will be found guilty of having commenced the disturbance and will be sentenced to punishments of flogging or imprison ment. 2 . I believe it is a fact that Sheikh Jassim is a friend of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed, and that he is not very loyal to the Chief of Bahrein. The latter only sends cases to him for settlement when he is anxious to wash his own hands of all connection with them. 3. Sheikh Isa is aware of the despatch of my last letter to you by Buggalow and he has now concurred in my suggestion that the settlement should stand over until the receipt of your orders. At the same time Sheikh Ali’s followers are still parading the streets in force, and I do not consider the situation will reieitto normal until the arrival of a man-of-war here. I omitted in my last letter to say that Sheikh Ali did not fulfil his promise to me about sending v. 16 ! ? lu »^ ea 4 ers over Moharrag and he has recently sent me word that he biohe this promise because Sheikh Jassim, the Mullah, had ordered him not to cany out my request. This excuse I do not accept as satisfactory.H « 18 4 . With regard to the suggestions for punishment that I made in my last letter, I wish to observe that I do not believe there will be any difficulty about getting Sheikh Isa to acquiesce iu them. There are more than one precedent in the records of your office to show that orders for the banishment of indivi duals or the infliction of fines have been submitted to without protest or delay. Moreover, the Chief is so weak and afraid of a portion of his subjects that he is »lad to be able to tell them that his actions are prompted by jorce majeure. I am aware that in regard to the Customs question the Government of India do not wish to gain their ends directly by compulsion, but in the present cases, if our authority is not unhesitatingly vindicated, our prestige will be lowered not only here, but probably in the entire length of the Arab Coast. In these circumstances I earnestly hope that you will be able to see your way to author izing the adoption of strong measures as quickly as possible. Enclosure No. 6 . Statements of Persian Subjects. Deposition. No. 1. Kal {i.e. Karbelai) Ahwaz states on solemn affirmation :—I was in my shop in the afternoon in question, and, having heard from my son Abdu Nabi that my servants were being beaten, I closed my shop and went towards my house, but was overtaken and assaulted. I was knocked down in the street by a crowd of Arabs. They hit me on the head, body, and arms, and I fell insen sible, and when I came to I found myself in my house. Note .—This witness, a very old man, aged about 80, was brought in on a litter He was in a very critical state and not in a fit condition to be cross- examined or give further evidence. I therefore, sent him away, fearing that the ordeal might kill him. No. 2. Haji Abdul Nabi bin Kal Ahwaz, son of last witness (No. 1), on^ solemn affirmation :—I am a business man. My chief work is as Hamal Bashi for the Sheikh of Bahrein. I am also in the employment of Gray Paul &amp; Co. in con nection with the lighter service. I am also Dubash for the British Navy in Bahrein. My age is about 85. I was in the Customs Warehouse (Amara) in the afternoon about (10 Arabic) = (4 p.m. English). Two of my nephews, Ali and Rahkhuda, came and told me that my employ^ and weighing man, Ramzan, had been killed in the bazaar by being beaten to death by Arabs. I thereupon ran to the bazaar and found a crowd of people mobbing Ram zan, who was under their feet. I called out and asked them why they were beatino- my servant. They then caught me by the collar and said, “ Let u s take him to°Ali bin Ahmed (the Sheikh’s nephew). They then dragged me a few yards out of the bazaar, when we met Mansoor bin Khairullah, acting Bazaar Master, who rescued me from their hands. I then went unmolested to my father’s shop and found it closed and my father just on the way to his house. I joined him. On the way we met Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed r s negro Bakheit el Nubi, who pretended to pacify me and to make little of what had happened and joined us himself. Close to my house is a mosque called Musjid-i-Juma. As we approached it, I noticed a lar^e gathering of Arabs armed with sticks, daggers, and swords standing in the 3 road. Bakheit held up his hands in a deprecatory way, ostensibly as if to say to them “ Let them alone, ” and called out, “ Balakum Balakum, ” i. e., “ Take care, take care. ” I think, however, that it must really have been a prearranged sign because they immediately made an assault upon us. They hit me on my hands and arms upraised for self-protection, as I tried to escape. They caught hold of my cloak, which came away from my shoulders, and I escaped to the house of Ali bin Kazim-Bushiri.There was no male in the house, and I went to the women’s quarter. Two men from the mob followed me with drawn swords. I do not know their names, but I can recognise them. They beat me with the flat of tlieir swords and said ** Let us take him to Ali bin Ahmed.” I said, “ All right, I will go.” I came as far as the threshold. Then I thought to myself that they might kill me and ran back into the house among the women. The same two men followed me and were trying to drag me out when the women began to scream and a man entered [Mahomed bin Surhan (Arab), their next door neighbour, a servant of Ali bin Ahmed] and took the two assailants out and left me in the house and the door was closed. One of the two as«ailants was an Abyssinian slave of Ali bin dthmed and the other is his servant (i.e,, Ali’s servant). I remained there till three hours after sunset, when Dr. Thoms and Mr. Lobo at the Consul’s request came to see after me. They informed me that my father and brother had been very severely wounded. The only reason I can think for this occurrence and the assault upon my employe is that it is I as Hamal Bashi, who have had to detect and demand the punishment of persons who rob from the lighters and the Customs House. They have not threatened me openly, but their object is to dome harm with the Sheikh and get me out. I have little or nothing to do witli Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed personally. After the affray, during the night, Sheikh Isa’s negro came to me from his master. He asked me to overlook what had happened and assured me from the Sheikh that the culprits would be adequately punished. I showed the messenger the critical state of my father and brother, and he was very much shocked and went away to report. In the morning I went with Captain Prideaux to the Sheikh to Moharrag. I took the wounded men in a separate boat. I saw the Sheikh in Captain Pri- deaux’s presence. The Sheikh' suggested that we should go to the Shariat. I demurred against going to the Shariat on the grounds his nephew Ali bin Ahmed in conjunction with the Mullahs Sheikh Jassim and Sheikh Ahmed bin Mahzar had ordered the assassination of the Persians and put up the assault on us and these same Mullahs are the “ Shariat, ” My reason for saying this was that Mullah Sheikh Ahmed and Sheikh Beraini, his brother, were standing among the mobout&gt;ide the mosque looking on, and even the women came out with sticks or pestles and Sheikh Ali’l servants were mixed up in it as well. I never agreed to go to the Shariat for a moment. Bin Jilal, the Sheikh’s servant, did come to me the third day after the occurrence and wanted to take me to Sheikh Jassim, but I refused and informed Captain Prideaux that I had done so. There is no Mullah here whose decision or arbitration we as Shias could possibly accept in this vital case. Evidence taken in the presence of the Sheikh’s Vazier Shereideh, who has no further questions to put. Witness recalled 6 th December 1904 :—It is quite true I have a revolver. I got it about three months ago from a man in Moharrag The reason was this. I ran down some robbers three months ago—Arabs from Bussorah—who had been committing several robberies, 8 were imprisoned, 3 are still (in prison ?) and 5 were released and expelled. Being in fear of my life on this account, I bought a revolver in Moharrag and got a country-man of mine, named Ali Manomed, always to walk about with me and to sleep in my house Ali is a poor man, working hard for his living and lodging next door, so I selected him m order to give him a job. My sight is too bad for me to use a revolver myself, and, moreover, I know nothing about fire-arms or the use of them. L cannot recognise anybody at more than 3 or 4 yards, and in the daytime I always wear glasses. My eyes were operated on in Bushire a short time ago, but I have derived no benefit from it.

Some time ago about 11 Arabic (an hour before sunset) I went from myshop to my house to say my prayers, and while returning I was informed that there was a fight going (on ?) between Arabs and Persians, in which Abdu Nabi was included. I reached my shop safely and closed it (or told my boys to close it) and then turned to go home again. On the way I saw my father and brother passing together with my younger brother Mahmud. They were on their way home. I did not speak to them or join them, as I wanted to go and buy some fruit. After doing so I went in the direction of my house. When I arrived near the Musjid-i-Juma, I saw numbers of people running here and there. On getting nearer, the Musjid people set upon me from both sides. There was a great number of people. They were Arabs including Sidis. They beat me with sticks and large pestles on the shoulders and bead without any words or /my warning. I was felled to the ground and became insensible. Some one carried me to my house and I came to consciousness afterwards when the doctor was dressing my head. I still feel giddy when I sit up and have been incapa citated from work ever since. My right hand is cut and now bound up. I do not know how the wound was inflicted. I know no reason for all this. The attack was so sudden that I could not swear to any of my assailants. No cross-examination. Note .—This witness’s skull turned out to he fractured, but he is progress ing favourably. No. 4. Ramzan bin Ghulam, Persian, duly affirmed, statesMy age is about 20 . I am employed by Abdu Nabi. On the afternoon in question I was in the Amarah and then went to the bazaar to buy fish. Before I had reached the fish shop, I had to pass through a very narrow part of the bazaar.^ ^y sight is very bad (note one eye is evidently quite blind and the left half blind), and I ran up against a man by mistake who was standing in the street. He abused me, and when I asked him why he did so, he assaulted me severely with his fists. I could not recognise him then and do not now know who he is. The time was evening, when many people are always collected, especially in Bamzan (about 2 hours before sunset). The Arabs present assisted him of their own accord and joined in the assault upon me. They knocked me down time and after time, I trying to escape. At last I took refuge in a ruined house and hid myself, and they lost me and left me. A Persian named Haji Hassan says he saw the occurrence. No cross-examination. No. 5. Haji Hassan bin Mahomed Ali states on solemn affirmation:—A few days ago in the evening I was in the bazaar buying sweetmeats. I saw Ramzan, a Persian, who was passing, run into some one. The street is narrow and he ran by mistake into the man, who was an Arab. I did not know who the Arab was, but I can recognise him. He was a youth, beardless and wheat colour. The Arab turned round and caught hold of Ramzan and abused him. Ramzan said he did not mean to do it, and that the street was narrow. He (Ramzan) said, “ Is there no justice in the town that you hustle me without reason ?” Then other people came up and beat Ramzan. I made myself scarce for fear of being beaten too and saw no more. I closed my shop and went to my house. No cross-examination. No. 6 . Adulla bin Haji Ali Reza, aged 20, states on solemn affirmation :—I am a servant of Kal Ahwaz. . On the evening of the day in question about £ hour before sunset I was taking bread from the bazaar to the house of my master Kal Ahwaz, when I was attacked by about 12 persons with loaded sticks and walking sticks and wounded on the head, face, arms, etc., I fell down under the blows. While I was down and they beating me, a Bahreini came and separated them, and I got up and made my escape. I don’t know the man’s name, whohelped me, nor should I recognise him, as I was hit between the eyes and they were full of blood. I can’t identify any of the Arabs and Sidis who struck me, except one. The first blow was from a negro named Marzuk. He is a loafer. I don’t know whom he belongs to. 1 can’t recognise any of the others. The first blows were on my head and knocked me silly. The mission doctor attended me. I am still sick.

There were a great lot of them, Arabs and Sidis. When I went up, they hit me on the head and arms. I received about six blows; after that I became insensible. I remember four persons striking me. The names of the two are :— (1) Marzuk bin Zaid, a loafer Sidi boy. (2j Saad bin (?) an Arab, also a loafer. I could recognise the other two, one is Marzuk’s brother, the other a rela tion of Marzuk. I believe I was carried on a donkey to my house by one Sadiq, but have no recollection. I was insensible for two days and was attended by the mission doctor.

I was about to close the shop for the day (one of Haji Ahwaz’s five shops), when I heard that Ramzan was being killed. I ran for the spot, but when I got as far as Abdu Reza Howani’s shop, I was assaulted by three persons fromja crowd. They hit me over the head with sticks, and I fled towards Kal Ahwaz’s house; but before going there, I lay low on the seashore till all was quiet. The men who struck me were negros.

Abdu NabBs servant got loose and reached the boys and they began fighting; a lanre number of Arabs, I can’t say how many, were collected there.

They were like masons. They went silently altogether. No one that I recognised was with them. Afterwards they came back about 10 minutes later, and Arabs were with them. The Arabs were frightened and running away and Persians followm® them' There were not more than 50 persons or slightly under. When I saw them i e the Perdans, they were beating the Arabs.

The first that I saw was that Abdu Nabi passed my shop with many Persians. I only know one who had a revolver. I can t say why I noticed him, only I closed my shop and went away. Nobody told me the word ce Hewarwar,” although I usually know the weapon as “fard.” Abdu Nabi had a stick in his hand and so had the others. They passed me and I saw no more. I was subsequently sent for by Sheikh Ahmed with the other people. I don t know what day, but about 10 days ago. They asked me what I knew and I said I saw Abdu Nabi in the bazaar in front of his servants saying to them “ Buzan, Buzan, el Faloos fel bet . 55 He said these exact icords.

In the afternoon I said my “asr’’ prayers in the mosque called “Jumaan” and afterwards went to the Persian bazaar and sat outside a Halwa shop. X bad no business there particularly. I sat talking to a friend, Ahmed bin Haji Abdulla. I sat there about 3 hours or 3| hours. The name of the owner of the shop was Haji Abdulla and Ahmed, his son abovementioned. No one else was sittiuo- there. While there I sa w Abdu Nabi’s weighing boy standing near the Halwa shop. He was doing nothing particular. Another boy an Arab passed him and ran against him. The servant of Abdu Nabi caught hold of the Arab boy by the neck.^ The Arab boy had his brother with him and they both closed with the Persian. This was quite close to me. I went up and interfered and stopped them. Ihey none of them had sticks, but small canes, which they used, but did not hurt one another. After I separated them, they went away. After 15 minutes later Abdu Nabi came himself from the Amara. He abused the two Arabs who had quarrelled with his servant. I do not know the Arabs* names. I should recognise them if I saw them. The Arabs did not return the abuse. Abdu Nabi then went to the Amara at least I suppose so as he brought hack workmen with him. He was away about J hour. When he came back, he was with his workmen walking in front of them. He had nothino* in his hands, but ordered his men to “ Bezan ” strike. He meant to strike four or five Arabs who were sitting there, including the two hoys who had quarrelled with his servant. They did not kill any Arab in my presence, nor did I see any wounded or hurt. They then left the bazaar. I returned to my house. I saw no more of the disturbance, nor did I see any one wounded, but I heard there was a row in the street, but was not curious enough to go and s 'e it. I was subsequently called by Mansoor bin Kheir Allah (last Priday, December 2nd) to Sheikh Ahmed’s house afternoon prayers. Yazier She- reideh was present, and others whom they had collected for testimony. Mullah Sheikh Ahmed bin Mahzar took my statement. Salman Megu wrote it. They asked me what had happened.

I remember the disturb- ance at the beginning of Bamzam I was in my shop that afternoon and bavin 0, closed my shop was about to go to my house. While going there, I found^ Abdu Nabi with some Persians near the Persian shops. I saw about 9 men. Abdu Nabi had nothing in his hand. His servant Aliyan had a revolver in his hand, and others had sticks. I can see well (Ids eyes look as if he could not see, being very opaque). AH was holding up the revolver. He did not lire it. He and the men with him were running. Abdu Nabi was ahead and calling out “ Bezan, Bezan,” referring to the Arabs, about 8 or 9 who were there. I saw the Persian strike a negro domestic named Saad bin Perhan bn Khairallah. Abdu Nabi called out, “ Kill him : his blood money is in my box.” I passed on and went home. They hit him with sticks, but did not hurt him severely, 3 or 4 blows. I saw no more until I got home. I was only called to Sheikh Ahmed’s house last Priday (December 2nd). I gave the same statement as I have given now. No. 17. Hassan Mohammed, Arab, aged 30, states on solemn affirmation :—1 am a grocer. I remember the disturbance at the beginning of Ramzan. I was sitting in my shop in the evening. Ali, the servant of Abdu Nabi, passed my shop. He was accompanied by 5 or 6 Bushiris, labourers ; he was at their head and had a revolver in his hands, the others had sticks. They were hurrying along. Ali did not fire his revolver before me. In front of my shop they struck a boy named Queran bin Saad an Arab. I don’t know why they struck him. They gave him one or two blows and be bolted. After I saw this I closed my shop and went to my bouse, fearing some disturbance. I was sent for to Sheikh Ahmed’s house last Priday ( 2 nd December). Sheikh Ahmed and Shereideh were present, and took down something of what I said. No cross-examination. No. 18, Ahmed bin Kazim, Bahreini, aged 35, rice dealer, states on solemn affirm ation I remember the day of the disturbance, about 5 or 6 days from begin ning of Ramzan, I was in my shop towards sunset selling rice. I heard people who were coming from the bazaar towards my shop speaking of a row. They said, “ There was a disturbance at the house of Kal Awaz; people were beating the boy of Kal Awaz.” I did not move from my shop. I heard no more and saw no more. As I was sitting there, I saw the masons of Abdu Nabi going into the bazaar. I did not know where they were going. They were going fast, and Abdu Nabi’s servant—I don’t know his name—was in front of them. Abdu Nabi was not there. I do not know where he was. I subsequently closed my shop, fearing it might be robbed, and went towards the Musjid Juma, andon the way I heard that Abdu Nabi and his father and his brother and another (four in all) had been killed by (zagirt ruffians). I went onin that direction, thinking I might be able to help Mahomed Reza (Abdu Nabi’s brother), perhaps by carrying him home or in any other way. There was no one at the Musjid. The row had stopped and the wounded men had been removed to their houses. I then went home. I did not see any one wounded then, but next day I saw Abdu Rahim Kal Awaz’s servant and he was wounded, and also another man related to Husseinu, whose name I do not know. I did not see the beginning of the row. I know no more. I did not see what was in the hands of Abdu Nabi’s masons. I went to Sheikh Ahmed's last Friday with the others. No further cross-examination. No. 19. Hussein Mahomed, Arab, aged 25 : states on solemn affirmation : I remember the occasion of the disturbance ; it was 5 or 6 days from the beginning of Ramzan. I am a butcher and have a shop in the meat bazaar. I went to the Halwa shops, but had not bought anything. I saw a crowd quarrelling near the shop of Muallim. There were 7 or 8 persons. When I just saw them, each man had his string of beads in his hands. They were saying prayers over them and saying, “Subhan Allah, Subhan Allah.’* They then began to quarrel. I looked on. I saw a servant of Abdu Nabi’s, a boy with a blind eye, standing there. Another boy, an Arab, passed him and gave a pull at his coat. Abdu Nabi*s servant turned round and hit the other boy with his fist in the neck. They thereupon closed upon one another. Upon this the servants of Kal Awaz (father of Abdu Nabi) came out. The servant Ghulum (of Abdu Nabi) tried to stop the two hoys, but the other servant hit the Arab boy, who had pulled the blind youth’s coat with a stick. The Arab youth fell down. They were separated by other Arabs who had by now collected. At this time Abdu Nabi was standing near Muallim’s shop. Abdu Nabi had a mason with him, whose name I do not know, a Persian. Abdu Nabi cried out “ Bezan ” to the blind boy and to the mason. They went on ahead of Abdu Nabi, calling out “ Bezan, Bezan” strike, strike ; and anyone they met they beat. They had in their hands thick canes from Bombay. The blind boy, when he first quarrelled with the Arab boy, had a thin stick in his hand, but afterwards used bigger sticks which they fetched from the house of Abdu Nabi, about 400 yards away. I now say I don’t know whether Abdu Nabi was in his house or in the Amara or elsewhere. After the two boys were separated, Abdu Nabi’s one- eyed boy went away and came back with Abdu Nabi and about 15 labourers (masons). They all had sticks. They began to beat Arabs and anybody they saw in the bazaar. I went to my house. I got accidentally touched by one stick on the way, but whether it was the stick of a Persian or an Arab I can not say. I made myself scarce when the beating began. Beyond the 15 or 20 Persians I cannot say at all how many people there were there altogether, whether there were 2 J or i ,000 or how many. On above being read over to him, he says besides the 15 masons there were other Persians collected from their shops, he cannot say how many, nor can he say how many people there were, but there were a large number. Asked if he saw anybody badly hurt, he says he saw two Arabs lying in the road with blood on their faces. He did not help them. He does not know^who they were. I went to Mullah Sheikh Ahmed with the others last Friday. Asked by Sheikh Hamad if he saw a revolver, he replies, “Punishment after death is severe; I cannot say I saw any revolver.” No. 20. Mahomed Ali bin Buzzeizi, Arab, aged 40, states on solemn affirmation I work with my father, who has a grocer’s shop in the bazzar. I came here yesterday with the other witnesses. I had work and I saw that there were plenty of other witnesses to be examined. I therefore went away and told Mansur bin Khairullah that I was going to be acquiesced. This morning Vazier Shereideh met me in the bazaar and told me to come to the Agency* 3301 F D22 I remember the disturbance that took place at the beginning of the month (Ramzan). On that day I said my asr prayers in the Musjid of Jumaan, in which the leader is Mullah Sheik Abdul Wahab, son of Mullah Sheikh Jasim. After prayers I went to my shop and did some writing up to about 10-30 Arabic. Then I went to the fish-market to buy some fish. Before I got there I saw a crowd of Arabs and asked what was up, and they replied that there was a row on. This was near a shop formerly occupied by a Jew named Razal. I forget who is there cow. I stopped there half an hour and looked on. At first the Arabs went away and the quarrel was apparently over. There was a large ^ number, 80 or so/ One man, who had been the beginning of the quarrel, was taken away by the Arabs. He was a mulvallad named Saad bin Khairullah. I saw them taking him away. I did not see the beginning of the quarrel. I did not see any other people. After they had gone, I stopped where I was talking to a bystander whose name I did not know, about the row. While I was talking I saw some Persians coming along, 8 or 9, of whom I knew 3, namely, Ramzan, Mahomed Rahim, and one Sadiq. They were running after the Arabs and wanted to reach Saad bin Khairullah. A man named Saad Gahtani put himself in front of them and tried to stop them. They declined and said they were going to have it out with the Arabs of whom there were 8 or 9 still standing about. Saad could not stop rhem, and they got among the Arabs. I am an Arab myself, but I was not afraid for myself. It was only those who had quarrelled with them that they wanted, the 8 or 9 who were waiting there and others who were joining them. I do not know the names of any of them. I was quite sure that these Persians would recognise me as an Arab of Kanguni and would not touch me. For that reason I stood still and watched the tamasha. They fell upon one another with sticks. I saw no one killed or wounded. No one was hurt. The row was stopped in about half-an-hour bv one Mahomed bin Saleh, a servant of Sheikh Hamad. He and Mansur bin Khairullah came in and separated them and they all dispersed and no one unskilled, wounded, or hurt. I then went back to my shop and stayed there till half-an-hour before sunset and then closed and went home. I know nothing more. I went to Sheikh Ahmed’s with the other people last Friday (December 2 nd) and gave evidence. They apparently put down what I said. I have not been anywhere this morning except to the bazaar. On arrival there I was told to come to you. No cross-examination. No. 21. Mutlaq bin Mubarak, negro, aged 50, states on solemn affirmation:— I am a khalassi on general service and get work wherever I can. I hare been about 30 years in and about Bahrein. I was ordered to come here yesterday. I came and was here till 9 o’clock Arabic, when I felt ill and went home. I did not ask anybody’s leave. This morning a servant of the Sheikh’s came and told me to come here and I came. . ^ / iav e been here all the month and remember the disturbance at the beginning of the month. On that day I said my asr prayers in the Mosque o Jumaan. After prayers I went to the “Sook-el-Maghasis,” the pawnshop azaar. I went and sat in the shop of Ishaq el Yahudi. I stayed there an our. All was quiet there, I did not see any row, but while sitting there I saw some Persians, about 5, 6 , or 7, pass by. They passed by in the ornnary way. They were not shouting or talking. They went on to the azaar. 1 do not know any of them, but one of them carried a revolver, and s ou d know him if I saw him. Although they went by quietly, I particu- ar y noticed the revolver. I followed them about 20 yards into the halwa azaar. Ihere they began to beat Arabs. The bazaar was filled with a great num er of people, Arabs. I did not see them kill any Arabs. I saw two men s ruck, one on the head, and one on the shoulder, but I did not see them s ^ 00( ~ t ilere quarter of an hour. I was not afraid of being drawn mto the quarrel. Thanks to God’s chance, I was not hit myself.% 23 The row stopped of itself and the people left the bazaar. I went home and saw no more of anything unusual. I was sent for to Mullah Sheikh Ahmed’s last Friday with the others. No cross-examination. Enclosure No 8 . able to throw light No. 11 . Mahomed Sarhan, Arab, states on solemn affirmation :—I am in service of Sheikh xAli bin Ahmed. I have been in his service live years. On the day that the disturbance took place I had been out hawking. On my return I saw a crowd of Arabs near the entrance of the bazaar. There were Arabs, Persians, and women and were hurrying backwards and forwards. I asked what was up. They said there was a quarrel between Persians and Arabs, and that Abdu Nabi had told his servants to be at the Arabs. I took my bird to my house, Ali Kazim’s house is contiguous to mine. 1 sat down to wash myself. Meanwhile a woman from Ali bin Kazim’s house told him that men had rushed into their house. I went out and found a crowd at Ali bin Kazim’s door, Arabs, Bahreinis, Persians, and women. I asked them what they were doing and told them to go away. The place was full of people. Some went away, some remained. Hereupon the women told me Abdu Nabi was inside and told me to come in. I went in and found Abdu Nabi. He was alone, standing near the door. I asked him how he was and he said, “ As you see me.” I don’t know what he meant. I left and returned to my house. I don’t know why the women called me, but perhaps they did so on account of the mob at the house. I then returned to my house and said my prayers. Afterwards I made inquiries from people as to what had happened, and I was told that Persians and Arab youths had been fighting in the bazaar. When I saw Abdu Nabi, he was in his usual health and condition. He was not bleeding or perturbed. There were no other men in the bouse. I do not know why the women screamed and called to me for help. I now say that the mob outside were all Persians. No cross-examination. Note —Notwithstanding Sheikh Hamad’s refusal to call any one actually implicated, I persuaded Vcazier Shereideh to bring this man on the grounds that he h id apparently partially assisted Abdu Nabi (No. 2 ), mtehis statement. He evidently came, however, duly tutored and prepared to lie, and kept chang ing his statements constantly. His evidence cannot be depended on in the slightest. Ali bin Mahomed, Persian of Dayir, states on solemn affirmation : T am a labourer under the mason Mahmud working at the Agency hospital. I remember the occurrence at the beginning of the month, but did not hear of it till afterwards. I have never been a servant of Abdu Nabi, but about three months a^o I was employed by him to accompany him when he walked abroad and to carry a revolver. This was done for 10 or 12 days. The reason was that Abdu Nabi had run down some robbers, Arabs of Bussorah ; 3 of them are still in prison, 5 others were expelled after a month. He, Abdu Nabi, went m fear of his life and asked me to stand by him day and night for a few days. Abdu Nabi supplied the revolver and took it back after the 10 days were No. 22 . over.24 —“ ' I know nothing about the disturbance except what I heard afterwards by' hearsay. No. 32. Mirza Ismail, Agent of Messrs. - Gray Paul &amp; Co., states on solemn affirmationMy ancestors have all been settled in Rangoon for many genera tions, but I was actually born in Bushire. I have been 13 years Agent for the British Indian Company (Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co.) in Bushire and 17 years here^ in their office. [Jr I remember the disturbance early in Ramzan. One of the Arabs was sent to give evidence before you by the Sheikh Hassan bin Ahmed Ibrahim, and I believe stated that he saw the fracas was actually with me on my premises the whole time that the disturbance was going on and could have seen nothing. He is a small merchant dealing mats, rafters, coir rope, etc. He came to my quarters about 11 o’clock Arabic to see me on business. He comes nearly every day. On this particular day he came to ask quotations for London freight for mother-o’-pearl shells. I was sitting outside my office. My office, as you are aware, is on the sea-shore, nowhere near the bazaar. He stayed and talked with me for a long time. About 10 or 15 minutes before sunset Mr. Milborrow (my chief) came downstairs and asked me to come for a walk and I left Hassan bin Ahmed there with several others who were waiting to see the sun go down in order to set their watches and then go to pray. I did not see him again then. Afterwards I met him, after having heard that he had given evidence of an eye witness before you, and said to him “ You who profess to read the Koran, how could you go and pretend to give evidence about the disturbance when you know you were with meat the time or at my place right up to sunset. ,, He replied, ‘‘I went there after I left yon.” I rejoined, “But by that time it was sunset and all the shops wbuid have been closed.” He then changed his statement and said, “ No, I went before I came to you.” This was obviously false as the disturbance was not known to any of us when he was with me. I did not hear of it until I went out. My tindal, Ghulam Ali, one of the clerks Abu Talib, could corroborate my statement Before me, (Sd.) P. Z. COX. Tka 9th December 1904.

With reference to the written agreement which was given you by Sheikh Esa bin Ali, Chief of Bahrein, on the subject of the expulsion of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed for three weeks from Bahrein, I have the honour to report that Sheikh Ali left for A1 Katr on the morning of Saturday, the 17th instant, i.e., within the period stipulated for by you. 2. The last act of this Sheikh was one of open bravado, as he sent his servants out to the down-going mail steamer Kangra and took away by force the three large baggalas which had been supplied by Haji Abdul Nabi for the reception of the Kangras cargo, his servants, I am informed, actually cutting all the ropes which connected the buggalas with the ship. 3. The people here speak of this act as one of Sukhra. It has caused considerable loss and inconvenience to the British India Steam Navigation Company, as the Commander of the Kangra had hoped to discharge all the Bahrein cargo which he had been compelled to overcarry on the up-journey owing to rough weather. He arrived here a day late and the Bazaar Master took some six hours in providing other boats. The result was that the Kangra left here on Saturday morning with some 73 packages of cargo overcarried, some of which included all the wood work required for the Charitable Dispensary and with a very fair possibility of missing counection with the fast mail-steamer at Maskat. 3459 V.D. 1*4.-W.

Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward copy of a letter No. 246, dated the 30th November 1902, from the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein to my address, on the subject of the acquisition of house property at Bahrein by foreigners. It will he seen that Mr. Gaskin considers it probable that Mr. Wonckaus, the German trader now at Bahrein, may wish to purchase the house which he has now taken on a five years’ lease from its Bahreini owner; and he also brings to notice the fact that the firm of Messrs. Hotz &amp; Co. of Bushire, now under Russian protection, probably intend to open a business at Bahrein in the near future. 2 . In the confidential letter No. 1685 E.-A., dated 1st October 1901, from the Under-Secretary to the Government of India to my address dealing with the subject of the acquisition by the Arabian Mission of property at Bahrein, it was laid down that in any similar case which may occur in the future, I was to he guided by the principle, that in cases where no suspicion exists of the transfer of sovereignty or administrative rights, it is neither necessary nor desirable to invoke publicly the Agreement of 1892 whereby the Chief of Bahrein is precluded from ceding, selling, mortgaging or otherwise giving for occupation, any part of his territory save to the British Government. No reasonable objection can, I presume, he taken by us to Germans or other foreigners hiring premises at Bahrein for the purposes of legitimate business; but we cannot view with equanimity the establishment of direct dealings between foreign Consular officers and the Chief of Bahrein. I am of opinion, therefore, that the opportunity may he taken of informing the Chief that, although the Government of India might have no objection to a private trader of a foreign nation acquiring premises in Bahrein for purposes of legitimate trade, such acquisition will not give the Consul of that foreigner’s nation the right to enter into direct relations with the Chief; and that should a foreign Consul seek to correspond directly with the Chief, we expect the Chief to decline to enter into such correspondence and to refer the Foreign Consul to the British authorities. As regards the firm of Messrs. Hotz &amp; Co., this firm may be under Russian protection in Persia, but this fact cannot give them the right to enjoy Russian protection in Bahrein which is outside Persia. No. 216, dated Bahrein, the 30th November 1902 (Confidential). From—J. C. Gaskin, Esq., Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, To Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to report that, in July last, Mr. Wonckaus leased a buildino 1 from Haji Hussein Kassab for a term of five years at a rent of Rs. 100°per annum, paying the rent of four years in advance, and that for the fifth year was retained for adding a kitchen and servants’ quarters and keeping the premises in repairs. Mr. Wonckaus has informed me that he has a clause in the contract to the effect that, in the event of the landlord desiring to dispose of the house at the termination of the lease, he has the option of purchasing it at the rate offered, should the landlord be agreeable to sell it for that figure. The house in question contains numerous godowns and an upper storey, and occupies the best site in Bahrein for trade purposes, especially the shell trade, and it is said to have cost over Rs.^ 22,000; and if Mr. Wonckaus’s business transactions prove successful, there is reason to believe that he will try to acquire the property. I understood from him that, in the event of his buying property in Bahrein, such property would come under the extra-territorial2 rights usually exercised by his Governmeut in the dominions of Muhammadan rulers. I told Mr. Wonckaus that the Chief of Bahrein lias a treaty with the British Government to the effect that he is not to sell ]and to foreigu^J with out the consent of the British Government, and when permission is g^n, it is understood that such lands or property shall remain under the local law. He referred to the fact of Persian and Turkish subjects acquiring land without reference being made to the British Government regarding which I inform him that such persons being amenable to Muhammadan law in their own country are bound to come under the same law in Bahrein by which immov able property is governed. Mr. Wonckaus, I believe, is on his way to Bushire, and, possibly, he may discuss the question with the German Consul at that place, and the latter may speak to you on the subject. Mr. S. Dods, an Assistant in Messrs. Hotz &amp; Co., Bushire, who enjoy Russian protection, informed me on the occasion of his recent visit to Bahrein that his firm will probably start business here in the first quarter of the new year when there will be two foreign firms established here. The Government of India, as you are aware, have already directed that our good offices shall be extended to European traders and their employes, but this appears to be insufficient to prevent foreign Consuls from interfering on behalf of the subjects of their respective Governments, and in view of the desire of the Russian Government to obtain a footing in the Persian Gulf and their policy of harming our prestige wherever they can, it is possible that that Government may make the presence of this firm an excuse for interference in Bahrein, and it seems to me desirable that, in order to check any friction likely to arise in future, some definite policy ought to be adopted as regards the question of the relations of the subjects of European powers with the Chief of Bahrein.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000365.0x0003a6_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/81</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000365.0x0003a6</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/81</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 1508/1905 Pt 1 'Bahrain: situation; disurbances (1904-1905); Sheikh Ali's surrender; Question of Administration Reforms (Customs etc)'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1904/1914</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-12-17T11:33:12</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (260 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.The subject 1508 (Bahrain) consists of three volumes, IOR/L/PS/10/81-83.
