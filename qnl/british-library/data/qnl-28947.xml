Sir, Regulations governing Importation of Live-stock and Animal Products into Foreign Countries HIS Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have had under ’ e '7 “' g al ' rangements for supply of information on the regulations governing the importation of live-stock and raw animal pi odnets into foreign countries. ‘2. In this connexion, I invite your attention to Lord Curzon’s circular despatch No. 208006/W/50 of the 26th July, 1920, conveying instructions to forward copies of the existing regulations governing the importation of live-stock into the country where you reside, as well as of any subsequent alterations or amendments thereto. 3. As regards a number of countries, however, no fresh information lias been received since 1920, or for some years, and, while it is recognised that there may have been no changes in the regulations, it appears desirable that the information at present available should be brought up to date. Moreover, the original request contained in the above- mentioned despatch was limited to the regulations dealing with the importation of live-stock. During recent years, however, similar regulations have been made by a number of foreign countries with a view to preventing the introduction of animal diseases by means of animal products (c.g., hides, bones, horns and hooves, &amp;c., meat and meat products, sausage casings) and other materials such as hay and straw packing, and His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, His Majesty’s Represenl^live^SI'tlVW at ^ ^A) 1 SECRO uoT, - —— -1 securing the infoimation ni q „ .. is intended to cover desirable to point out that ; i&lt; &lt;1111 | r „ er f arm stock, all kinds of live animals, and buds, and not onh tl e • ^ seeing that enquiries are constantly being received by the bo ^ in Great Britain and Northern Ireland in respect ot ^ and other pets accompanying travellers, and also in respect live-stock such as poultry, pigeons and rabbits. 5 .
