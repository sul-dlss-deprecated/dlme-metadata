The translation of a letter (folio 112) from His Highness Fayṣal ibn Turki, Chief of the Wahhābīs, to Kemball, dated 27 September 1854, in which Fayṣal ibn Turki insists that Humud bin Mujdel is innocent of the charges against him, which are ‘calumnies on the part of his enemies’;2. Letter 12B of 1854 (folios 113-14) from Kemball to Commodore George Robinson, Commanding Officer Persian Gulf Squadron, dated 17 October 1854. In light of Fayṣal ibn Turki’s refusal to cooperate with Kemball in bringing Humud bin Mujdel to justice, Kemball authorises Robinson to destroy one of Humud bin Mujdel’s boats that is currently on shore, provided the operation can be carried out from the sea. Kemball also writes that he does not presently have the resources to bring Humud bin Mujdel to justice at present;3. Letter 157 of 1854 (folios 115-16) from Robinson to Kemball, dated 18 October 1854. Robinson’s reply to Kemball’s previous letter states that it is not currently feasible to destroy Humud bin Mujdel’s boat, as it cannot be safely approached by any vessels at his disposal in the squadron. Robinson writes that he will attempt to seize and destroy any of Humud bin Mujdel’s boats that he encounters at sea;4. The translation of a letter (folios 117-18) from Kemball to Fayṣal ibn Turki, dated 18 October 1854, in which Kemball expresses his disappointment at Fayṣal ibn Turki’s position, making it clear that harbouring such a ‘disorderly character’ as Humud bin Mujdel distances the Wahhābī chief’s friendly relations with the British Government;5. List of the names of the prisoners taken from the people of Kuteef [Al-Qaṭīf] and killed by Humud bin Mujdel, and lists of property plundred by Humud bin Mujdel, with calcuations of the financial value of property plundered (folios 119-20).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x000014#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
