For the brief period of his rule, Akhenaten became the divine representative of the god Aten on earth.

The feminine forms of the king&rsquo;s depictions point to his androgynous divine status, rather than his actual appearance. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFragments of Amarna sculpture demonstrate the reaction to Akhenaten&rsquo;s radical reforms.
