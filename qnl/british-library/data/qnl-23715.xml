Subjects- Recovery of Government dues from pensions* I have the honour to state that the Government of India , Finance Department, decided in their letter No.D.2226-R.II, dated the 15th August 1932 (copy enclosed), that the recovery of dues from pensions is not pennissible and that no assignments or charges upon pensions or gratuities should he authorised. When considering the implications of the above order my predecessor decided that adjustments of Government dues against pensions which are decided upon before the pensions are sanctioned are in order, vide copy of Postmaster General, United Provinces' letter dated the 20th December 1932 and this office reply NoiMis.A-3970/?~183-III, dated the 18th February 1933 enclosed. Apparently this decision was based on an inference drawn from Section 12 of Act XXIII of 1871 that a recovery ordered by Government as opposed to one authorised by the prospective pensioner was not ultra vires. The Accountant General, Punjab, has, however, objected in general to the recovery of Government dues from pensions basing his opinion on Note 5 to Article 943, Civil Service Regulations (vide copy of his letter No, Pen.Gent .J .S./33-34/2205, dated the 9th December 1933 enclosed). In this c onnection, a reference is invited to Finance Department letter No.F 0 36(l3C )-Ex. 1/32, dated the 15th June 1932, to your address, which authorises advances of t ravelling allo vance to retrenched officers on the security of the payment of pensions against commuted values which seems to imply that recovery of Government dues otherwise than from the commuted value of pensions is inadmissible. The Director General of Posts and Telegraphs, has now invited my attention to the memorandum on the question of making rules for recovery of public claims from the pay and pen sions of civil officers furnished by the Finance Department to the Public Accounts Committee which has been embodied as Appendix X to Volume I of the Report of the Public Accounts Committee on the ecccvtfvUs oi 192{'-30 and has aelcod me to axau.u..e the. position ±c regard to recoveries of Government dues from pensions and to issue suitable instructions to the Branch Offices for the ir guidance e In view of the divergence of opinion referred to above I would request your authoritative decision in the matter.1936, ^rom'-th^Aulltcr lst ^ General, Posts and Teleg -aplis. thc Ac ccuntant t » Subject:- Recoveries from pensions.

The fact that the loss had been caused by the officers' negligence or fraud w ould in itself justify holding that the officers' service had not been wholly satisfactory. (b) when the pensioner by request made or consent given has agreed that the recovery may be made. If such request is not made or consent is not given by the pension even sums admittedly due to Government such as house rent, outstanding advances, etc. may not be recovered from pensionIn such cases however the executive autho rities concerned would have- to consider whether they the should not try to effect/recovery otherwise than from pension, for example, by going to a Court cf Law if necessary, II. In cases falling under (B) above, none *f the recoveries described in clauses (1) to ;3) may be effected by deduction from a pension already sanctioned except at the request or with the express consent of the pensioner* Under Article 351 of the Civil Service Regulations future good conduct is an implied condition of every grant cf a pension and apension c^n be withheld or withdrawn in whole or in part if the pensioner is convicted of serious crime or is guilty of grave mis conduct. This however refers only to crime or misconduct occuirLng after the pensioner has retired from service 9 and the rule would not therefore cover a reduction of pen sion made for the purpose of retrieving loss caused to Government as a result of negligence or fraud on the part of the pensioner occurring before he had retired from service. In cases where the pensioner doe s not agree to recovery being made even of sums admittedly due to4 3 Government, the concluding remarks made under iCt) above wi 11 also be app 11 cle » 4The above decisions of the Government of India make it specially important to enforce very strictly the rule that until it has been established that an officer has no outstandings due to Government his last pay or leave salary prior to retirement should not be paid. The enhanced importance of this should be impressed upon all audit, or treasury, or other disbursing officers, although it must be recognised that sometimes it may not be practicable to ascertain in time all the outstanding dues while sometimes the dues may exceed the amount of last pay or le^ve salary. Cases of loss tc Government such as are here indicated which c?mnot be made good by recovery from pension may be ncted in the Appropriation Report, if when they occur they seem to be significant, 5„ These instructions apply tc all Government servants under the rule-making control of the Secretary of State th e in Council, the Governor General in Council and ^ local Governments unless a rule tc the contrary is made (a) by the Governor General in Council cr a local Government in respect of £ ny Government servants under their rule making control not protected by Rule 9 of the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, or (b) by or with the approval of the Secretary of State in Council in respect of any other Gsvernment servants, f.

Subject;- Recoveries from pensions. • • • • w I have the honour to refer to your letter No. 117-A/103-34. dated the 1st July 1935 to the Accountant General) Posts and Telegraphs, on the subject noted above, a copy of which has been forwarded to my rffice with your endorsement No. 1-18-A/103-34, dated the 1st July 1935. 2, Notices of recoveries from pensions are often issued by the Income Tax Officers underSection 46(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1922. As these notices are issued under an Act of the Legisla ture it is obligatory on the officers disbursing 'salaries' which include pensions (vide Sec. 7(1) of the Income Tax Act) to carry out such orders. I have assumed that the orders of the Govern ment of India do not refer to such recoveries made under an Act of the Legislature. 3. In para.3(1) (a) of your letter referred to above it has been stated that punitive recovery may be made from pension under Article 47C(b) .C.S.R.- -to make good loss caused to Government as a result of negligence or fraud on the part Of the person concerned while he was in service. Article 47 0 C.S.R. has till now been interpreted as requiring the authority to sanction a reduced pension but the present order seems to authorise as well, lump sum recovery or a recovery of■ a specified sum in a stated number of instalments. It may kindly be stated if this interpretation of the present orders is correct.Co Py letter No• 230-^/103-34, deted the 30th November 1. t^rorr. the Auditor General in India, to the Accountant General, Bengal. • .

As regards the point raised in paragraph 3 of your letter, I am to state that the instructions in paragraph 3 I (a)-of the Auditor General's letter No. 117-A/103-34, dated the 1st July 1935, permit punitive recovery only 1 ndi re c tly by sanctioning a. reduc tion in the amount of pension under Article 470(b), Civil Service Regulations, either permanently or as a temporary measure (for a. limited period) according as the merits of each case may require. To sanction the full pension and to effect the punitive recovery dire cLly either in lump sum or by instalments would not, technical ly, be covered by the rule, although it will not have a different effect.
