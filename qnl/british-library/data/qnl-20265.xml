I presume you will 'be able to inform me of the Government of India's reply in time for me to reply to the Persian Consul next mail. As the Consul's object (as stated in his letter of 9th July to High Commissioner, Baghdad), is 'increment of revenue 1 ' (l mut. ) certificates of nationality are probably only valid for a limited period, is there not a danger,if he makes a good haul, of this visit becoming a precedent for frequent subsequent visits ? Might not it be interpreted as recognition afe that Kuwait is in his consular area, and lead to appeals to him by Persians in Kuwait, and possible intrigues by him in Kuwait affairs ? I believe that the Shaikh would view the visit with great suspicion, particularly if I were were to assist the Consular Agent in any way,a® he would think it was a design on his jurisdiction over foreign subjects. Possibly however, difficulty of refusing outweighs above objections. Political.Tele grain Prom Res i d en t, Eushi re To Foreign, Simla, To. 871.

In a conversation with Shaikh, February 27th, he told me con j . io.entially that his real reasons for refusing were that: firstly, if he agreed in the case of Persian subjects, Nejd, Muscat and all the other Liosleir States would want the same thing for their subjects. secondly, although it.might be only question of 'good offices' now, someone else might come here as Political Agent who wanted to have everything in his own hands, and it would develop into 'protection' (he cannot understand that different powers are conferred by different Orders in Council). Final result would be that he would lose all his power and prestige and eventually be reduced to the' status of Bahrain. After a long conversation he said that if Govern -ment really wished him to agree, he would have to agree. I replied that I was sure they did. He said that if 1 would say so in writing he would reply accordingly. We went on to discuss who would be recognized as Persians and I thought the whole matter finished. I wrote reply to his last letter, bringing in 'wish' as agreed, but to my ( ? surprise ) he replied yesterday evening again refusing. He gives the same reasons as in the previous letters. I went to see him this morning, Tuesday, and he has evidently been over-persuaded. ITow he says that nothing will induce him to give his official agreement voluntarily. At the same he says unofficially he has no objection to my giving good offices to Persians and that he will correspond with me freely about any cases relating to them which I care to raise, provided there is no official recognition of my (?) right to do so. I await instructions regarding further action. POLITICAL.nimp-RHTIAL. Ky .TC C 'S SAGL. C*' ^rom Political Resident, Bushire. 0 olitical Agent, Kuwait. No. 83-^., dated Bushire, 3rd Inarch 1925. Your telegram Ho. 77, dated the 2nd March 1926. Please reply to the Shaikh verbally. (1) _iL first objection. We are simply recomrrjending reciprocity. I feel fairly sure that the Sultan of Kejd will not ask for the same arrangement. He once protested against the Political Agent, Bahrain, punishing a Nejdi, for- -getting that he had previously given jurisdiction over his subjects in Bahrain to the Political Agent. As regards the fair treatment of Arab subjects of one State in the Persian Gulf by the authorities of another * State,/The Shaikh will remember how Sir P. Cox once intervened on behalf of the Shaikh of Uimn el Qaiwain when two other Chiefs imprisoned him. I am not in favour of extending the authority of officials of the Government of India over Arabs of the Persian Gulf. On the contrary I desire, even in Bahrain, to restrict our inteflvention in Arabs* affairs. (2) Secondly, when we have an official agreement relating to 'f reciprocal good offices, we nWietmcannot claim a stronger authority. Obviously the Ruler must see that his judges enjoy a good reputation with the public. Otherwise they will involve him in trouble from which no agreement or absence of agreement can save him. I am of opinion that His Majesty's Government will insist that some arrangement must be soutxx reached whereby the Shah can feel satisfied that the rights of his subjects are \ not overlooked in iftiwait. The * I do not anticipate that it will ever 'be necessary to per- -form written agreements at this late stage of our relations 1 with the Shaikhs.\wj ; | ,n he British Government gives good offices'to the subjects of small States, such as Austria, in Persia but does not eyercise jurisdiction over them. We only suggest a similar degree of good offices for Persians in Kuwait, but it is necessary that this arrangement be agreed to in writing. This is not to satisfy us, but to satisfy the Shah. FVKCHKT . Hot for cor/imunication with the foregoing . U) I f the Shaikh says that he would prefer to have a n ersian Consul, the repl^ is that it is most improbable that the ^ersian Government would accept one or more Kuwait Consuls in Bushire, Muhammerah and other Persian ports. Also this proposal certainly would not please His Majesty's Govern* -ment. The Sultan of Muscat keeps a semi -official Agent in Bandar Abbas. But the Persian Government does not recognize him as a Consul. He has no influence or power and often comes to the -British Consul to get the cases of Muscat subjects settled. (2) I am not aware how many Kuwait subjects there are now in Bahrain. If Shaikh Ahmad would prefer that Kuwaitis be should be treated like Bahrain subjects and not/dealt with in the Court of the olitical Agent, I am ready to suggest this modification of the existing practice to the Government of India.

I have used pretty strong language, and if he asks for an expurgated version to show to his advisers you can give him one. This one is for his own eye only. I am quite sure that iiis Majesty's Government won't accept a negative reply. I told Foreign fchat I was making one more effort before reporting officially. So please telegraph me after you have got Shaikh Ahmad's final reply. I think he will simply get an ultimatum if he remains obdurate, but Government won't thank us for forcing them into such a measure. We can't allow the precedent to be created by Kuwait of admitting foreign Gonsxils, and that is what Persia may like to introduce. If he says that he can't withdraw his letter, and that he prefers a peremptory reply, I wouldlike to be able to say to Government, on your authority, that he will bow to the inevitable. 0~C J. C. More, B.B.O., Political Agent, KuwaitMKMOHAIIDUM. I fl -orae months ago the Persian Govern- -raent raade a request to the British v;oV0.i,nment„ that as they had many subjects resiaing and trading in iluwait and also Persian vessels continually calling at that port the (consular) charge of ersian interests in Kuwait may be under- -taken by the British political repres- -entative. Twenty years ago it was estimated that there were 1,000 'ersians earning their livelihood in Kuwait. Now there may be 10,000. rhroughout the world it is common usage lor States to have retard for the interests oi their nationals residing in other countries. i where such interests are very great, ' highly appointed officials are jjosted / such as Ambassadors and Ministers. In places where the interests are moderate salaried consuls are maintained. -.vhere the interests are financially small, it is usual for the State interestea to invoke the kindness of another friendly State, having greater interests, so that the latter may undertake to watch the interests of the one less concerned. In this way, the British Government officials in Persia look after the inter- -est o of many States, Austria, Holland, II or way, 'wtugal^etc. In Muscat the BritishBri oitjh Consulate looks after American ^ and Portuguese interests. in India foreign consuls for certain countries have charge of the interests of many iiationais of other countries# ^or instance the French Consul at Bombay looks after Belgian interests. in short, a State cannot reiuse ^.o recognize such arrangements as these made between two foreign Govern- -ments —- that one Government which maintains a representative shall give assistance to the nationals of another Government which has no representative. Such arrangements are naturally only made when the two foreign powers are friendly with each other, and one is pleased to confer a favour on the other. Twenty-five years ago the relations between England and Bahrain were quite as the relations between England and Dibai. But the interests of Foreign States in Bahrain were also considerable. Then outrages were perpetrated first on German subjects and then on Persians. Both the German and the Persian Governments asked the British Government to protect and obtain redress for their nationals. his was forcibly done and the izzat of Shaikh Isa was lowered, because he would not listen to the British Govern* -ment. If a similar injustice against Persians occurred in Kuwait (which God forbid) would not a similar procedure be followed there ? Is+ ^ ^ V, 10- Is it not better that there'- shouid be a settled underBtariding between iluwait, iersia and Great Britain in biiues of friendship, so that even if a misfortune should ariee all officials liiajiiiBXRKat would understand their duties? You are aware tliat the British Government only requires justice for its Nationals and proteges . It does not Make unreasonable or preposterous demands. lie re is no wish that the subjects of Persia should be withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the Shaikh's Courts. In -ersia the Austrians are not entitled to the privileges of the Capitulations. But British Consuls watch their cases in the Adlieh Courts, and if injustice appears likely to be done, they make representations to the central Goverruaent. In the same way all that ie proposed for Persians in Kuwait is that their cases shall be watched by the Political Agency in the State Courts, and if necessary a final reference will be made to you. Strictly speaking, I think it was only necessary tu ask you to note the arrangement made between Great Britain and Persia and to acquiesce formally in it. It was not anticipated ^hat you would make any objection to a proposal which removes the possibility of certain political complications for GreatBritain and which is inexpensive to i 'ersia. The benefits which Kuwait subjects will derive from a reciprocal arcangement are obvious. I trust that you will now be satisfied and that you will cancel your letter of the 18th inarch and substitute a more acceptable one for it.Froirio P.i^Iuwait. To.

The Persian Govt demand is difficult for me to accept, and I hare sufficient confidence in the kindness 01 tne British vGort to think that I will not be forced to accept such a demand without a real reason. I consider Persians who hare made their homes here as Kuwait people. Of course a Govt has to look after the interests of its subjects, and if it finds that injustice has been done it has right to make a demand like this, but I hope this will nerer happen as I try to do justice to all alike. If the Persians think that anything has been done against the rights of their subjects, they can enquire into any such case through anyone they like. It is my earnest hope that you will agree to this. I am a true friend. As you know I agreed to the wishes of H.M.Gort and delegated thx jurisdiction orer subjects of A Moslem Foreign Powers tc the Political Agent. I felt confident ^Siiifcduirt after agreeing to this I would be left to deal with the subjects of Moslem Powers myself, but this demandof Persia upsets my hope. I beg therefore that V 'f 'S the British Gort will help me and will persuade the Persian Gort in any way possible. Ends. Although one would not think so from this letter, he understands the difference between 'projection' and 'good officesand although he knows it is only a question j of the latter, I think he fears it will be a thin end of tki the wedge. 5. I think it is useless to try any more to persuade him and consider the only thing now is for H.M.Gort to gire definite order. I am confident he will bow t© the ineTitable: in fact I understand it is not so much our giring good offices to Persians that he objects to, as his being asked to agree thereto.

Regarding the Persian Government's request however this J ^ is extremely difficult for me, and i have sufficient confidence in the Kindness of the British Government to believe that i will not be forced to accept this demand without any reason to call for my dvjin 0 so. There are large numbers of Persians who have made their homes here, and 1 look on these as Kuwait people, ui course a Government has one ri 0 ht to look after its s^ujecuS* interests, and if x it sees that any wrong or injust ice has been done to its subjects, it has then the right to aa.ie a demand like this. However, this is a thing which, please God, will never happen, as my decisions and my methods of deal ing with all people are, i believe, known to you; i endeavour by the grace of God to 0 ive just decisions which are acceptable to all, if the Persians see anything done against Uile eights of their subjects, they can represent any such cases cJ 'nd have them inquired into through anyone they like. It is my I earnest hope that you will agree wit] ' f -h this and accept it, as, please God, i am a true and sincere friend of the British i' ■British Government both in word and deed, .a you know i complied ( the wianes ox the British Government in deie 0 auia 0 to the politioal A^ent my jurisdiction over the subjects of the British Government and of non-Lusiim Foreign lowers, i did not xiesitate to comply with the wishes of His liajesty's Government in that case, in the hope that i would please them. -i uer tnis agreement it, was coiifirmed and ^iven out thut cases relating to the subjects of I.!;aslim Powers would be dealt witn oy ue, that is to say^persians iic «&gt;cr.

If a similar trouble should occur at Kuwait, would not His Majesty*8 Government take the sane line ? Is it not better that here should be a settled unuerstanding between Kuwait, Persia and Great Britain in the time of amity, so that all officials should fully understand their duties ?

After consultation with the Foreign and Colonial Offices, coxoies of whose replies are enclosed with this letter, the Secretary of State concurs in the Government of India's view that, in regard to the protection of Persian subjects, the Political Agent may be instructed to deal with each case as it arises and that no further intimation need be made to the Sheikh. He also agrees that no formal arrangement need be made for the protection of Bahrein!s at Ko w e 11. With regard to subjects of Iraq, however, I am to invite attention to the views expressed by the Colonial Office in their letter- As it appears that an implicit obligation already lies on His Majesty's Government to afford protection to Iraq nationals at Koweit, the Secretary of State considers that the Political Agent should be instructed to act towards Iraqis as in the case of Persians ard afford them his protection whenever possible. The Secretary of State is inclined to think it unnecessary to make any communication on the subject to the Sheika, but he is content to leave the decision on this point to the c retary to the Government of India, -Oreign and Political Department.

As regards the third parrgraph of the confidential despatch L T o. 194 -11 of the'7th of June from the Government of India, of which a copy was enclosed in your letter under reply, I am to draw attention to Article V of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922, which provides that in countries where His Hajeety the King: of Iraq is not represented, the protection of Iraq nationals shall be entrusted to His Britannic Majesty. It appears to Mr. Amery, therefore, that no question of making a spontaneous offer to the Iraq Government of good offices arises. He considers that each case should be dealt with on its merits as it occurs and that in view of the terms of Article V of the Treaty, to which attention has been drawn above, the Political Agent in iloweit should, whenever possible, give his good offices to Iraqis within his area. 3« As the Treaty was made in 1922 the ^arl of Birkenhead may perhaps consider it unnecessary to make any communication to the Sheikh of Koweit on the subject. 4.

I am strongly opposed to proposal which I think would inevitably lead to similar requests from Bin oaud and Peisiarifs and agree that it would react on question of Persian Agent at Bahrein. 211925 Persians proposed to appoint Persian subject residing in Kuwait as honorary Agent to issue passports to fellow subjects in Kuwait. They were informed that appointment of Persian representative even in honorary capacity would he contrary to Kuwait agreement of 1899 and that any derogation in favour of Persia would create emharras sing precedent in event of other Powers desiring to appoint representatives (vide Teheran's despatch 110 3rd July 1925 to you). Ultimately it was decided despite Shaikh's opposition that Political Agent should give good offices to Persians, and it has he en held that Iraq, nation- -als are also entitled to his protection ( vide your letter No. 194-N of 3rd September 1926 to Bushire), The Shaikh would certainly object strongly to the proposed appointmenti his administration though run on primitive lines is satisfactory: Iraqis are Already entitled to good offices and I believe their number is inconsiderable but Political Agent is making further enquiries on this p 0 int. For the above reasons I suggest that similar reply should be given to Iraq, as was given to Persian Gov- -eminent in 1925.
