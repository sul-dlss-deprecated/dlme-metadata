A 0* 3838/46 of 15th October# explaining the position regarding die issue of export licences at Bahrein and Koweit. Our desire for export licensing facilities in these areas was to meet any emergency which mi^ht arise involving curtailment of oil supplies from Abadan at elsewhere, when we would wish to bring all Bahrein and Koweit oil into the Sterling pool# whatever contracts were in operation. There is# however# the possibility of the sterling oil pool being discontinued# in which event expert licensing machinery in these areas would be unnecessary. Until such time# therefore# as the overall British oil position for 1947 has been more clearly established we shall not be in &amp; position to take a decision on the matter of export licensing. We will keep you fully advised of developments. Yours sincerely# (Bgd.)

The political Resident in the Persian Gulf has new drawn our attention to the fact that the issue of export licences by the Political Agent at Bahrein is regularized by a regulation made under the wartime emergency powers. If the issue of licences at Koweit is to be given legal cover, it will be necessary to consider under what powers the necessary regulations can be issued. Our Legal Adviser is doubtful Aether such powers do in fact exist. Before pursuing this legal point we should be glad to know whether, in view of this snag which we have now encountered, you would wish to preas your request for the issue of export licences at Koweit. We should ourselves have thought that the refusal of licences to export Koweit oil whenever they wish would be likely to meet with very strong opposition from the American participant in the Koweit Gil Co., and should be reluctant to bring the matter to a test. As regaras Bahrein it now appears doubtful whether the political wsident still has legal cover for the issue of export licences, but we are examining the legal position further. We feel, however, that if there is to be no licensing system at Koweit we can hardly insist on the continued issue of licences at Bahrein, and we think, therefore, that the matter must be dealt with as a whole. Yours sincerely, S.J.Gall, Esq*, Ministry of Fuel &amp; Power, Petroleum Division, 7 Millbank,S.W.l. Ggd.
