Sd. J.G. Acheson, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India,I 3 40157/27 21st September, 1927 Sir, I am directed to refer to India Office letter is understood to have been forwarded to the Forei/pn Office, and to previous correspondence re^ardinp; the undertakin :s given, in November, 191^, on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, to the Shaikhs of lohammerah and Kuwait in regard to the immunity from taxation of the date gardens owned by them on what was formerly the Turkish side of information of Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain, a copy of a despatch, with enclosures, on the subject which has been received from the Acting High Commissioner for Iraq. terms of the Financial Agreement arising out of Article 15 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of the 10th of October, 1922, were being considered by His Majesty's Government, it was originally proposed that a provision should be included in that Agreement making it obligatory upon the Iraq Government to continue in perpetuity the exemption from taxation of the date gardens owned by those two Shaikhs which His Majesty’s Government had undertaken to accord. This proposal was subsequently abandoned, however, and the High Commissioner for Iraq was instructed in November, 1923, to treat these obligations separately under Article 10 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty, but when final instructions were sent to the High Commissioner some four months later on the subject of the notes to be exchanged with the Iraq Government for the purpose of defining their obligations under that Article of The Under Secretary of State, the/ Foreign Office. the Shatt-al-Arab, and to transmit herewith, for the 2. I am to explain that at the time when thethe Treaty, mention of the obligations of His Majesty's Government to the Shaikhs of Mohammerah and Kuwait was inadvertently omitted. The High Commissioner, for his part, overlooked the instructions on the subject which he had previously received and the exchange of notes under Article 10 of the Treaty was completed before the omission was brought to light. It was accordingly decided that the Iraq Government should be addressed in the terms of Hr.Davidson's letter of the 17th of April, 1924, a copy of which forms the third enclosure to nr.Bourdilion's despatch of the 19th of August last. 3 . As will be observed from that despatch, the Iraq Government have now reached the conclusion that, although the date gardens in Iraq which are owned by the Shaikhs of Mohammerah and Kuwait have hitherto enjoyed immunity from taxation, this immunity cannot properly he continued without the authority of a special law. The Iraq Government are of the opinion that, if special legislation on the subject were introduced, it would be rejected by the Iraq Parliament, and they are therefore unwilling to take the responsibility of introducing such legislation, and have requested that the matter should be referred to His Majesty's Government. 4. In view of the fact that Iraq was captured from the Turks at immense cost to the British Nation, that the territory so captured has been handed over to the new State of Iraq, and that the undertakings which were given by His Majesty's Government to the Shaikhs of Hchammerah and Kuwait were part, and a very small part indeed, of the price paid by His Majesty's Government for victory in Iraq, of which the Iraq State has reaped the full benefit, it would not seem unreasonable to expect the Iraq Government to tak ; over and to discharge honourably the small obligations which were incurred by His Majesty's Government// 0 Government in capturing Iraq from the Turks. The Secretary of State is prepared to instruct the High Comnissionor to make further representations to the Iraq Government in this sense and to do his utmost to induce that Government to introduce special legislation for the purpose of securing to the Shaikhs of Mbhanmerah and Kuwait in perpetuity the immunity from taxation which was promised to them. He feels considerable doubt, however, whether the High Commissioner would be successful in inducing the Iraq Government to agree to introduce such legislation, or whether, even if the Iraq Government would agree to its introduction, it would be passed by the Iraq Parliament. 5. The Secretary of State is not aware of any ground upon which His Majesty's Government could justify the discon tinuance of the immunity from taxation hitherto accorded to the two Shaikhs. He would, however, be glad to be furnished with any observations on the subject which Sir Austen Chamberlain may have to make. In this connection, I am to observe that the question of the discontinuance of the immunity from taxation enjoyed by the Shaikhs of Kuwait appears, from the last paragraph of the India Office letter referred to above, to have been under consideration in 192C. 6. The Secretary of State would also he glad to be informed whether, in Sir Austen Chamberlain's opinion, the Shaikh of Mohammerah or his sons do, in fact, derive any benefit from the immunity from taxation accorded to their date gardens in Iraq in view of the fact that the control of the Shaikh's property is understood to have passed into the hands of the Persian Government. 7. A copy of a letter on the subject which the secretary of State has caused to be addressed to the India Office is enclosed herewith for Sir Austen Chamberlain’s information. I am, &amp;c., (Sgd) J.K.3IIUCKBURGH.Copy Secret 'D” The Residency, Baghdad, dated 19th August, 1927. I have the honour to address you on the subject of \ the undertakings given by Bio Majesty’s Government to the Shaikhs of Mo hammer ah and Kuwait in 1914 to the effect that their date gardens situated in this country should be immune from taxation. 2. As you are aware, in the course of correspondence ending with your predecessor’s telegram No.169 dated the 11th of April, 1924, it was decided that His Majesty’s Government should not include their obligations to the Shaikhs of Mohamnerah and Kuwait among the agreements covered by Article 10 of the Anglo-’Iraq Treaty, but that the matter should be reserved for subsequent settlement between the two Governments. This decision was officially conveyed to the ’Iraq Government at the time. 3. I have now to report that although the ’Iraq Government have continued during the past three years to exempt from taxation the date gardens owned by these Shaikhs in ’Iraq, the matter has never been settled between the two Governments. The Minister of Finance has recently raised the question and the Cabinet have now passed a resolution to the effect that they are not prepared to continue to accord exemption from taxation to these date gardens and that the matter should be referred to His Britannic Majesty’s Government.

I enclose for your information translations .11.1914 of the original letters addressed to the Shaikhs of Mohamrierah and Kuwait and copies of the following documents embodying the correspondence that has passed on the subject since the receipt of the telegram referred to in paragraph 2 of this des|&gt;atch:- (i) Idr.Davidson’s letter ho.P*G.?5 dated the 17th of April, 1924, to the Prime Minister conveying the decision of His Majesty’s poyemment* (ii) Letter No.946 dalad'tbe 30th of April, 1924, from the Secretary to the Council of Ministers referring Mr ♦Davidson’s letter to the Ministry of Finance for comment. ^, I ^ (iii) Letter No4232 dated the 5th June, 1924, from the Ministry of Finance replying to the above and suggesting that a reply to Mr.Davidson's letter should be deferred pending consideration of a proposal whereby the Shaikhs of Mohammerah and Kuwait should be required to render certain assistance to the ’Iraq Customs Department in return for the exemption of their 'Iraq date gardens from taxation. The question was submitted to the Coimcil several times between June and September, 1924, and on each occasion the Council resolved to postpone consideration. Finally the matter was dropped altogether for over two years. (iv) Memorandum No.8498 dated the 23rd of December, 1926, from the Ministry of Finance to the Secretary to the High Commissioner wherein the Minister raised the question again stating that the exemption hitherto accorded to the Shaikhs ’Iraq properties was illegal and could not be continued*(v) Letter No*P*b.3 dated the 6th of January, 1927, from Sir Henry Dobbs to the Prime Minister referring to the memorandum from the Ministry of Finance and su^sting that the Minister’s views on the legal aspect of the February, 1927, from the Minister of Justice commenting on the vie?/s expressed by Sir Henry Dobbs in his letter to the Prime Minister and suggesting that no legal right existed for the exemption of the date gardens in question from taxation, but doubting whether in continuing to accord them exemption the Government could be accused of an unconstitv‘' ^ 3t # (vii) Letter No.1268 3 19th of July, 1927, from the Ministry of Finance to the Prime Minister suggesting that the exemption of the gardens from taxation should be regularised by the introduction of special legislation. (viii) Letter Ho..3103 dated the 10th of August, 1927, from the Secretary to the Council of Ministers to the Secretary to the High Commissioner recording the resolution of the Council to the effect that the exemption of the gardens from taxation could not be continued without special legislation, but that the Council were not prepared to introduce the necessary legislation, which v/ould probably be rejected by the Chamber of Deputies, and requesting that the whole question should be referred to His Britannic Majesty’s Government. 5* I consider that the Council are fully justified in their assumption that the introduction of a law exempting the ’Iraq date gardens of the Shaikhs question might be mistaken. &gt; (vi) Letter lo*A.G/l/ECfsAo 1 dated the 22nd of of/1 of Mohammerah and Kuwait from taxation in porpetuo, imrolving an annual loos to the treasury of approximately one lakh of rupees, would meet with violent opposition from the Chamber of Deputies. The T Ira? politicians, so far from regarding this concession to the two Shaikhs as a debt of honour which the ’Iraq Government have rightly inherited from His hajesty’s Government, consider that His Majesty’s Government are attempting to foist on to the ’Iraq Government an obligation which His Majesty’s Government incurred and ought to discharge. In the case of the Shaikh of Mohammerah I fear that the ’Iraq deputies would represent His Majesty’s Government as having failed to fulfil the major part of their undertakings while they insist on the fulfilment of only that undertaking (contained in the final sentence of Sir Percy Cox’s letter to the Shaikh), which they consider can be laid at the doors of the ’Iraq Government «• 6* In this connection I enclose for your information some translated extracts from an obviously inspired article on the subject which appeared in A1 ’Iraq on 17th August. 7. The position is therefore that, in the opinion of the ’Iraq Government, the continued exemption from taxation of the date gardens in ’Iraq of the Shaikhs of Mohammerah and Kuwait requires special legislation; the ’Iraq Government are unwilling to introduce such legislation and would prohaHy be unable in any case to ensure its acceptance by the Chamber of Deputies; as the ’Iraq Government are under no treaty obli/^ation to fulfil the undertakings given to the Shaikhs by His Majesty’s Government, His Majesty’s Government has no means/I to l /V moans of inducing the 'Iraq Government to fulfil them beyond appealing to them to accept the obligation as a debt of-honour; this appeal has boon made and has failed. I can only suggest therefore that the matter should be reconsidered in connection with the forthcoming negotiations for the revision of the Anglo-'Iraq treaty and agreements.

You should endeavour, afterwards, in co-operation with Shaikh Sir Khazal Khan, Amir Abdul Aziz bin Baud and other reliable Shaikhs to liberate Basrah from Turkish possession* Should this prove to be beyonc your ability, you should make arrangements, if possible, to prevent Turkish reinforcements from reaching Basrah ox even Qurnah, until the arrival of the British troops whoiijr© shall sens, please God, ao soon as possible. I also hope that two of our men-of-war will reach Basrah before the arrival of your troeps there. And though it should be your highest aim, in this connection, to liberate Basrah and its people from Turkish rule, still we request tliat you should use your utmost endeavour in preventing troops and others from plundering the merchandise belonging to British merchants in Basrah and its dependencies, to protect the European residents of Basrah and to safeguard them from loss and oppression. In return for your valuable assistance in this important miter/1 / 1^ matter, I am ordered Tby the British Government to promise to Your Ezcellency that if we succeed therein - and we shall succeed therein, please God, -,w© will not return Basrah to the Turkish Government and we will not surrender it back to them at all. Furthermore I make to you, on behalf of the British Government, certain promises concerning Your Excellency personally, viz: (1) that your gardens which are now in your possessions viz# the date gardens situate between Fao and Qumah shall remain in your possession and in possession of your descendants without being subject to the payment of revenue or taxes. (2) that if you attack Safwan, Umm Qasr and Bubiyan and occupy them, the British Government will protect you from any consequences arising from that action. (3) that the British Government does recognise and admit that the Shaikhdom of Kuwait is an independent Government under British protection. I request that you will be good enough to read the enclosed letter and transmit the same to the Amir of Najd at the earliest convenience. I have addressed a letter to the Shaikh of llohanrorah similar to this I am writing you.

In that letter His Excellency has not thought it necessary to allude to a minor obligation in respect of 'Iraq which the British Government contracted at the very commencement of the campaign for the liberation of 'Iraq in 1914. I refer to the promise made to the Shaikhs of Ho hammer ah and Kuwait, in return for their important assistance to the Allied Forces, that the date gardens at that time owned by them between Basrah and Fao should be always exempt from land revenue. His Excellency feels sure that the 'Iraq Government will recognise this obligation as a debt of honour to those who helped in the campaign of liberation in its early and most doubtful stages. In view of the difficulties of settling a matter of this kind at the present juncture, His Britannic Majesty's Government have decided not to include these obligations to the Shaikhs concerned among the Agreements covered by Article X of the Treaty, unless the 'Iraq Government desires to do so; and the matter may be reserved/V Secretariat of the Council of Ministers, Baghdad, 29/30th April, 1924.

Tills I^inistry does not believe that it is the duty of the ’Iraq Government to carry out the promise made by the Government of the Occupation to the Shaikhs of Eohantiterah and Kuwait for the permanent exemption of their date gardens from Government taxation. It is however suggested that opportunities might be seized to obtain from the said Shaikhs certain services of value* to ’Iraq, when we would be able to agree to this exemption in return for such services* We are of opinion that the best sendee they can render is that of assistance in combating the smuggling of contraband articles, and we have asked the Director General of Customs and Ebtcise to make definite suggestions in this connection. We therefore suggest that a reply to H.E. the High Commissioner’s letter might be put off pending receipt of the suggestions of the Director General of Customs and Excise. When these suggestions have been received a reply my then be rendered to H.S. the High Commissioner in the following sense:- If the said two Shaikhs agree to render the required assistance the ’Iraq Government will agree to their exemption from payment of taxation.

In these circumstances I regret that I am unable to prepare and submit to Parliament a law providing for these exemptions.

V % dear Prime Minister, I enclose a copy of a letter received from His Excellency the Minister of Finance on the s bject of the promise made to the Shaikhs of Mohamilierah and Kuf/ait that the date gardens o ned by them at the time of the outbreak of ’ ar ?/ith Turkey in 1914 should be always exempt from land revenue• f 4 Your Excellency ?/ill'remember that in Hr .Davidson's letter Ho.P.0.75 dated the 17th of April, 1924, to your address, it was stated that I felt sure that the 'Iraq Government would recognise this obligation as a debt of honour, but that the matter could be reserved for subsequent settlement between the two Governments. It thus appears that the question is one which should be properly discussed with Your Excellency, and nob primarily with the Ministry of Finance. I am ready to discuss it at any time convenient to Your Excellency. Before doing so, however, I wish to express a doubt as to whether His Excellency the Minister of Finance has correctly stated the bearing of the Organic Law upon the matter. From previous correspondence with the Ministry of Finance I have understood that they have held that under Article 90 of the Organic Law the 'Iraq Government is precluded from varying except by law the rates at which taxes were being collected from any particular lands at the time of the promulgation of the Organic Law. For instance, when I enquired recently the reason why the revenue demand on the Hor ibn Najim in Diwaniyah was only 25% of the produce, I was informed that the Government demand had been/y . been specially reduced to 25% on this land in the days of the British Occupation and that under the Organic Law it could not now be enhanced except by a special law* I have received similar replies from the Ministry of Finance in other instances. It appears to me therefore that, as the date gardens of the Shaikhs of Mohamnerah and Kuwait were exempt from the payment of revenue at the time of the promulgation of the Organic Law, they must in accordance with Article 90 of the Organic Law continue to enjoy such exemption until a revenue demand is specifically imposed on them by a new law and that the legal exemption required hy Article 93 of the Organic Law has been already conferred on them by Article 90* Your Excellency will perhaps wish to consult the legal advisers of the 'Iraq Government upon this point before continuing the discussion* I am causing a copy of this letter to be sent to the Ministry of Finance* I remain, etc*, (Sgd) H.DOBBB* is Excellency Ja'far Pasha al 1 Askari, C*M*G, President of the Council of Ministers, Baghdad.’Iraq Ministry of Justice, Baghdad, No •A.G/I/SC 3/101. Dated 22nd February, 1927, To The Secretary to icil Council of Hinisters, Baghdad, 9 With reference to your llo*121 dated the 8th January, 1927. The Government has hitherto abstained from collecting revenue in this case by reason of a promise made by the British Government in consideration of certain acts at that time not done, but presumably subsequently executed as agreed, I do not find that the promise gave rise to any right which by the Law of ’Iraq then in force could be termed a legal right to exemption. Before the Constitution, the Government, if it had decided to collect the revenue could have done so without the need for special legislation revoking the promise. That, I think is clear and as no special law has been passed dealing with this case it follows that after the Constitution the Government is entitled to collect the revenue without special legislation. If it is argued that the Constitution prevents Government from collecting the revenue without special legislation, then it must then he admitted that Article 90 of the Constitution operated so as to give legal force to acts which had no legal force before, and that f I consider, would be far from the intention of/of the article. Article 90 is, in i^ r opinion, no rnore than a general validation of existing legal enactments governing taxation* If it is asked why such validation is needed there, in view ofjthe articles regarding the validation of laws, then the answer is that it is not really necessary any more than Article 102 is necessary in view of Article 26(C) but the financial clauses were drafted so as to stand by themselves. I am of opinion that it would be better for this exemption to be supported by law but, at the same time, I am not convinced that the Government could be justly accused of an unconstitutional act if it continued to abstain from collecting the revenue. Certainly the Government could net be so accused in the case of a person exempted by the rules of International Law or by International agreement although there he no special law permitting such exemption, and the same considerations might, in try opinion, he applied to the exceptional nature of the present case.

The ’Iraq Government appreciate the necessity of keeping the promise made to the said two Shaikhs; but in the meantime they consider that the period from the date of exemption to date is a sufficient reward to the Shaikhs for the services they rendered at the beginning of war. Besides, the Government feel that the present political and economic conditions render them non-confident of the passage ox such bill through the Chamber of Deputies* Therefore, the Council of Ministers suggest that the British Government should be approached once more in regard to this question, of which the settlement should be postponed until a reply is received from the British Government.

Negotiations are in progress now in London between British Government authorities and leading ’Iraq statesmen, headed by His Majesty the King, in regard to certain outstand- ir^ question between the two allied states and to the removal of cerMn suspicions which are felt from time to time as a result of certain points of difference being still left without satisfactory solution* It is an established fact, over which no two persons can differ, that it is a matter of first class concern to both parties that there should disappear from the field anything that is calculated to leave the door open for the entry of the self-seekers to raise dislike and dissension between the two noble nations. This can only be achieved by a friendly settlement of outstanding questions, based on conviction and not on the dictation of terns by the stronger party* In the belief that this friendly spirit will permeate the atmosphere of the negotiations between BriMn and ’Iraq, we wish to discuss one of the questions which the ’Iraq continues to urge and which remains without solution* We think that we are doing well in inviting attention to the settlement of this question in which gross injustice has been done to ’Iraq and an evident encroachment was made upon her rights - so evident that we do not think the British Government will pass by un noticed* The question is that of the continued exemption of the estates of the two Shaikhs of Ku?/ait and Mo hammer ah from miri fees. About seven years have lapsed on the establishment of the National Government in ’Iraq without the said governmentgovernmeri receiving a single farthing on account of miri fees in respect of the extensive estates of these two Shaikhs, on the grounds that the British Government of Occupation had promised tho two Shaikhs to exampt their estates in B&amp;srdh from miri fees. These foes ai'e assessed annually at 12,000 Liras (Turkish gold). Accordingly the total loss to ’Iraq up to date, on account of this exemption amounts to some 100,000 Liras. In foregoing this considerable sun the already poor treasury of ’Iraq suffers an undoubted loss. In addition to such loss, there in to be taken into account the prejudicial effect on the independence of ’Iracr of the compulsory exemption from fees of certain estates, a thing which rising ’Iraq cannot in any way tolerate. f, fhen the budget estimates were submitted to the Chamber of Deputies at the last parliamentary session, H.E. the Minister of Finance (in reply to the violent criticism directed to him in connection with this exertion which is derogatory to ’Iraq’s scvreignty) stated that discussions on the subject were in progress between the ’Iraq Government and H.E. the High Commissioner. In the meantime the l inister of Finance referred to the assistance which the British Government claimed to have been rendered by the two Shaikhs to the British Expeditionary Force in ’Iraq during the Great War - assistance which the British Government thought at the time fit to reward by the exemption of the Shaikhs’ estates from miri fees. Assistance might have been rendered unheard of and unnoticed on our part because those who rendered it happened to be, say, in the wilds of Africa; but Kuwait and lohamnerah being so close to ’Iraq and at only a short distance from Basrah, we cannot possibly remain ignorant of any assistance rendered by these two dependencies to the British Expeditionary Force, as we were close to all and we witnessed all the military operations and political activities wldch took place in , esopotamia. On the other hand we hap, ento know of cor tain acts on th© port of the two ohaikhs which proved exceedingly harsnful to the movements of tsio ! ri Lish armies, so harmful that in 1916 the British Authorities were compelled to declare a land blockade on Kuwait exports. \fhat is the nature of the assistance rendered by the two Shaikhs? ¥e do not think that Great Britain will be able to disclose the nature of such assistance, since there has been nothing of the sort. On theothar hand, so far as T/6 are aware the two Shaikhs did not render tue least assistance to the British Expeditionary Force. On the contrary they offered resistance to that force. Shaikh Mubarak As-Sabah would not allow the military transport ships which carried the ’Iraq Expeditionary Force over from India on the outbreak of the war to lay anchor in Ms country. Neither would he allow the Kuwait to be used as a coaling station for the British fleet in the early days of the war. On the other and, is there any one in 1 Iraq who did not hear at the time of the enormous smu^ling of floods by Kuwait for the Turkish armies in •Iraq, Syria and the Hedj&amp;s - that illicit trade of # ich even the Kuwait Government authorities were suspected* Granted that, can forget all this, can we ever forget the deplorable attitude of the two Shaikhs towards the Arab rising undertaken by His Majesty Hussin ion , Ali against the TtUfeg for the liberation of the Aiaba irom their bondage, towards which rising they did not show the least sympathy and failed to recognise its lawfulness in addition to theii failure to lend it any support whether moral or material, and that in spite 5f the British efforts exerted in that direction? These ?t© some of the acts undertake ; by the Aowait dependency during the Great War. No doubt they were harmful to the Military Expedition in 'Iraq* We do not know of any assistance j rendered by Shaikh Mubarak As-Sabah or his successors. As remarda the Sha kh of Mohammerah, it is surprising to claim that he had rendered any assistance to the %itish forces, inasmuch itV:Oj) inasmuch as tc kno*'? that when the British G-overnment directed its military expedition against Basrah the Shaikh’s subjects were in a state of rising against him* and he was only able to maintain his position in l ohaarerah thanks to the protection afforded him by the considerable British forces which were dispatched to repulse the attacks or the bedouin Arabs on Naeiriy&amp;h and Amniyah. Hence it is surprising to saddle ’Iraq with demands of false gratitude to even the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Shaikh of Mohammercn, now a prisoner in i or si a, and to ask for a reward to them while they have not rendered the least as sis time e to ’Iraq but, on the contrary, their territories have bene fitted by thajexi sting state of ’ Iraq. In the meantime the dangers which had been threatening them by the existence of the ottoman Government in ’Iraq have been removed* Assuming that they had rendered any assistance to the British forces, it is up to the British Government to reward the two Shaikhs by some other mean® and not at the expense and in the neme of 5 Iraq, since they have not rendered the least service to this country which has undertaken to liberate itself from everything that savours of interference in its affairs. For the foregoing reasons we consider that the British Government* e persistence in preventing the ’Iraq Government from 1 evyin^•, oi miri fees on the estates of the two Shaikhs is illogical and contrary to the wishes of Great Britain which require the exteniion of assistance and support to ’Iraq* We hope that this injustice to ’Iraq will be removed in the course of the present negotiations. This should not prove difficult to accomplish. inP. 4537. India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.l. 18th October 1927. Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to your letter of the 21st September No.40157/27, relative to the immunity from taxation of the date gardens owned by the Shaikhs of Mohammerah and Kuwait in the present territory of Iraq. 2. The correspondence referred to in the India Office letter quoted by you dealt with the possibility of exerting pressure on the Shaikh of Kuwait by threatening to dis continue the remission of tax on his date gardens covered by the assurance given to him in 1 j 14. In 1920 the local authorities considered, and the Government of India agreed, that the assurance of remission was unconditional and the threat to withdraw it impracticable. 3. The Earl of Birkenhead, for his part, shares the view of the Secretary of State for the Colonies expressed in paragraph 5 of your letter that there appears to be no ground on which His Majesty^ Government could adequately justify the discontinuance of the immunity from taxation hitherto accorded to the two Shaikhs. He is however, ascertaining the present views of the Government of India on the point and also on the course which might be followed if it should prove finally impossible to persuade the Iraq Government to continue the exemption from taxation at present enjoyed by the Shaikhs. A copy of the letter which is being sent to the Government of India is enclosed. 4. In the meantime Lord Birkenhead desires to express his concurrence in the views and proposals contained in paragraph 4 of your letter and would be glad to see their acceptanceacceptance pressed by all possible means on the Iraq Government. 5. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Foreign Office. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant 3d. L.D. Wakely. The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office? u {**) Secret * fi.4422/4047/65.

It is, in Sir Austen Chamberlain’s opinion, not open to question that the undertaking given by His Majesty’s Government in 1914 to the Sheikh of Koweit was intended to apply in perpetuity, and that the exemption was a reward for assistance which the Sheikh actually gave to His Majesty’s Government and was not dependent on his future conduct* 3. From recent unofficial correspondence with Major- General Sir Percy Cox, the Secretary of State considers that it is equally clear that the undertaking given in 1914 to Sheikh Kazaal of Mohammereh regarding his date gardens on what was 'then Turkish territory was intended to be of perpetual application, and that the exemption was accorded inin return for services actually rendered, and was not dependent either upon the Sheikh’s future conduct or upon his future relations with the Persian Government. 4, The answer to the question contained in paragraph 6 of your letter, whether the Sheikh of Mohamerah or his sons do in fact still derive any benefit from the immunity from taxation accorded to these date gardens is in the affirmative I am, • Sir, Your obedient servant, 3d.

Article 3 of the revised Treaty reads w His Majesty the King of Iraq undertakes to secure the execution of all international obligations wnich His Britaanio : ajesty has undertaken to see carried out in respect of Iraq'*. As you will remember, the Iraqis asked for a detailed statement of our international obligations and the memorandum referred to above was communicated to them in response to this request. They have not up to date questioned the contents of that memorandumj and, it as it to be expected, Ja*far Pasha signs the draft Treaty without raising this point, we should be justified, I think, in assuming that they accept the Statement of our international obligations (including the reference to our commitraents to the Shaikhs) as authoritative. In that event, it seems to us that the immunity from taxation promised to the ohaikhs will become a Treaty obligation of the Iraq Government and it would be unnecessary to cover the ground again by means of a provision in the revised Financial Agreement.

As the New Treaty between this country and Iraq has now been signed, and as no objection to the terms of the memorandum was raised by the Iraqi delegates during the course of the recent negotiations His Majesty’s Government assume that the Iraq Govern ment are now prepared to recognise the undertakings which were given to the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and lu/wait as a part of the the arguments aduced in Colonial Office lettersU (^V) || September last, and also, if necessary, remind the Iraq Government that the Financial Mission, which visited Iraq in 1925, recommended, in para* VIII of the Appendix to their report, that the Iraq Government should honour the undertakings which had been given by His Majesty’s Government to the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Kuwait. The Iraq Government have not hitherto, so far as I am aware, given any express intima tion of their unwillingness to accent that recommendation. 4* If the Iraq Government are prepared to honour those undertakings, but are doubtful of their ability to persuade the Iraq Parliment to pe.ss the necessary legislation it will be for consideration whether King Feisal should not be requested to pass an Ordinance, in accordance with Article 26(3} of the Iraq Constitution, to give effect to these undertakings. For the reasons stated in the second paragraph of this Despatch His Majesty’s Government consider that the fulfilment of these undertakings may be regarded as a treaty obligation on the part of the Iraq Government which that Government may be called upon to fulfil under Article 4 of the Treaty of the 10th of October 1922, or under Article 3 of the Hew Treaty when that instrument enters into force; but it would clearly be preferable if the Iraq Government could be induced to honour those undertakings without the necessity of invoking the articles of the Treaties to which I have referred above. I have etc..British International Obligations in respect of Iraq. The principal international obligation of Great Britain in respect of Iraq is the duty imposed by Article 22 of the Covenant of the Leaque of nations, viz. that of rendering advice and assistance until such time as the country is able to stand alone. The 'Treaty of Alliance' between Great Britain and Iraq i.e. the Treaty of 1922 plus the Protocol of 1923, and the subsidiary Agreements of 1924, was accepted by the Council of the League of Nations in September 1924 as giving effect, together with certain complementary undertakings by the British Government to article 22 of the Covenant. If follows,therefore, that the whole of the terms of the Treaty of Alliance must, under existing conditions, be regarded as part of the interna tional obligations of Great Britain. Indeed, in the first of the complementary undertakings referred to, Great Britain explicity assumed responsibility, tov/ards all members of the League of Nations who might accept the treaty regime, for the LuPfllEient by Iraq of the provisions oi the Treaty of j„lliance so long as it remained in force. The complementary undertakings of September 19^6 includedj- (1) The conclusion of special extradition agreements on behalf of Iraq; (2) The submission of an annual administrative report to the Council of the League, and (3) The reference to the Hague Court ot disputes with other members of the League in regard to the fulfilment, interpretation or application of clauses in the Treaty of Alliance, with the implied undertaking that the decision of the Coart would be accented and executed. These three undertakings must also be regarded as part of the international obligations of Great Britain in respect of Iraq. Special reference should be made to Article 10 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922,.which provided for the conclusion of separateseparate agreements to secure the execution of any 'Treaties”, agreements or undertakings, which Great Britain is under an obligation to see carried out in respect of Iraq* Our obliga tions under this article were further defined in 1926 by an exchange of notes between the High Commissioner and the Prime Minister of Iraq. By a decision of December 1925 (dealing with the question of the Northern Frontier of Iraq) the Council of the League of Nations stipulated that the regime established by the Treaty of Alliance and complementary undertakings should be continued for a maximum period of 25 years. The requisite extension of the duration of the Treaty was provided for by the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of January 1926. In submitting this Treaty to the League, the British Government reaffirmed the undertakings given by them in 1924 and engaged to discharge them throughout the extended period contemplated in the new Treaty. The Treaty of 1926 is thus a further international obligation of Great Britain. In delivering their award on the Frontier question the Council of the League, besides stipulating for the conclu sion of a new Treaty between Great Britain and Iraq, invited the British Government. (1) to submit to the Council the measures to be taken in order to secure for tne Kurdish popula^ tion of Iraq certain guarantees in respect of local administration. and (2) to act as far as possible in accordance with certain other suggestions (principally in regard to the treatment of minorities) made in the report of the League Commission of Enquiry which had visited Iraq in 1925. His Mahesty’s Government have reason to understand that the League of Nations regard them as under an obligation in respect of these two points. The nature of our international obligations in any new treaty must necessarily depend upon the terms of the treaty itself. If the existing instruments defining our relations with Iraq are revised, the revised instruments will have to be submitted to the Council of the League for acceptance as giving effecteffect, under the altered conditions, to the provisions of everything that they contain, together with any complementary undertakings on the part of that may accompany them, will he safely assumed that the provisions of the Treaties, etc., are not all of equal importance in the eyes of the League. are mainly of domestic concern to Iraq. To the modification or con-continuance of such provisions, there is no reason to suppose that the League would raise objection. What the League will mainly he concerned in safeguarding are those provisions which:- (1) may he regarded as essential for ensuring the continu ed progress of Iraq in the direction contemplated by Article 22 of the Covenant; and (2) have a definitely international aspect, as affecting the rights of foreign nations or the general interests of civilisation. Apart from these obligations of a more general character there are certain specific assurances regarding the position of Italian nationals in Iraq given to the Italian Government under the correspondence with the Italian Amoassador in April 1924, copies of which were communicated to the Iraq Government in Mr. Bourdillon*s letter to the Iraq prime Minister oi the This Memorandum would not be complete without mention of a further and minor British obligation in respect of Iraq, with which the Iraq Government are already fully familiar, namely, that entered into with the Sheikhs of Mohanjmerah and their assistance in the earlier stages of the War, complete immunity from taxation in respect of their Date Gardens in the Basrah Vilayet. For the reasons explained in Mr .Davidson*s Article 22 of the Covenant. Once they are so accepted become an international obligation of Great Britain, the treaties of 1922 and 1926 being superseded The above sets out what may be described as the legal or technical aspect of the case.

It will be seen that Sir Gilbert Clayton enquires in paragraph 4 of the accompanying despatch whether the exemption accorded was intended to be personal to the Shaikhs or to attach to their property and thus pass with their property on sale or* transfer. In Lori Passfield 1 Q mind there appears little ground for doubt that the exemptions were not intended to attach to the property as such, but to be personal to the Shaikhs and to their successors. He will be glad to know whether this view is also held by Mr. Wedgwood Etenn. Z , Sir Gilbert Clayton raises two other main points in his despatch :~ (1) Whether the undertakings entered into with the Shaikhs could properly be regarded as an international obligation on the part of His Majesty Government for the purpose of their Treaty engage ments with Iraq; and (2) whether those obligations can properly be discharged by means of Ipmp sum payments by the Iraq Government to the Shaikhs* As regards the first point, the position is not altogether clear. By Article 10 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922, the High Contracting Parties undertook to ’'conclude separate agreements to secure the execution of any Treaties, agreemen tsAgreements or undertakings which His Britannic Majesty is under obligation y to see carried out in respect of Iraq#. It was subsequently decided to proceed by means of an exchange of notes instead of by separate agreements. By an oversight no mention oi^the undertakings to the Shaikhs was included in the notes exchanged, and as the note then addressed to the Iraq Prime Minister purported to set out in full ” the Treaties Agreements and undertakings” referred to In Article 10, it would, in Lord Passfield 1 s opinion, be difficult now to argue that this particular undertaking was covered by that Article. As Mr. Wedgwood Benn is aware, anty attempt was made during the negotiations of the Treaty of 19i;7 to overcome this difficulty by including mention of these undertakings in a note, setting out in full the international obligations entered into by this country in espect of Iraq, which was presented to da*far Pasha in the course of those negotiations. As, however, there is n immediate likelihood of the Treaty of 1927 entereing into force, thpfiote presented to da 1 far Pasha would appear to lose much of its value, particularly in view of the fact that, as Sir Gilbert Olay ton points out in his despatch, the Iraq Government have never* specifically admitted the accuracy of the statement of international obligations contained therein. 4. It would seem therefore unsafe to attempt to rely in this matter upon Article 10 of the Anglo~Iraq Treaty of 19^2. But it would appear open to His Majesty's Government as an alternative to fall back upon Article 4 of that Treaty. This Article provides that 'His Majesty the King of Iraq agrees to be guided by the advice of His Britannic Majesty, tendered through the High Commissioner, on all important matters affecting the international and financial obligations and interests of His Britannic Majesty for the whole period of this Treaty'. The undertakings to the S^jlikhs could, Lord Passfield considers, reasonably be described as an important matter affecting the internati nal and financial obligations of His Britannic Majesty and thus a matter upon which the Iraq Govern, ment are under Treaty obligation to be guided by the advice ofHis Majesty’s Government. Subject to the views of Mr .Wedgwood Benn, Lord Fassfield would propose to inform the High Commissioner accordingly, and to authorise him in the last report to inform the Iraq Government that His Majesty’s Government regard this as a matter upon which the Iraq Government must be guided by their adviQG* e 5, On the second point Lord Passf^ld is disposed to agree with Sir Gilbert Clayton that, if the Iraq Government can be induced to offer a lump sum in final settlement of the Shaikhs’ claims for exemption from taxation, this would provide an eminently satisfactory solution. He would, however, be glad to be favoured with the views of Mr. Wedgwood Benn on this suggestion. 6. A similar letter is being addressed to the Foreign Office. Copies of this correspondence are being sent to the Treasury. I am, Sir, Your most obedient servant, (Signed) p,G.H. Williams* The Under Secretary of State, India Office.SKCRST. B The Residency, Baghdad, dated 8th July,1929* H \( € x My Lord, (j v I have tlie h nour to refer to despatches of Your . / Lordship ? a predecessor Secret dated the 11th of June, 1929, and Secret A dated the 13th of March, 1929, on the subject of the exemption from taxation enjoyed by the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Moha miner ah. 2. The- situation, in so far as the Iraqi Government is concerned, remains as described in •.h*• Bourdillon 1 s despatch Secret D dated the 19th of August, 1927, and there is little doubt that, if the Council )f Ministers were to introduce a law exempting the two Shaikhs from taxation 'in perpetuo” and thus Involving the Treasury in an annual loss -T i-evenuc of app.-oxi ately li lakhs of rupees, there would be a strong opposition in Parliament and the bill would ;robabiy be thrown out. Another course would be to force a. reluctant King and Cabinet to pass an ordinance under Article d6ga) of the Organic Lav/. A n ordinance passed in accordance with the provisions of that Article would not have to be submitted to Parliament, provided it were passed for th purpose of securing the fulfilment of an obli gation arising out of a Treaty approve d by Parliamen f ; or by the Consti tuent Assembly , but in x any case it would be published and would become the object of criticism levelled against the Cabinet and possibly even against the King himself. 4. There is much tc be said for the Iraq^i point of view on this question. Quite apart from serious financial consi derations, the granting ol perpetual exemption presents many obvious disadvantages and might in certain circumstances lead to an awkward situation. For instance, is the exemption to be considered personal or would it pass with the property on sale or transfer ? I presume that it would be personal, but evenr’x 6' \\ B 4 i 1 in that case the benefits would in course of time be split up by inheritance among many collateral descendants, in the event of the Shaikhs ceasing to be rulers as is in practice already the case in regard to the Shaikh of Mohammerah, While it is true, therefore, that the obligatien entered into b,, His Majesty’s Government exists, I venture to think that it would not have been incurred in its present form if it had been possi ble at the time to envisage its implications. 5. Before initiating action on the lines of paragraph 3 of this despatch, I should be glad to know whether it is still certain that the obligation can be dealt with as an interna tional one which Icaq is bound under treaty td take over, now Xi that the proposed Treaty of lUkV is no longer being proceeded with (in this connection see paragraph f of hr. 0rmsby Gore’s Secret despatch dated the h6th of January 19h8;• it is possible that the Iraqi Government might content this point and request arbitration bj an impartial authority. It is true that obligation was defined as an internatienal ~ne in a note presented to Ja'far Pasha during the course of the negotiations which took place in 19£h , but the xruqi Government have never, t as far as X am aware, acknowledged Luc ob.iigatien, which was nefl included in the list presented to them in connection with the Treaty of tne 10th of October 1988. 6. It is also worthy of c ns Herat ion whether a w.ore satisfactory course of action might not b• to seek a way of extinguishing the Obligation once and for all on terms which would be fair to the dhaikhs. This mi-lit be done by means of a cash payment based to some extent up* n a certain number of years purchase of the annual payments involved. Bp to the present date, the sum of the annual exemptions granted amounts to Rk 11, 27,418-12-0 in the case cf the Ghfeikh of Kuwait and R 5 .4,90,835—0-0 in that of the Bhaith of Mohnmnerah making a total of R 3 * 16,17,650-12-0, or C. .1.1,323. Of -'his total the sum of Rs. 10, 12,120-10-0, or G. r? 5, 09, has been remitted since 19211921 inclusive by th^ T me Oovernnent, and te.6,95,527-2-0, £.45,414, by the Military Administration during the years 1914- 1920. The present annual value of the remiaai n is R 3 .1,09,590 to the Shaikh of Kuwait and 11.40,955 to the Shaikh of lohammerah. 7, A reasonable cash settlement might prove attractive to the Shaikhs and a better chance of a satisfactory settlement of this tiresome question might be afforded by approaching the Iraq Government on the basis of a final cash payment, rath ex’ than that of perpetual exemption. 8, I should be glad to have your instructions in the light of the observations put forward in this despatch before I approach the Iraqi Government further in the matter.

Sir, I am directed ‘by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of hr, Williams* s letter of the 15th August, ^o, 33.314/29, relative to the exempt! .n from taxation of their date gardens in Iraq guaranteed to the Sheikh of Koweit and the Sheikh of Mohamrner-ah in return for their co-operation against the Turks in 1914* 2. hr. Benn agrees with Lord Passfield that the exemption then afforded was not Intended to attach to the property, as such, hut to hr personal to the Sheikhs and to their successors. 3. On the first of the two main points raised in Sir Gilbert Clayton’s despatch, and examined in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Colonial Office letter u der reply, Mr. Secretary Benn agrees with the course of action proposed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. As regards the sec nd of those points, he sees no xh; objection t the issue of instructions to the High Commissioner to sound the Iraq Government as to their willingness to offer a lump sum in final settlement of the claims for exemption from taxation of the two Sheikhs affected. In this connection, however, I am to invite attention to the demi-official letter fro,: the Political resident in the Persian Gulf to Gir Denys Bray dated 4th July, 1929, Ko.240-8, of which copies have already been sent to your Department, from which it appears that the Gheikh of Koweit, since the decline in his customs receipts caused by Ibn Gaud’s action in imposing a customs embargo, relies largely on the revenue iroo his Iraq // | . gardens to keep up his position. It is poa iblo, in! these circums tances, that some difficulty might be experienced in persuading the / \ Sheikh to agree to surrender his exemption, save in return for financial concessi ns wuich the Iraq Government would be reluctant • f p V to give, and it is relevant that the present annual value of the remission amounts in the caoe of Koweit to over a lakh of rupees.*io. ,1 ^ ^ ^ -S of 19S9 - British Residency and Co nsulate-Beneral, Bushire , 2^th October 1929 .

I am directed toy Mr. Secretary Henderson to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 68214/29 of August 15th, / / dealing with the subject of the exemption from taxation Z o promised to the Sheikhs of Kuweit and Mohammerah in 1914 in respect of their date gardens, and asking for the views of $k the Secretary of State as to the procedure which bould now be adopted by His Majesty’s Government Vis-a-Vis the Iraqi/ Government to secure that due effect is given to this under taking . 2. Since the matter was last discussed, Mr. Henderson’s i ^ attention has been drawn to the following aspect, which as ^ far as he is aware, has not yet received consideration. The Sheikh of Koweit is an independent foreign sovereign. The IraqtGovernment in common with all other governments, are e obliged by international law to treat him as such* Under international law a state is prohibited from exercising jurisdiction eitner oyer an independent foreign sovereign, or 0ver his property. This being so, and the IraqvGovernment being precluded by international law from exercising any jurisdiction over the Sheikh of Koweit or his property, it would not seem possible for them to tax his property, for, if ' they attempted to do so, they could not legally enforce their taxation, either by taking proceedingsjagainst the Sheikh per- sonally, or by measures taken against his property. Authority for the application by the English courts of the principles of international law conferring immunity from the jurisdiction of the property of a foreign sovereign is to be found in the cases of Vavasseur v. Erupp and the Jupiter No^I and the subject is discussed fully in P.icey’ s Gonfl.ict ofCo 4 frpu. - Laws Fourth edition at pages 208 at seq. — — A Cases such as Ilighell v. The Sultan of Johgre and The Duff Development Company v* The Gov e rmaent of Kelantan show that the rulers of small protected native states are entitled to all the immunities of independent foreign sovereigns. 3. Before considering further the question discussed in your letter under reference, or going into the other points raised therein, Mr. Henderson will be glad to receive Lord Passfield f s observations on the argument developed in the preceding paragraph. H© realises that tne argument could not be applied to the case of the Sheikh of Mohammerah who is a Persian subject; but, inasmuch as tne property of the Sheikh of Koweit is the more valuable, and the question of io its exemption from taxation would ter that extent seem likely to present the greater difficulty, he thinks that the argument is deserving of careful consideration. 4. I am to make it clear, however, that, in Mr. Henderson’s opinion, the pledges given bp His Majesty s Government to the Sheikh of Mohammerah are no less binding than those given by them to the Sheikh of Koweit. v f /hile therefore a solution of the question of the Sheikh of Koweit’s exemption on the lines suggested above would reduce con siderably the dimensions of the problem and the amount of money involved, it will still be necessary to find a satisfactory issue in so far as the Sheikh of Mohammerah is concerned. 5.

I am, Sir, Your most obedient servant, |i THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE, INDIA OFFICE.68214/29, Sir, f 11th October 1929 I arn directed by Lord Paosfield to acknowledge / the receipt of your letter of the 13th (Ibth ?} of JF September, Wo. E 4052/1358/93, regarding the exemption from taxation promised to the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah in 1914 in respect of their date gardens in Iraq, and to request you te inform Mr^Secretary Henderson that His Lordship is advised that the position in this matter of the Shaikh of Kuwait under international law is an stated in your letter. 2» Lord Passfield is advised, however, that in Mils country the question whether a person is an independent sovereign is decided by a statement by a responsible Minister that His Majesty recognises him as such, ana that a statement of this character is regarded as conclusive evidence by the Courts. It may be that in Iraq a similar procedure would have to be followed, and that a statement by a responsible Iraqi Minister that King Faisal recognis- ed * the Shaikh of Kuwait as an independent foreign sovereign would be necessary in order,that the Shaikh^ property should be removed from the jurisdiction of the local Courts. If so, it is not thought likely that King Faisal would decline so to recognise the Shaikh of Kuwait; but the x^ossibility should not be entirely ex cluded from consideration. 3, Even if, however, the Iraq Government were prepared to apply to the Shaikh’s case the principles of international law explained in your letter, thi&amp; might not, in certain cirnumstances, provide a complete and lasting solution of the difficulty. The undertaking given to the Shaikh in 1914 applied not only to himself, but also to his 'descendents’•» Consequently, if the Shaikh’s THE UKDEH SECRETARY OF STATE, FOREIGN OFFICE.2 Shaikh’s property were divided among his children upon his ' death, His Majesty’s Government would appear to be under ! an obligation to ensure that they enjoyed exemption from taxation in respect ol the date gardens in Irati, al~ though they clearly could not all independent sovereign and thtfs entitled to immunity under international law. As Mr Henderson is aware, the terms of the undertaking given to the Shaikh of Kuwait were as follows:« ¥ W y° ur gardens shall remain £n your possession and in possession of your descendents without being subject to the payment of revenue or taxes? Lord Passfield is not aware whether any partiiular signifi cance need attach to the use of the word '’descendents” instead of the more usual terra 'successors”. On a strict interpretation, the undertaking given would seem to bind His Majesty’s Government in the event of a change of £ dynasty in Kuwait, not only irtT secure for the Shaikh and his descendents immunity from taxation in respect of the date gardens in Iraq, but also to preserve that property in their undisturbed possession. Despite these possible difficulties, however, Lord Passfield is of opinion that the application of the \ principles of international law should provide at least a temporary solution of the difficulty in so far as the date gardens of the Shaikh of Kuwait are concerned, and, subject to the concurrence of Mr Henderson and of the Secretary of State for India who is also being consulted, he pro- ‘ ]j ; poses to instruct the Acting High Commissioner for Iraq to explain to the Iraq Government the position of the Shaikh ■ of Kuwait under international law, and to invite them to ; agree that, in the circumstances, they have no option but to accord the Shaikh immunity from taxation in respect of his property in Iraq. 5• As explained in your letter the argument from internationalI - 3 - international law could not, however, be applied to the case of the Shaikh of Mohammerah, and it will still be necessary to devise measures to ensure that the similar pledges of immunity from taxation given by His Hajestyls Government to the Shaikh of Mohammerah are duly aarried ©ut. With this object in view. Lord Passfield proposes to instruct the Acting High Commissioner to recommend to the Iraq Government that they should attempt in negoti ation with the Shaikh o£ Ms representative to terminate his exemption irom taxation by a lump sum payment as proposed in Sir Gilbert Clayton’s despatch of the 8th of July. If, however, the Iraq Government reject his proposal, or if they would attempt to negotiate such a settlement with the Shaikh and fail, it may still prove to be possible in connection with the negotiation of the proposed new treaty with Iraq to induce the Iraq Govern ment formally to assume on behalf of His Majestyls Govern ment the obligation towards the Shaikh. A copy^f this letter is being sent to the India I Office, and a copy of the correspondence to the Traeaury. I am. Sir, Your most obedient servant, SD/ 0. G. n. Will iarnsicret. A. The Residency, Baghdad, 30th September 1929, My Lord, / I have the honour to refer to Sir Gilbert Clayton’s despatch Secret B dated the 8th of July, i929, on the subject of the exemption from taxation enjoyed by the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohaxnmerah. 2. The precise value of the remissions accorded to these two Shaikhs has now been accurately determined by the Iraq Revenue authorities and show a smaller figure than the estimated values set out in the despatch under reference, in which it was stated that the present annual value of the remission was Rs. 1,09,590 to the Shaikh of Kuwait and Rs.40,933 to the Shaikh of Mohammerah. The revised figures show that the present annual value of the immunity is Rs. 78 y 303-4**0 to/' the Shaikh of Kuwait and Rs. 39,041-8-0 to the Shaikh of Mohammerah. The other figures given in the despatch also require correction and I, therefore, attach a detailed statement showing the amount of taxation remitted in each year since 1914 to both Shaikhs. It will be noted that the aggregate reaches a total of Rs. 14,61,078-12-0. 3. Should it be decided therefore that a solution of the problem could best be reached on the lines, as suggested by the late Sir Gilbert Clayton, of a final cash payment the amount of the payment will be considerably less than calculat ions based on the earlier figures would suggest.

Tlie question of the exerpclon of the date gardens ol the Suaikhs of Huhainmeral.i. and Kuwait from taxation has bee- the subject of correspondence between the ’Tran Government and Ills Excellency the High Commission since tire early days of 1924. The ’Iran Government had considered and continue to Consider that this exemption is illegal and hat its continuance requires a. special law under article 92 of the Organic Lhwr. At the same time the e' Iraq. Governmenu consideredithat'the promise .or exemption given to the two Sheikhs in question by Colonel Knox,- the f then) Br' 11 s ; President and Consul' General In the Persian Gul. could be held to be binding on the ’Irac CoYern.uent. Hence the said Government have seen no justification for submitting to Parlia ent a draft law for the legalisation of this exemption. This question is not included in for does not come within' the undertakings which His Britanie Majesty’s Government ia under obligation to see carried out in respect of. ’Iraq Treaty 1922. On the other hand,, the ’Iraq. Government belive that the exemption enjoyed hitherto by the two Shaikhs is a sufficient reward for the services rendered by them in the early days of the war. s regards thm Shaikh of ^ahammerah in particular, thouga he enjoyed a measure of quasi self government he was deemed a Persian subject and did not posses the quality of independent ruler(Vmir). Assuming that he, was (then) an independent xlor hr has since forfeited all his rights and privileges and he no longer possesses the quality which he enjoyed wren he was promiseci exemption. Hr- last development in the question under discussion, as ay be gathered from previous correspondency, was that in August 1927, the ’Iraq Government requested His Excellency the High Commissioner to approach the British Government once inor t on the subjectand decided to defer decision in the matter pending receipt of t e resultM'Jj , oT I r is ''xcellenc^ tie T’igi.. ^oiui; issic^fer’s representation: t the British Government.

It appears that no reply has yet been received froin the British Government. is, in view of the reasons set forth hereinabove 5 the ’Trap Government are onable to allow the continuance of the exemption of the gardens of the two Ghaikhs from taxation, they h^ve adopted the following resolutions:- (a) The continuance of the,exemption is not legally justifiable.

This list was complied in order Government regarded the ’Iraq.

I : IPARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the Acting High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Dated 4th December. (Received, Colonial Office, 5.10 p.m., 4th December, 1929). Ho. 456. ^ Your Secret despatch of 4th [November. I find seme difficulty^ acting upon the instructions conveyed in your despatch under reference. Regarding Moharamerah from enclosed correspondence it appears that you regard matter as one which should be dealt with under Article IV of Treaty but the despatch itself is silent upon this point and the Foreign Office having reserved their view I am not clear as to whether Article X or Article IV is to be invoked. I hesitate to invoke Article IV as it appears to me that although Article X has never 1 * 1 , actually been invoked thart~ fact that thins-obiigations were included in the list presented in 1927 to Ja'far Pasha invoked it by implication. In the event of this being so, to invoke Article IV at this stage would suggest that H.M, Government regard these exemptions merely as their own financial obligation and it might be argued reasonably that it is not the intention of Article IV to enable H.M. Government to transfer their own financial obligations to the Government of Iraq. A similar argument applies with regard to Koweit with the additional disadvantage that in this case the reply might be that if the Sheikh* of Koweit was by international law exempt from taxation in Iraq as an independent foreign sovereign the undertaking given by H.M. Goverment was valueless at the time it was given. H.M.Government must, I feel, decide whether these exemptions are or are not international obligations which the Government of Iraq is bound to implement and must either invoke Article X and if they fail to induce the King and Cabinet to pass an ordinance under Article 26(a) of the Organic Law must be prepared to submit the question to arbitration under the Treaty, or if they are not prepared to do this must refrain from exercising further pressurepressure on Iraq Government* The Iraq Goverranent have raised the question once more and I should be glad to receive further instructions as soon as possible.

It is not suggested that the obligations of His Majesty’s Government to the two Shal&amp;hs are not covered by the general terms of that Article, but the Iraq, Governmer^ were informed ^r. Davidson’s letter Bo. P.0.?5 of the 17th of April, 1924, a copy of which wa© enclosed In Colon* si Office letter i.-f ^ 150.4015^/27 of ttia 21st of Gepteniber, 1937, t’aat those undertakings to the two Shaikhs were 'a minor obligation” which it was not thought necessary to allude to In the Hotes exchanged under Article 10 (copies of which will , be found on pages 54 to 56 of Colonial Ho. 13, the reportto December, 1924, and thrt ri i.n view of the difficulties of settling a matter of this Mn&amp; at the present juncture His Majesty 1 s Government haw decided not to include these obligations to the Shaihhs concerned among the Agreenients covered by Article 10 of the Treaty unless the Iraq, Oovemment desU’es to r dq. so?. Sir. IU- /ta &amp;(a ivU XX)C i/[lir ^ Dobbs* letter of the 26 th of Marchrl^, was written for the eaEpress purpose of agreeing as to the Treaties And Agreements covered by Article 10 of the 1922 Anglo- Iraq Treaty, and the Treaties and Agreements set out in that letter did not include the undertakings to the two Shaikhs. In their reply of the 10th of July, the Irat Government accepted, as covered by Article 10,the Treaties and Agreements set out in Sir II.Dobbs 1 letter of the 26th of March, lord Passfield is advised therefore that Artlela 10 of the 1922 Treaty must now be construed together with those two letters and, that In consequence His Majesty*s Government would find it difficult to argue that the undertakings to the ^wo Shaikhs are covered by Article 10. nevertheless, tn.s Lordship does not consider that this impli es that the Iraq Government are not bound to give effect to those undertakings. They were informed of their existence in Mr .Davidson* s letter of the 17th of April, 1924, to which reference is made above. In their reply to Sir H. Dobbs’ letter of the 26th of March, 1924, the Iraq Government did not refer to or take exception to the obligations to the two Shaikhs and as they continued to accord exemption from taxation to the ikhs t could reasonably have been assumed at that time that the Iraq Government recognised their liability to continue to accord such exemption. It was not until the end of 19 d 6 some two years after the ratification of the 192^ Treaty that/tft&amp;t the aueation was agaiB raised by the Trag Goyerrwrt who then contended that the exemptions hitherto accorded we.e i3.1ega3. and could not be continued. In August 1927 the Iraq, Government again stated that the exemptions could not be continued without legislative sanction and that they were not prepared to introduce the necessary legislation for the purpose, ihiey then requested that the matter should be referred to His Majesty’s Government. 3. At the time of the negotiation of the Anglo- Iraq treaty of the 14th of December, X9B7 (which has not been ratified or entered into force), the Iraqi Dele^ites ashed for and ’were furnished with a mamcrsndum containing a list of British international obligations in respect of Iraq., fhe promises given to the two Shaikhs of immunity from taxation in respect of their date gardens In Iraq were mentioned in the meiacrsndum and no objection to the terns of that memorandumw as raised by the Iraqi Delegates during the course of the negotiations. His Majesty’s Government had therefore, every reason to believe that the Iraq Government weie prepared to recognise the obligations to the two Shallths, though they had not expressly stated that they were willing to do so, or expressly accepted the memorandum as an accurate statement cf British international obligations In respect of Iraq* It was not unt il the middle of this year that it again became evident that the Iraq Government were unwilling to honour these obligations. The mention of these undertakings to the two Shaikhs in the memcrancium handed to the Iraqi Delegation at the time of the negotiation of the IDS? freaty might be held to have implied that they were in fact covei’ed by Article 10 of the 1922 Treaty although they/they had not boen Epocif.ioal^f meiit^033©d in the Uxelism^e cC Hot es undex tluit ArtloXo, but* .i^ox^d Xassfl^lA is adirl aed that Article 10 could not properly be Invoked for the purpose of call ins upon th© Iraq Got emiBent to Honour those o cl isat ions* he 1 c E&amp;Tised* havevexH tlia t the undertaking to tiie two Shailchs could roperly be regarded as cot© red by the expression ^the international and financial obligations 1 ox His Britannic Majesty in Article 4 of the XtSS fre&amp;ty arid that His Majesty’s GoTemment could properly contomt that in virtue of that Article the Iraq Government were bound to honour those undert* Icings* 4. Apart, however, from any spooifio Treaty obligation on the part of the Iraq Government it appears to Lord Passflelu that there are other considerations which alone justify the contention of His Majesty's Government that the Iraq Government should honour these obligations and which ral^t appropriately be brou^it to the notice of the Iraq Govermaent* m the first Place there Is the consideration to which reference is male In paragraph 4 of Colonial Office letter Ho* 401L7/27 of the 21st of September, VM*?. This consideration was empiiaslsed and endorsed by the Flnanotal Mb* ion to Iraq, in »ar*g*®h 2 of ti» Appendix to thBix .opart of the 25th of April, 1^5 (see CM.2438). 5 .

It could therefore be contended that the liability to continue to accord exemption from taxation to the two Shalhhs in accordance with the promises made to them on behalf of His Majesty’s Government was one of the liabilities for which the Iraq. Government assumed responsibility in this general 6 * Tnirdly, although it^a^pvajro ^ux^xty* Office letter, Ho. 1.^139/5833/65 of the 10th of Hovember, 1936, that it cannot be said that there is any definite accepted rule of International law which automatical!:/' subrogates a succeeding State to the oontractura! rights and obligations of Its predecessor, modem usage of nations has tended to the aotoowl®dgment of such obligations and His Lordship understands that It is the generally accepted practice that on the tr^isxer from one State to another of responsibility for the Administration of any area the State to which the responsibility is transferred should, in the absence of any express provision to the contrary, at the same time tehe over the assets and liabilities attaching to the area in question. It would appear, therefore, that it could fairly be contended that, when the responsibility for the Administration of Iraq passed from His Majesty’s Government to the Iraq Government, the latter Government, ipso facto assumed responsibility for continuing the exemption from taxation premised to the two Shaibhs. 7 . In all the circumstances, it appears to Lord Passfield that Hi© Majesty’s Government are on strong settlement. grounds from the point of view of e©iity, international practice/pr&amp;otic© aisd treaty obligations in contending tint thee© undertakings to the two Shaikhs are ©Kligatlons which the Iraq. GoVerment a^e bound to implement and he considers that if the Iraq. Government are unwilling to honour these obligations His Majesty’s Ooverment should claim that the cjiie stion should be referred to arbitration under Article Vr of the 1923 Treaty* 8 * There arc, however, certain difficulties in the way of arbitration upon which Lord Passfleld would be glad to be furnished with the views of Mr.Henderson. Article V7 of the 1922 Anglo-Iraq. Treaty provides for arbitration only as to the Interpretation of the actual provisions of the Treaty. It would appear therefore that the only question which could be referred to arbitration is whether in fact these obligations to the two Shaikhs are covered by irticle 4 of the Treaty, nevertheless, His Lordship considers that His Majesty*s Government should, if necessary, be prepared to refer this question to arbitration. He is of the opinion that if the Iraq Government realise that His Majesty 1 © Govcftameni are determined if necessary to submit the question to arbitration they will probably be prepared to honour the imdertakings to the two shaikhs, for, whatever the decision of the arbitrator, the Iraq Government could hardly fell to be shown up in an unfavourable light during the course of the arbitral proceedings. They would probably be unwilling that the first case. In which they mm Interested, to be referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice should **' — (S be a case which, whatever the decision, would bo bound to reflect discredit upon them... . *\i i /OQ | ' v^ 7 9 * Oob^ect to l®r«Anders an* b cone irreme aM to tr t © concurronoe of tJic Cocretar^ of State for India, who is also being consulted on the subject, Lord Pasafield would propose to infom the High Commissioner that His HaJestj 1 © GoTorment consider that these obligations to the two Shaitt® properly fell to he dealt with under Article 4 of the 193a treaty, and that he should therefore approach the Ira&amp; Government once more with the request that they should honour these undertaking* which His Majesty*s Government regard a© freaty obligations which the Iraq Government are bound, in virtue of Article 4 of the 1933 Treaty, to Implement. The High Comiss loner would, at the same time, be given discretion to ma£® such use as he considers fit of the arguments referred to In the preceding paragi*aphs of this letter and authorised to iuf03 the Iraq Government that, if they are unwilling to honour these undertakings, His Majesty’s Government will have no alternative but to oXa im that the ma&lt;Jtcr should be referred to arbitration uiider Article IV of the 1923 Treaty# Lord Passfield would also propose to Instruct the High Commissioner to suggest to the Iraq Government that they should endeavour to effect a final settlement with the Shaikh of Mohammerah by offering him a lump sum in respect of Ms claim to exemption from taxation. Th* mm of the Shaikh of Kuwait should present less difficulty since the High Commissioner is in a position to Invite the Iraq Government to agree that, In virtue of the shaikh*s position as an independent foreign sovereign, they h&amp;m no alternative but to accord to Mm immunity from taxation in respect of his property in Iraq* 10# If the Iraq Governamnt are doubtftil of their ab ility/ability to obtajn Perilaanetlon for tho ® 3 »mptionB j)ropo£?od bxsfc are unwilling to accord those exemptions without such sanation their attention- might be draim to the opinion expressed in the last paragraph of the letter of the ZZrA of February, 19^7, from Eaouf Beg Chadirehl who, at that time, was act5^: m Iraq.1 Minister of Justice.

Secretary Henderson to state that he has had under consideration your letter No. 68214/29 of December 23rd, regarding the exemption from taxation of the date gardens in Iraq, owned by the Sheikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah, and that he is in general agreement with the arguments advanced in that letter and with the course of action proposed in paragraphs 9-12 thereof. 2. As regards the difficulties in the way of arbitratioi to which reference was made in paragraph 3 of your letter, and on which Lord Passfield desired the views oi Mr. Henderson, the Secretary of State is of opinion that they are not of a nature to deter His Majesty's Government, should trie arguments indicated in your letter fail to convince the Iraqi Government that they are bound to implement the undertakings given to the two Sheikhs, from claiming that the question be xsfsxsx referred to arbitration. 3. Ther^kre, however, certain considerations entailed by the adoption of this course, to which I am to invite the attention of Lord Passfield. The Secretary of State is advised that , if there is any possibility of this question at some time being submitted to arbttratioi or to the Permanent 0 ^urt of International Justice at The Hague, care should be taken in the meantime to make no statement which would prejudice the use of any argument before that Court which sosiaia: Counsel on oehalf of His Majesty’s Government might think good to puu forward at the time. Consequently The Under Secretary Of State Calonlat- QFFic-ECohseguently, althougl r. Henderson shares Lord. Passfielc view that the argument based on Article 10 of the 1922 Treaty has great weaknesses, he considers that care should he taken not to abandon this argument, or to say anything which would preclude the use of it at a later stage. 4. In the second place, it is clear (as stated in paragraph 8 of your letter) that His Majesty’s Government, if they were to take the matter to The Hague Court unilaterally, could only do so under Article 17 of the Treaty, and under that Article could only ask for the decision of the Court on the dispute so far as it arises out of the interpretation or application of She Treaty. The Secretary of State is however advised that His Majesty' Government should endeavour in the first place to induce the Iraqi Government to submit the question by a special agreement, rather than allow the matter to be brought before the Court by an unilateral application; and also that in that event an autempt should be made to ensure that the special agreement be drafted in the widest possible terms. For instance the special agreement might provide for the submission to the Court of a question formed on the following lines 'Are the Iraqi Government obliged, under the provisions of the Treaty of Alliance of 1922, or under the rules of international law, to continue to accord exemption from taxation to the date gardens of the two Shaikhs. ?' In order to induce the Iraqi Government to agree to the submission of the question by means of a special agreement, the pride and amour p rppre of The Iraqi Government might be played on by pointing out that it is much more in accordance with their dignity willingly to submit the whole question in dispute to the Court (in the manner which under the Optional Clause all the Great Powers have now undertaken or are about to undertake, to adopt in their relations with each other), than to be forced to appear before V e Court by unilateral application underI under Article 17 of the Treaty in a manner which might even then leave some points of dispute still open. 5. If however the Iraq.! Government refuse to make a special agreement, and consequently the case has to he submitted to The Hague Court by unilateral application, rr. aenuarson is advised that His Majesty's Government staHi: should frame their application in general terms with reference to the whole Treaty, rather than confine the themselves to a refernnce to a single article of the Treaty, 6 » Laotly, as the Attorney General has expressed the view that, in the event oT a case in which His Majesty’s Government are a party being referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice, his directions should be taken as to whether it is necessary for a £pw Officer to appear, Lord Passfield may wish to consider whether it is desirable that the 4,aw Officer should he consulted before His Majesty’s Government become committed to referring this case to the Court. In the event of Lord Passfield considering that this course is desirable, I am to suggest that the High Commissioner for Irag should receive instructions to the effect that he should not actually propose to the Iraqi Government a resort to arbitration or to the rermanent Court, until he has referred the question to His Lordship by telegram, 7.

On 10th October, 1922, a Treaty of Alliance between Great Britain and iratf/was signed at Baghdad, a copy cm that His Britannic Majesty shall be represented in Iraq by in .November 1914 in order to ensure the assistance sion situate between Bao and Cpirhah should remain m his possession and in possession of his deCendants without being taxation. The date gardens referred to in their letter are ■which is enclosed. Ratifications were exchanged at Baghdad on 19th December 1924. Article 1 of the Treaty provides aa- 2 « 'V,.

By Article 4 of the Treaty the &amp;ing of Iraq without prejudice to the provisions of Articles il and 18 of the Treaty agrees to be guided by the advice of Bis Britannic Majesty tendered through the High Commissioner on all important matters affecting the international and financial obligations and interests of His Britannic Majesty for the 1 whole period of the treaty. His Majesty the Bing of Iraq also agrees that he will fully consult the High Commissioner on which is conducive to a sound financial ana fiscal policy and that he will assure the stability and good organisation of the finances of the Iraq Government as long as that Government is under financial obligations to the Government of His Britannijc Majesty. By Article 10 of the Treaty the nigh Contracting Parties agree to conclude separate agreements to secure the execution any treaties, agreements or undertakings which His Britannic Majesty is under obligation to see carried out in respect of Iraq, His Majesty the Bing Iraq undertakes to bring in by legislation necessary to ensure the execution of these agreement s. This Article also provides that such agreements shall be communicated to the Council of the League of nations. By Article 17 of the Treaty any difference which may arise between the High Contracting Parties as to the inter pretation of the provisions of the Treaty is to be referred to the Permanent Court of international Justice provided for by Article 14 of the Covenant of the League of nations. 3. On 26th March 1924 Sir H. Dobbs the High Commissioner for Iraq communicated to the Prima Minister of Iraq by letter a list of the Treaties, Agreements and Undertakings which His Majesty’s Government considered were referred to in Article 10 of the Treaty and requested that he might receive an official reply notifying the. concurrence of the Government of Iraq. A copy of this letter is enclosed. it will be observed in this letter no reference is ina.de to the agreements with the Shaikh of Kuwait or the Shaikh of Moiiammerah regarding the exemption from taxation of their date gardens.On 17th April, 1924, Mr Davidson the Counsellor to the High Corami8sioner for Iraq ^rote to the rrime Minister for xx Iraq pointing out that in the letter of 26th March no reference was made to the obligations to the shaikhs of xxXsoc tha t Kuwait and Mohammerah and/their date gardens should always be exempt from taxation, on the ground that the matter was a miuor obligation in respect of Iraq which the sritish govern ment contracted at the very commencement of the campaign for the liberation of Iraq in 1914. A copy of this letter is ^ enclosed herewith. Mr Davidson also pointed out chat the High Commissioner felt sure that the iraq Govermnent would regoguise the obligation as a debt of honour to those who helped in the campaign in its early and most doubtful stages and that in view of the difficulties of settling the matter at that juncture His Hritannic majesty’s Government had decided not to include these obligations to the Shaikhs Treaty, uftiess the Iraq Government desired to do so, and that the matter might be reserved for subsequent settlement between the two governments. On 10th July 1924 the jrrime minister of iraq replied (copy attached) to the letter dated 26th March 1924 stating-that the iraq Government had accepted the Agreements, Treaties and obligations referred to in Art icle 10 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty and mentioned in the nigh Commissioner’s letter of 26th March 1924. it will be observed that in this letter no reference is made to Mr Davidson’s letter of 17th April 1924 as to the obligation to exempt the date gardens of one two Shaikhs from taxation. The iraq Government did, however, continue to accord . exemption from taxation of date gardens in question and the matter was not re-opened by the iraq Government until Decem ber 1926, after the Elapse of more than two years. Un 10th August 1927 zhe secretary to the Council of Ministers informed the Secretary to the High Commissioner ^=5* that provisions of the Organic Daw were clear as to the necessity of collecting the tax and that it was impossible to continue the exemption exvept by a special law and that it-4- v,„ U4 . / :i it was doubtful whether the law would be passed having* regard to the political and economic conditions of the country la copy of the letter is enclosed herewith). 4* On the 14th December 1927 a new Anglo-iraq Treaty was entered into but such Treaty has not seen ratified or enterejj into force. At the time of the negotions of the Anglo™ 1 i jj t Iraq Treaty of the 14th December 1927 the Iraqi Delegates asked for and were furnished with a memorandum containing a list of the British international obligations in respect of Iraq,. The promises given to the two Shaikhs from immunity from taxation in respect of their date gardens in iraq were mentioned in the memorandum and no objection to the terms of, that memorandum was raised by the Iraqi Dele gat enduring the course of the negotiations, his Mejsty's Government had therefore reason to conclude that the iraq Government were prepared to recognise the obligation^ to the two shaikhs &gt;I! though they had not expressly stated that they were willing to do so or expressly accepted the memorandum as an accurate statement of British international obligations in respect of iraq. It was not until the middle of last year that it again became evident that the iraq eminent were unwil^in^ to honour these obligations. The matter had in the meanwhile been considered by the ! ^ Financial Mission appointed by the Secretary of state in March 1925 to enquire into the Financial Position and Drosi^ects of the Government of iraq and such Mission recom™ j mended that the Government of Iraq should withdraw any claim that the obligation to'the two Shaikhs should be made pb| a charge upon Great Britain. Cmd 2438 see paragraph VIII of Appendix at pages 61 and 62 copy enclosed. it will be observed that the Kevenue involved is stated to have originally amounted to Ks. 8^,000 annum and that the amount has(sinee been increased by a cnange in the rate of taxation to Rs. 1,20,000 per armuiji. The total amount of taxation remitted by the British Govermoent between jt&amp;ifcX 1914 and 1920 tiias R^ • 6,12,048.8-b namely, in reject of the propertites of the Bheii^i of Kuwait •: . Rs. 4,04*998.2 and in reject of the properties of the Sheikh.of. ' Mohammerah at Rs. 2,07050;6. • ^ While the te^ee not collected by the Iraq Government 1 4 « 'I P between 1921 and 1928 amount to ks . 8,49030.4 namely res. 5, 65086.14 on the Sheikh of Kuwait’s garden and ks. 2, 83943.6 on the Sheikh of Mohammerah’s garden. 5. Apart from the definite treaty obligations on the part of the Iraq Government to honour these obligations it appears to Lord 'assfield that there are other coneideratiobs which justify the contention of His Majesty’s Government that £ the Iraq government should continue to honour these obligation; in the first place Iraq was captured from the Turks at great cost to the British nation and the Territory so captured has been handed over to the new state of Iraq and i | the obligations given by His Majesty’s Government for victory in Iraq. In the second place in the general financial settlement between His Majesty’s Government ana Iraq wiiieh was effected as from 1st April 1921, the Iraq Government took j Hfjfl over all the assets of the Civil Administration (with the exception of certain assets derived from military expend!tuie J vote of credit or army funds; and assumed responsibility for all civi^ charges in the future in return for the assumption c 0 1 S by His Majesty’s Government of resx-&gt;onsibility for the net deficit of the civil administration on 3lst March 1921. - ! | Tt is accordingly open, co contention that the liability co continue to accord exemption irom taKa^ion -o the tv^u Shaikhs in accordance with the promise made to them on L !• irV behalf of His l^ajesty’s Government was one of the liabilities for which the Iraq Government assumed responsibility in this if i H i i ;l I! general settlement. Thirdly, altnough -Lord Hassfield understands that it cannot be said that there is any definite accepted rule of international law which automatically subrogates a succeding State to the contractional rights and obligations ol | its predecessor modern usage of nations has uended to uLel j H) i ! the acknowledgement of such obligations and his Lordship understands that it is the generally accepted practice that &lt;3* i on the transfer from one State to another of responsibility ! for the administration of any area the State to which the responsibility is transferred should, in the absence of 4 %. any express provision to the contrary, at the same time taice over the assets and liabilities attaching to the area in question. it would appear, therefore, that it could fairly be contended that, when the responsibility for the Administratioi of Iraq passed from His Majesty's Government to the Iraq Government the latter Government ii STso facto assumed r as pur!',': responsibility for continuing the exemption from taxation : . . ,, ' ' p i .. t 1 SI ; i-* promised to the two Sheikhs. 6, Having regard to ail the circumstances it appears to Lord Hassfield that there are good reasons from the point of 1 view of equity, international practice and treaty obligations for contending that the undertakings given to the two Shaikhs are obligations which the Iraq Government are bound M to implement and that if the Iraq Government are not prepared^ j honour these obligations the question should be referred to arbitration unuer Article 17 0- one Treaty 01 1922* 7, arbitration. Article 17 of the Anglo- Iraq Treaty ot 1922 provides that any difference that may arise between here are, however, certain difficulties in the way 01 ^ the contracting parties as to the interpretation of the - ’ provisions of the treat' shall be referred to aroitration ana” j it would therefore appear that the only question which could f 5 I A iwl ti m ■ 1 be referred to arbitration is the question whether the i- obligations to the two Shaikhs are covered by provision 01 the Treaty. Having regard to the fact that the obligations to The Shaikhs W ere not mentioned in the letter dated 2dth ( March, 1924 from the High Commissioner to the Hrime Minister of Iraq there would appear to be some difficulty in maintaing that such obligations are covered by Article 10 of the Treaty. -^ord Passfield is, however, advisee that if thei^e is any possibility of the question 01 the w9. the obligations to the two tJheiisns being subi 1 . ced to arbitaration or to the Pe^Fianent Court of International Justice at the Hague care should be taken, in the naantime 7 j j to make no statement or admission which might prejudice the use of any argument founded on Article 10 of the treaty. Lord Passfield is also advisea that if the matter is referred, unilaterally to the Permanent Court of international justice at the Hague it could only be so referred under Article 17 of the Treaty and that under that Article His majesty’s Government could only ask for the decision &lt;fif the Court on the matters in dispute in so far as such matters arise out of the interpretation or application of the Treaty*. In such circumstances it appears to be desirable that the Government of Iraq, should be induced to submit the (question to arbitration by special agreement and that the agreement ^ should be drafted in the widest possible terms in order that the terms of reference may include not only the question whether the Iraqi Government are obliged to continue the exemption from taxation under the terms of the treaty but a Is, whether they are so obligeu uniter the rules of international , ' J law» Should the Iraqi Government refuse to enter into a special agreement to refer the matter in dispute to the Hague and the matter has to be referred to the Hague by the unilateral application of His Majesty’s Government Lord Passfield is advised that the application should, be framed in general terms and not with reference to any single - or particular Article of the Treaty, 8. A further point arises in that the Sheikh of Kuwait is an independent' sovereign and would presumably have to be recognise^ by Ting ^ai^al as such. In + hat case there would be no jurisdiction in Iraq over his property. It appears to be doubtful however whether this is a point which could properly be dealt with in the proposed arbitration, since it would seem rather to be matter ior the local Courts if ana when &amp; legal claim is made to tax his property*9. In these circumstances i am to request that you will be good enough to furnish .Lord rassfield with your opinion generally and in particular on the following questions :« 1) Do you agree that it would be advisable if possible, to iMuce the Iraqi Government to agree to a special reference to the Permanent Court of international justice at the Hague and that such reference should be framed in the widest- possible terms in order to include not only the question whet.er the Iraqi Government are obliged to continue the exertion from taxation under the terms of the Treaty but also under the rules of international law V (2) if it is inpossible to induce the iraoi Government to agree to submit a special reference to the Hague do you agree that it would be open to His Majesty^ Government to refer the mat er to the Hague under the provisions of Article 17 of the Tre aty? (3) if the answer to Question (2; is in the affirmative would such reference^ in your opinion, be confined to the inter pretation of the provisions of the Treaty and whether the obligations to the two Shaikhs are covered by Article 4 or Article 10 of the Treaty ? (4) if it is possible and becomes necessary to refer the matter to the Hague do you agree that the reference should be framed in general terms and not with reference to xjqc any particular article of me Treaty and that in the meantime no admission should be made by or on behalf of His £$&amp; Majesty’s Government which might be construed as an abandon^ ment by His Majesty’s Government of the right to raise trie question under Article 10 of the Treaty ? (5) Whether, in your opinion, there is a reasonable prospect oi success if the matter is (a ) referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice at the Hague by His Majesty’s Govern^ ment pursuant to Article 17 of the Treaty, (b; referred to arbitration in vifctue of a special reference framed anarm? upon the lines suggested in paragraph 9(1; above.

They would be glad to have an opportunity of considering the Law Officers' opinion before 'any further representations are made to the Iraq Government. I am to add that if Their Lordships should concur in due course in the suggestion being made to the Iraq Government that the matter should be referred to arbitration it would be on the footing that His Mujesty s Government is morally bound to tame all practicable steps to see that the Iraq' Government gives effect to the promises made to the Shaikhs in ±9x4.

The Secretary of State is aavised that it would he desirable to embody in the draft reference to the law Officers of the Crown some observations in regard to the applicaoility of article 4 in the 1922 Treaty, on theh.ff lines indicated in paragraph S of your letter No.68^14/29 of December 23rd. I am accordingly to suggest that, after the sentence ending with the words 'are covered cy Article 10 of the Treaty' in line 19 of paragraph 7 of the draft reference, a passage should be added to tne following effect: 'On the other hand, it 'seems procsble that reliance could be placed on Article 4 ' of the Treaty. The undertakings to the Sheikhs could, lord Passfield considers, reasonably be described as an important -- matter affecting the international and financial obligations 'of His Britannic Majesty, and thus a matter upon which the 'Iraqi Government are unaer an obligation to be guided by the 'advice of His Britannic Majesty , 11 Commissioner.

Mr Henderson is advised that this qualification is necessary in order to avoid the risk of over-staternent. (20 In line 7 of the second sub-paragrapn in paragraph 7, after the words 'in general terms', insert toe words 'with 'reference to the whole Treaty'. (3) In the following line, substitute the words 'any 'particular Article or Articles' for the words 'any single 'or particular Article' (4) In line 3 of paragraph 6, omit the words 'have to' after the words ' would presumably'.

(6) At the end of paragraph 9 (1), insert toe words 'by reason of the financial settlement of 1921 ana' before the words 'under the rules of international law 1 !

Mr. Secretary Benn is inclined, ftr the reasons 7 indicated below, to think it advisable that the opinion of the Lav/ Officers should be taken specifically on the following question, v/hich he accordingly suggests might be induced in paragraph of the draft Reference ”Lo you consider that the reference to the Hague Court should be so framed as to cover the question whether in view of the status of the Sheikh of Koy/eit as an ^- independent sovereign the Iraq authorities would have any legal right to make an order for taxation against him ? 3. He would also suggest the omission of the third sub- -paragraph of paragraph 6 of the draft Reference to the Law Officers.

Prima facie and subject to the opinion of the law Officers it seems to Mr. Benn that there may he an advantage in including in the arbitration the point referred to in paragraph 2 above since it seems not : improbable that the International Court would give a ruling favourable to the Sheikh, whereas if that Court maker no pronouncement on the subject it may be an open question how the Iraq Courts would decide the question oi the rignts of the Iraq authorities or of their own jurisdiction, especially if tne arbitration on the other questions submitted should have one against His Majesty’s Government. b.

A copy of the , 1914. letter is enclosed. Cn 2lst November, 1914, a letter v., 1914. (copy enclosed herewith) was addressed by the British Resident in the Persian Gulf and Kis Majesty’s Consul- General for Pars to the Shaikh of Mohammerah in which he was also promised that in consideration for the assistance he had rendered to the British Government the date garden he then possessed on the Turkish side of the Sha11-al-Arab should remain in full possession of himself and his heirs and immune from taxation. The date gardens referred to in these letters are situated in territory which has now become part of Iraq. 2. On 10th October, 1922, a Treaty of Alliance between Great Britain and Iraq was signed at Baghbad, The Law Officers of the Crown.a copy of which is enclosed. Ratifications were exchanged at Baghdad on 19th December, 1924* Article 1 of the Treaty provides that His Britannic Majesty shall be represented in Iraq by a High Commissioner. By Article 4 of the Treaty the King of Iraq without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 17 and 18 of the Treaty agrees to be guided by the advice of His Britannic Majesty tendered through the High Commissioner on all important matters affecting the international and financial obligations and interests of His Britannic Majesty for the whole period of the Treaty. His Majesty the King of Iraq also agree/) that he will fully consult the High Commissioner on what is conducive to a sound financial and fiscal policy and that he will assure the stability and good organisation of the finances of the Iraq Government so long as that Government is under financial obligations to the Govern ment of His Britannic Majesty. By Article 10 of the Treaty the High Contracting Parties agree to conclude separate agreements to secure the execution of any treaties, agreements or undertakings which His Britannic Majesty is under obligation to see carried out in respect of Iraq. His Majesty the King of Iraq undertakes to bring in any legislation necessary to ensure the execution of these agreements. This Article also provides that such agreements shall be communicated to the Council of the League of Nations. By Article 17 of the Treaty any difference which may arise between the High Contreoting Parties as to the interpretation of the provisions of the Treaty is to be referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice provided for by Article 14 of the Covenant of txie League of Nations. 5. On 26th March, 1924, Sir H.Dobbs the High Commission er for Iraq communicated to the Prime Minister of Iraq byby letter a list of the Treaties, Agreements and Undertakings which His Majesty’s Government considered were referred to in Article 10 of the Treaty and requested that he might receive an official reply notify ing the concurrence of the Government of Iraq* A copy .. 1924» of this letter is enclosed. It will be observed that in this letter no reference is made to the agreements with the Shaikh of Kuwait or the Shaikh of Mohammerah regarding the exemption from taxation of their date gardens. On 17th April, 1924, Mr. Davidson the Counsellor to the High Commissioner for Iraq wrote to the Prime Minister of Iraq pointing out that in the letter of 26th March no reference was made to the obligations to the Shaikh of Kuwait and Mohammerah that their date gardens should always be exempt from taxation, on the ground that the matter was a minor obligation in respect of Iraq which the British Government contracted at the very commencement of the campaign for the liberation of 1924. Iraq in 1914. A copy of this letter is enclosed herewith. Mr. Davicson also pointed out that the High Commissioner felt sure that the Iraq Government would recognise the obligation as a debt of honour to those who helped in the campaign in its early and most doubtful stages and that in view of the difficulties of settling the matter at that' juncture His Britannic Majesty’s Government had decided not to include these obligations to the Shaikhs concerned among the Agreements covered by Article 10 of the Treaty* unless the Iraq Government desired to do so, and that the matter might be reserved for subsequent settlement between the two governments. On 10th July, ;, 1924 . 1924, the Prime Minister of Iraq replied(copy attached/ to the letter dated 26th March, 1924, stating that the Iraq Government had accepted the Agreements, Treaties and Obligations referred to in Article 10 of the Angla- Iraq Treaty and mentioned in the High Commissioner’s letter:* t 1927 » ! letter of 26th March, 1924. It will he observed that in this letter no reference is made to Mr. Davidson’s letter of 17th April, 1924, as to the obligation to exempt the' date gardens of the two Shaikhs from taxation. The Iraq Government did, however, continue to accord exemption from taxation of the date gardens in question and the matter was not re-opened by the Iraq Government until December, 1926, after the elapse of more than two years• On 10th August, 1927, the Secretary to the Council of Ministers informed the Secretary to the High Commis sioner tha.t the provisions of the Organic Lav were clear as to the necessity of collecting the tax and that it was impossible to continue the exemption excei't by a special law and that it was doubtful whether the low would be passed having regard to the political and economic conditions of the country( a copy of the letter is enclosed herewith). 4* On the 14th December, 1927, a new Angla-Iraq Treaty was entered into but such Treaty has not been ratified and has not entered into force. At the time of the negotiation of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of the 14th December, 1927, the Iraqi Delegates asked for and were furnished with a memorandum containing a list of the British International obligations in respect of 1 rr; Q * The promises given to the two Shaikhs of immunity 1 rom taxation in respect of their date gardens in Iraq were mentioned in the Memorandum and no objection to the terms of that Memorandum was raised by the Iraqi Delegates during the course of the negotiations. His Majesty’s Government had therefore reason to conclude that the Iraq Government were prepared to recognise the obligations to the two Shaikhs though they had not expressly stated that they were willing to do so or expressly accepted the memorandum as/4o as an accurate statement of British International obligations in respect of Iraq* It was not until the middle of last year that it sgain became evident that the Iraq Government•were unwilling to honour these obligations# The matter had in the meanwhile been considered by the Financial Mission appointed by the Secretary of State in March, 1925, to enquire into the Financial Position and Prospects of the Government of Iraq and such Mission recommended that the Government of Iraq should withdraw any claim that the obligation to the two Shaikhs should be made a charge upon Great Britain. (See Cmd. 2338, paragraph VIII of Appendix at pages 61 and 62, copy enclosed). It will be observed that the Revenue involved is stated to have originally amounted to Rs♦ 87,000 per annum and that the amount has since been increased by a change in the rate of taxation to Rs. 1,20,000 per annum. The total amount of taxation remitted by the British Government between 1914 and 1920 was Rs. 6,12,048.8 namely in respect of the properties of the Shaikh of Kuwait Rs. 4,04,998.2 and in respect of the properties of the Shaikh of Mohammerah at Rs. 2,07,050.6. While the taxes not collected by the Iraq Government )etween 1921 and 1928 amount to Rs. 8,49,030.4 namely *s• 5,65,086.14 on the Shaikh of Muwait’s garden and is. 2,83,943.6 on the Shaikh of Mohammerah’s garden. 5. Apart from any definite treaty obligations oh the Dart of the Iraq Government to honour these obligations It appears to Lord Passfield that there are other considers tions which justify the contention of His Majesty’s Government that the Iraq Government should continue to honour these obligations# In the first place Iraq was captured from the Turks nf /meat cost to the British nation and the territory so captured has Been handed over J^^govern- I ran and the obligations given by his Ma &gt;) e ®,R, s ment to the two Shaikhs were only a very small rrice naid by His Majesty’s Government for victory in Iraq! In th^second place in the General financialS'6. Having regard to all the circumstances it appears to Lord Passfield that there are good reasons from the point of view of equity, international practice and treaty obligations for contending that the undertakings given to the two Shaikhs are obligations which the Iraq Govern ment are bound to implement and that if the Iraq Government are not prepared to honour these obligations the question should be referred to arbitration under Article 17 of the Treaty of 1922 * 7. There are, however, certain difficulties in the way of arbitration* Article 13 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922 provides that any difference that may arise between the contracting parties as to the interpretation of the provisions of the treaty shall be referred to arbitration and it would there-fore appear that the only question which could be referred to arbitration is the question whether the obligations to the two Shaikhs are covered by the provisions of the Treaty* Having regard to the fact that the obligations to the Shaikhs were not mentioned in the letter dated 26tii March, 19&lt;i4, from the High Commissioner to the Prime Minister of Iraq there would appear to be some difficulty in maintaining that such obligations are covered by Article 10 of the Treaty. Cn the other hand, it seems probable that reliance could be placed on Article 4 of the Treaty* The undertakings to the Shaikhs could, Lord Passfield considers reasonably be described as an important matter affecting the international and financial obligations Oi. His Britannic Majesty, and thus a matter upon which the Iraqi Government are under an obligation to be guided by the advice of His Britannic Majesty tendered through the High Commissioner* It should be mentioned here that Loriit it sH ta ns cl el Ii ut A IK 1c U3 30 ci ni qe nb st idw nit nT [ill I n ?iit ^sH ^oS jit ot -y be recognised by King Faisal as such. In that case neither the Courts nor the authorities of Iraq would have any legal right to make any order for taxation against him, nor to enforce any such order, if made. 9. In these circumstance I am to request that you will be good enough to furnish Lord Passfield with your opinion generally and in particular on the following questions:- (1) Do you agree that it would be advisable if possible to induce the Iraqi Government to agree to a special reference to the Permanent Court of International Justice at the Hague and that such reference should be framed in. the widest possible terms in order to include not only the question whether the Iraqi Government are obliged to continue the exemption from taxation under the terms of the Treaty but also by reason of the financial settlement of 1921 and under the rules of international law? (2) In view of the fact that a definite pronounce ment in confirmation of the view expressed in paragraph 8 above might strengthen the position of His Majesty’s Government vis-a-vis the Iraq Government, do you consider that the reference to the Hague Court should be so i framed as to cover the question whether, in view of the status of the Shaikh of Kuwait as an independent sovereign it would be in accordance with international law and usage that his properties in Iraq should be immune from taxation?

IRAQ. * SECRET . Acting H.Cr, Downing Street. July , 1930. I have the honour to refer to your telegram Ho.436 of the 4th December and to subsequent tele graphic correspondence on the question of the exemption from taxation of the date gardens of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah, on which, after taking legal advice, I am now in a position to address you further, 2. I am advised that it is open to doubt whether the contention put forward in your telegram under reference, that the obligations of His Majesty’s Government to the Shaikhs of Mohammerah and Kuwait are covered by Article 10 of the Anglo- Iraq Treaty of the 10th October,1922, could be maintained, Tt is not suggested that the oblig ations of His Majesty’s Government to the two Shaikhs would not be covered by the general terms of that Article, if the Article stood alone. But I am advised that Article 10 must be construed to gether with Sir H.Dobbs 1 letter to the Iraq Trim© Minister of the 26th March,1924 and the Iraq Prime Minister’s reply of the 10th of July,1924, Sir Henry Dobbs’ letter, which was written for the express purpose of defining the Treaties and agree ments referred to in Article 10, contained nono mention of the obligations to the two Shaikhs, The Iraq Government were subsequently informed, in Mr, Davidson’s letter No,P„0,75 of the 17th of April,1924, that the undertakings to the two Shaikhs were M a minor obligation' to which it was not thought necess ary to allude in the notes exchanged under Article 10, and that 'in view of the difficulties of settling a matter of this kind at the present juncture His Majesty’s Government have decided not to include these obligations to the Shaikhs concerned among the Agree ments covered by Article 10 of the Treaty unless the Iraq Government desires to do so”. In his reply to Sir Henry Dobbs’ letter, the Iraq Prime Minister, while accepting, as covered by Article 10, the Treaties and Agreements set out in that letter, made no reference to Mr*Davidson’s letter of the 17th of April or to the undertakings given to the two Shaikhs, In the circumstances, His Majesty’s Government might find it difficult to establish that these under i-aking-., were covered by Article 10,• U. This does not, however, imply that the Iraq Government are not bound to give effect to the under takings. They were informed of their existence in Mr•Davidson’s letter of the 17th of April,1924, In the Iraq Prime Minister’s reply to Sir henry Doebs* letter of the 26th of March,1924 no exception was taken to them, and as the Iraq Government continued to accord exemption from taxation to the Shaikhs, it was reasonable to assume at that time that the Iraq Government recognised their liability to continue to accord such exemption. It was not until the end of 1925, some two years after the ratification of the 1922 Treaty, that the question was again raised™3» raised 'tey the Iraq Goyernment, who then contended that the exemption hitherto accorded were illegal and could, not be continued, 3* '&gt;t the time of the negotiation of the unratified ^nglo-Iraq Treaty of the 14th December 1927, the Iraq delegates asked for, and were furnished with, a memo randum containing a list of British international obli gations in respect of Iraq, The promises of immunity from taxation given to the two Shaikhs were mentioned in that memorandum, and no objection to its terms was raised by the Iraq delegates during the course of the negotiations. His Majesty’s Government had therefore some ground for assuming that the Iraq Government were prepared to re cognise the obligations to the two Shaikhs, although they had not expressly stated that they were willing to do so, or expressly accepted the memorandum as an accurate statement of British international obligations in respect of Iraq, Indeed it was not until the middle of last year that it again became evident that the Iraq Govern ment were unwilling to honour the obligations to the two Shaikhs, 4. While, therefore, His Majesty’s Government are by no means debarred from claiming that their obligations to the two Shaikhs have devolved upon the Iraq Govern ment under Article 10 of the Treaty, it is open to doubt whether such a claim would succeed before a court of arbitration, Nevertheless, I am advised that His Majesty’s Government should on no account abandon the right to invoke Article 10 should the matter t&gt;e taken to arbitration, and for—that reason it is important that anyany communication that may now he addressed to the Iraq Government should contain no statement which might he construed as an abandonment by His Majesty's Government of the right to rely upon Article 10, or, indeed, which might preclude the use of any argument based upon other articles ofthe Treaty which His Majesty's Government might later wish to adduce before a Court of Arbitration* 5, I am advised that, apart from Article 10, the undertaking to the two Shaikhs could properly be des cribed as an important matter 'affecting the inter- national and financial obligations of His Britannic Majesty' within the meaning of Article 4 of the 1922 Treaty and thus a matter upon which the Iraqi Govern ment are at present under obligation to be guided by the advice of His Britannic Majesty tendered through the High Commissioner, His Majesty’s Govern ment could properly contend, therefore, that, in virtue of that Article, the Iraq Government are bound to honour those undertakings if His Britannic Majesty so advises, 6, Apart, however, from any specific Treaty obligations on the part of the Iraq Government, there are other considerations which in themselves justify the contention of His Majesty's Government that the Iraq Government should honour these obli gations, These might appropriately be brought to the notice of the Iraq Government. In the first place, Iraq was captured from the Turks at great£ rea ^ cost, to the ritish nationj the territory so captured has 'been handed over to the new State of Iraq, and the undertakings given by His Majesty’s Government to the two Shaikhs were only a very small part of the price paid by His Majesty’s Government for victory in Iraq, This consideration was emphasised and endorsed by the Financial Mission to Iraq in paragraph 8 of the Appendix to their Report of the 25th April,1925, ?• In the second place, under the general financial settlement between His Majesty’s Government and Iraq, which was effected as from the 1st April 1921, the Iraq Government took over all the assets of the Civil Administration (with the exception of certain assets derived from military expenditure, vote of credit, or Army Funds), and assumed res ponsibility for all Civil charges in the future, in return for the assumption by His Majesty’s Govern ment of responsibility for the net deficit of the Civil Administration on the 31st March,1921. It is a reasonable contention that the liability to con tinue to accord exemption from taxation to the two Shaikhs, in accordance with the promise made to them on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, was one of the liabilities for which the Iraq Government assumed responsibility in this general settlement. 8. Thirdly, although there is no definite accepted rule of international practice, which- 6 - which autoniatically surrogates a succeeding State to the contracturai rights and obligations of its predecessor, I am advised that modern usage of nations has tended to the acknowledgment of such obligations and it is the generally accepted practic that, on the transfer from one State to another of responsibility for the administration of any terri tory, the State to which the responsibility is transferred should, in the absence of any express provision to the contrary, at the same time take over the contracturai assets and liabilities attach ing to the territory in question. It would appear, therefore, that it could fairly be contended that, when the responsibility for the administration of Iraq passed from His Majesty’s Government to the Iraq Government, the latter Government ipso facto assumed responsibility for continuing the exemption from taxation promised to the two Shaikhs. 9* Having regard to all these considerations it is clear that there are good reasons, from the point of view of equity, international practice and treaty obligation, for contending that the under takings given to the two Shaikhs are obligations which the Iraq Government are bound to implement, nis majesty’s Government have, therefore, decided that, if the Iraq Government are not prepared to honour those obligations, one question at issue should be referred to arbitration* 1C.......-7- 10. A reference to arbitration under Article 17 of the Anglo-I:- a q Treaty of 1922 would, however, be open to the objection that it would necessarily be confined to an interpretation of the provisions of the Treaty and to the question whether the obligations to the two ohaikhs were covered by those provisions* Such a restriction might diminish the chances of success. Therefore, since any unilateral application for arbitration by His Majesty's Government could only be made under Act 17, every effort should be made, if the Iraq Government still refuse to honour the under takings to the two Shaikhs, to induce them to concur in a special reference being made by agreement to the Permanent G 0 urt of International Justice. This reference should be framed in the widest possible terms so as to cover not only the question of the obligations of the Iraq Government under the pro visions of the Treaty of 1922, but also the obligations of the Iraq Government by reason of the financial settlement of 1921 and under the rules of international lav/. It should include also the question whether it is in accordance with International law that the pro perties of the Shaikh of Kuwait should be immune from taxation as a consequence of his status as an independ ent sovereign. (in this connection reference is invited uo paragraph 3 of n$/ Secret despatch of the \ J ^ ^ 4th of November 1929), In order to induce the Iraq Government to- 8 - to consent to the submission of the question to arbitration by special agreement it might be pointed out to them that it would oe knuch more in accordance with their dignity voluntarily to submit the whole question in dispute to the Court in accordance with the procedure which, under the Optional Clause all the great Powers have now undertaken or are about to under take to f ollow in their relations with each other, than to be forced to appear before the Court by unilateral application under Article 17 of the Treaty. 11. It seems possible that, if the Iraq Government realise that His Majesty’s Government are determined, if necessary7 to submit the question unilaterally to arbitration, the^ will agree to honour the undertakings to the two Shaikhs. Whatever the decision of the arbitrator, the Iraq Government could hardly fail to be shown up in an unfavourable light during the course of the arbitral proceedings. They would probably be unwilling that the first case to be referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice in which they were interested should be a case which, whatever the decision, would be bound to reflect discredit upon them. If, however, in spite of these considerations, the Iraq Government refuse either to honour their under takings or'to consent to a special reference to arbi tration upon agreed terms, His Majesty’s Government will have no alternative but to refer the matter to the Court of International Justice under Article 17 of the . As 1 have pointed out above such a Treaty of 1922a reference would necessarily be confined to an inter pretation of the provisions of the Treaty• I am advised, however, that within those limits it should he framed as widely as possible, that is to say with / \ ir reference to the whole Treaty and net with reference to any particular article or articles. I am advised also thst if the matter is referred to arbitration, whether by special agreement or by unilateral appli cation on the part of His Majesty’s Government, there is a reasonable chance of success. 12. Unless you.see strong objection, you should again approach the Iraq Government with the request that they should honour the undertakings given to the two Shaikhs. In so doing you should make such use as you think fit of the arguments outlined above, care being taken, however, to say nothing to the Iraq Government which might prejudice the use of any argu ment that His Majesty’s Government might subsequently see fit to adduce before a Court of Arbitration. Subject to that reservation, I must leave to your discretion the exact manner in which you should invoke the provisions of the 1922 Treaty in support of your arguments, but I am disposed to think that you would find it best to confine any arguments under this head to the general assertion that the obligations to the Shaikhs are undertakings which the Iraq uovernment are bound to implement under the provisions of the 1922 Treaty. You should,at the same time, suggest to the Iraq Government that they should endeavour to effect a' - 10 - a final settlement with tne Shaikh of Mohammerah ky offering him a lump sum in commutation of his claims to exemption from taxation; while in the case of the Shaikh of Kuwait you are in a position to make use of the argument that, in virtue of the Shaikh’s position as an independent foreign sovereign, the Iraq Government have no alternative 'but to accord to him immunity from taxation in respect of his property in Iraq, unless, of course, the Shaikh chooses voluntarily to waive that privilege in return for any compensatory benefits that the Iraq Government may be in a position to offer him. If the Iraq Government are unwilling to accord those exemptions without parliamentary sanction and feel doubtful of their ability to obtain such sanction, their attention might be drawn to the Opinion expressed in the last paragraph of the letter ^ n (3 ; %f f the22m of February, 1927, from Raouf Beg Chadirchi, who, at that time was acting as Iraqi Minister of Justice. ( A copy of that letter was enclosed, with Mr.Bourdillon’s despatch Secret D of the 19th of August,1927}» 13„ You are authorised to inform the Iraq Govern ment at whatever stage you may consider appropriate that, if they persist in their refusal to honour the undertakings to the two Shaikhs, His Majesty’s Govern ment will have no alternative but to claim that matter should be referred to arbitration, and if this threat fails to influence them, you should endeavour to induce the Iraq Government to consent to a special reference to arbitration by agreement. If the Iraq1- Iraq Government are prepared to agree to such a special reference you should communicate with me further with a view to deciding the terms of reference. 14. I take this opportunity to comment on the suggestion in your telegram of the 4th of December that, having regard to International usage, the under taking given to the Shaikh of Kuwait was valueless at the time it was given. Prior to that assurance, however, the Shaikh of Kuwait had not been regarded as an independent ruler hut had ov/ed allegiance to the Sultan of Turkey. It is true that after recognising his independence His Majesty’s Government have been hound to accord to him exemption from taxation in accordance with International usage, hut this would not have been evident to the Shaikh hy the mere declaration that His Majesty’s Government recognised his independece, and it appears possible that the addition of the assurance of exemption from taxation was considered necessary in order to make clear to the Shaikh the full implication of that declaration.

After consideration of your views, and those ol Government of India, whole question has Been further examined by His Majesty’s Government in consolation with Humphrys. As a result they have decided to authorise Iraq Government to negotiate direct with the Sheikhs, while at the same time reserving their decision as to action to he taken should direct negotiations break down. Please take action on the following lines. Yo H. s houia,.JarttaAtha-m^ SheikU of Kuwait? notifying Bafehdad so soon as communication has been made, that Iraq Government propose to negotiate with him privately for a direct settlement of the question of immunity from taxation promised him in respect of his date gardens at Basrah. Settlement contemplated by them would be for purchase of date gardens together with all rights and exemption thereto attached. Sheikh should also be informed that although he would of course be entirely free ' I \ to accept or reject any offer made to frim by Iraq, His '' ' / ' V majesty’s Government consider that he would be well advised to accept a reasonable offer, since sale of his properties to Iraq would not only provide him with a substantial capital sum but would be also removing a source of friction between Iraq and Kuwait, which, if not eliminated now, might seriously prejudice relations between the two States and could hardlytfail to lead to unfortunate consequences. Shaikh should be reminded that i\ Iraqcontrol after 1932. If Sheikh enquires what is attitude of His i ajesty *s Governinent in regard to undertaking given on their behalf in 1914 to his predecessor he should be informed that that undertaking is regarded 'by His Majesty's Government as a valid and oinding obligation but that in their view this obligation has now devolved upon Iraq Government* The Iraq Government however do not accept this view, but rather that come into open conflict on the point with His Majesty’s Govermajent, are prepared, without prejudice to question of principle involved, to attempt to reach a settlement of the issue on the oasis of a reasonable composition and in all the circumstances His Majesty’s Government consider this method will offer most hopeful prospect of settling matter in best interest of all concerned. If Sheikh should then ask what will happen if he is unable to settle with Iraq as regards purchase price of bis properties and direct negotiations therefore break down, he should be informed that matter would then fall to be dealt with between His Majesty’s Government and Iraq Governemnt. His ajesty’s Government would do their utmost to obtain formal exeepta ce of this obligation by Iraq. If their efforts were successful and Iraq were forced to accept obligation as devolving upon themselves it seems alniost certain that they would wish to compound their liability to Sheikh in much the same manner as is now proposed. It seems doubtful in such event whether Sheikh would on balance obtain terms anymore generous than those which are likely to he offered to him now since the atmosphere in which the negotiations would then be conducted could scarcely fail to be less favourable than it is now, when Iraq Government fcjre anxious to please His .ajesty’s Government by disposing of a question at issue between the two governments.governments. If in the course of direct negotiations l between Sheikh and Iraq. Government the former should seek the advice of the Political Agent, Kuwait, in regard to any specific offer put forward by Iraq, Political Agent should reply that Sheikh is himself best able to judge whether the terms offered by Iraq are or are not accept- -able, and that he is uhaole to advise on this point. Political Agent should, while not informing Sheikh that he is doing sj, acquaint i.is Majesty’s Government with terms of Iraq offer as disclosed to him by Gheikh. If that offer then appears to His fajesty's Government as wholly unreasonable it would he for consideration whether high Commissioner for Iraq should not be instructed to Intervene privately with Iraq Government with the object of inducing them to offer better terms. But no hint of posaibilitjr of such intervention should of course be conveyed to Sheikh.

(This was told him by the Qaimakam Shatt al-Arab). Ue iaUghill8ly said tha 't 'little' Kuwait had had many and similar cries with -t-v,„ m •, i 03 Wlth the Turks over the selfsame properties and had survived them all. m those days the Turks had objected to Shaikh Mubarak owning such huge estates because they suspected he was in league with the English and was out to acquire the Shatt al-Arab delta and eventually Basrah for them. I I Mubarak had stood no nonsense and threatened the Turks that if his gardens or fellahs were interfered with in any way, he would attack Basrah (he of course- paid revenue) and cvould certainly send armed forces by dhow to occupy and defend his properties against Turkish ^SS^ession. - 6 * Similarly today the ,/azir added, if it really came to tne point, Kuwait would fight, and would send armed xorces to Kao to defend her rights. Also before she would give up uhese rights she would call in Bin Saud T s aid and let his Bedouin loose against Basrah. He smilingly added that he personally could not visualize such a thing happen ing, seeing that they had H.M.Government T s plighted word behind them, but for the sake of argument, supposing Great Britain did break her promises, it must not be thought that the people of Kuwait would take things lying down. 7. I mention the above significant conversation as illustrating how strongly the ordinary Kuwaiti citizen thinks about this subject. S. Thinking the #azir T s conversation might have been inspired bluff, I went and saw the Shaikh and asked if he had said anything to his official of the coming negotia tions. The Shaikh stoutly denied having done so and begged me to believe that he had not breathed the matter toa single person yet. It was far too risky for him to do so he said. 9. In the meantime there has been no sign from f Iraq yet.One very interesting thing which the ^7azir stated, was ttat (according to the Qaimakam of the Shatt al-Arab) the 'Iraq. Governraent strongly objected to the Fao properties being registered all in the name of the Shaikhs of rniwait, when they knew that actually many owners had snares (170 about). They were therefore determined to try ann break up the properties and get each owner to register his portion in his or her name. me i .7azir saw in this a deep game to gradually force owners to accept T Iraq nationality (by persecution etc.) I mysell see in it the fact that T Iraq quite recognizes tnat they are pov/erless, so long as the property remains in the name of the Ruler of Kuwait, and that they are quite aware of the fact that under international law, and inde pendent sovereigns estates cannot be taxed.

Respects k Compliments, In compliance with Your Excellency’s orders I met Shaikh Salih Bash A 1 yan, and proceeded to Kuwait at once, as I was holding a permanent passport while Shaikh Salih Bash A’yan had to wait two days Before a passport could be prepared for him. At first I offered your compliments and sincere wishes to H,B, Shaikh Ahmad a 1-Jabir, ameer of Kuwait, then I have him the message which I had received for His Excellency, and tried to arrive at a satisfactory solution as to His Excellency paying revenue on Ms ties in ’Iraq. I did my best to bring this question to an end in a way that would keep continuous friendship and brotherhood between the two counrries. His Excellency asked me to convey to your Excellency the respects and affection which he bears to your honourable person, also his best wishes for Your Excellency's success in your praiseworthy efforts and for the welfare of the be loved 'Iraq. He^ saia however that he could not decide this oat tar for two reasons: firstly, because the properties did not belong to himself only, but belonged to all the heirs of his late grandfather Shaikh hubarak Pasha as-Sabah, therefore he could not discuss the question of their taxation except after taking the opinion of the adult heirs. Secondly, that the British Government had promised his late grand father Shaikh Mubarak Pasha as-Sabah solemnly to exempt all his properties in ’Iraq from revenue taxation. Phis premise was given as a result of some political arrangement which was come to between the British Government and his above9 7.MM abovementioned grandfather, and in accordance with certain promises and agreements which had taken p^ace between them, and therefore the matter was a diplomatic rather than iinancial one. huch being the case, it was impossible for him to agree to any request (for payment of taxes), and he asked that the matter should be referred to the men of the British Government• In conclusion I thank Your YxcelXency cop the confidence you have so kindly placed in me, which has given me honour and esteem, I am always prepared to comply with any order of yours which X may be able to perform.

This, the Sheikh said, was con trary to the written undertaking given to him hy Sir P.Cox during the war, in virtue of which his date groves were exempted from all taxes as a reward for the services which the Sheikh had rendered. 2. I have noticed in the Bev/s Diaries from Baghdad that this question has in the past occupied the attention of the 1 Iraq Cabinet and that certain proposals in con nexion therewith had been discussed but I am unaware that any definite decision has been taken*. In any case the Sheikh evidently expects the terms of the document given to him to be implemented whatever the future status of ^raq may be and looks to His Majesty’s Government to see that the made to him by the then High Commissioner will continue to be carried out. 3. I beg that I may be informed in due course What reply 1 to give to the Sheikh. I should be glad to allay his fears as the rent of his properties at Basrah, after deducting the expenses for the maintenance of his numerous family and dependents in ’Iraq, is all that he has to live on at present and he is naturally anxious to avoid any reduction in these revenues at this stage.f 4* I am Bending a copy of tins despatch to His Hajeaty 1 s Acting High Commissioner at Baghdad.

My Lord, I have the honour to refer to Your Lordship’s despatch Secret B dated the 3rd of October,1930, on the subject of the date gardens in ’Iraq belonging to the Shaikh of Moharamerah. 2. No action has been taken, as far as I am able to ascertain, by the ’Iraq Government to enter into direct negotiations with the Shaikh of Mohammerah, who is in Teheran, for the purchase of his properties in ’Iraq.

I think it unlikely that any approach will be made to the Shaikh of Mohammerah for the present, and I see no objection to the proposal contained in the letter from the Foreign Office, which accompanies Your Lordship’s despatch under reply, to the effect that no further action should for the present be taken by His Majesty’s Minister at Tehexan# 3.

He recognises, however, that some little time appears likely to elapse before a critical stage can be reached in the negotiations between Koweit and Iraq, and he agrees with Mr. Secretary Henderson that the course of any negotiations which may eventually take place between the Iraqi Govermerit and the Sheikh of Mohammerah will necessarily depend upon the prospect of a settlement with the Sheikh of Koweit. In these circumstances, he concurs generally, subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in the tenour of the instructions proposed to be sent to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran.

In particular, the correspondence concerns the Government of Iraq's intention to end the immunity from taxation (on the gardens) that had been granted to the former ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Mubārak Āl Ṣabāḥ, and the Shaikh of Mohammerah by the British Government in return for their military support against the Ottoman Empire in the First World War. The volume contains letters (ff 16-20), dated November 1914, from the British Resident and Consulate-General, Bushire, Persian Gulf, to both shaikhs in respect to this issue. The volume also contains correspondence between British officials discussing the British Government's obligations to Kuwait and how it should react to the Government of Iraq's plans.The Iraq Government had considered and continues to consider that the exemption from taxation is illegal. This issue was discussed in an extract of an article that appeared in
                           Al-Iraqnewspaper and published in 1927, in which the writer gives the exact amount (12.000 Turkish gold liras per year, or 100.000 in the past 7 years) Iraq was losing annually as a result of the exemption from taxes granted to the two shaikhs.The British officials had direct correspondence with the Council of Ministers, Iraq.
