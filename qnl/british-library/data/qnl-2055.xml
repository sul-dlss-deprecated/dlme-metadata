In conversation with Sheikh Isa^ the question of Sheikh Khalifah bin Hamad's intrigues was mentioned. The Sheikh said that as his cousin derived no benefit at all from his previous intrigues with the Tiir&gt;*s, he did not think that the present intrigues amounted to much. He was keeping an eye on Sheikh Fhalif ah. (b)* As the Political Agent had heard that Sheikh Ali bin iUuned had been severely beating a Bahrein! at Bosaiba, he yH took the opportunity to mention the matter to the Sheikh and suggest to him the advisability of nipping the matter in the bud, as if Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed found he could do such things with impunity, there vma no knowing where he would stop, and perhaps it might end in a repetition of the 1904 business which would be most undesirable# Sheikh Isa agreed and said that he had already taken steps to make Sheikh Ali desist from such actions. He would s^e that Sheikh Ali did not do such things. MISQELLANK0U3. 103.

Abdul Karim's period of the landing contract having expired on 8th instant, the Sheikh entrusted the work to Seth Maharaj, Director of Customs, assisted by Ali bin Abdullah of Muharraq. The former will do th© shore work, while the latter has been made responsible for supplying boats. This arrangement will work until final orders as bO proposed alternative arrangements are received from the Go vernment of India and the Resident. Some half a dozen Hindu clerks have been imported from India to work under Maharaj and at present matters look rather promising. (KATR). 109. Reference para 89, Sheikh Jasim wishing to make the position of his son Abdullah more secure as Governor of Doha for the future, and fearing T&amp;p&amp;kl at the hands of Sheikh Ahmed bin Thani and his friends (to whom a reference was mad© in weekly diary Ho. 12 - para 91), callan a Majlis of notablesnotables and asked thera to take an oath of allsgiance to the new governor# Sheikh Ahmed and aone others refused to do so and began to discuss whereupon Sheikh Jasim left the Majlis, QUSTOYS« (HASA &amp; KATIP). 110, Yaooob Sffendi, Turkish Customs Official (vide para 59) returned to Bahrein on 9th April 1913 after having mad© his inspection of the Darin and Katif Customs accounts. He is put ting up with Yusuf Fanoo and will shortly be leaving for Ojair and Hasa for the same purpose. He found the revenue far below previous years* figures not withstanding the enhanced rate of duty viz 11^ being charged now in place of that of 8% formerly. The traffic has by no means decreased but the present Mudira apparently are not honest j men. The Inspector found feat the Mudir at Darin harfintf: recent ly pocketed some T£ 12 over 3 boats of merchandise and made him disgorge the amount. At Katif, the total receipts during the last year, he told Yusuf Kanoo, had amounted to T£ 2100 with an expenditure of T£ 700 to set off. During the year previous, the figure was T£ 2400, but when the duty was only 8^ and the Customs was farmed out, it usually fetched Tfi 4000 annually and the farmer had besides to spend almost an ec[ual amount in bribery to secure the lease. This points to very considerable peculation on the part of the local Customs officials. ARRIVALS &amp; DEPARTURES OF STEALERS. 111. S.S.

The produce is appropriated by the divers themselves with no share for the Nakhudas. Some Nakhudas of different tribes resident in Bahrein object to this concession being granted to the divers at the beginning of the season as it tends to make the diver less enthusiastic for work in pearling season proper, for which reason they allow a like trip In the end only* The Dosiris have not allowed their divers to go. / K . r/Zt c I . tffc-Jor, Political B A H R E I HQUARANTINE.

Sheikh Isa bin Ali Al Khalifa has appointed two headmen one over donkeys and the other over coolies with instructions to sunply him with either donkeys or coolies whenever he re quires them and to see that their legitimate hires are paid. It appears that recently a case came to the personal knowledge of the Sheikh in which a coolie who fetched water from a boat to his house was not paid his hire and this has led him to make the above arrangements. This seems to be a step in the right direction &gt;iii'oafaion towards the suppression of 'S&amp;khra' (forced labour). NEJD . 413 .
