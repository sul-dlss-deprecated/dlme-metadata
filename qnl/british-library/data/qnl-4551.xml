Special Authorisation for aircraft to land in and fly over the territory of the Shaikh^ which were circulated by the Air Ministry should be discussed seriatiim. on the 1st May, Air Navigation Regulations . Mr. Laithwaite emphasised that the Air navigation Regulations should be the Shaikh’s Regulations (issued on the advice and with the consent of His Majesty’s Government). * . . The Jndia Office contemplated that when the Regulations had been issued over the signature of the Shaikh they should posted/“ . 2 . posted up (in English and Arabic) at the aerodrome; that a copy should be appended to authorisations to fly over and land in the Sheikh’s territory; that the Air Ministry should publish them in Notices to Airmen; and that a copy should be sent to the Passport Office; khact and that if and when the Arabian Coast route was opened to private fliers a copy of the regulations should be sent to the I.C.A.U. n Mr. Johnstone thought that in view of the somewhat tangled situation as regards the relations between His Majesty’s Government and the Shaikh vis-a-vis the I.C.A.N. it was desirable,to avoid any mention of the Convention^in published regulations (the reference appears in Clause 8} Mr.Laithwaite pointed out, however, that the regulations were the Shaikh’s regulations; he was not a party to the Convention but he was nevertheless at liberty to apply any part of it in his territory. On the question of Quarantine, Captain Prior said that State regulations at Bahrain were very strict, tfhen there was an outbreak of plague at Basrah, Srd-class passengers on steamers were not allowed to land at Bahrain at all. Colonel Fowle said that he did not see why there should be any difficulty so far as ’’through” passengers on aircraft were concerned, if they were not allowed outside the aerodrome or rest house. He said he would mention the question of quarantine when at Bahrain, and no difficulty need be anticipated in fixing things up satisfactorily. Mr. Laithwaite said that Clause 15 of the Draft Regulations raised the question of the legal position of the political agents. Under an Order in Council, all foreigners at Bahrain were under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent and, as all fliers would be foreigners, it would be for the &gt; and not the Shaikh, to deal with contraventione Un ??T an P rde r ^ Council in contlmpl^ tion for Kuwait, the position there would be the same. v There is not at present an Order in Council applicable to ohargah. ihe position of Shargah might require further consideration. One method of dealing with the Trucial area would be an Order in Council for the Trucial Coast, but it seemed probable that there might be some difficulty about ihe matter would be taken up separately by the India n ?° f ? r . &amp;8 Muscat territory is concerned the political Agent has power only over British subjects, infringements of the regulations in Muscat territory by foreigners would be a matter for the Sultan. Cept. Prior raised the question of Accident regulations and mentioned the $ responsibilities of the Political Agent in the case of shipping, /.fter discussion it was agreed to omit reference to accidents as the regulations were to be confined to matters concerning the Shaikh. If an accident to a British aircraft occurred in the Shaikh’s territory, the Air Ministry would arrange for it to be investigated if necessary(probably by the Government of India on Air Ministry behalf as in the case of an accident to an Imperial Airway's* aircraft at Jask some time ago). &lt; . ' rh ® D ^ 8ft Regulations were agreed, subject to amendments in the Heading, Clauses 1, 6, 15 (iii) and 16, the omission of sir-uses 13 and 14, and the insertion after Clause 11 of a new clause relating to passports. The/3- The revised regulations sre set out in attachment 'A* hereto. 2. Heads of Agreement between His Majesty*s Government a nd the Shaikh l Mr. Bertram stated that the i\oy&amp;X Air Force had put forward some proposed amendments affecting Clauses 1 to 7, and also proposed an additional clause (ao.20;. Mr* Laithwaite stated that the India Office had no very substantial criticism of the Air Ministry draft on the matters of substance; but the India Office feeling (as expressed on previous occasions and he thought shared by the Foreign if ice,' was that it was desirable to emphasise the importance of the Shaikh’s position, and so far as possible, while retaining the real control ourselves on all points of importance, to operate behind the facade of the local ruler concerned. He would therefore propose a number of verbal alterations. As regards military aircraft; it was recommended that Clause o should be deleted and that the position of military the local ruler and His Majesty’s Government prior to, or concurrently with, the signature of the agreements. it was thf dr»ft h tn A ^ “r n ^ 8tr ^B 0 draft a 8uitable letter and forward the draft to the India Office and the Foreign Office. It was also suggested that all reference to 'allies of His Britannie M^jeety^ and to 'war' should be avoided. fling ComSnder wi ?^ ed , it t0 be understood that he did not commit y lc ?v si £ e t ? aooe P tin e the deletion of Clause 3 (as corded in the i.oyal Air Force amendment referred to above,'. i + &gt; ^ rVic f ^euhaient to Clause 4 was not adopted, the eeBoJ i r i i n I) fh^ rta h n rf S 1 ta * in fv. the View that the amended form e„ out m the schedule to these minutes was es far as it said n thn?

As to the additional clause (20) suggested by the Service side, Colonel Fowle pointed out that all foreigners had the right to protection and there is no doubt that the Shaikh is responsible for providing such protection. It was considered that the position would be strengthened by omitting this clause. Wing Commander McClaughry, however, thought that each case should be treated on its merits - at Bahrain the question did not arise; at Kuwait it might arise; afad at Shergah it definitely did arise. ( Hote l in any case the agreement under discussion will not apply to Shargah at present)* Subject to Wing Commander lic^laughry’s reservations, the Heads of agreement in accordance with attachment 'B' hereto were agreed. 3• Conditions governing the Use of Aerodromes . These conditions were agreed in the terms of attach ment M C rt hereto, amendments having been made in the heading Clause 1 of the Air Ministry Draft, and clauses 5, 6, 7, and 10 of that draft omitted. (Clause 10 to be covered if necessary under the exchange of letters referred to at 2. above. 4. Special authorisation for Aircraft to land in and fly over the Territory of the Shaikh . Wing Commander McClaughry pressed for the inclusion of a condition prescribing the route to be followed. Mr. Dibdin doubted whether any one Shaikh could influence the route. Mr. Laithv/aite pointed out that the power of a Shaikh to prescribe the route ended with the boundary of his territorial waters. On the other hand, it would be open to His Majesty’s Government ( and they had in fact adopted this course in the communications to the French and Dutch Governments) to indicate that having regard to the special conditions in this area and the special responsibilities falling upon His Majesty’s Government we must require them as a condition of the grant of facilities along the Arab Air Route to fly a prescribed route. So far as Imperial Airways and other British units were concerned the necessary pressure in the same sense would presumably be brought to bear without difficulty by the Air Ministry.

WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 9th June 1933. Sir In reply to your letter Ho.S.31992/S.6 dated 15th May, I am directed hy the Secretary of State for India to say that he entirely shares the view of the Air Council as to the importance of safeguarding strategic requirements in connection with the Arab Air. Route, and that he has carefully considered the questions raised by the Air Council in the light of the recent interdepartmental discussions. 2. Sir Samuel Hoare remains of opinion that on general grounds it would be preferable to emit any reference to strategic requirements from the actual agreements to be concluded between His Majesty’s Government and the local rulers of the Persian Gulf, and agrees with the view put forward at the inter departmental meeting, and shared, he understands, by Lieutenant Colonel Fowle, that in so far as those requirements are not already covered and it is consequently necessary to provide for them specifically, this can best be done by letters to be exchanged between the Political Resident and the Sheikhs, the terms of which could, if necessary, be kept confidential. If the Air Council are prepared to accept this view in the light of the examination of the specific points raised by them contained in the following paragraphs, he would suggest that the actual terms of the communication to be made to the rulers in question should be discussed informally between/ The Secretary, Air Ministry, W.C. 2.between the interested departments with a view to reaching agreement. 3. In the Secretary of State’s view the only point which it should be necessary to cover in an exchange of letters such as is suggested in the preceding paragraph is that set out in paragraph 2(a) of the Air Council letter under reply. 4. As regards the point discussed in para.2(b) of that letter, the Air navigation Regulations and connected documents if approved in the form in which they emerged from the recent interdepartmental discussion will, in the first place, preclude any aircraft, whether British or foreign, from flying over or landing in the territory of the Arab Sheikhs of the Persian Gulf save under a special authorisation issued by the ruler of the territory concerned. Secondly, exclusive rights for the establishment and maintenance of aerodromes are vested by the documents in question in His Majesty’s Government, who are further precluded from granting without the consent of the Sheikh the use of the aerodrome or aerodromes to foreign aircraft. Thirdly, the Arao rulers of the Gulf (save in the case of Muscat)'are precluded by their treaty engagements from having any negotiations with or receiving the representative of any power other than the British Government, and in the case of Muscat it should be possible in the Secretary of State’s view to secure without much difficulty that no such negotiations take place. The Secretary of State, in the light of all these circumstances, is satisfied that it will in practice be possible to secure the desiderata of the Air Council' 3. without any specific agreement on the point 'between them and the ruler concerned. Moreover, on general political grounds he would be averse to urging the local rulers to accept a. specific stipulation of this nature, as the effect of doing so may be to leave on them the impression that they are making a concession of substantial importance in return for which they would be entitled to expect sane equally substantial qu id pro quo . 5. No difficulty ought, in Sir Samuel Hoare’s view, to arise in regard to point 2 (c). (The power of the local ruler to govern the route to be followed by aircraft using the Arab Air Route is of course clearly limited to his own territories and territorial waters.) As regards foreign aircraft it will be remembered that in the correspondence which recently took place with the French and the Dutch Governments, His Majesty’s Government specifically required a formal assurance that in the event of the grant of facilities on the Arab oute by the local rulers concerned, air liners belonging to companies of the countries in question should undertake to fly a prescribed route and to comply with any suggestions they might receive from British political officers in the Persian Gulf. Subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Samuel Hoare considers that this question should continue to be dealt with on the same lines and that His Majesty’s Government, in view of their special treaty relations with the Arab rulers of the Gulf, their political position in the Gulf area., and the indirect liability which they assume for protection, etc. of aircraft permitted to fly the Arab Route should continue to make a corresponding stipulation in connection with/with future applications of the same nature. In the case of British air companies and pilots the pressure requisite to ensure the flying of a specified route could no doubt without difficulty be applied by the Air Ministry. It seems in any case unnecessary to cover this point in any specific agreement with Arab rulers since, as pointed out above, no ruler can in fact exercise any influence on the route to be followed save over his own State or territorial waters. But the fact that the special authorisations of the Sheikhs concerned and facilities at the various aerodromes can be withheld on future occasions from offending aircraft seems a sufficient deterrent against serious contravention of prescriptions given in regard to r oute. 6. The question referred to in paragraph 2(d) of your letter was discussed in considerable detail at the meeting at the Air Ministry on 5th May, at which the Secretary of State notes that Lieut.Colonel Bowie, whose advice must necessarily carry great weight, was of opinion that it would be preferable to make no specific provision for the point. The Secretary of State entirely shares this view. In his opinion it would be better to regard the liability for protection as a duty autcmatically falling on the local ruler concerned (subject, possibly, if for any reason protection - as at present in the case of Shargah - were likely to involve the provision of special police or the like, to a readiness to make some financial contribution to cover unusual expenditure by the ruler). If and when public aerodromes are opened at places/5 . places such as Shinas or Kalba, where the problem of protection may be thought to present special features, special provision can, if necessary, be made in the agreement with the Sheikh, if the circumstances at the time are thought to render this desirable. But it will not be overlooked that a specific demand for such an assurance is far from unlikely to produce a counter demand for an additional subsidy or, (as was recently exemplified in the case of the Sheikh of Qatar) for a political assurance of a kind which it might be most undesirable to give, and in Sir Samuel Hoare's view it will be best not to raise the question specifically, but to let it be knov/n (as has already been done both in the case of Qatar and Kalba) that the local rulers will be expected to give good treatment to aeroplanes which may be obliged to land in their territories and that any failure on their part to secure the safety and interests of aircraft will result in the application of sanctions by His Majesty^ Government. 7. The Secretary of State trusts that in the light of the explanation given above the Air Council will agree that, save for the point referred to in paragraph 2(a) of their letter under reply, specific provision need not be made, in the arrangements with the Arab rulers of the Persian Gulf, for the matters discussed in paragraph 2 of that letter. 8.

Yours sincerely, C.halrymple Belgrave Ksquire, Adviser, Bahrain Government, Bahrain.D.O/C- © Bahrain, July 10, 1933, Secretariat Dear Colonel Loch, / i/C-255 PC - 7 With reference to your letter D.O/C-255 of 8th July, enclosing draft regarding aerodromes. Page 62, para 11. Until now the State has provided a police guard for every aeroplane landing on the aerodrome. This, at times, has been difficult and inconvenient, I presume that when the new agreement comes into force the comnanies will make their own arrangements. 4 Page 62, para 10. I suggest that, as in Ceylon, this government should have the right to prohibit the landing of aircraft in Bahrain from places where yellow fever is prevalent. Page 64,:15. 'Customs or other duties' I think the meaning of this sentence should be more clearly defined. Presuming that the specified imports are free from customs duty I think it is reasonable to expect that they will pay charges such as Hamali and Import Yard fees. The first of these is an out of pocket expense incurred the State in moving cargo, A the second can be described as rent for use of space in customs sheds. There is also a Baladiya tax which is collected by the Customs. I suppose all0 - 2 - all imports will be imported in the usual way with the usual documents through the Customs. I think any deviation from this course would be unwise. The Bahrain Petroleum Company who also enjoy freedom from customs duty import all goods in the usual way and have never been allowed to make special arrange ments for landing goods elsewhere except through the customs. Page 64, : para 16. I suggest £500.sterling, to be paid in London to the Bahrain Government account, Eastern Bank. Page 66: para 2. I suggest that the sale of liquor in or from aeroplanes while using the aerodrome should be forbidden. Most of the other conditions and regulations are the same as those mentioned by the Company in previous correspondence. Yours sincerely Lieut.

As regards points (b) and (d), the Council assume that any instructions which ;Jir Samuel Hoare may consider to be necessary in this connection will be issuea to the Political Resident. the Council agree that it should form the subject of an exchange of letters between the Political Resident and the Sheikhs, and that the actual terms of the communication to be made to the rulers in question should be discussed informally between the interested Departments. Navigation Regulations and to state that, as regards the Trucial Coast, the Air Council understand that the question of the issue of an Order in Council regarding the jurisdiction of the political authority will receive the separate consideration of the Secretary of State.

ICy dear Bertram, Many thanks for your letter of 13th July, K 0 .248985/33/ C.A.l, We have made the necessary anendment in clause 1 of document C. As you will have seen from Foreign Office letter of 30tji June, N 0 .3382/11/91, they concur in the various ? k ' k h documents concerning the control of civil aviation on the Arab Air ^oute in the tenns in which they were circulated under my letter of 19th May. In view of this we were preparing instructions to l^ie Desident \dien the demi-official letter of TT °; 65 f‘^ a T ed 13th \ 1,111 ^ 1 2 3 an extract June 1933, Deceived 3rd July, ) , ^ arrived from Fowle. ?• 2. v e see no objection to the addition in Document B of a new clause 15(a) in the terms suggested by Eowle. 3. '^he proposed addition to clause ? of Document B is rather more difficult. Hiere is clearly much force in the arguments put forward by the Resident and Dickson. 0 n the other hand we have, as you will remember, throughout been very anxious on general grounds to operate so far as possible rsehird the facade of the Shaikhs and to avoid any possibility of friction between Airways as the agents of His Majesty’s Government 831(1 forei sn air companies, etc. Moreover, we were anxious to reduce contacts between Airways and the local rulers to a minimum, and to keep arrangements so far as possible in the/ 'F.G.L. Bert ram, Esq.,C.B.E., Air Ministry, Owydyr House, Whitehall,S.W.l,the hands of the local political authorities on the one hand, and the Shaikh on the other* !?or these reasons we should, I think, have preferred on the whole to have left the draft as it stands on this point and see how things went in practice, our assumption being that our position in the various S+ates would in ordinary circumstances he such as t o enable us to deal effectively with obstruction on the part of minor State officials. If responsibility for the supervision of the aerodromes (save asjregards customs, quarantine, police and passports) is vested in Imperial Airways as the agents appoint ed' for this purpose by His Majesty’s Oovernment under the terms of an agreement with the Shaikh, the risks of friction with foreign companies the responsibility for which will fall upon His Majesty’s Government, seem likely to be greater. On the y other hand certain of the supervisory functions under document A (checking of licences, logbooks, etc., compliance with requirements of certificate of airworthiness, compliance with rules as to lights and signals and rules for air traffic) can clearly most satisfactorily be discharged onljr by a relative^ expert agency. 4. On the whole, then, in the light of the above considerations and of the views of the Resident and Dickson, we should be prepared, subject to ary views expressed by Foreign Office or Air Ministry, to accept Fnwle’s proposal, subject possibly to the insertion in the dra^t addition pro posed by him after the word ’’supervision” of the words H in respect of such aerodrome or aerodromes, ” ( on the understand ing, of course, that, as suggested by him, passport, customs and medical arrangements should remain wholly in the hands of the Shaikh’s passport and customs of-^icials and of the Quarantine Medical Officer respectively and that police resp on si bi 1 i t y/responsibility would equally vest wholly with the State)* ^ ft? 5. As regards Towle’s note on clause 10, we have, I think, always recognised that there must he slight variations in the form of these agreements to meet local circumstances. But by way of maintaining the principle, if not the practice, of quarantine control, it would, I think, be better to retain the Quarantine Clause in the Agreement with Muscat in respect of Owadur, even if in present conditions clause 10 is a dead letter so far as Owadur is concerned. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to Warner and to Peirse. We should be most grateful if you could let us have your views as early as possible, (I fear pressure of other work here has already involved some delay in dealing with Powle’s points), since it is now becoming quite urgent to dispose of these questions of procedure, which are to some extent holding up action on the Butch request for facilities on the Arab route. Could you in this connection let me have the particulars to be printed as the first Schedule to Document C ? We should also he glad to have ( at any rate in the case of Bahrain and possibly Gwadur, which are alone of immediate importance ) the particulars for insertion in the Second Schedule to the same document, so that comprehensive instructions can be sent to the Besident.

My dear Warner, You ^ill remember that it has been agreed in corres pondence between the India Office and the Air Ministry, copies of which have gone to the foreign Office, that it would be desirable to make specific provision to secure that military aircraft in the service of His Britannic Majesty shall at all times enjoy priority in the use of civil aerodromes and of all facilities without specific prior permission, and free of charge; and that this point could best be covered by letters to be exchanged between the Political Resident and the Shaikhs concerned, the terns of which could, if necessary, be kept confidential. 2. I now enclose a draft of instructions to the Political Resident in the terms of which the Air Ministry concur. Would you be so kind as t o let me lenow whether foreign Office have any observations on it? It woikld, of course, issue simultaneously with a letter on the general question o^ procedure as regards agreements to govern the use, etc. of civil aerodromes etc. on the Arab route. 3.

As will be seen from the correspondence in question, there is now general agreement, in the light of discussions with Lieutenant Colonel Few le, among the interested Departments of His Majesty T s Government as to the advantage of adopting a uniform procedure in dealing with the provision of air facilities in the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf. Agreement has also been reached as to the general * basis of such a procedure. The broad features of the procedure proposed are that the Arab rulers concerned should be advised to make air navigation regulations of their own in terms drafted by His Majesty’s Government; to issue a special authorisation in respect of/ The Fo/eign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla.of aircraft permitted to fly over and land in their territories; to lay down in terns to be approved by Government conditions to govern the use of their aerodromes; and finally to enter into agreements with His Majesty’s Government under which His Majesty’s Government shall have exclusive rights, subject to certain conditions, to establish and maintain, as the agents of the Sheikh concerned, and subject to the terms of the air navigation regulations, etc. referred to above, an aerodrome or aerodromes and ancillary services within the ruler’s territory, and to charge and retain fees in respect of the use of such aerodromes and such ancillary services. As v/ill be seen, the broad principle underlying the proposed new procedure is that, while full control should in fact rest in the hands of His Majesty’s Government, it should, so far as possible, appear to rest with the local ruler. 3 . I am now to enclose copies of (1) Air navigation regulations for civil aircraft- to be made by the local ruler concerned. (2) Draft heads of agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh (Sultan) of the principality concerned; ( 3 ) Conditions to be laid down with the approval of the Ruler to govern the use of the aerodrom^; ( 4 ) Draft special authorisation, for issue by the Ruler, for aircraft to fly over and land in the territory #f the local ruler concerned. The second schedule to the Third Document referred to above is still under consideration by Imperial Airways. Every effort will be made to obtain with the minimum of delay the information required, but it is thought undesirable any longer to postpone a communication on the general question for this reason.4 - I am to request that, if no objection is seen, the Political Heeident in the Persian Gulf may now be instructed to secure the consent of the | SheiJrh of Bahrein, the Sheikh of Koweit and (in I respect of Gwadur) the Sultan of Muscat to the ’ adoption of a procedure of the nature suggested and to the completion of agreements in the terms of the drafts which have been agreed. Shargah is already covered by a separate agreement which will not expire until 1942. Minor facilities such as emergency landing grounds in States other than those referred to above can best be dealt with separately on terms to be approved in the light of the special circumstances of each case. 5 .

Office of the . f i OI- \LGU6 Office of the Adviser to of-4352 Dated, Dil Qaacl 19, 1352 March 5, 1934. the Government, Bahrain From The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, To His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, &gt; refer to your letter i - , , y 25,1934, enclosing a draft agreement between His Majesty's Govern ment and His Excellency Shaikh Hamad. 2. His Excellency has considered the matter and after discussing it with you he has instructed me to acquaint you with the following facts. 3. His Excellency assumes that the exemp tion from Customs or other duties on petrol and oil referred to in paragraph 15 applies only to petrol and oil imported for the use of civil aviation aircraft using the Maharaq aerodrome. 4. The approximate amount now obtained by this government from customs dues on petrol Bahrain Bahrainand oil used by the Imperial Airways during one year is £125. The calculation resulting in this amount is based upon the present rate of Customs duties and the present invoice price of petrol. It now appears however that the Anglo Persian Oil Company, who supply the petrol, are declaring the value of the petrol at a sum very considerably less than the local sale price. If the customs duty was charged according to the local price the total duty on the petrol imported for the use of the Imperial Airways would be about £350. per annum. The question of the invoice value is now under discussion* 5* His Excellency Shaikh Hamad wishes to suggest that the agreement for the Maharaq aerodrome should be upon similar lines to the Manamah aerodrome agreement. He would prefer to receive a somewhat lower rental such as £375. per annum, and to charge the present rate of customs duty on petrol and oil which is imported for the users of the aerodrome. He agrees to exempt from customs and other duties all aircraft, spare parts, aero engines and parts, wireless and direction finding apparatus for the wireless and direction finding station and spare parts therefor. 6 . In connection with this matter His Excellency has instructed me to bring to your notice the fact that for the last eighteen months a guard of the State Police has been provided —provided on the aerodrome on every occasion when Imperial Airways machines or other machines have landed or left the aerodrome. It has been necessary to make special arrange ments to ensure the police being available for this duty and to transport them from Maharaq or Hedd. His Excellency enquires whether^ if the need for this police guard exists, the Imperial Airways Company are prepared to make a definite monthly payment towards the expense of arranging for such a guard. 7* It was agreed by the Imperial Airways Company some eighteen months ago that the pay ment for the Maharaq aerodrome, if used by them, should be retrospective and in the expectancy of this an amount was allowed for in the State Budget, included under revenue from government lands, which the government expected to receive. It is now the eleventh month of the Arabic year, the revenue of the State is less than the expenditure, and no payment has been received from the Imperial Airways Company. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Adviser to the GovernmentBahrain, March 5, 1934. •++. ,0/ll42 / Dear Colonel Loch, . f &gt; Reference my letter regarding duty etc. on petrol used by the Imperial Airways: Russell tells me that the Airways machines on the average consume 725 gallons a week. I enclose herewith a note showing how I have calculated the duty. Yours sincerely, Lieut-Colonel G. Loch, I.A., H. B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain.sn Re: Petrol, According to Mr. Russell f s letter, the I.A.machines consume 725 gallons of petrol per week - average. 725 x 52 weeks 37,700 gallons per year, or, 9,425 tins a year. 9,425 tins (9 Rs 3/3 per tin is Rs 30,042/- total value, § hf 0 duty = Rs 1,502/- Rs 1502/- calculated at say 1350 exchange, £ lll/5/-d.(App. duty) plus add^ 1% Import Yard charges £ 11 .

On the 36th ]: ebruary his excellency Shaiish Hamad bin ’Isa Al Khalifah,hi3 brother Shaikh ♦Aboullah bin ^sa ana the Adviser discussed the question with me. Both Ahaixhrs were very strongly in favour of receiving a lump sum annual rental (even if lower than £.bQ0/~) for the civil aerodrome at Auharraq and of continuing to obtain import duty on any petrol and oil importe&lt; They were perfectly reaay to allow engines,spare parts etcetera to enter free. They foresee the possibility of a considerable expansion m the amount ol petrol used ana leer that if they give up their import duty an civil petrol,they may then be asiced to cio tne same for petrol for the Kcyal ;ur Force. There is also administrative convenience in taxing petrol in bulK as it comes oft the ships. 3. There is force in their arguments,lor the duty on petro and oil used by Imperial Airways amounts to roughly £.l3b a year. Ghoulc the Dutch ana French aeroplanes use this route,or should /imperial Aimperial Airways develop t&amp;eir service,tfte duty au^at easily amount to tde greater part of tde sum of £.bOG wnicd das been suggested. Moreover,from tne enclosures to my Printeu Letter i*o:4l/ dated tne btn Larcd iy34,it appears possible tbat the Bahrain \rovernment may have not been receiving as much duty as they should have done. i recommend trial I should be permitted to come to an agreement with l.is Excellency Shaikh hamaa bin f Isa Al Khaiifah on the lines of:- (i) an annual rental of £.37b/-, ;ii; a continuance of the present uuty of b^ on petrol ana oil,end ^ * finding o* i piesuffie that,as recommended in my telegram uotea above,payment will be made with retrospective effect from the [y[f vtn October 193H,the date on which the lirst aeroplane of imperial Airways landed at &amp;uharra^. b.

V’'^' I have ascertained from Imperial Airways that iwuharraq was first used by the Company on October 6th 1932. We therefore agree to payment to the sheikh of £500 per annum as from that date. Will the India Office instruct the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf by cable to pay £1000 to cover the annual payment for the year 6th October 1932 to 5th October 1933, and the payment, for the year 6th October 1933 to 5th October 1934? presumably the rent in future should be paid annually in advance. If you will send the cable and let us have a Receivable Order for the amount (£1000) we can probably get it paid tnis financial year. I agree that the payment now made ought not to affect the date from which our proposed agreement with the Sheikh will run, and that the four year period of the agreement should run from the date of its signature. The only limiting factor in this connection is that our present agreement with Imperial Airways for the operation of the service to India terminates on March 31st 1939; therefore our agreement with the Sheikh should not be unduly delayed.

J 9 IVHIT JiH AL L ? 3 • W ♦ 1. 14tii iviarch 1934* Dear Bertram, With reference to our telephone conversation this morning, I enclose a copy of a telegram from the political Resident, No.T.51, which is, I think, self- explanatory. It is very satisfactory that the Sheikh of Bahrein should have accepted the proposed civil aviation agreement ana we should welcome your view on his suggestion that he should retain the right to levy customs auty at the present rate of h% on petrol and oil imported for aeroplanes, a reduction representing the average return of this duty from October 1932 being made in the annual payment of £500 a year proposed to be made to tne Sheikh under the air agreement. 2- I understand from our conversation that on a do point of principle you regard it^of great importance to secure the entry duty free under this agreement of petrol and oil, particularly in view of the possibility that the Imperial/ •b. Bertram, Esq., C.B.E., Air Ivan is try, Gwydyr House, Whitehall, 3 • '/(/ • laImperial Airways service to tne East may be strengthened in the future. There is also, of course, the possibility that the Sheikh, if he retains a completely free hand, may wish to impose a higher duty on petrol. The position as regards this is that under his treaties with us the maximum import duty which he can impose is 5%, but sanction was recently given, as a temporary measure, to the withdrawal of this limitation, subject, however, to the proviso that the Political Resident should be informed and given an opportunity to make any observations he might consider desirable before in fact any change in tariffs was made, and that concurrence in the temporary modification of this limitation was subject to the understanding that notice of four months should be given to tne Resident of any change of the nature in question. 3. The simplest course might be to press the sheikh to agree to exemption, on the understanding that if for any reason there was any increase in the loss of revenue involved to him in allowing petrol and oil for civil air purposes to enter duty free, a corresponding increase would be made in his subsidy, e.g. that in the event of Imperial Airways doubling their service and the amount of petrol/petrol and oil imported being in consequence doubled, the sub siay would be raised from £500 a year to £625 a year. 4. The Itesiaent will probably be in Bahrein about the 23rd March on his way back from India, and if it was at all possible to clear up this point in the next few days, so that instructions woula be awaiting him on his arrival, it might be possible for him to take the opportunity to discuss the matter personally with the Sheikh. I am sending copies of this letter to Rendel at the Foreign Office, ana to McClaughry. Yours sincerely, J.G.

D.C. A. AIR MINISTRY, G’.VYDYR HOUSE, WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 16to March 1934. Dear Laithwaite, Since our telephone conversation yesterday and the receipt of your letter to-day (your reference P.2.1750/ 34) with reference to the proposed Civil Aviation Agreement with the Sheikh of Bahrein, I have given the question further consideration and have discussed it with Shelmerdlne. IX you will refer Xo India Office letter (P*2.4434^ ilo 33) of 11th August 1933 to the Government of India forwarding copies of the Heads of Agreement and of ^lr Navigation Regulations to be made by the Arab Sheikhs of the Porsian Gulf, you will find no reference to the frequency of the Imperial Airways services. It was thougit by the Air Ministry that an inclusive annual rental of £500 -or a period of 4 years would he a sufficient recompense to the Sheikh ±or the lease of the aerodrome and for the privileges enumerated in Article 15 of the Heads of Agreement. It is of considerable importance as a matter of principle that Imperial Airways should not have to pay duty petrol which they will employ on their services, as this woula create an awkward precedent in the Persian Gulf. On the other nand, there is no reason why other companies such as the French and Dutch or private pilots when Permission is given for either one or the other to operate G ‘ fertP'^ite, Esq., on/ India Office, S.W. 1.2 - Vi I' &amp; on ulis Araoian sid.6 of tno Porsian G-ulf, should nof pay Hie duty. I would suggest, therefore, that the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, should he instructed to press the Sheikh to accept the £500 per annum for a period of 4 years after wnich date the Agreement could he reviewed, on the understanding that the supplies of petrol and oil referred to in paragraph 4 of the Conditions governing the use of uhe aerodiome will oe retailed to other users at a price which will permit of a special percentage being paid to the Sheikh to cover the Customs duties on petrol and oil then current at Bahrein. In the event of the Sheikh not being prepared to agree to a flat rate of £500 per annum for 4 years, the Political Resident should he asked to find out the minimum annual payment that the Sheikh would he prepared to accept. Any increase above the £500 would require Treasury approval. I am sending a copy of this letter to Rendel at the Foreign Office. Yours sincerely, P.G.L. BERTRAM.CONFIDENTIAI No. 0/341-13/7.

The principal correspondents in the file are Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven William Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch, Political Agent at Bahrain, Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, and representatives of the Air Ministry and India Office.There are multiple copies of the regulations contained in the volume, including: blank drafts drawn up by Government officials in 1933 (ff 11-16); one of the four original copies of the air agreement signed by the Ruler of Bahrain, Sheikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah, dated 6 June 1934 (ff 161-176); and printed copies of the 1934 Civil Air Agreements and Air Navigation Regulations for Bahrain and Kuwait (ff 185-187, 189-191, 193-194, 196-197). Correspondence related to the agreements deal with matters including: exemption of duty payable on aircraft fuel imported into Bahrain; priority given to military aircraft in using civilian aerodromes; authorisation requests (subsequent to the publication of the agreements) for aircraft belonging to Imperial Airways Limited, Indian Trans-Continental Airways and Qantas, to use aerodrome facilities at Bahrain.The volume also contains two newspaper cuttings: one from
