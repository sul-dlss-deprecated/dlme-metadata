The memorandum concludes by re-stating Italian denials of military intentions. The memorandum is written by Arthur William Moore.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Italy</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>First Assistant Resident, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Assab Bay</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Military occupation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Trade (practice)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000788.0x0003e2#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000788.0x0003e2#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000788.0x0003e2#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
