In a letter to the Political Resident, dated 24 April 1945, the Political Agent at Bahrain (Cornelius James Pelly) writes to confirm that the devices are meteorological monitoring sets (otherwise known as radiosonde apparatus), released twice daily by the United States Army Transport Corps Meteorological Department, which, the Political Agent adds, would like to have them back.The correspondence listed on the second page of file notes at the end of the file (f 8) does not describe or correspond to the contents of the file. Its title suggests that it was originally part of file no. 28/50 (which does not survive in the Second World War subject files).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consular Agent, Lingah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bandar-e-Lengeh</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Radio</topic></subject><subject><topic>Meteorological equipment</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000b2#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
