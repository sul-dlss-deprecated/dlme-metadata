This, I told him, would strengthen the position of the British and Italian Governments in making repre sentations on the subject of the traffic in arms at Jibouti . His Excellency agreed, and stated that stations would be created at certain places on the Coast of Italian r Edward Grey, Bart* r.P.Italian Somaliland, for the object of preventing the entrance of arms, as His Majesty's Government sug gested . He told me also that he had had a conversation lately with the French Ambassador, and that the latter though admitting the Insuperable French objection to the exercise of the right of search as far as ships are concerned, is inclined to recommend to his Government the adoption of measures to prevent the landing of arms from the small local craft - which are mere boats, and do most of the trade about Jibouti.

Since receiving your despatch of 4th May, however, regarding general policy, Aden, we have felt bound to suspend further action pending settle ment of general question, as its decision might seriously affect possibility of any action on our part, except at Aden itself, where such action is not required. If immediate action must be taken, it should apparently be restricted to further reference to French authorities as proposed both in regard to Jibuti and Muscat.

Since that date it has come to the notice of the Italian Government that the meeting at Jlbu i of the British and French authorities has not been productive of any practical results as regards the suppression of that traffic. Shortly afterwards the Italian Minister at Adis Abeba having, by older the Italian Government, taken steps with the Negus to induce P Sir E. Grey, Bart.

The above circumstances, combined with the fact that the Powers which recently/ met at Algeclras have just bound themselves to work together to prevent the importation of arms into Africa, have induced my Government to instruct me again to beg Your Excel lency to call the serious attention of the British Government to this most important matter, and to in form me whether they consider, as the Italian Govern- men&lt; ' d °' tha1 ' 6Jjy f urt ker postponement of the joint measures to be taken by Italy and Great Britain with respect to PVance, would (not) tend to multiply those regrettable incidents which we have already had cause to:11 to deplore.

I further proposed that the two Representatives, in making this representation, should, as suggested by the Italian Government, communicate to the French Govern ment the notes interchanged in 1903 between the Italian Government and His Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome on the subject of the Somaliland arms traffic. On the 22nd ultimo M. Pansa informed Sir C.

Count Tornielli, being instructed, like myself, to communicate to the French Government the text of the Agreement of October 1903 between the British and Italian Governments regarding the question, but not possessing copies of the notes by which that Agreement was effected, has requested the Italian Foreign Office to supply him with copies of them. The version of Admiral Morin’s note of the 28th October, 1903, with which your Lordship has supplied me, being an English translation, I was not in a position myself to furnish his Excellency with the Italian text. The Italian Ambassador will have to wait some days before sending in his note to M. Helcassd. Meanwhile, I transmit to your Lordship copies of the draft notes which we have prepared. If your Lordship should see fit to amend my draft, there will be time to do so, as Count Tornielli does not expect to receive the documents for which he is waiting for a week or ten days.

THE extent to which arms continue to be distributed throughout the Red Sea littoral has long been the subject of serious concern to His Majesty s Government, and your Excellency will remember that my predecessor, Sir Edmund Monson, proposed to you, in his note of the 14th August, 1902, that an endeavour should be made to repress this illicit traffic by means of an understanding between the Govern ments of France, Italy, and Great Britain. _ It was suggested in that note that the fact of the departure of dhows from Jibuti to ports outside the prohibited zone should be telegraphed to Aden, so as to enable the British, and through them the Italian, authorities to keep a watch on their proceedings. .

All vessels starting from Jibuti are obliged to proceed to Obock for examination before leaving the Bay of Tadjourah, and in these circumstances it is impossible tor them to land arms or ammunition on the French coasts of that bay. All the necessaiy measures have been taken to enforce observance m the interior of the French Colony of Jibuti of the provisions of the Brussels Act relating to the prohibition of the sale ol arms of precision in Africa. 1 , ... The merchants of the Colony have been informed of the penalties to which they would render themselves liable should it be found that they were selling arms and ammunition to the native races of the Tadjourah region. i a i i Your Excellency will perceive that the above observations ot the l' rench Ambassador contain no allusion to the export of arms from Jibuti to the opposite Arabian Coast for re-exportation to that of Africa. As this is the manner m which the traffic is chiefly conducted it will doubtless be necessary again to approach the French Government on the subject.

My Lord, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Colonial Office confidential despatch of the 15th in stant, on the subject of the Arms Traffic from Djibouti via Arabia to Somaliland. I have myself captured Gras Rifles on several occasions in Somaliland, which emanated clearly from Djibouti as was proved to my satisfaction by evidence obtained at the time. On one occasion in 1903 when in the Dogal, I captured after a fight a caravan taking thirty Rifles and two thousand rounds of ammunition to the Mullah. The evidence of prisoners showed that the Rifles had been brought from Djibouti to the Arabian Coast and from thence to Bender Casern in Italian terri tory. A headman of the Mullah’s who is now here on a visit has informed me confidentially that.the wallah has frequently obtained firearms from Djibouti via the Arabian Coast whence they are transhipped, to Illig Oi. Bender Casern. Some years ago I sent a servant to Djibouti v/ho had no difficulty in purchasing a Rifle and Aimiouni tion in the bazaar. During latter years, I believe, the local sales have become more strictly supervised, but on the other hand, all my information goes to show thatTni' that the traffic via the Arabian Coast to Somaliland has become more regular. Abyssinians also purchase arms in Djibouti and re-sell them without the knowledge of their superior officers to the Ogaden Somali Tribes south of Jigjiga. I obtained evidence of this whilst at Jigjiga, which was confirmed by Mr - Sm it he man, whom I sent to the Ogaden country. Mr Gerolimato, Vice Consul at Harrar will also have evidence as to this. 1 would observe that the evidence usually ol tained here is from secret Intelligence sources and that I am unable to publish the names of the men who keep me informed as to doings in the Mullah’s camp, but their information as to the traffic from Djibouti via Arabia is corroborated from so many independent native sources, that I have no doubt whatever as to the accur acy of the information. The Resident at iiden will no doubt hare had f ; | m ore opportunitiesthan myself of obtaining evidence as to the actual transhipments in Arabian territory. p attach a memorandum by the 1st Assistant Political Office.

Sir, I have the honour to forward you the follow ing note with regard to the illicit arms-traffic at Djibouti. The time at my disposal is so brief that they are short and unconclusive. Last year I captured 21 rifles in Western Grs Somaliland - 20 rifles and one L.E.Carbine. • Twelve of these fifles - r ere purchased at Djibouti and the remainder all borethe French Govern ment stamp and number. In the Ogaden my spies saw .in, one d&amp;y over a hundred rifles in the Her Earoun Karias. These were all Grs rifles. I can assure you that under present conditions it is possible to purchase in French territory as many rifles and as much zmmunition as you can pay for. Leading men with the Mullah report that Muscat and the Western Arabian ports are all supplied with riflesfrom Djibouti and that now there is an organized traffic in arms with Djibouti as the distribut ing point.

General Mason agreed with me, that as it was evident the Governor was not in a position to supply us with any documentary^ evidence as to the nature of the French Regulations, there would he no advantage in pressing the point, and the interview terminated most cordially with interchanges of compliments. My impression is that the French colonists find means to evade such Regulations as there may be, and that the Governor does not feel himself able to take the initiative in recommending measures to his Government which would be extremely unpopular, and which would, undoubtedly, if effective, injure the only part of the trade of the port which is in a flourishing condition. Whilst the local Administration at Jibuti is, I suspect, entirely in the hands of the trading community, and must court popularity, I was struck with the fact that no arms or ammunition were to be seen in any of the shops. On my former visits, fire-arms were to be seen everywhere, and cases of arms and ammunition were lying in the verandahs and on the quays. Now all this has been altered, and I do not think the change could only have been made for the occasion of our visit. I believe that as far as Jibuti is concerned, the Government takes measures for effectively storing the arms in transit, but once they have left Jibuti I do not think there is any attempt to insure their reaching their ostensible destination. A large number of these arms are undoubtedly re-exported to the Arabian Coast whence they are re-exported to Somaliland, and others are re-sold to the interior Somali Ogaden tribes by Abyssinian soldiers. I believe the Ogaden now have over 10,000 rifles. Whilst I think that the arms traffic has reached such a stage that it is impossible to stop it altogether, I think that there are certain steps which might, at least, be taken in order to make the importation of rifles to Africa as difficult and expensive as possible. The following suggestions are made, after an interchange of ideas with General Mason and Captain Halbert, R.N.:— (i.) An interchange of local Regulations between England, France, and Italy and the subsequent drawing up, if practicable, of more or less identical Regulations, copies of which will be sent to each of the Powers concerned. (ii.) The recognition by the Powers that the slave zone, as defined by the Brussels Convention, shall be identical in Arabia with the fire-arms’ zone, and that therefore the whole of the littoral of Arabia be a prohibited zone for the importation of fire-arms. (iii.) That trading craft sailing from the French or Italian Coast to the littoral of the Aden Protectorate be required to take out port-clearance papers direct for certain ports, to be specified by the Resident at Aden, where the dhows will be inspected and a vise will be endorsed on the papers. (iv.) It would be desirable, owing to the great interest the Turks have in pre venting the importation of arms into Arabia, to ask Turkey to join England, France, and Italy in adopting the above suggestions (i) and (ii). I attach a Petition just received from the people of Zeyla. The damage that the French railway was bound to do the Zeyla trade has been, at various times, brought to notice by my predecessor and myself. Although I understand that the interests of British importers through Jibuti and on the railway are now to be safeguarded, at the same time there still remains the question of the loss of trade to Zeyla, affecting as it does a people whose principal business lies in the disappearing caravan trade to Harrar. I he part of the Zeyla Petition referring to the abandoned project to interfere with the railway may receive special significance once the Esa have armed themselves and, unless we are prepared in the future to increase our police establishments on the border, we shall, sooner or later, be unable to prevent the Esa from arming them selves through Jibuti as well as the Danakil tribes, their neighbours and traditional enemies. \\ hilst the efficiency of any arrangements we make with the French, Italians, or Turks will always depend upon their being properly carried out by people over whom we have no control, I am quite convinced that, so far as the seaboard of our own Protectorate is concerned, we shall be able to absolutely stop the importation of arms directly we have available a steamer of our own, or a man-of-war specially placed at the disposal of the Administration. The proper supervision of the Makhir Coast eastward of Berbera is impossible without such a ship, and until we have this ship I do not feel justified in accepting any responsibility for the safety of the personnel of concessionnaires who now wish to start work in this direction.T have brought forward from former Estimates provision for a ship in the Estimates or 1906-1907, the sum of 15,0001. estimated as the ^ cost of a vessel bemg/4,000l as fi°naUv estimated in correspondence with the Admiralty, to which 1,0001. has been added as the cost of bringing the vessel out to Somaliland.

Inclosure 5 in No. 1 . .Notes of an interview held at Jibuti on Friday the hth January, 1906, at which were present Dr. Ormieres, the Governor of Jibuti; General H. M. Mason, the Political Resident of Aden ; General E. J. E. Swayne, His Majesty’s Commissioner and Com mander-in-chief of the Somaliland Protectorate; Commander A. R. Hulbert, Royal Navy, Senior Naval Officer of the Aden Division ; Captain F. de B. Hancock, Acting First Assistant to the Political Resident, Aden. GENERAL MASON informed Dr. Ormieres that rifles and ammunition of French manufacture were now both plentiful and cheap within the limits of the Aden Pro tectorate. He referred to the lawless &amp;nd practically uncivilized character of the Subehi and of some of the other tribes of South-Western Arabia into whose possession these weapons fell. He referred to the danger and inconvenience experienced in the Aden Hinterland owing to the ease with which rifles and ammunition could now be obtained throughout the Dependence. And he invited Dr. Ormieres to consider the possibility of taking further measures to check the indiscriminate traffic in arms which was apparently still taking place between Jibuti and the littoral of South-Western Arabia. ^0 ? 1 ^ rrn ^ eres re pli e d that the export of rifles to the Yemen was forbiddem He could not, however, afford any definite information as to the extent of the littoral to which this prohibition extended. He said that everything possible was being done to regulate the trade in arms and to restrict the dissemination thereof on the Somali oast. He said that only recently it had come to his notice that component parts of aims were being imported to Jibuti with a view to evading the Customs and other in es on the subject and that orders had been issued on the 30th December last to meet tins. 3. He appeared to recognize the inconvenience arising from the possession of arms o precision by uncivilized and lawless tribes, and to understand that the Subehi tribes nng occupy m regai d to the Aden Administration a somewhat similar position to that occupie y t e y sa tribe of Somalis in regard to Jibuti. He also appeared to recognize the risk of reimportation to Somaliland of the arms exported to Arabia. He referred to ic simi ar risk of the reimportation of the arms supplied to Abyssinia, Only two months ago he said that there had been a consignment of 1,800 rifles to Ras Makonnen at Harrar, and he evidently regarded it as possible that some of these would eventually 11 . ei ,T Wa ^ 3ac ^ coas t an d into the possession of those who should not properly possess tnem. a ^ so re ^ erre d to the risk of importation of arms from Muscat, in the Persian f ^ ie ^ ei . rec ^ kh 0 difficulty of exercising an effective control over the transport o aims y sea in na ive craft, and seemed well aware of the various devices resorted to res ric lon s. _ e said that he had reason to believe that the Sultan of C + 1 a S S n if ^ )a \ m tle ^ lclt arms traffic, from which he derived considerable P ° • 11118 Suitan, he stated occupied a position which rendered it difficult to exercise control over his littoral, fill recently he had been a tributary of both the enc an 0 ,a 1 ^ ,n e 1 irments. Upon a recent representation of the latter he had now ceased to be a French tributary.5. It was suggested to Dr. Ormieres that, with a view to further checking the illicit traffic in arms, it was desirable that the different authorities concerned should act in concert, and that the various Rules and Regulations issued by them should be as ar as possible, similar in effect and general principle. General bwayne handed him a copy of the “ Somaliland Fire-arms Regulations,” dated the 2 nd September, and a comparison of this with the Regulations issued at Jibuti was invited. In icp y, Dr. Ormieres stated that the orders which he received from time to time irom ins Government were of a confidential nature. Certain Rules had, however, been pu &gt;- lished, and he retired for a few minutes into his Secretariat to get t icse. 6 . Upon his return from his office he was evidently less inclined to b e con - nmnicative than before. He stated that, beyond a general prohAition of the lUicrt export of arms, there were no particular Rules on the subject, except such as embodied in the ordinary Police Rules of the Settlement or m hnculars issued o n various points, such as that already referred to regarding the mport of component parts of arms. Even that order, he said, was not in print, and had been sent to his home Government for confirmation. It became apparent that Dr. Ormieres did not hi himself in a position to produce any regular body of Rules or Regiilations for compaiii with those of the British Somaliland Protectorate, and that he was either unable unwilling to furnish any further information on the subject. , 7 . in turning the conversation, he referred to his recent experiences as an official in the French Congo, where it transpired that the nature of the Admimstiation was o a little affected hy commercial requirements. From this it might ^e pdersto°d that the Administration of Jibuti was perhaps somewhat similarly situated and that ^ commercial interests of the local colonists were a not unimportant faetoi situation.^ ^ tQ Obokh) Dr Ormieres stated that native wprp not mider the necessity of having their papers vised at that Foit Clearances, ne Td! were only granted there to vessels to which it was inconvenient to proceed to T.'PntJ nr to which it was inconvenient to touch at Oboim. _ , ^ 9 ’ D r Ormieres was informed of the arrangements existing at Aden under w jm native craft leavino- that port for British Somaliland were hound over to first call a certain prescribed 'ports on the coast before proceeding elsewhere, and it was suggestec m arms now ta ung p ace te was clearly animated by friendly motives, but eI tlie^ interStT oUSie^oral^ colonists were evidently predominant, and he was undoubtedly reminded of this fact in the course of the few minutes during wine 1 le had ht Ig^in broached^he sul^ect to General Swayne and, whilst S3S&amp;2 S 3 Eci ™..r •» .void —i..in« to I.»; -v *'» Tsrg Ks'jfSE. &amp; Acting First Assistant Resident, Aden. Aden, January 6 , 1906,,6 Inclosure G in No. 1. Notes of Discussion between General H. M. Mason and General Swayne, as to Measures which should be taken to further Check Illicit Trade in Arms, held on board Royal Indian Mail-Steamer “ Dalhousie ” on January 6 , 1906. IT was agreed upon that it was desirable that there should be an exchange of views between all local authorities concerned, with a view to more concerted action and the issue of a common set of Rides and Regulations under Aitides \ III and XI\ of the Brussels Convention. ^ . 2. The authorities most concerned were those of Great Britain, 1 ranee, and Italy. Turkey, however, was equally, or even more concerned, and should therefore be also asked to exchange views. 3. It was agreed upon as desirable that similar restrictions to those imposed in the zone referred to in Article VIII of the Brussels Convention should be extended to the whole of the slave zone referred to in Article XXI. 4. It was agreed that it would be of advantage if certain specified ports on the coast of the Aden Protectorate, &lt;?.&lt;/., Perim, Ras-al-Arab, and Aden were prescribed for the vise and examination of dhows’ papers before other ports in the vicinity were allowed to be visited. 5. It was agreed upon as necessary that both the Aden Protectorate and the Somali Coast littorals should be provided with an efficient service of preventive dhows and steamers. 6 . It was agreed upon as essential that arrangements should be made on the coast of Italian Somaliland to correspond with those made in British Somaliland. General Swayne pointed out the necessity of perfecting his arrangements as soon as possible, with a vievc to securing the early and more thorough co-operation of the Italian authorities. It was agreed that with this in view the matter of supplying him with an efficient protective steamer to supervise and assist his dhow service wms one of pressing urgency. 7. It was generally agreed that with an efficient preventive service of steamers and dhows a deal could be done to check the illicit traffic in arms, and that the smuggling could also be much checked by the framing of a common set of Rules and Regulations for the whole of the littoral affected. 8 . It was, however, agreed that the most effective check to the evil would be to prohibit the import of fire-arms into Eastern waters at all, or, anyhow, to impose more rigorous restrictions thereon, which might be arranged for by a special inspection post at Suez.

I have been directed by my Government to call the attention of His Majesty’s Government to the enclosed extract from a report by Captain Cerrina, Capitaine de Corvette, in command of the &lt;f Barbarigo,” of the Italian Navy, from which it would seem that contraband in arms is practised on a large scale in Migiurtina and the valley of the Nogal from the Arabian coast. My Government are convinced that the information contained in this report will lead the British Government to institute a strict surveillance with a view to preventing this in the ports of Arabi a which are subject to British protection. While awaiting whatever communication it may please your Excellency to make to me on this subject, &amp;c., I have, &amp;c., Sir E. Grey, Bart, M.P., A. de Bosdari. &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Annex 2. Extract from a Despatch dated 1st December 1905, addressed by the Officer Commanding His Majesty’s Ship “ Barbarigo, to the Italian Minister of Marine. Passing on to examine the efficacy of the work of armed ships and boats in regard to the suppression of the trade in firearms, I believe this to be very much lower than what might legitimately be hoped for; and in proof of this I may state that the natives are not few in number— esneciallv from among the followers of the Mullah—who are armed with rifles. As is well known, the traffic in arms is carried on from Jibuti to the Arabian coast, and thence the arms are introduced in small quantities of 5 to 10 in a boat to Migiurtina, or the mouths of the Noo*al, where the followers of the Mullah are always m large numbers and in positions naturally protected and artificially fortified, as I had to report in the case of Ail. This traffic is specially carried on alon 0, the Eastern coast where our armed boats cannot go and where a.warship rarely goes ; hut even in the case of a find it is always practi cally certain that a visit to the suspected ship will prove fruitless, because the boats see the ship, in the majority of cases, approaching from a distance, draw near to the shore, and land the forbidden articles; or, if surprised at anchor, they infallibly throw the arms into the sea, sure of being able to recover them by means of divers as soon as ever the ship has gone. The only chance of a capture, which might serve as an example, would be if there were reliable informers on shore, or if there were some in the principal Arabian ports, whence, however, it would be simpler not to allow the arms to he taken away ; some of these ports (the most important among them in this respect being jVlakalla) being under English protection.

In reply to Admiralty letter M 12756, of the 29th November 1905, be pleased to lay before the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty the following remarks on the question of gun running on the coast o Somali Land, and a patrol of that coast east of Berbera by His Majesty s ships. 2 I have delayed answering their Lordships letter until I had received reports from the various Senior Officers on the Aden Division-- Captain Eustace of “ Fox,” Commander Hulbert of “Proserpine and Commander Hill of “ Perseus ’’-which 1 had called for immediately on receipt of their Lordships’ letter quoted above. The last of these repoits was received bv me on the 27th instant, the English mail having left on the 25th. They cover a period of 14 months, November 1904 to 1st January 1906. 3. I tliiiik it as well that I should at once state that 1 am cocfluent that no patrol of the coast such as is suggested would he effective m preventing the importation of arms into Somali Land, and I would in this connection paraphrase Clause 4 of the Declaration ot Paris. &lt;»l 16th April 1856, which reads: “Blockades, m order to he binding, must he effective ” into “ Blockades in order to he effective must he complete, and unless we can persuade the French and Italian Governments to icin’us in such a blockade and make it complete, our efforts are worse than useless • for, if arms do continue to enter Somali Land, as stated, and we succeed in keeping them from entering British Somali Land they would still enter the French and Italian sphere of influence, so that . tribes in our own Protectorate would soon learn to hate us, tor they would he prevented by us from obtaining arms and womd thus be help less, and fall a prey to the Mullah’s men or other marauders Lorn the bordering tribes who know of their condition. Assuming however, that a blockade or patrol of the Somali Land coast is considered advisable by those who have only theoretical know ledge of such matters, I must point out, as a naval officer, the follo\un n facts:— , ,. . . tn\ The clearness of the atmosphere and the commanding view given ( ) from tlie hills near the coast enable the movements of a man of war or even a small steamer, to be seen and reported for hundreds of miles, it being well known that the Arabs have means of signalling, or of communicating information rapidly; even if this does not exist, they can see a vessel a great many /M The'coast of Somali Land is only roughly surveyed the scale of the chart is small, and care must he taken not to hoard dhows flvino' Turkish or other foreign colours outside the three miles limit! Ships must therefore frequently run into less than this distance from the shore, and their proceedings must he attended (c) Tim modern cruiser, such as “Perseus,” cannot maintain her [ nosition at sea moving even with moderate rapidity for more than a fortnight at a time, so that she would either have to S. S. 7. :Bleave the coast or be relieved to go to Perim or Aden to coal, at the expiration of that period ; this would entail the services of a second cruiser. As, however, one cruiser could not effec tively patrol or control the Somali Coast east of Berbera, the extent being too great, there would have to he at lea^t two cruisers patrolling, and at least one as relief—three in all as a minimum, and a fourth would have to be in reserve in case of a breakdown of machinery or other accident. 5. The whole question of patrolling the Somali Coast by ships and boats has, I believe, largely arisen from letters of Captain Eustace, of the “ Fox,” to General Swayne, the Political Pesident at Berbera. His letters ot the 20th and 23rd‘ September to that officer, when carefully read, vary somewhat in their statements, and that of the 20th September, eight piges in length, of which not a single paragraph is numbered, is full of hearsay and gossip, almost outside the province of a naval officer, and which it is impossible to verify; but, in order to obtain as much information as I could, I sent each of the captains of the ships a memorandum in the terms shown on the attached form, the replies to which are included therein. It will be seen that Captain Eustace attributes his lack of success to the “inexperience of the officers and to a lack of informers,” the former is not likely to improve, and the latter is a question of money; money would run through informers’ hands on. this coast as water runs through a sieve. His last experience of boat cruising in the “ Eox,” last September, near Perim, did not have satisfactory results in any way. It will further be seen he is of opinion that gun running into British Somali Land is now inconsiderable, and could be more cheaply and efficiently suppressed by subsidies to ihe local Chiefs than by men-of- war, and he also states that “at present the arms trade is almost entirely with Arabia and the Persian Gulf.’’ 6. The general opinion out here is that all arms for Somali Land come across from Arabia, from Jibutil, and some even from Sur near Muscat, at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, and that little active attempt is made even in the Protectorate of Aden to cheek the traffic in arms; no check on it elsewhere. Only in November last I received a report from Captain Eustace stating that dhows with arms were leaving Muscat for the Somali Coast. I wired to Muscat, but the Senior Officer, Persian Gulf, and the Political Agent at Muscat, after careful enquiry, were convinced that it was not true. I quote this to show that the matter is not lost sight of. 7. Erom paragraph 4 of this letter it will be seen that the squadron under my command cannot attempt to deal effectively with the patrol of the British Somali Land Coast alone, much less with that near dibutil and in the Italian sphere of influence, without entirely disorganising it. and that for the remainder of the north-east monsoon period (the only time when such a patrol could be necessary), it is impossible for me to spare more than the one ship doing duty as Senior Officer on the Aden Division which could pay occasional visits to Berbera as usual. The movements of the four cruisers under my orders will be as shown below, and prove my statement:— “ Hermes ” proceeds to Karachi about 12th March to wait on Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales until their departure from India on the 19th March, when “Hermes” proceeds up the Persian Gulf till end of April (this being of considerable importance) “ Eox ” will relieve “ Sphinx ” and “ Redbreast ” to refit at Bombay about 20th Eebruary, and will remain in the Gulf until late in Anvil when they will return there. * ’ “Perseus” escorts “Renown” to Aden on 19th March; then remains as Senior Naval Officer on that Division, relievingProserpine,” which proceeds to Bombay to make good defects, dock, and chip bottom, in readiness for re-commission. 8. Having endeavoured to show the difficulties and the inefficiency of the patrol of the coast proposed by General Swayne, I must again repeat the opinion expressed by me (Submission ISo. 152/49 of 29th November 190o), that the only effectual way of dealing with the question of the importation of arms into Somali Land lies in the hearty co-operation of the British and Indian Governments, the latter as regards the Aden Protectorate, and in an endeavour to induce the Prench and Italian Governments to join us in checking the export of arms to Africa and Arabia, and also in issuing orders to their officials in Jibuti 1 and the Italian Protectorate to do all in their power to stop the import of all arms should their measures to check the export not prove fully effectual. . . . The question of licensing dhows to fish in British territorial waters, is, I think, sound, but hardly comes under my province. 9. While I can quite understand General Sway lie’s anxiety to obtain the assistance of the Navy to help in cutting off the supply of arms to the Somalis, and am also aware that, should trouble unfortunately arise in his Protectorate in the future, he will be able to advance the theory that the natives have more rifles than formerly, owing to my attitude in the matter—still, I am willing to take that risk; firstly, because there are now only two or three months in which there could he any active trade in arms (south-west monsoon in May), and, secondly and principally, because I trust that, the question having now been so fullv raised and our relations with the Powers concerned being now so cordial, steps may be taken to put this question on a satisfactory footing at the fountain head. 10 In conclusion, there is one matter to which I must allude, that of establishing telegraphic communication between Aden and Berbera a distance of 148 miles. I attach great importance to tl- and would submit for serious consideration, that a wireless installation is et up in Aden and Berbera, in preference to a submarine cable being laid, as was once proposed. While it is a fact that the wireless apparatus supplied to the Somali Land Expeditionary Force failed, this failure was due to the difficulty of 'ettin 0 * a good earth and also sufficient height for the aerial X neither of ^details would affect an installation at the sea a Berbera and wireless would have the great advantage, especially at such a point as Aden, where the whole of the traffic of ^ thnt nur shins would always be m communication uith it u it bout aonroaching the port, and the same would hold good for a radius ot orobablv 200 miles from Berbera, this being the actual distance at S we exchange signals with Diamond Island Statmn after leaving ^“loToubt wireless is sometimes interfered by atmospheric especially towards rii'dit-fall, in these climates ; but, in my opinion, its advantages ouTweigb Us drawbacks; and, indeed,, think it is very advisable to set up wireless at Aden uithout fmt e del T; rec , ards the relative cost of a Marconi or other wireless • F n f Z otirl the lavioo- of a submarine cable, I am unable to installation, - ■ ° not tllink t ^ ie wireless would be the most express an °P^n, but I d WO uld not be necessary to set of buildings for and wages to operators should be about the same for each nature ot telegraphy.

Monsieur le Minlstre:- I have been directed by ray Government to call the attention of His Majesty*s Government to the enclosed extract from a report by Captain Cerrina, Capitaine de Corvette, in command of the 'Barbarigo 1 ' of the Italian Navy, from which it would seem that contraband in arms is practised on a large scale in Migiurtina and the valley of the Nogal, from the Arabian Coast. My Government are convinced that the in formation contained in this report will lead the British Government to institute a strict surveillance with a view to preventing this in the ports of Arabia which are subject to British protection. While awaiting whatever communication it may please Your Excellency to make to me on this subject &amp;c., I have &amp;c., Sir E. Grey, Bart. M.P. &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.\J V j A, Extract from a despatch dated 1st December 1905, ad- dressed by the Officer Commanding His Majesty's Ship 'Barbarigo*', to the Italian Minister of Marine. Passing on to examine the efficacy of the work of armed ships and boats in regard to the suppression of the trade in fire-arms, I believe this to be very much lower than what might legitimately be hoped for: and in proof of this I may state that the natives are not few in number - especially from among the followers of the Mullah - who are armed with rifles. As is well known, the traffic in arms is carried on from Jibuti to the Arabian coast, and thence the arms are introduced in small quantities of 5 to 10 in a boat, to Migiurtina or the mouths of the Nogal, where the followers of the Mullah are always in large numbers and in positions naturally protected and ar tificially fortified, as I had to report in the case of All. This traffic is specially carried on along the Eastern coast where our armed boats cannot go and where a warship rarely goes; but even in the case of a find it is always practically certain thata vjo) 1 visit to the suspected ship will prove fruitless, because the boats see the ship, in the majority of cases, approaching from a distance, draw near to the shore and land the forbidden articles; or, if sur prised at anchor, they infallibly throw the arras into the sea, sure of being able to recover them by means of divers as soon as ever the ship has gone. The only chance of a capture, which might serve as an example, would be if there were reliable inform ers on shore, or if there were some in the principal Arabian ports, whence however, it would be simpler not to allow the arms to be taken away; some of these ports (the most Important among them in this respect being Makalla) being under English protection.

Sir, In reply to Admiralty letter M-12756 of the 29th November 1905, be pleased to lay before the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty the following remarks on the question of gun running on the coast of Somaliland and a patrol of that coast east of Berbera by H.M. Ships. 2. - I have delayed answering their Lordships 1 letter until I had received reports from the various Senior Officers on the Aden Division, - Captain Eustace of 'Fox', Commander Hulbert of 'Proserpine', and Commander Hill of 'Perseus', - which I had called for immediately on receipt of their Lordships' let.ter quoted above. The last of these reports was received by me on the 27th instant, the English mail ♦ having left on the 25th. They cover a period of 14 months- November 1904 to January 1 |906. 3. - I think it as well that I should at once state that I am confident that no Patrol of the coast such as is suggested would be effective in preventing the importa tion of arms into Somaliland, and I would in this connect- I! ion paraphrase clause 4 of the Declaration of Paris of 16th April 1856, which reads 'Blockades, in order to be binding, must be effective' into 'Blockades in order to be effective must be complete', and, unless we can persuade the French and Italian Goverrumants to join us in such a blockade and make it complete, our efforts are worse than useless; for, ifuarms do corrtinuc bo cnt*cr Som3.lil3.Hd, 3&gt;s st-3.t. cd, 3-nd wc succeed in keeping them from entering British Somaliland, they would still enter the French and Italian sphere of influence;influence; so that the tribes in our own Protectorate would soon learn to hate us, for they would be prevented by us fron obtaining arms, and would thus be helpless, and fall a prey to the Mullah's men, or other Marauders from the bordering tribes who know of their condition. 4.- Assuming however that a blockade or Patrol of the Somaliland Coast is considered advisable by those who have only theoretical knowledge of such matters, I must point out as a Naval Officer the following facts:- (a) The clearness of the atmosphere and the commanding view given from the hills near the coast, enable the movements of a man of war, or even a small steamer, to be seen and reported for hundreds of miles; it being well known that the Arabs have means of signalling, or of communicating informa tion rapidly; even if this does not exist, they can see a vessel a great many miles off. (b) The coast of Somaliland is only roughly surveyed, the scale of the chart is small, and care must be oaken not to board Dhows flying Turkish, or other foreign colours, outside the 3 miles limit. Ships must therefore, frequently run into less than this distance from the shore, and their proceedings must be attended with some risk. (c) The modern cruiser, such as 'Perseus' cannot main tain her position at sea moving even with moderate rapidity for more than a fortnight at a time, so that she would either have to leave the coast, or be relieved to go to Perim or Men to coal, at the expiration of that period; this would entail the services of a second cruiser. Has, no eve^, one cruiser could not effectively patrol or control the Somali coastooaat east of Berbera, the extent being to great, there would have to be at least two cruisers patrolling and at least one &gt; as relief; - three in all as a minimum, and a fourth would have to be in reserve in case of a breakdown of machinery or other accident. ■ 5.- The whole question of patrolling the Somali coast / by ships and boats has, I believe, largely arisen from letters of Captain Eustace of the 'fi'ox' to General Swayne, the Political Resident at Berbera. His letters of the 2()tn and 23rd September to that officer, when carefully read, vary somewhat in their statements, and that of the 20th September, 8 pages in length, of which not a single paragraph is numbered, is full of hearsay and gossip, almost outside the province of a Naval Officer, and which it is impossible to verify; but in order to obtain as much information as I could, I sent each of the Captains of the ships a memorandum in the terms shewn on the attached form, the replies to which are included therein. It will be seen that Captain Eustace attributes his lack of success to the 'inexperiehce of the officers and to a lack of informers'; the former is not likely to improve, and the latter is a question of money: - money would run through in formers' hands on this coast as water runs through a sieve. His last experience of boat cruising in the '^ox', last September, near Perim, did not have satisfactory results in any way. It will further be seen he is of opinion that gun running into British'.Somaliland is now inconsiderable and could be more cheaply and efficiently suppressed by subsidies to the local chiefs than by men of war, and he also states that 'at present the arms trade is almost entirely with ArabiaArabia and the Persian Gulf.” 6, - The general opinion out here is that all arms for Somaliland come across from Arabia, from Jibutil, and some even from Sur near Muscat, at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, and that little active attempt is made even in the Protectorate of Aden to check the traffic in arms - no check on it elsewhere. Only in November last I received a report from Captain Eustace stating that dhows with arms were leaving Muscat for the Somali Coast. I wired to Muscat but the Senior Officer Persian Gulf and the Political Agent at Muscat, after careful enquiry, were convinced that it\was not true. I quote this to show that the matter is not lost sight of. 7. - From paragraph 4 of this letter it will be seen that the squadron under my command cannot attempt to deal effectively with the patrol of the British Somaliland Coast alone — much less with that- near Jioutil and in the Italian sphere of influence - without entirely disorganising it, and that for the remainder of the N.E. Monsoon period (the only 'time when such a patrol could be necessary) it is impossiole for me to spare more than the one ship doing duty as Senior Officer on the Aden Division which could pay occasional visits to Berbera as usual. The movements of the 4 cruisers under my orders will be as shewn be1ow and prove my statement tt HERMES’* proceeds to Kurachi about 12th March to wait on Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales until their departure from India on the 19th March when ’’Hermes” proceeds up the Persian Gulf till end ot April (this being of considerable importance). 'FOX”'FOX” will relieve ’’Sphinx 11 and ’’Redbreast” to refit at Bombay about 20th February, and will remain in the Gulf until ^ late in April when they will return there. ’’PERSEUS” escorts ’’Renown” to Aden on 19th Marchj then remains as Senior Naval Officer on that Division, relieving ’’PROSERPINE” which proceeds to Bombay to maxe good defects, dock, and chip bottom in readiness for recommission. 7.- Having endeavoured to show the difficulties and the inefficiency of the patrol of the coast proposed by General Swayne, I must again repeat the opinion expressed by me (Submission No.152/49 of 29th November 1905) that the only effectual way of dealing with the question of the importa tion of arms into Somaliland lies in the hearty cooperation of the British and Indian Governments, the latter as regards the Aden Protectorate, and in an endeavour to induce the French and Italian Governments to join us in checkin:, tne export of arms to Africa and Arabia and also in issuing orders to their officials in Jibutil and 4 'he Italian Protect orate to do all in their power to stop the import of all arms should their measures to check the export not prove fully effectual. , The question of licensing dhows to fish in British territorial waters, is, I think, sound, but hardly comes under my province. 9.- While I can quite understand General Swayne’s m&amp;sm anxiety to obtain the assistance of the Navy to help m cut ting off the supply of arms to the Somalis, and am also aware that should trouble unfortunately arise in his Protectorate in the future, he will be able to advance the theory that the natives have more rifles than formerly, owing to my attitudeattitude in the matter - still I am willing to taice that risk; firstly because there are now only two or three months in which there could be any active trade in arms (S.W. Monsoon in May) and secondly and principally, because I trust that the question having now been so fully raised and our rela tions with the Powers core erned being now so cordial, steps may be taken to put this question on a satisfactory footing at the fountain head. 10.- In conclusion, there is one matter to which I must between Aden and Berbera, a distance of 143 miles. I attach was once proposed. While it is a fact that the wireless apparatus supplied to the Somaliland Expeditionary Force failed, this failure was due to the difficulty of getting a good earth and also sufficient height for the aerial wirej neither of these details would affect an installation at the sea at Berbera, and wireless would have the great advantage,- especially at such a point as Aden, where the whole of the traffic of the East passes, - that our ships would always be in communication with it without approaching the port, and the same would hold good for a radius fif probably 200 miles from JTerbera, this being the actual distance at which we exchange signals with Diamond Island Station after leaving No doubt wireless is sometimes interfered by atmospheric 1 allude, - that of establishing telegraphic communication i Rangoon. especially towards night-fall in these climates, but, in my opinion.io\ * opinion, its advantages outweigh its drawbacks; and indeed putting Berbera on one side, I think it is very advisable to j set up wireless at Aden without further delay. as regards the relative cost of a Marconi or other wireless installation and the laying of a submarine cable, I am unable to express an opinion, but I do not think the wireless would be the most expensive, as probably at the Aden * end it would not be necessary to set up a dynamo, and the cos t of buildings for and wages to operators should be about the same for each nature of telegraphy.

Sir, I have the honour to report as follows On the 5th January at Jibouti I was present at a meeting previously arranged between the following officials, the Resident of Aden and his ^irst Assistant, the Commissiora? of Somaliland and the Governor of Jibouti. The subject discussedwas the trade in arms and ammu nition at Jibouti. General Mason opened the discussion by s; eaking of the fully armed condition of the tribes in the Aden Hinter land, particularly referring to the fact that the vast majority of the arms and ammunition possessed by these tribes were of French manufacture, and he expressed his conviction that these weapons came at some time or other either directly or indirectly from Jibouti. General Mason them referred to the danger to all the European Protectorates resulting from the armed condition of these semi savage tribes both in Arabia and Somaliland , and expressed a wish to find, if possible, some means of act- ingiin concert with the French and Italian authorities to stop or reduce the smuggling of arms and ammunition into Arabia and Somaliland which was undoubtedly taking place to a disquieting extent. General Swayne produced the Somaliland Firearms regulations, a copy of which was presented to Dr Ormieres, the French Governor, who was asked by General Mason whether he could furnish the Aden Government with copies of the regulations enforced at Jibouti. Dr Ormieres was unable or The Com^ander-in-Chief, H.M. Ships &amp; Vessels, 1 Tr&gt;rH s4 unwillingunwilling to produce any regulations at all. He referred to the Brussels Convention, and stated • that the export of arms from Jibouti to the Yemen Coast was forbidden. He stated that he had no force at his disposal to carry out with effect any stringent regulations on the sub ject, and volunteered the opinion that no doubt smugglers did evade the laws. In short it was evident that there were no real efforts made by the French authorities to check the secret export of arms from Jibouti by sea, or to prevent them d finding their way into Somaliland via the Jibouti Railway. Large quantities of arms and their component parts arrive at . Jibouti consigened to the Emperor Menelik, but tmere is no means of telling what is the real destination of these arms. Dr Ormieres stated that there v/as a large trade in arms from Europe to Sur (near Muscat) and that doubtless a considerable number of the arms in Somaliland and Arabia came through that port. finally, after a rather protracted and abortive dis cussion, Dr Ormieres expressed his desire to do all in his power to cooperate with the British and Italian authorities to stop the illicit arms traffic, and stated that he would lay before his Government any proposals which might be for warded to him from Aden. The meeting then broke up after having lasted about an hour. The proceedings throughout were conducted in the most informal and amicable manner. I see no reason to alter the opinions which I expressed in my reply to the questions in your confidential memorandum No.49 ofl the 23rd December 1905. Nothing—r* Nothin^ new was elicited by the meeting at Jib out i, . but there is additional evidence of a negative kind to show that the roots of the arms trafficin this part of the world j lie in Jibouti and Sur. There is abundant evidence in the Resident's office at Aden to prove these facts, and it is also quits certain that the Arabian tribes have completely armed j themselves. It is obviously a waste of money to patrol the coast j of British Somaliland for the sole purpose of preventing gun running, when arms can be landed anywhere in Italian terri tory, or obtained through the Ogaden Country near the, Jibouti Railway. In short, if the arms trade of Jibouti and Sur can- not be stopped by diplomatic means, very little can be effected towards preventing the importation of arms into British Somaliland• I have, &amp;c., (sd) - R.

The village looks exactly the same as on the previous visit in January 1906; there are no ne^ huts or buildings; the natives seem mostly employed in fishing, in ^hich they ^ were engaged on our arrival. Several dho^s have latelv beer anchored in the bay pearl fishing - they are said to cone from Zaila and Jibuti. Some of the cra-rs landed to get water from the village, but no further information could be obtain ed about them. 3. The Sheikh informed me that on the evening of the 29th ^ December 1906 about 11 men from the Subaiya tribe had come near the village intending to attack them, but had all dis appeared by the '.erning. Nobody seems actually to have seen them, but their camel tracks were traced in the morning. These tracks were pointed out to me, but it ’mas impossible for me to tell what or how many there were. 4. About 9 months age the village was attacked by j.y, f ^ thes* people and lost four men killed, the Subaiya losing one. I sa- one of the men who hadbeen wounded, he had a bullet mark Just above the ankle. During my visit there were nine or ten men in the village carrying their rifles which were of French make marked ”St. Etienne', but apparently there are a lot more rifle in &lt; store, as Jommander A. R. Hulbort, H.M.S. 'Proserpine”. the Sheikh said that every man in the village carriescarries a rifle when required to. Those who carried them were the Sultan of Lahej’s troops, ^ich there a^e about 20 in the village, 5. There is a daily coimmication with Lahej by cauel, a rider leaving aarly in the morning, arriving at Lahe.i about 6 in the evening, and returning the next day. There is no water in the village; it has to be brought in every day in skins on camels from a well which is situated, some ten miles in a N.T. direction. 'Tie camels are escorted by some of the troops, ^hey usually leave early in the morning and return in the afternoon about 4 o f clock. 6.

Swayne and of the illicit traffic in arms generally. 2. I have addressed several other communications on the same subject to the Government of Bombay since my letter Ho.187, dated 9th October 1904, concerning v/hich you will'doubtless be addressed in due course through the usual official channels. But meanwhile, I have the honour to enclose copy of a letter Ho.6630, dated the 29th October 1905 which deals at more length with the subject than most of the other reports. 3. The reports above refeir ed to may be considered sufficient to show that considerable traffic in arms does still take place from Preneh territory with dangerous effects to this Protectorate as well as to British Somali land but the follcw’ing further details may also prove of interestinterest to the Foreign Office, 4, On the 26th of January 1905 Captain A.K. Kulloert Commanding H.M.S. 'Proserpine' paid a visit to the port of Imran over which the Ahdali Sultan is under present armpe- mentafcharged with the control. There he found that there were a lar t 'e number of rifles in the village ol which the greater number were French and marked Chateau Renault, He saw and handled several himself and was informed by the inhabitants that there were then about 90 rifles in the village• As a result of his visit he expressed the opinion that Imran was an important depot for traffic in amis and I have no reason to doubt that arms from Jibouti have been frequently landed there. This visit was reported to the Government of Bombay in February 1905, when it was pointed out that there was reason to believe that the Abdali Sultan was personally interested in the arms traffic and derived profit therefrom, 5, In May 1905, information was received in this Office from two sources of the import of arms to small ports on the shores of this Protectorate, A Somali informant laid stress on the fact that Arabs experienced no diffi culty in purchasing arms at Jibouti which they afterwards sold to Sogralis. 6, On the 18th June 1905 a dhow flying Turkish colours was arrested by H.M.S. 'Perseus' in Imran Bay with four French rifles and 29 rounds of ammunition concealed on board. She was subsequently released by order of the Bombay Government in view of the master's contention that he was only carrying the arms for his personal defence. 7, In the course of various interviews held with the Sheikh of the Juledi sub-tribe of the Subehis in the course of the year 1905, it was perfectly apparent thatW) ^ • f the import of French rifles and ammunition was a common occurrences on the Attifi littoral between Sheikh Said and Aden. 8. Both the Senior Faval Officer of the Aden Divis ion and the Assistant Resident, Perim, have also reported similar imports on the Turkish littoral lying to the ITorth of Sheikh Said. _ 9. Last December, the Assistant Resident, Perim, reported the following instances (a) . On the 24th ITovember 1905, a dhow - the Tateh-al- Khair commanded by Mahommad Hassan left Jibouti and landed 50 rifles and 10^ boxes of ammunition at Ras-al-Arah. (b) . On the 25th November 1905, the dhow A1 Keiaj, commanded by Abubukkar Abdulla al Maabi left Jibouti and landed 100 rifles and 20 boxes of ammunition at Dubab. (c) . On the 25th November 1905, a dhow commanded by one Kaid Abdoola left Jibouti with 80 rifles and 10 boxes of ammunition which he landed at Kadha. These instances were doubtless not based upon absolutely unimpeachable information but were probably in tre main correct. 10. In the 3rd paragraph of my report No.265, dated 14th Instant^ I have already remarked upon the traffic between Lahej and Haura on the East Coast of txiis Pro - tectorate. And I can confidently .! y assert that a consider able traffic in arms takes place on that coast as well as on the coast lying to the west of the protectorate. Only a few days ago I was informed by a reliable Native State official that many Prench rifles found their way into the Interior of the Aulaki district via Balahaf. 11. A few days ago, I received a letter from the Sultan^ 11 Sults.n of the Aulalci in v/hich. I was asked to assist o£e of his agents to proceed to Jibouti where the Sultan desired him to expend $ 300 on the purchase of rifles. 12. It would seem unnecessary to multiply instances in support of the contention that arms traffic is rife within the limits of this protectorate. 13. This undoubtedly affects British Somaliland but also seriously affects this Protectorate. Only yesterday a postal runner carrying the mails was shot within a short t/ distance of the British village of Sheikh Othman and has | since died: the mail being robbed. I have reason to be lieve that his assailants were probably Attifi, Subehis, and that they were armed with rifles of French manufacture imported direct from Jibouti or Obokk to their coasts. 14. This is of course only a single incident of passing importance, but should it be proved that the assail* ants were Attifis and should it be decided to take measures to secure their punishment or arrest, it is needless to point out that with the greater number of the Subehi tribes fully armed with French weapons of precision this will prove a far more serious undertaking than would otherwise be the case. 15. Similarly any other action of a repressive or corrective nature which circumstances may any day neces sitate will be fraught with enhanced risk and difficulty for a similar cause. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, I / 100NyX151NTIAL r ^rom t Ma,jor-G?&gt;:- -'..l . M. » POLITICAL at ADEN To, POLITIC ■ r ' Y - j PABT^IBWT f nmtBAY 9 » With ref erone© to our letter CG*8298 f dated 22nd ■ ember 1905, I have the honour to inform you that last week I visited the Port of Jibouti im oompany with General E.J.l. Sways®, C.B*, His Majesty*# Commissioner and Co: lender in-Chief of the Somaliland Protectorate and to now forward the further comuni cation indicated in paragraph 28 of my letter No•6630, d ted the 29th October last, 2. Proa the attached copy of a Note of the Interview which was held with His Excellency the Governor of Jibouti on the 5th January- 1906, it will appear that vary little information was afforded by' that official and also that he was unable to consider any fur her co-operation in the mat .or of checking the illicit am# traffic in the absence of ins tructions from his Government. 3. I need not further remark upon the fact that an in discriminate traffic in arms actually does take place be tween the African and the Arabian Coasts of the Bed Boa. This Protectorate is full of cheap drench rifles and cart*** ridge#n ' joi ) 11 cartridges and there is no doubt that this supply ©namates from Jibouti. I have ersry reason t© belieT® that a consider able amount of direct traffic has quite recently taken place between Obokh and the ports situated on the west coast of thi Protectorate and it was only last month that I received credible information of the successful landing of a direct shipment of SO rifle© and 10 boxes of ammunition to Ras-al- /rah. Only recently ale© I have received credible inform ation of the purchase of French rifles at LaheJ ard of their subsequent sale at the port of Haura on tue oast coast oi t le Protectorate, 4# I have no reason to doubt that a traffic of this nature still actively continues. Aram ara imported on the coast lying to the west of Men f are transported overland, any of them via £ahoj, to the ports lying to the east of ,\den. And from there,of erurso, re~!iip©rtatioii to the coast of Africa via the Italian Protectorate or portions of the British Protectorate is comparative?ly simple a d in all pro bability considerable. Tho mere fact that French rifles uid ammunition are plentiful and cheap on the littoral of this Protectorate constitutes proof of the traffic. And from the above it is evident that the Somali Coast as mXX as this protectorate is undoubtedly affected. 5. It will be observed from the attached Hot© of Inter view that Doctor Ormieres whilst committing himself to the general statement that the export of arms to Yemen w*s for bidden was nevertheless unable to define the extent, of the littoral affected by this prohibition. It will be remembered that In Becembar 1901,Sir B. Monsen ... . made mention of M. Minf-er’s ** ■ **4*4' • gtat#aen t that the French /qp/, 0ov^ms-int were pow^rlQBS to prevent the shipping at Jibouti of ams on vessels destined J1 dostinad for ports outside the zone in which the s; Xo of arms and spirituous liquors was forhiddea and that this at» titudo Of tb tv inch OororHinent ms also re for rod to ia Goranuaent of India despatch !'o»83^ dated Sl;;t April 1304, to the Secretary of State for Indfc. The smw attitude ap pears to hare boon taken in sore recant correai-oadesoe whore* in, whilst an acsu-anco is giyoa that all aecosaary neasnrea ha¥0 hoon taken to onforoe the oha rv. nco of the provisions of the Brussels • Act ralating to the prohibit ion of the sHe of ar :s of precision in Africa, there is no allusion to the Export of arras from Jibouti.to the opposite coast of Arabia, for possible re-export an toth i coast of Africa. And it will be noted that Doctor Orreier i’spresent assurance that the export of arras to the Yemen is forbidden is inconsistent with the above and possibly not quite accurate. 6. I would hare invite reference to the attached Hots of a Discussion Which I had with General Ssayne on the 6th Instant so-, to farther raea .urea to be taksn to chec; the illicit arms traffic. ?ron the 3rd p&amp;ragrajsh of this mi f roa the 10th paragraph of the Note of Interview with Doctor Omiers#, it *411 appear that General Ssayne concurs with ms I in the opinion that further action is desirable to carry out ! the spirit of the wording of the first part of Article X f j the Brussels* convention and to,if possible, extend the res- I tristions Inposed in the arras nd spirituous liquors zone of that Convention to the Whole of the slave zone referred to in Article X&amp;I. 7. The word ng Ajf Article X of the Convention -or the passage thereof to regions whore the Slave Trade is rife* (aoit le passage vers les regions ou sevtt la Sraite) wool* seera to justify a request for further co-operation in the direction above Indicated. And whenoArticle 6 of the Agroo- »ant of 1888 is also taken into consideration, it would nut a$P oar f-.» / jt'l&amp; - J H]I 1 appear that local ’french authority in really justified in either withholding information or declining co-operation when called upon to do so. 8 . It will be. observed that General Swayne handed Doctor Ormieree a copy of the latest Somaliland Fire-ams Hegulation and that nevertheless no effective response was forthcoming . Under Article XI of the Bru 0 sel@ , Conference it would not appear that Doctor Omieres was justified in this lack of re sponeivene be. 9 . I would hero invite attention to Doctor Oraicree* re* narks concerning OBokh, which appear inconsistent with the assertions contained in Mr. Beuvier** letter to Sir Bertie dated 13 th ^eptenfoor last f concerning that |lort._ In point of fact I have reason to believe that Obokh so far from being a preventive port a© would appear fron M. Boiivler f s reference the re to f is the actual centre of a consid--**/ able mount of diroi t traffic in ar is with the coast of Arabia. The traffic in arms between Obokh and Kaddulia is* I referred to by the Senior lava! Officer of the Aden Division in his despatch to the Cofvnand*r-in~Chiof of the Mat Indies dated 1 st S^t^bor 1905 of bhich a copy has boci forwarded to me with your Ho. 8316 * datsd ZZnd Ultimo. And the ante- codents of M* Grandjean, the offici 1 posted to th,- i port* a arc such as to confirm the possibility of his hlmsalf taking a part in the traffic tilder reference - (Sac Appendix A * attached). 10 . I see that Captain Bus taco in the sarsa despatch refers to the part taken In this and the Slaw Trade fcjr Sehalto dhows and It would mom probable that Doctor On::lores* etste- taant regarding the Saltrm of that district is not without some foundation. li* Doctor .Omlorus 1 reference to Abyssinia is also &lt;?.y* serving t i / tCq'.-* *'* ^dlsserring of consi deration cind it is a somewhat curious coiacidoaco that oniy this ^iolc it h&amp;s been brought to my notice that there has just been an exchange of hands one pro- sants betw eon Has MaJconen Abdali Bultrm and ffcg, conaec %X onith vm ams traffic reference has frequently ba-'^n W&amp;tm* I am not aware of wha.t rule# or renulatoiie may exist at Abyssinia in rc^urd to the traffic In arms, but it uld appear desirable that rules should exist there and bo in line with those issued in British Semliland and elsewhere In the reriom affected# 12. General Sway no concurs with me as to the desirability of the various miles and regulations issued on the subject by the different authorities concerned beiag an far ?js poc- sirlc similar in effect and gomreX principle, and ith that in view as to the desirability of a comen exchange of views. 13. So far as Jibouti is concerned, I ass of opinion that their rules should a© closely as possible correspond with f e latest Somaliland Mro-ams Hegul&amp;ilons, copy attached, in vdnlch it will be observed that there is provision B (Dj against the fraudulent re * i^&gt; e r t at 1 o n of arms to the pro* Jiibited zone. But X am also of opinion as aforesaid that the Slave Eonc, which of course includos the li^toral of this Protectorate as wall as that of the Persian Gulf, should bo considered as included in the prohibited sons# 14. If any preventive post is established at Gbokh it should be under responsible and efficient surveillance, and I consider that to check illicit traffic in the Gulf of Tajurrah it is necessary that the French author!ti#os should maintained a similar service of preventive dhows and steamers . to t&gt;i. .t maintained by other posers concerned# 15# I stm rJlso of opinion that it is desirable that local rules should be framed at Jibouti on the line© of the Regul ation III of 1902 made applicable at Adea, and I think thatIf thee© arranges mt» am he effected, the illicit traffic in 16. It is clear, however, that the most effective check to the evil compId nad of would he the imposition of more stringent restrictions upon the export of arms from Europe to within the limits of the prohibited sons, and it is with this in view, that I concur with General Sv&amp;yno in the opinion that a check is desirable before the Stic# Canal is left for the Rod Sea. 17. Turning now to consideration of the iU ;Stion of Italia co-operation, I have the honour to state that I concur with General Swayne in the opinion that it is most desirable that this should be more thorough* la this connection, I attach copy of a minute dated the 30th ultimo, drawn up by Captain Hancock and ©f his Wotc of an Interview with Co-imcndatore Pestaloaaa on the subject, dated 39th December 1905. 18. There is no doubt that the con r©l at present exorcis ed by the Italian Government over the littoral of their Somaliland Protectorate is very small, and that thuir assump Comnendatore Rsstalosaa is now anxious to establish control at Has Alula as well as at Bunder Cassxm and is a.lwo, of course, anxious to so establish himself at these ports as to provide tor tho recoupment by customs taxation At; ic expenses incurred by his Government in maint intng even their present position on the coast. It Is most desirable that the con trol exercised over this portion of the littor.U. of the African Coast should be acre effective* 19* This is of course store desirable from the point of view) ©f the other Somali Coast authorities than from the point of view of thiib administration. ButM^both points of view it is equally or rather^ more desirable that the control arras would be sufficiently checked, even granted the continued importation of am© from Burope to Jibouti. exercisedoxercisoa hy m or®r tho littoral of tHia Protectorate should aM &gt; ;0 ra r ro offoctiva.

With a view to the exercise of a more effective con trol over the littoral of this protectorate, I have the honor to recommend the early establishment of a Preventive Service of Anted M«ss Md Stemsrs. The attacked *&gt;te by Captain. Uncock based upon his recent discussion with Captain Bor deaux Shows approximately the nature and cost of t a under taking. She cost is not Inconsiderable but the ultimata Object to be gained may be hold to justify it. 0rEmtua it may not bo desirable to too rapidly extend our influence in the Interior, it cannot bo disputed that our position on „ AA.n and fho ^rnim Oulf is a the littoral of the Gulf of Aden anc Hatter of grave Import nee. 22 . At Rae-al-Aruh, I consider it Bt desirable that a post Should now ho established and that an effective control Should bo exercised over the *.t*y Attifi tribes which haveM i M \ consistently ignored our wiDhas and defied our cojjrianda not only in re yard to the traffic in arms but also in roya^d to .ral proscnratioii of order* It is not lone ago that 7 b v, ou -ht to the notice of £ot rtmo nt the can© of an Italim bjoct murdered upon the coast the perpetrator of ^hich a never been brought to justice, and according to say inform lien this is only one of several acts of similar nature )t lit ted in the vicinity of Kfi.c«*al~ Ar ah* It was at our instance that acts of piracy co mitted -w the ^amnife trihos have recently bean punished by the tedeida authorities, and it believes us to maintain a more .perfect order upon the comparatively limited extent of our g hit to ral* In the mm nwp en I iwost to Sir B* 0* Conor f s Secret letti-r Ho * 818 , dated 20th Hovesber last, th ••re. is mention of the arrangement now being mads by the Turkish Ooveranent to exercise a more effective control over their coast, and I a© of opinion that wo are called upon to adopt similar sea;-urea for the bnv. : ?r control of our own* 24 * X would therefore rocoi^cteM that early arrangement* should be made to furnish Pc rim with a small armed, revaauo otoamor and.

It was agreed upon that it was desirable that there should bo an exchange of view® between all local authorities concerned with a view to more concerted action and the issue of a common set of rules and regulations under Articles VTII to XIV of the Brussels' Convention. 2. The authorities most concerned vere those of Great Britain, France and Italy. Turkey however was equally or even more concerned and should therefore bo also asked to exchange views. 3. It was agreed upon as desirable that similar restrict ions to those imposed in thu ^one referred to in Article VIII of the Brussels Convention should be extended to the whole of the Slava Sone referred to in Article XXI. 4. It was agreed that it would be of advant p;e if certain specified ports on the Coa,st of the Aden protectorate, e.g., Perim, Has-a!- rah and Aden were pr scribed for the vise and examination of dhows• papers before other ports in the vicinity were allowed to be visited. 5. It was agreed upon as necessary that both the Aden Protectorate and the Somali Coast littorals should be provided with an efficient service of Preventive Dhows and Steamers. 6. It was agreed upon as essential that arrangements should be made on the coa t of Italian Somaliland to corres, ond with those made in British Somaliland. General Swayno pointed out the necessity of perfecting his arrangements as soon as possible with a view to securing the early and more thorough co-operation of the Italian authorities. It was agreed th t with this in view the matter of supplying him with an efficient Protectives Prottictivo Steanier to suporvia© and assist his dhow service was ono of pressing urgency. 7. It was generally arreed that with an efficient pre ventive service of steamers '-nd dhows a p;ood deal could ho done to check the illicit traffic in arms and that the smuggling could also he much checked by the framing of a common set of rules and regulations for the whole of the littoral affected. 8. It was however agreed that the most effective check to the evil v*ould be to prohibit the import of fire-arms into Eastern waters at all or anyhow to impose more rigorous res trictions thereon, v, ich might be arranged for by a special inspection post at Sues.

This is in continuation of my confidential letter of the 14th Octob r 1905 (No.786/c). I was charged by Colonel Sadler to stcx&gt; the Grandjean-''anotte party on its being known it had entered the Esa country within our borders. I proceeded to the vicinity of the Esa G&amp;dabursi frontier with Camel Corps overland, but eventually v after three weeks delay, found that the Erenchman had had difficulties with the Esa and had been obliged to return. I returned tc the East of Somaliland leav* ing patrols, and instructions to a party of the 2nd King’s African Rifles at R&amp;rgeisa under Eeiut.

Eventually, v/hen the Trenchmen cajue on again from T)jibouti they proceeded some 50 miles to what was then railhead, and then left trie train, comin via the Gadabursi country to Eobolek, 20 miles west of Hargeisajf Our camelry patrols had given warning and the detach- ent 2nd K.A.R. was ready o meet and arrest the French Caravan which included 40 Soudanese Askarias .

I arrived at Rargeisa a day or two later and conducted an enquiry which shewed that the French non had intentions of proceeding across the Kaud to the ;ull h. They could not have done so however, as their Camels ware used ux^, and they had uia e no provision to cross the water- le&gt;.s uaud. I eventually sent the 40 Soudanese under a Camel Corps escort to Zeyla and thence to 7)jiboulii, and I personally convey d the Frenchmen undsr escort to Bulhar and thance by dhow to Zeyla and Djibouti, where I handed them over to the Governor ’par interim*.The interesting pert of the affair was that it was proved that the Ooventor, whilst inforaing Colonel Sadler of the de parture of the 'Adventurers' had himself registered the names of the oudanese and had lent his Railv/ay carriage to Mens. Manotto and his party, -'ons. Manotte assured me that the Covarmor, Judging from his own limitations, had no idea that the British could arrest any one even 5 miles from the Coast, ana it v/as for this reason that he had thought it safe to give ue information and yo cover himself.

' The understanding entered into with the Italian Consulate only affects Dhows proceeding to the Italian Protectorate. On the 23rd June 1902, it was arranged hetween Captain Pottinger and the Italian Consul that such dhows should first call at Eais - a port in the British Protectorate,- for exaraination, &amp;c. The arrangement was that we should issue Port Clearances to such vessels upon the Italian Consul*s certificate that they had furnished security to him. In his No.188, dated 2nd July 1902,the Political Resident remarked, that there were grounds for supposing, that certain dhows had been evading our rules by sailing for ports in the Italian Protectorate and thence sending their cargoes overland to British Somaliland. He pointed out that the Italian Government had no regular port on their coast where dhows could be inspect ed as they were at Berbera, Karam and Hais in our protectorate. He said that the Italian Consul had readily promised to ad dress his Government with a view to esta blishing of such a port at Bunder Kassim and had meanwhile agreed that Mijjertein dhows bound for their own country should be made to give security to the Italian Con- —41 sulateConsulate that they would touch first at Trais to show their papers &amp;c: the Nakhuda of each dhow being supplied with a certifi cate signed by the Italian Consul General to the effect that they had given the re quisite security. It was understood and later in the Italian Consult letter of 1st December 1902, formally agreed that H the Mijjertein coast should be subject to the local rules for the traffic of sambuks in the Gulf of Aden”, that is to say, that Mijjertein dhows should, as all other dhows leaving or arriv ing at the Port of Aden, be subject to the provisions of Regulation III of 1902 and rules framed there under. As a matter of fact, of course, Regul ation III should have been modified accord ingly to include the Mijjertein coast. It was not and it follows, I think, that no prosecution is possible under Regulation III for breach of any of the provisions of that Regulation affecting the Mijjertein coast only. As far as that coast is con cerned the only means of enforcing compli ance with local rules lay in the security bonds furnished to the Italian Consulate which the Italian Consul could presumably forfeit in the event of a breach of its terms being proved to his satisfactin*. But as far as the coast of British Somaliland vast of Berbera and places on the Arabian coast of the Gulf of Aden are concerned, local rules can, of course, be enforcedenforced and prosecutions where necessary conducted under the Regulation III of all dhows, Mijjerten as well as others* Of a dhow touche/ at one of our ports she is bound by our rules whether she is proceed ing elsewhere or not. Dhows visiting Bri tish Somaliland at all are bound by our rules to call at certain prescribed ports and not to proceed from that or other ports in British Somaliland without the permission of the proper/ authority at the prescribed port. Such dhows should be bound over before they leave Aden under seuki°*i 3 of the Regulation and on their re burn should be dealt with, if necessary under Section 4(2), The mere fact of their touching at Italian ports after visiting British ports cannot be held to free them from this li ability. In that case the/ Regulation would be useless. Further it was as above pointed out the obvious intention of the Italian Consul in 1902 that the Mijjerten Coast should be treated as under our rules. And there is jjhere fore no claim on the part of Italy that their ports should be allowed to be a place of refuge for evasion of our rules &amp;c. On the 9th January 1903, I see that Colonel Ashby informed the Italian Consul that the understanding as to security being furnished to him only affected dhows pro ceeding to the Mijjerten Coast and pointed out that dhows proceeding to Mo kaila and thethe Arabian Coast should of course furnish security direct to us. It is of course equally clear that dhows proceeding to British Somaliland, east of Berbera, should also furnish security direct to us. Since the understanding above referred to was arrived at the only modification^ has been that, in October of 1903, a port,Bunder Kasim actually was established by the Ita lian authorities on the Mijjerten Coast. This, accordingly for Italian dhows,took the place of Hais. Bunder Kasim in fact became for Italian Somaliland a prescribed port like Berbera, Karam and Hais are for British Somaliland. Upon this being effectdd there was still more cause for Regulation III to be so modified as to include Italian Somali land. This was not, however, done. In his letter dated 27th October 1903, Signor Olivio simply said that it was agreed that henceforth dhows intending to deal with the ports of Italian Somaliland should first call at Bunder Kasim and should not be allowed to leave Aden until their papers had been Signed by the Italian Consular authorities. He did not say until they had© furnished security to first call at Bunder Kasim &amp;c* But that, of course, was part of the former understanding and re mained. It should have been simplified. On the 28th October, the Italian Consul was asiced whe uher he wished all dhows proceeding ^o Italian Somaliland to have their papers visedvised at his Consulate or only Mijjerten dhows. Ho answer appears to have been received to this. There was scope for a d ‘fuller understaning. As to Port Clearances we only can furnish them in Aden. It is our Port and we only can certify that all our regulations have been complied with. Those now furnish ed by the Italian Consulate are out of order. Under the understanding arrived at the proper procedure should be that in the case of vessels manifested for Italian ports our Clearances should be juso vised by the Italian Consul before I sign them and that they should also be accompanied by a certificate of any security which they have furnished to the Italian Consulate. It would seem most convenient that a copy ■ of the security bond which should be framed on the lines of ours should be attached. It would be more convenient still as I have already implied if the Italian Somali Uoast were just included in our Regulatin and the security was furnished -to us. There would then be no legal difficulty about forfeit ing the bond if necessary, which there might otherwise be. And we could further prosecute under our Regulation III and give really practical effect to the desire of the Italian Consul to co-operate with us in the suppression of the illicit traffic in arms and of smuggling generally. We could go further and add a clause in the Regulation providing under certain circumstances to prohibit visits to certainf\v£) j ports or places under penalty of forfeiture of Bond or prosecution. And we 3mve recent ly been given to understand that the Bri tish and Italian Commissioners of Somali land desire action to be occasionally taken in this direction. Our understanding with the Italian Consul should if possible clearly include some provision in regard to Italian Somali land similar to those contained in Section 4 (2) (3) of Regulation III. In the absence of written permission from Bunder Kasim dhows should be liable to penalty for de parture from that or other ports. Aden, 20-12-05.j Sd/- P. de B. Hancock, Capt, Ag. 1st Assistant Resident.NOTES of INTERVIEW, Cormnedatore Pestalozza called on me this morning zo discuss the case of Makhuda Mahood Arrlay and also my Minute dated 20th Instant. - 2. As to Nakhuda Mahmood he stated that papers were furnished to him on the 13th June last hut that he nad not heen called upon to furnish any security to first visit any parti cular prescribed port. He said that for some time past the practice of taking security dm accordance with the understanding arrived at in 1902 to generally conform with our rules on the subject had been discontinued. He was inclined to urge that the undertaking to conform with our rules had lapsed when Bander Kasim was established as the prescribed port for Italian Somali land. But I pointed out that there seemed to be no good reason to presume this. And he did not press the point. 3. On the other hand, he said, that just lately the pra tice of taking security had been Revived. But it transpired that the security demanded was not based upon our jlocal rule of Rs.10/- per ton, subject to a minimum charge of Rs.100/- but did not in any case exceed Rs.100/- Further, either the Rs.100/ itself was taken as security or else one single surety was taken. In reply to my questions the Commendatore said that this surety was generally a British subject, and some individual more or less guaranteed by the Police. I further gathered that the security was, as often as not, not taken at all. 4. COMM. Pestalozza agreed that there might be difficulti es about enforcing forfeiture of the bond. He had never had to do so yet. The bonds were taken more by way of a show of res traint than with any actual ultimate intention of forfeiting them, if the terms were infringed. 5 He was inclined to agree that it would be better ifthe bonds were taken by me as other bonds and if the Italian Coast were covered by our regulation altogether* But this, he said, was a matter which he would have to carefully consider and to refer to Roma* 6* It transpired in the course of the interview that the control actually exercised by the Italian Government at Bander Ka,sim was slight and that at times when the dhows, whose oxficer were the only representatives of the Italian Government on the Somali Coast, were elsewhere engaged, actually non-existenfcs Comm* Pestalozza hoped that in due course a more effectual control would be established including a regular place of official residence for himself, the Commissioner of Italian Somaliland* He hoped that this would be established also over Ras Alula as well as Bander Kasim. 7. Meanwhile,he was inclined to think that too drastic enforcement of our rules, might injuriously affect the trade of Aden. Even now, he said, that an increasing number of Mijjertein dhows plied between their own ports and Mokalla instead of coming to Aden. I admitted that this might certainly be the case but that, with the main object of checking illicit traffic in arms in view, it was desirable that as much as pos« sible of the littoral should be included in our mutual arrange ments. Mokalla, I pointed out, might be included in our arrangements as a prescribed port. And I thought that this might possibly be done hereafter. 8. I pointed out that if prescribed ports were arranged at Perim, Aden, Shugra, Bala&amp;af and Mokalla, an effective con trol could be exercised over the coasts of South West Arabia and that similar measures were desirable from Berbera right round to Illig. He agreed in principle. 9. Meanwhile it was evidently clear to him that under present arrangements, the portsof Italian Somaliland were favourably situated as compared to the ports of -pritish Somali landland, in that dhows could go there either without a security bond or with a comparatively light one. This was an advantage M which was not apparently inclined to give up for the mere purpose of co-operating with us to check the illicit traffic in arms. He remarked however that he would discuss the matter witn the Mijjerten Sultan and think over it and that he did think that it was desirable that we should co-operate heartily together. 10. He pointed out that it was actually some trouble to Uakhudas to furnish requisite security to me. I said that I was sparing no effort to make this simpler and less trouble. 11. He agreed that he had no authority to issue a port clearance for the port of Aden and that the present form used at his Consulate was irregular and unnecessary. It really was only intended to be a bill of health. He agreed that it might be convenient if he vised Port Clearances instead of furnish ing these forms. He pointed out that recently he had stated on these forms that guarantees (security) had been furnished. He could do the same on the Port Clearnce form itself if de sired. I suggested that the form used at his Consulate might be so ?3iodified as to include- (a) reference to the health of the port; (b) reference go the fact that security had been furnished As a mau oer 01 . fact I added Lhat there seemed no reason why he should not use security forms similar to ours. I said I would make out some sample forms for his consideration. 12. He said that Italian vessels had other papers which they had to get from him before sailing. I replied that doubt less that was the case wherever they might be proceeding but that it did not affect the present question. He agreed. 13. It should I think be here noted that under present circumstances Italian Somaliland scores a material advantage over British Somaliland in the laxity with which this matter is treatedtreated* Further our Regulation III of 1902 must clearly fail of any real effect unless and until the Italian authorities more fully co-operate* If it is of any real interest to us to keep arms out of Somaliland then a fuller co-operation should he pressed lor at once. 14. Incidentally it might here he noted that a more ef'set ive control over the Coast to the north-west of Aden including; arrangements to make Perim and Ras-al-Arah or some other port prescribed ports would have considerable effect^ in the desired direction irrespective of Italian co-operation. 15. As to French co-operation Comm. Pestalozza said that the French authorities would he found apparently most friendly and inclined to assist. They had rules which nominally pro hibited illicit traffic. But in effect arms were sold to Arabs and by Arabs to Somalis, and eventually found their way out of Jibouti or Tajourah Bay in small consignments which as often as not were conveyed by Dunkali on Somali fishing or pearl-diving boats. He agreed that if they could only be got to co-operate in the directim of only recognizing certain prescribed ports, that might be useful. 16. He agreed in effect that it was desirable for Great Britain, Italy, France and Turkey to co-operate in the matter of checking illicit traffic in arms in Somaliland. 17. Reverting to the case of Hakhuda Mahmood he said that he had explained that he had been unable to make the port of Hais owing to stress of weather. !Dn regard to the goods which he had landed at Maith he said, that the merchants concerned had assured him that hey would pay the necessary dues on them at Hais. I pointed out that this was rather an improbable story (Signed) F. de B. Hancock, Captain, Ag.

During thQ Political RoBident S recent Tistt to Berbera and Jibouti 2nd to 8th Instant, I had an oppor tunity of discussing this subject with General Swayne and Captain Cordoaux and of seeing certain of the Somali land Protectorate records on the sub ject, which Captain Cordeaux kindly showed no at Berbora. 2* As to dhows, I gathered that the initial cost of purchasing, fitting out, arming, and thoroughly equlppi g a good dhow was about £ 500, or even a little more. I gathered that the best way to set about the matter was to purchase a good dhow of suitable typo at HodoIda, where alone they were made. This then should bo fitted up and specially strengthened with a view to carrying the requisite armament of a three-pounder Hotchkiss gun, and accommodating com .ander and crjw &amp;c. 3. The actual dhow could, I gathered, be purchased for about Rs. 1500/» to 2000/- and could be strength enedanod and fitted out for about another Rs.SOO/- 0ver and above this,However, there are various items to be taken into account which bring the to tal initial co? 3 t j*p to about the figure named. There are such items as the followirg;- (i) . 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun and am munition &amp;c. (ii) .Special Water-tanks. (iiD.Good telescope and compass. (it ). Medicine chest and first aid appliances. (v) . Cooking stoves &amp;c. (vi) . Flags - Awnings. (vii) . Admiralty Charts. (viii). Log Books. (ix) . Uniforms for Commander and crew. (x) . Arms for police. (xi) .Filter. (xii) . Furniture. (xlii). Special steering gear. (xiv). Special fittings to provide suitable shelter and accommodat ion to European Co mander &amp;c. Various other minor requirements doubtless exist or come to notice in the course of actual service. 4. Anyhow I gathered that though Captain Cordeaux estimated the initial cost of an armed-dhow at only about £ 200 in August 1902^ subsequent ex perience has proved that including armament and all other items £ 500 may-be taken as a more probable figure. 5. As to the cost of upkeep the attached copy of last year’s Somali land Protectorate estimate::® furnishes information. Petty supplies and re pairs may be taken at about Rs.900 to Ps.lOOO. The rations and victuals of two European employeesa day for Europeansjand 12 Natives may be estimated at about Rs.2500/- a year. As to establishment the following is maintained in Somaliland:*' 1 aster .•• ••• 150-0-0 1 Mate • • • «• • 80-0-0 1 Interpreter ... 50-0-0 1 Serang ••• .*• 20-0-0 4 Khalas^ ® 13/*. 52-0-0 1 Boy ... • •• 7-0-0 1 Sergeant Police 22-0-0 4 Policemen ® 16/* 64-0-0 Rs .445-0-0 mensem = R*.5340/- per annum. With a view to having a master of superior standing in the which I am inclined to consider a matter of very f-reat importance. I would add another Rs.200/- por mensem on this account i.e. another Rs.2400 per annum. I should be inclined to estimate Rs. 8000/- per annum on account of esta blishment and that brings the total vost of upkeep per dhow to about Rs. h 11,500 which is a more liberal estimate than that made by Somaliland.6. As to tho cost of a steamer - tliis is of course entirely depends upon the ty^e of Tassel required. A good stout steam tug with the plainest possible fittings could he probably had from £ 6000 to £ 7000. The tug ''Dolphin* owned by the Aden Port Trust M i ) cost £ 6550. The tug Hornet freipiently used by the Perim Coal Company to convey the mails between Aden and Herim cost about a 2750# * • - But. both these are small for work in the open sea and not really safe in rough weather. And they have not sufficient accommodation for either men or bag gage to be really useful. 7. The Commissioner of Somali land has had a fairly long correspond ence upon the subject of a suitable steamer and tho attached copy of a letter from the Naval Architect and f, • Inspecting Engineer Mr. g.^BQQd, dated 14th -vrarch 1905 is instructive on the subject. It may be taken for granted that a 12 knot speed and a fairly shallow draft referential requirements. Aden being already provided with a vessel of the R.I.M. the Revenue Reamers need not contain the same acco Tmodation for men and cargo as is apparently necessary fer Somaliland. They should be large enough to accom modate about 50 souls all told and about 50 tons of cargo. Sepoys and camp equipage would be occasionally conveyedconyeyed.• There should be accommodut* ion for two or three European passengers. 8. It has heon su^ested that mails should he convoyed. Against ‘tnis it may he urged that the present service is fairly regular and that the employ ment of either steamer or dhow on this soryice would to some extent c t Uf3® an interruption to thoir other duties and also impair hhe general efficiency of the protective service in that tho opportunity afforded hy any regular absence on mail service would not im probably be taken to commit offences. 9. On the other hand the trip between Aden and nerim does not take long. The distcjice is only 9 g miles which at 12 knots an hour makes the journey one of about 8 hours only. 10. Upon the whole a sum of about £ 10,000 may perhaps be estimated as the cost of a suitable steamer for the preventive service. But in the light of Captain Cordouax’s experience in the matter of the dhows and tak .ng it that the steamer/ should be ar ied with one or more three-pounder and perhaps a gmxdbftXK maxim gun as well, it would seem safer to add another thousand pounds or two to the estimate which one might therefore put at £ 12,000. 11.

SOMALI 87. Garth omen, Haying carefully examined the letters and enclosures relating to a proposed steamer for the Somaliland Protectorate which accompanied your communication of 16th February on the subject, I beg 1 iave to report as follovs:- Zm The requirements necessary for the steamer as enuiter* ated by General Swayx© require a larger vessel than has apparent ly been contemplated, and it is to be observed that neither of the three steamers of which the particulars are enclosed with the correspondence would offer anything approaching the com bination of qualities required, even if the age of the two larger ones did not preclude them from favourable consideration. A similar remark would apply to a converted Borth Sea fishing steamer which would not have the required carg-carrying pow r and speed, and would be capable of affording but limited accom modation. 3. The size and style of the steamer referred to in iressrs Cochrane an# Sons letter to Messrs C.W. Kellock a d Company would be altogether inadequate for the pur ose in view. She • ould not be well constructed, would carry little cargo and would have a low speed. I can readily believe that even under these circumstances the price quoted for this vessel allows a very small margin of profit although the cost of construction is cut do ,n to the lo /©st possible limit, and I am afraid that t’nis price, in the absence of particulars as to her cargo- carrying power and speed has proved misleading when the probale cost of a vessel combining the desired requirements has been under consideration. Few persons who are not closely acquainted with such investigations understand how ^reatly the cost is increased by requiring so large a proportionate weight of cargo toto be carried in combination with such a speed as 12 knots when loaded, from t is point of view offers for boats carrying little car£O f or none at all, are most misleading. „ 4. I h ve prepared a d enclose here ith an outline sketch of a steamer, in w v ich I have combined the requirements mention ed by General ^wayne as far as can be done in a vessel of moderate size and cost, but I have found it necessary, even in this boat, to reduce tbe deadweight of cargo to be carried and to adopt a lower speed and even with these reductions the steamers will cost consider bly more than the sum of £9,000 mentioned. 5. This proposed vessel has a length of 160 feet between perpendiculars, an extreme breadth/ of 27 feet and 11 feet moulded depth. On the draught of 8 feet she will be capable of ca Tying a total deadweight of coal and cargo of a’ out 230 tons. She will have speed of 11 knots per hour when loaded to 8 feet draught. I have found it necessary to adopt twin screw machinery in order to obtain a sufficient i mansion of the pro pellers, because a single screw would require to be of excess ive diameter in proportion to the limited draught. The bunkers provided have a capacity for about 100 tons of coal, which quantity I calculate will be ample for 2,000 miles steaming. T The total carrying power of the vessel on a draught of 8 feet being 230 tons, the weight of cargo which can be carried when the bunkers are Ihill is therefore only 130 to s* It is to be observed, however, that a greater wei ht of cargo could be carried without increas ng the draught at any time when cir cumstances do not require the bunkers to be full, because the holds are of ample size, the forward hold having a capacity for about 147 tons of cargo, reckoned at 50 cubic feet to the ton, and the after one for about 89 tons, or a total of 236 tons. I may also remark that if at any time it should not be necessary to strictly limit the draught of the vessel to 8 feet, a larger total deadweight than 230 tons of coal and cargo together could be carried, the freesboard as designed being quite sufficient to allow of her bei g safely immersed 6 inches or even 9 inches more,~Y more, each inch increasing th weight-carrying power by about 7^ tons. 6. I have been obliged to limit the speed of the vessel to 11 knots because the adoption of the 12 knots speed mentioned by General Sv/ayne would have caried the design still further away from the siate and cost of the vessel which he seems to consider would suffice to embody his requirements. To obtain a speed of 12 knots per hour with the same total deadweight of 230 tons on a draught of 8 feet, it would be necessary to in crease the length of the vessel I have proposed by nearly 10 feet and her breadth by 1 foot, and to increase the power and weight of the machinery by about 80 per cent. The coal con sumption also would necessarily be somewhat increased and the cargo-carrying power correspondingly reduced. 7. I have arranged for the accommodation of the Commis sioner and his staff by the provision of a teak deck house on the after part of the upper deck. This house will contain a large saloon, with a pantry adjacent a sleeping cabin, bath room and W.C, for the Commissioner, three double berth cabins, a bath room and a W.C. for the staff and a steward’s store room. The whole of the after part of the upper deck will be sheltered by an av\®ing, with side screens fitted down oo th© height of the bulwarks. 8. The accommodation for the ships officers comprises a captain’s cabin on the bridge deck, adjo ning a chart and heel house, add side babins for the other officers beneath the bridge deck. The crew will be berthed under a raised forecastle. 9 No indication is given as to any special accommodat- £ ion being desired for the deck passengers, and I have assumed that deck space, with the necessary latrine arrangements, is all that will be required. To give shelter to these passengers, I have arranged for the forecastle deck to be continued as far as the bridge , the space on top of this deck being also available for the accommodation of passengers. The space on the upper deck forward will be protected at the sides by canvas screens a-d awnings will be fitted over the bridge and shelter decks. TheTho number of deck passengers ich can be carried at any given time will naturally depend to some extent on the length of the voyage and other conditions prevailing at the time* 10. The vesel vessel will be fitted with tv/o steam winches for v/orking the cargo by means of derricks placed on the masts. She will be provided with sttjam steering gear, and a steam wind lass will be fitted forward for working the anchors^ which will be of the stockless typo stowing in the hawsepipes. I have assumed that a vessel of this size and character would natural ly be j^r-ovidod with a complete electric light installation, including deck reflectors fo* working cargo at night, and I have included this in the design. 11. The arrangements for mounting the Hotchkiss gun refer- r d to in general Swayne’s despatch, the provision of racks for the rifles which it is intended to carry, and the fitting of magazines for the ammunition are details which may be left for future consideration as to the manner in which they shall be cair led out. 12. The machinery I propose/ for this vessel consists of twin screw triple expansion engines, of th j type/ e# usually fitted in merchant steamers, this type being well adapted for working well for long periods, while it is also moderate in cost. Steam would be supplied by tv/o single-ended cylindrical return tube boilers, the working pressure being about 160 lbs. The feecessary fee d and donkey pumps would be fitted and the usual engine room outfit and a moderate amount of spare gear would be provid d. 13. The hull of the vessel would be constructed generally in accordance with Ilojds rules and the wood decks v/ould be of teak, this being by far the most suitable wood for a hot cli ate although its employment involves considerable increase of cost. The fittings generally would be of as good quality as could be obtained without incurring unnecessary expense. 14. notwithstanding the fact already stated that the v r sol would fall short of th &gt; qualifications enumerated both in speed and cargo-carrying capacity, and possibly also in the numbernumber of deck passengers which could be accommodated, the cost of such a Tassel as described above, cannot, I am afraid, be estimated at much less than £ 14,000 exclusive of the cost cf navigation go the Protectorate. It would of course be possible to monewh t reduce this cost by the omddsion of the electric light installatim, the substitution of pitchpine for the teak decks, the fitting of hand steering gear and a hand windlass instead of steam, and generally by fitting the vessel ir a cheap manner, such as is frequently adopted in snail cargo steamers of the mercantile marine. The cost of the vessel might be reduced by about £1,200 or £ 1,500 by these means, but I am convinced that a vessel so fitted would not be desirable for the intended service nor prove satisfactory to the Author ities. In no case could the cost of s*tch a vessel be brought down to anything approaching the sum of £ 9,000 allotted for her construction. 15. As it is posrlble that the expenditure on the pro- posed voesel 1 b strictly Halted to this aura of £ 9,000, I have furthered- considered what kind of vea B ol mlpht be obtained for that amount. I find that the diraens lens of the largest teasel which c&lt;u Id reasonably be expected would be about 115 f eet x 20 feet, with a moulded depth of 10 feet. This vaaael would have single ecrew eorapound engine., driving her at a speed of 10 knot, per hopr. Her weight-carrying capacity on a draught of 8 feet would be about 120 ton., of which 60 ton. would be retired fer the quantity of coal necessary to .ten 2,000 raile., leaving 60 ton. for cargo. The relative proportion, of coal and cargo might, however, be somewhat varried as in the case of the larger .termer, and about 25 ton. more total dead weight raight safely be carried when there is no necessity to limit the draught to 8 feet. The cargo would bo stowed in two hold, each with a steam winch for loading and discharging by *# means of derricks. 16. The aoooramodatlam for the eommls.ioner and his staff ii v ha laBB extensive than in the larger vessel, would necessarily oe Itfould Ido containod under a poop deck and would comprise a modar ta sized salcon f a ale 3ping cabin for the Commissioner, two doubla-berth state rooms, a bath, room, W.C* and a pantry which is all that could be provided in the space available. The officers would be berthed in cabins under the bridge deck, and the crew in a rais d forecastle. The space available for deck passengers would be small and only about 40 to 50 of those could be carried. The amount of money allowed would not permit of electric light being fitted and in order to keep the cost within the specified limit it might possibly be necessary to fit hand steering gear and a hand windlass instead of steam. 17. It will be seen that this smaller vessel is very far indeed from complying with the requirements enumerated by $enor- al Swayna, in speed, ear go -carrying capacity and passenger accommodation. On the other hand, the larger vessel I have described which much more nearly fulfils these requirements would be more costly than has been anticipated, and under these circumstances I beg leave to wait for further instructions befor^ undertaking the work of preparing a detailed specifica ion. 18.

The object of the Revenue Cutters is to enforce the Rro- tectorata Custom* Regulation*, and also to prevent fire-arms an l awraunition from being imported at any place on the coast of the Protectorate. The Regulations require that all dhows trading with Bri tish Somali ^orts must first *all at one of the Protectorate Customs Stations, namely, Zaila, Bulhar, Berhora, Karam, or 05 !Tais &gt;A must obtain therefrom written permits to proceed to their destination. Every dhow sighted is to be boarded and searched. If more than one dhow is sighted, the one nearest to the land should be boarded iirst ii possible} but the respective positions of the dhows with regard to the dir ction of the wind should be con sidered. It might be advisable to board dhows to windward be- On a dhow being sighted, the armed portion of the crew should be kept down out of sight until within hailing dis tance. When nearer enough, the ensign is to be hoisted, and the officers and men show themselves with rifles in hand, the Interpreter hailing the dhow to heave to. If *keae- this should have no effect, a blank charge from the 3-poundor is to be fired, followed if necessary by a shot across the bows. If these measures are insufficient to stop the dhow, fire should be opened with a view to bringing dovn her mast or sail. Blood shed should be avoided as far as possible. On the dhow being brought to, the Mate and Interpreter should board her in a boat manned by two of the Protectotate crew, the Captain and remainder of the crew covering them with CUSTOPiS REGULATIONS HI.

EXAHIMTIOH OP PAP IBS * Thj papers of each dhow hoarded are to he carefully examin' ed and compared with, the position of the dhow at the time* In ^ the case of any discrepancy or irrcgularity f or if the permit mentioned in Rule II cannot he shov&lt;n, the papers are to he re tailed and handed over to the Chief Customs Officer on return to Rerherai together with a report of the circumstances. VI. SEARCH Every dhow must he carefully and thoroughly searched. Gun- running dhows conceal arms under the cargo and between false sides or bottoms; arx in water-tight casoe are alsd slung by ropes over the ship’s cide^f or under the keel, ready to ho slipped instantly in case of danger. When possible they are dropped in shallow water, to he recovered afterwards. All these tricks should he looked out for. VII. VREECH EHOW^ Dhows with Erench colours found v/ithin three miles of the British Protector ,te shore,are to he called upon to show their papers, and if these ar: correct, allowed to proceed without being searched. If their papers are incorrect, they are to he ordered to leave the coast, and inforned of the Regulations referred to in Rule II. Ho dhow under French colours is to he searched unless there is the strongest reason to believe she is carry ng anas. If she is fo-md to he so doing, she is to he dealt with as other dhows so captured, that is to say, conveyed to the nearest port where there are civil authorities, to whom they are to he turned over* VIII. EIRIHG TO BE AVOIDED. The firing of the 3-pounder guns should not he resorted to unless absolutely necessary, as the sound would put other dhows in the neighbourhood on their guard. It must he no^ne in mind that the intention is to taka dhows by surprise, and with this object every care must he taken to render the Protectorate dhows as little oonspicous as possible. Colours should only ho hoisted when 'within hailing distanc ? of the dhow to he hoardedIX * Q' CMPTAIim A'~~) HATSS . Eie Captain will be responsible for h s ship and her arma ment; the Hate will have charg# of provisions, water, and mis cellaneous stores. They will keep a list of stores for which they are eei*re- severally responsible, and show the daily ex penditure therein. All indents tor stores will be submitted monthly, as re- quirud, trrouyh the Chief of Customs, B orb era, wbo will inspect the ship * s books at the termination of each cruise and see that t-ep are correct and written up to date.

The Captain will also keep a daily Log and Boarding Book, in which will be enter d the required details of all dhows boarded, and will forward it to the Consul-General, through the Chief of Cub toms, immediately on return from a cruise. X. PRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED. *'*' .. All arms and ammunition should be kept securely under lock nd key, but should be stowed in such a ma ner as to be in ins tant readiness when required. A watch is always to be kept, and precautions are to be taken against surprise by hostile natives. No attempt should be made to obtain water in Italian ter ritory, ar at places vhere the natives snow signs of unfriend liness, and the watering party should be under cover of the ship or an ar ied party. Hostilities are always to be avoided if possible, and friendly relati) ns maintained with the Coast tribes. XI. HEALTH OX THE CHEW The health of the crew is to be cared for by all means possible, and special precautions should be taken as regards drinking-water. All drinking-water should be first boiled, and then filter ed, Each dhow is supplied with a filter for this purpose. A medicine chest containiag simple remedies is also suppli ed and should bo re-stocked at the end of each cruise.

I enclose a copy 0 f my letter herewith, which practic ally embodies my views on the questions raised a d Captain Cordeaux f a reply, ho has also forwarded to me a copy of his report to the Foreign Office, with wMch I concur generally. I obs rve that it appears to be in contemplation to employ only two Europeans in each dhow, the remainder of the crow being natives, some of whom I understmd, are police and these would I assume, be armed. It is open to question whether so small a percentage o_ Europeans v/ould be sufficient in a case of armed resistence being offered by a dhow carry ng arms or slaves, and it may be found desirable to increase this proportion. I ! *c, tnafc in providi g for the acco lodaticn of the Europeans on board the dhows, this point should not be lost si r ht of. As regards the arms traffic generally, it can no ocubt be kept somewhat in check by the use of armed dhows, but until it becomes possible to establish Gust ns posts not only on the Somaliland Protectorate coast but also the South Coast of Arabia, it /ould appear impossible to stop, to ctny groat extent, such a lucrative trade. I have Sec. (Signed) R.R. Farquhar, Capt in Sc Senior Faval Officer, Aden. The Secretary, to the Admiralty, Whitehall, LondonH.M.S. 'IFTKEPID' at ADEN 13th May 1903* Sir:- I have the honour to inform you that I have received from the Admiralty a copy of a communication from the foreign Office, dated let April, requesting information as to the conditions on w' ich crews could he engaged for tho two dhows to he employed in the suppression of the traffic in arms on the Somali Coast. Their Lordships instruct me to furnish the local officers v/ho are engaged or. the duty of find! g crews for these vessels, with such information on the point raised as I may he able to obtain. Also to forward to the Admiralty a report for trans mission to the Secretary of Ctata. As I understand you are the principal local officer refer red to, I should be glad to know in v/h .t manner 1 can hast assist and advise in the matter. The points raised by the Crown Agents for the Colonies appear to be:- 1st. On v.hat condition the engagement of two European Of ficers for each dhow (in lieu of t' a fetty Officers at present serving in them) should he based. 2nd. Whether it would he necessary to give free quarters on shore to the men to he engaged. 3rd. Whether ho rd and outfit aliowaneas should be iven. 4th. (and lastly). Whether it ould he advisable that they should be provided with uniform. As re/* rds the latter ioirt, I understand that the success ful operations of the dhows depend largely on their power of approaching native craft without arousing suspicion. *yrom this point of view the wearing of distinctive uni form would probably he inadvisable.* An extract from Somaliland Regulation &gt;!o.l696 Appts. is appended to the papers, dated 7th April 1903, raising the same points. As4. A« a preliminary, I sent for Lieutenant Commander Kirwin, Commanding Torpedo Boat No. 104, and obtained from him a des- critpion of the dhow which he commanded for a'bout three m rths last autumn, and generally of the life of an officer on board a dhow together with suggestions as to how far the rough mode of liYing &amp;c., on that sonrice might be ameliorated. The conclusions which I drew from his report (verbal) are, briefly, as follows:- 1. The ordinary trading dhow is built without much regard to the comfort and accommodation of the Captain or crew, and considerable, though not necessarily expensive, alteratio s must be undertaken in converting such a vessel, mainly adapted as it is for carrying cargo, into a fighting craft. 2. If it is considered impracticable to have dhows specially built for this service, the alterations required would be somewhat as follows:- a. The rudder to be worked by a hand wheel fitted near the break of the poop, which would thus be left clear c. ; accommodations of the officers. b. A small folding table and folding chairs (very in- expe sive) supplied, also bed boards, i.e. pieces of plank t© ship and unship on the deck to form the sides of the beds or hunks at night, to mitigate the discomfort attendant on heavy rolling at anchor, &amp;c. c. The after part of the main hold or«well«, to be board ed over and fitted with lockers for the European crews (if any). d. Iron water tanks and suitable store-rooms, magazines, arm—racks &amp;c to be fi ted. e. aood rain and sun awnings to be supplied. 3. There appears to me to be no reason why European Officers should not be able to live on board, provided that reasonable arrangements can be made for their comfort, but if the dhow should be hauled up or 'hove down* for repairs, refit, repainting, &amp;c., they should be permitted to live on shore, receiving suitable subsistence allowance.4. Each, dhow should have a serviceable boat, about 12 to 15 foot long, for boarding and landing purposes, and capable of laying out a spare anchor. 5. The officers should, in my opinion, certainly poa~ sees uniform, and should wear it on such occasions as require it, e.g. when boarded by a man-of-war, p.ritish or Eoreign, interviewing the head man of a tribe, visiting officials or landing in a tribal port, &amp;c. 6. If there are Euro^ans included in the crew, they also should have uniform/. The native crew do not require uniforms. 7. As to the composition of the crew I should think from your knowledge of the native races in this part of the world you would know what is best to be done, but I understand that Somalis are not altogether satisfactory. 8. To conclude: as this is the beginning of what may be re arded as a Coast Guard service, it is desirable to get started in a gdd groove, so to speak, and when Somaliland is once more peacefully settled, the revenues from this sourse ought to be hands me. The scale on which the present Egyptian Coast Guard was ■ anfced started was, I imagine, quite a small one It is now, as perhaps you are aware, one of the most efficient and well organised services to bcs found anywhere, and the personas! are native, with a proportion of European officers (British subjects). 9. I shall await your reply before sedding in the report required by the Admiralty. In the meantime please confer with Commander Cartwright and any other Naval Officers at Borbera, who will, I am sure, assist you in every way they can. I have etc., (Signed) R.B.

Inquiries on the same subject have already been addressed to me by His Majesty's Secretary of State, and I enclose a copy of my reply for your information. I should however be 'lad to learn your viown on the special points on which inf ©matin is asked for, and you will doubtless communicate direct with the Lords Commissioners of the *d iralty on the subject. I have also to thank you fcr your useful suggestions on the fitting out of the dhows. The majority of these have al ready been anticipated, and the two dhows have recently returned from a cruise and are sailing in a few days for a second patrol of the coast line as far as Bandar Elayia. Experience will doubtless bting to light many points in which alterations and additions can be made to advantage, and in carrying these out your suggestions will be a valuable guide.

Mason Political Resident, Aden To, The Secretary to Government, Political -nepartment, Bombay Sir, In reference to your letter No.2107, dated the 31st March last regarding the illicit importance of arms and am munition into t e Aden Protectorate, I have the honour to now submit the following remarks for the consideration of Government 2. The latest instructions of Government in regard to the supply of arms and ammunition to the Chiefs of this Pro tectorate may be summarised as follows:- (i) The Political Resident may recommend to Government the presentation of rifies of Government bore except those taking .303 ammunition, to Chiefs of this Protectorate for s special reasons. (ii) . The Political Resident is authorised to himself pre To the marginally noted he may similarly present ammunition To other tribes such presentations shall be limited to 100 A--Presentation Abdali Padthli Ki shn and Socotra Shehr and Mokalla. sent the marginally noted Chiefs I | with ammunition for such rifles to I the i extent of 250/- rounds on one occasion up to a limit of 750.rounds in a year. to the extent of 200 rounds on one occasion up to Haushabi : Amiri : a limit of 600 rounds in a year. atat a time and 300 in the year, B—Supply . The Political Resident may issue on payment to the Chiefs of this protectorate rifles of Government lore other than those taking ,303 ammunition, and a reasonable quantity of ammunition. Statements of such issues should he forwarded to Government, Indents should he freely supplied so as to create the feeling in the minds of the Chiefs concerned that it is not worth while to go to Jihouti for their supply of arms with the chance of capture on the way hack when they can get all the rifles they want of at least as good quality without risk at our Arsenal. C--Exch nge . It is suggested that arms seized in the course of illicit traffic by the Chiefs of this Protectorate should he exchanged for other weapons of Government bore with a view to inducing Chiefs to interest themselves in making seizures, /. 3. This Residency is further asked to express an opinion as to whether it would he of use to work the guarding of the coast more energetically or whether the ship on the station might not he utilis ed for patrol purposes or, failing that, whether one or more dhows or a launch might not he fitted out for the work* 4. In your letter Ro.5023, dated the 11th August last it is held that arms captured in the course of illicit traffic should not he returned; it is admitted that particular cases may have speci 1 circumstances which render the general policy stated in your first quoted letter lTo.2107, dated the 31st March last undesirable. And it was stated that if there was any reason for doubting the Ahdali Sultan’s bone-fides in the matter of connivance in the illicit trade in arms it might he proball}' - undesirable to allow him the profit of the operation of that policy, 5, In your letter 110,3461, dated the 2nd June last this Residency© *1 Residency v/as asked to express an opinion on the provision of an amended Aden Sea Traffic in amis Regulations and to report whether any difficulty was experienced cy the Hinterland Chiefs in procuring arms via Yemen. 6. It has been partly owing to pressure of other work that a reply to these communications has been so long delayed but, the delay has also been due to the grave importance of the subject which rendered it desirable that the reply should be the result of particularly careful and mature consideration, $nd has also ben due to the desire to discuss the matter with both the Somaliland authorities and also if possible the French authorities at Djibouti before expressing any final opinion. 7. Colonel Scallcn discussed the subject with General Swayne before leaving Aden and has left certain notes on record and as it will be impossible for me to visit Jibouti for at least another month I have the honour to submit the following for the consideration of Government which I will supplement with a further report after visiting Jibouti, which I hope to be able to do on the return of the R.I.M.S. w Dalhousie n from Bombay next month. 8. At the outset I weald remark that this Protectorate is at the present moment full of rifles and ammunition which are chiefly of the Le Gras pattern and for the most part come from Jibouti. Captain Jacob, the Abdali Sultan, and the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla have all been addressed as to the supply of arms via Yemen and the general trend of their replies and of Other enquiries on the subject is to the effect that although arms in Yemen are fairly plentiful, comparatively few enter the limits of this Protectorate. The majority come from Jibouti via n Obokh M whence they are sent, frequently in small quantities at a time, either direct to the small coast ports or villages of this Protectorate or in some cases possibly via other coast ports in the vieihity of Mocka. It is probable that a large proportion of the arms sent to the coast ports near Mokha or elsewhere in Turkish limits areare locally used or disposed of, but a certain number doubtless find their way with passing caravans into the limits of this Protectorate and swell the number of those landed direct at cur ports. 9. The mainfacts which I desire to convey for the in formation of Government are that this Protectorate is already full of riles, that these as*© rifles are mainly of the Le Gras pattern, and that the main source of supply is Jibouti via the coast and not from the interior of Yemen. I would add that tie Le Gras rifle is much liked by the Arab. It is cheap and of convenient size and pattern and particularly suitable for the use of those v/ho ride on camels. It is obtained without much real difficulty. The Arabs seem to be able to reload the Le Gras cartridges two or three times v/hereas they fi d it dif ficult to reload the Martini Henry cartridge which more readily splits. As to the risk of obtaining supplies this is not at present any effective deterrent. 10. Within the limit of this Protectorate thus full of a cheap and popular weapon of precision, which is in the pos session not only of the armed follow rs of the more important Chiefs but of the majority of the tribesmen of even the most petty clan or sub-tribe who reside anywhere within a few days march of the coast, it is clear that the introduction of any other weapon and the successful carrying out of the general policy stated in yr. Hill^ letter under reference ho.2107, dated the 31st March 1905 must be a matter of considerable difficulty. 11. It is to be considered that with the single exception of the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla who keeps a small number of regular and moderately trained soldiers, the other Chiefs of this Protectora-fee at present possess no regular soldiery and have practically no limitations to the numbers of their standing armies, in which are practically included all inale members of the population capable of carrying arms and not otherwise engaged or preoccupied. In his address to His Excellency the Governor of Bombay ma&lt;fce in February 1903 the Abdali Sultan re presentedrepresented his requirements at 6000 artridges a month of ^ich he asked that 200 should he presented free. Over and above this he asked for an unlimited supply of lead and sulphar. 12. It will he remembered in reference t this demand that in your confidential No.6899, dated the 14th October 1903, you recalled the attention of this Residency to the fact that the Sultan conceived that he was doing us a service in Passing ammunition into Yemen, and from past and recent reports it must, I think, he clear to Government that the Abdali Sul.an*s com mercial instincts are at least as strong as his military in clinations and that he will not he slow to grasp any opportunity £ adding to his resources by a lively commerce in ann arms, \.i^i 'which he is as freely supplied as is contemplated in Mr. HirMs letter under reference. In the matter of exchange he would probably display particular activity. 13. Presupposing the introduction of a rifle which would prove more popular than the Le Gras it cannot, I fear, be hoped to introduce one which is as cheap. The price of the Le Gra# rifle varies roughly from about Rs.20/- to 25/- in various parts of the protectorate. In the more inland/ district it may be a few rupees.more. A M.H. rifle or carbine could probably not be supplied at under Rs.40/-. It can thus be understood that the large profit to be gained by exchange of the two v/ould constitute a source of income which neither the Abdali Sultan nor any other Arab Chief would be slow to avail himself of. 14. It is these and similar considerations v/hich have led to some hesitation on the part of this Residency before giv-ung full effect to the plicy of Government within the limits of this Protectorate. Government have already been informed under his Office lTo.4418, dated the 23rd July last of the incident connected with the Sheikh of the Juleidi. Upon the receipt of your 110.5023, dated the 11th August 1905 the Juiedi Sheikh was at once written to to come into Aden to discuss the matter but he has not yet come to Aden and his continued abs nee coupled withwith the conclus- T) T ions to be derived from the marg ina ally noted corres- Letter from the Abdali dated 18-8-05 and accompaniment. Letter to the Abdali Sultan, Letter from do. d/-29-8-05 Letter to do. fetter from do’. P ondence with the Abdali Sultan of which copies are attached, tend to confirm the impression already foreshadowed in para fourth of tnis Office letter lTo.4410, just referred to, that it is one in which Abdali interests are concerned as well as Juledi. 15. I would here remarked further for the consideration of Government that granted the desirability of arming the regular armed followers of a few of the more important Chiefs of this Protectorate, it would fct least appear inadvisaole to afford such a concession to a petty section j of a sub-tiibe of the Subehi such as the Juledi who only number 70 men all told. There are many such sections or clans numbering from 10 to 100 men, a,s per list attached, amongst the Subehis who own little if any allegiance to their nominal Chiefs or Sheikhs and the expediency of placing weapons of precision in the hands of such clans whose instincts have furthermore from time im memorial been predatory, seems open to question. 16. If Government desire that full effect should now be given without further delay to the policy under reference, I would at least recommend that the supply of arms and ammunition should be restricted to the marginally noted Chiefs of the —.—Protectorate and that it should be left to my discretion to add to and reduce that list according to cir cumstances. Abdali Padthli Akrabi Wahidi, Bir Ali, Balahaf. Mokalla Lower and Upper Aulaki Lower and Upper Yaffai Amiri Haushabi Behan. 17. I do not recommend that effect should be given to the suggestion to exchange seized arms for arms of Government bore. If any action is desired to induce the larger Chiefs to in terest themselves in making seizures, I would recommend that seized arms be purchased at market rates s,nd thereupon des- trdyeddestrc2 r Gd or disposed of as Government choose. This would he a more economical course than the proposed exchange. 18. Colonel Scallon has left it upon record that General Swayne was in favour of arming certain of the Protectorate Tribes and of enforcing a disarmament of all others, and he was inclined to favour a similar policy for this Protectorate. He considered further that the Chiefs of this protectorate should he required to disarm all their subjects except those employed in their police or other regular armed forces who should, he thought he armed with rifles of Government bore. He opined that it would in the long run prove economical if Government gave the Chiefs a monetary inducement to agree to this action. 19. There is a fair reason to suppose that the general arming of the tribes of this protectorate with weapons of pre cision may entail serious trouble and expense in the future, and this is a point to which I would invite the special consi deration of Government as quite distinct from the requirements of Somaliland. And with a view to securing the co-operation of the Chiefs it would seem advisable to at the outset reduce the cost price of weapons of Government bore to a minimum and to even sell them at some loss with a view to securing their introduction. 20. The question of the disarmament of petty tribes and of other than regular or quasi regular forces is of course a serious one and might quite possibly entail grave difficulties and expense. It is however north consideration as possibly saving far greater trouble and expense at a later date. It is a measure which I commend to Government as worthy of careful and early consideration. 21. In this connection I would here mention/ that Colonel Scallon has also left it upon record that with a view to check ing the Makhodas of country craft from carrying arms nominally for protection but really for sale he considered that all arms thus allowed to be carr ied should be marked and registered and also entered on the vessel^ manifest. This measure to be successful would need the co-operation if not only both British andand Italian Somaliland, Tout also of Turkey and of the Indian coasts and the Persian Gulf authorities* 22* In regard to other protective and presentive measures I have the honour to state that I agree with Colonel Scallcn in considering that very little really effective action can he taken hy H.M.S* stationed at Aden to check the illicit arms traffic. A man-of-war is too large and too valuable to ne taken about where coral reefs abound. Her boats and pinnaces are unable to overtake a fast sailing dhow. p; er movements cannot be sufficiently secret and H*aebe3» unobserved to be really effective. Past experience on these coasts has proved very how little she can really do. 23. I strongly recommend to Government the early purcnase ans establishment of two or three commodious armed dhows fitted with patrol motors, and manned, if possible, by officers and lascars of the Royal Indian Marine. I would propose to post one or two of these to Aden and another to Perim instead of or in addition to the launch already recommended for that Island in this office Po.595*7, da.r3d the 1st Instu,n-&gt;. 24. I make this recommendation after very careful con sideration as the best means of effectively dealing with the matter. The dhows could move freely in all waters and in all weathers during which arms dhows run. Tre a^ -ached motor would render her independent of the breeze and add to her speed in order to overtake suspicious looking craft. Her movements would attract little attention and she could proceed un-observed all round the coasts at frequent and uncertain intervals. 25. The vessels officered and manned by the Royal Indianf ^ Marine would be directly under the orders of the Government of India whose officers have experience of natives of the East and are accustomed to deal with Native crews. The vessels could be attached to the R.I.M. Vessel stationed at Aden as tenders and reliefs could thus be conveniently arranged for the crews. 26. I would venture to add that should the men-of-war now employed in the Persian Gulf be replaced by vessels and arrangementsx ^ noAn a qavine would prolalDly be arrangements of this nature made a savi.v , to the Government of India effected in the llaval charges debited to we u -»-« •initipi expenditure upon tnc which would probably cower all initial ex., 27 In addition tothe above I would recommend that at certain ports along the coast detachments of a local levy corps should be established to watch the coasts and the mam routes leading thereto. This is a measure which Government may still ~ T&gt;n+ T would re command its consider it desirable to postpone, but m^ratin ^t present there is little doubt tnat early recensideraom. the control exercised by the Sultan over the ports and xhor Umera and Ras-al-Arah is not productive of the desired result, and probably actively to the contrary. 28. I find that this letter has exceed the length to which I'hoped to limit it and I will therefore make my further remarks concerning the proposed amendments to the Aden Sea • -H.. 3 =nbiect of another cO!aiiuniC*tton Traffic in Arms Regulation We sut&gt; u , . , r +v,pr-eafter hone to submit a furtner and as before stated I thereat ter report upon the state of affairs at .Tibouti. 29. As to that I would for the present merely state that I have iood reason to believe that there is an active trade-in arms still proceeding between Tajurrah Bay and We coasts Arabia. A certain W r.

To this end, it is said that the coast is to be divided into three zones of observation: 1. From Bab el-Mandeb to Camaran. 2. From Camaran to the post of El Yesim. 3. From El Vesim to the station of El Ashra. With head-quarters respectively at (1) Jebel Sefer, (2) Farsan Island, (3) some suitable island, not yet decided upon. Each zone is to be provided with a small steamer of not less than 12 knots speed, and carrying two Q.F. guns of 30—10 millim. calibre. 'With each steam-boat will be an auxiliary flotilla of four or five sambooks—the whole to be under the supervision of the Commodore at Hodeida, who is to have a special steamer for the purpose. Each sambook is to carry a small Q.F. gun. The crews of these as well as of the steamers will be natives, but when on duty soldiers will be embarked. This flotilla will be employed principally in preventing the importation of arms and other contraband articles into the Yemen. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) H.

I have the honour to report, for the information of Government, that on the 19th ultimo I received a telegram from the Assistant Resident at Perim that he had received reliable information that 70 slaves were shortly about to be despatched from Tajourah to Jeddah. 2. I communicated this information at once to the Senior Naval Officer, Aden, and also by telegram to His Majesty’s Consul at Jeddah, and I attach herewith a copy of a letter which I have now received in reference to that information from the Senior Naval Officer, Aden. 3. 1 am instructing the Assistant Resident at Perim to send me any further information he can collect from native craft visiting that island as to the movements of M. Grandjean’s dhows. H. M. S. “ Pox ” at Perim ; 31st August 1905. In reply to your communication of 19th and 22nd instant with reference to the slave trade between Prench and Turkish territories, I have the honour to bring to your notice the following information obtained from native sources, on this°subject and also on the arms traffic in the Red Sea. 2. Some caravans have recently arrived at Tajourah from Abyssinia, one of which was commanded by Mahomed Abu Rekr, a General of King Menelek. He was taking the following presents from his Sovereign to the Turkish Sultan • viz.j 10 eunuchs, 2 lions, 2 ostriches, 1 zebra, and several other wild animals. These came by dhows from lajourah to Jibouti, where they were transhipped to the Prench mail for Port Said, about 17th, en route to Constan tinople. 3. In the other caravan were a considerable number of Abyssinian slave- girls. These were shipped in two dhows, 73 in one and 12 in the other, at a place 11°—20° S. W. of Perim, inside the Brothers. They passed through the Straits of Babel Mandeb at night about 11th or 15th instant. 4. The dhows belong to the Chief of Rahaita, an Italian subject, who received 12 dollars a head for conveying them to Jeddah. 5. M. Grandjean, the Government Agent in charge at Obokh, is very nearly a native, having married a Danakil woman, wTiilst he wears an Arab dress, and lives in native style. He is reputed to possess seven other native wives, the majority of whom are Abyssinians and represent the toll paid by caravans for permission to traverse Prench territory. He owns six armed native dhows (French colours) that act as escorts to native vessels. [925PH]6. Although no arms can officially leave Jihouti, there is never any diffi culty in obtaining a clearance from Obokh by vessels engaged in this traffic. 7. M. Grandjean is an excellent linguist, whilst his knowledge of native customs is unique, and he is doubtless of the very greatest service to his Government in the position he now holds, despite his sympathies for slaving and gun running. 8. Canoes leave Obokh frequently for Kadduha to southward of Mokha, with from 80—100 rifles in each. 9. Owing to the disarmament of the Arabs in Yemen by the Turks, the Arabs are now endeavouring to re-arm themselves, and find Kadduha a very suitable place, as the Turkish troops did not stop at Mokha, and never visited Kadduha, while it is within easy reach of Obokh.

The complaint referred to in the first paragraph thereof will appear from the attached copy of a communication addressed by this office to the Senior Naval Officer a short time ago. 3. The arms traffic question is one which I am about to discuss fully with General Snayne, His Majesty s Commissioner in Somaliland 1 and concern ing which I will thereafter submit a separate report. But I would here remark that a large number of native dhows of all denominations and of various nationality carry a certain number of rifles and other, arms for the purpose of their own personal protection which, upon arrival in Aden, are deposited in police custody and upon the vessels’ departure from the port are restored to theii owners. This system has been in force for years and is prescribed in the Aden local rules and thereunder import and export licenses are dispensed with in regard to such personal arms. To any arms over and above this strictly limited number the provisions of the Arms Act would of course apply.4. As to whether any effective check could he imposed upon illicit traffic in arms of foreign make by allowing British-owned vessels to carry Martini- Henry rifles only, I am not at present in a position to make any definite pronouncement of opinion. It is a matter, however, which will receive care ful attention and he reported upon again in due course in connection with the general question of endeavouring to check the illicit traffic under reference by facilitating the supply of rifles of British manufacture to all in need of them.

S. ‘ £ Fox ,, at Aden ; Piracy. 1st September 1905. Sir, I have the honour to bring to your notice the enclosed complaint of a further case of piracy upon a British vessel at Muteina in the Red Sea, which occurred not long after the case mentioned in Admiralty telegram No. 94 of 16th August 1905. These cases point to a state of affairs that require more attention from the Turkish armed vessels in the Bed Sea. 2. Last year these vessels were surveyed by the Perim Coal Company, who submitted a tender for cleaning them on their slipway, and making good their defects. This tender was not accepted and no evidence is procurable of the present state of these vessels. As they have been laid up at Kamaran Bay dur ing this summer, they may be in urgent need of repair, although the general impression is that the Turkish naval officers in command object strongly to cruising during the hottest and most trying time of the year. 3. As a result of this inaction, cargoes of slaves have recently been run in Rahaita dhows to Jeddah : there is also a constant traffic in arms between Obokh and Kadduha, whilst at least two cases of piracy upon British vessels have occurred between Hodaidah and Mokha. 4. In view of the expense and risk of employing modern ships to cruise amongst the reefs and unsurveyed waters of Turkish Arabia, I would strongly deprecate our sending anything but a wood or composite vessel of from 10 —12 draught, with a native crew. 5. As an alternative proposition I would respectfully suggest, that we reconsider the “ Arms question ” as follows :— That all British-owned vessels be licensed to carry a limited number of M.-HI rifles for their own protection. 3h f That these he registered and mustered periodically; whilst a failure to pro duce or to account for losses should render them liable to fine or loss of license' That the Government supply all the M.-H. ammunition at cost price, and thus he in a position at any moment to control the ammunition question and render these M.-H. rifles virtually useless. The only arms and ammunition now obtainable are “ Gras” rifles, one of which costs from 25 to 30 rupees, whilst ammunition can always be obtained from foreign sources. 6. The possibility of obtaining good M.-H. rifles with cheap reliable ammunition, would enable all British vessels to defend themselves from piracy and to some extent act as protectors of the peace in waters where modern men- of-war never go just as in olden days East India men were armed for their pro tection in waters where it did not suit us to send our fighting ships. 7. The Erench and Italians permit some dhows to carry arms; while recently the Indian Government ordered the release of the Turkish dhow seized by H. M. S. “ Perseus ” for gun running on the grounds that the 4 Gras rifles found in her were presumably for her self-defence in waters. I have, etc., (Sd.) J. B. EUSTACE, Captain and Senior Naval Officer.

AAca Sir As Your Excellency is aware, the extent to which Jihouti is used as a centre for the distribution of arms throughout the Red Sea Littoral has long been the subject of serious concern both to His Majesty’s Government and the Italian Government and in my des patch No. 187 Africa, of August 15th, 1902, Sir E. Monson was instructed to propose to the French Gov ernment that the fact of the departure of dhows from Jibcuti to ports outside the prohibited zone should be telegraphed to Aden so as to enable the British and Italian authorities to keep a watch on their pro ceedings. These representations, which received the sup port of the Italian Ambassador at Paris, led to no result. From the annexed copies of correspondence which has - H Js Excellency, The Right Honourable, Sir F. Bertie,G.C.M.G.,G.C.V.Ohas recently passed with the Italian Ambassador at this Court you will see that the subject has again been brought forward by the Italian Government, who are desirous that the Somali Arms Agreement re cently concluded between this country and Italy should be supplemented by Agreements with Turkey and France which would deal both with the surveillance of the Arabian Coast and the Arms traffic at Jibouti. His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople has been consulted as to the possibility of some ar rangement being come to with Turkey by which the policing of the Ottoman waters of the Red Sea would be entrusted to British and Italian war-ships, but His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires at Constantinople has reported that the scheme is not one to which the Turkish Government are likely to consent. ,r ith regard to Jibouti the Italian Government have suggested that the present is a favourable mo ment for joint representations to the French Govern ment with a view to obtain a more rigorous applica tion of the Brussels Act by the French Authorities at thatthat place, and I have accordingly to request Your Excellency, acting in concert with your Italian colleague, who has received similar instructions,to call Monsieur Delcasse's attention to the extent to which Jibouti is made use of as a distributing centre for arms, in contravention of the spirit of the Brus sels Act and to the detriment of the possessions of all three Powers and to express the earnest hope of His Majesty's Government that the French Govern ment may be willing to take steps for the total sup pression of the traffic in arms there, which exper ience has shorn it is impossible to regulate satis factorily.

It will be seen that the Bombay Government endorsed the views of the Government of India as to the desirability of securing French co-operation in the suppression or regulation of the arms trade from Jibuti. We have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servants, V £^XWZ l /.No. 6523, dated BomL&amp;y Castle, the 24th October 1904. From —C. H. A. Hill, Esq., C.I.E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bom* hay, Political Department, To—L. W. Dane, Esq., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, In consequence of the continued allusions, in the various recent communi cations received from the Resident at Aden, to the growth of the arms traffic into Southern Arabia, the Bombay Government addressed the Resident on the 16th September last requesting him to furnish them with a full report on the sources of the supply of arms to the Protectorate. I am now desired to enclose a copy of General Mason's report No. 187 of the 9th October, and to offer the following comments and suggestions. 2. In the letter from this{Government, No. 3822, dated the 22nd May 1902, the Bombay Government reported that in their opinion it was impossible en tirely to suppress the arms trade so long as the Trench maintained their present policy at Jibuti. The Governor in Council then indicated as his opinion that the best course would be to work through the Sultan of Labej and the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla and expressed the view that the establishment of posts at intervals along the Southern Arabia littoral would be easily evaded and would be regarded with suspicion by the Chiefs. The conclusion then arrived at was that'the only steps immediately possible were to introduce an effective patrol at sea. 3. General Mason has now (on the 5th instant) had a long interview with the Sultan of Lahei on the subject. The Saltan appears on a former occasion to have recommended the establishment of posts on the Subaihi coast between Aden and Turba. For the reasons given in 1902 General Mason did not agree with this suggestion, while the incompleteness of such a measure is further demonstrated by the Sultan’s statement that arms were also landed from Jibuti at points'between Hodeidaand Sheikh Said. It will be seen that an alternative endeavour, to obtain information from Jibuti, has been tried and has apparently failed • and in connection with this failure it is significant that the bona fides of the’Sultan of Lahej appear to be suspected at Aden, and, from what occurred at the recent interview between the Resident and the Sultan, it seems highly probable that, in the past at all events, the Sultan has derived some profit from the trade. It is likely that, now that it has been brought home to the Sultan that suspicion has fallen upon him, there will, foi a time at least be some check imposed upon the influx ot arms via _ the ports east of Turba though it is feared that no permanent improvement is to be looked for in this -espect East of Aden, as the Governor-General in Council is aware, the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla has afforded valuable assistance. 4 It seems to H is Excellency in Council evident that we cannot look for anv reliable or useful co-operation on the part of the Arabs in the suppression of ‘the import of arms from the other side of the Gulf of Aden to the ports on the Subaihi or Yemen coasts ; and that we must, therefore, devise o her measures to arrest the traffic. In the Despatch from the Government ot India to the Secre- tary of State, No. 83, dated the 21st April last, the Governor-Genera, in Counc. suggested that His Majesty’s Government should approach the Government of the Erench Republic with a view to concerting measures which might lead to the final removal, or at least to a considerable mitigation of the evil; and reference was made to clause 6 of the Agreement of 1888 with the French Government. The Governor in Council is not aware whether any action has been taken upon that proposal, but it seems to him to he the only method winch goes to the root of the evil and which would satisfactorily settle the present ques ion. The Other alternatives may possibly render the traffic more difficult, but they will not put a stop to it. 5. Since patrol at sea, as appears to be the case, canllot &gt; m '' m S tf &gt; tIu ' measures concerted by those engaged in arms running, he made effectual, and since the co operation, at all times doubtful, of the Subathi Chieftains, acting in concert with the Chief of Lahej, cannot he counted upon as a permanent2 aid, His Excellency desires to suggest, for the consideration of the Government of India, that the results of General Mason’s enquiries should be reported to the Secretary of State, and that His Majesty’s Government should again be urged to secure the co-operation of the Erench in the suppression or regulation of the arms trade from Jibuti. No. 187, dated Aden Residency, the 9th October 1901. From— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident at Aden, To C. H. A. Hill Esq., C.I.E , Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. In reply to your letter No. 5661, dated the 16th September 1904, request ing me to furnish you with a full report of the result of the enquiries made by me in regard to the constant supply of arms coming to the Protectorate, to which I had made reference in an earlier communication of mine, I have the honour to ttate that the fact that arms were entering into the limits under British protection was noticed by me, as already stated, in my tour in July last to Dthala. What has transpired since will appear from the following report. 2. The first step that I took was to have a conversation on the subject with the Ahdali Sultan at Lahej on my return journey from Dthala. He then requested me to recommend him to Government for a monthly sum of Rs. 800 or thereabouts whereby he may be enabled to establish police posts on the sea hoard towards the west of Aden for the purpose of preventing the illicit impor tation of arms through the places along the coast, especially Ras-al-Arah, via which, as Government are aware, the traffic is carried on. I did not, however, concur in the suggestion, as I thought that these posts could easily be evaded *&gt;y those engaged in the trade—an opinion which the Bombay Government themselves have held in their letter No. 3822, dated the 22nd May 1902, to the address of the Government of India. 3. As an alternative I suggested that if we could obtain information from Jibuti, the main source of the supply of arms, as to when and to which places the dhows with arms were sailing we might effect a capture. The Sultan fell in with the idea and a plan was worked out and has been tried, arrangements having been made for the despatch of special cipher telegrams. 4. Three or four such telegrams were received. But although on one occasion I arranged for the H. M. S. Porpoise to try and effect the capture of the dhow reported to be coming, the attempt proved unsuccess ful. Again in September I received information of a dhow conveying arms to Ras Imran. As I had no one whom I could send out, I communicated with the Sultan asking him to do what he could, as he had his men at that place, as would appear from the preamble of Government Resolution No. 1818, dated the 22nd March 1899. He was also unsuccessful. A day or two later, however, he sent in twelve rifles and two boxes containing about 2,400 rounds of ammunition, saying that his brother had caught camels laden with these arms and ammunition, hut had let the men go as they were hirelings. 5. What the cause of failure in both these instances may be—whether it is because the information received from Jibuti was unfounded, or because of the excellent system of signalling which, it is reported, the men engaged in this trade have of reporting the appearance of vessels, etc., or owing to the Sultan having proved apathetic—I am not in a position to say. 6. I would here bring to the notice of Government that I had again an interview with the Sultan of Lahej this month at Sheikh Othman, when the subject of the illicit traffic in arms was for a second time discussed. It was again pointed out to the Sultan that large quantities of arms and ammunition were finding their way into the Protectorate, and it was explained to him that this was as much a source of danger to himself as to the British. He con curred, hut when he was asked to assist in checking this trade he said that it will he necessary for him to send large numbers of men to the various placesl0 ^l n iesil irate, fc be I in Jilj iiiil isntjeet Hetlei tilfh al, eii Mfl, enleJ iniMt pats oe one :t tti mc» liai IW ',1814 -i on the coast and that he woiild have to incur great expense. In other words, he revived the proposal for police posts made at the previous interview. I again pointed out the utter futility of the establishment of such posts. The Saltan then went on explaining that the arms are brought from Jibuti and that between Sheikh Said and Hodeida there were several places where they are landed and that arms come via Maskat also. Under the circumstance he stated he saw no v ay of stopping the traffic except by the British and the French Governments adopting stringent measures at Jibuti and Maskat. I then explained to the Sultan that though an understanding may be arrived at with the French, it did not relieve me of the responsibility of being watchful within my own jurisdiction and asked him to assist me by his own personal influence and authority in the matter ; as measures such as sending out men- of-war to capture buggalows carrying arms, etc., have, as illustrated in the instance quoted above, been unsuccessful, owing, presumably, to the persons engaged in this clandestine trade having the system of signals alluded to above. At this point of interview I thought it best that I should tell the Sultan what I had heard about himself in connection with the matter. At the request of the Admiralty a trustworthy agent has been posted by me at Jibuti to report on the movements of Russian men-of-war calling at that port. This agent is a Chaldean Christian of Baghdad who had recently been transferred from the Bushire Residency as Confidential Clerk in my office. He reported that it had come to his knowledge that the Sultan of Lahej had agents at Jibuti who were sending over arms and ammunition into the Sultan’s country and that the Sultan received one rifle out of ten landed, and proportionate ammuni tion for the same ; moreover, there are persistent rumours that a brisk trade in arms is going on in Lahej itself. These matters were delicately broached to the Sultan w T ho seemed somewhat ill-at-ease, but assured me that such was not | the case, and that the persons reported to be his agents were really spies sent by him on our behalf. He admitted, however, that trade had been going on | formerly at Lahej and stated that should it appear to him that the traffic in arms still exists, he would have it declared throughout his territory that his subjects engaged in such trade will be punished, and that if the Resident cam. arrange to send detectives to give him information as to who the dealers in | arms in his territory are, he will see that they are severely dealt with. 7. The above interview took place in the evening on TV ednesday, the 5th instant. The very next day the Sultan sent in 11 rifles and 2,275 rounds of ammunition which he states Said Omer bin Ali, the head of the village of Wahat, had seized. But it is curious that in this case also the culprits are not forthcoming. 8. For the present we may await events and see how many further captures the Sultan is able to effect. But as far as we are concerned, I can personally see no way of catching the buggalows conveying the arms except by having armed dhows to cruise about the coast or by coming to an understanding with the French Government in reference to the arms traffic at Jibuti.Z/c?6 /ft ^&lt;1 Departments are requested, if they suspect that there is any mistake in this telegram, to communicate immediately with the Private Secretary to the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State. . f » 14 DEC 1904)*', COPY OF TELEGRAM FROM Dated Ilf Qftc.

The following instructions are issued in order to prevent the illicit importation of arms into Soma liland in accordance with the General Act of the Con ference of Brussels, approved by the law of 13th July, 1892. 1. The Officers of the Royal Warships and armed sambuks , stationed on the east coast of Africa and those at any time employed in those waters on any other mission, shall exercise in the waters of the Italian Somali Protectorate, an active and continual viyilance over such vessels as they may meet and es pecially over the native sailing vessels (sambuks), by which the illicit transport of arms can more easily be carried out or attempted on account of the facility with which they can escape the notice of warships. 2. The above mentioned officers in all cases where they consider fit in the execution of their de- ties may search native vessels in the territorial wa ters of the protectorate, to see that their papers are inin order and to examine their cargo and may order them to heave to for that purpose and even use force to compel them to do so, if necessary. 3. Any vessel, ordered to stop, must at once heave to and wait for the visit of an officer from the warship or sambuk issuing the order. 4. If the vessel does not obey the order, the Conmander of the warship or sambuk in pursuit shall make his intimation clearer by a blank shot and a loaded shot across the bows, if the vessel continues its flight. If after this final intimation the ves sel does not comply with the command, measures shall be taken to capture her by force, firing loaded shot at first at the sails and rigging and finally at the hull so as to prevent her escape. 5. Similarly any vessel shall be seized which, when boarded and searched, shall attempt to resist; or if she refuses to produce her papers or in other way attempts to impede the Naval Authorities in the / exercise of their proper duties, 6. Any vessel also shall be seized, whose papers areI Y' are defective or irregular; or in cases where the illicit transport of arms on board is discovered or the cargo has been thrown overboard, during pursuit. 7. If only slight irregularities or omissions of the prescribed formalities be discovered in the course of the search and if such discoveries do not confirm any suspicion of contraband, the vessel shall not be seized, but shall be warned to put her papers in order at the first port of call, the Authorities, whose duty it is to superintend and inspect ships* i papers, being informed. 8. Full verbal particulars, Indicating the ac- tion taken and all details as to time and place should be given respecting every seizure visit or search. 9. Officers, who are given the right of search and other facilities for the performance of their police duties, should use them with prudence and cau tion especially in the case of vessels under a foreign flag so as to avoid giving cause for protests and claims for indemnification on account of illegal no-' 10. In order to render the measures for the t suppression of the arms traffic on the Somali coast more efficacious an agreement has been concluded be tween the Italian and British Governments for the co operation and mutual assistance of the warships of the two nations. By the terms of this agreement the Officers of the British Navy may exercise the right of search over native vessels in the territorial waters of the Ital ian Protectorate in accordance with the powers con ferred by the present instructions on the Officers of the Royal Navy, who, in their turn, shall have analo gous rights in the territorial waters of the British Protectorate. 11. On the initiative of the British Government negotiations are proceeding with the Sultan of Muscat in order to obtain his authorization for the confis- f^- ■ ' cation of arms and ammunition in the territorial wat- ¥ .1. ora and on the sarnbnks, of that Sultanate. The Officers of the Royal Navy shall regulate their own action in accordance with the terns find withinwithin the limits of such authorization granted to the Officers of the British Navy. 12. If fin Italian ship captures a sairibuk under the British Flag or that of the Sultan of Muscat, she shall take it to Ber’cera and deliver It to the first British warship she meets with the papers stating the circumstances and grounds of the seizure, captured sairibuk fly the Italian flag, It shall be ,.ak- en to Masaana and there delivered to the Government of the Colony with the papers concerning the capture for further measures.

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. To The Right Hoh’ble St. JOHN BROHRICK, Sis Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 21st April 1904. Sir, In onr despatch No. 112 (Secret-External), dated the 30th July 1903, we addressed your predecessor on the subject of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf with special reference to the unrestricted importation at Maskat and the menace involved to our North-Western Prontier. Since then we have had forced upon our notice the danger which is springing up in the Aden Hinterland owing to the ease with which arms and ammunition are obtained throughout that dependency, and our attention has been particularly called to Jibuti, whence there flows a continuous stream of arms to the Arabian seaboard and to the Somali Coast, and where conditions exist the continuance of which must in a large measure frustrate the object of our endeavours at Maskat and in the Persian Gulf. 2. The question of the traffic at Jibuti is an old one. In 1888 an Anglo- Erench agreement was concluded whereby it was agreed that the two Govern ments should take all necessary measures to prevent the importation of gun powder and arms in the territories subject to their authority on the Somali Coast The subject has since formed the topic of much negotiation. Proposals have been made and discussed for the cancellation of the Anglo-Prench engage- ™ P nt and for the substitution of a wider tripartite arrangement between the Governments of His Majesty and of Prance and Italy. The Brussels Conven tion has been framed and ratified with its special provisions for the repression of the trade in arms, which, however, unfortunately do not apply to the Arabian Peninsular or to the coasts of the Persian Gulf. But the clear language of the Agreement of 1888 appears to have been lost sight of, and the traffic m arms has gradually expanded and become established, until it is now deliberately asserted that several hundred thousand rifles and innumerable cases of arms are annually poured into the port of Jibuti, whence they are disseminated through out the whole of the Middle East. # , , , o The ev ii has from time to time been brought to notice. In our despatch No. 169 (Secret-External), dated the 7th October 1891, we addressed His Maiestv’s Government on tbe menace to our interests m Somaliland, whic then under the administration of the Government of India. Again, m 1898 we drew attention to the danger in the Aden Hinterland. It has not irnwn less with years in either of those regions. We are not now responsible for the former, hut the latter still remains in onr charge, and recent events connected with the proceedings of the Boundary Commission have impressed the matter forcibly on our minds. Nor is the danger one which threatens Tj iK.v, interests only. The Italians and the Turks appear to be hardly less affected, and have more than once urged the adoption of, or expressed their2 willingness to co-operate in, measures which may check the indiscriminate introduction of arms into their African Protectorate and their possessions on the Red Sea littoral. Prance alone of the parties concerned appears at present to feel no inconvenience from the existing state of affairs. On the other hand, with the co-operation of the Prench secured, and the importation of arms forbidden both at Jibuti and at Maskat, we believe that an end might he put to this obnoxious traffic, not only on the seaboard of Southern Arabia, on the / Somali Coast, and on the Red Sea littoral, but also in the Persian Gulf and throughout the waters of the Middle East. The prohibition appears to be one which might be enforced without practical difficulty in the case of merchant steamers; and in the absence of regular entrepots, stocked with arms brought from Europe in such vessels, and lying within the ordinary beat of native craft, obvious difficulties would be placed in the way of a continuance of smuggling by the Arab dhows which now habitually engage in the traffic. The restriction should, of course, apply not only to consignments manifested for Jibuti as their final destination, but also to all arms intended for transhipment at that port except under most stringent conditions of surveillance and control. 4 . We are aware that the question of the interpretation which should be placed on clause 6 of the Agreement of 1888, and of the limitations which should be held to restrict its application, have more than once formed the subject of discussion with the Prench Government : that it may be held that our own action in regard to the importation of arms into Abyssinia in the past amounted to an infringement of the understanding, at any rate until the negus at some date before August 1893 adhered to the Brussels Act; and that in 1890, on the failure of the negotiations for the tripartite arrangement, Mons. Nisard*observed to our Ambassador in Paris that, in view of our attitude, he presumed that both Governments had recovered full liberty of action. We also notice that the Prench Government appear to consider that the provisions of the Brussels Agreement have caused the earlier instrument to fall into abeyance. We find nothing, however, to suggest that His Majesty’s Government have ever definitely surrendered their rights under the Agreement of 1888 ; it appears to us that we are still entitled to appeal to its provisions ; and this seems also to have been the view of His Majesty’s Government, when in 1901 Lord Lansdowne instructed our Ambassador in Paris to refer to the engagement set out in Article 6. The Prench Government, though professing themselves to be guided by the provisions of the Brussels Convention, admitted their obligations, and actually took formal measures to forbid the traffic. The trade, however, still appears to continue with unabated vigour, and, in view of the importance of the question, we should be glad if His Majesty’s Government could take the opportunity of the cordial relations at present existing with Prance to induce the Republican Government to agree to measures which may lead to the final removal or at least to a considerable mitigation of this long standing evil.

WE have the honour to address your Lordship on the subject of the arms trade at Muscat and in the Persian Gulf, a matter which has now engaged the close attention of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India since 1897. 2. During this period a series of measures has been taken with the object of checking and controlling the traffic. In 1898 the Persian Government were induced to prohibit the importation of arms into the territories of the Shah, and to confer upon our ships of war the right of searching vessels carrying the Persian flag. The Sultan of Muscat was then prevailed upon to issue notifications, warning his subjects that the importation of arms into India and Persia was illegal, and authorizing British and Persian ships of war to search, within Muscat territorial waters, vessels carrying the British, Persian, or Muscat flag. Shortly afterwards similar notifications were issued by the Chief of Bahrein, together with a Proclamation prohibiting the importa tion into, or the exportation from, that island of all arms and ammunition. In 1900, Sheikh Mubarak agreed to prohibit all import and export of arms at Koweit and in the territories under his control, and, at the close of 1902, the 'Trucial Chiefs entered into similar engagements. Other precautions may also be briefly mentioned. In 1898, with a view to increasing the check on the traffic in Oman, rules were issued requiring all subjects of His Majesty possessing arms within the dominions of the Sultan to register the same at the British Consulate. In 1900 a Vice-Consul was posted to Bunder Abbas, where it was hoped that the presence of a British officer might lead to the display of greater vigour in the repression of the illicit importation of arms along the neighbouring portions of the Persian coast. In the same year we took steps to bring within the scope of the Indian Arms Act arms, ammunition, and warlike stores brought into an Indian port and declared under manliest to be consignments without transhipment to any port on the seaboard of the Persian Gulf- linaliy, in 1902, an arrangement was made with the Governor-General of Kerman for the adoption of special measures to prevent the importation of arms into Persian Baluchistan, and to impose restrictions on their possession in that province. At the neighbouring port of Gwadur the traffic had previously been declared illegal by order of the Sultan of Muscat proclaimed in 1891. . 3. 1 he efforts made do not appear to have been entirely fruitless. Some indication oi the extent of the trade is afforded by the periodical information which we receive from your Lordship of consignments from Great Britain to the Persian • j • A. i • f, nnex a s t a t en ient showing the total of the arms and ammunition m mated m these returns from 1897 up to April 1903. The figures show a growing traffic up to 1~00, when the number of rifled weapons imported into Muscat reached w G ^ a s ^ nce year there is evidence of a satisfactory decline. . ? a S Pxi° n P ai iP a s ^ a J :emen f prepared from figures funished by the Customs autho rities oi the Sultan at Muscat. It is unfortunate that the Customs returns show only e value and not the number of weapons imported year by year. We learn, however, a m J 1 91 the number of weapons which were declared at His Highness’Customs offices was 25,000, while in 1901-1902 it was 17,000, and these figures, together with the valuation statements, neither of which is likely to be overstated, while they support the view that since 1900 the trade has received a check, indicate that the entries in the return of arms exported from the United Kingdom represent only a little more than half of the total traffic. It is evident, therefore, that the dimensions of the trade are still formidable. The ultimate destination of the arms ^landed at Muscat is in a measure conjectural. Beliefs have from time to time been ^expressed that large numbers are transhipped to the Somali Coast. But the existence of anv considerable traffic with the African seaboard has not been established, and it seems* probable that the consignments eventually find their way into the interior of Oman, to the Arab and Turkish coasts of the Gulf, and to the Persian seaboard, whence it is certain that a proportion reach the tribes on the north-western frontier of India, with results that constitute a grave menace to the peace of our border. 4.. We now proceed to the consideration of further measures for the repression ot the traffic. In our Secret despatch dated the 6th March, 1902, we suggested that the Sultan should be advised to introduce a system of passes for the exporta tion of arms from his territories. In reply, however, your Lordship expressed the opinion that, in view of the then existing relations with Prance m regard to Muscat, the moment was inopportune for the proposed step. Later m our Secret despatch dated the 29th January last, we recommended that the French Government should be asked to a^ree to the prohibition by the Sultan of Muscat of all importation of arms and am munition into his dominions. To this communication we have not yet received a reply • but, in view of the conciliatory attitude adopted by His Majesty s Goiernment in P connection with the recent French flag incident at Muscat, and of the presem cordial relations with France, we hope that His Majesty’s Govemme^t may now be prepared to approach the French Government on the subject, ihe Customs h 0 &amp; in the annexed statement show clearly that the suppression ot the traffic would lead to a loss to British trade far greater than the damage which would result to i reach commercial interests, and this should suffice to prove to the French Governmen that our object is not to interfere with legitimate French trading at Muscat, but merely to take measures in self-defence to prevent arms falling into the hands ot the tribes on our borders. We can hardly believe that the French Government could declfne to agree to our proposal, and your Lordship will recollect t^t this view was held bv M Laronce, the late Acting Vice-Consul for France at Muscat. inc principal Bepresentative at Muscat of French interests in the traffic is M Goguyer, an 1 'ctArl K-wl character reuardiii'' whose removal from Oman we have addressed you “hm ?n a 'eparate d S *h,t and whose cause we cannot imagine that the French Government could seriously desire to champion. They could hardly defenn as a^act 1 of International comity the introduction of arms among the tribes surrounding the Gulf- and they could not pretend that the weapons were required lor any purpose ot their own l/might, however, be necessary for the Government of India o compensate the Sultan of Muscat for the loss of his ^“^'^fUear'for the existing trade, which amounted on the average to about 4,0,000 dollars a-year thiee^years endtn^iso ^ ^rther measul . e y-pigh we would urge.

Me regard the conclu sion of some arrangement with Turkey as an indispensable adjunct of our scheme, and&lt;* its necessity would not he removed by the prohibition of the traffic at Muscat. That ^ measure, we have no doubt, would provide a check more effective than any yet devised, but we could not hope that it would entirely abolish the trade. In our Confidential Marine despatch of the 9th October, 1902, we recommended to your Lordship the removal of the present restrictions on the arming of vessels of the Indian Marine, and we explained that it was our desire to organize a more effective system of patrol for the capture of smugglers of arms. We regret that in your Lordship’s Military despatch, dated the 26th June last, you have been unable to accede to our request; although the changes indicated as to the disposition of His Majesty’s ships in Indian waters in your Military despatch of the 3rd July last, will add somewhat to the patrolling power of the navy in the Persian Gulf. The obstacles in the way of an effective naval patrol under existing conditions are clearly explained in the letter from Commander Kemp, dated the 11th September, 1902,* anil in the absence of some understanding with Turkey, the task of the best organized preventive service must remain one of the utmost difficulty. 6. We take this opportunity of forwarding, for your Lordship’s consideration, the accompanying copy of a letter from our Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, requesting the cancellation of the rules which were issued by the British Consul at Muscat on the 27th June, 1898, and which place certain restrictions on the posses sion of arms by British subjects within the dominions of the Sultan. So long as the trade continues, it is desirable that, so far as possible, it should remain in the hands of British subjects rather than that it should pass to Trench firms, and that business at Muscat should thus become more profitable than ever to M. Goguyer and his fellows. W e realize that the regulations in question must tend to place British traders at a disadvantage compared w T ith their rivals of other nationalities, and we are inclined to think that this consideration more than outweighs the advantage of the limited degree of control which the rules secure.

I HAVE the honour to forward a copy of a letter, with inclosure, from the Political Agent at Muscat on the subject of the arms trade. 2. Major Cox appears to be of opinion that the Rules and R/egulations which were brou°*ht into force in 1898 whereby British subjects at Muscat are compelled to furnish information regarding the importation and sale by them of arms and ammuni tion, in practice place British traders in such articles under a disadvantage as compared with traders of other nationalities. 3. Experience, I think, has shown that the introduction of the aforesaid Rules and Regulations has not imposed any check upon the arms trade; and the question has therefore to be considered whether the Political Agent might not now he authorized to rescind the Rules and Regulations, or at any rate, to hold them in abeyance. The fact of his being authorized to do so, could not I think be considered to be in any way an encouragement on our part of the trade in arms. It would merely remove certain restrictions which at present debar our subjects from competing in the trade on terms of equality with dealers of othei nationalities. [2263] EInclosure 4 in No. 2. Major Cox to Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball. Muscat, March 4, 1903. I HAVE the honour to forward, for favour of submission to Government, with your views, true copy of a representation lodged with me yesterday by the local British-Indian merchants taking part, among other branches of trade, in the arms trade. 2. As long as the weekly returns continue to he furnished I am obliged to take notice of irregularities or remark upon unusual entries, otherwise the furnishing of them becomes a farce. At the same time there is no doubt that the signatories’ exposition of the disadvantages under which they labour compared to merchants of non-British nationality is well founded. 3. M. Goguyer especially, as elsewhere reported, has been doing a thriving trade for a long time past; and during my recent absence in India, a Russian subject named Bederian, agent of the Russian firm of “ M. Keverkoff and Co.,” hailing, I believe, from Odessa, arrived here from Harrar and Jibuti, and took up his residence in the house of the petty Naval Officer in charge of the French coal depot. He also hired premises in the bazaar where he displays samples of various merchandise, specially liquor and arms, and is doing business in these lines and receiving shipments from Europe. 4. Short of bringing about modifications in the terms of existing Treaties, it does not appear to me that any measures which we can devise will prove a really effective check on the arms trade as long as foreigners can engage in the traffic without any restrictions whatever; and this foreign competition is a factor which will have to be reckoned with to an increasing extent as time goes on. Inclosure 5 in No. 2. Gopaljee Waljee and others to Major Cox. . Muscat, March 3, 1903. WE, the Undersigned, your humble petitioners, traders in arms and ammunition, within the territories of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, most humbly beg to bring to your honour’s notice our following requisitions :— lo begin with, the object of this our humble Memorial your petitioners crave leave to point out to you that from very old time, your petitioners continued to possess complete freedom and monopoly in the trade—a privilege which they enjoyed for a good many years. But since 1898, the local Consular authority adopted quite different attitude towards the trade. Stringent Rules and Regulations were passed in succession against the dealers in the trade, the effect of which has simply been to drive the trade rom the hands of your petitioners, inasmuch as they are made liable to the aforesaid restrictions. I ormerly, when your petitioners ruled the market, they never trusted the Arabs and other dealers to sell their rifles on their behalf, nay they did not give anybody a n e m advance w ithout cash payment. Buc now, finding themselves under restrictions, are compelled to land a good deal of their cargo to the local Arab dealers, who in turn ma e much profit at your petitioner’s expense. Also they are now getting direct consignments from Continental makers. The reason why the trade is falling off from the hands of your petitioners is that ley have to submit to their Consular authorities weekly reports of sale of their arms and ammunitions in their possession, also quantities and qualities which they import, v i i ic names, residence, and nationality of buyers, in slight default of which they are brought to hook. ' ° I he aforesaid Rule acts greatly to your petitioners’ disadvantage inasmuch as other dealers in arms are freed from it. The local Arab dealers do submit weekly repor o sa e and names of buyers to His Highness the Sultan, but they are not compe e to give their locality or nationality, an omission which acts greatly in their avour. lie the people ol other European parts, viz., the French and Greeks, do not stand under any such restrictions whatever. htneier your petitioners begin to ask the buyers their true names and locality,11 the buyers get suspicious about your petitioners’ inquiries in fear that your petitioners should reveal in Consulate their names, and hence the buyers generally prefer to buy arms from other dealers save the British; although they might dispose their arms 2 or 3 dollars cheaper than those dealers. It is only in the last alternative when the other dealers possess no stock that the buyers come to your petitioners to d&gt;ny arms. * The result of this policy has been to drive the trade from the hands of your petitioners and thrust it upon other adventurers who are day by day getting firmly established in the trade as manifested by monthly imports. It is now only the French firms who import every month two-thirds of the whole cargo. Had it not been lor the existence of such restrictions upon your petitioners, they make bold to say that they would never have allowed themselves to be elbowed out by the French, Greeks, and Arabs as they have been at present. It is only this advantage complete freedom to deal in arms—which has given a footing to the French to establish themselves here commercially. Your petitioners, in conclusion, beg to reiterate that unless their position is improved they stand in danger of losing the trade altogether from their hands. It is only now when thinking that crisis have been reached, your petitioners have dared to approach your honour for the redress of their grievances, and fervently hope that your honour will free them from the weekly registration of arms and ammunition and place them on the equal footing as compared with the traders of other nationality, for which act of kindness they shall ever pray for your long life and prosperity. No. 3. The Marquess of Lansdowne to Sir N. 0 Conor. ~ ^ Foreign Office, September 1903. I TRANSMIT to your Excellencv herewith copies of correspondence, as marked in the margin,* with Nobel’s Explosive Company, relative to an order received by them from Bulgaria for the supply of dynamite and gun-cotton. Your Excellency will observe that it has been thought best to decline to give the Company anv information as to the action which His Majesty’s Government might be willin- to take in the event of the seizure of the explosives by the lurkisli Govern- ment^but I should be glad to receive any observations which you may have to otter on the questions raised in this correspondence. . + I should also wish to be furnished with some more precise information as* to the exact les;al position of the Turkish Government with regard to the importation of material of war into the Ottoman Dominions. It appears from Mr. goschen despatch No. 372, of the 20th September, 1880, that the lurkish Government in tba, year drew up certain Regulations which, while permitting the importation of arms and ammunition for sporting purposes, prohibited the importation of material of wai. No obiection was raised by His Majesty’s Government to the issue of these Regula tions, but it is not clear from the documents in the possession of this Department whether they came into operation and are still in force. I have to request, therefore, that your Excellency will furnish me with a repoit on the subject, with special reference to the course which it might be necessary to pursue in the event of consignments of arms from British firms being seized by the Turkish authorities previous to a declaration of war. ^ ^ (Signed) ’ LANSDOWNE. * Nobel’s Explosive Company, August 29; to ditto, September 14; September 16, 1903. Nobel’s Explosive Company,No. 4. Sir N. O’Conor to the Marquess 0 } Lansdowne.—(Received September 30.) (No. 600.) My Lord, . Therapia, September 24, ]903 ^ I IN reply to the inquiry contained m your Lordship’s despatch, No. 252, of the 17th instant, I have the honour to report that by Article XV of the An Mo- Turkish treaty of Commerce of 1861, the Sublime Porte reserved to themselves the ri^ht of issuing a general prohibition against the importation into the Ottoman Dominions of gunpowder, cannon, arms of wars, or military stores. An Ordinance prohibiting the importation of arms into Turkey was according v issued on the 7th January, 1863.^ This prohibition is still rigidly enforced, and it is sought even to extend it to sporting guns and ammunition. The case of the order received by Nobel’s Explosives Company relates, however to the importation of explosives into Bulgaria, which Principalitv has, since the treaty of Berlin, acquired a Customs regime distinct from that of Turkey, although it still technically forms part of the Ottoman Dominions. It is difficult to say exactly what attitude the Turkish Government would assume in the matter, ‘but the probability is that they would claim the right, especially under present circumstances to prohibit the importation. * W ith regard to the passage of munitions of war and other explosives through the k.halts, the Sublime Porte addressed a Circular to the Powers on the 17th April, 1888 requesting that the authorization of the Ottoman Government should be applied for every time a ship carrying arms or ammunition destined for a foreign Power had occasion to pass the Straits. TV hen m 1901 the Turkish Government refused to allow the passage of a ship containing tonite for the use of the Danube Commission, I addressed a note to the 101 1 te Q c Ppl ^ 1 1 ng v 1 ' ? ut,10i ; iza i tl0n in the manner requested by the Turkish Government jl 1 T le . . 01 re pl le( i that since that time the passage of explosives through he straits had been absolutely prohibited, and that no exception could be made in mvoui o ic consignment in question. The negotiations w r ere still proceedino' and there was a prospect ot the Porte giving way when I was informed that the Roumanian Government had provided the explosive required. In the same year the German Government were unable to obtain permission for Government ‘ lr0Ugh tbe Straits of a car S° of gunpowder for the Roumanian s ' ’'i tlle . b * y ,,ie arrangement made between Russia and Turkey in September 1891, the steamers of the Russian Volunteer Fleet are allowed to pass through carrying explosives. 1 I have no doubt that if Nobel’s Explosives Company attempt to send the dynamite and gun-cotton m question via the Bosphorus the cargo will be stopped J I have, &amp;c.

His Lordship would loe glad if the necessary instructions could accordingly be sent to the Commander-in-chief on the East Indies Station. &lt; -j i ii The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty will, no doubt, have considered the question of the legal powers under which the Commanders of British or Italian men- of-war are to act in dealing with suspected dhows. On this point I am to offer the (a l^There'is already power for British men-of-war to deal with vessels within the territorial waters of the British Somaliland Protectorate under the Pire-arms Regula tions of 1903, of which I inclose a copy A . , ^ ^ (b.) In order to give similar powers to Italian men-oi-war, draft Regulations, copy of which is also annexed,! have been prepared in this Department, which will be issued shortly by His Majesty’s Commissioner for the Somaliland Protectorate. ^ (c.) To legalize the proceedings of British (or Italian) men-of-war within the territorial waters of the coast under Italian protection is a matter for the Italian Government, who have accordingly been requested to arrange that any measures which may, in contemplation of Italian law, be considered necessary with this view, may be taken forthwith. _ , , o A further set of considerations arises m connection with the proposals made toi checking the export of arms to Somaliland from Muscat. Fire-arms Regulations. f Draft King’s Regulations. [2263*] E(d.) In order to enable His Majesty’s ships to deal with dhows in the territorial waters of Muscat, His Majesty’s Consul at that port will be instructed to move the Sultan to issue a Proclamation prohibiting the export of arms and ammunition to Sokotra or any ports on the African coasts under the protection of Great Britain or Italy, and to confer powers on British men-of-war to deal with and stop such export in the same way as is done, in virtue of the Sultan’s Notification and Proclamation of the 13th January, 1898, in regard to the trade in arms with Persia and Indian fl ports. As soon as this has been arranged, King’s Regulations will be made under the Muscat Order in Council enforcing the provisions of such Notification on British subjects. (&lt;?.) The Sultan of Muscat will further be asked to authorize British and Italian mcn-of-war to deal with dhows flying the Muscat or Arab flag on the high seas. (/.) It is more difficult to suggest by what means legal authority could be con ferred on British and Italian men-of-war to search and deal with dhows flying the British or the Italian flag on the high seas ; or (g.) Vessels on the high seas flying the flag of some other nation. In the case of the seizure of arms in Sokotra, reported by the Resident at Aden in his despatch to the Government of Bombay of the 12th May last, of which a copy accompanied the letter from this Office of the 3rd ultimo, it will be remembered that the dhow which had imported the arms from Muscat was stated to have sailed under the German flag. The Lords Commissioners will be best able to judge whether it may be left to the discretion of the naval officers to deal with cases of this kind on an emergency in such manner as may seem most judicious in the circumstances. His Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome has been instructed again to urge upon the Italian Government the necessity of appointing Agents at the principal ports of the coast under their protection, as affording the only really effective means of preventing the entry of arms and ammunition.

WITH reference to your Excellency’s despatch No. 7G, Africa, of the 27th ultimo, I request you to take an early opportunity of informing the Minister for Eoreign Affairs that the question of the search on the high seas, by either British or Italian men-of-war, of vessels, under whatever Hag, suspected of carrying arms to Somaliland, has been found to involve certain legal difficulties of a technical kind, which require to be further studied and overcome before any definite instructions on the subject can be issued to the Commanders of His Majesty’s ships.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 142 of the 11th instant, I transmit to you herewith, for your confidential information, copy of a letter from the Admiralty, # inclosing correspondence with the Law- Officers of the Crown on the subject of the search on the high seas of dhows suspected of carrying on traffic in arms and ammunition with Somaliland. It was originally suggested by the Government of India, in connection with proposals for checking this traffic when carried on by dhows sailing from Muscat, that the Italian Government should be asked to permit the search of vessels believed to be employed in the arms trade in the territorial waters of the Italian Protectorate on the Somali Coast, and of dhows flying the Italian flag on the high seas. To these measures the Italian Government readily assented, on the understanding that reciprocal rights would be given to Italian men-of-war to search vessels in the territorial w T aters of the British Somaliland Protectorate and dhows flying the British flao* on the liffili seas. His Majesty s Government, entirely recognizing the justice of the reservation, expiessed their willingness to confer the same rights on Italian men-of-w r ar in dealing with ■ vessels under the British flag, or in British waters, as the ships of the British navy w'ould be permitted to exercise as regards vessels under the Italian flag or in Italian w-aters. In pursuance of this undertaking, King’s Regulations have been issued ac Beibera conferring the necessary powers on Italian w-ar ships in the territorial waters of the Inifish Protectorate. The question, however, of searching dhows on the hign seas, wTiether under the British, the Italian, or any other flag, has given rise to legal difficulties, as I explained in my despatch to Sir E. Bertie, above referred to. he opmion of the Law- Officers of the Crown, inclosed in the Admiralty letter sent herewith, is to the effect that, to confer the authority contemplated. Treaties with the Poweis concerned w ould be necessary, as w r ell as an Act of the Imperial Parliament to * No. 9.legalize the search of British vessels, since such authority cannot either be claimed under the Brussels Act, or otherwise exercised, except m case of contraband m im o?war A recourse to special legislation would, however, he open o many objections, fj would moreover,°not be possible to pursue except after much delay.

The arms were being taken to Matra to be shipped in a dhow. After eyidence had been taken by His Majesty’s Consul and myself the matter was reported to the Sultan, who decided that the arms were to be returned to the owners, on e ground that there was nothing to show that the transaction was not a bond jide one. I tnerefore transferred the arms to His Majesty’s Consul to be disposed of as necessary. . As certain of the evidence given led the Consul and myself to infer that there might be more arms m the dhow at Matra, I sent a boat across to search her; the boat brought back her nocada and twenty rifles and some cartridges, but it turned out that the boat searched was another of the same name, and belonged to the same place as the former; and as there was a written permit from the Sultan for them lO carry the arms, the latter was sent back to the dhow, and she was not further interfered with. Copies of the eyidence as taken by the Consul and myself arc inclosed herewith. Ine eyidence was chiefly useful as showing how freely and uncontrolled this traffic ls carried on. The shipper of the arms and the nocada of the dhow have onlv to sav than the arms are to be taken to Sohar or any other place in the Sultan’s territory, - W1 tlI D 0 mi guarantee whatever, the arms will be secure from confiscation, although it may be perfectly well known that there is no market for a large number of amis at piaces m question. With regard to Sohar, this was ascertained by His Majesty s Consul when he visited the place lately in His Majesty’s ship ££ Sphinx.” Past the Quoins this means of evasion will not benefit a dhow; but by the time a uhmv gets to the Quoins all chance of identifying her as carrying arms will have been lost. It is usual, but not necessary, for dhows taking arms from Muscat to have a permit from Lie Sultan. The Sultan has a Treaty with France by which all species of merchandise is to be exported and imported freely, subject only to a 5 per cent, import ( u 7‘ ^ mueforeman excuse for not regulating the traffic, which is, moreover, against mis personal inclination, as he would thereby lose a sum of revenue and miin the ill-will ot the richer merchants at Muscat, to whom he is probably indebted”for iinancial assistance. , ^ Y0U ^ 5 1 ^ 0 ^ e J er ’ respectfully suggest that, without coining to some arrangement rm f 5u / t 1 an fo . r regulating this traffic at Muscat ports, and for increasing the difficulty and lessening the profits of carrying on this illegal trade, we should do little of ourselves to stop it. The arms can be done up so compactly that a considerable rmmhpv r»rm ho co i * thorough search number can be so concealed among other cargo as to make a necessary. Even if we had the necessary number of ships stationed at the Quoins for carrying out this duty, the weather, especially in winter, would often prevent its being done, without first towing the dhow it is intended to search into shelter.Sometimes months will go by without many arms being shipped from Muscat and then owing to a sudden demand caused by political affairs a brisk trade will The arms and ammunition seized by us were of the following description :— 120 Martini rifles (marked P.E.C., Birmingham). ^ They appeared good and serviceable, and all new; 12,000 rounds of ammunition for ditto, solid brass case Kynoch, Birmingham). . , , , Ten double-barrelled guns, 12 bore Clabrough and Johnstone, Birmingham, sighted and meant for bullet and shot; 2,000 cartridges for ditto filled with shot.

You know this firm very well at Muscat. “ This firm has made a contract with an Armenian, by name Tsarkis Terezian, for 1,000,000 rounds of Gras ammunition, to be delivered in Jibuti about the end of the present month; 780,000 rounds arrived in Jibuti some twelve days ago. The cases,** would be marked ‘ A.B.M ’ (A. B. Mesulam), 4 S.T ’ (Serkis Terezian), and it seems ' that Carling refused to put on their mark.” That the firm of E. W. Carling and Co. have not ceased their trade in arms since 1900 is evidenced by the fact that they shipped arms to Muscat by the steam-ship “ Newstead,” and probably to Jibuti in November last, and by the retention of their agent at Harrar, A. B. Mesulam. In face of these it seems inexplicable how the British Custom-house could have issued such a report as it attached, nor that they were unaware of the destination of Messrs. Erank Spryce and Co.’s line. That Messrs. Carling and Co. are not aware that arms shipped by them find their way to the Mullah cannot be believed. They must be well aware of the Abyssinian Eegulations, and that the large quantities shipped by them are far and above any legitimate requirements. The Abyssinian authorities are fully alive to this, and, I am informed, are only awaiting a fair chance to eject A. B. Mesulan summarily from Abyssinia. As regards the Persian Gulf traffic in arms, perusal of the account of an interview that Sir William Lee-Warner had with Mr. Hugh Tweedy on the 30th July, 1899, will show that shippers of arms must necessarily know of the illegal nature of the trade as they resort “ to false manifests and various devices of the trade of which we have heard before.” (Signed) H. M. ABUT), Lieutenant-Colonel, Political Resident and First Assistant Resident, Aden. [Undated. Received in “ Fox,” September 7, 1903.—Y. H. T. W.] Inclosure 4 in No. 12. Note by Mr. A. Hamilton. THE difficulty of regarding with suspicion the precise share borne by Messrs. Carlmg and Co., of London, in the arms trade at Harrar, becomes less after some attention has been given to the condition of the trade and the source and character of its supplies. Within the last few months the regulations of the Abyssinian authorities have een directed towards putting a check upon the indiscriminate traffic in arms which has centred in Harrar. In a measure their effort to regulate the trade has been successful, and owing to the requirements of the new laws, a bond fide trade in arms would be conducted at a dead loss. Healers are licensed, and no native is permitted 0 buy without the sanction of the Court. Between the Abyssinians themselves the entoicement of this lav r is waived wliile a similar indulgence is extended to Arabs. It thus operates principally, if not solely, against the tribes of Somaliland, no natives from across the frontier being permitted to obtain a rifle or to engage in 1110 TlclClG. p T !^ Abyssinian Government does not engage in the trade except as a purchaser 01 military purposes. As an illustration of their kindly offices, several hundred cases of ammunition and rifles ordered by the native dealers previous to the application of e new Regulations are stored in Harrar Custom-house, prohibited from release by special orders. Nevertheless, a very small direct trade in arms continues; the agent of - essm. Carling and Co. supplying native dealers in the city, wRo, however, again in their turn have to comply with the sense and purport of the local laws. This trade is lowevei, legitimate, and so small that it need not be considered, the rifles obtained supplying a genuine w r ant. Respite the comparative limits of this trade, however, no decline is shown in the quantities of rifles dispatched by Carling and Co. to their agency in Harrar. Indeed, ic business in this respect continues to expand, and since there is no falling off of iifles, while the trade in rifles in the city shows no increase, it is obvious that the rifles pass through other channels. There are, however, two means by which any trade c 9 ; 1 Tlie course e witimai ti ^ i others ai purchase are in ji impossil agentk principe inding detectic dealers, of the 1 it also exceed! h respect dealin; 01 res] in Ha direct Mr. ( It is, shov inti deie Iran tec! ma: for Att Mes ente disci to tl is ir nece; Thei of th direc patte 2 am inFr Freni convf to Mi not! sent conin with hare ; Man&lt; and 1 i 1 reni ^ co21 trade can be conducted—the Arabs and the Abyssinians. I do not think that the Abyssinians are concerned in the trade. The exact part which the Arabs play needs elucidation. They are as a class, of course, great dealers in arms, and while they may obtain their supplies in Harrar by legitimate transactions, there is reason to view with suspicion the methods which they take to dispose of them. So many Arabs are the agents of the Mullah and so many ^ others are in touch with his emissaries that the suspicion which attaches itself to the purchasers of the arms reflects with an equally sinister light upon the agent who sells them. Unless this man is a fool—wdiich he is not—and unless Messrs. Carling and Co. are in ignorance of the actual conditions of their trade—a conjecture which it is impossible to believe—while it is again denied by their mail instructions to the Harrar agent by which the London firm reveal a deep interest in their business in Harrar, the principals and their agents know' that there is the strongest probability of these rifles finding their way into the camp of the Mullah. Suspicion, and suspicion only—since detection is quite impossible—points to the connivance of M. Mesulam with the Arab dealers, as also of the direct illicit association of these Arab dealers with the agents of the Mullah. Moreover, if suspicion centres on the Harrar agent of Carling and Co., it also falls on the firm itself, whose consistent support of a trade based upon such exceedingly dubious foundation is altogether discreditable. In view of the fact that Carling and Co. enjoy some little reputation as a firm of respectability, it is necessary to say that a telegram, which was cited from Aden, dealino* with the arms question, was dispatched from Harrar itself. ' The atmosphere of respectability which distinguishes the firm in London is not very easily appreciated in Harrar. My attention during my sojourn in Harrar at the British Consulate, w~as directed to the elemental features in the arms traffic by the Consul himself. Mr. Gerilimato has, I understand, endeavoured to effect the detection of the business. It is, of course, a work of supreme difficulty, local conditions permitting, as T have shown, the importation of arms in the first place; their sale by Mesulam to the Arabs in the second place. The existence of these conditions supplies at the same time the defence necessary to Mesulam. He can, and does, of course, rest on the simple transaction between himself and the Arabs. Morally, an irregular proceeding, technically, and legally, an unassailable proceeding, it is difficult to turn away the man since he breaks no law; it is difficult out of social and general considerations for the Consul to move officially. Nevertheless, the British Consuls and the Italian Attache are convinced of the absolute correctness of any view which couples Mesulam with the illicit traffic in arms, while they denounce the unscrupulous enterprise of Carling and Co. _ , „ , , , , The British Consul was acquainted with the exact words of ^ the despatch under discussion, even prompting the message, in the hope that attention wmuld be drawn to the matter. There is much that is possible to do from London, wTien action is impossible at Harrar, but it is to be hoped that insistence upon the vital necessitv of checking any passage of arms between Jibuti and Harrar will be made. The arms in question are Gras and Mauser rifles shipped at Marseilles by the ships of the Bucknall and Persian Lines (agents, Frank Stryce and Co.), and consigned direct to Harrar and Jibuti. The ammunition is for the small and large bore patterns^ of rifles.^ ^ need of the different rifles in use ; a single cartridge sells for 2 annas. In this respect it may be necessary to add that I took part in a conversation in French between the British Consul, Mesulam, an Italian merchant, the agent of the French Railway, and two German merchants one night in the Harrar Club. Ihe conversation turned upon the contents of a letter which Carling and Co. had written to Mesulam demanding to know', since cartridges sold at 2 annas each, why he had not by then disposed of the very large consignment of ammunition which they had sent lately to him. I understood that 2,000,000 cartridges had been sent, but the comments upon the letter were instructive, and suggested that every one was familiar with the fact that to dispose of this large quantity other than legitimate means would ^ aV&lt; i understand that Mesulam is the son of an Armenian merchant who settled in Manchester and became naturalized. Mesulam is possibly years old, quite white, and looks exactly like an Englishman. He was born in Manchester, and speaks French English, German, Arabic, Hindustani, Harran, Abyssinian, &amp;c. He is not, of course, cold-shouldered in Harrar, except so far as the small official community [2263] G22 there can render possible. The man is carrying out the work assigned to him ; it is the firm who primarily should suffer. It is quite impossible to believe that Carling and Co. are in ignorance of the ultimate destination of the rifles which their agent sells to the Arabs. There is no market but that contained in this illicit trade ; in Somaliland between the Arab dealers and the Somalis, in Arabia between the Arab dealers and the tribes in the interior. The system which prevails in Harrar exists equally in Jibuti, where laws (?) are supposed to operate against any local traffic in weapons. The French do not permit the sale of rifles to natives who are under French protection, hut there is nothing to prevent those same natives buying rifles if they show they are to he used within the area of French Protectorate. If the French authorities of Jibuti be substituted for the Abyssinian officials in Harrar, there is so little to distinguish between the oppor tunities which either centre affords for illicit traffic. Provided that local regulations are observed, no questions are asked. It is not altogether without interest to say that no importer other than Carling and Co. is concerned in the Harrar trade in rifles; about Jibuti the French may import from other quarters, but I think that Carling and Co. are equally interested in this business in the French port.

As regards the trade in arms and ammunition with the Persian Gulf, our informa tion here is that they are imported and landed at Muscat, Bushire, Bunder Abbas, and Lingah by Francis limes and Co. and Carling and Co., principally by the former firm. Francis Times and Co. are a firm of three partners, viz., Francis Times, of England, Nasserwanji Dossabhoy Francis, and Derabji Edalji Dharwar, the two latter of Bombay. Nasserwanji generally trades between England and Persian Gulf, and has an office at Bushire, while Times and Dharwar remain in England. Nasserwanji is now also in England. Francis Times and Co. are also Commission Agents, and have an agent in Bombay, by name Dadabhi Chethia, a Parsee, and an indent merchant, whose office is in Hornby Road, Fort. The arms and ammunition are sent to the Gulf by the following steamers : “Turkestan,” “ Afghanistan,” “ Laristan,” “ Baluchistan,” and the names of the persons engaged in this trade in the Persian Gulf are as under:— Bunder Abbas. 1.

I found the Italian Commandino Officeis always most ready to help me m any steps proposed, and to accompany anv British ship into Italian territorial waters ; but since the raid on Baraida they have had the most positive orders from Rome that they are not to land a single man for the purposes of search. 6 tne -Coa^t^hnfh C ° nte d 4 &lt; ‘7 0ltUrn0 ^ and Ca P tain Giuseppe Canetti, of Goatit both recognized the futility of attempting to stop the arms traffic by shins 11 y, if it really existed (for they would never admit that it did), and each of them in ormed me that he had m turn recommended the transfer of at least two of the armed c!Z S 3 pl 7 ed , at Ma ' s 7 ah . to be employed as coast-guard cruisers on the Somali Coast, and also m a small force (two companies of native troops) to regulate and supervise tarirs P Ltnd roads 80 “ ^ Patr01 ^ !n the nei g h bourhood of the , This ', ou ! d , be P lacin g the Somaliland Coast under a similar system and the omy one which, m my opinion, can stop the illicit trade in arms without the declaration of a regular blockade which would necessitate far more ships than are ever likely to be thonzed for the purpose Without a regular blockade I do not think ships alone will L°P 'n ai ™ s traffio sheltered as it is by foreign flags and territorial waters. As an illustration of the ease with which arms can be run from dhows even in t ie neighbourhood of Aden, it was ascertained by the Political Agent at Aden and I ' ■ - V ] ,LI1 own ln(er P i 'utei', that a large quantity of arms were lying on the wharf at armed ™n to th^ A?abian 00^7 An a ,7 an cam f to Has Imram to receive them, and His Majestvs shin 01 ^? 1Se Proceeded thither to watch the coast.

Abyssinia, having adhered to the General Act of the Brussels Slave Trade Conference, is entitled under its terms to receive arms for the use of its authorities, though not for sale, and the Government of India recognize, therefore, that it may not be possible for Her Majesty s Government to take immediately any steps in the matter; but they think it desirable to invite attention to the inconvenience, and even danger, which may not improbably result from the possession of large quantities of arms by the Abyssinians, more especially now that the policy of Abyssinia is no longer controlled by Italian influence. 3. The introduction of arms and ammunition on an extended scale in the * territories adjacent to the French and English Protectorates on the Somali Coast constitutes a danger alike to both Powers by imperilling the security of their occupation, and the maintenance ot peace in the vicinity of their Protectorates ; and on these grounds Loid Cross would suggest that representations be made to the French Govern ment in view to placing some restrictions on the consignments of arms, &amp;c., destined for Abyssinia and Shoa. 4.

To The Right Hon’ble VISCOUNT CROSS, G.C.B., Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Simla, the 7th October 1891. My Lord, We have recently had under consideration certain reports from the Political Officers on the Somali Coast regarding the importation of large quanti ties of arms into Shoa and Abyssinia from the French port of Jibuti; and we ^ n . . have now the honour to forward, for the From the Secretary to the Government of # n tt li/f • Bombay, Political Department, No. 617^, dated the iniOrm&amp;tlOIl Ol xi6r JM&amp;JCSty S IjOVGril- nth August i89i, with enclosures. ment, 8 l copy of the letter marginally cited, and to invite especial attention to the letter No. 1199 of the 30th July 1891, from the Political Agent and Consul, Somali Coast, which forms an enclosure to it. 2. The information at our disposal goes to show that a trade in arms between Jibuti and Harrar has existed since 1889. It would appear that of late this trade has largely increased, and we consider that, by placing the Abissi nians in possession of large quantities of arms, it may constitute a serious menace to the security of our Somali Coast Protectorate, and may tend to defeat the declared policy of the Powers in the matter of the sup pression of the slave-trade. It must be remembered that at present any immediate advantage, political or commercial, which may be derivable from the trade in arms, is reaped exclusively by the French at Jibuti, while t le inconvenient consequences, should such ensue, will m all probability be tele mainly by us. 3. In Her Majesty’s letter to King Menelek, dated the ?0th February 1890, it was stated that the arrangement arrived at between the British and French Governments in February 1888, for the restriction of the importation of arms, was no longer in force as regarded arms destined for the dommions of the King of Abyssinia. Again, in his letter No. 228, dated the lot November 1890, to Her Majesty’s Agent and Consul-Geneial, Cano, the Marquis of Salisbury explained that Abyssinia had adhered to the Geneial Act of the Brussels Slave-Trade Cunferenee, and was therefore, undei it, entitled to leeeive arms for the use of its authonties though not for sale. We recognise, therefore, that it may not be possible for Hei Majesty G - ernment to take immediately any effective steps m the mattel ^ it desirable to invite attention to the inconvenience and even dan^ei which may^ I f I [ 2 ] not improbably result from tbe possession of large quantities of ^ arms by the Abyssinians, more especially now that the policy of Abyssinia is no longer controlled by Italian influence. The recent communication addressed by Menelek to the Powers, followed as it has been by the advance of Abyssinian troops from Qarrar towards Zaila, shows that the danger is not unlikely to become pressing in the near future. 4. The bearing of this question upon that of the slave-trade has no doubt been perceived by Her Majesty’s Government. It is true, on the one hand, that Menelek has urged his wish to suppress that trade as a reason for permitting the importation of arms into his territories. On the other hand we notice that, when the Prench Government was informed in 1890 that a limited consignment of arms had been permitted at the request of the Italian Government to pass through Zaila for Harrar, M. Hanotaux, to whom the communication was made, * Tide paragraph 2 of Confidential Despatch o-v'nT*p&lt; 5 «jprl^ mivnrise that Her ]Vlaiestv , S No. 25, dated the 23rd January 1890 , from Her CXpiCSSeQ SUipilSe Uldt XlCl^ majesty S Majesty’s Ambassador at Paris to the Secretary of Government should ha VC given their state for Foreign Affairs. consent to what he stated to be the intro duction of weapons which would fall into the hands of men engaged in the capture and exportation of slaves.” We are not in a position to judge of the sincerity of the desire of the King of Abyssinia for the suppression of the slave-trade, but in any case it appears to us to be far from unlikely that a considerable proportion of the arms recently imported in such large quantities may eventually fall into the hands of those who will use them in furtherance of the slave-trade and not for its suj»pression.

External. nclosures of a letter to Eer Majesty’s Secretary of State for India No. 169j dated the 7th October 1891.No. 6179, dated Bombay Castle, the lltb August 1891. From—W. Lee-Warner, Esq., Secretary to the Govt, of Bombay, Political Dept., To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of this Office No. 5977, dated 4th instant, I am directed No. ^ dated the 2nd August 1891, and to forward, for the information of the enclosures. Governor-General in Council, copies of the letters marginally noted which have been received from the Political Resident at Aden. 2. I am to add that any remarks which the Government of Bombay may desire to make in connection with them will, if necessary, he communicated after the letters have been considered by Government. No. dated Aden Residency, the 2nd August 1891. Letter No. 1199 from the Political Agent and Consul, Somali Coast, dated 30th July 1891, submitted, with compliments, to the Secretary to Government, Political Department, Bombay X. With reference to Colonel Stace’s paragraph 2, hearing on the, announcement that King Menelek had informed the powers that the “ Gadabursi ” and “ Hahr Awal ” were his subjects. IX. Government are aware that under the Supplementary General Treaty of 1886, the Whole of the Hahr Awal tribe are brought “ under the protection of Her Majesty the Queen-Empress.” XII,—The Gadahursi, however, up to the present are only bound to us under the terms of the “agreement” concluded with them which was ratified by the Governor-General in Council on the 25th February 1885, and although thev have since been continually urging to he taken under Her Ma]esty s protection, the Government of India have not deemed that desirable. IV I presume due notice will be taken of King Menelek’s announce ment. I cannot but help thinking that French influence has been at work with Kins’ Menelek to induce him to make the announcement alluded to, as it the tribes in question were under the King instead of under British Protection : the diverting of all trading caravans from Zaila to Jibuti would he com paratively an easy business. V —It is, however, satisfactory to learn that, as far as Ras Makunan is aware, no invasion of these tribes is intended. Nor have any further complaints jof any molestation been received from the tribes themselves. (Sd.) John Jopp, Brigadier-General, BolUical Resident, Aden. No. 1199, dated Aden, the 30th July 1891. From—C olonel E. V. Stage, Political Agent and Consul, Somali Coast, To The Political Resident, Aden. With reference to paragraph 5 of my letter N°. 1169, dated 26th instant ^ ^ forwarded to Government with your JNo. ot z/tn instant I have the honour to enclose copies of my letters, dated, respectively, 1 st and TtMnstant, to Ras Makunan, and also copy of a translation of a renlv iust received from him. . , 2 It will be observed that Makunan writes in a friendly manner, but he makes^the strange statement that King Menelek has informed the Europeanpowers that the Gadabursi and Habr Awal are his subjects. I conclude that he refers to the letters addressed to the sovereigns of Europe, the despatch of which was reported in my No. 992, dated 18th June 1891. The accusations against the Gadabursi are gross exaggerations. 3. As it is well-known that the pretensions of the Abyssinians are un limited, I am informed that they assert Jerusalem and Khartoum to be theirs, but little importance might be attached to the assertion of sover eignty ; but the announcement of the same to the European powers at the present moment is significant, and especially of importance with reference to any contemplated delimitation of the British and Italian boundary on the south of the Somali Coast Protectorate. It seems possible that King Menelek, hopeless of consolidating his power in northern Abyssinia, may be desirous of turning his attention to the west. His army received a severe check, I believe, some ten or twelve years ago in the south from the Northern Arosi Gallas. It appears to me that tiie possession by the Abyssinians of great quantities of rifies now is a factor to be taken note of as well as the very arrogant and impulsive character of the nation. I am informed that con siderable quantities of rifles are still being sent to Abyssinia via Jibuti, and it is also asserted, machine-guns; this latter statement I have henrd from several sources. 4. The object of my first letter to Makunan is self-evident: the reason of writing the second was that he siddressed a letter (translation enclosed) to the Assistant Resident, Berbera, asking about a fort or building erected somewhere in Somali land. Dated the 1st July 1891. From— Colonel E. V, Stage, Political Agent and Consul, Somali Coast, To— Has Makunan, Governor of Harrar. After compliments .—We hear that you have arrived at Harrar and congratulate you on your safe arrival, and trust that you are in the best of health. We have heard with much regret that there has been some scarcity at Harrar, and that some of the people have suffered in consequence. The Gadabursi have been in fear that some of the soldiery from Harrar might enter their country, and now we understand that the Jibril Abokr tribe of the Habr Awal are similarly disturbed. We are thoroughly convinced of the sincere friendship of King Menelek and yourself towards the British Government, and also convinced that you would not countenance any inroad into the territories of tribes which have treaty engagements with the British Government, and we therefore write to you, relying on your friendship, to ask you to be kind enough to restrain any persons who may have any design to enter such countries with any hostile intent. T\ e beg you to favour us with an early reply to this by the special messenger sent, and at the same time receive the assurance of our continued friendship and esteem, and we trust to hear always good news of you. Dated the 7th July 1891. From— Colonel E. V. Stage, Political Agent and Consul, Somali Coast, To— Ras Makunan, Governor of Harrar. After compliments.—I have received your letter of 12th Sani 1883, which was sent to me by the Assistant Resident, Berbera, in w r hich you ask about a fort or building being erected in Somali land, and kindly express yourself m a friendly manner to the British Government. I hasten to assure you 2that I have no knowledge whatever of any fort or building being erected anywhere in Somali land by any one. Certainly, none such is being erected by our knowledge or consent. You know the Somalis; they are not likely to build forts. As for the British Government its position is the same as it has been ; it occupies the ports and has under its protection certain Somali tribes, no change has been made whatever. If you hear any more of this please let me know. Certainly no measures unfriendly to you will be helped or approved by us in any way. We feel much obliged for your friendly sentiments expressed towards the British Government. We reciprocate them, and shall always be most glad to hear of your welfare and prosperity in all things. Dated the 5th Amli 1883. * p rom — R a s Makunan, Amir of Harrar and its Dependencies, To— Colonel E. Y. Stage, Political Agent and Consul, Somali Coast. After compliments .—We have received your letter, and we are obliged and highly pleased for your friendship towards His Highness King Menelek. Be it known to Your Excellency that friendship, love and amity will continue between you and us for evei\ Be sure that nothing displeasing to you will be ever done by us except what is pleasing. As for the Gadabursi, they are always molesting and looting the travellers who come to Harrar. This we do not hide from you. The doings ot this tribe are much injurious and troublesome to all the people as they loot the travellers without cause. As regards what you wrote appertaining to an intended attack by some of our soldiers against them (Gadabursi), we are not aware of it because we were absent. Before taking such steps, we would consult you. As for the Gadabursi and a part of the Habr Awal being subjects His Highness Negus Menelek wrote to the European poweis in his letters that they were subjects of King Tobyaur (of Ethiopia), therefore we cannot reply on this subject without asking His Highness King Menelek, as he alone communicates with the powers and makes the limits. May you remain, &amp;c. Dated the 12th Sani 1883. p roin —p t AS Makunan, Amir of Harrar and its Dependencies, To—The British Commandant. After compliments.—We hear of some building being made m tbe direction of Harrar by tbe aid of some Europeans m Somali land. We do not know the reasons for the same. We feel confident in your sincere friend- ship, and that when such work is required by you for the benefit of both sides, you would inform us about it. Now we did not believe the news and write you this to enouire about your health, and to inform us whether the fact is true or not If it is true what is your intention in building in that place, because vou know that the people of this country are ignorant and barbarians, and probably they will molest and harm the Europeans without our knowledge, and thereby we will be annoyed with you for not intormmg us previously. We hope that you will please explain the facts to us. Whatever service you require which is good to bath of us we will assist, so that, no risk will occur in future and that peace may prevail in the country and on the road. May you remain protected, and we pray God to increase your respect, and that friendship may exist between us for ever. 3</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000365.0x0003e5_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/32</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000365.0x0003e5</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/32</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 869/1904 Pt 1 'Arms Traffic: - Red Sea, Africa &amp; Aden'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1902/1906</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-09-19T18:27:05</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (286 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.
