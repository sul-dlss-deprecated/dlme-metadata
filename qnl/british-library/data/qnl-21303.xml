The following is a brief sketch of the more salient features of the history of Persia during the past 20 years with special reference to Khurasan. 1911—^12 — 13 .—During this period Russia-, profiting by the state of chaos in Persia which had- been brought about ky_ the various abortive efforts of the ex-Shah Muhammad Ali to regain the throne, had on one pretext’ or another increased her garrisons in Northern Persia' till hy the end of 1913, there was a total of 14,000 Ku'ssian trobps' in that area. Persia was on the verge of ruin, her treasury was empty, she had no military forces available to suppress disorders, or to collect revenue, and there was no strong leader to direct efforts to reform. During the winter- of- 1911-12, the Russians seized the pretext of some slight unrest in Meshed to add to the Cossack squadron, already there, the 1st Semirechia Cossack battery, and an infantry battalion, at the 1 saftie time placing -| battalion and some cavalry at Kuchan. During the spring of 1912, the intrigues of an ag&amp;nt pro vocateur, Yusuf Herati, undoubtedly secretly inspired by the Russian local Consular authorities, resulted 1 in serious disorder at Meshed, and on the 12th March Of that’ year, with no previous warning, the Russian troops’ surrounded 1 , bombarded,, and- captured the Shrine of Imtaii Raz« r the headquarters of the marauding gang; Two Russian sdldierg were wounded during the operations;- some 70 Persians killed, and about twice the number, mostly innocent wor2 shippers of_ both sexes, wounded. If this feat of arms was really intended to arouse the fanatical feelings of the resuS’ln^ p bnng ° n a . conflict which would have resulted in the Russian occupation of Khurasan, it signally failed m this object, and the Persians remained stunned and cowed by the sudden blow. Naturally the deepest resentment has endured to this day and the misfortunes ol Russia are popularly attributed to Divine punishment tor the crime. The majority of the Russian troops were withdrawn a er m the year, but the 1 st Semirechia Cossacks w*ere retained at Meshed, Kuchan, and posts on the Meshed- Askhabad road, where they were undoubtedly useful against the brigands, who after several years of internal security began to infest this highway. 1914—1918.—After the outbreak of the Great War the Russian force in Khurasan was augmented by the arrival of the 2 nd Semirechia Cossacks, and later by a detach ment of militia infantry. A mountain battery and some regular infantry who were to have joined the Khurasan force in 1916 were diverted to other theatres of war. • 5 1 August ms, German intrigues in Persia culminated m the despatch of the German artillery officer Niedermeyer with a mixed German and Turkish mission and armed escort to Afghanistan, with the object of inducing the Amir to cast m his lot against the Allies. The Cossacks were successful m capturing much of the transport and some outlying members of this party near Kain, but the chief members succeeded in reaching Herat, and subse- quently _ Kabul, in safety. Early in 1916, in connection with similar anti-German measures in other parts of Persia a British General Staff Officer was despatched to Meshed to co-operate with the Russian force, assist them with intelligence, act as liaison with British troops to the south, and check as far as possible the wholesale escape to Persia of German and Austrian prisoners of war interned in luikistan. At this period, with the object of confining the Germans already in Afghanistan to that country, and of preventing the advent of similar bands, a cordon of Russian troops had been pushed south to Rum (north of Birjand) whence a British _ cordon carried on the line southwards to the Indian frontier. The measures taken were successful m securing the capture of a number of German and Turkish agents, and of not a few noted Indian seditionists. Little3 co-operation was at first afiorded by the Persian authorities, some of whom in 1915 were actively engaged in facilitat ing the escape of enemy war prisoners, but considerable improvement in their attitude was subsequently manifested. During 1916, much trouble was caused in the Sarhad region by the^ Damani tribe, of which a sharp little cam- paipi by Dritish troops, resulting in the subjugation of the malcontents, was the outcome. Early in 1917, the 2nd bemirechia Cossacks were withdrawn in order to partici pate in Russian punitive measures against the Yamut -Turkomans in the Asterabad area and in the Gurgan and Atrek regions, and the militia left for Turkistan some what later. W ith the outbreak of the Russian revolution rapid de moralisation _ of the remaining Cossacks set in. Although anti-Bolshevik in attitude, discipline quickly disappeared, and ^ early in 1918, the men insisted on returning to Semirechia to protect their homes. On arrival at Askhabad they Mere promptly disarmed by the # Bolsheviks, and the same fate befell the 2 nd Semirechia regiment on their return to Turkistan from Asterabad. Khurasan was thus left to anarchy and to the unchecked movements of enemy bodies and agents, and to remedy this state of affairs British troops (in the first instance, the 19th Punjabis and the 28th Light Cavalry) were pushed up to Meshed in March 1918. In July a Military Mission, with the main object of preventing German and Turkish penetration to Afghanistan through Trans-Caspia and Khurasan, was formed at Meshed. In the same month a rising in Trans-Caspia of Russian and Turkoman elements against Bolshevik tyranny occurred, and met with some initial success. The Bolsheviks, however, speedly reinforced from Tashkent, pressed back their ill-organised opponents from the Oxus to the vicinity of Merv, and in August 1918, the Trans-Caspian Provisional Government invoked British _ assistance, for which sanction was received. In a succession of engagements in Trans- Caspia the 19th Punjabis and 28th Light Cavalry, subsequently reinforced by British infantry 'and artillery from the North Persian Force, were instrumental in saving the situation for the Trans-Caspian forces, and in placing the local defeat of the Bolshevik forces within their grasp. In April of 1919, the British force was, for reasons of major policy, withdrawn to Khurasan. The Trans-Caspians were reinforced by elements from Denikin’s forces from4 across the Caspian, but failed to stem the tide of Bolshevik aggression, and in July 1919 were ejected from Askhabad. Aiter various vicissitudes Krasnovodsk was captured by the Bolsheviks in February 1920. The remnants of the Trans- Caspian force fled to Petrovsk and all organised resistance to Bolshevik arms in Trans-Caspia was at an e*id. . During 1919, the protection of Khurasan from Bolshevik inroads was the main mission of our force, and with this object, as also to afford moral assistance to the Trans-Cas, pians, Bajgiran, the frontier point on the Askhabad-Meshed road, w T as held by our advanced troops, with supportino' bodies at Kuchan and Meshed. By the outbreak of the Afghan war in May the British force was placed in a poten- tialiy precarious position, but, as events proved, the Bolsheviks _were occupied in their offensive againsfl the 1 rans-Caspians, and Afghan troops at Herat remained in active. A mounted levy of 300 men was raised at Kuchan from Kurds by the Military Mission, a levy of Hazaras, mainly infantry, but with a proportion of mounted men, in Khurasan, and the numbers of the existing Seistan levy (cavalry camelry, and infantry) were increased. The two latter formations Wfere raised under the orders of the Consular authorities of the provinces concerned. fn the autumn of 1919-21, Indian units who had been serving for- nearly 5 years in East Persia returned to India on relief by others, and at the end of 1919, regular troops at and north of Meshed consisted of 1 cavalry regiment, 2 infantry battalions, a mountain battery, with medical and supply details. Troops were accommodated in a hutted encampment which was completed by the winter. The final defeat of the Trans-Caspians in February 1920 allowed the Bolsheviks to turn their undivided attention to Khurasan, and although the presence of the British force (much exaggerated in strength by their intelligence reports) inspired a wholesome respect, more insidious measures were not excluded.. The success of propaganda ®, nd the distribution of arms among the Turkomans within the Korth-East Persian border was rendered nugatory by the continual inter-tribal squabbles among these sections^ A more promising field was found among the Kurds to the of Kuchan, and a well-known and determined ex- oivtiaw, Khuda Verdi Khan- (Kbuddu,), was induced by gifts, ox money ana arms, and by the- loan of expert machine-5 gunnel's, to inaugurate a local rising which, invested with the character of a national movement for liberty, might furnish the Bolsheviks with a pretext for armed interven tion on a large scale. A naturally strong position was occupied in July 1920 at Grilyan near Shirvan by some hundreds of hie armed adherents, assisted by Bolshevik machine-gunners, and the Persian Government was set at defiance. A sharp brush with our troops at the frontier post of Jiristan, to the west of Bajgiran, exerted a depressing effect on his adherents, and the despatch of a movable column of our troops from Meshed to Kuchan strengthened the hands of the Persian force collected against the outlaw. Gilyan was taken by the Persian force, not without some loss,' in August, Khuddu fled to Trans-Caspia &gt; and a revolutionary movement which was fraught with potentially serious consequences was nipped in the bud. In the autumn of 1920 our forces Were recalled to India, however l^- squadrons of cavalry remained at Meshed and Kuchan, and squadron at Seistan. In January and February of 1921, the Kurd and Khurasan levies were disbanded, attd at the end of March the Military Mission and the cavalry were withdrawn to India; the pre-war status of the Consulate General with a small escort, and the establishment of the Military Attache was reverted to. The prospects of a Bolshevik invasion of Khurasan, which during the preceding year had been freely mooted, were, in the early part of 1921, rendered less probable by the conclusion of the Trade Agreement between the Soviet Republic and Persia, and in April a Bolshevik Minister for Tehran arrived at Meshed from Trans-Caspia. This Minister brought with him a considerable Bolshevik following hut the Persian Government issued orders to Meshed that the majority of these followers should not cross the frontier. They were, however, subsequently allowed to enter Persia. “ In April, Zabardast Khan, a Chief of Darreh Jaz, re belled against the Central Government and occupied the main passes. A punitive force was sent from Meshed and it succeeded in effecting the surrender of Zabardast Khan’s followers. Muhammadabad, the capital of the Sub- Province, was occupied and Martial Law was declared 3n the Sub-Provinces of Shirvan, Bajgiran and Darreh Jaz. Zabardast Khan fled to Russia with his family and 4$6 followers. _ His chief supporter Mursal Sadiqov, brother of the notorious Khuddu Verdi, was executed in Meshed on the 14th May.” Khuddu, who since his repulse had been intermittently collecting adherents for a reputed second attempt, returned to Khurasan in April, was induced to make his submission, and was conveyed imder escort to Meshed. He and his brother Allah Verdi were executed in June 1921. For tsome time after the Persian coup d'etat at Tehran early in 1921, there were no direct consequences in Khurasan, but in April the Governor-General, Qavvam-us- Saltaneh, was arrested by the Commander of the Gendar merie at Meshed, and was despatched under escort to the capital, where he w r as imprisoned. Under orders from Zia-ud-din’s cabinet all the Military cadres were absorbed into the Gendarmerie force, which considerably increased the powet of Colonel Muhammad Taqi Khan, the Commander of the Gendarmerie at Meshed, who styled himself “ Commander-in-Chief of all the forces in Khurasan ” and who exercised full control over the Province as a de facto “ Military Governor-General of Khurasan, by arresting various subordinate officials ”. In the beginning of May the Persian Cossack Commander Reza Khan (now Reza Shah) was made War Minister. He was instrumental in the removal of the Premier, Syed Zia-ud-din, who fled to Baghdad. Qavvam-us-Salta,neh, who had been sent to prison in Tehran from Meshed was re leased and made Premier in June 1921. The task of re organising the Persian Army which had been taken in hand by Zia-ud-din before, now came to a standstill. Rebellion of^ Muhammad Taqi .—The news of Reza Khan s ^ coup d etat was received w r ith amazement every where in the Province and the immediate effect of the change was the abrogation by telegraphic orders from Tehran of the scheme of reforms initiated by Zia-ud-din in Khurasan. Although these orders were received with much satisfaction by the majority of the people of Meshed —Colonel Muhammad Taqi hipiself was naturally much displeased and refused to comply. He arrested various personages concerned in the previous administration, includ ing the Governor-General and the Chief' Telegraph Official. One of his first acts w r as to send circular telegrams to his officers stationed in outlying distriets asking °them if he could count on their support. To these he rgoeived favour-T able replies, and the subversion of the loyalty of these officers from the Central Government was the first step to rebellion. Recruiting, which had been started sometime before, continued briskly especially in Kuchan and Sabzawar and the Gendarmerie force was considerably in creased. By the end of May its total strength was estimated at 3,270 men. In the meantime Bolshevik agents were not slow in seizing this opportunity to further their propaganda^ activi ties and leaflets headed “ The Gendarmerie’s Will ” were found in the Gendarmerie Barracks in Meshed, while quan tities of similar leaflets were seized on the frontier at Bajgiran. On the 22nd June, Kuchan was reinforced as a precautionary measure against the return of Zabardast Khan into Persian territory by 100 mounted and 200 dis mounted Gendarmerie with 3 Machine Guns. In July, the orders to merge all Military formations into the Gendarmerie force were rescinded. Najd-us-Saltaneh, the acting Governor-General, resigned and was replaced by Nizam-us-Saltaneh, a Bakhtiari chief. In the middle of August, Colonel Gfeerup, the Swedish chief of the Persian Gendarmerie tvho was en route to Meshed to replace Muhammad Taqi by another officer, was turned back to Tehran from Sharifabad. A modus vivendi between Colonel Muhammad Taqi and the Persian Govern ment was arranged by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul- General in Khurasan. Muhammad Taqi Khan stipulated that he should be permitted to leave the country for Europe and that guarantees should be given for the immunity from reprisals of those who had supported him. These condi tions were accepted by the Persian Government, but un fortunately the prospect of his leaving Persia did not appea. to his subordinate officers, who threatened to resign forth with if Colonel Muhammad Taqi persisted in his proposal to leave Persia. About this time Reza Khan arranged to have the Gendarmerie transferred from the Ministry of Interior to the Ministry of War, and it was decided to send an ex peditionary force against Muhammad Taqi. The first batch of 800 men left Tehran for Shahrud on 30th August and the 2nd batch of 600 on the 9th September The total strength of the Gendarmerie in Khurasan on 1st September was about 3,800 of all arms.'8 Muhammad Taqi Khan was now faced with a n 6 w dlffh culty for the tribesmen under Shuja-ul-Mulk and Salaf Khan, Babich, in the area of Turbat-i-Haidari—Turbat-i- Shaikh Jam and Kariz refused to recognise his authority, and he was compelled to take punitive measures against them. These tribes were crushed by the Gendarmerie forces which operated from Turbat-i-Haidari. On the 28th September, the Sub-Provinces of Bujnurd, Shirvan^ and Kuchan revolted against Muhammad Taqi, Sardar-i-Muazziz of Bujnurd, Wali Khan and Parajullah Khan, a Chieftain of Shirvan, were the leading men who raised the revolt against him on behalf of the Central Gov- ernment. They promptly occupied Kuchan. Muhammad Taqi himself proceeded to the Kuchan front to take charge of the operations, but on the 3rd October he was engaged by rebel Kurds at Jafarabad, 13 miles east of Kuchan, where he was surrounded and killed. The Gendar merie in Bajgiran, Darreh Jaz and Kalat-i-Nadri were over powered by the local tribesmen who assumed charge of the situation. In October, immediately following the death of Muham mad Taqi Khan, the Military control of Khurasan was transferred from the Commander of the Gendarmerie to Husain Aqa Mir Panj, an officer of the Persian Cossack Division. In the same month, the Bolshevik Consulate-General was established in Khurasan and the first Consul-General Karim Hakimov, a Muhammadan, arrived in Meshed on the 1 st December. In December, the Gendarmerie was abolished. Military Reforms, 1922.—In January 1922, orders were received by Husain Aqa Mir Panj, General Officer Com manding the troops in Khurasan, from Reza Khan, the War Minister, effecting the following reforms: — (*) (*) The na me “ Cossack ” was to be abolished and the troops to be called “ Qushun ”. (ii) The rank and file were to be known as “ Sarbaz u ., (in) Companies to be called “ Guruhan (iv) A Squadron—“ Bahadur 5 ’. (v) Brigade—Tip ” (Brigadier—“ Sartip 'J, (li) Division - Laskar ” (Divisional Commander- - “ Amir-i-Lashkar ”).9 The Army in Persia was divided into five divisions and an independent Brigade and the garrison of Khurasan (one Division) was given the name of “ Lashkar-i'-Sharq ” (Eastern Division). This Division, which was under Husain Aqa as General Officer Commanding and Prince Muhammad Husain Mirza as Chief of Staff, was to consist of 6,000 of all arms with Headquarters at Meshed and was to be dis tributed as follows :— Meshed 2,000 Kuchan 750 Bujnurd 300 Aster ah ad ....... 500 Shahrud 300 Sabzawar 150 Turbat-i-Haidari 300 Birjand and Seistan 750 Total . 5,050 The Military Command of Asterabad was however transferred to the Tehran Division in March 1922, when Husain Aqa was confirmed as “ Amir-i-Lashkar ” (Divisional Commander) of the Eastern Persian Division. In the month of April, the reorganisation of the Amnieh (road guards) took plaeO and their strength was reduced from 1,200 to 350. Early in May, orders were issued from the capital that the total strength of the Khurasan forces was not to exceed 3,000 men. Nizam-us-Saltaneh, the Governor-General, who was not on good terms with the Amir-i-Laskar, was recalled to Tehran and Muqbil-us-Saltaneh officiated for him. Sardar-i-Asad was then appointed Governor-General and assumed charge on the 18th May 1923. In January 1923, the Amir-i-Lashk^r’s proposal to number the brigades (Meshed and Seistan) as No. 1 and No. 2 respectively was sanctioned by the War Minister. In the autumn of 1923, the whole divisional area was inspected by Army Headquarters and in November sanction was given to increase the 2nd Brigade (Seistan) to a total strength of 2,300, out of which 500 men were to be quartered in Kha&amp;h and 150 men in Dehana Baghi.11 latter s influence in the District his Deputy Governors were* dismissed and replaced by men selected by the troops Tho 1 urkomans thereupon became more turbulent and refused +v!T e p der an y P lor e arms or to pay revenue to the Cential Government. Shortly after this Turkoman, raiders became active on the Tehran Meshed road. At % end of June, Sarhang (Colonel) Mehdi Khan, actmg without the authority of the General Officer Com manding, left Bujnurd with 100 troops for Gunbad-i-Qabus and moved m the direction of Kara Kala. En route he eaptuied 70 1 urkomans whom he executed as robbers. This affam so incensed the Turkomans that on July 5 th a party about 2,500 strong attacked and defeated Colonel Mehdi Khan s force. Those of the Infantry (3 coys.) who were not killed or wounded surrendered. The Cavalry and Artillery, however, elfected their escape. The Turkomans involved m this rebellion belonged to the Yamut, Atabai Jatarbai, Khojak, Goklan and Kainyahmes tribes. Follow- mg J ioa r e , rei pf° rcem ents consisting of 230 Infantry and 1^0 Cavalry with two guns, under Colonel Haii Baqir Khan, were sent from Meshed and Mehdi Khan was relieved ot his command. On arrival in Meshed he was placed under arrest. On investigation it was discovered that he had extorted money from the Turkoman chiefs to the extent of over 250,000 Tomans in addition to horses, carpets and skins which were all confiscated by the Divisional Com mander. He was, however, released In August 1925 and his rank restored to him. In June, the Bujnurd Sardar put forward a counter claim against the Central Government for the upkeep of his troops for safeguarding the Northern frontier, which exceeded that of the Government’s claim for arrears of taxes. At this time a gang of about 300 Turkomans was constantly raiding the Meshed-Tehran road near Abbasabad with impunity. This state of affairs continued till in September they cut the telegraph line and were a menace to the whole countryside. Eventually 800 Cavalry were despatched from Tehran to deal with these raiders but they achieved no decisive result. The Prime Minister now realized his failure to deal with the Turkoman situation, and decided to open neoo- tiations with the Sardar who was in Tehran and wired 'to * the General Officer Commanding the Eastern Division to effect a settlement with the Turkomans themselves.12 The principle terms of the agreement arrived at between Eeza Khan and the Sardar were :— (a) The Sardar to be reinstated as Governor of Bujnurd. (b) The Sardar to continue to make his own arrange ments for guarding the frontier. (c) The expenses claimed by the Sardar for preserva tion of law and order to be deducted from the sum claimed by the Revenue Department. (d) The Sardar to send 5 Turkoman chiefs to Tehran as hostages for the conduct of the Turkomans. (e) All loot, arms, etc., captured by Turkomans to be restored. The Sardar arrived at Meshed from Tehran on the 14th November and left for Bujnurd on the 20th. The Turkomans whose numbers had now increased to some 2 , 000 , however, still continued their raids on the Meshed-Tehran and Kuchan-Askhabad roads and in the Jajarm and Samalqan districts. The most serious of these raids took place on 16th November in the Milanlu District, 36 miles north-west of Kuchan, where 60 villages were looted, 124 people killed, 18 women and children carried off as well as many camels and sheep. The detachment in Samalqan came into contact with these Turkomans, but as they were in grave danger of being cut off retired to their post at Samalqan without having fired a shot. On the 29th December, Colonel Haji Baqir Khan com manding the garrison of Bujnurd proceeded to Shirvan with reinforcements. 1925 .—During his absence, 200 men of his Regiment mutinied and telegraphed to Divisional Headquarters com plaining that they had not received their pay for 4 months. The Colonel on his return ordered 20 ringleaders to be flogged. Thereupon all the men mutinied and the Colonel in a frantic endeavour to restore the situation then turned a machine gun on them killing 22 and wounding 1.3. He was consequently recalled to Meshed together with the garrison of Bujnurd consisting of 700 men of all arms, who arrived on 11 th January. As a result of this mutiny afid his failure in dealing with the Turkomans', Husain Aqa Khazai, the General Officer Commanding, was recalled to Tehran on the 18th January.13 He was unpopular among his immediate subordinate officets and it was said that he had amassed about_ 500,000 Tomans during his term of service in this Division. A strong minded and capable General was badly needed^ for the Eastern Division and Sartip Jan Muhammad who had been commanding a Brigade ih Tehrati was transferred to n this vacancy. He commenced his work of reorganisation with vigour and took strong measures to restore discipline. He ordered all Regimental Officers to live in camp outside the town, imprisoned 12 junior officers for various offences ahd discharged about 278 men as unfit fot military service. He then turned his attention to the Turkoman situation and had the Sardar of Bujnurd and 30 others arrested and brought to Meshed where they were imprisoned. He proclaimed Martial Law in the Kuchan, ^ Bajgiranii Darreh Jaz, Kalat, Salakhs, Bam, Safiabad, Bujnurd and Turkish areas and Colonel Baqir Agha who was Commanding the Cavalry Regiment in Meshed, was appointed Military Governor of Bujpurd whither he proceeded with 100 In- fantryj 250 Cavalry and 3 Machine Guns. The Turkoman rebels, however, occupied Samalqan, Jajarm and Kifan, the garrisons of which were withdrawn to Bujnurd. In June, reinforcements arrived from Tehran, Shirvan and Sarakhs and the total strength of the Government forces in the Bujnurd area was estimated at that time to be 5,500. Two Junker aeroplanes were also used against the rebels. Zadranlu village was occupied on 16th July and 48 prisoners were captured and executed. Overtures of peace were then made by some sections of Turkomans who handed over about 900 rifles. The Sardar of Bujnurd with his two brothers and 4 leading followers were hanged m Meshed on 22 nd July. Up to the 1st August over 2,000 rifles were recovered. The Turkomans however did not fully accept the terms imposed upon them by the Persian Government and opera tions were renewed against them. Headquarters were established at Incha and the troops were organised m font columns::—^ (1) A force from Asterabad. (2) Two Regiments from South of Gunbad-i-Qabus, (3) , A force operating from Samalqan. (4) A force operating from Incha.14 Gumesh Teppe and Gunbad-i-Qabus, the headquarters of the rebels, were occupied on the 5th November, thus dis posing of the Goklans. Osman Akhund the Yamut leader and chief rebel fled to Russia. Marava Teppe was occu pied and thus the operations against the Turkomans were brought to a successful conclusion. The Yamuts—15,000 men, women and children—took refuge in Soviet territory, . where they remained till February 1926. Telegraph lines were constructed between Bandar-i-Gaz and Gumesh Teppe, and between Asterabad and Gunbad-i-Qabus early in 1926. The Soviet authorities were reliably reported both by the Persian authorities and by travellers to have instigated this Turkoman rebellion and to have helped the rebels with arms and ammunition. Hashmat-ud-Daulah, the Governor-General, was recalled to Tehran in June and a Military Governor-General Sarhang Murtaza Khan was appointed to act in his place. In October 1925, Reza Khan, the Prime Minister, suc ceeded through intensive propaganda, in winning over the majority of the Mejlis (National Assembly) in favour of the abolition of the Qajar dynasty and the formation of a Pro visional Government with himself at its head. The Pro visional Government was recognized by all the Foreign Powers and the news of the abdication of the Qajars was received in Khurasan without any signs ©f regret. The Meshed garrison received 1 month’s pay as a bonus. The reorganisation of the army w T as taken in hand in December and the Amnieh (Road Guards) force which had been brought under the Minister of War in 1922 was transferred once more to the Ministry of the Interior. On the 12th December, the Mejlis unanimously decided to offer the throne to Reza Shah, and his male descendants. The new dynasty was tq be known as the Pahlevi dynasty. The conscription law which had been passed by the Majliss in 1925 was enforced in earnest in February 1926. In March, Colonel Murad Ali Khan was sent from Tehran to superintend the ehforcement of conscription in Khurasan. He started his work from Sarakhs where 100 men were enlisted. About 1,050 men w T ere taken from Sabzawar and Nishapur. The agitation against conscription in Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz had no counterpart in Khurasan.15 In May 1927, the pay of conscripts was raised from Krans 7 per mensem to Krans 31 per mensem. The morale of the troops after the operations against the Turkomans was very bad. A number of desertions took place and the pay of the troops remained many months in arrears. This resulted in the oppression of the local popu lace. by the troops. On the 29th June, a mutiny broke out in the garrison at Marava Teppe, one of the Persian frontier posts on the Atrek river east of Chat. This mutiny was raised by Salar-i-Jang, a Non-Commissioned Officer of the garrison, who captured Incha, the garrison of which fled. Bujnurd and Shirvan were also occupied by him on the 2nd July, and the troops in the latter town went over to the mutineers. Five loyal junior officers w T ere shot dead while at their posts. Kuchan was occupied on the 10th. Reinforcements arrived from Tehran, and Kuchan was reoccupied on the 13th. Salar-i-Jang fled to Russia with 200 followers who were all disarmed by the Soviet authorities. There is no doubt that S art ip Jan Muhammad, tho General Officer Commanding who had purloined the money due to the men for pay, was entirely responsible for this munity. In July, a deputation of Khurasan merchants went to Tehran to complain to the Shah of his extortions. The result was that the Shah himself decided to visit Khorasan. He left Tehran on the 26th July accompanied by Sartip Amanullah Mirza, Taimurtash, Minister of Court and Sardar-i-Assad, Bakhtiari, who was Governor General of Khurasan in 1923. The General Officer Commanding met the Shah at Shahrud where he -was arrested and brought to Meshed on the 1st August, where he was publicly degraded by the Shah on parade. On the 2nd August Sartip Amanullah Mirza was appointed to command the Eastern Persian Division with Colonel Ahmed Khan as his Chief of Staff. Jan Muhammad wms sent to Tehran under escort for trial, as a result of which he was released but dismissed from the army. He was compelled to disgorge considerable sums of money -which he illegally acquired and deposited in the Imperial Bank of Persia. On the 3rd August, the Shah summoned about 100 officers of the Meshed garrison and delivered a short speech criticising the conduct of the arpry in Khurasan. He con-16 eluded by saying “ You have proved to foreigners that W© are unable to organize our military power He left for Bujnurd on the 8 th, where he court- martialled and shot 11 soldiers for complicity in the mutiny. He returned to Meshed on the 11th and ordered the in stitution of various reforms in the Shrine, such as reduc tion of pay of Shrine officials, etcw He left Meshed for Tehran on the 14th August. He then ordered the Headquarters of the Seistan and Kainat Brigade to be transferred from Birjand to Duzdap, where a Brigade was to be stationed. These orders were can celled in October and in their place orders were issued for a full strength Infantry Brigade to be stationed at Meshed and a mixed force composed of one regiment of cavalry one battalion Infantry and one battery artillery at Bujnurd. Colonel Iraj Khan was appointed to command the Meshed garrison. On the 27th September, the wireless station which had been in the process of construction since 1928 was officially opened. In August and September, the unrest, which had been brewing in Baluchistan since 1925, came^ to a head when the Rekis refused to allow troops to entrain at Mirjawa for Duzdap with a view to their concentration at Birjand, where they were to be inspected by the Shah. The orders for this inspection were however cancelled at the last minute as trouble was anticipated. Dost Muhammand of BampUr (nominally Persian Gov ernor of Duzdap) hearing of the evacuation of Khwash the garrison of which had left for the inspection at Birjand and having heard highly exaggerated stories of the mutinies in Khurasan and Azarbaijan, advanced towards Khwash with the intention of occupying it. Khwash however, had already been occupied by a party of Persian levies, under their tribal chiefs who were at that time due 6 months’ arrears of pay. Finding that the Persian troops were still at Duzdap that there was no indication of the dissolution of the Shah’s Government^, and hearing exaggerated stories of British aeroplanes at Taftan and of troops at Dalbandin, Dost Muhammad realised that his advance on Khwash had been ill-advised and declared that his sole object had been to. protect the Shah’s intrests. He ■ then returned toBampur and dispersed his men. A detachment o? 40 Persian regular camelry was detailed to garrison Khwash. It had been Amir-i-Lashkar Jan Muhammad Khan’s intention as soon as the Turkoman revolt had been sup pressed to form a colony of Berberis in part of the Turko man country, which would act as a sort of buffer state between Turkomans and Meshed. A certain proposals were made whereby about 3,000 Berberies were to be given land free of revenue for 8 years. The Berberis themselves were prepared to migrate and their Chiefs inspected the land offered to them in November 1926. The project was submitted to Tehran in 1927 and was finally approved by the Shah in September 1928. At the end of the year, the Yamut and Goklan Turkoman rebels who had fled across the Russian border and the followers of Salar-i-Jang began to return to Persia and their rifles were returned by the Soviet authorities. The discipline and general turn out of the men of the Division greatly improved during the last quarter of the year under Amanullah Mirza. A Committee of officers was formed to enquire into the budget of the Eastern Army which was considerably reduced. At the same time the Division was reorganised in 4 mixed regiments of all arms (cf. Brigade grotips) at Meshed, Bujnurd, Birjand and Duzdap respectively. In April 1927, the wireless station at Meshed which had not been working satisfactorily since its installation was handed over by the Military authorities to the Telegraph Department. In the same month the escort of His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate-General was abolished and left for India. It was replaced by Guards supplied by the Persian Army. 1928-29 .—The most noteworthy events in the Military history of Khurasan during this period were: — (i) The entry into Persian territory of Junaid Khan and his followers, the attempts made by the Persian Government to disarm him and his subsequent march through Persia into Afghanistan. ■ (ii) The' subjugation of Persian Baluchistan. Junaid Khan, the, Turkoman, outlaw in Soviet Turkistan, who had been waging guerilla warfare with the Soviet since 1920 was finally defeated in the spring of 1928, and in the18 following July with about 300 followers sought refuge in 1 ersian territory crossing the frontier in the vicinity of Chat, thence following the line of the Atrek river he settled in the area of Gunbad-i-Qabus. Thereupon the Soviet representatives in Tehran and Meshed requested the Persian Government to disarm and arrest Junaid Khan and his followers. The Persian authorities tried at first to achieve this by conciliatory measures but soon realised that the Turkomans would not surrender their arms except under compulsion. The Asterabad Brigade supported by a small column from Bujnurd was then ordered to operate against Junaid and to bring about his surrender. These operations however, which continued throughout the summer and autumn of 1928 proved abortive and the Persian troops suffered many casualties. A final effort to surround him was made in January 1929. On the 14th January, the Persian troops in two Columns, one 900 strong from Asterabad and the other 400 strong from Bujnurd, endeavoured to drive the 1 urkomans northwards and to hem them in on the Soviet frontier near Chat. Junaid Khan is reported to have lost about 30 killed in this engagement. He succeeded nevertheless in extricating his forces and retired towards Marava Teppe, where, it is believed, about 200 of. his fol lowers crossed the frontier and re-entered Soviet territory. He himself with 120 horsemen and about 30 women and children broke through southwards and fled towards the Afghan frontier. Troops were' Sent from Meshed to inter cept Junaid s party, but owing to shortage of cavalry and the bad condition of the roads they failed to do so. junaid Khan followed the route Jajarm-Jaghatai, thence taking a Une north of Sabzawar and striking south, he crossed the Tehran-Meshed road on the 25th January near Shurab (between Sabzawar and Nishapur). Here he was opposed by a small body of Persian troops which suffered a few casual ties and fled. He then went on in a south westerly direc- tion. On the 28th January, he crossed the Meshed-Duzdap road at Robat-i-Safid and on the 2 nd February was in the area of Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam where another 'attempt was made by the Persians to intercept him failed. Finally on the 4th February, he and his 120 odd followers with women and children succeeded in crossing into Afghan territory where they halted and were partially disarmed. They were then allowed to settle in the area of Ghurian, west of Herat. Junaid Khan’s march across Khurasan in mid winter hampered by some thirty women and children must be regarded as a very remarkable achievement.19 of ... Campaign in Persian Baluchistan—Owing to Dost he Muhammad Khan of Bampur’s refusal to recognise the he authority of the Shah and the Central Government and to ;ed remit revenue to Tehran, the Persian Government decided an to send a , n expeditionary force in Persian Baluchistan to rst occupy the province. The Persian Government were, e( l however, anxious to ensure that the Government of India p t S°i i . remam neutral and prevent the tribes of British a Baluchistan assisting Dost Muhammad. The Government | e ° j India assured the Persian Government that it would se ll P an attitude^ of benevolent neutrality and as in er earnest of this supplied the Persian troops of the Eastern ,, Province with a number of rifles which had asked for by the Persian Government. „ . Amanullah Mirza, the Commander of the Eastern Divi- sion, was given command of the forces against Dost Muhammad Khan. In October 1928, the Seistan Brigade about 800 strong was concentrated at Rahmatabad Rigan and a column of about 600 men at Kerman. One Cavalry Regiment, one Battalion of Infantry, a Mountain Battery and a section of Field Artillery from Meshed were concen trated at Duzdap. The total strength of the forces to oppose Dost Muhammad Khan was approximately 3,000 men, with 2 aeroplanes from Tehran. On the 28th October, the Seistan and Meshed forces advanced from the north (Khwash) while the Kerman force marched from the west. The Seistan Brigade left Khwash on the 28th October and captured Gasht on the following daj. The troops on the Mirjawa-K.hwB.sh line were main- tamed by motor transport. The Seistan force occupied Dizzak on the 7th November and Hushak on the 8 th. The Meshed troops, marching in the rear of the Seistan Brigade,^ occupied Magas on the 17th and Fahreh on the 20 th. Bampur was taken on the 23rd by the Kerman Column. This brought the operations^ to a close. The total Persian casualties in this campaign were one officer killed, two officers wounded, 8 other ranks killed and 25 wounded. Dost Muhammad fled to Sarbaz, whence he telegraphed to the Shah asking for pardon and permission to visit Tehran. This was granted and he was sent to Tehran under escort, where he was kept as a political detenu. On or about the 12th November 1929 he escaped and en- deavoured to get back to Persian Baluchistan. He was20 recaptured however on 29th December 1929, and brought to Tehran where he was court-martialled and shot on the 2nd February 1930. Seistan Historical retrospect .—During the first ten cen turies of the Christian era, and in still earlier times, Seistan was one of the most wealthy districts of South Central Asia, and there were times when it supported more than double its present population. From that time to the middle of the 19th century the once wealthy district had been im poverished, and large tracts had been laid waste by the devastating conquests of Mahmud of Ghazni, Jengiz Khan, Timur and Nadir Shah. In 1855, Ali Khan of Seistan, seceding from Herat, raised the Persian flag in Seistan, and Seistan first came to acknowledge subjection to Tehran. The Persian Government on securing Seistan determined to treat it as a conquered country. In 1894, the whole of the district was leased to the local Governor in return for a payment to the Persian Gov ernment of 200,000 maunds of grain and 26,000 krans in cash. The Governor was permitted to retain some 7,000 kharwars (about 1,400 tons) for payment of local officials and troops. It was left, to the Governor to, make such revenue arrangements as he liked, provided he paid the fixed revenue ’when due,, and did not. draw on the Persian Government for any local expenditure. The natural result was that the Governor proceeded to enrich himself without regard to the prosperity of the country. In 1902, the contract was taken from the local Governor, and a Director of Revenue was appointed. The replacement of the Governor by the Revenue Director resulted in no benefit to the agriculturists, and in 1908, the landowners and Madias rose against the prevail ing conditions. Tn Seistan, the years 1912-14 were uneventful. In July and August 1915, Indian troops were sent in from Nushki and these formed the nucleus of what was afterwards called the Seistan Field Force and subsequently, in 1918, became the East Persian Line of Communications. Levies were also raised locally by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Seistan, and these co-operated with our troops along the Line of Communications. The latter were disbanded in the. beginning of 1921, after the withdrawal of the main Meshed Force and the East Persian Line of Communica tions.CHAPTER II. GEOGRAPHIC AND CLIMATE, (A) Khurasan. Khurasan is the largest province of Persia. The total area is about 150,000 to 200,000 square miles. It is essen- tially mountainous, but fertile and fairly welLwatered in the north. Its northern boundary is the Russian frontier east of the Caspian. To the east it marches with Afghan^ istan and Seisian down to Kuh-i-Malik Siah; thence to Nasratahad Sipi, Deh Salm, Basiram/ Garmab, -Shaud Ali Reza, Naihand, between Chehil Pai and Darband to Pusht-i» Badam, thence northwards to near Abbasabad and follows roughly the 06 th 'degree of longitude to-the Atrek River, (1) Mountains. The mountain system of Khurasan which forms a link between the Elburz and the Paropamisus was in former days of great military value to Persia as it formed a con siderable obstacle . to the \ marauding hordes of nomads of Russian Turkistan. It is made up of several parallel fridges which flank the wide open valleys of Bujnurd, iRuchan and Meshed. sThe northern portion resolves )itself into two more or less parallel ranges, the most northerly of which, although by far the lower, is.of the more importance. This is the vertically scarped frontier barrier range which runs in an almost uribroken'line from Gifan in the west up to Sarakhs in the east. In most sections this range forms the actual frontier and its cliffs, though seldom more than 500 feet high, are unschleable and hence have saved Persia in the past from being overrun from Trans-Caspia by any thing more than small raiding parties of Turkomans. In the Gifan-Kaltachinar sector, this range, which is known as the Gulul Dagh, ia high and rough but traversed by a number of smugglers’ bridle tracks, in addition to the metalled motor road from Askhabad to Kuchan vid Bajgiran and a camel track (which is passable for wheels) from Geok Teppe via Rohat-di-Khairabad to Shirvan. West of Kaltachinar the frontier barrier range, in this sector known as the Kizil Dagh and Zarin iKuh, becomes22 lower but its cliffs are absolutely precipitous. In conse quence of the opening formed by the Duringan stream debouching into the Northern plain, the real rampart is further to the south along the crest line Ak-kamar, Kuh-i- Imarat, Allah-ho-Akbar, Hazar Masjid up to Kalat-i-Nadiri. It is penetrated only by bridle paths over rocky ascents, some of which the agile Kurdish camel has no great diffi culty in negotiating. The more important of these are : — Muhammadabad to Kuchan via the Allah-ho-Akbar. Kaakha to Meshed via Robat-i-Khakistar and Lain. Kaakha to Meshed via Kalat-i-Nadiri and Qardeh. The next sector is from Kalat-i-Nadiri to near Sarakhs, and is very characteristic. The crest line is not more than 3,500 feet above the plain but on the inner (or Persian) side the top which is 500 feet high is a perpendicular cliff, and the range itself runs in straight lines from point to point. The outer or Russian slopes are easy and in places negotiable by a mounted man, but the range is only pass able by defiles, or Darbands, formed by the gorges -where streams break through, at Darband-i-Nafta (a part of Kalat-i-Nadiri), Darband-i-Haji Bulan, Qaratigan, Cheh- eheh, and Chil Kaman ravine. The portion from Chil Kaman to Sarakhs is as yet unmapped. Here the range becomes lower, splits up and loses its distinctive character as it approaches the Han Rud. A rough track goes from Sarakhs to Mazdaran, which is in places just passable for wheels. The inner range of hills starts north-east of Bujnurd as a series of rolling downs including Khushkhaneh and the Julga-i-Takmiran, and rises to the massif of Potlagao (lat. 37° 40' N. long. 58° 4' E.). From here eastward it conti nues as the Allah-ho-Akbar and Hazar Masjid, described above. From the jumble of bilk: south of Kalat-i-Nadiri the Kara Dagh range runs to the sputh-east forming the northern wall of the Kashaf Rud valley. This .range is also rough and rocky but can be traversed by several passes which are negotiable by Kurdish camels in good weather. (a) t rom Haji Bulan via the Gau Kotal Khaur valley, and the Sanduq Shikan pass to Meshed. (b) From Haji Bulan via Chehcheh, Amirabad and the i Ghif Kotal to Meshed.(c) From Sarakhs via the Mazduran pass to Meshed. This road is practicable for field artillery. The Kalat-i-Nadiri is formed by a complete perimeter of vertical cliffs enclosing a fertile grassy valley some 16 miles long by four wide. Jn most places the vertical scrap is outside, and there are only a few places where active men might scramble up. A stream known as the Ab-i-Kalat enters by a gorge with precipitous sides a few yards wide at Darband-i-Arghawan and leaves by a similar gorge at Darband-i-Nafta. Both these are fortified by walls and towers and are passable for camels, which can enter also at the Khustani gate at the south-east corner of Kalat-i-Nadiri. Mules can scramble in by the Deh Chah and Giru tracks, and there are said to be two more ways which are passable on foot. The interior is a series of grassy meadows and about twelve 'villages dot its slopes. This natural fortress with its unsurmountable walls forms an outwork to the mountain ramparts of Khurasan. Kalat-i-Nadiri is the penal settle ment of Khurasan, to which convicts and other political piisoners aie sent to undergo their terms of imprisonment. The Kupeh Dagh, the ranges between Bujnurd and the Caspian are little known, but they contain fertile valleys which afford good pasturage. The cliffs of the frontier barrier are vertical on the southern side, though the approaches from that side are gradual and comparatively easy. On the other hand the northern slopes of the main ranges which lie to the south of the frontier barrier are precipitous. The ranges south of the valleys of Bujnurd, Kuchan and Meshed, Kuh-i-Nishapur, Kuh-i-Shah Jehan, and Aleh Dagh, form a more direct continuation of the Elburz than does the Kupeh Dagh, though they are of less military importance. Their northern slopes are gradual and their southern slopes precipitous. There are remote valleys in the folds of the hills among which are hidden away tiny villages set in fertile patches of cultivation surrounded by fruit trees and poplars. T he Kuh-i-Shah Jehan is said to be the highest peak in Khurasan, and exceeds 10,000 feet. It has not been surveyed. Apart from the Meshed-Turbat-i-Haidari motor24 j?oad, the only route fit for wheeled traffic that crosses this range is that from Kuchan to Sabzawar. East of the Sharifabad gap the range is continued to the Afghan frontier by a rUgged tumbled mass of hills, the eastern portion of which is known as the Firoz Kuh, which divides the Kakhaf Rud from the Jam valleys. The moun tains are barren, scorched and waterless and traversed only by a few bridle tracks. Jagdtai (Juviari) Mountains—Separate Sabzawar from Bam Safiabad, a little known tract. Kuh-i-Bahharz—This range divides the Jam from the Rui Khaf valley. The Kuh-i-Arqand is situated in the Zqrabad area, south-east of Meshed. The Meshed valley is separated from the plain of Turbat-i-Haidari by three rough, con fused, and arid ranges running roughly east and west. These are traversed by the motor road. Between Turbat-i-Haidari in the north and Persian Baluchistan in the south there are a series of minor ranges. Chief among these are the Kuh-i-Muminabad, Kuh-i- Baqaran, Kuh-i-Chehil Dukhtaran, Palangan Kuh, Kuh-i- Kalat, and Kuh-i-Cazik. A few brackish springs will be found here and there in the valleys. But for these springs Meshed would be unapproachable by caravans from the south. ( 2 ) Bivers. The Atrek is the most important river in Khurasan. From Chat-i-Atrek to Hasan Quli it forms the frontier. Above the Sisab gap at the western extremity of the BhirVan plain the river, except when in flood, is fordable in many places, though there are some fords below the gap which are occasionally used. The ford at Sisab is passable for Infantry and Cavalry but difficult for wheels. There is also a bridge which appears to be above any except high flood level. This is however kept in an indifferent state of repair. The ford is almost opposite the centre of the village. From Sisab to Mana the river runs in a narrow valley from i to 5 miles in breadth. It constitutes a considerable obstacle as it is from 4 to 6 feet deep when not in flood and has a strong current. It is easy to bridge almost anywhere as it frequently narrows, but bridges, except in a few places,musi inevitably be earned away by the sudden floods, called by storms and snow melting in spring. Below Duzlu Ulum 1 the Atrek becomes a. considerable river. The water is muddy and. brackish. Bagdumar /ords.—Opposite Lower Bagdumar village is a good ford which if the banks on both sides had ramps prepared would be suitable for wheels. (^mwhhark ford. —Indifferent. There is, however a good bridge which appears to be above high flood level. Agh Teppe (Ak Teppe) /ord.—Passable by mounted troops, Isfidan fords—T)ash-i-Olum /ord.—Reported to be good Infantry^ bed ' Passable foi? whee led traffic, Cavalry and Beshkala ford.—An exceptionally good ford with a firm ManTfnrd, 1 * ^ &amp; arm3 ' ThiS ford is also known as the . Betw een Beshkala in the Mana sub-division and the junction of the Chandir stream with the Atrek there are numerous fords which occur for the most part at intervals of about ten miles. From this point fords are less frequent, ihe following have been noted: — Tekinji. —About 5 miles Chandir and the Atrek. Yaghli-Olum. About 3 miles below Tekinji. Kizil. About 4 miles above Tekinji, No fords are passable when; the river is in flood, The Gurgan River is a similar river- to the Atrek in many respects, especially with regard to its high banks narrowness and muddy water. It rises on the plateau of Urmuth and flows west into the Caspian. Its volume how- ever, is considerably less than that of the Atrek below Mana and its depth varies from 5 to 8 feet. Fords. -There are many fords and they are usually to be found about six miles apart but information regarding them is scanty. 6 below the junction of the The Gurgan only becomes a considerable stream at the junction of the Dasht and Londar below Karatigan ap proximately about 5 miles above Gunbad-i-Qabus. ’ The water increases about 5, miles from here owing to its being fed by tributaries. *26 Aqiam ford is about 3 miles above Gunbad-i-Qabus. There is a bridge here which is reported to be in good repair. The ford is an easy one. Gunbad-i-Qabus ford .—Opposite Persian Customs Office. Reported good and easy. There are three bridges at Ak- kala, Aba-i-Anna, Khan Jafarbai, and Aba-i-Haji Muham mad Khan. The two latter are slight wooden structures built on piles, but there is no recent information regarding them. The water though not clear is fit for drinking. The Hari Bud Biver or Ab-i-Herat.—Forms the frontier between Persia and Afghanistan from Islam Kaleh (Kafir Kala) to Kushut Kala. From Islam Kaleh to Kaman-i- Bahisht the river flows between low banks through marshy country. The hills on the right bank are lower than those on the left and stretch down to the water’s edge. They are covered with tamarisk. The river is about 20 to 30 yards wide but on the melting of the snows swells to a width of 2—3 miles. Where the Jam river flows into it from the east is a reedy marsh, which is called Dehan-i-Du-Ab. There is an unimportant ford four miles above the junction which is commanded by Khaki Kala. From the Jam to the Istui the river is very tortuous and is flanked by mountains. There is no vegetation, and even single horseman cannot pass down its banks when the river is in flood. Below the Istui the Hari Rud valley again broadens out and is covered with tamarisk. Further to the north the Zulfikar hills come down to the river from the east and, forming a perpendicular wall, stretch as far down as the ruins of Haji Samitdni. From here down to Pul-i-Khatun the river winds from one side of the valley to the other. Hear the ruins of Garmab the valley opens out, contracting again near Pul-i-Khatun where it makes a sharp bend to the west. The normal current is 2f miles an hour (or 4/ per second), and in flood 4| miles an hour (or 7 1 a second). There are fords at Pul-i-Khatun, Haji Samitdni, Zulfi kar, Khaki Kala and Pish Robat. The last is only suitable ,for cavalry. At Pul-i-Khatun there is a bridge about 50 yards long .and 8 to ,9 feet high. It has three arches and is made ofgoocl stone. Two G. S. wagons can cross it abreast. The road leading from the bridge to Persia is suitable for horses and mules but not passable for M. T. and heavy artillery. There is no continuous road leading along the left bank ffrom Islam K&amp;la to Sarakhs, as offshoots of the Jam moun tains stretch down to the river edge between the points of junction ©f the rivers Jam and Ostin with the Hari Pud and also between Haji Samitdni and Pul-i-Khatun, and obstruct free communications, A road exists for the re mainder of the distance which 'would require a certain amount of labour between Islam Kala and the Jam river to make it fit for wheeled traffic. Other less important streams are: — Durigtm —rises N.-E. of Kuchan and flows Into the desert near Artik. Always fordable except in flood. 'Sumbar .— Chandir ,— } Little known, country. They drain the Goklan A b-i-Belnnjan .— A b-i-ltadlcan *— -Mere brooks. Rise in Kuh-i-Imarat. irrigate Radkan and flow into the Kashaf Rud. tShur Su .—A bitter stream. Always fordable except in flood. Amirabad .—Fresh water, rises from a hot spring and irrigates Ohehcheh. Ab-i-QaratigaM. —Fresh, always fordable. Ab-i-Verd, or Budbar .—A brook. Irrigates some of the Darreh Jaz villages. Abs-i-Kalat .—Tainted with mineral oil and scarcely drinkable. Flows through Kalat-i-Nadiri and irrigates its crops. Garma Khan .—Drains the plateau N. of Kuchan and finally joins the Buringan. A rivulet. 3 (3) Deserts. Dasht-i-Kavir.—This desert occupies the centre of Khura san. It commences east of Qum, and stretches east to the boundary of Turshiz, fully 400 miles. Its width varies from 80 to 150 miles. It is absolutely destitute of all sign of vegetation or of animal life. MII/T KBPOBT B28 Th® surface of the havir is honey-combed with small holes about 9 inches deep and the size of a man’s head which makes it very difficult walking for animals; but as the soil binds well a good road might possibly be made over it. Its mean altitude above the sea is only about 500—600 reet. ffihe danger of crossing it depends on the rainfall. Atter ram the surface becomes so slippery that camels cannot move on it. After heavy rain the whole kavir becomes a sticky quagmire, in which camels and even men Sm v? 11 ? Can ! lot 111 ove - The only chance for a caravan caught by a heavy ram storm when crossing is to stack the loads with a view to returning for them later, and make for the nearest port with all possible speed. The Jcavir by no means occupies the whole extent shown on the map as the Dasht-i-Kavir; it occupies a large irre gular area about the centre, with some outlying portions. Around the edges is sandy desert. r P° lnt of departure for caravans from the south is Jandak; the kavir to the north of this place is only 68 miles across; caravans cross here in winter with the utmost speed m constant fear of being caught by rain. In sum mer the terrific heat prevents any caravan traffic. f Tabas th ® re is a lar g e outlying expanse of kavir which accounts for that oasis being left some miles to the east by the mam route between Yezd and Meshed. The BasM-v-Lut occupies a considerable tract in the south-east of Khurasan. Its area may be described as a paraHelogram the angles being marked by the towns Neh, Tabas, Yazd and Kerman. The term hit is a general term for wastes m this part of the country, but differs from kmnr, as it may have sand interspersed over its sur face, whereas kavir never has; also the lut desert is gene- Ihrnh&lt;f pri k kl i? d n n the b ? rders at an .T rate, with thorny shrubs, which afford grazing for camels. In a tract called W ^b re f n ° 7 ater ’ but the soil is not altogether saline, l 068 not Prelude the formation of hauzes (pools). The interior of the desert is absolutely devoid of all signs of animal or vegetable life. Owing to the absence of fresh water, the great heat, and the existence of salt quagmires, these deserts can only be by + f ° 1 i 1 i OW - ng tbe , few recognised caravan routes, practically impassable for troops except in very smaU’bodies, they form an insurmountable obstacle for the move- ment of armies across them. The lut is, however, now; easily passable by M. T. which plies regularly between Meshed and Duzdap. The road is kept in good repair. In the autumn of 1928 troops were transported without difficulty from Meshed to Duzdap in lorries for operations in Baluchistan. (4) Towns (in alphab'etical order). Bujnurd .—Elevation 3,300 feet. Post and Telegraph office. Headquarters of the District of the same name, which is a fertile plain covered with gardens, trees, and cultivation, and surrounded by mountains. The town is quite open and has no fortifications. Its population num bers about 10,000, the majority of which are Shadillu Kurds, who speak Kurdish and are nearly all Shiahs with a few Bahais. Chinaran is a village of some importance as it is situ ated on the main road about half way between Meshed and Kuchan. The population is about 3,000 who are prin cipally Za’afaranlu Kurds. The village is walled, and has a small bazar. Outside and on the north side of the road there is a large sarai with 50 rooms and stabling for a large number of horses. Chinaran District, which is very fertile and well cultivated, could be drawn on for largo quantities of supplies. Gunbad-i-Qabus is a fine example of Russian colonial architecture in decay—a very straight street beginning and ending in nothing with a line of shabby houses with red tin roofs on either side. The. old Cossack quarters have fallen into disrepair, and the whole place is moribund in the extreme. Round the base of the Gunbad (dome) itself, the Persians have constructed what they imagine to be a defensive work. In 1929 it was garrisoned by Tabriz! troops, which shows that it was considered a place of great importance^ Gunabad (Jumin). Elevation 3,250 feet, Posts and Tele graph office, population 3,000. A large unwalled village in the Gunabad division of the Tabas District. Headquarters of a local Governor. Abundant water supply and fertile surroundings. A large cantonment was built during the war on our Line of Communications about a mile from tbs, s 2so village, tHe buildings of which were in a fair state of repair in 1930. Kuchan .—Elevation 4,280 feet, Post and Telegraph office, population (1929) estimated at about 15,000 com posed of Kurds, Turks, and Persians. The town, which is the Headquarters of the district of Kuchan, lies about 7§ miles east of the site of the old city which was repeatedly destroyed by earthquake and finally abandoned in 1895, The town is well built and regularly laid out with wide straight streets and has no fortifications. The Atrek river passes the north end of the town under a three-span stone bridge 180 feet long. The town is an important trade centre and is the junction of the roads from Bujnurd, Askhabad, Meshed, and Sabzawar. There are six water mills for grinding corn. The surrounding country is very productive and may be said to be the granary of Khurasan. Meshed .—The Capital of Khurasan, elevation 3,197 feet. Post and Telegraph office, population (1929) estimated 120,000. The city which measures about 2 miles from west to east, and 1 £ miles from north to south, is surrounded by a mud wall, with a circumference, roughly circular, of some fi miles. At the angles are bastions in the shape of round mud towers, and other smaller towers have been constructed at intervals along the walls. The wall which is now in the most dilapidated condi tion was originally 9 feet thick at the base and 4 feet at the top. There is a small ditch below the rampart, a low parapet on the crest of the counterscarp, and a wide deep ditch beyond. This ditch has been filled up in many places and only presences its original dimensions near the Arg Gate. A good motor road encircles the city on its northern, eastern, and western sides, while on the south side it cuts through the outskirts of the city. Great Britain, Soviet Russia, and Afghanistan have Consulates General in the Town. In 1923 a Turkish Consu late General was opened, but was abolished in 1924. During the year 1929 various schemes were put into force to improve the city, particularly its streets. It was decided to demolish many of the buildings and to Widen some of the narrow lanes. New wide avenues of the European pattern are being cut through the city, and when completed, the appearance of the city, and the com munications within it, will have been improved very consi derably.The political importance of the city is enhanced by the fact that it is one of the most important of the holy cities of the Shiah Muhammadans. Thousands of Shiah pilgrims visit this shrine every year from Central Asia, Afghanistan, India, and various parts of Persia, During the spring, summer, and early autumn there are usually about 10,000 of them in Meshed, but in the winter, when climatic conditions make transport diffi cult the town is practically deserted by pilgrims. Large numbers of students of Muhammadan theology undergo their preliminary training in Meshed before pro ceeding to join one of the numerous religious institutions in Iraq. Meshed has a considerable trade with Russia, India, Afghanistan, and Asia Minor, and acts as the distributing centre for the Province. Its chief industries are carpet making, shawl and silk weaving, and stone working. The carpet industry is growing very rapidly and Meshed has now become one of the chief centres of the carpet trade in Persia. To the north, east, south-east, and south of the town a belt of walled vineyards and fruit gardens extends out wards from a half to one mile from the walls. To the north-east there is a fertile plain which varies from 10 to 15 miles in width, which is dotted with many villages surrounded by cultivation. To the South-west the mountain wall approaches to rather less than two miles from the city, the intervening apace being sandy, little cultivated and much intersected by qanats (underground water channels). From the south to the south-east of the city lie low rocky hills at distances varying from 5 to 15 miles. In the surrounding districts most of the villages are protected by mud walls with circular projecting towers. Such walls are generally in a broken down and dilapidated state, and would provide but poor protection against rifle fire. Some villages to the north are protected by high raised mounds which are supposed to be the sites of Atish- kadehs (Fire Worshippers’ temples), many of which have strong cells or chambers which would serve as casemates. Such posts, improved, and combined with an outer line of defence would provide formidable obstacle to a force with only light guns.32 Nishqpur .—Elevation 4,000 feet, Post and Telegraph office, population about 15,000, is situated in the fertile district of the same name which has an area of some 2,000 square miles. The town is surrounded by a mud wall in which there are four gates. The surrounding country is very fertile, cotton being the chief product. Two cotton mills are working in the town, and most of the cotton is exported to Russia by the Soviet trading agencies. Bui Khnf .—Elevation 2,800 feet, Post and Telegraph office, headquarters of the Khaf district, with a population of about 13,000. Water plentiful from three qanuts (under ground water channels) and an annual grain produce of about 20,000 Indian maunds. Sal'zaimr .—Elevation 3,151 feet, Post and Telegraph office, population about 30,000. The town is surrounded by a wall with gates, and has a citadel all of which are in a broken down and delapidated condition. The trade is in wool, cottton, silk, dried fruits, and carpets. The latter is a new industry in this town and dates back only to 1926. Saralchs .—Post and Telegraph office, population 4,000 (1929) composed of Turks, Baluchis, Kurds, Persians, and a few Turkoman refugees from Russia. A squalid and unhealthy town encircled by an old wall (circumference about two miles) which is penetrated by only one gate which faces practically south. The town is situated in barren and low-lying country. The area is watered by the Tejend river. A great number of the houses have wells, but the water is very brackish, and acts as a mild aperient on new comers. This is characteristic of almost the whole district, and is popularly supposed to be the cause of an unsightly sore, like the Baghdad boil, which is called the Zakhum-i-Sarakhs. Opposite the town gate there is a mill which is worked by an oil engine, and is capable, when good kerosine is obtain able, of crushing 150 Meshedi maunds of flour an hour. What trade there is, is chiefly carried on by smuggling goods across the border. The majority of these smugglers are Turkomans who have escaped from the Merv district since the advent of the Soviet regime and settled in Persian Sarakhs,33 Shirvan.--Tost and Telegraph office. The town is un healthy owing to the bad water supply. There is no good, drinking water within two and a half miles. The soil is; very fertile. The Atrek river crosses the Kuchan-Shirvan road about a mile from the town. There is a good camping ground about a mile East of the town on the banks of the Atrek river. Tabas .—Elevation 2,370 feet, Post and Telegraph office,' population 6—8,000. The town has a strong brick wall, loop-holed and strengthened by circular towers at intervals.. A broad, deep, and dry ditch surrounds it. There are two gateways on both the West and East sides, each of which is , flanked on both sides by circular towers. The citadel is built on an immense mound, about 30 feet high, and is ; situated in the centre of the South face of the old town. It is about 80 yards square, and has towers at the corner and in the centre of each face. It is surrounded by a ditch, and the gateway, to which access is obtained by a bridge is in the North face. 1 The surrounding country is bare and unproductive ex cept where irrigated, and the grain grown is unsufficient for the requirements of the town. Tun (Firdausi).—Elevation 3,900 feet. Population about 4,000. Headquarters of the Governor of the District. , An important village in a fertile portion of the Tabas district. Turbat-i-Uaidari (Turbat-i-lsa Khan).—Elevation 4,000 feet, Post and Telegraph office, population about 18,000. It is the headquarters of the district of the same name, and is the seat of the Governor under whom there are seven Deputies. The town is situated at the junction of the roads from Meshed, Herat via Shahr-i-Nau, Herat and Birjand via, Rui Khaf, Jumin and Kain, Turshiz, Nisha- pur, and Sabzawar. It is surrounded by a broken down and dilapidated mud wall, on the Eastern side of which there is a small mud fort, which is of little defensive value. The town has a fine roofed-in bazaar, and there used to be a considerable trade in wool, cotton, silk, hides, opium, fruit, carpets, and grain. Copper and iron utensils are manufactured. Most of the wool dealt with comes from Herat and to some extent from the Bakharz, and Turbat-i- Shaikh Jam. This used formerly to be exported to Russia. FW the last few years trade has been almost negligible. ;34 On the North and South sides of the town the gardens and suburbs stretch out for several miles. There are about five good qanats (underground water channels) near the town. The town is commanded by the hills on the West, from which it is separated by a river bed which is usually dry, but which comes down in spate after heavy rain. The surrounding country is very fertile with a large number of qanats and has plentiful supplies of grain, live stock and fruit. In 1919 an extensive cantonment with many stone build ings was constructed outside the city on our Line of Com munications. Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam .—A large village of some 3,000 in habitants, which is the headquarters of the Jam district. Annual grain supply upwards of 20,000 Indian maunds. Turshiz (Sultanabad).—Elevation 2,209 feet. A walled town of about 12,000 inhabitants in the fertile district of the same name. Water is plentiful and supplies estimated sufficient for a Division. The chief industry is the manufacture of carpets. Trade with Soviet Russia in dried fruit is now (1930) completely at a standstill, which has resulted in considerable poverty among the population, who in former years derived a large proportion of their incomes from this export trade. (5) Climate. Khurasan has within itself every variety of climate and ranges from a temperature of 10 ° Fahrenheit in the winter to 110° in the summer. In the higher altitudes the cold is intense. Notwithstanding this the climate is generally salubrious. Meshed has an excellent climate, which has an average summer temperature of 92°. Nevertheless the town is con sidered unhealthy owing to the fact that it is, in effect, one large graveyard. The rainfall averages 782 inches, excluding snow, of which the average annual fall is about 18 inches. The rainy months are March, April, November and December, the spring fall being the heavier.( 6 ) Health. Fevers are prevalent. Mosquitoes flourish up to a height of 4,000 feet, and their chief haunts are in the stagnant P - i S ‘ Malaria is therefore prevalent and nets are essen tial. Sand flies are also very troublesome; they may, how ever, be avoided by sleeping away from any damp walls. Water should afways be looked on with suspicion, as it comes tiom various sources and should invariably be either treated with chemicals or boiled. Dust is very prevalent during the summer and autumn and some sort of protection, which umuld also serve the purpose of glare glasses should be worn. This is also essen tial during the winter owing to snow. A tropical disease known as “ Salik ” is very common and m appearance and characteristics very like the Delhi i ' Ch ° lera occasionally visits Khurasan. In 1908 : , ,938 Pei’sons died of plague. A malignant bloodsucking bug, causing blood poisoning and tick fever is found at several places, notably at Gifan and on the Meshed-Turbat- i-Daidan road. &gt; Peisian dwellings and sarais should be avoided and never occupied without being thoroughly disinfected. Anthrax is very common in man and beast. Venereal diseases are rife. (B) Seistan. • ^ S ^ r ’ c ^. 1 k nown as Seistan, which sometimes was independent alike of Persia and Afghanistan, included all the region drained by the Helmand and other rivers which discharge their waters into the Hamun. Of this area 2 847 square miles only are now Persian, the remainder Afghan, the name Seistan, however, now has reference only to the foimer, the Afghan portion being known as Chakansur. due accepted boundary line between Persian Seistan and lono istan, as laid down by the Arbitration Commission. n ^ rom Kuh-i-Malik Siah in a straight line to the Band-i-Seistan, and thence along the bed of the Helmand ■o the point of separation of its two branches, the R.ud-i- Parian and the Nad-i-Ali channel. From there it follows the bed of the Nad-i-Ali channel into the Sikhsar and along the bed of the Sikhsar to a point near Deh Jar Muham36 mad where the river is diverted westwards in a water channel. It follows the left bank of this channel to the Shila-i-Sihamshiri; thence in a straight line to Tappeh-i- Tilai, and on to the most western of the mounds of Tappeh- i-Shahraki, the most western mound of Tappeh-i-Kurki, Shalgami and finally Siah Kuh, Bandan. The above defines the boundaries to the north, east and south. The western boundary runs from Siah Kuh (more generally known as Kar Ahu Kuh) through Hauz-i-Nadiri (a water reservoir midway between Bandan and Baring, to Sum-i-Siah (cor rected name of Sang-i-Siah); thence along the west edge of the Hamun through Gumbaz-i-Khadija, and thence straight to Hurmak and Kuh-i-Malik Siah Ziarat. The whole area thus approximates in shape to a triangle and is mostly desert and uninhabited. The Helmand, Farah Rud, Harut Rud and Khash Rud converge and pour their waters into Seistan, creating, in time of flood, the great lake filling the Hamun area. Owing to constant changes of the course of the Helmand, the delta is made up of three distinct component deltas, each of which has, at one time or another, received the water of the river. The first comprises the southern por tion of Seistan, which, having been deserted for centuries by the river, has become a desolate uninhabited country instead of a rich populous one. The second delta is entirely in Afghanistan and owing to the deflection of the river has similarly become an uninhabited, waterless desert. The third delta comprises all the inhabited region of Seistan and Chakansur and is watered by the Helmand and its three distributary channels; interspersed between these three deltas are gravel covered plains which probably have never been irrigated. The southern portion of Seistan is a waterless tract, destitute of all vegetation. In the west, mountains stretch from Saindak in the south to Bandan in the north. To the north the plain ends abruptly in a line of cliffs (30 to 150 feet high), which, beginning on the Helmand opposite Kuhak, fringe the south of inhabited Seistan to near Hauzdar. The Kuh-i-Khwaja, an isolated table-togped hill of black volcanic rock, is the only natural feature of any importance in this area. f In the interior and more populous tract of the Rud-i- Seistan, not a tree is to be seen; but along the banks of the Helxnand tamarisk trees abound. Eyerywhere ig thesedeltaic plains is a rich covering of low scrub and reeds, which' give the country a green appearance. Approaching the Helmand at flood time, nothing but a vast expanse of water is to be seen to the west; at other times the reed beds (naizar) have grown so high and thick, that little or no open water is visible from the shores of the main land. (1) Mountains. The Palangan Kuh hills situated in the Qainat form the western boundary of Seistan, and consist of innumer able parallel ranges, varying from 4,000' to 8,000' in alti tude. The name Palangan Kuh is commonly applied to the whole range visible from Seistan. Properly, however, it only belongs to one very prominent rock table. This great slab, sixty miles in length by a few hundred yards in breadth, Is tilted gently to the west and is scarped on all sides by tremendous walls of rock and there only exist two or three difficult tracks by which access to it can be gained. The ranges are separated by narrow valleys, and sometimes by broad saucer-shaped plateaux liable to inundation during the rainy, season. These valleys and plateaux contain numerous springs and wells. The only other hill of importance is the Kuh-i-Khwaja, with an altitude of 2,037 feet and commanding the ap proaches from Birjand and Neh. There is no water on this hill, but half a mile to the west the ground is usually a swamp. (2) The Eamun. Seistan is a deep basin into which the drainage of a large tract of country runs. This drainage finds its way into the Hamun, which becomes in flood season a large lake, more than 100 miles in length, and varying from 5 to 10 miles in breadth. This is nowhere very deep, only about 15 feet in the deeper depressions, and not more than 4 to 8 feet over the remaining area in flood time. The water begins to rise about April and to subside about August; by winter large tracts of it have dried up. The shallow por tions and edges are closely set with reeds. This area ia known as the Naizar, and it is across it that tutins (rafts made of bulrushes) run in time of flood, and the various tracts lead when the water has subsided. The Hamun or Hamuns have been compared to a series of saucers, each touching but slightly raised above the one38 next to it. the one saucer overflowing into the next belotf and so on. The road across the Hamun from Lab-i-Baring to Afzalabad lies along what may be described as the lip of two adjoining saucers. Even when the Hamun is in flood, camels can get across this route, generally led across un laden, their loads being ferried across on tutins (rafts mad© of bulrushes). During the dry season (October-June) the Hamun can be traversed by car between Seistan and Safi- dawa, and Seistan and Shusp via Bandan. On occasions the Hamun overflows, the water being dis charged into the Gaud-i-Zireh in Afghan territory. In summer the Hamun area is practically impassable and in winter it still offers considerable obstacles to the passage of troops. (3) Rivers. The Helm,and is an Afghan river, which, after arriving in Seistan divides into three branches. The first, called the Rud-i-Seistan, is really a big canal which takes off at the Band-i-Seistan. On it Persian Seistan depemds largely for its irrigation. The main channel of the Helmand is now the Rud-i-Parian. Towards the end of March the river is usually well in flood and impassable to mounted troops. Maximum flood is towards the middle or end of April, or at latest, early in May, after which the river slowly subsides. The best fords are always at the bars or shallows of the river. In dry years the fords are not closed long. Rafts, called sal, are used on the Helmand &gt; these are formed of a framework of sticks placed across gourds or inflated goat ■skins. A raft measuring some S' by 6 1 is said to be able to (Tarry three camel loads. Camels are swum over with the help of two inflated skins. The only other river of Seistan is the Sar-i-Shilag, or Shila, a wide deep gully, formed by the overflow of the Hamun, and draining the Palangan Kuh. The amount of water contained in the river bed depends entirely on the overflow of the Hamun, for the ravines which run down from the Palangan Kuh add but little water to its volume. The fords are few and may become impassable when inun dations are deep. The river banks are vertical and in places 35 feet high. The bottom at the sides is of soft mud. The water in the centre of the stream is very salt.; Sweet water can usually ]?e got by digging the sand of the i&gt;ed.^4) Towns and Villages (in alphabetical order). Aliahad a well built village of 250 houses with good ■water supply and many gardens. Population about 1,500* Birj and .—Elevation 4,600/ on the northern slopes of ai barren stonv valley, has a population of about 8 10,000 souls. The inhabitants are mostly descended from Shadillu Kurds, but there is a strong leavening, especially in com mercial pursuits, of Persians and Turks. The town was originally walled, as is the case with most towns in the north, but very little trace of the old walls now remains. The eastern gate still, however, remains fairly intact and gives some idea of the original line. The town is approxi mately &gt;3 miles in circumference and contains a large number, of gardens. Birjand has a big bazaar consisting of 700 shops with a large number of leather workers. Good water is abundant. To the west of the town, at the end of a spur, is situated a fort, which is a more important w r ork. It is a square of about 100 yards with walls 40 feet high, built on the river bank which is scarped to the north; the approaches from all directions are difficult and steep. It is at present in a ruinous and useless state, hut if put into good repair, might be held against Infantry. Cover exists close up to it and it is commanded by a hill about 1,500 yards to the east. Birjand is self-supporting in cereals, but tea and sugar have to be imported. An extensive cantonment was built under the hills about three miles from the town, for the Headquarters of our Line of Com munications, and up to May 1921 was still in an excellent state of repair. The summer residence of His Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain is situated close to this can tonment. The British Vice-Consulate is in the town of Birjand itself. Bunjar .—The largest village outside Seistan proper. Population 6,000, houses 5,000. There are many good gardens. Daulatabad .—Population 2,000 with 400 houses. An important supply centre. Hurmuk 37 miles from Duzdap.—Large Cantonment only (built in 1919), but water plentiful and good. The buildings here have been looted of anything moveable. Khunik—Small village. No supplies available in 1910. 3 k serai was built here for troops marching through,, but40 has now fallen into a state of disrepair. The road to Xeh (4 miles) branches off from here. Khwaja Ahmed .—Small village but noted as residence of ftbe head of the Nauri and Baluch tribes.. Nasratabad, the capital af Seisfan.—Population about 12,000. Commonly called Shahr-i-Seistan or simply Seistan. The Persian Postal Department call the town “ Nasirabad Seistan It contains two old quarters, named respectively Nasirabad and Husainabad. The fortifications of the town are now negligible, being breached in many places. In the Husainabad quarter are the British and Russian Consu lates, Customs, Revenue, Postal, Telegraph and Police offices; also the greater part of the bazar, which includes a few good shops belonging to British Indian traders and a number of caravan-serais. Neh .—Elevation 4,023 feet, is situated on an elevated, barren stony plain surrounded by hills and is well supplied with provisions. It lies in a hollow in the middle of the plains and consists of a ruined mud fort on a mound, with a citadel held by a few men. Its importance is due to the fact that it is an advanced post on the main route to Birjand from Seistan, and a track (a very bad one owing to lack of water) leads from here to Kerman across the Lut. There are 8 qanats (underground water channels) and a little cultivation. Qain .—Elevation 4,600 feet. Population 4,000 of whom 1,000 are Saiyids and the remainder Razgars or Persian cultivators. The town is surrounded by a ruined mud wwll. About one mile to the south of the town are several gardens which are hot weather resorts of most of the owners. The town of Qain is commanded to the S.E, by hills. About 2 miles to the south on a steep hill is a strong stone forti fication, a relic of former greatness. The surrounding country is mountainous with a number of plateaux and fertile, valleys 4,000 to 7,000 feet above the sea. A cantonment was constructed near the town on our Line of Communications. Safidawa. —Cantonment only (built in 1919). No vil lage, Water was supplied during occupation by pipe line from the hills, distant about 3 miles; but is now cut off.

A note on the Strategic position of Seistan* 1 . The geographical position and productiveness of Seis-i tan make it an important strategic area, a fact fully re- cognised by Russia, who might, owing to its present defenceless condition, attempt to seize it at, or even before, the outset of hostilities with Britain. A rapid movement from Zulfikar, via Kariz, by a small mobile force would not be difficult and once established in Seistan it would be difficult to dislodge. It is therefore of primary importance to prevent a small force suddenly seizing Seistan. Owing to the country being so favourably adapted for defence against invasion from the north, especially in the summer, a small defending force, with knowledge of the ground, should be able to do this. There are three lines of approach: — (1) To cross the Hamun. (2) To skirt it by the north. (3) To skirt it by the south. In normal years, from April to November, a vast eX 4 pause of water of marsh stretches from Kalah-i-Kang on the north-west, past Chakansur, and extends along the northern and western extremities as far south as the overflow of the Hamun into the Shila river. At times ox floods even unladen animals can only be taken acioss this with great difficulty by a few recognised routes. Were a hostile force to succeed in crossing this, the countiy in their rear regains a network of canals and watercuts only kept from over-flowing by protective embankments, ihe cutting of these would turn any position the enemy had taken up into an island or a morass. In summer the depth of the stretch of water at the crossing of the Hamun, is 2 to 4 feet, and much deeper in other places. The bed is full of holes and mts and tin,, bottom is of a sticky nature. The width of water varies from 12 to 15 miles in a straight line, but the actual dis tance traversed in crossing, except m the very southe portion, is 15 to 20 miles. Good guides are required, though through the reed beds regular recognised routes are cut. It th ere fore constitutes a serious obstacle to troops, evenleft bank of the Helmand is the commanding bank and greatly favours defence. S a 3. Appears the most probable course.

This river during part of norm al summers is unfordable, and its high precipitous .banks make it a formidable barrier in face of opposition. Having crossed here, another 40 miles of un inhabited country still remain before Varmal or Seh-Kuha their objective is reached.

This can be miti- gated by bringing water from the Helmand. By marching Ji- n v.f ht r thlS waterless str etch can be traversed during the height of summer. Unless supplies were stocked at the various stages, the rapid movement of any force would be senousJy nujoeded. Supplies could be sent from Seistan p the Helmand valley. Fodder in normal years is very abundant in the valley itself. The people in the Helmand valley and Afghan Seistan are mostly Baluchis and Brahuis, and are friendly, except U °+i? r i P v 0bl ^ ltl0 ? fr ° m R- a k u i- They would cordially assist -people a ^° Ur Supplles - They ar e a quite inoffensive „„ F ?r water carrying arrangements, leather palchals are unreliable on account of the dryness which rots the leather.44 Very large-sized aluminium or other metal vessels are re* quired, and every member of the force should have a canvas chagal. On the Helmand and especially in Seistan, boats are invaluable. The Helmand is navigable, even in winter, by boats of draught not exceeding 2 feet. A military force should be liberally supplied with Berthan or .collapsable boats, and with light, strong pontoons of shallow draught for carrying heavy loads. Experienced boatmen should be brought. A large supply of ropes is most necessary for water work, 3' for bridging, and l' manilla for ferrying work. Very long ropes are necessary, owing to the width of the Helmand and its branches. Long bamboo poles are required for working rafts (of timber or reeds). Light portable bridging material would be useful for the narrow deep canals and water-cuts in Seistan. Light axes or hukris are most necessary for clearing jungle, cutting tamarisk for bridging, etc. Climate of Seistan. The climate of Seistan is one of great variety and sudden changes. There are practically only two seasons, for spring and autumn hardly exist. In some years the transition from winter to summer and vice versa is so rapid that it may be said to be a matter of a few hours. Summer sets in at any date between the end of March and the middle of April, and winter sets in with equal suddenness at any time in November. May and the first half of June are very hot and trying the tempera ture rising to 116°. Mosquitoes and other winged insects are a veritable scourge. The Winds of Seistan. From the end of May or the middle of June, the famous “ bad-i-sad-o-bist roz ”, (i.e., the wind of 120 days) sets in, which blows continuously till the middle- or end of Sep tember. This wind has its origin in a district on the Russian Bide of the Afghan frontier, which is called “ bad girz ” (the birth place of the wind). Starting from this point this wind blows across Herat and southwards to Lash45 Juwain, where it attains its maximum velocity and force, Thence it blows across Seistan, and, striking the Helmand, follows that river up to Band-i-Kamal Khan, where it wheels east and continues up the Helmand for 40 or 50 miles. It then turns due south to the western spurs of the Koh-i-Sultan range, crosses these mountains and blows south over the western Chagai desert, keeping east of Mashkhel. It continues on this line till it blows itself out, either in Mekran or at the sea coast. Its velocity decreases as it progresses south of the Koh-i-Sultan range. The breadth of this windstream is said to average 80 miles, in the centre of which the wind attains its greatest velocity. Although causing discomfort from dust, noise, etc., it saves Seistan by blowing away the insects, mitigating the heat and clearing the country of typhus, smalkpox and diseases rife in May and June. Without this wind the Seistan summer would be almost unbearable and very un healthy. When it ceases finally, which it does abruptly, the temperature again rises. During the winter, this zone is subject to blizzards, which occur at intervals of three to four weeks and con tinues from two to three days. These blizzards blow from the same point of the compass as the 120 days wind, but cover a breadth of 140—160 miles. The dead centre of both the wind stream and the blizzards is Nushki Chah, on the old Nushki-Seistan trade route. The violence of the winds in this area is reported to have reached, on occasions, 120 miles per hour. The rainfall is slight and in ordinary years averages inches. May to October may be regarded as practically rainless. Showers of light rain occasionally fall during the winter. The quantity is never excessive, hut, owing to the high level of the ground water and to the flat sur face of the clay soil, a fall of even half an inch is sufficient to interfere seriously with transport animals, especially camels. Health. Seistan is probably the healthiest place in East Persia, a fact which can be ascribed to the high wind mentioned above. Endemic diseases are typhus, small-pox, enteric fever and relapsing fever. Cases of small-pox and enteric fever are constantly met with, and it is therefore essentialthat all troops coming to Seistan should be vaccinated and inoculated against these diseases. The great danger in Seistan is however venereal disease -which is extremely prevalent. The number of infected women is very large and the strictest discipline would be required to prevent the spread of this disease among troops.47 Chapter ni. POPULATION. KhuRasan. The population of Khurasan is about 3,000,000. I 'Religion. (a) Muhammadan —(i) Sunnis and Shiahs.*—The majority of the population of Persia are Shiahs, though the Kurds and Turkomans, who form about oiie fifth of the population } are Sunnis. In Khurasan itself the only parts inhabited by Sunnis are the Bakharz and Bujnurd districts. Ih Bakharz, Sunni-Hazai'as Under their chief Saulat-us- Saltaneh, who is of pro-Russian tendencies, are to he found, while in the Bujnurd area the Turkomans and Kurds are Sunnis. The two factions—Sunnis and Shiahs* though harbour*- ing a certain amount of latent antipathy towards each other, unlike those of Afghanistan, live peacefully together and do not show signs of open enmity. (ii) The Babis (now known as the “ Bahais ”) are a sect of comparatively recent origin whose founder (known as the Bab) was Mirza Ali Muhammad, a young Saiyid of Shiraz* who was born about 1820. He began to preach at Bushire as a religious revivalist against the laxity and corruption of the orthodox Shiah clergy. His fame spread rapidly, and as he was considered a danger to the orthodox faith, Was arrested at Shiraz, in 1845 and remained in captivity during the greater part of his brief career (1844—1850). His disciples, however, carried on active propaganda throughout Persia which resulted in a series of revolts against the Government. These revolts were ruthlessly put down and the Bab was 'executed. In 1852 a last attempt against the Government was made by three Babis to assassinate Nasir-ud-Din Shah and this led to a fierce outbreak of persecution. In 1866 Mirza Husain Ali, entitled Baha Ullah, declared himself to be the Bab’s successor and was recognised as such by the majority of the Babis whose number had con siderably increased. He died in 1892. He was succeeded by his son Abdul Baha who died in 1921.The leader of the sect at present is one Shauqi Effendi who lives in Haifa in Palestine. Their numbers in Persia are estimated at about 5,000 and there are some 500—600 Bahais of both sexes in Khurasan. In September 1929 they were given full religious freedom. Several officers of the Meshed garrison are now (1930) Bahais. (iii) The Jadid-ul-Islam.—These are Jews who, to avoid persecution, have outwardly adopted the faith of Islam. They therefore call themselves the Jadid-ul-Islam, i.e., “ New converts to Islam ”. In actual practice, however, they observe the tenets of the Jewish faith very stiictly. Thus they keep Saturdays as holidays, and observe the 6th October as New Year’s day, burn lights in their houses on Friday nights and keep the Passover. In public, however, they masquerade as Muhammadans. As a community they are well off and compose about a quarter of the more important mercants of Khurasan. (b) The Z dr oast rio/ns .—These are the representatives of the original fire-worshipping religion of Persia. In India they are known as Parsis. There are very few Zoroastrians in Khurasan. (c) Christianity has made litle headway in Khurasan. In Meshed there are about a hundred so-called Christians who have been baptised by the American mission. It is ve.ry doubtful, however, if any of these have been converted jn the true meaning of the word. (3) TRIBES. • (a) Khueasan. The population of Khurasan is very mixed and Persians predominate only in the villages of the Meshed plain, and the districts of Nishapur and the Qainat. Turkomans of the Goklan and Yamut tribes inhabit the frontier districts of the North East. In Kuchan, Bujnurd and Darreh Jaz the predominant tribes are Kurds. The Northern frontier, especially the district of Kalat-i-Nadiri is inhabited by Turks, who are found scattered all over the northern part of the province. Their centre may be said to be the Jam valley where there are also many Taimuris and Baluchis. These latter wander far afield into Sarakhs and Soviet territory. Tribes of49 Arab origin are to be found in Turshiz, Gain, Tun (Firdausi) and Tabas. (1) Turkomans—Goklan—Habitat—-the pasture lands of the Sumbar and Chandli valleys. They are a nomadic tribe consisting of about 2,000 families. Their fighting men are well mounted but have little reputation for bravery. They are generally dirty and lazy, and live in constant strife with their neighbours and in fear of the Yamuts. It is estimated that they could turn out about 1,000 men armed with magazine rifles. They are divided into two main sections, the Karakul and Nakhuli, and in 1929 the habitat of some of the main subsections was as follows: — (i) Karakul. —Jargalan valley, 15 miles from Aq Darra. Chief—Jan Muhammad. About 200 families. 40 families in “ Bachha Darra ” and “ Ashk ,f mountains close to the Soviet frontier. Head man—Mullah Isa. 40 families in Amand under Shadi Khan and Isa Khan. 50 families in Agri Kaba, near the frontier of Soviet Russia, opposite the Red Army post of Chakan. Headman—Quli Khan. 70 families in Hissarcha and its area under Jan Muhammad himself. (ii) Nakhuli. —Northern and Eastern Jargalan valley. About 100 families. Sub-sections— Inhabit Gunbad Ali, 34 miles East of Hissarcha, at the farthest end of the Jargalan valley. The Yamuts.—Habitat: banks of the Gurgan and Atrek rivers and as far north as Balkan and Krasnovodsk. There are in all about 30,000 families, of which some 7,000 live in Khurasan. The characteristic peculiar to this tribe is their aver sion tc? co-operate among themselves. Thus although every sub-section may have its own chief, no central tribal authority is acknowledged, and consequently tribal fends Begi tribe. Mullah Mohd. tribe.* 51 (iii) (iv) Aq Turkomans in the area of Suqa.—About 70 families under Qurban Khan. ' aWit^fn +h rf1vlr ^°™ ans ' ^ f am ilies scattered Khan* ^ mountains under ^ Chief, Kuchik against thf rentr G l P d YamUt Turkoma as rebelled tfken a*ains C t tb^ G ^f rnment and Strong measures were !rn + VT th ’ folIowin g which several families emi- tan d t0 ° ther PaTtS ° f the countr y and to Soviet Turkis- to “to '' ere Pard ° ned 8nd alWd In 1928 the Goklan chiefs were Abdul Qadir Ishan and Muhammad Jan Ishan, whilst prominent among the Yamut chiefs was Aqa Muhammad. The authority of the Government in these parts is vested in the headmen of the different tribes and sections, who are responsible to the local Governor at Bujnurd for keeping the peace in the area under their control. Thev are also authorized to carry out the duties of the “ Amnia ” (road guards) on behalf of the Government. (2) Kurds—There are about 150,000 Kurds in Khurasan they were originally brought there by Shah Abbas to check Turkoman inroads. They are notorious for thieving and plundering. &amp; The most noteworthy tribal divisions are: — (a) Amarlu. Habitat, north-west of Nishapur, in the Marush plain. 500 families. They retain their own dialect and are Shiahs. (b) (STiodiKu.-—Habitat, Bujnurd and Kuchan. In Bujnurd districts they number some 75,000. Chief of these is the Sardar of Bujnurd, who holds the territory as a fief from the Shah. They live in villages. Of fine physique, they are bold riders and very enduring, and are accus tomed to constant warfare with the Turkomans. They supply to their Sardar a form of mounted militia of some 700 horse men, of whom 100 are very well mounted and armed with rifles. They possess some 7,000 rifles. Some 300 foot militia, badly armed, act as road guards.52 (c) Za'afaranlu. —Habitat, Kuchan and Shirvan, in which districts they number 50,000 and 12,000 respectively. A fine, robust, well-clothed and well-housed race. Have the reputation of being brave, hospitable, honest and of independent bearing. Of their total 49,000 are settled and 13,000 nomads. Not of much fighting value. Speak Kurdish, Turkish and Persian. Total number of rifles, 1,700 magazine and 3,300 single loaders. (d) Kaiwanlu, a Kurdish tribe expatriated by Shah Abbas together with the Za’afaranlu (Kuchan district) and Shahdillu (Bujnurd district) from Kurdistan about the year 1600. Scattered ele ments of this tribe are found in the Darrehjaz, Kuchan, Juwain, and other areas, but its head quarters may be said to be Radkan. Its Gov ernment was, until recently, in the hands of its Ilkhani. Formerly nomadic, like the other Kurdish tribes brought to Khurasan, it has now settled down to agriculture, and the nomads form but a small proportion of the whole. 8,000 souls with about 150 rifles (modern single loaders). (3) Chadar Amah. — i.e. “tent dwellers”. This term is loosely used and refers to nomadic tent dwellers. It is especially applied to the Hazaras, and tribes along the Persian-Herat border, viz., the Taimuris, and Baluchis. Taimuris.—A warlike race of Sunnis, who are on bad terms with the Berberis, though the ancient feud between them may now (1930) be said to be at an end. They are on none too good terms with the Persian Government. In appearance darker than, but somewhat similar to, the Arabs. The tribe, which is said to contain about 6,000 families, is scattered over the Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam, Bakharz, and Rui Khaf districts. A number of the tribe are tent-dwellers owning large flocks of goats and sheep. The remainder are cultivators. , The Mishmast section are Shiahs. The Seistan Levy Corps enlisted two troops of Mounted Infantry from this tribe. These were later transferred to the Khurasan Levy Corps, which corps was disbanded in January 1921. More could have been raised if they had53 been required. They are hardy, and with training make good soldiers. (4) Hazaras are Shiahs who emigrated from the Haza rajat in Afghanistan. In 1891 they were conquered by the Amir Abdur Rahman, were dispossessed of their lands and enslaved. Many migrated to Khurasan, and a few to Baluchistan in India. They are called Berberis by the Persians after the Band-i-Berber in Hazarajat, and also perhaps, from the fact that, being foreigners they “ berber ” in their talk. This name distinguishes them from the Sunni Hazara tribe which live partly in Herat and partly in Persian Khurasan but does not originate from Hazarajat. They are spread over a large area of Khurasan, as far as Bujnurd, Shirvan, Darreh Jaz, Sarakhs and the valleys of the Jam and Kashaf Rud. There is a colony of them in the Merv oasis in Soviet Turkmenistan. There hereditary chiefs are Saiyid Haidar and Saiyid Murtaza who live at Garma near Fariman and Kariz (Taibad) respectively. There are two main divisions of the tribe, the Dezangi and the Jaghur which are sub-divided into many minor sec tions. They are the descendants of the “ 1,000 families ” left behind by Jenghiz Khan as a colony in the Oxus y alley. They muster about 6,000 fighting men, of which some 4,000 are armed. Many enlisted in the Khurasan Levy Corps, which was disbanded in 1921. With training they make good soldiers. A regiment of Hazaras was recruited in Quetta in 1904. The first recruits were all taken from refugees from Afghanistan. After a few years the supply of recruits failed to a great extent and later recruits were obtained practically entirely from settlers in Khurasan. Nowadays the Regiment sends a recruiting party annually to Meshed. The Hazaras who had served in the Indian Army or in the Khurasan Levy Corps during the War in Persia, and who had since migrated to and settled in Khurasan, have been given land north-west of Bujnurd where a Hazara, colony has been formed. This project had been kept pend ing with the Persian Authorities for a considerable time, but was finally approved by the Shah in September 1928. Under the Perso-Afghan Treaty of 1921, Berberis who migrated into Persia from Afghanistan, before the establish ment of the Afghan legation in Tehran, are Persian subjects.54 pafding So far as the British authorities in Persia are concerned, a r it would seem that Hazaras (Berheris) having relations lire onto with us fall into four categories : — , u^ibei (a) Those who migrated from Afghanistan to India, probably who obtained a domicile in India, and finally Berto r coming to Meshed for the pilgrimage, or trade, Talley, if are now staying there temporarily or permanently. are the : (b) The descendants of (a), often born in India, -who ;;r!H c have come to their parents in Meshed. urestron: (c) Those who emigrated from Afghanistan to Persia (b) 9 a and subsequently enlisted in the Indian Army l-Haidari and earned a pension. mltivatio: (d) Those who emigrated from Afghanistan to Persia, ZiAai or their descendants born in Persia, who enlisted in the Indian Army or in one of the two Levy • Corps during the Great War, and were discharged Tbe t after good service, but without pension. Ibis tribe ... for recni The nationalities of the above four classes has been Tere no |, decided as follows : — Class (a) are Persian subjects, unless they have had (!) Ba themselves naturalised in India (which in nearly lurasan all cases they have omitted to do) or unless they Sarakbs t have obtained Afghan passports since their arrival ^ m{ in Persia. Class (b) are British subjects, provided they were born in India. Class (c) and (d) are Persian subjects by the 2nd addi tional article of the Perso-Afghan Treaty of 1921 (mentioned above). The chief occupation of the tribe is agriculture, but they have also many smiths, saddlers and carpenters. They hate the Afghans and despise the Persians, but, notwith standing this, many of them have married Persian wives. (5) Turks are widely spread over Khurasan and are influential beyond their numbers. Besides the considerable numbers of Causasian and Tabriz! Turks engaged in trade and transportation on the main routes, and in sedition in the cities, the principle clans are Afshar, Chulai and Qarai. The chief of the first-named is Fath-ul-Mulk, the Khan of Kalat-i-Nadiri, to whose house and tribe the fortress and Zflrdc district were given as a fief by Nadir Shah for the safe-55 guarding of the frontier against the Turkomans. Tlies« links aie virile and warlike in their own fashion. Thev live on horseback, have good animals and rifles, and provide a number of irregulars for the Persian Government They probably muster 1,500 fighting men with “3 line” and Berdan rifles. Akin to them are the Kizilbash of the Jam V alley, who live mostly around Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam These are the same tribes as the inhabitants of the Chandawal quarter of Kabul whose kinsmen live in Peshawar They are strongly pro-British. (6) Qarais. -The Qarais reside in the Turshiz and Turbat- i-Haidari districts, and are almost entirely employed in cultivation. The two most important Qarai Sardars are Zulfarkar Khan and Jaffar Khan, both of whom provide a certain number of sowars and infantry for the Persian Army. The tribe probably consists of about 4,000 families. This tiibe is locally reported to be one of the best sources for recruits in Persia, particularly for cavalry, but they were not enlisted in either the Khurasan or Seistan Lew Corps. (/) Baluchis. There are several nomad Baluch tribes in Khurasan residing, in various seasons of the year, from Sarakhs to Gaisur. The most important of these are: — Salar Khanis—The tribe is headed by Sardar Salar Khan, wdiose headquarters are at Aliak in the Bakharz district. The tribe is said to consist of about 500 families. A few reside in the Rui Khaf area. Salar Khan is now addicted to opium and has lost a lot of the influence he originally possessed. He has been a well known raider, and terrorised the districts of Turbat-i-Haidari and Bakharz. Ibrahim Khanis .—The tribe is headed by Sardar Ibra him Khan and Alam Khan, who reside in the encampments around Jangal, Bagh Bakhshi, and Gaisur during the winter months, and collect in the neighbourhood of Shahan-i-Bala and Aliak during the hot weather. There are said to be some 1,200 fighting men in the tribe. Zardad Khanis .—The tribe is headed by Sardar Rusul Khan and Aziz Khan.56 Jan 'Beals .—The tribe is headed by Sardar Mir Ahmed Khan and contains about 1,000 fighting men. The members of the tribe claim to be the subjects of the Shuja-ul-Mulk, a Taimuri by birth and resident of Taibad. During the winter months, the tribe is much scattered, but in the summer are to be f ou _ ncl m the neighbourhood of Sarakhs and Zorabad. Murad Khanis.—The tribe is headed by Sardar Murad Khan, and contains about 200 males. They spend their time in raiding the flocks of Baluchis and Persians living around Kidri, Jumin, Amrani, and Gaisur. Sardar Murad Khan, with 25 Jambazis served in the Seistan Levy Corps. The Khurasan Baluchis in recent years have depended almost entirely on the manufacture of carpets and trade in “ ghi ” as a means of livelihood, though in the past they were notorious for their raiding activities, and prior to the institution of Amnieh posts in the Amrani plain the main road from Jumin to Turbat-i-Haidari was liable to frequent Baluchi raids. (8) Arabs .—The tribe is said to have emigrated from Arabia about 7 centuries ago, and to have settled in the Qainat and Khaf districts. About one-third of the tribe are Shiahs and two-thirds Sunnis. The Sunnis reside in the district known as Sunni Khana and also in the Khaf district near the town of Shahr-i-Nau. The Shiahs are to be found around Khur, Chahak and Muhammadabad. The Sunnis number about 2,500 males and Shiahs 800. All are cultivators. Three troops of Arabs enlisted in the Seistan Levy Corps but were disbanded as the men were found to be Uireliable. Other tribes are Mirs, Aghas, Ghulas in the Shusp area, and Balovis in the Sarbisheh district. A few Tajiks, Zanganehs and Maldars are met with in the Rui Khaf area. The last named are a nomadic tribe.( b ) Sbistan. According to the enumeration by the Arbitration Com mission (1902—1905), the total population of Seistan waa then 136,591 souls. This number is fluctuating from con stant emigration between Persian and Afghan territory. Generally speaking, the Baluchis, Brahuis, Afghans, Tajiks and Arabs here are Sunnis, some 30,000 in number. The remainder of the population are Shiah. Some Baluchi headmen call themselves Shiahs to curry favour with Per- sian officials. There is no religious feeling in Seistan, nor antagonism between sects. Priestly and religious classes exercise considerable influence and are men of authority. The inhabitants of Persian and Afghan Seistan are indentical from an ethnological point of view. Both are a medley of heterogeneous races and tribes, Persian, Arab, Turkish, Baluch, Brahui, Afghan, etc. The Baluch, Brahui and Nauri are noted fighters and display considerable fearlessness especially on looting and raiding excursions. An important feature in connection with recruitment for the Seistan Levy Corps was that recruiting was done entirely through local Sardars, who sent in complete tribal troops with nominated leaders who were appointed Jemadars. The most important tribes are: — Sinjarani .—Sinjarani Baluchis who came originally from .Baluchistan about 1800 A.D. It is questionable whether the tribe is a branch of the Taukhi Baluch, but undoubtedly all the other Taukhi tribes in Seistan ostensibly owe allegiance to them. The present Sardar, Haji Khan, son of Khan Jehan Khan, is a nonentity, addicted to opium smoking, in consequence of which the repute of the tribe is suffering. The Chakansur portion of the tribe under Sardars Ata Muham mad Khan and Taj Muhammad Khan is very flourishing. Fighting men 1,500; Rifles 2,000 old, but serviceable. Nauri .-—Nauri Baluchis, settled in the villages of Khwaja Ahmad and Jalalabad. They number 400 families, and are important, because their Sardar, Khudadad Khan, son of Said Khan, is first cousin to Amir Hisa-ud-Dauleh, the representa tive of the senior line of the Amirs of Qainat.58 Fighting men 2,000; Rifles 2,000, old, but servW able. The Nauri would be invaluable in the event of having to swim horses across the Rud-h Seistan, Helmand, or Rud-i-Rarian. He is fear less and, irrespective of the current flowing, is able to swim the most stubborn horse across in a few minutes. The Nauri is of fine build and would make an excellent soldier. Taulchi. All the other Baluchis of Seistan belong to sections of this tribe. The principal are Saruni 450 families, Jamalzai 300, Gurgich 400. Hrahui. Two sections of the Muhammad Hasani branch of the tribe are found round about Lutak. They are the Yaghizai and Zerkari, whose headmen are respectively named Juma Khan and Nuzar 'Jan. They number 800 families. Sarbandi. 3,000 families scattered all over the country. The principal Farsiwan (Shiah) tribe of Seistan' The Sardar, Purdil Khan, and his son Ali Khan possess great local influence. The Brahui and Sarbandi tribes together could raise 4,000 fight- ing men, and have about 3,000 old, but service able rifles. Shakraki. Farsi wans, about 1,000 families. 200 fight ing men and few rifles. Rhimar. —Farsiwans, 250 families. Zarakzni, Baluch, 300 families. A somewhat lawless nomad tribe, who graze their camels along the frontier between the Hamun and Duruh. They raided convoys and travellers several times ’n 1916, but subsequently enlisted freely in the Seistan Levy Corps. 150 fighting men and 50— 100 rifles. Shebak .—A Shiah nomad tribe, one branch of whom (100 families) wander between Neh and Safedawa, while another lives in north Qainat. Their head men cultivate a little land in Seistan. 70—100 fighting men and few rifles. Murrai.—A small Baluch tribe (100 families) who pro fess to be subject to Sardar Khudadad Khan Nauri. Habitat, the Palagan Kuh lowlands. Practically no fighting men or rifles.drd .Ee/rati .—Farsiwan noir.ad tribe (100 families), who monopolize almost all the camel transport work in Seistan, working between Kuh-i-Malik Si ah and Birjand. They claim to have originally come from Herat. Practically no fighting men or rifles. Arabs. -Mir Arabs. Shiahs, 40 families. Their head- man, Mir Ali Akbar of Bunjar, is a very influen tial Kadkhuda. Untrustworthy. JSaiyqd .—Saiyad (the name is the Arabic for hunter) are a race of fisherman and wiidfowlers who live on the edge of the Hamun. They speak a peculiar dialect and are regarded as aboriginals. They are small, dark, poor, mean and timid. They know the Hamun to perfection, are useful ferry men (tutinchi) and guides on the waters. They have an official headman or Kadkhuda who keeps in touch with authorities, Persian and Consular. There are about 700 families. fiHaiyid .—A family claiming descent from the Prophet Muhammad through his grandson Husain. There are about 300 such families in Seistan scattered generally through the chief -villages, where the heads officiate as Mullahs. The leading Mullah, Haji Mir S&amp;iyfd Ali, owns considerable property at AKabad. Other influential men are Iftikhar- Tish-Sharia of Daudi, Rais ul Islam of Chilling, Haji Mir Saiyid Ali of Gauri, and Saiyid Abdullah of Burj-i-Mir-GuL Daulatabad Khwaja Ahmad Seh Kuha Xala-i-Nau Kala-i-Kuhneh .

M 1 LY BVPORT -to60 - All the above Sardars proved very loyal throughout the Great War,^ and it was chiefly due to their co-operation that the Seistan Levy Corps was raised and maintained. Were operations contemplated anywhere in the Seistan Province, these Sardars could be relied upon to render every assistance to the British. The most important of the Seistan tribes are enumerated above. In addition to the above, the following Baluch tribes are to be found who have migrated from Baluchistan and Afghanistan: — Makahis. The tribe contains probably 100 families, who have migrated from Afghanistan. All are Sunnis and form one of the finest fighting tribes in the Province. Kudbedanis .—The tribe contains about 300 families who have migrated from Afghanistan. Representatives of most of the Baluch tribes of Seistan were enlisted in the Seistan and Khura san Levy Corps, and proved good soldiers and amenable to discipline. The whole population is miserably poor. The greater portion are content to subsist on water melons as long as the supply lasts, and beg, borrow or steel for the rest of the year. The country swarms with robbers patronised by leading men. The Seistani, if encouraged, is cheerful and willing to work. He has a sharp intellect, is easy to teach, has a sense of humour and is easy to control. His chief imple ment is a sharp adzelike spade wdiich he uses with extra ordinary skill for everything. They are not courageous generally, but fear no danger in water, from flooded rivers, etc. They are patient and enduring in blizzards and heat. ✓61 CHAPTER IV. RESOURCES. 1. KHUKASAN—GENERAL. The greater portion of Khurasan consists of &lt;c Kavir ” and desert, and is barren and desolate. There are, however, considerable cultivated areas in the districts of Kuchan and Chinaran, Meshed, Darreh Jaz, Nishapur, and Bujnurd. Patches of cultivation of varying extent will be found in the vicinity of all towns and villages. The total produce in any year depends on the local political situation, the degree of pressure brought to bear on the cultivators by the Government, and the extent of rainfall. The crops are also liable to suffer from locusts. It will be seen therefore that the estimates given in this report are very rough, and can but represent a probable average. Wheat is the principal cereal, and lucerne the principal fodder of this area, wood is the normal fuel, but charcoal is also produced. A coal mine situated some 12 miles S. W. of Meshed is now (January 1930) being worked by' the Meshed Shrine authorities. The coal produced from this mine is considered to be of a satisfactory quality, and it is hoped that eventually it will be possible to develop this mine, and thus gradually to substitute coal for wood as the normal fuel in the vicinity of Meshed. The Hauj (hide) of land is the most reliable unit for estimating the output of a district. It represents the amount that can be ploughed by a yoke of oxen. In this province in average soil this is 20 Kharwars. (1 Kharwar = about 500 lbs.) Inhabitants will not usually disclose the amount of their annual crop, or the revenue they pay; hence enquiries should be directed towards the number of ploughs they use. Requisitioning officers should remem ber that the country has been plundered from time immemorial. 2. SEISTAN—GENERAL. Persian Seistan is an oasis averaging about 35 miles from north to south and 25 miles from east to west. Hav ing a rainfall of only 2 or 3 inches a year (during the c 262 winter months) its fertility depends on irrigation from th&amp; river Helmand, and this irrigation depends on a bund across the river at Kuhak, which has to be_ renewed yearly about July—August, when the water is at its lowest. Water being more plentiful in winter* it is the winter crops, wheat and barley, which form the bulk of the pro duce. An enemy by interfering with the bund could entire ly prevent cultivation. The oasis of Afghan Seistan Joins the oasis of Persian Seistan on the east. It also depends on the Helmand, but not on the bund at Kuhak. Formerly the boundary of Persian and Afghan Seistan was the lower course of the Helmand: but in 1896, as the results of a flood the lower part of the Helmand changed, and the mam stream now separates, not Afghanistan from Seistan, but Mian Kangf from the rest of Persian Seistan. The oasis of Persian Seistan, being the chief gram bear ing centre of the Qainat, Seistan and tho Sarhad, has to support not only its own population, but in bad years m the Qainat, to export largely to the Qainat, and at times,, to support a large nomad Baluch population- Owing to the lack of water in the hot weather the people have to rely on their winter crops to maintain them for the whole year. The available surplus of wheat is there fore small iu proportion to the amount of wheat grown. With a modern System of irrigation and more intense cultivation, the cultivated area could he doubled and the crop trebled, but owing to the lack of near markets the orop tends naturally, not greatly to exceed the amount, which can be consumed locally, or is normally needed tor export. The cultivation suffers, in years when the river is high,, from floods which indeed cause more damage than drought. Harvest is from the 1st May to the 15th June, buti stocks of grain and bhooea do not become, really abundant till the latter half of August. Purchases for the year should be made before the 151fe October and as much as possible should be collected before the new year. Half the revenue of Seistan fs paid to the Government in kind. It has been tlie custom for the Indian Govern ment to purchase as much as possible of this, grain share; through the British Consulate ip Seistan.G3 From information supplied by the British forces operat ing in Seistan in 1915-1920, it is estimated that the ayei age yearly amount of grain and bhoosa available for military requirements, in Indian maunds, may be said to be: Maunds. 100,000 80,000 150,000 Wheat Barley Bhoosa 3.

Winter crops are known as Viljar. (Khurasan and Qainat.) (a) Meshed—Is a large and fertile district. Tire chief crops are wheat, barley, dhal, tobacco and fruit. Potatoes, are also available, together with other vegetables which are plentiful. The crops are usually sown in November and Decern ier and are reaped in June and July. Cotton is also grown, but is used locally in the manu facture of carpets.64 There are two steam flour mills and one water mill which are capable of a large output. (b) Turbat.—The chief crops in the district are barley and wheat. The former is reaped about the end of May and the latter about the end of June. They are usually sown just before the. beginning of winter. fc) Bui Khaf Area .—The principal crops are barley, wheat gram, dhal and tobacco. These are sown from October to the end of November and reaped in June and July. Gevarz (or China) is sown in January and reaped in June and July. The following are the average crops taken in a good year: — Maunds (Indian). Wheat 60,000 Barley 30,000 Govarz 20,000 Gram 3,000 Dhal 3,000 Turnips 30,000 Tobacco 1,300 Bhoosa 360,000 These crops are entirely dependent on rain. There are several wind mills which produce on an average 2,000 luaunds (Indian) of flour monthly. In addition to the above, there are 30 water mills which are capable of grinding between 300 and 400 lbs. of corn per diem. Nearly everyone has a hand mill. (d) Gunabad District and Tun .—Crops consist of wheat barley, hay and vegetables, sown in November and harvested in June. In addition there is a certain amount of cotton grown (about 2,000 maunds) and a small quan- * * As the local demand for bhoosa is slight, most of it is usually wasted only half of the stalks being reaped, and much is wasted during threshing and subsequently. To secure a good bhoosa crop it is neces sary to start in March and April to educate local opinion and induce the big lessees to get their bhoosa cut low. This is not very easy, and nothing except a continued large demand for bhoosa could he expected to secure really economical harvesting.65 tity of opium. The country is very fertile and very productive. In years when the rainfall is good crops o£ all cereals are trebled. There are several water mills in the district. Their average amount of output is about 12 maunds daily. (e) Qain .—Crops which consist principally of wheat and barley, are sown in October and March respectively and are harvested in June and July. Vegetables such as tur nips potatoes and beet are also grown in small quantities. (f) The most productive areas of the Qainat are: — Produce. Julgeh Sunni Khaneh . Julgeh Majan Zirkuh Julgeh Khusf Nimbulak (Qain Khidri). (g) Shusp Area.—The principal cereals grown are wheat, barley, and arzan. Half the land lies fallow each year. Wheat and barley are sown m October and December respectively, and reaped in June or July accord ing to the nature of the season. Arzan is sown m June and reaped after three months. Vegetables are also grown of which the principal crop is turnips. Wheat, barley, khasil, cotton seed and millet. Wheat, barley, beet, cotton seed and millet. Wheat, barley, grapes and raisins. Cotton, wheat, fruit and millet. Wheat, barley, cotton and opium. (Seistan.) The harvest is about 15th May to 15th June. Crons in Seistan are of two classes, (o) spring (b) immer and autumn. Spring crops ^msist of wheat, arlev adas (pulse), mushukeh (pulse) ad &lt; ummer and autumn crops consist of water melons, melons, lillet, maize, mash (pulse), cotton and sesame. Spring Crops—Wheat, adas and mushukeh are sown tom the^middle of September, till the middle of h&gt;ecem- er- barley from the middle of December till the end of Jarch, and arzan (millet) is sown towards the end of darch. The barley harvest begins about 1st May a iheat, adas, mushukeh and arzan harvests a fortm^t ater Some barley is also sown m November. This is cutGG green from the middle of March onward and is known as khasil. Summer and autumn crop—Melons, water melons, millet and maize, mash and sesame are sown from the end of March to the end of April, and reaped from July to September. Cotton is sown about the same time as these and is picked from the middle of November. Amount gathered in a good year. Spring crop—Total amount of grain gathered is about 960,000 maunds, Indian, of which two-thirds are wheat and one-third barley. Bhoosa about half that amount. Khasil 32,000 maunds, Indian; Adas 800 maunds, Indian. The number of mills in Seistan is believed to be : — Wind mills ....... 7 Water mills ...... 2 Mills worked by cattle .... 150 Hand mills about 7,000 4. Grazing. (a) Khurasan .—The hill-sides in Northern Khurasan provide ample grazing for the flocks of the Kurds, Turks, Baluchis, Taitnuris, Hazaras and Turkomans. South of Turbat-i-HaidaA, on the other hand, the hill-sides are dry and barren. (b) (Seistan.—Other than the rank grasses in the naizar, and the dhub grass which grows along the edges of the water courses and in moist places, there is very little grazing for horses or mules in Seistan. The Seistan donkey is able to eat many bushes and weeds w T hich horses or mules or Indian donkeys could not eat. It can eat almost anything that a camel can. Camel thorn flourishes in the Seistan oasis, especially from June to October, in sufficient quantity to furnish the staple food of many thousands of camels if the animals are free to graze. This is supplemented by other growths, especially tamarisk near the Rud-i-Parian, and by the un cut portion of the straw. Local camel owners prefer barley bhoosa in th,e hot weather and wheat barley in the winter; but the local camel does not thrive unless grazing is avail able, especially in the hot weather. Other grazing plants, which are wholesome and are sometimes found in useful quantities, are “ jandi ” and phog ”.G7 5. Fuel. (a) Coal. In September 1929 a coal mine was discovered at a point some 12 miles S. W. of Meshed. It is now (1930) being exploited and is the property of the Meshed shrine. It is as yet impossible to estimate what its output will be, but it is hoped by the mining engineer now r employed on this mine that it will eventually be possible to supply the whole of Meshed with fuel exclusively from this mine. The coal is transported to Meshed by carts. Its average price in Meshed is Krans 40 per Kharwar (approx. 500 lbs.). There is another coal mine in the area of Persian Sarakhs which also supplies Meshed with coal, the price of the latter is Krans 70/80 per Kharwar in Meshed. Coal appears to exist all over the hills forming the western boundary of the Meshed Valley from Nishapur in the south to Fariz in the north, seven miles W. of Jumab village on the Meshed-Virani-Kufchan road, and 200 feet above the valley; and from Zorabad in the east to Ak Darband between Zorabad and Meshed. It is sometimes for sale in the bazaars of Shahrud. As the Persians as yet have merely removed coal where found close to the surface it is possible that the mineral is much more widely diffused. The coal is of good quality, especially that found at Naoghandar, a village 6 miles north of Gulistan on the Jagherq road, and 18 miles from Meshed, whence carts can come to within a mile or so of Naoghandar. Not more than 100 feet of tunnelling is here needed and the seam is up to nine inches thick, and woith working immediately. This coal is of first class quality, free from shale sul phides and inorganic mixture. About a mile south of Naoghandar are several other abandoned workings, comprising a fine seam of coal, banded With mineral matter and carboniferous shale totalling b feet thick. Lignite exists at Farizi. Coal is diffused over the Arafi region and at Zorabad and Ak Darband. Large quantities ire reported in the Arab region, about 18 miles S. W. ol Meshed. It is also reported near Khan Rud and Buzwish.68 (b) Wood. (a) Meshed .—Wood fuel is good and plentiful. The best fuel is plane and apricot, and for stores mulberry. Poplar which contains a large proportion of water is of little use. The average prices at present (1930) are; — Krans. Ppr Kharwar. Plane (Chinar) . 50 Apricot . i . 45 Mulberry . 35 Poplar .... . 55 Walnut .... . 40 ... (b) Bui Khaf .—Firewood is plentiful in the mountains to the North of the town of Rui Khaf and in the vicinity pf Qasimabad. Wood for building purposes can be ob tained from Nishapur, Samagaum Arab, and Gundam Shah. - -(c) Gunabad and Tun .—Fuel is plentiful, and consists of fruit trees obtained locally and timber from Bai-Kuh, 16 miles S. W. of Jumin. (d) Qain .—Fuel is not plentiful in the immediate vici nity of Qain, but a plentiful supply is available in the surrounding district principally from Farukhi and Buznabad. 6. Transport. (a) Khurasan. (i) Motor Transport. —(a) In January 1930 there were a total of 115 private cars (mostly of American and Cana dian makes) and 56 three ton, 15 two ton and 242 one ton lorries registered in Meshed. (b) Petrol is obtainable in the following places: — (i) Duzdap-Meshed road. (ii) Meshed-Tehran road. (in) Meshed-Bajgiran road. Duzdap, Khunik, Birjand, Qain, Bedukht, Turbat-i-Haidari, Meshed. Nishapur, Sabzawar, Shahrud, Damghan, Semnan. Kuchan.Prices of petrol, which vary in the above named towns and villages, are dependent on the distance of the latter from the main bases of supply; thus in January 1930 the price of 1 Pood ( = 36 lbs.) of Petrol at Duzdap was Krans 26at Birjand Krans 29, at Qain Krans 32 and in Meshed Krans 35. (ii) Horse transport .—North of Birjand, and between the main towns, such as Meshed, Sabzavar, Kuchan Bujnurd and Askhabad, the two or four horsed fourgon is the normal horsed vehicle. These vehicles are usually in the hands of Caucasian or Tabriz! Turks, as are the numerous phaetons of Meshed city. The four horsed fourgon will carry 2,000 lbs., will average 4^—5 miles an hour and use any track that is passable for a field gun. They are like farm wagons about 10'x2' 6', the sides splaying out to about 6'. Covering is • afforded by wooden bands which are arched over and usually covered by tarpaulins. In the North the two-wheeled “ araba ” of Turkistan is to be found with one pony in the shafts. These carry about 500 lbs. A force should be able to impress some 100 fourgons and 300 arabas in the Meshed-Bujnurd area. (iii) Camels, can be divided into two categories: — (a) The Kurdish (including Bactrian Turkoman). (b) The Baluchi (including Herat!, etc.). The former will carry a load of 430 lbs., march 3 miles an hour and will traverse tracks which are barely passable for Indian mules. Their saddlery, which includes strong wide girths and breast plates is, as a rule, good. The latter will carry a load of some 500 lbs., march a little over 2 miles an hour and are of little use in hilly country. Their saddlery is, as a rule, of poor quality and defective. (iv) Mules.—The mule carries a load of about 350 lbs., will march 4J miles an hour, cover 20 to 25 miles a day, and can keep up with infantry over anything but the roughest going. He is hardy and willing and needs no grooming..70 Sore backs are very rare, as the saddle (Palan) is light and has a large bearing surface. The Persian mule-driver (Charvardar) away from the seductions of a town, is hard working, cheerful, and honest and kikes a pride in his work. (b) Seistan. (i) Seistan is unhealthy for mules and horses and there are few ©f these available for transport purposes. (ii) Donkeys, form the principal means of local transport as they are less susceptible to diseases than horses and camels. They will carry a load of 200 lbs., march 4 miles an hour and an average distance of 20 miles a day. It is estimated that about 600 donkeys could be im pressed for military purposes. (iii) Camels .—These are mostly bred locally and appear' to be less susceptible to surra and other diseases than camels from outside. From January to June camels are usually taken to the hills to graze and during this period it is probable that only about 200 would be immediately available. In the winter of 1918 and summer of 1919, local camels were needed to take 30,000 maunds (Indian) of supples per month from Seistan to the line of communications, and to lift 5,000 to 6,000 maunds (Indian) a month over each section of the line of communications between Shusp and Jumin, and between Qain and Itui Khaf. The required transport was promptly produced. The number of local camels was augmented occasionally, but especially during the period October to March, by camels which belong, for the most part, to Baluchis and Afghans. Seistan is liable to be cut off during the period Febru ary to September from the West bank of the Hamun by water which may extend to a breadth of 12 miles. The water will seldom be too deeu for an unloaded camel to ford. On such occasions loads have to be ferried across on reed rafts, or pontoons if available and the water is deep enough for them. 'When the water is very deep camels also have to be ferried across. 7. A note on Horses and Mules in Khurasan. (a) The Persian Dorse, possesses good bone ami substance, hut is coarse bred in appearance. Owing to71 fe&amp;viftg beeR riddeii or loaded while they are very young they generally suffer from saddle and girth galls, splints, and spavins. Nevertheless they are hardly and able to g® long distances and carry heavy loads. Those used for riding or draught are usually about 14-2 hands m height, ■and are almost all entires. For such a horse 40 miles is an average march which they will cover at a fast walk and “ tripple ” in e, hours or less. The pack pony stands from 13-3 to 14-1 hands arid will carry a load of 200 lbs. Its back is generally permanently galled and it is usually underfed. •(b) The Turkoman Horse is bigger and better bred than the Persian but is not so suitable for cavalry work, as tey are unsuitable for weight carrying. They are ridden at a very early age and are therefore usually unsound before they are 5 years old. (c) Mules. —The Persian mule is, on the whole bigger than the Indian and carries heavier l oads. They a hardy and will do long marches. A load of 350 ibs. m siot excessive. (d) The best horse and mule producing districts are: — m Persian and Turkoman horses and mules. * Persian and Turkoman hors.es and mules. Persian and Turkoman horses and mules. * Persian horses and a Tew Turk# mans. Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam . Persian horses. ’Turbat-i-Haidari * Persian horses. Nishapur . • » Mules. Sabzavar . • » Mules. (e) Prices;-—At present (1930) the average^ pi horses and mules in Khurasan are as iol, °:' b ‘ Persian horse of ^superior quality, suited to ^ draft i • • , o(\ Persian horse of inferior »hty (n ^ Mules Birjand Kuchan Darreh Jaz Sarakhs77 CHAPTER V. ARMED FORCES. 1. Eastern Division. —The military forces stationed in the various towns of Khurasan and Seistan from the Eastern Division, which has its headquarters in Meshed. The General Officer Commanding, Eastern Divi sion (in January 1930—Amir-i-Lashkar His Highness Amanullah Mirza Jahanbani) is directly under the Chief of the General Staff in Tehran. 2. General remar'ks .—The main, if not the sole, mission of the Persian Army of to-day, is the maintenance of internal security and for this role its standard of efficiency is probably adequate. Thanks to the personal energy of the present General Officer Commanding, considerable pro gress has been made during the past 3 years in raising the standard of training and in improving the equipment and arms of the Division. Although the units display a very fair amount of smartness on parade, especially in close order drill, the Eastern Division as a fighting force can not yet be compared with units of a modern European Army. Many defects in tactical training are obvious and even glaring. The most efficient arm in the Division is undoubtedly the Artillery. The arms in the Infantry and Cavalry regiments particularly the rifles, show marked signs of general neglect and are, apparently, never oiled. These faults are primarily due to the shortage of which makes systematic and progressive training difficult, and supervision over even elementary matters inadequate. In the autumn of 1929 the Eastern Division was 125 officers short of normal establishment. This is particularly sen- ous in a conscript army with an inadequate supply ot capable N. C. Os. Another serious defect is the condition and quality of the equipment and uniforms. The latter m the case of fuU dresf and summer kit are good and serviceable but the winter clothing, particularly the great coats, m bad. The officers, on the other hand are invariably we turned out both in summer and winter. The present General Offl-r Commandmg^who recejved defects^and ^constantly trying to improve the efficiencyof kis command’s equipment by purchasing arms etc from the Government of India. The officers, generally speaking are young and unexperienced, though this defect js gradually being remedied by sending selected youths to l 1 renoh military schools. The Persian soldier is apparently very hardy, and re- qmres next to nothing for his creature comforts. Under efficient leaders he should prove to be first rate fightin-o- material. Conscription cannot be said to be popular, but thanks to strict discipline there are no apparent signs af discontent m hhp Eastern Division at present (1930). 3. The troops of the Eastern Division, the ration strength of winch is about 3,600, are now (January 19301 organised as follows : -— Divisional. Headquarters. MeShed Composite Brigade. Seistan Composite Brigade (February 1930, in Persian Baluchistan). Bujnurd Composite Regiment, ORDER OF BATTLE (January 1930). ’Eastern Division — Headquarters — Meshed.

One new Cavalry Regiment in progress of formation. * *Nohe.—I n October 1929 there was a surplus of about 400 men over the normal establishment and therefore a 4th (Training) Battalion was formed in this Regiment. This, however, is not in accordance with the authorised establishment and sanction for this 4th Battalion has so far (February 1930) not teen obtained from Tehran.T9 (b) Bujnurd Composite Regiment (stationed 'in Bujnurd with small detachments in the Saharai Turkoman district).

Cavalry—-Approximate 250 men. Artillery—2 guns. Note. —The Seistan Brigade, which together with the Kerman Brigade is at present (January 1930) in occupa tion of Persian Baluchistan, was until July 1929 under, the direct orders of the General Officer Commanding, Eastern Division. At the time of Dost Mohd. Khan s escape from Tehran in November 1929, when the_Persian authorities were apprehensive of a recrudescence of trouble in Baluchistan, the G. 0. C. Eastern Division was ordered bv Tehran to proceed to Khwash to take over temporary command of the troops stationed in Seistan and Baluchis tan. The Seistan Brigade is still (March 1930) a unit of the Eastern Division and under orders of the G. u - y- The whole of the newly occupied area of P ® rs ^ tan including the Gulf ports of Jask and Chabar com under the administrative control of the G. O. C. Eastern Division. 4.

(b) Cavalry: The 21st Bahrami Cavalry Regiment con sists of 4 Squadrons (107 men each) of 3 Troops each. Nos. 1 and 2 Squadrons form the 1st “Division” and Nos. 3 and 4 Squadrons form the 2nd “ Divizion ” The 4 Lewis Guns are distributed in the Regiment as follows: — Lewis Guns to each of the 2 “ Divizions ”. (e) Artillery: The 19th Artillery Regiment consists of 2 Batteries One of these is a 4 gun Horse Artillery Battery, sub-divided into 2 Sections of 2 Field Guns each Ihe second is a Mountain Pack Battery consisting of 4 10 Pr. British Mountain Pack Guns. (d) Divisional Signals exist, but not as a combatant unit, since they are employed only in Meshed as telephone operators, etc of the military exchange. All signallers employed in the field, either as telephone operators or with helms are found from the units themselves. The distribu- tion of field telephones and helms among the units of the Division is as follows : — (?) In 25th Shahpur 5 new German field telephones Regiment. with 15 Kilometres of wire and 8 Helios. GO In 21st Bahrami 5 new German Field telephones Regiment. w ith 15 Kilometres of wire and 6 Helios. &lt;.m) In 19th Artillery 6 new German Field telephones Regiment. with 18 Kilometres of wire.

Armament.-(i) 25th Shahpur Infantry Regiment: (a) Rifles: The 9 Rifle Companies of this Regi- ment are armed with the Long Lee Enfield Rifle, while the men of the Machine Gun81 Company of this regiment are armed with the Short—Lee Enfield. (b) Machine Guns: There are now 4 Vickers Maxims, firing -303 British S. A. A. and 4 Machine Guns of a Russian pattern. It is intended that the latter, which are the only weapons now in possession of the Meshed Brigade not adapted to the - 303 British S. A. A. should eventually be given to the Bujnurd Regiment, if 4 other Vickers Guns can be obtained from India. (c) Light Automatics: 12 Lewis Guns organised as shown in para. 4 (a) above. (ii) 21st Bahrami Cavalry Begiment: (a) Bifles: Short Lee Enfield. (b) Swords: Cossack Cavalry Swords. (c) Light Automatics: 4 Lewis Guns. (iii) 19th Artillery Begiment: (a) 4 Schneider 75 m.m.

(v) Seistan Brigade: (a) Bifles: Long Lee Enfields '303. (b) Machine Guns: Vickers Maxims -303. (c) Light Automatics: Lewis Guns '303. 6. Equipment.—All arms of the Eastern Division wear leather belt round the waist and a leather bandolier over be right shoulder. In addition to this one Battalion ot he Shahpur Regiment has been supplied with British Web 3 acks but, owing to shortage of funds, haversacks, belts ,nd ammunition pouches could not be purchased. 7 Clothing —The rank and file of this Division wear t Khaki blouse of the Russian pattern, breeches Patties aid in winter, marching boots of the Brlt ^ P^^ v ,, -Pp summer however they wear the.country Geevas 'canvas shoes), which appear to be far too light for roughWS©. Tn gummsf tljg men wear Khaki drill and in serge. GreaAtoats are made of c'ountry woven cloth known as “ karak ” which is cheap, though unserviceable. The life of a great coat is two years, whereas the cloth does not remain serviceable for more than 6 months. The cap, known jts the “ Kulah Pahlevi ’• is universally worn by all arms of the Division, with the exception of the Pack Battery w*kich is issued with steel helmets ©f the French pattern. Distinctive Facings of the various Arms :— The Divisional Staff wear Maroon shoulder straps and piping. The Infantry units Wear Bed shoulder straps and piping. The Cavalry units wear Light Green shoulder straps and piping. The Artillery units wear Blue shoulder straps and piping. ^ ^(Note—F or badges of rank of officers and N.C.Os. see plates I and S.

Training. —(i) Officers: The majority of the senior Persian Officers now serving in the army, received their early training under Bussian pre-revolutionary instructprs *nd soiled in the Persian Cossack Division. In view of this these senior officers invariably speak Bussian, while the Persian soldier is as follows: ■ Persian *Seers. 14 nS3 t]?,eir early training continues to leave a' distinct Russian influence on the Persian army of to-day (1930). A very limited number of these officers, however, received their military training in Europe. Since the accession to the throne of Reza Shah Pahlevi the corps of officers for the army is recruited from the following : — (a) Officers School in Tehran. (b) Commissions from the ranks. * (c) Specially selected candidates from Secondary Schools who are sent abroad (principally to France) to receive their military training in foreign military colleges. Officers belonging to the last-named category on joining their units after return to Persia are usually more ad vanced and efficient than the others. (ii) N. C. O.’s: A. .N. C. 0. ; s School directly under the Divisional Headquarters in Meshed was started in the summer of 1929. Prospective N. C. O.’s were selected from the conscripts and were then drafted into this school. The course lasts 6 months after which graduates are drafted into their units as N. C. O.’s. It is impossible to say, as yet, whether this scheme is satisfactory since these N. C. O.’s are conscripts and are due to be dis charged after 2 years’ service with the colours. In addition to the above, there is a limited number of N. C. O.’s and Warrant Officers who are serving with the Army on special engagements. (iii) The Privates are consdHpts who serve for two years with the dolours in all arms of the service. In the infantry a very large proportion of training is allotted to close order drill and ceremonial, at the expense of tacti cal training. The men (usually Kurds from Kuchan dis trict) drafted into cavalry units are generally speaking natural horsemen before joining the service, though much attention is given to “ Riding School ”. In the artillery unit the men carry out a great deal of gun drill and, thanks to there being several efficient instructors among the artillery officers, the two Batteries of the 19th Artillery Regiment are undoubtedly the best trained and the most efficient units in the Meshed garrison.85 said to be the best made in the U. S. S. * These engines are CHAPTER VI. AVIATION. The Persian Air Force. Organisation. —The Persian Air Force is concentrated In Tehran and there are no military machines permanently in Khurasan or Seistan. The Commander of the Air force (at present January 1930, Colonel Ahmad Khan) is under the orders of the General Staff at the Ministry of War. There is no air staff, but merely an office where a Persian pilot-mechanic functions as assistant commandant, and also as a general supervisor of the aerodrome and workshops. The strength of the Air Force in December 1929 was believed to be as follows: — Machines. (а) Junkers (310 H.P. engine) . . .2 (б) Spad Fighter with Hispano Suiza engine 1 (c) Breguet XIX with 12 cylinder engine. . 1 (d) D. H. 9 with 400 H. P. Liberty engine* (12 cylinders) . . • • * -21 Total . . .25 Of the above the Spad fighter is of a type that was obsolete at the end of the war. It is not m good con dition but is serviceable and flies occasionally. The Breguet XIX is a powerful machine. It is a two- seater with great lifting power. It has no special bomb carrying apparatus. It is not known with what engine this aircraft is fitted and consequently, no details of per formance can be given. It may be assumed, however, that it is considerably superior to that of the L&gt;. M. y. The D II 9 —Four of these arrived from the U. S. S. R. in September 1929, having flown from Pahlevi (Enzeli). Three of these latter are fitted to carry six bombs under each plane. The fourth appears to have been manufactured in the U S S R. and has a far better engine, capableof flying 140 hours without complete overhaul. This machine has no bomb-racks. The normal radius of action of a D. H. 9. is approximately 200 miles at a cruising speed of 80 m. p. h. and it can be assumed that these aircrafts have a similar perfermance. . 'There are no machine guns in any of the machines, though some have mountings for Colt machine guns and one of the Junkers is fitted for Lewis guns. It is said that machine guns will be fitted when neces sary. With the exception of the 3D. H. 9s mentioned above none of the machines are fitted with bomb dropping apparatus. It is possible that all war material comes from the U. S. S. R. On the other hand it is said that there is a munition factory 15 miles from Tehran, the engineers in which are German. All machines are bought from abroad. Personnel — Pilots—9 Persians (trained in the U. S. S. R. and France). 2 Germans—pilot-mechanics. 15 Foreign—mechanics. All Persian pilots and mechanics are trained either in the U. S. S. R. or in France. Workshops. —There is a general workshop near Tehran. The foremen are either Soviet subjects or Frenchmen. The hands ore with few exceptions Persians. Civil Aviation .—The Junkers Company has a monopoly of civil air service in Persia and, under their agreement, they are obliged to participate in internal military opera tions by lending both machines and personnel. None- of the Junkers machines, normally attached to the Persian Air Force, have been sold to the Persian Gov ernment. They are on loan and the Persian Government has to pay for any losses which occur. The Company is responsible for keeping all machines in repair. At the end of 1929, the engines of the Company’s machines were being changed. Formerly the engines were 310 H. P. petrol engines. The new engines have crude oil, and a 70 litre C. C. engine burning crude oil will develop 1000 H. P.87 Tehran-Meshed air line. —The Jtmkers Company arrange for a weekly service between Tehran and Meshed. A machine arrives in Meshed on Tuesdays at about I p.m. and leaves for Tehran on Thursdays at 6 a.m. A short stop is usually made en route at Maiamai. Tbe total time taken to cover the distance Tehran to Meshed is about 5 hours. Aerodromes .— (i) Meshed,. —Location immediately East of the Meshed-Duzdap road, 2 miles South of Meshed. Maximum dimensions for landing. —l,000 x x 4D0 X . Height above sea level. —3,197 feet. Soil. —Yellow clay, flat and smooth. Nature of surrounding country. —A valley. Hypes of machines, suitable for. —Junkers, D. H. 9, etc. Obstructions. —North, buildings; East and South, Nil; West, trees lining the road.

(a) The Governor General .—Khurasan is governed by a Governor General, who is directly under the Ministry of the Interior at Tehran. He is the representative of the Central Government. His duties in the past were to control the general administration and to maintain law and order. Under the present regime, however, the Gov ernor General has no power to interfere in the affairs of the various provincial branches of the Imperial Depart ments, as each of them is directly under its respective Ministry or Department in Tehran. The Governor General deals primarily with political matters, and maintains rela tions between the Foreign Consuls and the Persian Government. He is also responsible for the Nazmieh (police) and the Baladieh (Municipalities) within his province, though ac cording to the Persian Administrative Law these two de partments are directly under the Ministry of the Interior and communicate direct with Tehran. In actual practice, however, a strong Governor General can influence and assert authority in these departments in his province very considerably. He is, in the absence of the Mutavalli-Bashi, in charge of the Shrine. The Governor General’s Office consists of: — Salary Ts. Monthly. Governor General 750 Assistant G. G. . 124 Head Clerk .... 92 Five Clerks .... 235 Four farrashes 60 Allowance to Governor General Total 200 . 1,461(It) Governors of Districts .—Formerly Governors of all the districts were appointed by the Governor General, They received no pay, yet notwithstanding this, they would often bribe the Governor General in order to secure their appointments. The inhabitants of the Districts were therefore, practically speaking, sold by auction by the Governor General to the highest bidders who w T ere then appointed Governors. Under the old system District Governors controlled all judicial matters in their districts. This custom has now been abolished and all jurisdiction throughout all districts, is now in the hands of the Adlieh (Justice) Department. In 1927, when Amad-us-Saltaneh b atemi was Minister of the Interior, a law was passed to the effect that Governor's of districts should receive salaries. Nowadays (February 1930) Khurasan is subdivided into a number of districts, each administered by a Governor w’ho is appointed on the recommendation of the Governor General and confirmed in his appointment by the Ministry of the Interior. There are, however, still tw r o categories of District Governors, paid and unpaid. The total number of District Governors in Khurasan is 31, including Seistan and Duzdap. The following Districts are administered by Governors in receipt of salaries, which vary from 31 to 124 Tomans a month : — Duzdap, Sabzevar, Nishapur, Kuchan, Bujnurd, Turbat-i-Haidari, Tun (Firdusi), Tabas, Turshiz, Sarakhs and Darreh Jaz. Eight other districts are administered by Governors who are unpaid. The latter are all responsible to the Governor General, and perform the same duties as those who draw salaries. 2. Seistan. Seistan is only nominally under the Governor General of Khurasan, as the real Governor is the Amir-Shaukat-ul- Mulk, the semi-feudal lord of Qainat and Seistan, who is a man of considerable authority and influence, and is also very popular. He has nominated his two nephews, Hisam-ud- Dauleh as Governor of Birjand and Qain, and Samsam-ud- Dauleh as Governor of Seistan. They are directly under the Central Government at Tehran.91 Hisam-ud-Dauleh and Samsam-ud-Daulali each, receive Ts. 200 per month. The Governor of Duzdap is, now (March 1930) one Mehr Dad, whose pay is Ts. 124 monthly. He is nominated by the Ministry of the Interior. 3. Other Districts. Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam, Bakharz and Kalat-i-Nadiri are governed by the sons of the former local Sardars: — Shank at-ud-D auleh. Shuja-ul-Mulk. Fath-ul-Mulk. longer any Kalantars or Kalantars have Turhat-i-Shaikh Jam Bakharz Kalat-i-Nadiri Note.—T here are Kadkhudas in the now no districts or towns. been replaced by Police Officers and Kadkhndas by Gov ernors and Sub-Governors. Ilbegis and Ilkhams m the Turkoman country have been replaced by Governors. 4. Baladiyeh (Municipality). The Municipality is one of the Departments subordinat ed to the Ministry of the Interior, though m actual prac tice the Rais-ul-Baladiyeh (the Head ° f the Municipality e.g., Mayor) in Meshed comes directly under the Governor General. . The duties of the Baladiyeh are those a nor “* Municipal Council and include sanitation, public hygie , control of water supply and control of food P ri ces, ex i those articles imported from foreign countries etc., etc. The total annual revenue of the Baladiyeh m Mes le is about 70,000 Tomans. , Since October 1929, the Municipalities m the districts have been placed under the orders of the District Gover- nors, who are personally held responerble for administration of the Mnplc.paUtaes District Municipality normally consists of one cleiK a a few farrashes., 5. Nazmieh (Police). The Nazmieh, “ —MinltVV t^Intrior^ sl'is KminaUy^nd/ths .Governor General, J4IXiY REPOT! ' —The Nazmieh Department throughout Persia is in actual fact under the direct control of H. M. the Shah. The Nazmieh in the Provinces maintain direct and secret correspondence with their Central office at Tehran. Nazmieh (Police) stations are to be found in the follow ing districts: — Sabzevar, Nishapur, Turbat-i-Haidari, Kuchan, Bujnurd, Turshiz, Sarakhs, Birjand, Duzdap, Seistan and Dara Jaz. 6. Adlieh. (i) Adlieh (Justice Department) is subordinate to the ■Ministry of Justice and the Governor General does not interfere at all with this Department. There are four courts in Meshed : — (а) Sulhieh (hearing of cases involving sums not exceding Ts. 500); (б) “ Primary ” Law Court; (c) Criminal Court (this Court hears also commercial cases); and (d) Court of Appeal. There are two Public Prosecutors, one for the Primary Law Court, and the other for the Court of Appeal. (ii) Adlieh Courts have been established in the following Districts: — (a) Primary CWfs.—Sabzawar, Nishapur, Turbat-i- Haidari, Birjand (for Qainat and Tabas) Kuchan. (5) Sulhieh Courts .—Duzdap (for Seistan), Turshiz (Appeals, referred to Primary Court at Turbat- i-Haidari). There are no Courts in the Districts of Turbat-j-Shaikh Jam, Bakharz, and Kalat-i-Nadiri. 7. Department of Public Instruction. The Department of Public Instruction under the Minis try of Public Instruction, Tehran, is also an independent office over which tho Governor General has no definite control.93 Safedava and Duzdap. ^ 2 8. Waqf Property—Auqaf (Church lands and religious bequests). (a) There is a special Department, under the Ministry of Public Instruction, which deals with the Auqa . Khurasan is the most important province m Persia from the point of view of the Auqaf. One-third of the tota area of the Province is Auqaf propery. The total annual income of the Auqaf in Khurasan is over two million Tum&amp;ns One-tenth of this income goes to the Government Treasury and the rest is spent under the orders of the Auqaf Department. (a) The maiority of the Auqaf of Khurasan be ong o the shrine o” Imam Reaa. These Auqaf have always been controlled by the reigning Shah through the ^utava Bashi who is his representative and deals with the att of the shrine. . , . f The other Auqaf are controlled by the Ulema (chief 9.

Work on the roads of algo being95 1928, however, the two offices have been placed under single control. The number of the employees of the two offices in Meshed and districts is about 150. There are Post and Telegraph offices in the following localities: — Bajgiran, Kuchan, Bujnurd, Shirvan, Chinaran, Kariz, Esferain, Lutfabad, Kalat-i-Nadari, Khakistar (there is a Telegraph Office only at Khakistar), Birjand. There is a Post Office at Faruj and Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam and Telephone Offices at Robat Safiod and Ismailabad. Note. —The offices of Nishapur and Sabzavar are under Tehran. Seistan, Duzdap and Turbat-i-Haidari also are *nder Tehran and not under , Meshed. 15. Tanzifiyeh (Sanitation Department). The Sanitation Department, Meshed, is under the Sanitation Department, Tehran. There is no Ministry of Public Health. In Meshed the Doctors employed by the Municipality are responsible for public sanitation. Doctors responsible for sanitation in the districts are paid by the Sanitation Department.CHAPTER VIII. COMMUNICATIONS. 1. Railways. The only railway existing in this area runs from Mirjawa to Duzdap, being a continuation of the broad gauge line from Quetta to Mirjawa, which forms part of the North-Western Railway system. It was commenced in 1918 for the purpose of simplifying the communications of the British Force on the Trans Caspian border, and was completed in February 1919. The length of the line is 52 miles. There are no inter mediary stations between Mirjawa and Duzdap. For lay-out of these see places in the pocket at the end of the book. Detraining Facilities .— Mirjawa— One end-unloading ramp. One small high level platform for unloading animals. Duzdap— One end-unloading ramp. Two high level platforms of 300 feet each for unload ing animals. Water (a) Mirjawa. Water is available both for loco motive and for drinking purposes. The supply is obtained from the Ladis river four miles from the station. The total supply available in the river, during the dry season, is 57,000 gallons per hour. Of these 30,000 gallons per hour are brought to the station. Of these 30,000 gallons only 15,000 gallons per hour are allotted to the railway. The remaining 15,000 gallons are delivered to the villagers for cultivation, but in emergency can be turned into the railway overhead tank of 10,000 gallons capacity. The pipe line consists of one 12-inch earthenware piping one mile long, delivering into a 400,000 gallons reservoir” from whence it gravitates by two six-inch cast iron pipes to the station. Arrangements have been made for the filling of six passenger coaches at a time from overhead piping. There are four hydrants from which passengers can obtain water.97 The overhead tankage capacity of the station is 10,000 wells joined by a tun o-allons per hour, pumped into The total supply is W.OOO | H 000 P Uons capacity, and ^‘^ZTteTptafy rerheld ta nk g „ f 3,000 gallons, 'pipeTne is 6 -inch cast iron and is all wrth.n the 'and Mirjawa there is no -ter ^ Water for the stafi rs “™ t l rs b y Ta t r r y a ^ t Zm 1,600 to into temporary ground res &gt;. ^ staff employed, o 000 gallons capacity according Up+ween ^'^elegrdph.-—There caih^ay^i^^nly! 6 ^ 6611 Duzdap and f r l^'” aIent way consist of Permanent Way.—Ihepe WO oden sleepers. 75 lbs. rails, Br.trsh standard section, O f ^ ^ AU th There is only one eulvert of t P dips or small gaining waterways are met^w ^ ^ pipe drains, ine ruling g for ^ ug0 Bolling Stock.-There is no stock set^as^ ^ of this section.

(D) Projected new metalled road: Bujnurd-Asterabad. In March 1930, 4 Persian engineers were sent from Meshed to carry out survey work for a new metalled road which is to be built to connect Bujnurd with Asterabad. It is hoped to complete this new road during the summer of 1930. 3. Types of motor transport most commonly used in Khurasan in 1930. (a) Motor Lorries : Chevrolet (6 and 4 Cylinders). 1 Graham Page.

The following are the principal routes used by travellers to Russian territory from Meshed. (а) Meshed to Artih via Kuchan and Darreh Jaz. — A difficult pass between Kuchan and Muhammadabad, the Allha-ho-Akbar renders this practically a mule-track from Kmchan. (б) Meshed to Kaahka. —Much used by pilgrims. A mule track, in parts very difficult. (c) Meshed to Dushakh. —Easier than (b) and travers able by camels. Russian territory can be entered either via Chacha (Chehcheh), Qaratigan, or Haji Bolan. (d) Meshed to Sarakhs .—Fair weather road for light cars. In addition to the above a number of smugglers paths, passable with some difficulty by mules, exist. Note.— It is proposed, when funds are available, to construct a new metalled road from Imam Quli (North of Kuchan and between the latter and Bajgiran) and Muhammadabad. 5. Telegraphs. (i) The Indo-European Telegraph Department, which was previously in control of the Meshed-Duzdap and Meshed-Tehran lines, transferred these two lines to the Persian Government Telegraph Department in March 1928. The telegraph line connecting Duzdap with Seistan is, however, still maintained by the I. E. T. D. with its Headquarters in Tehran (March 1930). Until recently all the telegraph offices in the various districts of Khurasan were under Meshed, but a number of these have since been placed under the control of Tehran. The poles of the telegraph line from Duzdap to Meshed carry only one wire. They are mad ( e of wood throughoutthe whole length except from Duzdap to Hurmuk where they are made of 2 irons supported on concrete standing. (ii) Telegraph Offices: Under the control of Meshed :— Bajgiran. Kalat-i-Nadiri. Bujnurd. Khakistar. Birjand. Kuchan. Chinaran. Lutfabad. Isferain. Shirvan. Kariz. Under the control of Tehran :— Gunabad. Turbat-i-Haidari Nishapur. Duzdap, Sabzawar. Seistan Sarakhs. Khwash. (Hi) Telegraphic Personnel .—Generally speaking, the Persian telegraphic personnel are at present a long way from being efficient. Their knowledge of their telegraphic apparatus is purely superficial and very few of them are capable of carrying out even minor repairs to their instruments. There is one Senior Telegraphist for the whole Province, who is specially detailed to supervise the telegraphic apparatus, and one inspector of telegraph lines. The total number of trained telegraphic personnel in the whole of Khurasan is approximately 90. (iv) The Annual Budget for the Telegraph Department of Khurasan is Tomans 9,000 of which Tomans 5,000 are allotted to Meshed and remainder to the district telegraph offices. (v) The telegraph wire used throughout is No. 10 galvanised iron. 6. Telephones. In March 1930 there was only one long distance tele phone line in existence in Northern Khurasan, viz .:— Meshed-Kuchan-Bajgiran. At this time the construction of another line connecting Meshed with Sabzawar through Nishapur was under103 In Meshed City, besides the telephones of the military exchange, there are two private companies. The telephone service m Meshed is very unreliable. No. 12 telephone wire is used for long distance tele phones and No. 14 inside Meshed. 7.

The following diseases are prevalent: — Anthrax. Glanders. Jhooling. Mange. Surra. Tick fever (Sargin-i-Surkh). Eor particulars and methods of dealing with them, see Field Service Pocket Book, Part II, India, 1928; Animal Management, 1923 edition; and notes on Camel Manage ment. According to local camel men there is little risk of Surra between Lab-i-Baring and Neh and none at all from Shusp northwards, but cases have been k n °wn to occur at Qain and Jumin, particularly the latter. Ihe most dan gerous place. is the oasis watered by the Helmand delta and up to the river Rudbar. The Khurasani camel men and other camel-owing tribes round Seistan are well aware of the seasonal and regiona distribution of this disease. The most common biting flies connected with its spread are the Tabanidae and Stomoxys. The former have been found near watering places at Duzdap, Hurmuk, Bnjand Qain and Jumin. They make their first appearance m April and remain until the end of September. Stomoxys are found in all parts of East Persia but are more abundant in Seistan. TVm Surra season is from April to September, but the m id«e part of the” season ,s much less dangerous as the strong wind at that time disperses most of the rms, ing the fly season Tabanidae swarm m the vicinity of the Hamun, and Surra is very prevalent. mily report108 ^ feed Night blindness. shoe This is very common among horses and mules, due 6 sun glare. It can only be detected by testing the animal time at night, and this is best done by walking animals over 0 r s&lt; obstacles. Eye fringes should be used to protect the eyes whei from sun and flies. be f Poisonous plants. Jaur, probably the oleander, is found in the Kuh-i- Malusan and near Baluch Ab and other places in the hills. Poisoning from this plant is called “ Jauri ”. The symptoms of oleander poisoning are drowsiness, vomiting, and subsequently unconsciousness and death in eight hours to two days. Jak is a plant like “ padah ”, poplar willow, but its leaves are smaller. Treatment. —As for Colic. See Field Service Pocket Book, Part II, India, 1928 page 244, and Animal Manage ment. Fodder. Siah taghaz (disert tamarisk)— Taran Marung and Taramira (Mandao) are camel fodders. Taran is a plant that becomes green in the spring and has no flowers, it remains more or less green all the winter. Marung is said to be an evergreen plant with red flowers that grows in the bed of the Sar-i-Shilaq. Taramira is largely found north of Shusp. It is a most useful fodder for camels, either green, or as “ bhoosa ” made from the dry stalks. Meal made of the seeds, or the cake left after expressing the oil, is also a good camel food. It should be given in limited quantities (about 2 lbs. per day) and soaked in water for about 18 hours before feeding. Khasil (green wheat) is given to horses in the spring. Unlimited quantities cause diarrhoea which the natives regard as beneficial, but better effects are obtained from a more gradual introduction of Khasil into the ration. Wheat bhoosa is the main fodder at other times of the year, and may always be used with advantage for horses and camels in the same way as chaff. Owing to the mode of preparation it contains much dirt and requires careful screening before use.109 When camels have been starving and are allowed: to feed greedily on green fodder, flatulent colic results and should be treated as mentioned under Poisonous Plants. Grain .—Barley is the universal grain. Wheat is some times given. The Persians usually feed grain uncrushed, or soaked. Owing to fermentation colic frequently results when the latter method is used. Barley and wheat should be fed crushed whenever possible and mixed with bhoosa. As new barley is injurious to horses and mules, and frequently produces fatal digestive troubles or laminitis, it .should not be used until at least a month after threshing. Cotton seed is given to camels in the cold weather. £ MlliV REPORTIIIIIMMIM s</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000239.0x00012d_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/MIL/17/15/7</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000239.0x00012d</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/MIL/17/15/7</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘Military report on Persia Volume I 1930’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1920/1931</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-09-20T18:06:51</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (73 folios)</extent><extent>A contents page at the front of the volume (f 6) and index at the rear (ff 64-66) both reference the volume’s original printed pagination.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 75; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.Pagination: the file also contains an original printed pagination sequence.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Military report on the Khurasan [Khurāsān] and Seistan [Sīstān] regions of Persia [Iran], with maps and illustrations.
