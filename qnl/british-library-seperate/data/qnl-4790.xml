Similar circulars were sent in 1946 and 1947 to observe Remembrance Day on 10 and 9 November respectively. These were all circulated to the Political Agencies in the Gulf. Each circular contains a list of people/corporate bodies to be circulated to. These include; the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, the Mukhi of the Hindu community, and The Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO). The circulars include certain procedures to take place on the day, namely that there should be complete suspension of all normal business throughout the British Empire and in all British Government Offices during the Two Minutes’ Silence commencing at 11 am. At 11 am the Agency flag will be dipped to half-mast and raised again at 11.02 as a sign that the Two Minutes’ Silence is over. From 1938 onwards poppies were sold on Armistice Day and later on Remembrance Day.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Remembrance day (UK)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000197#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
