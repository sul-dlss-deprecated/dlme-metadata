Dated dhiras, 5tli December, 1914. . oir:- I have the honour to approach you with a suggestion with regard to the question oX my making some tours in my consular district during the year 1914-15. As Your Excellency is aware I have at different times during the course of the last two years submitted to you requests to be allowed to make short tours in my District, but it has sometimes happened that owing to unforeseen occur rences these particular tours, even when sanctioned, nave been rendered impracticable or undesirable. Xhe fact is that the best moment for the Consul to leave ohiraz cannot always be calculated with exactitude beforehand, and opportunities for touring must be taken advantage of from time to time as they occur. I venture, therefore, now to submit a general proposal for next year's tours to Your Excellency, so that you may have time to consider it beforehand, and, if you approve, to apply for the necessary sanction to the Foreign office. t , &lt; D- I would propose then to make two tours, one in the spring on somewhat the same lines as that proposed in my despatch ho.4 dated 7th February last, and approved and sanctioned by Your Excellency find the Foreign office; and another in the autumn in a South Easterly direction towards Kavar, Pasa, Jahrum, and other districts lying in that part of Fare. I cannot make an exact estimate of tiie lis Britannic Lajesty's Minister, Tehran.the cost ol these two journeys, but would reckon the total expenditure at about £2QO. I would suggest, there fore, that a general sanction should now be applied for to my making two tours as proposed (or possibly if more suitable and convenient a larger number of shorter tours) during the course of the next financial year, and that a sum of ,2200 should be sanctioned to meet the necessary expenses. If this suggestion were approved I should be in a position to make plans, arrangements, and enquiries in advance, and could submit definite proposals to Your Excellency by telegram from time to time as the occasion seemed favourable. Detailed accounts of expenditure would of course be submitted after each journey. If tnis suggestion is approved I propose again to approach the Government of India (through the Resident at Bushire) for permission to take with me a British officer, or a trained Indian, to survey the country through which we may pass. The Indian Government, I may mention, had actually detailed an officer to accompany me on my proposed journey last spring, but as Your Excellency is aware, that journey had to be abandoned owing to the troubles at Kazerun.

I have the honour to inform you that in accordance with the permission which I received from Your Excellency I left Shiraz on the 21st January on a short tour, I proceeded first to the district of Ifavar which lies to the SoE« of Shiraz at a distance of some 36 miles, and spent two days there, returning to Shiraz up the valley of the Kara Aghach river via the village of Daringun, and so to Deh Sheikh and Chinar Rahdar* The, most interesting feature of this short trip was the examination of the remarkable dam (known as the ”band-i- Bahman') which spans the Kara Aghach river in the defile before it emerges into the Kavar plain. This dam is said to be of great antiquity, and is very well and solidly construct ed. I estimate its dimensions at some 70 yards long, 20 feet high, and 15 feet thick at the top (I enclose a photograph which gives a general idea of the whole dam) &lt;&gt; This dam in times past secured the irrigation of the major portion of the large and fertile Kavar plain, but it has of recent years fallen much into disrepair, and of the two water-channels which should convey water to the plain, only one is in operation (and that not to its fullest extent) and the other is entirely broken down# The furthest cascade visible in the enclosed photograph shows where the water which should run along this latter canal escapes back into the main stream. A comparatively small sum would suffice to restore this dam and the two water-channels to their original state of efficiency and would thus secure the irrigation of several thousands of acres in the Kavar plain. I am merely bringing these facts to Your Excellences notice as an example of Tfrhafc Fars ^ HoBoM. Minister, i M'm — Tehran, , i, \ No 2l,M, dated 12 MAR 1914a little engineering talent and 'by the expenditure of comparatively small sums of money : and there are, as I happen to Ionov/, other similar instances elsewhere in the province where the services of an expert engineer could he utilised to great advantage. With regard to this and other similar matters I am inbonstant consultation with the Governor General and the Finance Agent, and it is to he hoped that some useful work in such directions may he accomplished during the next few years. The remainder of my trip was uneventful and although the country through which I was passing was only a few years ago one of the most notoriously dangerous districts in Fars, and is one which has suffered most severely from the ravages of thfc Kashkais, Surkhis, and other rohhers, I found that a condition of profound cairn prevailed, and that the general tranquillity which has now supervened in Fars has extended to these districts also. I made a number of observations on minor points (such as the necessity for local tufangchis, the possibility of minor irrigation works and so on) which I am duly bringing to the attention of the local authorities. AS my trip was projected originally simply as a shooting excursion I have made no application for the payment of my expenses by Government, but I trust that Your Excellency will not consider that the time spent on such expeditions is wasted, as I think that a careful observer will often be able to bring back with him information of interest and value : and I think that the mere fact of a British Consul coming in these more out of the way districts is calculated to produce a good effect, and to emphasise the fact that order is being gradually restored in the province, and that the representative of Great Britain is manifesting a personal interest in the improved state of affairs. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for information.

Sir:- I have the honour to forward to you, herewith, copy of a report by Major Steel, Military Attache to His Majesty's Legation, on some visits which he has recently paid to the Headquarters and Schools of the Government Gendarmerie in Tehran. I venture to call your attention to the interesting nature of the information recorded in this report about a service upon the efficiency of which the future of Persia depends to such a large extent. I have, &amp;c. # (Signed) Walter Townley Right Honourable Sir E. Grey, Bart., K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.GOVEENMENT GENDARMERIE, Report on visits to Headquarters of 1st and 2nd Regiments and Officers anc Non-Commissioned Officers Schools. During the past week, with General Hjalmarson , s permission, I visited the Headquarters of the 1st Regi ment at Yusufabad, that of the 2nd at Baghi Shah, and the Officers and Non-commissioned Officers Schools in the city. 1. Acirlnlstratj.^n . Regimental Headquarters consist merely of the establishment necessary for the training of recruits, together with sufficient numbers to furnish the various guards on Legations, public offices &amp;c. in Tehran. The remainder of the men are employed on the various reads guarded by the Gendarmerie which besides the local roads in the neighbourhood of Tehran, include in the case of the 1st Regiment, half of the road to Kasvin, and in the case of the 2nd, the Isfahan road as far as Passangan, and that to Sultanabad* Regimental Headquarters are accordingly known as the Regimental 'schools'. Owing to the haste with which the organizations have had to he brought into being% teing^ and the reeponeihilities of the Gendarmerie on the roads, the 'schools” suffer from the grave dis advantage at present of having practically no trained Persian Officers or Non-commissioned Officers as those of any value are employed on the roads. This disadvantage will he considerably lessened when the present course of Officers and Non-commissioned Of ficers has completed its training, and will disappear altogether if the present excellent system of training at the central schools is enabled to continue as it has begun. General Hjalmarson has endeavoured as far as possible in his distribution of Swedish Officers to ensure that there should be a capable senior Officer with full administrative responsibility at the head of each regiment, assisted by a second in command who is responsible for training, with an assistant for each of the mounted and dismounted services. Intendance and medical services are very efficiently organised, the former under Persian Officers who originally served with the Persian Army, and the latter, by Persian medical Officers who have had 6 to 8 years experience inin Europe Existing buildings, with only such modifications as are at present absolutely necessary, have been utilized as barracks and stables, and the whole appear to be efficiently and economically run, anc while by no means luxurious, the arrangements are such as to ensure the contentment and health of the men* The men are housed by sections of 12 to 20, and sleep on the floors, the bedding being neatly packed away during the daytime* The arms of each section are under the charge of a Non-commissioned Officer in lock ed arm racks. The men all mess together In a large dining hall at tables in more or less European fashion. Kitchens and bakeries are clean and well run, and food arrangements, according to the Swedish Officers, are, as in the case of Indian troops, very simple and give them no trouble* Both regimental headquarters and the central schools have very good, clean- and up to date dispensary and hospital arrangements. I noticed a bath house at the barracks of the 1st Regiment where each man can get a hot bath once a week, and coffee stalls in each barracks, details which go to show that without incurring% incurring great expense, the Swedish Officers are very thorough in considering the well-being of the men. There are tailors, bootmakers and saddle shops at each barracks where repairs are dene cheaply and well. Each regiment keeps up a store of unilcim and equipment. Such articles as are not locally procurable appear to be mostly obtained from Germany and Russia such as blankets, cloth, and leather for boots which latter are now being made up locally. 2. Personnel and recruiting . Recruits for the let Regiment are net obtained from the neighbourhood of Tehran, but are mostly Kurds, Tunes from Azerbaijan, a few men from near Kasvin and a few Bakhtiaris. The 2nd Regiment recruits from districts south of Tehran including Veramin. Neither regiment takes any men from the towns. There is no standard of height, but a careful medical examination is carried out. The men are short, averag ing about 5*4', but are generally thickset and sturdy and give the impression of being good material. There is no difficulty in obtaining recruits. A new system is being tried, and appears to be answering well, by whichwhich in seme cases the men bring their own ponies. Several head men have produced batches of recruits under these conditions. Men bringing their own horses receive 1 toman per mensem, in addition to the usual pay of Si- tomans, for the hire of their horses. Men of different classes are mixed indiscriminately and are liable for service throughout Persia. They agree to serve for three years. The men seen were mostly recruits with at most 4 months service, and for this reason did not perhaps give the impression of being very quick and active on their legs, but all accounts agree as to the general power of great endurance displayed by the men. The great majority have no education at all, bub they appear to be rather more intelligent than the average Indian Army recruit. 5. Uniform, arms and equipment . The uniform consists of a blue tunic for winter and garrison duties with a sheep- skin waistcoat for winter and duty on the roads, thin blue (cotton) trousers v/ith khaki putties. In the summer the men wear a Khaki blouse, and in the winter &amp; thicK blue cloth grea-t coat for all duties including drill. The latter is the hast and most serviceable articlearticle of clothing they have and is much appreciated. A hlacK leather waisthelt with two pouches and a large piece of leather to protect the uniform from the car bine which is slung over the back, is worn over the great coat. No pack is carried, but I saw a large haversack and an efficient tin water-bottle in the stores. A white lambskin cap is worn for garrison duties in the winter and there is a brown lambskin cap for service. I saw a number of brown felt helmets for summer use in the stores. These are made locally^» They do not seem a very suitable head-gear and have been strongly objected to by the mullahs and in consequence by some of the men. Both the mounted and dismounted branches are armed V with a light German Mauser carbine (1891), calibre 8 millimetres. It is a very handy weapon and is sighted up to 1200 metres. This carbine is worn slung over the back, and is secured to the belt with a short strap. The cost of these carbines was about 16 shillings apiece and they appear to be good value as they were new and unused. The arms are very well kept. I was told that no side arm is considered necessary as the enemy never comecome to close quarters in Persia, but a few Swedish swords have been imported and are now in use by the Officers and Non-commissioned Officers at the central school. These swords are much too heavy and long. 80 rounds are carried on the man when on service, with reserves in boxes on mules as required. The saddle for mounted gendarmes is a very poor affair, but lack of funds prevents them from getting a better pattern at present. It has been copied from the saddle of the Central India Horse at Shiraz, and is made up locally and only costs 8 tomans or about £1.12-. The bridles are plain Pelhams with a leather lipstrap instead of a chain as the latter are not locally procurable. 4. Training . Owing to the ever increasing road responsi bilities of the Gendarmerie, it is impossible to give the men mere than about 4 months training before sending them out. Considering the difficulties that the Swedish Officers have to contend with owing to the lack of efficient instructors, the results that they achieve are on the whole most satisfactory. I saw both drill and practice in attack formation with the 1st1st Regiment. The former was fairly steady and accur ate, though the men were hut 4 months enlisted at the most. In the latter they took good advantage of cover when obtainable, but of course fire discipline was not very good. It is very difficult to get the men to understand the adjustment of sights and to carry this out quickly, and the M officer aspirants” who in de fault of Officers and Non-commissioned Officers were in charge of sections were quite inefficient. This however will, it is hoped, soon be remedied. The drill of the mounted gendarmes of the 2nd Regimeht was quite good. Major Lewenhaupt, who is in charge of them together with the maxim detachment of that regiment, impressed me as being a very capable and energetic officer. The mounted drill is restricted to the simplest movements, and aims at no cavalry tactics but at getting fire to bear as quickiy and efficiently as possible. The men were quick at dismounting and mounting and the ponies though all entires stood quite quietly. Drill in extended crdOa. is carefully practised, as the Swedisn Officers have found by experience that it is very important in order toto rapidly get to close quarters with the tribesmen. The ponies are not trained at all, but are very steady in the ranks and quiet. They average about Id.o, and are very suitable mounts, hardy, and in most cases up to fair weight. The majority of the ponies have osen bought in Tehran and the neighbourhood and cost about £12 apiece. The firs discipline of Major Lewenhaupt’s mounted gendames was very fair, orders being given and passed well. He however has had the advantage oi hav ing a very good Persian Officer to assist nim. fi. Machine Pun Detachment, The four machine guns at pre sent with the 2nd regiment are organized into a battery and are commanded by an apparently very efficient Persian Officer who was formerly Chief of the General Staff of the Persian Array. The guns are Maxims, 8 I millimetres calibre, and were obtained complete with tripod mountings, shields and saddlery from Germany. The ammunition has the pointed bullet. The detachment is mounted, the guns and ammunition being carried on good stout mules. 4500 rounds per gun is carriec, 6 boxes of 250 together with a spare parts bcx forming a mule load. The men seemed well 'trained and took agun to pieces and reassembled it with ease and pre cision. The very best men have been chosen for service with the machine guns.. Guns were brought into action quickly and quietly. This detachment, with a section of mountain guns which is now being organized, will form a very valuable part of the proposed mobile force which is to have its headquarters at Tehran. It may be mentioned here that the Gendarmerie have now in all 12 maxims, the above 4 with the 2nd Regiment, 2 at the Officers School and Non-commissioned Officers School, 4 with the 3rd Regiment at Shiraz and 2 with the 4th Regiment at Kerman. 6. The Officers School. The Officers School is situated in the Atabeg Park in the North .of the city. The building is very suitable, and there are good living rooms for the 40 officer students, class rooms and a particularly good and well-fitted gymnasium. Officers are to be trained here for general service in any quarter of Persia. They are selected from good f am ilies, and must usually be between 18 and 25 years of age. The present course began in September last and will last for a year. Before going to the Officers school. Officers have to serveserve for 5 months in the ranks at the 'school” of the regiment. They then do 6 months on the roads and go to the school if found satisfactory in every way. The course comprises gymnastics, fencing, simple tactical lessons illustrated on the map and on the ground, geography, mathematics and practical drill, manoeuvre, stable duties &amp;c. and all matters connected with the interior economy and administration of the gendarmerie. The students are kept well employed, the average number of hours work per day being 8. I saw the class at work in the gymnasium, and was very much struck by the smart, alert appearance of the students, which contrasts in the most marked manner with the demeanour of Persians elsewhere. It is quite evident that much as has been already accomplished by the gendarmerie, there will he a yet more striking advance when the influence of this first batch of thoroughly trained Officers has time to he felt. 7. Non-Commissioned Officers School . The Non-commissioned Officers school has been established in an old caravan serai in the Eastern quarter of the city where the build ings have been well and economically adapted for 150 toto 160 men and 200 horses. The arrangements are similar to, hut if anything better than those already described as obtaining at the two regimental head quarters, and the cleanliness and efficiency of these arrangements leaves nothing to be desired. The course for Non-commissioned Officers lasts 6 months. They are picked men who have already seen service on the roads. At present besides fulfilling the requirements of the two Tehran Regiments, the school is training the Non-commissioned Officers for the Kasvin and Isfahan regiments which are now in course of formation. In future however each regimental headquarters outside Tehran will have its own Non-commissioned Officers school. One has already been established at Shiraz and one is being prepared at Kerman. The training of the Non-commissioned Officers is identical whether they eventually join the mounted or dismounted branch as it is essential that Non-commissioned Officers in charge of posts should know something of mounted work, one or two mounted men being always with a post. The Officers and Non-commissioned Officers from both schools combined in the afternnon, and I was able to see themthem drilling as two squadrons of about ICO each. This drill, which comprised a good deal of extended order and dismounted work was the best that I saw during my visits to the gendarmerie and considering that they have only drilled together for 3 months it reflected great credit on Major Borell, Captain Nystroem and Captain Soneseofi who are the instructors at the schools. 8. Conclusion. In conclusion of this report I would wish to record my opinion that without very hard and conscien tious work, the results that have been achieved could not have been possible. The Swedish Officers have, in the face of great difficulties, laid the foundations of a very efficient force, but they are only foundations. Given reasonable time and continuity of policy, every thing points to the permanent establishment of a nation al force with new traditions of efficiency end honesty. The obvious necessity at the present moment is an in crease in the staff of Instructors to cope with the growing responsibilities of the Gendarmerie throughout Persia.

No. 45, dated Shiraz, the 6th December 1913 (Confidential). From— Major W. F. T. O'Connor, His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To—His Excellency Sir Walter Townley, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., His Britannic Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, Tehran. I have the honour to submit herewith a report on my recent journey to Kumarij and back, and on the operations of the gendarmerie in so far as I was able to witness and to judge of them.t 175 As already reported, I left Shiraz on the 9th November and accompanied Major Uggla to Dashtarjin, at which place we halted until the gendarmarie column arrived there, on the 11th. On the following day the column resumed its march towards Kazerun. I inspected the troops with Major Uggla before they marched off, and found them looking well and cheerful, neatly turned out, and apparently well-disciplined. On the road out I took the opportunity of examining the block-houses which have been constructed by the gendarmerie at various places. I attach a detailed list of these for Your Excellency’s information. They appear to have been well and solidly constructed, and should prove a strong deterrent to robbers and raiding parties. The column arrived at Kazerun on the 13th, and halted the following day* On the morning of the 15th a force of all arms, about 600 to 700 strong, with its five Swedish officers (Majors Uggla and Lundberg, and Captains Killander Pousette and Lundberg), marched out towards Shapur district, which lies to the north of the Bushire road extending from about the village of Debris to the Bahdar Caravanserai, and hounded by the hills about five or six miles to the north. I had on the previous day discussed with Major Uggla his plans for the occupation of this district, and refrained from accompanying the column us I feared that my presence might only embarrass the Swedish officers in their negotiations with Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashkuli, and the brigand Ali Muhammad. As far as concerned Muhammad Ali Khan no difficulty was experienced. Major Uggla sent an advance guard cf cavalry to cut off his retreat in case he meditated any treachery, and himself proceeded directly to his fort of Eateh- abad. Here he was courteously received by Muhammad Ali Khan, who appeared to be in a wholesome state of apprehension, and who agreed to quit the district with all his men, on the 17th, leaving only (by arrangement with Major Uggla) some 30 tufangchis to act as joint guards to various towers together with the gendarmerie. Whilst these negotiations were in progress Captain Pousette had advanced with a few men to the Tul-i-Kuhak fort (these various places will be found marked on sheet No. 10.0 of the degree sheets published by the Survev Department of India), occupied by Ali Muhammad and his band, and called upon him to surrender. On his refusing to do so, a force of all arms advanced against the fort, and at 2 p.m. began the attack upon it. These operations lasted until sunset and were continued during the night. As far as I could gather from the accounts of the Swedish officers, the attack was w 7 ell pressed forward, the two small 7 centimetre mountain guns advancing eventually to within 50 to 100 yards of the walls of the fort, and the gendarmes in general behaving very well and courageously. The brigands (estimated at about 50 in number) kept themseives well hidden, and maintained a brisk and accurate fire on the attackers. The fort itself, which I examined myself the next morning, is an exceed ingly strong one, standing on a small rise, built of solid stone, and with two tiers of fire. After nightfall (according to the accounts of the Swedish officers on the spot) the troops entirely surrounded the fort, and a storming party was held in readiness to rush in as soon as a breach was effected. But just after midnight it was found that the fort had been quietly evacuated, and when the gendarmes rushed in there was no one there. It is impossible to understand how, except through gross negligence on the part of the attackers, or the connivance of some of the gendarmes, the brigands effected their escape. It was a bright moonlight night, and a dog would have been plainly visible at 100 yards. The ground immediately surrounding the fort is open. There were four Swedish officers on the spot, and a sufficient force of gendarmes to surround the place entirely. With ordinary vigilance and care not a man should have escaped alive. And yet Ali Muhammad, 50 men, 5 women, and some donkeys laden with ammuni'ion, &amp;c., succeeded in getting away without anyone seeing them, or knowing in which direction they had gone. It was a most deplorable blunder, and has been the direct cause of ail the subsequent troubles at and near Kazerun.On the morning of the 16th, I visited the Tul-i-Kuhak fort, and then rode on to Kumarij where the gendarmerie column arrived during the afternoon. They halted here on the 17th, whilst Major Uggla and his officers conducted a reconnaissance of the country as far as Konar Takhteh. At this place he - met the Kalantar and the Agent of the Shaikh of Mohammerah, and explained to them his conditions regarding the taking over of the road : that is to say, firstly, the immediate cessation of rahdari; secondly, the surrender to the gendarmerie of all towers and caravanserais; and thirdly, the payment to the Khan of the allowances already arranged by the Governor-General. Major Uggla returned with the impression that these terms would be accepted, but that it would not be advisable to insist upon the immediate surrender of all towers. These anticipations were fulfilled, and the gendarmerie occupied the Konar Takhteh plain the next day without any fighting, leaving one or two towers in the possession of the local tufangchis. I myself returned to Kazerun on the 18th, as it seemed unnecessary for me to accompany the gendarmerie any further. All was quiet at Kazerun when I passed through that place, although a certain anxiety existed as regards the whereabouts and future movements of Ali Muhammad and his band ; but the situation was on the whole satisfactory, and in every respect favourable to the gendarmerie. It was, therefore, with the greatest astonishment that I learnt, on my arrival at Shiraz on the 22nd, of the event which had just taken place at * Sec enclosures to Serial Nos. 149,152 and 153, Knzerun, regarding which I have sub* ante. mitted full telegraphic reports* to Youf Excellency. As mentioned in those reports I attribute these recent unfortunate occurrences, firstly, to the escape of Ali Muhammad, and secondly, to the misconduct of the Persian gendarme officer and his men at Kazerun. This man seems to have behaved in a most injudicious and highhanded manner after the departure of the main column, disarming harmless villagers, and permit ing looting and other abuses in the Shapur and neighbouring villages. I have already had occasion to bring to Major Uggla’s notice cases of misconduct on the part of the gendarme officers and non-Commissioned Officers in charge of posts on the road, and have urged upon him the necessity for the Swedish officers exercising a more constant and vigilant control over their Persian subordinates. I regret to have to say that in spite of the orders issued by Major Uggla (who is, I am convinced, sincerely anxious to put a stop to all irregularities) many abuses still continue, and I am the recipient of numerous complaints from muleteers and others. This st c ate of affairs arises, I think, chiefly from the inexperience of the Swedish officers in dealing with orientals and from the disinclination of some of the younger officers to hear any complaints against ^heir men; and it will no doubt be rectified iu course of time. A copy of this despatch is being fomarded to the Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the Eoreign Department and to the PoliticalKesident in the Persian Gulf. Enclosure JSo. 2. .

It is that if the gendarmerie are allowed to collect dues under any name, it will be difficult for their European officers to restrain them from abusing their functions as collectors and extorting more than the authorised charges, at least in outlying posts. The danger is one which would at once occur to anyone who has been associated with Militia or Police on the North- West Frontier of India, but Major Lundberg mav not have thought of it, and he might regard the mere suggestion of its possibility as an imputation on the character of the force under his command. {Enclosure No. 1.) No. 3, dated Bushire, the 18th December 1913. From— Majoe H. Lundbero, Gendarmerie Gouvernementale De Perse, Regiment, To—The British Resident and General Consul in Bushire. Herewith I beg to call your attention to the need of keeping the caravan serais clean along the Shiraz road. One of them, Mian Kotal, was so dirty that the European travellers only with the greatest unwillingness could pass a night there. The chief of the gendarmerie post got orders to have it cleaned by the charvadars. Thereby was a veritable Augias-stable cleansed. A manure heap, which covered the garden at a depth of two yards, was taken away and burnt down. The charvadars made however complaints about this matter, asserting that their caravans would be delayed, if they must occupy themselves with cleaning the caravanserai. And the charvadars are perhaps in the right not to be delayed. The gendarmes are prejudiced against any work beyond their proper service. We cannot, without great inconveniences, put them to clean the caravanserais. I therefore beg you to reflect upon the proposal, which however is not descending from me, that every charvadar must pay one shahi (1/20 kran) a mule at the quarters for the night. This money would be collected by the Gendarmerie-post-chief. It will be his duty to pay hamals (porters) and keep donkeys for the cleaning.(Enclosure No. 2.) Dated the 31st December 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—-C aptain Lundbeeg, Bushire. Please see Major Lundberg’s letter* of 18th December in connection J with caravanserais on the Buslnre-Shiraz • Enclosure No. i, ante. road, suggesting that a tax be levied on muleteers for the use of them. While I entirely agree with you as to the desirability of caravanserais bein- kept clean, I much fear that anything in the shape of a tax on muleteers for such a purpose would be open to several objections. Firstly I understand that some, if not all, of the caravanserais are Waaf are Pious foundations devoted to the use of pilgrims, travellers, muleteers, &amp;c. free of all payment. To tax the animals of those who enter the caravan serais wnuld probably, therefore, violate the conditions of^ the Waqt. Resentment would most likely be aroused and find vent in complaints against the gendarmerie, whose popularity might suiter. Secondly.— One of the main aims of the gendarmerie being the removal of irregular imposts on transport, I should much doubt the advisability of the gendarmerie connecting themselves with a scheme which in any way savoured of a tax on the means of carriage. Muleteers w ould be certain to use the levy of a tax as proposed by you, as an excuse for demanding higher rates from merchants and the circle of discontent would thus be widened. Thirdly —Other difficulties occur to my mind, such as the effect of fluctuations in traffic, which at the rate suggested might yield at one time too much, at another time not enough money to keep the posts clean; but I need not mention these as they are less important than the points w'hich I have already raised. I would suggest therefore that, in the first instance, you should apply to the managers of the various Waqfs, some of whom are believed to reside in Shiraz, for funds to be provided now r and regularly for cleaning the caravan serais.’Railing this, I think that, in the interests of the gendarmerie themselves, it would be best to provide the money needed out of gendarmerie funds. 159 No. 20, dated Bushire, the 4th (received 12th) January 1914 (Confidential).

On 18th December, Major Lundberg of the gendarmerie, then on a visit to Bushire, wrote* to me enquiring my • EncisoureNa. i to Serial No. 158. views as to the levy by gendarmerie of a charge of one shahi per caravan mule at each caravanserai occupied by gendarmerie on the Shiraz road to meet expenses of keeping^ it clean. After enquiry I have repliedf to Captain t Enclosure No. 2 , ibid. Lundberg, only gendarmerie officer now here, saying that, while I sympathise with the object of the levy, I see various objections to it in practice especially:— Firstly .—That some, if not all, caravanserais are pious foundations for use of public free of charge and to alter the gratis character of the accommodation would probably lead to complaints against gendarmerie and make them unpopular. Secondly .—That levy proposed would be an unrecognised due on transit, such as it is one of the main functions of the gendarmerie to abolish, and would cause discontent among merchants against whom muleteers would certainly raise rates. I mentioned also other minor objections. I have suggested in reply that gendarmerie should first approach managers of caravanserais and try to induce them to provide funds, and, tailing in this, should defray cost of cleaning from gendarmerie funds. Greatest objection to my mind, which, however, I did not include in my letter is that, if gendarmerie are allowed to collect dues at all, there will certainly be extortion at least at outlying posts removed from European eupervision. I trust, therefore, that Your Excellency will sustain my objec- tions as scheme seems to lead direct to serious abuses and is m fact inconsistent with both spirit and letter of arrangements abolishing rahdan and similar imposts. Meanwhile I learn that, system has been actually enforced at various posts, and it is stated that at one post three and even five shabis per mule are being recovered instead of one shahi.

My recent journey down road has shown me that much ill-feeling exists against gendarmerie owing to their highhanded methods, and to abuses perpetrated by individual Persian officers in charge of posts. I have been aware for some time past that such abuses were being prac ticed and there made repeated strong representations to Major Uggla on the subject. Uggla has issued orders that all such malpractices should disconti nue, but his instructions appear to have been systematically ignored. I am inclined to believe that in this matter he was not very loyally supported by officers here who are resenting intrusion of their men, especially when emanating from British sources. They have in fact allowed themselves to be hoodwinked by their Persian subordinates with inevitable result that many of the latter abuse authority. I had already written long ago detailed report to Uggla to this effect before recent occurrences at Kazerun impressing on him necessity for more strict and constant supervision on the part of Swedish officers and recounting abuses which at present exist.

You should inform His Excellency that I much appreciate readiness with which he has come to assistance of gendarmerie on this occasion, although I do not apprehend that incident will prove more than one of those inevitable small set-backs that must be expected.

Daliki had apparently resigned himself to this, and, as regards Ahmadi, the Governor of Bushire, at IJggla’s request, wrote advising Khan to accept position. I doubt if they will sit down to differential treatment of Borasjun. Captain Poussette coming to Bushire with one gendarme to arrange for supplies was shot at between Ahmadi and Bushire, but no damage done, and Ugo'la has reason to think the offenders were Tangistanis, and attaches no significance to incident.

In continuation of the various telegrams* which I have despatched to you . 0 v 0 • , xt on the subject of the Sowiet-ed-Dowieh, * See enclosure ISo. 4 to Serial No. 128. , I beg to submit herewith a more detailed account of his proceedings and character, together with some general remarks on the subject of the Ilkhaniship of the Kashgai tribes. As already remarked, the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh has never been an entirely satisfactory Ilkhani. Apart from his various adventures and short comings in the past, his attitude towards the present Governor-General has been characterised by unceasing suspicion and lack of candour. One of the Mukhbir-es-Saltaneh's first administrative acts on taking charge of the province was to reappoint the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh as Ilkhani of the Kashgais, and he has ever since endeavoured to maintain friendly relations with him, and to inspire him with confidence. It is quite comprehensible that the Sowlet-ed- Dowleh should entertain a deep distrust of all Persian officials and their ways : but this is carried to an absurd extent when the likhani, even when guaranteed his personal safety by the British Consul and the Belgian Finance Agent, r efuse8 to come into Shiraz to meet the Governor-General in a friendly con ference. But if the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh were a really strong and capable Ilkhani, who could keep the tribes in proper order and control the various Kalantars and the members of his own family, such an attitude towards his own government and its representative in Pars might well be condoned and accepted as the relics of an old-fashioned system whose utility is fast disappearing. But it is unfortunately the case that the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh is nowadays a far from independent governor of the Kashgais. Little real power remains to him, and he maintains his position chiefly by means of intrigues amongst the different parties of the various sub-tribes, and by backing the Kalantars one against the other. Besides this, the feuds and jealousies of the four brothers (or half-brothers) who represent the reigning family are a perpetual source of trouble and uncer tainty, and even if they should desire to live amicably with one another, they are prevented from doing so by the intrigues of interested parties amongst the leading men of the tribe who, for their own ends, are perpetually scheming to replace one brother by another and to create quarrels among them. The recent history of the Kashgais illustrates this state of affairs very clearly, and the situation has been graphically described in the despatches written by Mr. Smart to Your Excellency last year. In addition to these various sources of friction and instability (which are inherent in the very nature of the present system rather than due to the defects of any particular Ilkhani), it must be admitted that the general •character and record of the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh himself are not such as to inspire much confidence either in his ability, honesty, loyalty, or good-will. He has made a practice for years past of surrounding himself with a chosen band of cut-throats and brigands, whose special abilities he does not hesitate to use to further his own ends and intrigues : and amongst these gentry are numbered several really influential men (such for example as Shahbaz, a chief of the Surkhis, &amp;c.) who can, if so required, make themselves regular thorns in the rside of the government, and can keep whole tracts of country in a state of disturbance. It is a well-known fact that the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh has frequently so employed these rascals in the past when it suited him to do so, either to discredit a rival or opponent, or merely to cause embarrassment to the Gov ernor-General, and there is no reason to suppose that he would have the smallest scruple in acting again in a similar manner in the future. Other grounds of complaint against the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh are too numerous to enumerate fully. Amongst the principal may be noted the fact that he has at different times confiscated large properties to which he has no shadow of a claim, and of which he remains in illegal possession. That on one occasion he seized a wealthy Persian land-owner (who by the way possessed a certificate of British nationality at the time), and kept him for many months in prison with the object of compelling him to surrender a portion of his property. And there are innumerable robberies and other offences w T hich have been committed by his tribesmen for which no punishment has been awarded and no com pensation paid. But in spite of all his faults and failings it must still be admitted that the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh is by far the most capable member of his family, and the only one who can make even a pretence of controlling the Kashgais; and if the old regime were to continue indefinitely in Pars, it would perhaps be necessary, or at any rate expedient, that he should continue as Ilkhani. But times are changing even in Pars, and with the restoration of order, due to the gendarmerie, and the improvements in the administration generally which are now being gradually effected, the old haphazard methods of governing the Kashgais have become an anachronism, and are inconsistent with progress and with the new necessities of the situation. Nowadays, with the establishment of the gendarmerie and other European institutions, the Governor-General of the province himself has to submit to a certain measure of European control, and to shape his conduct and policy in accordance with modern ideas; and as time goes on there is little doubt that the extent of this foreign control will develope, and the administration of the province in general will assume a more regular and settled shape. The principal obstacle to such progress at the present moment is the existence of the Nomad tribes—the Khamseh and the Kashgai. The question of the former I do not propose to discuss now. It is sufficient to note that the Kawam-ul-Mulk is the hereditary Ilkhani of these tribes, and that the problem with regard to him is of another character al together from that affecting the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. But as regards the Kashgais, it is clearly anomalous and undesirable that, whilst the administra tion of the province of Pars is acquiring a more settled aspect, and when the Governor-General is being forced to submit to a system of modified European control, the Ilkhaniship of one of the great Nomad groups should be vested in a semi-independent, hereditary chief, whose ideas are of an entirely medieval nature, and who cannot be coaxed into approaching nearer to the capital of the province than within a distance of several farsahhs. In a word the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, like a good many other institutions in Ears, is a relic of an old-fashioned regime^ and as his general character and up-bringing seem to render him incapable of adopting himself to modern ideas and requirements, he must sooner or later disappear and be replaced by some substitute more satisfactory and more amenable. I have discussed this question on several occasions with the Governor- General, and our opinions are, generally speaking, the same. He also is con vinced that the present system of Ilkhaniship is antiquated and unworkable, and must eventually make way for something better; and as it is clear that no other member of the ruling family would or could do any better than the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh himself, the inevitable conclusion is that the whole principle of an hereditary Ilkhani must be abolished, and the control of the tribes must be vested in an independent government nominee, subordinate to the Governor-General of Pars on the one hand, and controlling the Kashgais through the medium of the different sub-tribal Kalantars on the othei. If this conclusion is accepted as correct, the question arises as to whether any outside governor will have sufficient influence and prestige to keep the104 . tribes in order. Opinions may, no doubt, vary on this point, but I venture to express my personal belief that no great difficulty would be found in effecting the desired change, or in maintaining the authority of the new Ilkhani. As already remarked above, the present hereditary Ilkhanis maintain their position and some show of authority rather by diplomacy and intrigue, and by the judicious balancing of one set of Kalantars against another, than by any inherent prestige due to their family influence or traditions. Whichever of the brothers is in power, there is always a section of the tribes which is opposed to him, and which is ready to intrigue, and if necessary to fight, against him. When conversing with some of the discontented Kalantars at Shiraz a short time ago, I asked them point-blank whom they wanted as Ilkhani. They replied that they did not really care very much who it was so long as they were freed from the oppression of the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh; and they declared themselves perfectly ready to accept and obey any Ilkhani nominated by the Persian Government from outside the tribe altogether. And I imagine that a similar reply would at any time be given by some sections of the tribe whichever of the present Ilkhani family happened to be in power for the time being. But apart from the sentiments of the Kalantars and of the tribesmen them selves in the matter, the fact that the Persian Government now possesses a regular force in Ears in the shape of the gendarmerie (and it is to be hoped will soon possess another small but efficient force organised under the supervision of Colonel Merrill), places them in a position to dictate their will to the tribes, and to enforce compliance, if necessary. The Kashgais, like all Nomad tribes, are singularly vulnerable when on the move. I have myself on two occasions witnessed a portion of the tribal migration, and anything more helpless than this mob of sheep, donkeys, cattle, &amp;c., all mixed up with women, children, and household goods, it would be difficult to imagine; and probably the merest threat to proceed against them by force when shifting from their summer to their winter quarters, or vice versa, would be sufficient to reduce them to instant submission. The fact that the great bulk of the tribe must necessarily cross the main road within a few farsakhs , of Shiraz also tends to simplify the problem. A glance at the map will show that the lines of the Kashgai migration converge both from the north and from the south, and cross the main Sliiraz-Bushire road in the short space between Chinar Rahdar, and Dashtarjin. This is precisely the section of the road where the gendarmes have posted themselves most strongly. In addition to the existing towers and caravanserais there are now under construction a number of block-houses on this stretch of road, and when these are completed and occupied by the gendarmerie, it will be possible for the latter absolutely to block any tribal movement with the minimum of difficulty and risk to t themselves. It is true that a section of the Kashkulis, and some quite minor sub-sections, have a route through the Mamasenni country which avoids the necessity of crossing the main red; but with the gendarmes in occupation of Shapur this fact would prove of but little advantage to them in the event of it being necessary to bring pressure fo bear upon them. In a word I am of opinion that the Kashgai question is one which has only to be firmly handled to be capable of a comparatively simple and satisfactory solution. Half the troubles and difficulties which have been occasioned by the Kashgais during recent years have been due to intertribal squabbles, jealousies, and intrigues, provoked by one or other of the hereditary llkhanis; or by the unquenchable hostility which exists between the Sowlet- ed-Dowleh and the Kawam-ul-Mulk. In my opinion, the abolition of the hereditary Ilkhaniship altogether, when combined with the presence of a stron°- government force on the Bushire road, will settle the Kashgai question once and for all (so far at least as there is any finality in any Persian policy that is to say), and will free the provincial administration from a long-standin 0, source • of anxiety and embarrassment. It only remains to be added that the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh’s notorious, and I believe ineradicable, hostility to the Kawam-ul-Mulk might possibly prove a very embarrassing circumstance should it at any time be found advisable to appoint the Kawam-ul-Mulk as Governor-General of Ears.This antipathy is mutual, and in spite of all outward appearances of reconcilia tion there is no ^ doubt that the real sentiments of the two men will never change. In addition to this the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh is more than suspected of having at different times engaged in intrigues with Russian Agents, and he is at this moment accompanied on his march to his winter (Quarters by the notorious Nimtaj, who is accredited in the popular view with being charged with a mission to the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh from Russian sources in Tehran. In a recent letter to the Consul, the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, after proclaiming his good will towards the British Government and again requesting its protection, 0 pro ceeds to throw out a very broad hint that if his request is not favourably considered, he will look elsewhere for the support which he requires. On the whole, therefore, I feel compelled to sum up the case adversely to the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. One must give him full credit for such good qualities as he possesses (and personally he is a pleasant and most hospitable man, far better endowed with the graces than his rival the Kawam-ul-Mulk), and for the fact that during the last ten months the conduct of the Kashgais,* taking it all round, has been really exemplary. But he is an arrant and incorrigible intriguer, and he does not possess the strength of character requisite to make him a really efficient Ilkhani, or to enable him to hold his own against hostile Kalantars or his brothers unbacked by government resources and the very fact of his hereditary claims, whilst securing the doubtful loyalty of some sections of the tribe, equally ensures the hostility and jealousy of the others. It is possible, no doubt, that the course of events in Southern Persia may give the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh some fresh opportunity of proving his w&lt; rth, and of displaying his good will to the British Government, and his loyalty to his own Government, in some manner more tangible than by mere talk: but it seems on the whole more likely that the natural progress of events will tend more and more to discredit him, and to emphasise the desirability of altering entirely the present system of succession to the Ilkhaniship of the Kashgais.

I was asked to-day by Colonel Hjalmarson, who has been ill for some time, to give you his assurance that any arrangement arrived at with the headmen on the Shiraz-Bushire road will be loyally adhered to by him. He said that, when he saw them last Spring, it was clearly understood by them that any arrangement which might be come to on the subject of subsidies would be temporary, being designed to allow time for the villagers to restart farm work on their land, when order should be restored. ■ A promise was also given by him that as large a number of them as possible would be employed as gendarmes or tufangchis. A telegram is being sent by the Colonel to Uggla to impress this on him, in which he also said that if, as he heard w'as the case, the payments which had been promised, had not been made by the Finance Administrations of Shiraz and Bushire, responsibility could not be laid on the Gendarmerie Administration.

It appears that, after main column gendarmerie moved down road, gendarmes at Kazerun proceeded to destroy towers and disarm villagers in vicinity. Villagers flocked into Kazerun, and last night, 21st, attacked gendarmerie barracks about sunset. Ali Muhammad, Kumariji outlaw, who, as already reported, had effected his escape with his whole hand and has been lurking in neighbourhood, joined in attack. About midnight gendarmes, 32 in number, evacuated barracks and fled to telegraph office, where they still are. Tele graphist, under orders from Assistant Superintendent, Shiraz, has^ taken charge of their arms so as to avoid armed conflict in telegraph office. Ali Muhammad, with band estimated at about 200, is said to have returned to Shahpur. Uggla has despatched force of 400 to 500 men to return Kazerun at once.

Finance Agent has been wounded and Sultan of Gendarmerie made prisoner. Gendarme officer at Rahdar caravanserai has joined Ali Muhammad. Several disarmed gendarmes have come into Kazerun. Dasii- tarjin reports that Pul Abgineh has been taken from gendarmes presumably by late Kadkhuda who was dismissed by gendarmerie some months ago, but who has been lurking in neighbourhood. Signaller, Kazerun, adds that, us far as he can gather, all prominent local people are in favour of Ali Muhammad who has sent out letters all over country inciting people to oppose gendarmes. Am just about to visit Governor-General and will report his views soon as possible. Meanwhile I am sending warning to all gendarme posts between here and Mian Kotal to be on alert.

Governor-General is of opinion that if returning Gendarmerie column is not attacked on road up they should not experience very great difficulty in restoring order at Kazerun and in recapturing Rahdar, &amp;c., from Ali Muhammad. He points out, however, that recent outbreak was due in great measure to tactless proceedings of Gendarmerie at Kazerun after departure of main body, and he considers it essential to be represented there by agent in whom he and all parties concerned can have confidence. He proposes, there fore, to despatch Darya Begi to Kazerun immediately with small force of 100 cavalry and 200 infantry. Darya Begi will assist in arranging local situation, and will support Gendarmerie in every possible way. He has personal relations with Ismail Khan of Pul Abginph and hopes to he able to secure restoration of that place to Gendarmerie without fighting. Only difficulty in way of under taking is lack of arms, and he has asked me to request XJggla to supply him with 300 old rifles now discarded by Gendarmerie and some ammunition. It is proposed that the 200 infantry shall proceed to Bushire, after matters are arranged at Kazerun, to be placed at disposition of Governor, Gulf Ports.

Latest advices from Kazerun received yesterday show that gendarmes have been completely successful over the rebel tribe, who endeavoured to block their passage. With a very small force they carried the difficult Tangiturka Pass, and took village and fortress by storm one after the other until Kazerun was eventually forced to surrender. The gendarmes under their Swedish officers appear to have behaved admirably. Unfortunately Ali Mahomet Kamariji succeeded in escaping, though his son-in-law was killed. Moral effect cannot fail to be very great, and Swedish officers by their patience and courage have proved their sterling worth. Losses of the gendarmerie were five killed and fifteen wounded. The enemy’s losses are known to he heavy, although it is impossible to estimate them accurately.[This Docament is the Property of His Britannic MaiestVs ftiwRi-nmcntl PERSIA.

The Governor of Bushire is now informing the Khan of the Ahmadi that he should oblige Major Uggla as requested. 2. Major Uggla addressed direct telegraphic appeal to the Sheikh of Mohammerah begging him, as agent for the Nizam’s properties near Baliki, to send special repiesentative to the headman to induce him to place his accommodation at the disposal of the gendarmerie without opposition. The Sheikh of Mohammerah will comply. Daliki is the crux of the situation, and, if successful there, the gendarmes are unlikely to have difficulty elsewhere. Both are officially acting thus with our cognisance and in the belief that it is in accordance with our wishes and advice, and that all is above board.

Monsieur Stas informs the Consul that he is experiencing the greatest possible difficulty in finding barley for the gendarmes horses. In fact, a general scarcity of grain of every kind prevails already all over the province, with correspondingly high prices, and it seems likely that the situa tion will grow more and more serious as the winter advances. Monsieur Stas is in consultation with the Governor-General and the Consul on the subject, and has already communicated certain proposals to Monsieur Mornard. /V A ! 6 DEC 1913m India, Foreign Secretary's No 4 7M, dated 20 .JV 1913152 Enclosure No. 2.

From- The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran (repeated Shiraz). I should be glad to know precise intentions of Commandant of Gendarmerie regarding policing of the road from Daliki to Bushire. I find that local authorities here are being asked to collect large stores of supplies at Borasjun and Bushire for use of gendarmerie, but I beg to point out that there has never been any prevalence of highway robbery on this section, it has been simply a question of the levy of rahdari and exorbitant prices. The Khan of Borasjun has now been squared by subsidy and employment of his men so far as his section of the road is concerned, and has already ceased rahdari while Shaikh Husain of Ahmadi is ready to accept a similar arrangement. It seems, therefore, useless expense both to subsidise these Chiefs and pay the gendarmerie for the same purpose. Perhaps the gendarmerie contemplate stopping these subsidies and amic able arrangements as soon as they are in a strong enough position to do so, but it will probably be a year at least before this is the case and meanwhile employment of both systems together seems unduly expensive and not free from risk of serious friction. Owing to scarcity and high prices of fodder the expense of supplying gendarmerie from here as they desire will be enormous. Enclosure No. 4. Telegram R., No. 367, dated (and received) the 27th October 1913. From—His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To—-His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran (repeated Resident, Bushire, No. 261). * EncloBure No. 3, ante. Please refer to Bushire telegram # No. 403—1807. Uggla’s plan is to take over whole road as far as Bushire and to distribute force of 187 men with 67 horses along section Bushire to limit of Borasjunterritory. Any arrangements made with chiefs along the road regarding subsidies and road guards are of purely provisional nature intenaed to facilitate task of taking over road. Once Gendarmerie are securely in posses sion of all caravanserais and towers, these expenses will be reduced to lowest possible minimum. If Cox is of opinion that safety of road and suppression of exactions can be secured by system of subsidies, and if Governor of Bushire is in a position to meet the expenses of such a system, it would no doubt be possible to dispense with Gendarmerie altogether on Bushire-Borasjun section. I was, however, under the impression subsidy scheme by itself had been abandoned as impracticable, and that it was generally accepted that only satisfactory way of keeping road open was by establishment along it of Gendarmerie. As to the question of expense, I understand that price of grain is con siderably less at Bushire than at Shiraz and, therefore, little or no additional expense will be incurred by establishment of Gendarmes down there as now proposed. I have discussed Cox’s telegram with Uggla and our views on these points are identical. Enclosure No. 5. Telegram R., No. 376, dated (and received) the 29th October 19 13. From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire (repeated Consul, Shiraz, No. 246). Shiraz telegram* No. 261 to you answers the question asked in first . ^ . , paragraph of your telegramf No. 403 to me. I have discussed situation with t Enclosure No. 3, ante. Colonel and Treasurer-General. Both are of opinion that it is now desirable that Gendarmerie should take possession of entire road as far as Bushire. I understand from Colonel that subsidy promised to Khan of Borasjun has not been paid and that he has begun again to levy rahdari. No serious resistance on road appears to be anticipated, and I am of opinion in the circumstances as I know them that best course is to carry out original scheme of taking over road down to Bushire, all subsidies to be reduced as much as possible and eventually stopped altogether. Failure to carry out a plan that is probably well known to all parties on road might make a bad impression. Enclosure No. 6.

I understand from Major Uggla that he has now received definite ins tructions from Colonel to occupy whole road as far as Bushire, and that these instructions were issued after consultation with Your Excellency and with your approval. Uggla will, therefore, carry out his programme unless these orders are cancelled. Meanwhile, I venture very respectfully to hope that Your Excellency’s views on this question will not he altered by arguments employed by Cox in his telegrams under reference which appear to me to display an erroneous view of the situation as a whole and to attach undue importance to susceptibilities and interests of certain petty chiefs who naturally loom somewhat largely on the Bushire horizon, but who are in reality quite insignificant factors in the politics of Southern Persia as a whole and who, in any case, have forfeited all claims to consideration by their scandalous conduct for years past which no one has denounced more consistently than Cox himself. I propose to submit further telegram this evening replying to Cox’s arguments on question of fact and detail.Enclosure No. 2. Telegram, No. 371, dated (and received) the 1st November 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran (repeated Bushire, No. 266). Very confidential. Continuation of my x Enclosure i. ante. telegram { 370. Two arguments§ advanced by Sir Percy Cox against gendarmerie occupying lower portion of road from Kotal Malloo § Serial Nos. 131 and 132. ^ J3 us hi re arGj first, question Of expense due to scarcity and high rates of fodder, and secondly, fact that subsequent modification of arrangements with Khans would imply bad faith. Firstly. As regards expense involved by establishment of gendarmerie posts on lower portion of road will be actual cost of expedition now about to proceed to Bushire, expenses of which are already included in gendarmerie budget for current year. I do not quite understand argument regarding extra expenses likely to be involved owing to scarcity and dearness of fodder. Barley and wheat are almost unobtainable at Shiraz, and prices are about thirty tomans per kharwar and are rising. Whereas at Bushire, I am in formed, that wheat is only 17^ tomans and barley 14 tomans per kharwar. Owing to scarcity at Shiraz gendarmerie at Kazerun are actually at this moment being supplied with barley from Bushire at price which, when cost of transpost is included, is less than price at Shiraz. It is, therefore, obvious that establishment of gendarmes at Bushire and lower section of road will result in very considerable saving. Should there be any scarcity of grain in Bushire, unlimited quantities can, I presume, be imported from Karachi and Mohammerah, and Major Uggla informs me that he has had offer of all he requires from Angali. As to transport, it is calculated that maximum number of animals which would be required to carry monthly supplies to Borasjun and Daliki would be 120 mules, but it is probable that arrangements can be made to reduce this number considerably. In any case, it is unlikely that arrangements will in any way interfere with commerce. This aspect of matter, therefore, presents no real difficulty of any kind either financially or otherwise. Secondly. Regarding arrangements with Khans. Situation at this mo ment is as follows :— No arrangement whatever has been concluded with Khans of Konar Takhteh, Daliki or Ahmadi. As to Khan of Borasjun, after first accepting certain terms and stopping rahdari, he afterwards demanded better terms and recommenced rahdari. This is my latest information on subject, and his conduct seems to deprive him of any claim to consideration. I may mention that I have advised Uggla from beginning not to pledge himself in any way to Khans in case he might find it necessary to revise arrangement later, and that all pourparlers have been conducted by Governor-General. There is, therefore, nothing to prevent gendarmerie taking over road to Bushire at once without breaking or altering any arrangement now in existence with one exception of that with Khan of Borasjun. And if it is thought that subsequent modification of this arrangement would be regarded as breach of faith, Uggla can telegraph at once to Khan to say that any arrangement made by him with Governor- General is only of temporary nature to be subject to modification by CJggla , ^ e . lxr 10Q when gendarmerie take over road. As to • Enclosure 6 to Serial No- Uggla’s letter* to Khan of Ahmadi, I have seen original French draft. It is perfectly harmless and unobjectionable document. It informs Khan in friendly terms that gendarmerie propose to leave a post of specified strength at Ahmadi and requests Khan to supply them with necessary accommodation. Similar letters have been despatched to other Khans along road and polite replies have been received from Konar Takhteh and Daliki. There is no stratagem in this oriental or otherwise. It is perfectly straightforward and honourable proceeding to which no exception can possibly be taken.158 It appears to me, therefore, that arguments advanced by Cox against gendarmerie occupying road as far as Bushire cannot be regarded as convincing. But, apart from details, I venture to urge that change of gendarmerie plans at eleventh hour would produce disastrous effect, and would be most serious blow to their prestige and future prospects. I have always understood from begin ning that it was intended that gendarmerie should occupy whole road from Shiraz to Bushire, and I think everyone else here was under same impression. To renounce or defer that intention now after months steady preparation would, I submit, be grave error. Nor can I understand why it is supposed that system of subsidies alone will solve long vexed road question. No faith can be placed in assurances of Khans, and it is surely preposterous that Persian Government should be expected to subsidise their own subjects permanently to refrain from unlawful acts when they have regular force equipped for very purpose of stopping out such evils and ready and anxious to perform their duties. I have discussed matter with Stas and Uggla and we are all strongly of this opinion. As to position of Bushire Besidency vis-a-vis Khans I cannot see that this position will be in any way prejudiced by execution of proposed gendar merie programme. Por years past Residency has complained of outrageous attitude of these people and project which will, it may be hoped, put an end to their scandalous behaviour on the road once and for all, is surely to be welcomed.

I am very sorry you should feel you ought to have been consulted sooner. I had no idea that there was any question of not taking over whole of road until Treasurer-General raised point about a fortnight ago, presumably on telegramf from Zwinne showing that f Enclosure No. 2 to Serial No. 139. fchere wou ld be a possible Saving of 4,000 tomans if the movement was postponed. Judging from previous corres pondence that had depicted state of country between Bushire and last Kotal as unsatisfactory, I imagined you would be in favour of entire road being taken over. I at once consulted Colonel, who telegraphed to Uggla. Latter replied strongly urging the entire occupation, and I concurred. It seems to me that possible disadvantages that may result from taking over entire road do not compare with probable bad impression that would be created by a change ot plans at last moment.Enclosure No, 5, Telegram R., No. 412—1846, dated the 4th November 1913.

Up to the present no sign has been given by the Government of India as to what their views are in regard to the questions in connection with the Shiraz post which were raised last summer. Personally I should prefer that, until those questions are settled, O'Connor should be kept north of Kazarun in view of the attitude he has adopted, especially as neither on this occasion nor the last has anything been said to me by him regarding his touring plans.

I have had the disadvantage of being absent all this month except for a brief visit when I sent my telegram I*o:403/1807 of October ^J6th. Please see correspondence ending with your telegram 376 to Bushire of October 29th. I quite appreciate the point of view of Gendarm erie ,namely that it will be more satisfactory to occupy the whole road provided always that they ultimately dispense with subsidies but I submit that while fin ancing the Gendarmerie we are not committed or concern ed to push them regardless of cost but rather to bring about the complete cessation of robbery and rahdari in | tk© mfcst economical manner w© can. At the xaxs present juncture firstly,the great scarcity of fodder and result ing dearth of transport and secondly,certain aspects of the sub.idy question cannot be lightly disregarded.As regards former problem I would ask your attention to Thiraz Diary for October 4th also to Zwinne^ telegram to komard of October 14th urging on cogent grounds of economy and expediency the de-irability of Gendarmerie not coining couth of Konar Takhteh before Horuz (Larch 23} To bring them down under present economic condition* means not only avoidable expenditure of many thousands of Tomans of fund supplied by H.M.G. but also great obstructionobstruction to trade owing to the inevitable command eering of transport for conveyance of large quantity of supplier required to victual the Gendarmerie from Bushire to Kazerun. Ac regards question ox subsidies Khan of Borasjun since commencement of payment feas ceaced levying rahdari while Ahmadi cum Ghagodak ic ready to do so on the xs&amp; ^ame term^. I suggest the following modifications of plans by adoption of which temporary difficulty may be avoid ed. Firstly, that having regard to prevailing security and the fact that they have settled the question of rahdari in the plains by ub^idization the Gendarmerie should for the present .top ^hort with the occupation of Kotal Halloo which will probably bring into line the headman of Daliki who has so fi*r rejected overtures. reeondly, that the xiih.x±d±a subsidy of the Khan of Ahmadi should be the ,&gt;ame as that of Borasjun as he bar to share his allowance with Chogadak. Thirdly, that any Khans subsidized should be informed that the present arrangement will be object to recon iderstion after 6 months experience. Fourthly, that in any case before the Gendarmerie come below the last Kotal Major Fg.jla ^ n come on to Bushire and discuss matters with the Governor of the Gulf port in who e jurisdiction the tract lies. Finance Agent and myself or my ; uccecsor ,the three per one in the be t po sition to advise regarding this p^rt of tfcnx the road and who have claim to be consult ed. Fifthly, that any agreement come to with the Khanc of Bora jun and Ahmadi hould have the official cognizance and written endor ement of the Governor of the Gulf Forts Repeated to hiraz &amp; Government of India.

On the other hand j it is clear from Hhiraas telegram 367 of October 27th to Y.F. and from letters which I have xesIbichM seen from Kajor Uggla to Governor that offer of or payment of sub sidy is only a ruse desig-ned to bring about peaceful \ occupation of the Khans* buildings and that it is con templated to cease the payment directly possession has been gained. In this connection I would mention that r, heikh of Ahmadi and Chogadak has just sent in for orders a letter received by him direct from Ltajor Uggla commencing with the obaequiou- Persian phrase 'fedayat ^hawam” (’Lay I be your caorifice*)and -aying that Khan will greatly oblige hi., friend Uggla and the Gendarmerie by planing hi build ing, at their service.

R. f G' ' ^ ' YOUR telegram No. 456 Colonel commandant of gendarmerie assures me that no action that he or any of his subordinates has taken with headmen on Bushire road can under any circumstances give ground for a charge of having shown bad faith. He says that he personally made it quite clear when he went down to Bushire last spring that any arrangements that might be made would be purely temporary and subject to modification as soon as restoration of order allowed villagers to resume their agricultural avocations. He also undertook to employ as many of their men as possible as road guards or gendarmes. He adds that his undertakings will be faithfully carried out. Whatever faults the Swedes may have, I am sure that they are by nature honourable, and it seems a little hard to accuse them at one moment of not being capable of understanding the wily Oriental and at another of tricking the simple- minded miscreants who have terrorised the Bushire road for the last few years. Expedition has now reached Kazerun, and taken over the Shapur district from Mohammed Ali Khan, who has agreed to hand it over to its rightful owners through their mediation. There appears to be some uneasiness on the road, and Khan Daliki apparently threatens resistance unless new unacceptable terms he has made are conceded. Gendarmes do not mean to be intimidated by his bluff, and would not be averse to a fight, which would establish their prestige on the road once and for all.—— r* CONFIDENTIAL. Sir W.

On return to Bushire towards the end of October after some weeks’ absence I received reports of grea.t scarcity prevailing all over the province with pos sibility of famine and was approached urgently by the Governor and the Belgian financial Agent begging me to support representations already made by them in my absence, that in view of scarcity of fodder and dearth of transport, gendarmerie should temporarily delay descent into low country until March, and pointing out that as Headmen of Borasjun and Ahmadl in Bushire plain had undertaken to stop Rahdari absolute ly in consideration of subsidies, and as Governor was ready to guarantee arrangement, descent of gendarmerie and their maintenance at famine prices had no present 10 MOV urgency*At the same time I leamt incidentally from a telegram from Acting Consul at Shiraz that 'any arrangements made with Chiefs along the road are of a purely provisional nature intended to facilitate the task of taking over road; once gendarmerie are securely in possession of all caravanserais and towers these expenses will he reduced to the lowest possible limits.' The first consideration seemed to afford cogent grounds, on the score of economy of British money, for temporary delay of the descent to low country while statement above mentioned appears merely an euphemistic description of a very oriental trick upon confiding Headmen who fully believe the offers are permanent, and that arrangement has British cognizance. I urged in view of scarcity that descent of gendarmerie might be temporarily delayed, and that lest our good faith should be called in question Headmen might be informed that subsidy arrangement would be subject to reconsideration after a specified number of months. I may mention that the Headman of Ahmadi apart from levy of moderate Rahdari has beenon the side of law and order In Bushire and came In himself with a force of Tufangchls during Said liurtaza disturbances of 190Q to support the authority of the Government and help maintenance of order.

Acting Consul at Shir as is strongly in favour of occupying the entire read and expresses the opinion that there will be small saving of expense by not doing so. He also argues that proceedings of the gendarmerie with Khans have been perfectly straightforward. Officer commanding at Shiraz and Belgian financial agent agree with Acting Consul. Colonel in command here and Treasurer General are of same opinion.
