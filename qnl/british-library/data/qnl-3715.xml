No.394/30/33, dated the 23rd September 1933 and translation of the Mutasarrif, Basra’s memo No.C/318, dated the 27th August to the Ministry of the Interior on the subject of the re- 2. As I believed the Mutasarrif’s letter contained several inaccuracies of fact, and as I me surprised to hear from you that the Prime Minister had told Sir Francis Humphrys that landlords in other parts of ’Iraq were set tling on a 50/50 basis, which is entirely at variance with my information, obtained from leading Kuwaitis who own property on the Shatt al Arab, I decided to show that Mutasarrif’s letter (mentioned above) in confidence , to Mr.Gabriel who was in Kuwait from the 7th October to ^pth October, and ask him for his criticisms. 3. I now append in the form of a short note 'A n supplied to me by Mr.Gabriel, Jfhis answers to the various points made by the Mutasarrif. 4. At my request he has given the same headings as were used by the Mutasarrif so you should have little difficulty in following Mr.Gabriel’s criticisms. 5. Before Mr.Gabriel returned to Basra on 9th October, I asked hi a to send me a note on the # Iraq Law J.H.B. Nihill, Esquire, Legal Secretary to cent troubles at Fao H.B.M’s Ambassador, BAGHDADmmmaam ’’'Iraq Law of Limitation'’, and how the said law might have been used to the great disadvantage of the Shaikh in the matter of his Fao Sstate. This note Mr.Gabriel sent me in the form of a confidential letter dated 12th October 1935, copy of which I now send you (Note 'B”). 6. You will the better understand the point of Mr. Gabriel's letter, ’when I say that ir the matter of the Fao disturbances, I havo always maintained and I have been steadily supported in my contention by Mr.Gabriel that the late Mutasarrif of Basra was deliberately working to actually dispossess the Shaikh of his Fao Estates, and that the affairs might have had most serious and far reaching results. 7. Whether he, the Mutaaarrif, received inspiration from Baghdad or not is a different matter and need not he discussed here. 8. The Mutasarrif knew that the Shaikh had no Tapu deeds, but in spite of this that he was in a strong position and could not easily be turned out because of the 'Iraq Limitation Law. So long, therefore, as the Shaikh was in possession i.e. his 'ta'abs* recognized him as landlord by paying their T 'mallakiyeh ft (landlords dues), so long would it be impossible to oust the Shaikh. 9. Could however the 'ta'abs' be persuaded to sud denly declare (as was done) that the Shaikh was not their rightful landlord, and refuse to pay any rental, and at the same time be persuaded to say that they were the owners themselves, and ask Government to support their claim, then the Shaikh would be in a quite different position. 10. In the first instance the Shaikh would have been a defendant and could afford to laugh at any effort made to dispossess him under the Law, while in the second in stance he would have been placed in the position of a plaintiff , asking for the Law's assistance against tenants- 3 - tenants who refused to recognize him. He would then have been called upon to prove ownership, which without Tapu Title deeds etc etc., would have been far from easy, especially if the head of the local Administration (as was the case) was against him. (See para 4 of Mr.Gabriel's letter). 11. Fortunately as I shall show in my official report the 1 ta'abs' have been tactfully managed by the Shaikh and his Lawyer and inspite of all the Mutasarrif's efforts they have been persuaded to come to Kuwait, and for the most part, to settle on a 56/44 basis and admit the Shaikh as their rightful landlord. 12. Only a very few 'ta’shs 1 have been allowed to set tle on a 50/50 basis, so far, this because their lands were bad or had suffered from floods etc. 13.

In this portion it is admitted by the Mutasarrif that the A1 Subahs have been in continual possession for at least eighty years (80), there remains therefore no cause to call upon history as to how they acquired the land inasmuch as even assuming that the land was original ly Miri (Government) the same has become Sirf Muik (sole ownership) end tne right of the Government to claim that the land is Miri has been, since 1890, time barred, (The time prescribed by law for claims by the Government pertaining to Miri lands is 36 years frcm the date of adverse possession). S.TA’AMUL BETY/BEN mE MALLiUi A1IL THB TA’AB, The 40 and other number of jeribs alleged to have been excepted as belonging to Al-Jabran and others is, far beyond the truth. The simultaneously made statement as to the payment of i of the produce thereof to the Shaikh, is sufficient to contradict the allegation^. S.DIFFflRBNggS. (Dispu te). (a) All the Shaikhs Ta’abs undertook to pay the Uallakia of the 1932 season at the basis of 56/44. Most of them inter paid in full, while some of them left certain balances unpaid. Consequently 25 law suits were filed ag against certain Ta’abs for the recovery of the balances. (b) Twenty three of the above mentioned suits were filed in the Court at Abul IChasib, and two in the Court of 1st instance at Basrah. The suits at Abul Khasib Court came up for hearing first, when the counsel of defendant having denied the Shaikh’s ownership to the land and having requested the Court, passed an order celling upon the2 - upon the counsel of the Shaikh to produce the title deeds. (c) Shaikh’s counsel appeared before Abul Khasib Court on the day of rehearing of the case and was prepared to submit his arguments. But when he was called and ap peared te he found that defendant’s counsel was absent and therefor© asked for an ex parte’ Judgement which was accordingly passed. Six Ta’abs accepted the judgement while 17 Ta’abs objected there—to and the day for hearing the objection was fixed for Sunday the 24th October 1933. (d) The two suits in the Basrah Court came up for hearing on the 10th of July. One of them was dismissed from the Court’s Jurisdiction point of view. The other suit under No.36 of 1033 was heard (as a te st case it was At was a most important one for having been decided by a full bench of the central 1st Instance Court). The counsel of defendant brought up the same defence (as in a previous case before the single judge at Abul Khasib) and asked the Court to pass an order calling upon plain tiff’s (Shaikh’s) counsel to produce the title deed. laintiff’s counsel argued that defendant’s defence was quite irrelevant inasmuch as the claim was not one for an ejectment or restoration of ownership of property. It was purely a pecuniary one for the value of the balance of dates short delivered by defendant under an oral agreement. (e) The Court therefore rejected defendant’s plea, and in view of his counsel’s refusal to answer the plaintiff’s claim ordered bjm to bring his client (defendant) person ally before the Court on the next hearing 18th July 1953. The defendant and his Counsel having not appeared on the said date (18.7.33) and on the request of the plaintiff’s counsel, the Court passed an ex parte Judgement against defendant to pay Iraq Dinars 50/- with costs to plaintiff. Defendant’s counsel, on the 31st August 1933, filed an3 filed an objection against this ex parte judgement repeating the plea which ho had recorded on the previous hearing des pite the fact that the Court had ruled it against him* This 'Objection” case was to have ccme up for hearing on the 10th October 1933« (f) It is important to note here that defendant’s counsel (legal adviser of all the Ta’abs at Fao) had pro mised to secure for them (Ta’abs) a title of independant ownership to the Fao lands and because of this promise and the absence of Government’s assistance to the Agent of the Shaikh despite his repeated verbal and written applications, the Ta’abs were groat1/ encouraged, and almost all of them refused to pay the customary dues for 1933 to the Shaikh and recognize their position, (g) The ivgent of the Shaikh having entirely failed to secure Government help so far resolved as from 3rd August 1933, to adopt a course of diplomacy with the w Ta’e.be r ' whereby and after many difficulties he succeeded, on the £9th August 1933 in aaouring a final agreement with the ring leaders of the Ta’abs. As s result the unity of the Ta’abs / was broken, and they were divided into many parties, each trying to surpass the ether in securing the satisfaction of the Agent, and that of the Shaikh. (h) On the 26th August 1933 (3 days before the final agreement with the ringleaders) the tlutasarrif, Basra, called the agent of the Shaikh and proposed a settlement on C50/50 basis through him (Kataserrif) this the agent declined to accept for certain reasons (already reported(. (i) The final ”agreements come to with most of the Ta’ubs was on a 56/4-4 basis, while that with certain of the ringleaders contained two conditions: (1) That the produce should be calculated and collected at 5C and 50 basis i.e. half to the Shaikh and half to the Ta’ab: (2) That all lawamma /3 law suits referred to as having been filed against the Ta'abs be withdrawn, they for their part recognizing the Shaikh as their landlord.

Most of them have failed in their attempt because they have definitely written agreements with their Mallaks to pay on a 56/44 basis. Gome of them, however, due to the absence of any such written agreements, and because Mallaks wish to avoid taking legal action, are paying on a 50/50 basis today e.g. The Aghawat of Mecca; A portion of the Faddaghiyeh Estate (Imperial Bank of Per si e. 1 s property) • It is said also that the Awqaf Department and the Senia (Government) also pay on a 50/50 basis, but with these exceptions the almost universal custom is for Ta’abs and Mallaks to settle on the 56/44 basis. 4,1HS PRACTICE TA*ABS SHAR2S.

I feel a bit better today and am writing the following in fulfilment of promise. 1. That Iraq. Limitation Law provides that notions by the Government in connection with restoration of Kiri Lands shall not be entertained by the Court after a period o of 56years from the date of adverse possession provided always that defendant states in his defence: (a) thet it is his property (b) that he has been in continual possession tar 2. The Lawyer of the Ta’abs of ITao had all along been stating before the Courts and official Departments that the J?ao lands were originally reclaimed lands covered by sea water from time to time and the ancestors of his clients (Ta*abs) having filled and dyked, cultivated and planted same with palm trees whereby they have become the rightful holders thereof and have been in continual possession for over on© hundred years. The said lawyer did also ask the Government toallow the title thereto (Tarwidh) in the name of hi* clients (Ta'abs) as e* right ful holders of the lands in question. 5. So long as the Shaikh of Kuwait is in actual pontinual possession the Government is barred by the law of limitation to institute an action, as plaintiff, against him (Lhaikh) for restoration of the ?ao as Miri a long period, exceeding 36 years and that he is still continuing to be in actual possession. land 4. Had the Ta*abs continued their refusal to pay- 2 - r pay any revenue to the Shaikhs as Mallakia (owner’s revenue)-the the position would have been perhaps as follows: (a) That the Shaikh would have been out of actual possession in which case and in the absence of the administrative Government help he would have been compelled to go to Court where it would have been doubtful to secure a judgement in favour of Shaikh. (b) In the absence of a gavourable judgement for the Shaikh the Ta’ abs would have naturally be come the sole holder cf the land in question. (c) the Government would then immediately step in and ask the Ta’nbe to pay in the Kallokia to the Government. The Ta T abs could no more plead long possession and thereby rebut the Government’s claim inasmuch as their lawyer had already ad mitted before the Courts and the Official Departments that the land in question was origin ally reclaimed land and asked for Tafwidh as such (Miri). For this admission on the part of the 3bawyer amounts to estoppel to claim that the action of the Government is barred by the law of limitation (vide Section 1674 of Majala (Civil Code). 5. I may venture to submit that the principal dif ference between the Iraq Limitation Law and that of Snglish seems in my humble opinion to be: (a) that while a person can become a plaintiff under the English law in an action to ask for a de claratory decree by virtue of his long possession (beyond the time prescribed by law) in a property he cannot become so under the ’Iraq Limitation Law3 ** (b) that the plea of Limitation uider the Iraq Limitation Law is admissible only for defendant and never for plaintiff. (c) The Iraq Limitation Law never allows acquisition of ownership by long period of possession whereas that of English allows such acquisitions There are of course other differences but the foregoing may serve the point re the subject in view.

From Lt.-Colonel H.R.P.Dickson, C.I.S., I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait; To TTie Hon T bis the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S K I R E Agrarian Troubles on Shaikhs FAQ Estates \&gt; ' Sir, V' 'In continuation of my confidential despatch No. SO9, dated the 6 th September 1933 and my telegram No.221, dated the 18th September 1933, I have the honour to make the following report. 2. Alien the news got about early in September that the ITutasarrif, Basra, Abdur Razsak al Hilmi was shortly to be transferred to Hilla, rn immediate and marked im provement came over the whole Fao situation. A further 36 of the Shaikh T s leading fellahs or Sarkals (headmen) came down to Kuwait accompanied by the Shaikh’s lawyer, and in a notable interview with the Shaikh confessed that they had been deceived and led astray and wanted to resume their old relations #ith him. The leaders of this deputation, including three ringleaders in the troubles, next visited me in the Agency and I was able to have a heart to hea^rt talk with them. T^hy clearly believed that His Majesty’s Government had been instrumental in arranging for the re moval of the Mutasarrif, and I did not discourage this belief. I told them among other things that the ICing of ’Iraq and the Shaikh of Kuwait were equally the friends of the British Government and that we would neither countenance the intriguesintrigues of evil people who attempted to make mischeif between these two rulers nor would we fail to support the Shaikh with the f Iraq Government, if they (the Shaikhs tenants) attempted to indulge in any agrarian troubles of a communistic nature, whereby the Shaikhs rights as land lord were threatened. Their bad behaviour as tenfents had come to the notice of His Majesty^ Government and His Majesty’s Government had decided to interfere and give her fullest support to their frined, the Shaikh, etc. etc. 3. The net result of this visit of the Shaikh’s fellaheen was (a) The signing in Kuwait of 'Iltizams' (agreements) in respect of the whole of the Fao property by Sirkals repre senting 70 % of the fellaheen on a 56/44 basis; (b) The signing of 'Iltizams” on a 50/50 basis by Sirkals representing some 30 % of the tenants: (c) The appointment of a special 'tfakil' from Kuwait to permanently reside,and represent the Shaikh, at Fao. (This person has since taken up his residence in the Shaikh’s country house there); (d) The submission of the ringleaders, their recog- mi ti on of the Shaikh of Kuwait as their landlord, and their promise to give no trouble in future. 4. The shaikh for his part gave handsome presents to all of his Sarkals and in a later suitable speech ex horted them to remember that he and his forefathers had always been their best of friends; that they and their families had worked for and with the A 1 Subah family, their rightful landlords for close on 100 years and ha®/# never cause for complaint. Lastly he urged them to come direct to him should they ever have any other complaints or feel they had a grievance and not permit themselves to bee one the tools of mischeif makers, who wished ill both to the A1 Subah and themselves, etc. etc. 5. The Sarkals then returned to Fao an „ v, a °’ and the 8W,a - 3 - 8tli October all excitement may be said to have died down again, and the situation to have returned to as near normal as could be expected. 6. The Shaikh tells me that as a result of all this trouble he has, unfortunately, lost in stolen dates, fruit, lucerne grass, firewood, etc, approximately Rs,10,000; and that he has paid out in presents at Basra, Siba and rao (including lawyers fees) close on Rs. 39 , 000 /-, all of which he bitterly said, could have been saved him, had the Iraq Government pleyed the game and come to his assistance in the beginning by taking action against the ringleaders in the movement against him, as he had originally asked. 7. The Shaikhs lawyer, Mr.Gabriel, who visited Kuwait as recently as 7th to 9th October also told me in recapitulating recent events that a most serious situation, in fact a deliberate and organized attempt to dispossess the ohaikh of his Fao lands had been fortunately safely frustrated. The chief trouble maker in the piece, he said, had been the late Mutasarrif, who, advised that the Law ol Limitation' would frustrate him h in his efforts to oust the Shaikh by direct methods, had deliberately gone to work to get the fellaheen to revolt, declare the Shaikh to be no landlord of theirs, to testify that they themselves were the original and true landlords, to refuse to pay rental, and lastly to appeal to the ’Iraq Government to assist them get justice. 3. All would have gone well for the Mutasarrif, added the lawyer, had he not made the tactical error of sending verbal orders to the 'Ta’abs” (fellahs) to refuse to hand over to the ohaikh any dates or produce generally from his property, and to claim protection from the ’Iraq Govern ment against the Shaikh, who was an interloper. These orders were, he said, actually given to the Mukhtar of FaoFao who passed them on to the Sheikhs fellaheen. The Sheikhs lawyer countered the move by immediately writing officially to the Mutasarrif and in viting him to deny that the said orders had been issued by him. He added in his letter that he had been told by the Mukhtar himself and the recalcitrant fellahs that he (the Mutasarrif) had issued such orders. The Mutasarrif in a -dilemma was forced to deny the story. This saved the -situation, but the Mutasarrif to the end tried to revenge himself on the lawyer. 9o Another factor in righting the situation was the straightforward conduct of the -^aimMakam of Ciba, In whose administrative area the Shaikhs Fao lands lay. He apparently and contrary to the Mutasarrif f s orders mentioned above, issued urgent instructions to the fellahs that unless they ceased acts of sabotage and agreed to pay their landlord his rightful dues, he would proceed most rigorously against their ringleaders. 10. These contrary orders from different administra tive superiors caused uncertainty and an early split among the fellaheen, and. gave the Gliaikhs lawyer, as well as the Shaikhs Agent, ihe opportunity they sought. They visited the fellahs and by diplomatic and tactful means made them see the error of their ways. It was at this juncture that they were persuaded to go to Kuwait and make their peace with the Shaikh. 11. The fhaikhs lawyer added that the affair has ended as successfully as it has by the sole efforts of the Shaikh,himself and the Qaimmakam of Siba. He was most strong on the point that neither the Government of ’Iraq nor the late Mutasarrif gave any assistance or help at all from the beginning, on the contrary apparently did - all in their power to attack the Shaikh and wrest his property from him. In his (the lawyer’s) opinion had not /f5 had not the Assyrian question come up and distracted attention in Baghdad, nothing short of a British warship at Fao Y/ould have restored the situation. 12. As it is, the lawyer, Mr.Gabriel, gave it as his considered view that the * Iraq Government would come back to the attack with even greater vigour as soon as they had cleared up the Assyrian mess. His underground inform ation from Baghdad, which had rarely been at fault, he said, convinced him that the trouble was only scotched, not ended. 13. I apologize for the length of this letter, but I am most anxious that you get a true picture of recent happenings and what people are thinking about, for I regret to say that I also take the view that we shall hear more f of this Fao business later if not this year then next, and probably just before the dates ripen once more. 14. In conclusion, I note that in some quarters there is a tendency to think that the whole i’ao trouble is nothing more than a noisy dispute as to what percentage of the produce the fellahs should pay the Shaikh. I trust that my above remarks will show that the trouble has had a much deeper and significant origin. The mere fact that the Shaikh has gone 'all out' to avoid the f Iraq 'Courts' and arrive at a direct settlement with his tenants, was because he and his lawyer, Mr.Gabriel, realized in time the trap they were being shepherded into. Although a settlement has been arrived at, it should be realized that the Shaikh has given av/ay much in money and prestige and, it will take him sometime to recover the ground he lias lost with his tenants.

A copy ia enclosed. It wea not an order, but a notification that the Tepu office would re-open for the tranaaotion of business. It wee published in the dally 'Basrah Timea* from the 3rd to 7th May, 1915, inclusive. Unfortunately for our purposes it was not issued by the General Officer Commanding but by 3ir Henry Dobbs himself his responsibilities for the ‘Tapu Department. There appear to be no copies available in 'Iraq of the General routine Orders of the Amy of occupation of the period in which such an order might possibly have appeared but Bir Henry Dobbs himself says in his letter that he believes that no Buoh o was ever published. ithout it the notification in the Basrah Times cannot attain the statue of an order by the General Officer Commanding and la practically valueless so far as the Kuddaghlyah sstates are concerned. as evenue Commis*loner. We have not been able to discover any order or prodam*ttan issued by the General Offleer Coii^andlng that gave Sir Henry Dobbe any powers at all, even ee wevenu* Commissioner, nor is there any definition of You C.

I am advised that there is little risk that any Tepu deeds given by the Revenue Cow*!satoner In regular manner, and In conformity with Turkish lew, will be Impugned. You will see from the notification Itself that Tcmu deeds were to se prepared “under the former laws and ’orders' and It la reasonable to assume this was adhered to and that sanado were lnwued in a regular mannor and are, for all purposes, valid. The danger of invalidation of title would only exist where Tapu deeds were Issued Irregularly and not in strict conformity with the technical requirements of Turkish law. There are no means of ascertaining whether any irregular deeds were Issued. v e know that In the Paddaghiyah case this was so, but tt la quite likely thut this was the only Instance, briefly put, there is no attack upon the validity of the re opening of the or of the bona fide transactions registered therein. The flaw in the Paddaghly*&gt;h title deeds exists because the Revenue Commissioner In Issuing them went outside the terms of his notification and, for reasons which at the time appeared to be good and compelling, granted them not in accordance with the “laws ?md orders’. I am driven to the conclusion that we should not be able to argue with conviction that the non-validation of the Tapu deeds issued for the Fciddaghlyah estate would have a serious detrimental effect upon regular Tapu transactions carried out In &gt;ssrah during the Occupation. Tt is the legality of these particular deeds, not the operation of the Tapu Department, which Is In jeopardy. Yours ever, (rigned) Oeorgs O.

With reference to my No.249, dated the 17th October 1933, I have the honour to inform you that further ♦feelers* have recently been put forward by K.B.Mirza Mohamed Khan, C.I.E., lawyer to the two ladies interested in two thirds of the Faddaghiyeh suit, regarding the possibility of a money compromise being arrived at between His Excellency the Shaikh and his clients. 2. &amp;r.Gabriel, tfio was here again recently, delivered a message to me to this effect from Mirza Mohamed, mentioning that the ladies would now accept £ T.5,000/-, between them (or £ T.2,500/- each). 3. Mr.Gabriel said hb was against smch compromise him self, but considered it his duty to deliver Mirza Mohamed*s message. 4# I told Mr.Gabriel verbally that I also was quite against such a proposal and did not propose to worry the Shaikh by mentioning the matter to him. 5. In my opinion the sisters, advised by this lawyer, are anxious to bring about a money settlement (considerably reduced on their first offer, as you will see), because they have got wind that His Majesty’s Government have interested themselves seriously in the matter (contrary to vfcat they expected) and are now trying to get the case quashed.2 6.

AL-SUHAH MEDDLING. The Al-Subah have now turned their attention to the political task of creating dissension among the different clas ses of Fellaheen, so that they can preserve their centrol over -them those lands, which they have seized from the legal owners by means of their well known methods. »7e understand that their (the Al-3ubah f s) agent at Basrah has been seducing some of the Fellaheen (from the right path) and has begun to give them large presents for the sole purpose of getting them against those who are only claiming their ri^its. This indeed seems to be a new way of doing things, which may easily be copied by others who want to devour the rights of the Fellah. We bring this to the Government’s attention and ask them to seize hold of the hands of the man who is trying forcibly to remove the veil from the eyes of justice. THE FAQ FELLAHEEN. There is much excitement among the fellaheen at Fao similar to what is happening on the Faddaghiyeh Estate against the Al-Subah. The latter are cleverly playing fast and loose with the rights of the Fellah so as to gain their own ends. We learn also from local sources that the Al-Subah have so ex tended their severe regime as to bring about a general feeling of restlessness among the fellaheen, this, inspite of their (the Fellaheen’s) undoubted rights and proved documents. We ask the High Authorities to take necessary action against Al-Subah and compel them to follow the right path and carry out the usual engagements, which exist between them and the Fellaheen. We also ask the Government to protect their subjects from the intrusion of such foreigners. Your Correspondent.CONFIDliflTU AL POLITI CAL AG^CY , KUWAIT. Dated tho 19th December 19 3; No.299.

Sir, f ‘ In continuation of my despatch No.284, dated the 29th November 1933, I have the honour to report that I re ceived a call yesterday (18.12.33.) from Mr.Gabriel, the Shaikh’s Lawyer, who is down on a four days business visit from Basra. 2. Mr .Gabriel spent 2 hours with me and among other things gave me the following very significant item of news which he quoted as an * ab solute fact and not open to any doubt whatsoever. 3. The Mutasarrif, Basra, acting under instructions from the Minister of Interior, Bagdad had very confidentially approached Abdulla al Zuhair, the plaintiff in the Baddaghiyeh Suit and had asked him to accept I.D.2,500/- or a maximum of I.D.3,000/- to stop all further proceedings. 4. Abdulla al Zuhair, under the advice and pressure of his lawyer, Mr.Sulaiman al Shawaf, had so far refused the Mutasarrif’s offer, for the following reasons:- (a) He was under written agreement with his lawyer to pay him I.D.2,000/-, whether the case was won or compromised out of court: (b) He had to pay approximately I.D.250/-in court fees, and over and above this, a sum of I.D. 1,500/- to the guarantor who had guaranteed payment of the above court fees to the court in the event of he (Abdulla al Zuhair) losing his case. Mr.Sulaiman al Shawaf, I believe, is the son of the President of the Sheria Court in Baghdad. 5 # Clearly, as Mr .Gabriel pointed out, Abdulla al Zuhair could not reasonably be expected to accept I.D.3,000/- •hush money 1 , when he stood to lose I.D.3,750/- in making payments to his confederates. 6. In the meanwhile, added Mr.Gabriel, the ’Iraq Government appeared to have lost sight of the astuty^e Mr.Mirza Mohamed, C.I.E., legal adviser to the other two claimants to the Faddagfriyeh Estate (namely the ladies Najeeba and Aida). This person was apparently entirely wide awake to what was going on and fully aware of the secret negotiations in progress between the Mutasarrif and Abdulla al Zuhair. Naturally, said Mr .Gab-'lei, Mirza Mohamed, would at once come forward as soon as Abdulla al Zuhair’was squared*, and demand a similar sum from the Mutasarrif for each of his two lady clients as the price of their keeping their claims out of the courts. In other words, said Mr.Gabriel, if the ’Iraq Government were going to offer financial inducement to Abdulla al Zuhair to withdraw from the case, then they must expect to make similar con cessions to Najeeba and Aida, who had equally strong claims, and a very good lawyer on their side. 7. The above interesting developments appear to me worthy of His Majesty’s Government’s consideration, firstly because it is possible that the ’Iraq Government may turn round later and ask His Majesty’s Government to foot the final Bill under the excuse that it had cost them so much3 - 'so much' to persuade the three claimants to compromise the case, and secondly because it affords an excellent example of how state secrets cannot be kept in ’Iraq. I am assuming, of course, that His Majesty’s Embassy is un aware 6f the offer to Abdulla al Zuhair . 8* Mr.Gabriel incidentally mentioned that rumours to the effect that the ’Iraq Government were trying to com promise the Faddaghiyeh Case, had already reached the ears of the ladies whose interests he had represented in the 'Bashiyeh' Case and were causing them much anxiety. They had recently visited him and pointed out that the Lower Court as well as the Appeal Court, had given a decree in their favour, and appealed to him to try and find out when the decree would be served, so as to enable th«n to take possession of the Bashiyeh. They (the ladies) had told him that they felt that the Ministry of Justice were holding up proceedings for political reasons which, opined Mr. Gabriel, was probably the case. Mr.Gabriel naively enquired from me as to what was the best way to keep these troubled ladies quiet. 9. I asked Mr .Gabriel if he thou$i fc that when the Bashiyeh property was finally taken from the Shaikh of Kuwait and given to his clients, vfrtether the Shaikh could successfully bring a counter claim against them for the original purchase price. His reply was a definite negative. I have the honour’ to be Sir Your most obedient servant Lt.-Colonel Politi col Agent,Kuwait •4./ SECRET. No.309 POLITIC AI. AGENCY, KUWAIT.

Nihill, as you know, has now left us, and there is nobody here qualified to discuss the intricacies of the Ottoman Law, or the legal points which Mr. Gabriel wants to talk about. It is unlikely that we shall be granted the privilege of a successor to Nihill, and I am therefore afraid that the beneficial results which might have been derived from the suggested discussion must be foregone.

In line 10 of the first page, His Majesty’s Ambassador says, 'The Shaikh’s Attorney has however dis covered a legal defect in it which may seriously affect its usefulness n . If you will refer to my 'Secret” despatch No. 30 9, dated 21st December 19 33 and to my ’’Secret” despatch No.316, dated 29th December 1933, you will see that the second Power of Attorney obtained fran Istanbul contained no such legal defect, and the names of the ' two missing witnesses’’ were correctly recorded in the document. This fact seems to have been overlooked by His Majesty’s Ambassador in his Saving t elegram No.3 of 2nd March to the 3. In line 4 of page 2 of the same Saving telegram, under reference, His Majesty’s -ambassador uses the words 'in spite of gossip reported by interested Armenian Lawyer may possibly have been overlooked by you Foreign Office to Political Agent, Kuwait” With/With the very greatest diffidence, I would remark that this surely is not quite a fair thing to say of Mr. Gab riel’s valuable information as reported in ray Confidential despatch No. 302, dated 19th December. After all Mr. Gab riel received his first legal training under Colonel Knox when the latter was Chief Judge in Basra, and later completed same in the Law Schools of Calcutta after the war, where he came cut with flying colours. We must, I think, credit him with being sincere and honest until we find him out to be other wise. 4. In line 6 of page 2 of the same Saving telegram under reference, His Majesty’s Ambassador says, ”1 am in formed that the Ministry of Justice is considering taking disciplinary action against plaintiff’s Attorney on the grounds of ’’champerty”. As I cm not a lawyer and know little of legal phrases, I should be grateful if you could let me know what the term ’’champerty?! means. If it refers to the action reported to have bean taken by Abdulla al Zuhair, the plaintiff in the Faddaghiyeh easel as described in paras 3, 4 and 5 of my Confidential despatch No.302, dated 19th December to you) it would appear as if the contents of my despatch in question had been in some way oonveyed to the ’Iraq Ministry of Justice which does not seem quite fair to Mr.Gabriel or the Shaikh of Kuwait. ^ • I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant Lt.-Colonel Political Agent, Kuwait.XX ~elefr-ar ^row TT,W.Secretary of *+n.tp for 1?l oTai# 7 n London. o K.H. ^ Aw’bannador, ^a^bdad.

From our Western point of view it might be argued that such attach though in 'bad form' are in the nature of honest criticism and do little harm. The difference however is that we are dealing with the East, and an Arab Ruler in close relations of friendship with us. Not only should we, I think, try and take all steps to keep his fair name from being be smudged, but we should realize that such attacks hurt deeply, where to a Westerner they would perhaps cause amusement. 4.

The activities and power of bandits seem to grow day by day at Fao, this is the more apparent since the arrival of a master bandit notorious for his methods in the days of Shaikh Ehazaal Khan, the ex-iimeer of Mohamnerah, who, it is said, was brought in by the supporters of the A1 Sabah, with a view to inspire terror in the hearts of their perverse 'Ta’abah* (farmers). Latest persecutions indeed, support and bear out the truth of what we say, for all homes attacked belong to to those in opposition to the Al Sabah, as distinguished from others. We, further, understand that the population there (Shaikh’s Fao Estate) have decided to buy fire arms to defend their lives, and that they will apply for these to the authorities, and complain against those who are behind the bandits, and egg them on to do what they do.

As it was the ’Iraqis who took the initiative - incident ally in the presence of Colonel Doch - I think it better for tactical reasons not to betray too much eagerness for immediate settlement as this may tend to stiffen resistance.

Before the Ambassador's departure, the King reiterated to His Excellency that His Majesty would not expect to receive more than £2,000 from His Majesty's Government, In view of the above it is disconcerting to find that matter is being re-raised to the tune of an extra thousand pounds.

I am sorry for the length of the telegram that I sent, but I thought that if the natter was really as serious as it appeared, it might be inadvisable for me to delay cormunication or to communicate only meag^re information. So I tried to make the telegram as self-contained as was consistent with economy, so that before taking action you might not have to await the Shaikh’s letter (now attached), which will not reach you before 1.9.34 in any case, but may on the other hand be indefinitely delayed at Bushire pending occurence of a safe opportunity of transmission.

We usually, at the beginning of the season w Thamareh w of every year, appoint some certain persons from among the 'fallaheen' themselves and their neighbours to assess 'Kharas' the dates on the trees after which the n Dhaman n takes place, and after that every fallah is held responsible for whatever is under his charge. These days our representative sent some persons n Khawaris n for Fao and Faddaghiyah as usual. When they began to assess n Kharas w the fallaheen, men as well as women, began to call them (the M Khwaris') nasty names and threw stones at them and struck them with sticks, as a result of which some of them got wounds. We are greatly perturbed at this action which is caused by the fallaheen without reason, but that of proposing to occupy our gardens, and making us lose our rights. We had a thought to appoint one of our sons accompanied by some servants to be in our gardens for protection and watch, but we delayed that, because we do not like that our neighbour the (Iraq Government should have suspicions (of any nature). Our representative has reported the insurgents to authorities at Basra, but I regret that the * Iraq Government have not taken any drastic measures to prevent and punish the mischief-makers for£-2 for their activities. We are so greatly distressed that we are of the opinion that the 'Iraq Government are allowing these dangerous events to happen to our gardens and our product. I think that the 'Iraq Government do not hate these events to happen against us, because we are under His Majesty's Government and their followers. season 'Thamareh' and the action of the fallaheen, who the 'Iraq Government do not punish severely which cause us to lose our rights, I shall be much grateful if you will take the necessary care and attention to this matter immediately, because of the approaching time, and if the product is not protected how , it will be lost and our rights as well.

It appears that the Shaikh, according to his usual custom, recently sent surveyors from among the fellaheen themseltfes to assess the quality of the standing date-crop.

Can you gyaraatec* the UUes of toe ihalkh to /arhanlyah, kutawaa and ?ao are aorreot* Dae answer j advise you to give to tnese two questions is no. Rejaaaa* &amp;s to question NO. 1- At present you only have the list given by Colonel Dickson. l think that this list describes the haikh's properties by the administrative units in which they are situated and the gardens are known by different names, for instance farhattiyah is in my opinion the same as Kut al Khalifa, faddaghiyah is divided into 3 or 4 gardens and will appear as one garden. 1 think it probable that the shaikh's property is confined to those 4 particulars areas. ihere is however no list In Tapu office Bagdad shoeing the properties in each of theae areaa and even if there was it is likely that sane of the Shaikh's properties are not registered in tapu. Xou »«mot therefore guarantee either there are 4 properties or that the 4 properties are the one called ysrhanlyah, *utawaa, fadda ghiyah and fao. As to question No. 8 . 1 m informed that the hhaikh has undoubtedly encroached both free the river side and from the land beyond his original boundaries. this is quite a usual'£l usual thing and can naarly always *# mA® legal by paying r certain busi known as feadal raitiael• However fbr certain reasons this mm has not been paid with the result that - sanads showing the land in possession of toe SiaiJch in 1914 will neither include the areas in respect to which he had encroached in 1914 or still leas the areas encroached on ainoe 1914 but which the lhaikh cultivators now probably claim are a part of its original gardens comprised in the registers (if so registered)* further there may be disputes as to boundaries between the Shaikh and his Sasrawi neighbour a. /or the above reasons 1 cannot advise that you can guarantee these titles* I have enquired from both Tapu and finance and am unable to get a complete list of the properties owned by the Shaikh. A list supplied by finance corresponds n^ariy in area to the list supplied by Oolonel Dickson as to ^arhaniyah (kut al Khalifa) but I cannot check it against fao and as to fbddaghiyah the area in the finance list is double that given by colonel Dickson and the butawaa cannot be checked as Colonel Dickson gave no area* yours siaoerely f ($ 8 d») Q*Alexander* G* 0G1GV1K fUHH&amp;S XSt*&gt; 0*1«0«COPY O From H.M.

Judge Alexander considers that it is probable that all the properties covered by the 1914 pledge are confined to the four areas specified /■ in ray telegram No. 192 but this eannot be guaranteed as Tapu Department have no list showing the properties in each of these areas and it is likely that some of the Shaikh's properties are not registered in Tapu* Indeed I am Informed that some were registered in the names of slaves. 3. with regard to the second assumption namely, that his titles to gardens in areas one, two and four are sound. Judge Alexander states that the Shaikh has Indulged in a practice common to property owners by encroaching beyond the original boundaries, an act which might be legalised by the payment of a certain sum. For certain reasons this sum has not been paid with the result that the sanads held by the Shaikh will not include the areas on which he had encroached by 1914 nor the areas encroached on since 1914 which may be claimed as part of the original gardens. There may also be boundary disputes with neighbours of which upon* we are not aware. Neither Tapu nor the Ministry of FlmmCOPY OF TELEGRAM. r From H.M. Ambassador, Bagdad. To.

Judge Alexander warned me that in spite of my reference to all comers, the 'Iraq Government might make an attempt to limit the transaction to ABDULLAH &amp;UHAXR. Against this I am on my guard. He also added that in his opinion we should not only obtain validation but also a promise of oompefcsation for the Shaikh in case of dispossession after validation. This I do not scope of the conditions laid down by His Majesty's Government. 6 . Since the above was written the Prime Minister, Who as the King's Private Secretary has taken a leading part in these negotiations, has called on me and emphasised the difficulties in the way of validating properties the existence or legality of which might not be ]mown to the 'Iraq Government.

During the troubles which broke out on the iao estates of His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait in the autumn of last year, the Shaikh’s lawyer brought before the Basrah Court a number of cases against the fellaheen, wno were refusing to hand over to the Shaikh his proper share of the proceeds of the date crop . In s ome of these cases the Courts decided that His Excellency the Shaikh should be requested to swear an oath before the Political Agent, Kuwait, to the effect that he had not received from the defendant the dates claimed. It was accordingly proposed that the forms of oath should be forwarded by the Court of Basrah to the ministry of Foreign Affairs, who would in their turn forward them through His Majesty's .jnbassy to the Political Agent, Kuwait, so that he could administer the oaths and return the forms duly completed through the same channels. 3. Your excellency will be aware th-t this is the normal procedure in such cases and in this connection I would refer you to the Ministry's note No*6429 of the 12th July and to tiie reply from His Majesty's .jnbassy No.466 of the 1st September 1933. It appears, however, that the Ministry have recently informed the Court at Basrah that they do not agree/ s Excellency Jamal eg Baban, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Baghdad•agree to the oath being administered in this inanner, 4* If the above report is correct, I am at a loss to understand why the kinistry are unwilling to follow the normal procedure in this case and 1 hope that Your excellency may see your way to intervene in the matter with a view to the reconsideration of their decision, lour excellencyvd11 realise that in view of the present troubles, which formed the subject of note Ko*488 of August 24th, it is particularly important that the fellaheen on the Shaikh's estates should not receive the impression that obstacles are being placed in the way of the Shaijh's efforts to 6btain justice.

Shaikh of Kuwaiti Date Gardens in^lraq Sir V I have the honour to refer to correspondence resting with your Printed Letter No.C/285, dated Kuwait, the 22nd / September 1934, and to state that I have received another letter from His Excellancy the Shaikh (No.R4/l710,dated the 23rd September 1934) of which I enclose a translation. 2. From the above quoted letter of the Shaikh you will see that the Basra Court has actually notified to the Shaikh’s lawyer at Basra that His Excellency should personally present himself before the Court on the 29th October to give the necessaryevidence on oath. ^ i 3. This procedure, as already explained in my letter No.C-223', dated the 28th July 1934, has been ruled out of the question, since His Excellency the Shaikh, as an independent Ruler, has once before refused to comply with a similar demand and, it would appear, is fully justified in doing so again. 4. I would, therefore, request, if you see no objection that urgent representation throu^i the usual channel may be made to the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, asking for instructions to be issued to the Basra Court not to proceed with the case pending settlement of the matter under reference I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant Major, Political Agent, KuwaitTraislation of a confidential letter No.34/1710 dated the 13th Jamad Thani 1353, corresponding to the 23rd September 193 4, from His Sjcoellency the Shaikh of Kuweit to the Political Agent, Kuwait. After Compliments, '7ith reference to my letter FO.R4/1585, dated the 13th Rabi’ Thani 1353, corresponding to the 26th July 1934, I forward, herewith, copy of a letter No.R/l/86, dated the 21st September 1934, which I have received from my lawyer at Basra, regarding the question of taking an oath in respect of those dates belonging to me, which the fellaheen of Rao have refused to hand over to me. were proved to be due to me from the said fellaheen. These fellaheen, however, have since then been endeavouring to evade payment; and the Court, as you will see, has lately decided that I should appear personally on the 29th October 1934 and take the oath before the Court. In a previous letter I wrote to you, I requested that the matter might kindly be referred to the British Embassy at Baghdad for necessary action. I am not alarmed about swearing this oath, for wh&gt; t I have claimed is my rightful property, but it is quite impossible for me to be present personally as desired by the Court. This fact is well known to them (the Iraq officials) but they are endeavouring bo make me lose .ay rights by making such trifling excuses, else why should they object to my taking the oath indirectly through you as was done before. I would refer you to Colonel Dickson 1 s letter to me, No.423, dated the 23rd Rebi’ Than! 1352 (14/8/33) and my reply to him, No.R/3/1130, dated the 24th Rabi T Thani 1352/(15.8.33) from which you will perceive that the Iraq Government had once asked through the British Embassy, aghded, that an oath be sworn by me indirectly. / btter many proceedings the abovementioned dates I beg/2 uhT I beg, therefore, to request that you will kindly take up this matter and do your best to get it settled before the date specified (for me to present myself before the Court) so that we may not lose our rights# I am confident that His Majesty T s G-or ernment do not wish our rights to be usurped, and that they will defend our prestige by every means# Usual Ending#Translation of a letter No. T /l/86, dated the 21st September 1934, received by His Excellency shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as-Sabah, K.C.I.E., Ruler of Kuwait, from his lawyer at Basra, % Respects etc, I wrote to Your Excellonoy previously to the effect that the Ministry of Justice had notified the courts here that the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs objected to th^ conveyance to Your Excellency of the form of oath which was to be sworn by Your Excellency in connection with the cases lodged again,^t certain 'Taaba' fellaheen of ? ao. Pleadings had taken place for 48 cases out of 53 cases of precautionary distraint originally lodged against some of the 'T aba' fellaheen of Fao. The result in them all was that Your Excellency’s rights were confirmed, and the correctness of the ’Pledge &gt; anads’which I had last year obtained from the said fellaheen was proved - and consequent ly your Excellency’s right of ownership. The opponent’s lawyer, however, alleged that the correct quantities of dates have been fully delivered. But as there was no way to prove such delivery against the Sanads we hold, save by production of signed receipts, and as the fellaheen were unabl to produce such receipts, their lawyer demanded that Your Excellency should taken an oath that you have not received the correct quantities of dates mentioned in the fanads which we hold and tfiich have been shown to the Court. Owing to the objection of the Ministry of Justice which acted in conformity with the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to the administration of the oath to Your Excellency through the British Consul at Kuwait, the Court has now decided that Your Excellency should be present jersonally at the Court on the 29th October 1934 to s^wear the oath required from Your Excellency. The opponents’ lawyer knew perfectly well that his clients, the fellaheen had not paid the correct qualitiesquantities of dates, but as he knew also that the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs had objected to Your ’Excellency swearing the oath indirectly and was sure that Your Excellency would never appear before the Court personally, he tried to prove his allegation by any means. Your Excellency is well aware of the great difficulties and obstacles, with which I have been confronted since the time Your Excellency entrusted to me the administration of your vast properties, and how I succeeded in obtaining from your opponents those legal documents which proved Your Excellency’s rights, Wow if these rights are going to be lost in such an unfortunate way, there will be by no means by which to recover your rights and to protect your properties in future; and the fellaheen and 'Taabeen' will no doubt be encouraged to usurp Your Excellency’s rights. I beg, therefore, to request that measures necessary for insuring the consent of the Ira4i Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Your Excellency swearing the oath indirectly through the British Consul at Kuwait, as is the procedure followed by all the courts of Iraq, be taken immediately, and that the Ministry’s consent be communicated to the courts here before the 29th October; otherwise the court will no doubt consider that Your Excellency is evading the oath and will decide on the rejection of all our oases because of Your Excellency’s failure to appear on the day specified. Again I request that the matter may be put right while there is time, otherwise we will lose our rights and with them Hs.6000/- aporoxinB tely, which we have paid as expenses and fees of the distraint and cases and which should be incurred by the opponents, when decision is issued in our favour after Your Excellency has taken the oath required.

POLITICAL AGENCY KUWAIT The 25th October 1934 From Lt.-Colonel H.R.P.Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, Kuwait; To The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushife. Shaikh of Kuwaiti Date Gardens in Iraq. sir In continuation of my telegram No.276, dated the 24th October, I have the honour to enclose for your information, translations of the following dooumen (a) Confidential letter (marked URGENT) No.R. . dated the 20th October 1934 from H.E. the Shaikh to myself, with following enclosures: ^ 'IvJ (b) Extract from letter No.Sl/lOl,^dated Basra, the 17th October 1934, from Mr.Gabriel, Attorney to the (o) Letter No.Nil, dated the 4th October from Justice of the Peace Huqqi al Jaibaji to Messrs:Gabriel and Partner. The letters speak for themselves. 2. He, the Shaikh, followed up his letter ((a)above) by an official visit to the Agency on 23rd October, and recapitulated at length and with some excitement, the events leading up to the efforts of the Iraq Government to short circuit H.M* s Embassy in Baghdad, and get documents served direct on him, the Shaikh, and also the demand of the Abul Khasib (Basra) Court, that the Shaikh^ should attend in person and take certain oath by 29th October else the said Court T s order already given in his favour against certain recalcitrant fellahs, would be declared null and \ void. As the Shaikh became somewhat heated during theduring the recital of the story, I suggested that he should send me his Secretary, K.B.Mulla Saleh, a man of great shrewdness, to explain the Whole trouble tome from its incipiency. This His Sxcellenoy agreed to do, and shortly after his departure, he sent along the official in question, 4* K.B.Mulla Saleh gave me the following story, which to enable the situation to be quite clearly understood, I am repeating somewhat at length below, although the relevant facts appear to have already been reported by Major Watts, before I returned frcm leave. (a) In the early Summer of IQSS^and before the Date crop had ripened, the shaikh’s fellahs were given certain money advances to improve their holdings, and according to usual custom 'thammaned vt the forthcoming crop, that is to say, they contracted to pay their landlord his share of the date crop for 1933, as soon as it was ripe, the balance of the crop going to themselves. 'Thaman' was carried through by the Shaikh’s lawyer, Mr.Gabriel, and regular 'S&amp;nads' were taken from the fellahs. (b) When the Autumn came round some 53 fellahs knowi as 'Taaba' or 'Taabeen” consisting mostly of the same persons who gave trouble in 1932, suddi suddenly refused to pay the Shaikh his land lord’s share. The amounts due from these 53 men, came to approximately 1600 Iraqi Maunds of Dates (i.e.280,000 lbs.) valued at Rs.8000 apart from money advances. (c) The Shaikh’s lawyer dm instructions frcm the Shaikh did not worry about certain other fellahs who also owed dates, but whose debts were trifling, but took a serious view of the oases of the men mentioned above, and who apparently once again were out for trouble. (d) The Agent after repeatedly warning the 53 men, put them into Court at Abul Khasib, a© a sub court of Basra, in January 1954. (©) The Court started postponing the case for various reasons until June 1954, when it final ly gave judgement in favour of the Shaikh and ordered the fellahs to pay. f) The fellahs, who had engaged a local lawyer, while accepting the Courts judgement petitioned Baghdad and prayed that as was customary in such cases the Shaikh himself as their landlord should be/made to swear an oath that he had not received any part of the dates due to him from them. (g) Apparently the next move (and this has been stated to be a fact by the Shaikh’s lawyer) was for the Ministry of Justice in Baghdad, acting on specific instructions from the ? oreign Ministry to instruct the Basra Courts not only to order the Shaikh to take the necessary oath, but also to inform the Shaikh that he should appear in person at Abdul Khasib, and take the said oath by the 2 9th October 1934, otherwise his already won case against his tenants would go by default. (h) The Shaikh’s Lawyer protested strongly, and pointed out that it was impossible as well as unreasonable to expect that the Shaikh, an independent Ruler, should come up to Basra, and added that his master would most willingly, as he had done on a similar occasion in August 1953, take the necessaxy oath in writing before the Chief Judge of Kuwait (Qazi), have the document attested by H.M’s Political tigent, Kuwait, and send same to the Court through the medium of the British Ambassador, Baghdad. (i) The Court refused the request and demanded the Shaikh’s personal presence, on the plea that4 that an oath taken in another place and outside the precincts of the Court was invalid. (j) The Court in the meantime and at the request ox the Shaikh’s Lawyer passed a further order that the dates of the defendants should be distrained till the 29th October (i.e. they were forbidden to sell or part with them), (k) The next act of the Lawyer was to report the situation to the shaikh, and to urge him to take the case up with all possible speed, with the Political Resident and the British Ambassador. (l) This was done and the .Shaikh wrote his letters N0.R4/1585, dated the 26th July 1934, and 'To. 1710, dated the 22nd September 1934 both &gt;f which were forwarder to you by Major fatts. (m) The Shaikh’s Lawyer holds four special Powers of Attorney from Shaikh under which he is authorized, among other things,to take full charge of his Faddaghiyeh, Fao, Mataawa and Basra House properties, and proceed against any tenants in the local courts, who may create difficulties, or do not pay rentals etc. These Powers of Attorney have each been seperately registered in Baghdad in the 5. I hay ^ ^ted. exactly as told me by the Shaikh and by his Secretary.’ anc I cannot naturally vouch for every thing told me, until I have seen Mr.Gabriel, the Shaikh’s Lawyer. This I hope to do on 30th October. 6. Prime facie, and on the assumption that the mail facts are correct, I think that the Iraq Government are Ministry of Justice under date 2nd January 1934.5 are, to put it in the mildest possible way, showing most regrettable lack of courtesy towards a friendly and neighbour -ing ruler, who after all is acting in the only legal manner open to him, in his efforts to recover rental and advances of money from his tenants. 7. As far as I can see the Shaikh has a perfectly good case, and on the following grounds: (a) He has in the past refused to agree to service of any documents on Kuwait subjects, issuing from the Iraq Courts, except through the British Ambassador, The Iraq Government accepted this point of view and for long have acted accordingly, tfhy then should the Iraq Courts suddenly start, and apparently at the instance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, try and short circuit the ISmbassy and upset established procedure ina matter concerning himself personally (b) There is perfectly good preced taking any oath required of him by the Iraq Courts, before the Chief Judge of Kuwait. The documents being attested by the Political Agent. (c) The Iraq Ministry of Foreign Affairs for political reasons would appear to have interfered improperly in the affairs of the Court at Abul Khasib, firstly by refusing to forward through the proper channel, certain papers which the Court wanted served on the Shaikh, and secondly by Insisting that the Shaikh should be told by the said Court that he must attend and take a certain oath in parson and by a certain date on pain of losing his whole case. 8. Although I know little about Law, I believe it is the current practice among world states, when civil aiits are involved, for foreign nationals to be permitted to take oath before the judicial authorities of their ovm country, and have same attested and forwarded through the ordinary Diplomatic channels to the country, where Courts are dealing The reply is pretty obvious, I think with the matter.9. It clearly, I think, would be dangerous and unwise for the Shaikh to attend the Iraq Courts in person, even if he wished to do so in private capacity, seeing that questions of his property ; in which His Majesty’s Government are peculiarly and definitely interested^ are involved^and I cannot but think that you will agree with this view. I have the honour to be Your most obedient servant Sir Lt.-Colonel Polltical Agent, KuwaitTranslation of a confidential letter Ko.H4/l780 (marked URGENT) dated the 11th HaJab 1353, corresponding to the 20th October 1934, from His 'hccellency the Ruler of dated the 13th Rabi , Thani 1353 (25.7.34) and the 13th Jaxnad Thani 1353 (22.9.34) respectively, regarding the administration of the oath required from us by the Iraq Government, in connection with the cases of our fellaheen of Fao who have disobediently refused to pay our rights. The period of tin© decreed for the oath will come to an end on the 29th October 1934. If an order to the Court authorizing it to accept my oath indirectly (i.e. in Kuwait in presence of the i adhi and H.M’s Political Agent) be not issued by the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign iiffairs, we shall lose the case and our rights due from the fellaheen will be forfeited. kindly refer the matter very urgently to the competent authorities.

TX Shaikh of Kuwait*8 Date Gardens in Iraq. Sir, Y '&gt;'■ 0 In continuation of my Confidential Despatch No.C.280, dated the 25th October 1934, I have the honour to forward translation of a Confidential Letter |/f No.S.1/104^ dated the 23rd October 1934, from Mr.Gabriel to His Excellency the Shaikh, together with two enclosures (Mulhaqs). 2. The letter and Mulhaqs were sent round to the Agency by the Shaikh without the usual covering letter. They arrived by the hand of the Shaikh 1 s Secretary, K.B. Mulla Saleh. The latter explained that His Excellency had just received the letter ^om Basra by special messenger and wanted to know my opinion on Mr.Gabriel’s proposal that he should plead as per Mulhaq I and failing that that he, the Shaikh, should proceed to Fao and there take the oath required of him by the Iraq Courts there. 5. I informed the Shaikh’s Secretary that I was definitely not at all in favour of either of his Lawyer’s suggestions, in fact that I thorougily condemned them both and requested him to tell his master so at once. 4. Clearly one of two things was happening: Either (a) Mr.Gabriel from strain or overwork was losing his balano or (b) he was deliberately leading the Shaikh into a trap, n an effort to please the other side. To my mind proposal I was foolish, and proposal IX./ 5.proposal II was even more so seeing that if the Shaikh in a moment of panic adopted it, he would be playing straight into the Iraq Government T s hands* This quite apart from going behind the back of His Majesty’s Government. 6. I saw His Excellency the Shaikh myself later in the day, and he at once rushed forward and thanked me for my advice as sent through his Secretary. He laughingly said that he had himself never dreamed of acting on his Lawyer’s suggestion, but had merely desired to know if my views were the same as his. He was glad to know that they were. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, LT Lt 'A Political Agent, ••Colonel, Kuwait.r®) Translation of a confidential letter Ho.S-1/104, dated the 14th Rajah 1353, corresponding to the 23rd October 1934, received by His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait, from his Lawyer, Mr.Agoob Gabriel, Basra. After Compliments, No intimation has as yet been received by the Justice of Peace, Abul~ Kha sit Court, of the agreement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the administration of oath on Your Excellency indirectly through the British Consul at Kuwait. I am afraid intimation will be delayed and the Court will consequently dismiss our cases which number 53. This, as Your Excellency is well aware, will cause very heavy loss of a financial and prestige nature, and of course all kinds of evil consequences will follow. In fact my whole mind is deeply stirred with anxiety, as I can find no way out, or satisfactory medicine for this alarming trouble (lit: disease). I am indeed sore perplexed and deprived of quiet sleep at night in particular because of this alarming problem, and generally over other questions from the first that affect Your Excellency. Difficulties and obstacles/have been put in my way from all sources and directions* I have pondered deeply over the situation, and over the consequences that may follow, especially also of the acticn that should be taken in case no intimation shall have been received by Monday the 29th October 1934; and last night while I was lying on bed a possible legal way out of the difficulty entered my head. It was as follows, and I hope, may suggest success. I have put my idea down on paper (see 2 Mulhaqs at tached) in the form of a special plea to the Court, and am herewith forwarding,/or Your Excellency’s perusal. Should Your Excellency approve of same and agree to it, please send me the following telegram: 'Agoob, Lawyer, Basra. I agree to the contents of your letter No.8-1/104, dated 23rd October 1934.” , This/TRANSLATION Mulhaq No«l» As my client is the Ameer of Kuwait State and Head of its Government, and as the Iraqi Government, having no Consul at Kuwait, is represented by the British Consul,there, it is impossible for my client, His Excellency the Ameer,to enter Iraq without having a passport, that must bear a visa from the British Consul in Kuwait. The British Consul, how ever, on political grounds has objected to the issue of visas on the passports of my client, His Excellency the Ameer and his staff. Hence at the moment His Excellency’s presence is impossible. The jurisprudents’ decree in practice however, is that when the presence of a client to swear an oath directed to him on account of the failure of the defendant to substitute his payment, is impossible, an order should be given that payment should be made by the defendant to the plaintiff’s attorney, without prejudice to the defendant’s right to swear the plaintiff’e when he turns up. Should the plaintiff, then, give the oath, it will be well anrt good. Should, on the other hand, he fail to do so, the defendant shall have the right to recover what he had paid to the plaintiff’s attorney. This has been confirmed in commentary on Article 1745 of the 'Majella' by Dr.Ali Haider Sff. (Vol.IV P.572). Accordingly I request thfct the defendant be ordered to pay to me, in my capacity as the plaintiff’s at torney, the amount claimed plus court expenses and my fee, together with interest from the date of registration of cases and confirmation of precautionary distraint.TRANSLATION cxS) MULHACy, NO.2, It is quite possible that the Court will not accept the above special pleading (Mulhaq No.l) and will dismiss our cases* In that event I think that the best course is for Your Excellency to unofficially proceed by sea to Fao on Sunday evening next, so as to reach Fao suddenly on the morning of Monday the 29th October 1934, At 10 A.M # Your Excellency will appear in the Court at Fao (where I can arrange for the case to be heard) and will swear the oath required of you. This will settle the case. Your Excellency will then return to your Capital without any trouble. This is the wisest plan to save the situation and defeat our opponents. As Your Excellency knows, the Court is a house for maintaining justice and upholding the honourable Shar’a Law. In it appear Kings, sultans and ordinary subjects side by side in veneration for the Shar f a. Should Your Excellency decide to come and appear in the Fao Court, I feel sure that not one of the ^Ta’abeen' will dare come and face Your Excellency. Hence they will lose their right to ask oath from you, and judgement must be given against them in default, without the actual need of Your Excellency taking oath at all, which is not allowed except in presence of the opponent. Is there any objection to Your Excellency’s presence? It will, I feel sure, save the situation and defeat our enemies, as well as their plans which will be brought to nought. Lastly our enemies will at last come to their senses.■■CONFID}SNTIAL, No •C-282. POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT, The 26th October 1934.
