The rest of the tile is given over to a bird's-eye representation of the Great Mosque in Mecca, with the Ka'ba, Islam's holiest shrine, in the center surrounded by various other structures, all identified in Arabic, and a rectangular portico around the courtyard.\r\n\r\nSuch tiles may have been created to remind Muslims of their obligation to make the pilgrimage and to introduce potential hajji, or pilgrims, to the places and practices they would encounter in Mecca. The plaques also may have been intended for commemoration and contemplation following a hajji's experience at the Ka'ba.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1897", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/17197", "Keywords": "Great Mosque at Mecca; Ka'ba; Muslim; Arabic; ceramic; map; calligraphy; pattern; decorative", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1897 [mode of acquisition unknown];  Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "Ottoman Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:15:21.16", "Creator": "Turkish", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL1_48.1307_VwA_TR_T97.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL1_48.1307_VwA_TR_T97.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL1_48.1307_VwA_TR_T97.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL1_48.1307_VwA_TR_T97.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL1_48.1307_VwA_TR_T97.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1501462", "ExhibIDs": "13, 2037, 579", "Images": "PL1_48.1307_VwA_TR_T97.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Third Floor: Islamic Art"}
