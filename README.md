# DLME Metadata

This repo contains records for the DLME based on stewarding institions and collections. Institutions have their own directories with collections as sub directories when the concept of 'collection' is used as an organizing strategy. For some collections, the scripts that were used for processing the metadata are also included. 

Much of this data was included for the purposes of testing the prototype. Each collection may need to be reviewed by the curatorial advisors to determine if it should ultimately be included in the DLME.
