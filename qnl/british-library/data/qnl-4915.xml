By Sections 44 and 45 of the Bahrain Order in council it is laid down that when a Bahrain subject desires to institute a complaint or bring a suit against a person to whom that Order applies, or a person to whom that Order applies desires to institute a complaint or bring a suit against a Bahraini, the political Agent shall entertain the same and may:- (a) with the concurrence of the Shaikh of Bahrain himself heat? and determine it in his District Court.

(e) refer it to arbitration, with the consent of ti the parties* (f) refer the casd to the Qadhi. As the weather is now stormy and frequent sea trips between Manamah and Kuarraq must cause much inconven ience to Kis Excellency Shaikh Hamad I propose if he concurs to refer to the Joinst Court only the cases in which a Bahrain subjext is the defendant or the accused, while dealing myself v/ith all action brought against a protected pweson.
