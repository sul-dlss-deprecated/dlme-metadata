Dated New Delhi, the December 1931. Sir, a I am directed to refer to the^correspondence ending with telegram from the Government ox India in the Foreign and Political Department No. 3178-3., dated the 18th December 1931, and to state that on the material so far available the Govern ment of India are inclined to doubt whether the procedure adopted in the earlier phases of this attempt to restore the authority of the Muscat State in Aiqa was not calculated to lead to a situation of some embarrassment. In particular the wisdom of the Political Agent*s action in accompanying Saiyid Said to Aiqa on board one of His Majesty's ships without having consulted superior authority regarding the action to be taken should the Bani Bu Ali not prove amenable to reason appears to be questionable. The Government of India are also inclined to the opinion that the course of action suggested to the Council of Ministers i.e. the interception of Aiqa dtows by the Muscat'y ) ^ Muscat launch and levies is perhaps hardly consistent with the policy and practice of His Majesty^ Government in the Persian Gulf, particularly if such action were to be taken on the high seas. 2. The Government of India will be glad to receive any comments which you may have to offer in the light of these remarks on the incidents mentioned, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (with 1 spare copy)cohfihektial. No. 19-3 &lt; of 1932. British Residency &amp; Consulate-General, Bushire, tiie 16th Jeuiuary 1932. From - The Hon*ble Lt.Colonel H.V # Biscoe f I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To - The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Hew Delhi. Sir, t h I have the honour to invite a reference to Foreign and Political Department letter Ho.F.570-H/31, dated the 29th December 1931. In this the Government of India said th t they were inclined to doubt whether the procedure adopted in the earlier phases of this attempt to restore the authority of the Muscat State in Aiqa was not calculated to lead to a situation of some eabarraasment, and they questioned the wisdom of the Political Agent's action and also of the course of action suggested to the Council of Ministers, namely, the inter- ijt ception of Aiqa dhows by a Muscat launch. 2. The facts of the case are as follows# On the 30th September the Political Agent telegraphed to the Acting Political Resident that Saiyid Said had asked for a passage in a sloop and was taking 50 levies with him in the launch with the intention of completing the customs control over Aiqa, and had invited the Political Agent to accompany him. Captain Alban supported the proposal and stated that there would be no difficulty. MaJ or Fowle telegraphed in reply to the effect that a sloop could only be of moral assistance and that under no ... ' fTi / U b sy f i2- no circumsteuices could any active assistance of any kind be given. He instructed the Political Agent to explain this clearly to Saiyid Said and stated that if Saiyid Said and the Political Agent were confident that the sloop's presence under / these conditions would give him the necessary moral backing to carry out what he wanted in view of success already achieved he was prepared to approach the Senior Naval Officer. 3. The Political Agent telegraphed back stating that both he and Saiyid Said had every confidence of success and that the latter asked for support in the event of unforeseen hostility. Major Fowle telegraphed back that he would submit the matter to me when he met me at Kuwait on the 22nd October on my return from leave, but that in the meantime the Political Agent should send him a letter there explaining what Saiyid Said proposed to do to complete the customs control over Aiqa. 4. On the 19th October the Political Agent addressed a further telegram to Major Fowle saying that H.M.S.'•Penzance' was visiting Sur on the 25rd October and that Saiyid Said would be glad if he could be given a passage and had asked the Political Agent to accompany him. To this Major Fowle replied that he had no objection but presumed that the visit was merely one of inspection, and t^t passages would be arranged direct with the Commander of H.M.S.'Penzance'. 5. hen Major Fowle met me at Kuwait on the 22nd October, he discussed the matter with me and we were both agreed that in order to complete the authority of the Muscat State over Sur it was essential to deal ultimately with the Bani Bu Ali at Aiqa, but we did not decide on any definite time or method of action and I said I would await a report from Major Fowle on the subject after his return to Muscat. tfe neither of us anticipated that the issue would be definitely raised in view of the fact that Captain Alban had been told to submit proposals forr y -3- for action at Snr for approral, am that Major Powle had telegraphed to him that he assumed the visit in H.M.S. 'Penzance' was merely an ordinary visit of inspection. On the 28th October, however, I received two tele- arams from Captain Alban saying that the Bani Bu Ali had A refu 9e&lt;i to come and interview Saiyid baid and himself and had defied the Wall* Captain Alban stated that this insult called for prompt and exemplary punishment and suggested a number of exceedingly drastic measures, namely, that the Havy should watch for Aiqa boats at sea and should blockade Sur, /, ' . ■ ■ / and further that he should take charge of the levies and occupy Aiqa fort. From these telegrams it was evident that Saiyid . / Said accompanied by the Political Agent had definitely raised /l the issue of Aiqa, despite the fact that the latter had been instructed to submit his proposals for prior approval, and I think he was clearly wrong in doing so. Major ^owle did not wish the issue to be raised until he had consulted me, and I was not prepared to recoamend any action at Aiqa until I had received Major Fowle f s detailed report, and told him that only on the very strongest grounds would I recommend any steps being taken there till the following summer. The time to take action at Aiqa is when the dhows have all come in for the summer, namely, in June or July. It is then comparatively easy to bring pressure to bear on the local inhabitants. Captain Alban however was, I think, over-confident that no difficulty would occur and raised the issue without awaiting definite authority. On the other hand, it is clear from the Council of Ministers' letter of the 30th October to the .Political Agent, S\ a copy of which was forwarded to the Government of India with my despatch No.C»l of 20 th Hovember 1931, that Saiyid Said h ft didV -4- did not take up in any way an aggressive attitude towards the Bani Bu Ali, All he asked them to do was to come and discuss matters with him, and the first evening they did so, and adopted a very conciliatory attitude. The next morning, however, they appear to have got alarmed, and instead of the leading men returning themselves they sent a number of individuals of no importance whatsoever to represent them and with whom it was obviously impossible for Saiyid 3aid to discuss matters and whose very presence was insulting to him, and even when the latter sent the ^ali to ask them to appear before Saiyid Said they refused to do so. ^hile therefore I think the Political Agent must be blamed to some extent for allowing the issue to be raised at all it can be urged on his behalf that actually it was raised in a very harmless manner. It was the intention of Saiyid Said and Captain Alban to have an amicable discussion with the people of Aiqa, and if they adhered to their refusal to pay customs dues, then to submit proposals for dealing with the situation. It was only the insulting behaviour of the Bani Bu Ali at Aiqa that brought matters to a head. s » A8 regards my own action in authorising the Muscat State to seize an Aiqa dhow by their own means if opportunity offered, 1 would submit that it seemed desirable, from the reports that I had received, that some notice should be taken promptly of the conduct of the Bani Bu Ali. The State had asked through the Political Agent that His Majesty's Ships should arrest dhows belonging to their own subjects,etc.s to requests of this nature 1 was not prepared to accede, but I saw no objection to their taking action against their own subjects by their own means if they chose to do so. Juridically they were in my opinion clearly entitled to do so either within territorial waters or on the high seas: it was a case of a sovereign ...7 ( ~ 5- sovereign State taking action with its own forces against its own subjects* The question of the legality of action on the high seas would only have arisen if they had been taking action against foreign subjects* not against their own subjects. I saw no political objection to such action since I was of opinion that the move might do good and might induce the Bani Bu Ali to see reason, and at any rate would show them that the Muscat State could retaliate against them, while it could do no harm, since the matter could not be allowed to rest where it was without affecting the whole position at Sur, though I was determined to make every effort to effect a settlement by peaceful means if possible# My ' failure to do so was a great disappointment to me, and. aa, rationed in my telegram Uo. £.100 of 15th December 1931 I attribute this failure largely to the influence of a local mullah who has resided in Jaalan for / some years past; of Hejazi origin, he subsequently resided for some years in Cairo and Syria, and undoubtedly exercises much influence over Shaikh Ali. At my previous interview he was helpful and conciliatory. On the present occasion he was exactly the reverse, and prated of the League of Nations and President Wilson's fourteen points, and though I had a long private talk with him, and endeavoured to enlist his support, it was not forthcoming* despite the fact that the Muscat State went to the utmost limits of conciliation, and offered to compensate Shaikh Ali for any pecuniary loss he might sustain for the loss of customs revenue at Aiqa, and assured him that they had no desire to interfere in his tribal affairs in the interior provided he admitted their rights on the coast. 1 have the honour to be # Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lt.Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.SECRET Ho.

The position at Sur was one of great delicacy and although the Government of India had no objection to the President's visiting the place or even to his doing so in one ol His Majesty*8 ships in token of the moral support oi nis Majesty•8 Government and the Government of India, it seems to them obvious that it was a mistake for the Political iigent to do so until he had secured definite authority to put the business there through, by the use of force, if necessary. Both the Officiating Political Resident and the Political Agent should further have realised that it was almost, if not quite, impossible for the Political Agent and the President to visit Sur in one of His Majesty's ships and land there without directly raising theCf - 2 - the question of control at 4icia, auid that, even if it liad laeen possible, a mere visit of inspection, as suggested by the Officiating Political Resident, would have contributed nothing to the solution of the problem. The Political Agent moreover in spite of having been warned that his visit was to be merely one of inspection had no sooner landed at Sur than he advised the President to send for the Bani Bu Ali, and in his own words 'thrash the matter out with them 11 . In the opinion of the Government of India therefore the Officiating Political Resident committed an error of judgment in permitting the Political Agent to go to Sur in^His Majesty^ ships even on a visit of inspection^and the Political Agent by his conduct on arrival there went beyond the authority which had been given to him. 5. The Government of India have no doubt that these errors arose through the natural eagerness of the officers concerned to get the Sur question satisfactorily settled and they have no wish to take too serious a view of the consequences or to hamper unduly the exercise of initiative by their officers, but the fact remains tnat a situation, the result of which can only be to render the problem of restoring control at Aiqa less easy of solution, has thus been created and I am to request that, if you see no objection, an intimation in the sense of the remarks contained in this letter may be conveyed to Major j?owle and Captain Alban. 4. As regards the interception, on the high seas and in territorial waters, of Aiqa dhows by the Muscat launch and Levies, the Government of India agree that in the5 the circumstances created by the visit to 3ur the course adopted was perhaps the only thing that could 'be done to restore the prestige of the Muscat State authorities* But they cannot i^orbear to observe that if the grant of such authority to the Rulers of the Arab States in the Gulf becaiae common&gt; the consequences would obviously be in the extreme undesirable• I have the honour to be &gt; Sir Your most obedient servant.

Oil ice of the Political Hceiaent in the Persian Gulf, Camp» Muscat, ICth a&amp;rch 1932* From The Hon'ble Lieut-Colonel H.V.Biecoe, I.A., Political Reeicent in the Persian Gulf. To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of Incia, New Belhi* Bir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Foreign and Political repartment letter No. F»570~V31 dated the 17th February 1952, regarding the situation at Sur. 2, There woula aeeaa to ue Boase misapprehension regarding the position at -ur, and as this may possiuly have arisen from the fact that I did not in tiy previous letter make the matter sufficiently clear, I ^ouxu venture with all deference to submit the matter again lor the reconsideration of the Government ol Inula. jj # Yhe Government of India state that it was a mistake for the Political Agent to have visited Sur until he had secured definite authority to put the business there through, by the use of force, if nece^tary, and further that Doth the Ofliciating Political Kesiaent ana the Political Agent should have realiseo that it was almost, if not quite, impossible lor the Political Agent and the President to visit 8ur in one of His esty•s ships and lana there without directly raising the question of control at Aiqa, and that, ever, il it nau been possible, a mere visit of inspection would2 wouIq iiave contributea notaing to the eolution of the problem. 4. I woula venture to say that I (So not think thl« view is altogether correct. On the contrary, it would have been quite possible for the Political Agent and the Pretiaent to have visitea Bur without raising the Question of control at Aiqa at all. Sur ie a largieh town with a large number of dhowe and is a faitiy important coicmercial centre as eucn places go in Oaian. Aiqa is a email hamlet on the opposite side of the creek« It was certainly necessary to tackle the question of control at Aiqa for two reasons: firstly, because of the possibility of smuggling through Aiqa, anc seconoly, for reasons of prestige. The Jenebeh woulc not have suo- -mitted indefinitely to the stricter control being exer- •cised over them by the Muscat State if the Bani Bw All in Aiqa hac been openly aole to resist, but the matter was not one of immediate urgency. The Political rvJ Agent ana the Presicent nac already visited Sur at least p* two previous occasions without rAising the question of control at Aiqa, or approaching the Bani Bu Ali. There was no reason why they should not do so a third time, and actually the Sultan and the Political Agent only recently again proceeded to Sur in H. i.* • but of course did not interview tne Bani Bu Ali. Tnis is what the Officiating Political Resident tnought they woulo do. 5, a new customs house was being built at Sur, a a new Shaikh of the Jenebeh had recently been installed, and efforts were bein^ made to improve the customs organ- •iaation there. All these matters demanded constant supervision and it was desirable that when any of His Majesty's ships happened to be visiting Sur, advantage should be taken oi it by the President of the Council to go——go down and Inspect the place, and such t is its had become more or less matters of routine, and in Tiew of the fact that the Political Agent had been told that he was to submit his plans lor eifecting control at Aiqa and that the visit to Sur was merely to be one of inspection, I would submit that the Officiating Political Pesiaent was entitled to assume that the question of control at Aiqa would not be taken up on this occasion. It could certainly perfectly well have been avoided, and I think the Political A^ent was wrong in acvising the Presicent to sena for the Bani Bu Ali. own view therefore, is that the Political Agent and the President of the Council could well, and should, have gone to Sur on an ordinary visit of inspection, and that it was unnecessary for them on this occasion to have raisec the question of Aiqa, and in view of the instructions issued to him the Political Agent shoulo have definitely refraineC irom raising the question. I co notthink, theiclore, that, in common fairness, the Officiating Political Besident can be blamed because action was taken wiiica he had ordered not to be taken. 6, I took advantage of my recent visit to Muscat to communicate the gist of the remarks contained in the letter from the Government of India under reply to Captain Alban. He admitted that he and the President of the Council could have gone to Sur without interview- -ing the Bani Bu Ali, but informed me that on a previous occasion when the President oi the Council had visited Sur. leaders of the Bani Bu Ali at Aiqa had spontaneously and of their own accord come over and paid their respects to the President of the Council* When therefore he euggeetea eenoing lor them on the occasion of the October Tlelt neither he nor the President of the Council imagined that it was likely to lead to any inciaent thatthat would bring matters to a head, and as a matter of fact the first interview was quite friendly. This explains Captain Alban*s action, without I think alto- -gether justifying it, but as he urged it on his own behalf I have thought it desirable to put it before the Government of Ins ia. One thing is mofct clearly denaonstratec, and that is the extraordinary unreliabil- -ity of the character of the semi-savage Arabs of the Oman Coast, and how difficult it is to forecast or fore see their reactions to the most innocent measures or proposals, a fact of which I have had very convincing experience myself in the last six months. I iully anticipated, Judging from my previous experience of h:i». that when I visited Sur in Tecember last I should be able to persuade Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah to accept a customs post at Aiqa; the influence of Shaikh Abdullah bin FawwaX the local priest, was thrown into the scales a&amp;ainsw me and I failed. During the recent operations at Sur His Highness the Sultan of Muscat was convinced that the Ban! Bu Ali would not accept the customs poet without some show of resistance; the Shaikh 1 ^'! irst letter was very truculent and His Highness argued tn&amp;t the Jeneoeh, Bani Bu Hasan and other tribes were watthing, anu that the loss of ^sharaf^ would be tremendous if they climbea down without any resistance. My personal view was that the Bani Bu Ali would yield to 'force majcure ,, and tac itly would /accept the post, but would never give any formal undertaking in writing to do so and would try to do some- -thing to save their face. Actually what happened. I unuerstand, was that after the ultimatum was issued a council of war was held, and the general opinion was in favour of making some show of resistance. Then some four or five of the leading Shaikhs ol the Jenebeh went over to Aiqa from Sur. and advised the Bani Bu Ali '•not to/S to be foolB H , anG we have now obtainea Irom Snaika AXi not merely a written acceptance of the cuBtoms post, but a further letter from hliii, in reply to mine warning him againet molesting the post or attempting to evade customs, to the effect that he has instructed hie people not to molest the post, ano to pay their customs aues. The climb down has been complete and abject. It remains to be seen whether they adhere to it, but the generally expressed opinion on the coast is that tticii it- ■ l is definitely crushed.
