A lack of central authority in the region had led to lawlessness along many of the roads, including that between Bushire and Shiraz. The papers cover the British response to the situation, including the discussion over evacuation and the distribution of troops in Shiraz, Isfahan, and Bushire.The volume is divided into two parts, both covering many of the same matters. The main division is chronological, part 1 coming earlier than part 2.The majority of the correspondence is between the Foreign Office, India Office, Government of India, and Minister at Tehran, but included as enclosures are letters and telegrams from the Consulates at Shiraz and Isfahan, and the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf. The papers include handwritten drafts and notes. There is some duplication.The volume comprises parts 1-2 of 2. Each part includes a divider which gives the subject and part numbers, year the subject file was opened, subject heading, and list of correspondence references contained in that part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Fars</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Shiraz</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Law enforcement</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00005a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
