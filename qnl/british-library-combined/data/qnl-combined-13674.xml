It outlines his visits to Rumss, Rassool Khyma [Ra's al-Khaymah], Jeziratool Humra, Umal Guwyn [Umm al Qaywayn], Eymaum [Ajman], and Sharga [Sharjah]. For each place he reports on the Shaikh that holds power, and their disposition towards the General Maritime Treaty 1820. It notes if anyone that signed the treaty has since been deposed, and reports on the attitude of the new Shaikh in power. It is noted that all accept their obligations under the treaty, but that not everyone is equally informed as to what these are.It notes that most of the Shaikhs met by the Resident all acknowledge the supremacy of Sooltan bin Suggur [Sul&#7789;&#257;n bin Saqr]. However, it reports that the Resident has explained to all parties that the British consider each individual Shaikh to be responsible for the vessels at their own ports, regardless of who they pledge allegiance.The only exception to this is noted as Shaikh Rasched bin Hoomied, who does not acknowledge Sooltan bin Suggur's supremacy, but instead claims to be allied with Sa&#8216;&#299;d bin Sult&#257;n &#256;l Sa&#8216;&#299;d, the Imam of Muscat, and that he is suffering attacks from him as a result. Sooltan bin Suggur however claims the Shaikh has broken a pledge of allegiance to him.The Resident's discussion with Sooltan bin Suggur at Sharga is outlined in detail. The discussion centred on his obligations under the General Maritime Treaty, and the responsibilities of the Shaikhs that accept his authority. His conflict with the Imam of Muscat was also discussed; the Resident explained that while the British desire peace in the Persian Gulf, they do not claim the power to enforce it, or to settle disputes between chiefs. The Resident also briefly reports on encounters with other Shaikhs that met him at Sharga, and mentions that Captain Frederick Faithfull successfully completed his arrangements for stationing cruizers and the renewal of ships registers.Next the letter outlines the Resident's visit to the islands of Bidda and Bahrain. It outlines his discussion with the Shaikhs of Bahrain in detail; in addition to covering the obligations of the General Maritime Treaty, they discussed their dispute with the Imam of Muscat, their dispute with Rama bin Jauber [Ra&#7717;mah bin J&#257;bir], and the recent capture of a Bahrani batille (a small sea going vessel) by HMS
                           Sophie, which was itself caught in the act of seizing a boat from Bushire.The letter outlines the Resident's views concerning the state of the Persian Gulf and the condition of its chiefs. It starts with Sooltan bin Suggur, whom the Resident regards as the most prominent. It outlines the Resident's understanding of his current position and ambitions with respect to the other Shaikhs on the Arabian coast, and his political situation in relation to the Imam of Muscat, along with Rasched bin Hoomied. It also outlines the size of Sooltan bin Suggur's current fleet. It explains the Resident's view that an Arabian coast controlled by him could be a desirable outcome for the British, but that it is not a course without risks, and the Resident is uncertain how to respond to his request to be able to rebuild the land facing fortifications at Sharga. It is recommended that a native agent is placed with Sooltan bin Suggur to facilitate future communication.Following on from Sooltan bin Suggur, the letter outlines the position of a number of other chiefs along the Arabian coast, starting with Shaikh Jahnoon. It outlines the circumstances, resources, and allegiances of each chief. At the same time, it discusses the likelihood that some will cause trouble for the British, and includes recommendations from the Resident on how they should be handled.A report on the slave trade in the Persian Gulf is included, as the Resident has observed that slaves are still sold in the markets at Bahrain and Muscat. It concludes that article nine of the General Maritime Treaty is unclear, and that the Resident cannot be sure how it is interpreted by the various other parties of the treaty; the Resident therefore recommends that the article is either not enforced, or that it is enforced on the basis that only the taking of slaves is forbidden, but that they may still be purchased then transported. It is explained that the British have little hope of stopping the slave trade so long as other powers in the Gulf continue to permit its practice.The letter explains that the Resident is uncertain as to the effect the removal of British troops from Kishm [Qeshm] will have, as he believes that they have been instrumental in ensuring peace in the region. It is explained that plans to maintain a naval force in the area have convinced the Arab chiefs that the British are not ceding control, but that the proposed force is not sufficient.The Resident also reports on where the Jawassmees [Qaw&#257;sim] get their arms and material for ship buildings. The letter also outlines their principle means of income, but the Resident believes it to be currently insufficient to survive on commerce alone.Enclosed is a communication from the 'Pirate Chiefs' (named in the signature in full) to the Governor of Bombay, dated January 1822. The enclosed letter proclaims that its signatories are under the authority of Sooltan bin Suggur.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054362.0x00000d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods>	</en_metadata>
